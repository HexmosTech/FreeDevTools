</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Math::Symbolic::Variable - Variable in symbolic calculations

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Math::Symbolic::Variable;

         my $var1 = Math::Symbolic::Variable-&gt;new('name');
         $var1-&gt;<a href="../man5/value.5.html">value</a>(5);

         my $var2 = Math::Symbolic::Variable-&gt;new('x', 2);

         my $var3 =
           Math::Symbolic::Variable-&gt;new(
             {
               name  =&gt; 'variable',
               value =&gt; 1,
             }
           );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class implements variables for Math::Symbolic trees.  The objects are overloaded in stringification
       context to return their names.

   <b>EXPORT</b>
       None by default.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Constructor</b> <b>new</b>
       First argument is expected to be a hash reference of key-value pairs which will be used as object
       attributes.

       In particular, a variable is required to have a 'name'. Optional arguments include a 'value', and a
       'signature'. The value expected for the signature key is a reference to an array of identifiers.

       Special case: First argument is not a hash reference. In this case, first argument is treated as variable
       name, second as value.  This special case disallows cloning of objects (when used as object method).

       Returns a Math::Symbolic::Variable.

   <b>Method</b> <b>value</b>
       <b>value()</b> evaluates the Math::Symbolic tree to its numeric representation.

       <b>value()</b> without arguments requires that every variable in the tree contains a defined value attribute.
       Please note that this refers to every variable <u>object</u>, not just every named variable.

       <b>value()</b> with one argument sets the object's value if you're dealing with Variables or Constants. In case
       of operators, a call with one argument will assume that the argument is a hash reference. (see next
       paragraph)

       <b>value()</b> with named arguments (key/value pairs) associates variables in the tree with the value-arguments
       if the corresponging key matches the variable name.  (Can one say this any more complicated?) Since
       version 0.132, an equivalent and valid syntax is to pass a single hash reference instead of a list.

       Example: $tree-&gt;value(x =&gt; 1, y =&gt; 2, z =&gt; 3, t =&gt; 0) assigns the value 1 to any occurrances of variables
       of the name "x", aso.

       If a variable in the tree has no value set (and no argument of value sets it temporarily), the call to
       <b>value()</b> returns undef.

   <b>Method</b> <b>name</b>
       Optional argument: sets the object's name.  Returns the object's name.

   <b>Method</b> <b>signature</b>
       <b>signature()</b> returns a tree's signature.

       In the context of Math::Symbolic, signatures are the list of variables any given tree depends on. That
       means the tree "v*t+x" depends on the variables v, t, and x. Thus, applying <b>signature()</b> on the tree that
       would be parsed from above example yields the sorted list ('t', 'v', 'x').

       Constants do not depend on any variables and therefore return the empty list.  Obviously, operators'
       dependencies vary.

       Math::Symbolic::Variable objects, however, may have a slightly more involved signature. By convention,
       Math::Symbolic variables depend on themselves. That means their signature contains their own name. But
       they can also depend on various other variables because variables themselves can be viewed as
       placeholders for more compicated terms. For example in mechanics, the acceleration of a particle depends
       on its mass and the sum of all forces acting on it. So the variable 'acceleration' would have the
       signature ('acceleration', 'force1', 'force2',..., 'mass', 'time').

       If you're just looking for a list of the names of all variables in the tree, you should use the
       <b>explicit_signature()</b> method instead.

   <b>Method</b> <b>explicit_signature</b>
       <b>explicit_signature()</b> returns a lexicographically sorted list of variable names in the tree.

       See also: <b>signature()</b>.

   <b>Method</b> <b>set_signature</b>
       set_signature expects any number of variable identifiers as arguments.  It sets a variable's signature to
       this list of identifiers.

   <b>Method</b> <b>to_string</b>
       Returns a string representation of the variable.

   <b>Method</b> <b>term_type</b>
       Returns the type of the term. (T_VARIABLE)
