</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Math::Symbolic::Derivative - Derive Math::Symbolic trees

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Math::Symbolic::Derivative qw/:all/;
         $derived = partial_derivative($term, $variable);
         # or:
         $derived = total_derivative($term, $variable);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements derivatives for Math::Symbolic trees.  Derivatives are Math::Symbolic::Operators,
       but their implementation is drawn from this module because it is significantly more complex than the
       implementation of most operators.

       Derivatives come in two flavours. There are partial- and total derivatives.

       Explaining the precise difference between partial- and total derivatives is beyond the scope of this
       document, but in the context of Math::Symbolic, the difference is simply that partial derivatives just
       derive in terms of <u>explicit</u> dependency on the differential variable while total derivatives recongnize
       implicit dependencies from variable signatures.

       Partial derivatives are faster, have been tested more thoroughly, and are probably what you want for
       simpler applications anyway.

   <b>EXPORT</b>
       None by default. But you may choose to import the <b>total_derivative()</b> and <b>partial_derivative()</b> functions.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       The package variable %Partial_Rules contains partial derivative rules as key-value pairs of names and
       subroutines.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>partial_derivative</b>
       Takes a Math::Symbolic tree and a Math::Symbolic::Variable as argument.  third argument is an optional
       boolean indicating whether or not the tree has to be cloned before being derived. If it is true, the
       subroutine happily stomps on any code that might rely on any components of the Math::Symbolic tree that
       was passed to the sub as first argument.

   <b>total_derivative</b>
       Takes a Math::Symbolic tree and a Math::Symbolic::Variable as argument.  third argument is an optional
       boolean indicating whether or not the tree has to be cloned before being derived. If it is true, the
       subroutine happily stomps on any code that might rely on any components of the Math::Symbolic tree that
       was passed to the sub as first argument.
