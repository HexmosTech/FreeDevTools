</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Math::Symbolic::Custom - Aggregate class for tree tests and transformations

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # Extending the class:
         package Math::Symbolic::Custom::MyTransformations;
         use Math::Symbolic::Custom::Base;
         BEGIN {*import = \&amp;Math::Symbolic::Custom::Base::aggregate_import}

         our $Aggregate_Export = [qw/apply_transformation1 .../];
         sub apply_transformation1 {
            # ...
         }
         # ...

         # Using the custom class:
         use Math::Symbolic;
         use Math::Symbolic::Custom::MyTransformations;

         # later...
         $tree-&gt;apply_transformation1();
         $tree-&gt;mod_transformation2();
         die unless $tree-&gt;is_type1();
         die unless $tree-&gt;test_condition1();
         die if $tree-&gt;contains_something1();
         print $tree-&gt;to_latex();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is an aggregate class for all custom modification, transformation, testing and output extensions for
       Math::Symbolic trees.  Some default transformations and tests are implemented in the
       Math::Symbolic::Custom::DefaultMods and Math::Symbolic::Custom::DefaultTests packages, default output
       routines in Math::Symbolic::Custom::DefaultDumpers which are automatically loaded by the
       Math::Symbolic::Custom class.

       Math::Symbolic::Custom imports all constants from Math::Symbolic::ExportConstants

   <b>EXPORT</b>
       None by default.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>MODULE</b></h4><pre>
       In order to extend the functionality of Math::Symbolic, you have to go through the following steps: (also
       see the synopsis in this document.)

       •   Choose  an  appropriate  namespace  in  the Math::Symbolic::Custom::* hierarchy or if you desparately
           wish, somewhere else.

       •   Create a new module (probably using "h2xs -AX MODULENAME") and put the following lines of code in it:

             # To make sure we're cooperating with Math::Symbolic's idea of
             # method delegation.
             use Math::Symbolic::Custom::Base;
             BEGIN {*import = \&amp;Math::Symbolic::Custom::Base::aggregate_import}

             our $Aggregate_Export = [
               # Put the list of method names to be exported.
             /];

       •   Think well about the naming of your exported methods. Answer the following questions:

           Does the name start with 'is_', 'test_', 'mod_', 'apply_', 'contains_', or 'to_'?   If  not,  find  a
           suitable name that does.

           Does  the  name  clash  with  any  of  the  methods exported by Math::Symbolic::Custom::DefaultTests,
           Math::Symbolic::Custom::DefaultMods,  or  Math::Symbolic::Custom::DefaultDumpers?   If   so,   please
           consider choosing a different name.

           Does  the name map to the idea behind the method prefix ('is_', ...)?  Only methods starting with one
           of the prefixes listed above can be delegated. Any others will  never  be  called.  The  idea  behind
           delegating  methods  with  several prefixes is to provide for a reasonable choice for naming methods.
           'is_' and 'contains_' are meant to be used for accurate tests like "is_constant".  'test_'  is  meant
           for all tests that either make use of heuristics or can't be fitted into either 'is_' or 'contains_'.
           The  prefixes 'mod_' and 'apply_' are meant for use with methods that modify the Math::Symbolic tree.
           Finally, the prefix 'to_' is meant to be used with conversion and output methods like  'to_latex'  or
           'to_string'.  (Though  as  of  version  0.122,  to_string  is  implemented in the core Math::Symbolic
           modules.)

       •   Make sure you document exactly what your methods do. Do they modify the Math::Symbolic tree  in-place
           or  do  they clone using the <b>new()</b> constructor and return a copy? Make sure you mention the behaviour
           in the docs.

       •   Consider packaging your extensions as a CPAN distribution to help others in  their  development  with
           Math::Symbolic.  If  you  think  the extensions are generic enough to be a worthwhile addition to the
           core distribution, try sending your extensions to the Math::Symbolic developers mailing list instead.

       •   Load your extension module after loading the Math::Symbolic module.

       •   Start using your custom enhancements as methods to the Math::Symbolic trees (any term types).

       •   Send bug reports and feedback to the Math::Symbolic support mailing list.
