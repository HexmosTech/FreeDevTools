       Config::MVP::Assembler::WithBundles - a role to make assemblers expand bundles

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.200013

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Config::MVP::Assembler::WithBundles is a role to be composed into a Config::MVP::Assembler subclass.  It
       allows some sections of configuration to be treated as bundles.  When any section is ended, if that
       section represented a bundle, its bundle contents will be unrolled and will replace it in the sequence.

       A package is considered a bundle if "package_bundle_method" returns a defined value (which is the name of
       a method that will be called on that package to retrieve its bundle config).

         my $method = $assembler-&gt;package_bundle_method($package);

       The default implementation looks for a method called "mvp_bundle_config", but "package_bundle_method" can
       be replaced with one that returns the name of a different bundle-identifying method-name.

       Bundles are expanded by a call to the assembler's "replace_bundle_with_contents" method, like this:

         $assembler-&gt;replace_bundle_with_contents($section, $method);

   <b>replace_bundle_with_contents</b>
       The default "replace_bundle_with_contents" method deletes the section from the sequence.  It then gets a
       description of the new sections to introduce, like this:

         my @new_config = $bundle_section-&gt;package-&gt;$method({
           name    =&gt; $bundle_section-&gt;name,
           package =&gt; $bundle_section-&gt;package,
           payload =&gt; $bundle_section-&gt;payload,
         });

       (We pass a hashref rather than a section so that bundles can be expanded synthetically without having to
       laboriously create a new Section.)

       The returned @new_config is a list of arrayrefs, each of which has three entries:

         [ $name, $package, $payload ]

       Each arrayref is converted into a section in the sequence.  The $payload should be an arrayref of
       name/value pairs to be added to the created section.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
