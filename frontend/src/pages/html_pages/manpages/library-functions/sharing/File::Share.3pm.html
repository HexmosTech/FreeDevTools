</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::Share - Extend File::ShareDir to Local Libraries

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use File::Share ':all';

           my $dir = dist_dir('Foo-Bar');
           my $file = dist_file('Foo-Bar', 'file.txt');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is a dropin replacement for File::ShareDir. It supports the "dist_dir" and "dist_file"
       functions, except these functions have been enhanced to understand when the developer's local "./share/"
       directory should be used.

       NOTE: module_dist and module_file are not yet supported, because (afaik) there
             is no well known way to populate per-module share files. This may change
             in the future. Please contact me if you know how to do this.

</pre><h4><b>PROBLEM</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SOLUTION</b></h4><pre>
       Module::Install has an "install_share" directive that allows you to install various files associated with
       a distribution. By convention, module authors always put these in a directory called "share/". However,
       File::ShareDir can only find files after they have been installed. This can be problematic when running
       development tests.

       File::Share will look for a local "share" directory, if it notices that the module corresponding was
       loaded from a development path.

       Devel::Local gives you an easy way to use a bunch of source repositories as though their lib and bin
       directories had already been installed.  "File::Share" lets you play along with that.
