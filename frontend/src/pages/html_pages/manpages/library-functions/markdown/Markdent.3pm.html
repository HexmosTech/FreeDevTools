</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Markdent - An event-based Markdown parser toolkit

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.40

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Markdent::Simple::Document;

           my $parser = Markdent::Simple::Document-&gt;new;
           my $html   = $parser-&gt;markdown_to_html(
               title    =&gt; 'My Document',
               markdown =&gt; $markdown,
           );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This distribution provides a toolkit for parsing Markdown (and Markdown variants, aka dialects). Unlike
       the other Markdown Perl tools, this module can be used for more than just generating HTML. The core
       parser generates events (like XML's SAX), making it easy to analyze a Markdown document in any number of
       ways.

       If you're only interested in converting Markdown to HTML, you can use the Markdent::Simple::Document
       class to do this, although you can just as well use better battle-tested tools like Text::Markdown.

       See Markdent::Manual for more details on how Markdent works and how you can use it.

</pre><h4><b>QUICK</b> <b>MARKDOWN</b> <b>TO</b> <b>HTML</b> <b>CONVERSION</b></h4><pre>
       If you just want to do some quick Markdown to HTML conversion use either the Markdent::Simple::Document
       or Markdent::Simple::Fragment class.

       This distribution also ships with a command line tool called markdent-html.  See that tool's
       documentation for details on how to use it.

</pre><h4><b>PROCESSING</b> <b>PIPELINES</b></h4><pre>
       If you want to create a Markdown processing pipeline, start by looking at the various handler classes:

       •   Markdent::Handler::HTMLStream::Document

       •   Markdent::Handler::HTMLStream::Fragment

       •   Markdent::Handler::HTMLStream::Multiplexer

       •   Markdent::Handler::HTMLStream::HTMLFilter

       •   Markdent::Handler::HTMLStream::CaptureEvents

       You  will  probably  also want to write your own handler class as part of the pipeline. This will need to
       implement the Markdent::Role::Handler role.

       To do that you'll need to review the many "Markdent::Event::*" classes. Each event  represents  something
       seen  by  the  parse, such as a piece of the start or end of a piece of block (paragraph, header) or span
       markup (strong, link) or some text.

       The start of a pipeline will generally be either the Markdent::Parser or Markdent::CapturedEvents class.

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOM</b> <b>DIALECTS</b></h4><pre>
       You may also want to implement a custom dialect to add some  additional  features  to  the  parser.  Your
       parser   classes   will   need   to   consume  either  the  Markdent::Role::Dialect::BlockParser  or  the
       Markdent::Role::Dialect::SpanParser role. The best way to understand how a dialect is implemented  is  to
       look at one of the existing dialect classes:

       •   Markdent::Dialect::GitHub::BlockParser

       •   Markdent::Dialect::GitHub::SpanParser

       •   Markdent::Dialect::Theory::BlockParser

       •   Markdent::Dialect::Theory::SpanParser

       You'll  also  need  to  dig  into the core Markdent::Parser::BlockParser and Markdent::Parser::SpanParser
       classes in order to see how these dialects interact with the core parser.

       If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please consider making a  "donation"  to
       me  via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd
       care to offer.

       Please note that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in order for me to continue  working  on  this
       particular  software.  I  will  continue  to  do  so,  inasmuch  as I have in the past, for as long as it
       interests me.

       Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this software much more,  unless
       I  get  so many donations that I can consider working on free software full time, which seems unlikely at
       best.

       To donate, log into PayPal  and  send  money  to  <a href="mailto:autarch@urth.org">autarch@urth.org</a>  or  use  the  button  on  this  page:

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Please report any bugs or feature requests to "<a href="mailto:bug-markdent@rt.cpan.org">bug-markdent@rt.cpan.org</a>", or through the web interface at
       &lt;<a href="http://rt.cpan.org">http://rt.cpan.org</a>&gt;.   I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on your
       bug as I make changes.

       Bugs may be submitted at &lt;https://github.com/houseabsolute/Markdent/issues&gt;.

       I am also usually active on IRC as 'autarch' on "irc://irc.perl.org".
