       Text::Markdown - Convert Markdown syntax to (X)HTML

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Text::Markdown 'markdown';
           my $html = markdown($text);

           use Text::Markdown 'markdown';
           my $html = markdown( $text, {
               empty_element_suffix =&gt; '&gt;',
               tab_width =&gt; 2,
           } );

           use Text::Markdown;
           my $m = Text::Markdown-&gt;new;
           my $html = $m-&gt;markdown($text);

           use Text::Markdown;
           my $m = Text::MultiMarkdown-&gt;new(
               empty_element_suffix =&gt; '&gt;',
               tab_width =&gt; 2,
           );
           my $html = $m-&gt;markdown( $text );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Markdown is a text-to-HTML filter; it translates an easy-to-read / easy-to-write structured text format
       into HTML. Markdown's text format is most similar to that of plain text email, and supports features such
       as headers, *emphasis*, code blocks, blockquotes, and links.

       Markdown's syntax is designed not as a generic markup language, but specifically to serve as a front-end
       to (X)HTML. You can use span-level HTML tags anywhere in a Markdown document, and you can use block level
       HTML tags (like &lt;div&gt; and &lt;table&gt; as well).

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements the 'original' Markdown markdown syntax from:

           <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/</a>

       Note that Text::Markdown ensures that the output always ends with <b>one</b> newline. The fact that multiple
       newlines are collapsed into one makes sense, because this is the behavior of HTML towards whispace. The
       fact that there's always a newline at the end makes sense again, given that the output will always be
       nested in a <b>block</b>-level element (as opposed to an inline element). That block element can be a "&lt;p&gt;"
       (most often), or a "&lt;table&gt;".

       Markdown is <b>not</b> interpreted in HTML block-level elements, in order for chunks of pasted HTML (e.g.
       JavaScript widgets, web counters) to not be magically (mis)interpreted. For selective processing of
       Markdown in some, but not other, HTML block elements, add a "markdown" attribute to the block element and
       set its value to 1, "on" or "yes":

           &lt;div markdown="1" class="navbar"&gt;
           * Home
           * About
           * Contact
           &lt;div&gt;

       The extra "markdown" attribute will be stripped when generating the output.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Text::Markdown supports a number of options to its processor which control the behaviour of the output
       document.

       These options can be supplied to the constructor, or in a hash within individual calls to the "markdown"
       method. See the SYNOPSIS for examples of both styles.

       The options for the processor are:

       empty_element_suffix
           This option controls the end of empty element tags:

               '/&gt;' for XHTML (default)
               '&gt;' for HTML

       tab_width
           Controls indent width in the generated markup. Defaults to 4.

       trust_list_start_value
           If  true, ordered lists will use the first number as the starting point for numbering.  This will let
           you pick up where you left off by writing:

             1. foo
             2. bar

             some paragraph

             3. baz
             6. quux

           (Note that in the above, quux will be numbered 4.)

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       A simple constructor, see the SYNTAX and OPTIONS sections for more information.

   <b>markdown</b>
       The main function as far as the outside world is concerned. See the SYNOPSIS for details on use.

   <b>urls</b>
       Returns a reference to a hash with the key being the markdown reference and the value being the URL.

       Useful for building scripts which preprocess a list of links before the main content.  See  <u>t/05options.t</u>
       for an example of this hashref being passed back into the markdown method to create links.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>IMPLEMENTATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Markdown has been re-implemented in a number of languages, and with a number of additions.

       Those that I have found are listed below:

       C - &lt;<a href="http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount">http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount</a>&gt;
           Discount  -  Original  Markdown, but in C. Fastest implementation available, and passes MDTest.  Adds
           its own set of custom features.

       python - &lt;<a href="http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/">http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/</a>&gt;
           Python Markdown which is mostly compatible with the original, with an interesting extension API.

       ruby (maruku) - &lt;<a href="http://maruku.rubyforge.org/">http://maruku.rubyforge.org/</a>&gt;
           One of the nicest implementations out there. Builds a parse tree internally so very flexible.

       php - &lt;<a href="http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/">http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/</a>&gt;
           A direct port of Markdown.pl, also has a separately maintained 'extra' version, which adds  a  number
           of features that were borrowed by MultiMarkdown.

       lua - &lt;<a href="http://www.frykholm.se/files/markdown.lua">http://www.frykholm.se/files/markdown.lua</a>&gt;
           Port to lua. Simple and lightweight (as lua is).

       haskell - &lt;<a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/</a>&gt;
           Pandoc is a more general library, supporting Markdown, reStructuredText, LaTeX and more.

       javascript - &lt;<a href="http://www.attacklab.net/showdown-gui.html">http://www.attacklab.net/showdown-gui.html</a>&gt;
           Direct(ish) port of Markdown.pl to JavaScript

</pre><h4><b>THIS</b> <b>DISTRIBUTION</b></h4><pre>
       Please note that this distribution is a fork of John Gruber's original Markdown project, and it *is  not*
       in any way blessed by him.

       Whilst  this  code  aims  to be compatible with the original Markdown.pl (and incorporates and passes the
       Markdown test suite) whilst fixing a number of bugs in the original - there may  be  differences  between
       the  behaviour  of  this  module  and  Markdown.pl.  If  you  find  any  differences  where  you  believe
       Text::Markdown behaves contrary to the Markdown spec, please report them as bugs.

       Text::Markdown *does not* extend the markdown dialect in  any  way  from  that  which  is  documented  at
       daringfireball. If you want additional features, you should look at Text::MultiMarkdown.
