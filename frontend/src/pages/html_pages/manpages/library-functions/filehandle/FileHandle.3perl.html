           my $fh = FileHandle-&gt;new;
           if ($fh-&gt;open("&lt; file")) {

               print $fh "corge\n";
               undef $fh;       # automatically closes the file
           }

           my $pos = $fh-&gt;getpos;
           $fh-&gt;setpos($pos);

           $fh-&gt;setvbuf(my $buffer_var, _IOLBF, 1024);

           my ($readfh, $writefh) = FileHandle::pipe;

           autoflush STDOUT 1;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       NOTE: This class is now a front-end to the IO::* classes.

       "FileHandle::new" creates a "FileHandle", which is a reference to a newly created symbol (see the Symbol
       package).  If it receives any parameters, they are passed to "FileHandle::open"; if the open fails, the
       "FileHandle" object is destroyed.  Otherwise, it is returned to the caller.

       "FileHandle::new_from_fd" creates a "FileHandle" like "new" does.  It requires two parameters, which are
       passed to "FileHandle::fdopen"; if the fdopen fails, the "FileHandle" object is destroyed.  Otherwise, it
       is returned to the caller.

       "FileHandle::open" accepts one parameter or two.  With one parameter, it is just a front end for the
       built-in "open" function.  With two parameters, the first parameter is a filename that may include
       whitespace or other special characters, and the second parameter is the open mode, optionally followed by
       a file permission value.

       If "FileHandle::open" receives a Perl mode string ("&gt;", "+&lt;", etc.)  or a POSIX <b>fopen()</b> mode string ("w",
       "r+", etc.), it uses the basic Perl "open" operator.

       If "FileHandle::open" is given a numeric mode, it passes that mode and the optional permissions value to
       the Perl "sysopen" operator.  For convenience, "FileHandle::import" tries to import the O_XXX constants
       from the Fcntl module.  If dynamic loading is not available, this may fail, but the rest of FileHandle
       will still work.

       "FileHandle::fdopen" is like "open" except that its first parameter is not a filename but rather a file
       handle name, a FileHandle object, or a file descriptor number.

       If the C functions <b>fgetpos()</b> and <b>fsetpos()</b> are available, then "FileHandle::getpos" returns an opaque
       value that represents the current position of the FileHandle, and "FileHandle::setpos" uses that value to
       return to a previously visited position.

       If the C function <b>setvbuf()</b> is available, then "FileHandle::setvbuf" sets the buffering policy for the
       FileHandle.  The calling sequence for the Perl function is the same as its C counterpart, including the
       macros "_IOFBF", "_IOLBF", and "_IONBF", except that the buffer parameter specifies a scalar variable to
       use as a buffer.  WARNING: A variable used as a buffer by "FileHandle::setvbuf" must not be modified in
       any way until the FileHandle is closed or until "FileHandle::setvbuf" is called again, or memory
       corruption may result!

       See perlfunc for complete descriptions of each of the following supported "FileHandle" methods, which are
       just front ends for the corresponding built-in functions:

           close
           fileno
           getc
           gets
           eof
           clearerr
           seek
           tell

       See perlvar for complete descriptions of each of the following supported "FileHandle" methods:

           autoflush
           output_field_separator
           output_record_separator
           input_record_separator
           input_line_number
           format_page_number
           format_lines_per_page
           format_lines_left
           format_name
           format_top_name
           format_line_break_characters
           format_formfeed

       Furthermore, for doing normal I/O you might need these:

       $fh-&gt;print
           See "print" in perlfunc.

       $fh-&gt;printf
           See "printf" in perlfunc.

       $fh-&gt;getline
           This  works  like &lt;$fh&gt; described in "I/O Operators" in perlop except that it's more readable and can
           be safely called in a list context but still returns just one line.

       $fh-&gt;getlines
           This works like &lt;$fh&gt; when called in a list context to read all the remaining lines in a file, except
           that it's more readable.  It will also <b>croak()</b> if accidentally called in a scalar context.

       There are many other functions available since FileHandle is descended from IO::File,  IO::Seekable,  and
       IO::Handle.  Please see those respective pages for documentation on more functions.
