</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bio::Tools::Alignment::Trim - A kludge to do specialized trimming of      sequence based on quality.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Bio::Tools::Alignment::Trim;
         $o_trim = Bio::Tools::Alignment::Trim-&gt;new();
         $o_trim-&gt;set_reverse_designator("R");
         $o_trim-&gt;set_forward_designator("F");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a specialized module designed by Chad for Chad to trim sequences based on a highly specialized
       list of requirements. In other words, write something that will trim sequences 'just like the people in
       the lab would do manually'.

       I settled on a sliding-window-average style of search which is ugly and slow but does _exactly_ what I
       want it to do.

       Mental note: rewrite this.

       It is very important to keep in mind the context in which this module was written: strictly to support
       the projects for which Consed.pm was designed.

       The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods.  Internal methods are usually preceded
       with a _

   <b>new()</b>
        Title   : new()
        Usage   : $o_trim = Bio::Tools::Alignment::Trim-&gt;new();
        Function: Construct the Bio::Tools::Alignment::Trim object. No parameters
                  are required to create this object. It is strictly a bundle of
                  functions, as far as I am concerned.
        Returns : A reference to a Bio::Tools::Alignment::Trim object.
        Args    : (optional)
                  -windowsize (default 10)
                  -phreds (default 20)

   <b>set_designators($forward_designator,$reverse_designator)</b>
        Title   : set_designators(&lt;forward&gt;,&lt;reverse&gt;)

        Function: Set the string by which the system determines whether a given
               sequence represents a forward or a reverse read.
        Returns : Nothing.
        Args    : two scalars: one representing the forward designator and one
               representing the reverse designator

   <b>set_forward_designator($designator)</b>
        Title   : set_forward_designator($designator)
        Usage   : $o_trim-&gt;set_forward_designator("F")
        Function: Set the string by which the system determines if a given
               sequence is a forward read.
        Returns : Nothing.
        Args    : A string representing the forward designator of this project.

   <b>set_reverse_designator($reverse_designator)</b>
        Title   : set_reverse_designator($reverse_designator)
        Function: Set the string by which the system determines if a given
               sequence is a reverse read.
        Usage   : $o_trim-&gt;set_reverse_designator("R")
        Returns : Nothing.
        Args    : A string representing the forward designator of this project.

   <b>get_designators()</b>
        Title   : get_designators()
        Usage   : $o_trim-&gt;get_designators()
        Returns : A string describing the current designators.
        Args    : None
        Notes   : Really for informational purposes only. Duh.

   <b>trim_leading_polys()</b>
        Title   : trim_leading_polys()
        Usage   : $o_trim-&gt;trim_leading_polys()
        Function: Not implemented. Does nothing.
        Returns : Nothing.
        Args    : None.
        Notes   : This function is not implemented. Part of something I wanted to
               do but never got around to doing.

   <b>dump_hash()</b>
        Title   : dump_hash()
        Usage   : $o_trim-&gt;dump_hash()
        Function: Unimplemented.
        Returns : Nothing.
        Args    : None.
        Notes   : Does nothing.

   <b>trim_singlet($sequence,$quality,$name,$class)</b>
        Title   : trim_singlet($sequence,$quality,$name,$class)
        Usage   : ($r_trim_points,$trimmed_sequence) =
               @{$o_trim-&gt;trim_singlet($sequence,$quality,$name,$class)};
        Function: Trim a singlet based on its quality.
        Returns : a reference to an array containing the forward and reverse
               trim points and the trimmed sequence.
        Args    : $sequence : A sequence (SCALAR, please)
                  $quality : A _scalar_ of space-delimited quality values.
                  $name : the name of the sequence
                  $class : The class of the sequence. One of qw(singlet
                       singleton doublet pair multiplet)
        Notes   : At the time this was written the bioperl objects SeqWithQuality
               and PrimaryQual did not exist. This is what is with the clumsy
               passing of references and so on. I will rewrite this next time I
               have to work with it. I also wasn't sure whether this function
               should return just the trim points or the points and the sequence.
               I decided that I always wanted both so that's how I implemented
               it.
            - Note that the size of the sliding windows is set during construction of
              the Bio::Tools::Alignment::Trim object.

   <b>trim_doublet($sequence,$quality,$name,$class)</b>
        Title   : trim_doublet($sequence,$quality,$name,$class)

        Function: Trim a singlet based on its quality.
        Returns : a reference to an array containing the forward and reverse
        Args    : $sequence : A sequence
                  $quality : A _scalar_ of space-delimited quality values.
                  $name : the name of the sequence
                  $class : The class of the sequence. One of qw(singlet
                       singleton doublet pair multiplet)
        Notes   : At the time this was written the bioperl objects SeqWithQuality
               and PrimaryQual did not exist. This is what is with the clumsy
               passing of references and so on. I will rewrite this next time I

        Returns : a scalar representing the start of the sequence
        Args    :
               $r_quals : A reference to an array containing quality values. In
                       context, this array of values has been smoothed by then
                       sliding window-look ahead algorithm.
               $windowsize : The size of the window used when the sliding window
                       look-ahead average was calculated.
               $phreds : &lt;fill in what this does here&gt;

        Notes   : Again, this should be rewritten to use PrimaryQual objects.
               A more detailed explanation of why phrap puts these zeros here should
               be written and placed here. Please email and hassle the author.

        Notes   : This was written before PrimaryQual objects existed. They
                  should use that object but I haven't rewritten this yet.
