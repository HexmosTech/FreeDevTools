</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Number::Phone::NANP - NANP-specific methods for Number::Phone

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a base class which encapsulates that information about phone numbers in the North American
       Numbering Plan (NANP) which are common to all NANP countries - that is, those whose international
       dialling code is +1.

       Country-specific modules should inherit from this module and provide their own versions of methods as
       necessary.  However, they should not provide an "is_valid" method or a constructor.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This module should not be used directly. It will be loaded as necessary by Number::Phone:

           use Number::Phone;

           my $phone_number = Number::Phone-&gt;new('+1 202 418 1440');
           # $phone_number is now a Number::Phone::NANP::US

           my $other_phone_number = Number::Phone-&gt;new('+1 866 623 2282');
           # $phone_number is non-geographic so is a Number::Phone::NANP

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods from Number::Phone are overridden:

       new The  constructor,  you  should  never  have  to call this yourself. To create an object the canonical
           incantation is "Number::Phone-"new('+1 ...')&gt;.

       operator
           For some countries operator data is available.

       data_source
           Returns a string telling where and when the data for operators was last  updated,  looking  something
           like:

               "localcallingguide.com at Wed Sep 30 10:37:39 2020 UTC"

           The current value of this is also documented in Number::Phone::Data.

       is_valid
           The  number  is  valid within the numbering scheme.  It may or may not yet be allocated, or it may be
           reserved.

       is_geographic
           NANP-globals like 1-800 aren't geographic, the rest are.

           As a special case, 1-600 is non-geographic. So too will be 1-622/633/644/655/677/688 when  they  come
           in to service.

       is_mobile
           NANP-globals  like  1-800  aren't  mobile.  For most others we just don't know because the data isn't
           published. libphonenumber has data for *some* countries, so we use that if we can.

       is_fixed_line
           NANP-globals are fixed lines, for the rest we generally  don't  know  with  some  exceptions  as  per
           is_mobile above.

       is_drama
           The  number  is  a  '555' number. Numbers with the D, E, and F digits set to 555 are not allocated to
           real customers, and are intended for use in fiction. eg 212 555 2368 for Ghostbusters.

           NB, despite Ghostbusters above, only 555-0100 to 555-0199 are actually reserved.

       is_government
           Area code 710 is reserved for the US Feds, but apparently only one number  in  the  whole  area  code
           works.

       is_tollfree
           The number is free to the caller. 800, 833, 844, 855, 866, 877 and 888 "area codes"

       is_specialrate
           The number is charged at a higher rate than normal. The 900 "area code" and some parts of 242 and 246
           (Bahamas and Barbados).

       is_personal
           The number is a "personal" number. The 500, 533, 544, 566 and 577 "area codes".

       country_code
           Returns 1.

       regulator
           Returns  informational text relevant to the whole NANP.  Note that when this method is inherited by a
           subclass it returns undef meaning "not known", but returns information about the NANPA when called on
           an object of class Number::Phone::NANP.

       areacode
           Return the area code for the number.

       areaname
           Return the name for the area code, if applicable, otherwise  returns  undef.   For  instance,  for  a
           number beginning with +1 201 200 it would return "Jersey City, NJ".

       subscriber
           Return the subscriber part of the number.

       format
           Return a sanely formatted version of the number, complete with IDD code.
