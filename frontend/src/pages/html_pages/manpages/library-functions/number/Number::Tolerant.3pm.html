</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Number::Tolerant - tolerance ranges for inexact numbers

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.710

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Number::Tolerant;

        my $range  = tolerance(10 =&gt; to =&gt; 12);
        my $random = 10 + <a href="../man2/rand.2.html">rand</a>(2);

        die "I shouldn't die" unless $random == $range;

        print "This line will always print.\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Number::Tolerant creates a number-like object whose value refers to a range of possible values, each
       equally acceptable.  It overloads comparison operations to reflect this.

       I use this module to simplify the comparison of measurement results to specified tolerances.

        reject $product unless $measurement == $specification;

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Instantiation</b>
       <u>new</u>

       <u>tolerance</u>

       There is a "new" method on the Number::Tolerant class, but it also exports a simple function,
       "tolerance", which will return an object of the Number::Tolerant class.  Both use the same syntax:

        my $range = Number::Tolerant-&gt;new( $x =&gt; $method =&gt; $y);

        my $range = tolerance( $x =&gt; $method =&gt; $y);

       The meaning of $x and $y are dependent on the value of $method, which describes the nature of the
       tolerance.  Tolerances can be defined in five ways, at present:

         method              range
        -------------------+------------------
         plus_or_minus     | x +/- y
         plus_or_minus_pct | x +/- (y% of x)
         or_more           | x to Inf
         or_less           | x to -Inf
         more_than         | x to Inf, not x
         less_than         | x to -Inf, not x
         to                | x to y
         infinite          | -Inf to Inf
         offset            | (x + y1) to (x + y2)

       For "or_less" and "or_more", $y is ignored if passed.  For "infinite", neither $x nor $y is used;
       "infinite" should be the sole argument.  The first two arguments can be reversed for "more_than" and
       "less_than", to be more English-like.

       Offset tolerances are slightly unusual.  Here is an example:

         my $offset_tolerance = tolerance(10 =&gt; offset =&gt; (-3, 5));
         # stringifies to: 10 (-3 +5)

       An offset is very much like a "plus_or_minus" tolerance, but its center value is not necessarily the
       midpoint between its extremes.  This is significant for comparisons and numifications of the tolerance.
       Given the following two tolerances:

         my $pm_dice = tolerance(10.5 =&gt; plus_or_minus =&gt; 7.5);
         my $os_dice = tolerance(11 =&gt; offset =&gt; (-8, 7));

       The first will sort as numerically less than the second.

       If the given arguments can't be formed into a tolerance, an exception will be raised.

       <u>from_string</u>

       A new tolerance can be instantiated from the stringification of an old tolerance.  For example:

        my $range = Number::Tolerant-&gt;from_string("10 to 12");

        die "Everything's OK!" if 11 == $range; # program dies of joy

       This will <u>not</u> yet parse stringified unions, but that will be implemented in the future.  (I just don't
       need it yet.)

       If a string can't be parsed, an exception is raised.

   <b>stringify_as</b>
         my $string = $tolerance-&gt;stringify_as($type);

       This method does nothing!  Someday, it will stringify the given tolerance as a different type, if
       possible.  "10 +/- 1" will "stringify_as('plus_or_minus_pct')" to "10 +/- 10%" for example.

   <b>numify</b>
         my $n = $tolerance-&gt;numify;

       This returns the numeric form of a tolerance.  If a tolerance has both a minimum and a maximum, and they
       are the same, then that is the numification.  Otherwise, numify returns undef.

   <b>Overloading</b>
       Tolerances overload a few operations, mostly comparisons.

       boolean
           Tolerances are always true.

       numify
           Most tolerances numify to undef; see "numify".

       stringify
           A tolerance stringifies to a short description of itself, generally something like "m &lt; x &lt; n"

            infinite  - "any number"
            to        - "m &lt;= x &lt;= n"
            or_more   - "m &lt;= x"
            or_less   - "x &lt;= n"
            more_than - "m &lt; x"
            less_than - "x &lt; n"
            offset    - "x (-y1 +y2)"
            constant  - "x"
            plus_or_minus     - "x +/- y"
            plus_or_minus_pct - "x +/- y%"

       equality
           A number is equal to a tolerance if it is neither less than nor greater than it.  (See below).

       smart match
           Same as equality.

       comparison
           A number is greater than a tolerance if it is greater than its maximum value.

           A number is less than a tolerance if it is less than its minimum value.

           No number is greater than an "or_more" tolerance or less than an "or_less" tolerance.

           "...or  equal  to"  comparisons  include the min/max values in the permissible range, as common sense
           suggests.

       tolerance intersection
           A tolerance "&amp;" a tolerance or number is the intersection of the two ranges.  Intersections allow you
           to quickly narrow down a set of tolerances to the most stringent intersection of values.

            tolerance(5 =&gt; to =&gt; 6) &amp; tolerance(5.5 =&gt; to =&gt; 6.5);
            # this yields: tolerance(5.5 =&gt; to =&gt; 6)

           If the given values have no intersection, "()" is returned.

           An intersection with a normal number will yield that number, if it is within the tolerance.

       tolerance union
           A tolerance "|" a tolerance or number is the union of the two.   Unions  allow  multiple  tolerances,
           whether  they  intersect  or  not,  to  be  treated  as  one.   See  Number::Tolerant::Union for more
           information.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDING</b></h4><pre>
       This feature is slighly experimental, but it's here.

       New tolerance types may be written as  subclasses  of  Number::Tolerant::Type,  providing  the  interface
       described in its documentation.  They can then be enabled or disabled with the following methods:

   <b>"</b> <b>enable_plugin</b> <b>"</b>
         Number::Tolerant-&gt;enable_plugin($class_name);

       This  method  enables  the named class, so that attempts to create new tolerances will check against this
       class.  Classes are checked against "validate_plugin" before being enabled.  An exception  is  thrown  if
       the class does not appear to provide the Number::Tolerant::Type interface.

   <b>"</b> <b>disable_plugin</b> <b>"</b>
         Number::Tolerant-&gt;disable_plugin($class_name);

       This method will disable the named class, so that future attempts to create new tolerances will not check
       against this class.

   <b>"</b> <b>validate_plugin</b> <b>"</b>
         Number::Tolerant-&gt;validate_plugin($class_name);

       This   method   checks   (naively)   that   the   given   class   provides   the   interface  defined  in
       Number::Tolerant::Type.  If it does not, an exception is thrown.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       •   Extend "from_string" to cover unions.

       •   Extend "from_string" to include Number::Range-type specifications.

       •   Allow translation into forms not originally used:

            my $range    = tolerance(9 =&gt; to =&gt; 17);
            my $range_pm = $range-&gt;convert_to('plus_minus');
            $range-&gt;stringify_as('plus_minus_pct');

       •   Create a factory so that you can simultaneously work with two sets of plugins.

           This  one  is  very  near  completion.   There  will  now  be  two  classes  that  should  be   used:
           Number::Tolerant::Factory,  which  produces  tolerances,  and Number::Tolerant::Tolerance, which is a
           tolerance.  Both will inherit from N::T, for supporting old code, and N::T will dispatch construction
           methods to a default factory.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The module Number::Range provides another way to deal with ranges of numbers.  The major differences are:
       N::R is set-like, not range-like; N::R does not overload any operators.  Number::Tolerant will not  (like
       N::R)  attempt  to parse a textual range specification like "1..2,5,7..10" unless specifically instructed
       to.  (The valid formats for strings passed to "from_string" does not match  Number::Range  exactly.   See
       TODO.)

       The "Number::Range" code:

        $range = Number::Range-&gt;new("10..15","20..25");

       Is equivalent to the "Number::Tolerant" code:

        $range = Number::Tolerant::Union-&gt;new(10..15,20..25);

       ...while the following code expresses an actual range:

        $range = tolerance(10 =&gt; to =&gt; 15) | tolerance(20 =&gt; to =&gt; 25);

</pre><h4><b>THANKS</b></h4><pre>
       Thanks to Yuval Kogman and #perl-qa for helping find the bizarre bug that drove the minimum required perl
       up to 5.8

       Thanks  to Tom Freedman, who reminded me that this code was fun to work on, and also provided the initial
       implementation for the offset type.
