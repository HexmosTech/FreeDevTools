</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       FBB::PrimeFactors - Performs the prime-number factorization of (BigInt) values

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;bobcat/primefactors&gt;</b>
       Linking option: <u>-lbobcat</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Integral  values  fall  into  two  categories:  prime numbers, whose only integral divisors are their own
       values and 1, and composite numbers, which also have at least one other (prime number) integral  divisor.
       All  composite  integral  values  can  be  factorized  as  the  product  of prime numbers. E.g., 6 can be
       factorized as 2 * 3; 8 can be factorized as 2 * 2 * 2. Finding these prime factors is  called  the  prime
       number  factorization, or `prime factorization’. When factorizing a value its prime factors may sometimes
       repeatedly be used as integral divisors: 8 is factorized as <u>pow(2,</u> <u>3)</u>, and 36 is factorized as

           36 = pow(2, 2) * pow(3, 2)

       The class <b>FBB::PrimeFactors</b> performs prime number factorizations of <u>FBB::BigInt</u> values. When  factorizing
       a  value  prime  numbers  up  to <u>sqrt(value)</u> must be available, as prime numbers up to <u>sqrt(value)</u> may be
       factors of <u>value</u>. Currently <u>PrimeFactors</u> uses the sieve of Eratosthenes to find these prime  numbers.  To
       find  the  next  prime  number  beyond  <u>lastPrime</u>,  the sieve of Eratosthenes must be used repeatedly for
       <u>lastPrime</u> <u>+=</u> <u>2</u> until <u>lastPrime</u> is prime. Once determined, prime numbers can of course be used directly to
       determine the next prime  number  or  to  factorize  an  integral  value.  To  accellerate  prime  number
       factorization  and  Eratosthenes’s  sieve  <b>PrimeFactors</b>  saves all its computed prime numbers in either a
       <u>std::vector</u> or in a file. Once determined, these prime numbers may again be  used  when  factorizing  the
       next integral value.

       After  factorizing an integral value its prime number factors and associated powers are made available in
       a vector  of  (<u>PrimeFactors::PrimePower</u>)  structs,  containing  the  value’s  sorted  prime  factors  and
       associated powers.

</pre><h4><b>NAMESPACE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FBB</b>
       All  constructors,  members,  operators  and manipulators, mentioned in this man-page, are defined in the
       namespace <b>FBB</b>.

</pre><h4><b>INHERITS</b> <b>FROM</b></h4><pre>
       -

</pre><h4><b>TYPEDEFS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENUMS</b></h4><pre>
       o      <b>struct</b> <b>PrimePower</b>:
              contains two fields:

                  struct PrimePower
                  {
                      BigInt prime;
                      size_t power;
                  };

              Here, <u>power</u> represents the number of times <u>prime</u> can be used as an integral divisor of  the  value
              that was factorized by <b>PrimeFactors</b>.

       o      <b>Factors</b>:
              is a synonym for <u>std::vector&lt;PrimePower</u>

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTORS</b></h4><pre>
       o      <b>PrimeFactors(BigIntVector</b> <b>&amp;primes)</b>:
              Prime numbers that were determined while factorizing values are collected in the <u>BigIntVector</u> that
              is passed as argument to this constructor.

              Initially  the  <u>BigIntVector</u>  passed  as  argument may be empty or may contain at least two primes
              (which must be, respectively, 2  and  3).  The  prime  numbers  in  <u>primes</u>  must  be  sorted.  The
              constructor does not verify whether the prime numbers are actually sorted, but if the <u>BigIntVector</u>
              contains  primes  it  <u>does</u>  check  whether  the  first  two  prime  numbers are indeed 2 and 3. An
              <u>FBB::Exception</u> is thrown if this condition is not met.

              While numbers are being factorized, new prime numbers may be added to <u>primes</u>, and  <u>primes</u>  can  be
              reused by othher <u>PrimeFactors</u> objects.

       o      <b>PrimeFactors(std::string</b> <b>const</b> <b>&amp;name</b> <b>=</b> <b>"<a href="file:~/.primes">~/.primes</a>",</b> <b>size_t</b> <b>blockSize</b> <b>=</b> <b>1000)</b>:
              Prime numbers that are determined while factorizing values are collected on a stream whose name is
              passed  as  argument  to this constructor. By default <u><a href="file:~/.primes">~/.primes</a></u> is used. If <u>name</u> starts with `<u>~/</u>’,
              then this string is replaced by the user’s home directory.

              Primes are read from the named stream in blocks of at most <u>blockSize</u>, and new primes  are  flushed
              to  this  stream  once  <u>blockSize</u>  new  primes have been generated or when the <b>PrimeFactors</b> object
              (i.e., the last <b>PrimeFactors</b> object sharing the stream) ceases to exist.

              If the stream does not yet exist it is created by <b>PrimeFactors</b>. The stream may either be empty, or
              it must contain sorted and white-space delimited prime numbers  (inserted  as  hexadecimal  <u>BigInt</u>
              values).  The  first  two primes on this file must be, respectively, 2 and 3. The constructor does
              not verify whether the prime numbers are actually sorted, but if the  stream  contains  primes  it
              <u>does</u>  check whether the first two prime numbers are indeed 2 and 3. An <u>FBB::Exception</u> is thrown if
              this condition is not met.

              While numbers are being factorized, new prime numbers may be added to the stream, and  the  stream
              can be reused by other <u>PrimeFactors</u> objects.

       Copy and move constructors (and assignment operators) are available.

       <b>FBB::PrimeFactor</b>  objects  created  using  the  copy constructor or receiving their values using the copy
       assignment operator share the prime numbers storage device (the <u>BigIntVector</u> or the stream containing the
       primes) with their source objects.

</pre><h4><b>MEMBER</b> <b>FUNCTION</b></h4><pre>
       o      <b>Factors</b> <b>const</b> <b>&amp;factorize(BigInt</b> <b>const</b> <b>&amp;value)</b>:
              The prime factors of <u>value</u> are determined and returned in the <u>PrimeFactors::Factors</u> vectors. While
              the prime factors of <u>value</u> are determined new prime numbers may be added to the <u>BigIntVector</u> or to
              the stream that is passed to the <b>PrimeFactors</b> object. The elements  of  <u>PrimeFactors::Factors</u>  are
              sorted  by  their  prime  numbers.  The  first  element contains the value’s smallest prime number
              factor.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;iostream&gt;
       #include &lt;bobcat/primefactors&gt;

       using namespace std;
       using namespace FBB;

       int main(int argc, char **argv)
       {
           PrimeFactors pf1("/tmp/primes");
           PrimeFactors::Factors const *factors = &amp;pf1.factorize(stoull(argv[1]));

           cout &lt;&lt; "Using /tmp/primes:\n";
           for (auto &amp;factor: *factors)
               cout &lt;&lt; factor.prime &lt;&lt; "**" &lt;&lt; factor.power &lt;&lt; ’ ’;

           vector&lt;BigInt&gt; primes;
           PrimeFactors pf2(primes);
           factors = &amp;pf2.factorize(stoull(argv[1]));

           cout &lt;&lt; "\n"
                   "Using BigIntVector:\n";
           for (auto &amp;factor: *factors)
               cout &lt;&lt; factor.prime &lt;&lt; "**" &lt;&lt; factor.power &lt;&lt; ’ ’;

           cout &lt;&lt; "\n"
                   "Collected primes: ";

           for (auto &amp;prime: primes)
               cout &lt;&lt; prime &lt;&lt; ’ ’;

           cout &lt;&lt; ’\n’;
       }

       If this program is run with argument 1950 it produces the following output:

           Using /tmp/primes:
           2**1 3**1 5**2 13**1
           Using BigIntVector:
           2**1 3**1 5**2 13**1
           Collected primes: 2 3 5 7 11 13
