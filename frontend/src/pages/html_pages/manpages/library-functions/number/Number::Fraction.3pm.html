</pre><h4><b>ABSTRACT</b></h4><pre>
       Number::Fraction is a Perl module which allows you to work with fractions in your Perl programs.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Number::Fraction allows you to work with fractions (i.e. rational numbers) in your Perl programs in a
       very natural way.

       It was originally written as a demonstration of the techniques of overloading.

       If you use the module in your program in the usual way

         use Number::Fraction;

       you can then create fraction objects using "Number::Fraction-"new&gt; in a number of ways.

         my $f1 = Number::Fraction-&gt;new(1, 2);

       creates a fraction with a numerator of 1 and a denominator of 2.

         my $fm = Number::Fraction-&gt;new(1, 2, 3);

       creates a fraction from an integer of 1, a numerator of 2 and a denominator of 3; which results in a
       fraction of 5/3 since fractions are normalised.

         my $f2 = Number::Fraction-&gt;new('1/2');

       does the same thing but from a string constant.

         my $f3 = Number::Fraction-&gt;new($f1);

       makes $f3 a copy of $f1

         my $f4 = Number::Fraction-&gt;new; # 0/1

       creates a fraction with a denominator of 0 and a numerator of 1.

       If you use the alternative syntax of

         use Number::Fraction ':constants';

       then Number::Fraction will automatically create fraction objects from string constants in your program.
       Any time your program contains a string constant of the form "\d+/\d+" then that will be automatically
       replaced with the equivalent fraction object. For example

         my $f1 = '1/2';

       Having created fraction objects you can manipulate them using most of the normal mathematical operations.

         my $one = $f1 + $f2;
         my $half = $one - $f1;

       Additionally, whenever a fraction object is evaluated in a string context, it will return a string in the
       format x/y. When a fraction object is evaluated in a numerical context, it will return a floating point
       representation of its value.

       Fraction objects will always "normalise" themselves. That is, if you create a fraction of '2/4', it will
       silently be converted to '1/2'.

   <b>Mixed</b> <b>Fractions</b> <b>and</b> <b>Unicode</b> <b>Support</b>
       Since version 3.0 the interpretation of strings and constants has been enriched with a few features for
       mixed fractions and Unicode characters.

       Number::Fraction now recognises a more Perlish way of entering mixed fractions which consist of an
       integer-part and a fraction in the form of "\d+_\d+/\d+". For example

         my $mixed = '2_3/4'; # two and three fourths, stored as 11/4

       or

         my $simple = '2½'; # two and a half, stored as 5/2

       Mixed fractions, either in Perl notation or with Unicode fractions can be negative, prepending it with a
       minus-sign.

         my $negative = '-⅛'; # minus one eighth

   <b>Experimental</b> <b>Support</b> <b>for</b> <b>Exponentiation</b>
       Version 1.13 of Number::Fraction adds experimental support for exponentiation operations. Version 3 has
       extended support and returns a Number::Fraction.

       It does a lot of cheating, but can give very useful results. And for now will try to make a real number
       into a Number::Fraction if that real does not have a power of ten component (like 1.234e45, thes numbers
       will simply fail). Such that

         ('5⅞' ** '1¼') ** '⅘'

       will produce still the right fraction!

       In a future version, I might use automatic rounding to a optional accuracy, so that it also works for
       less forced examples as the above. One could still use "nearest" to find the nearest fraction to the
       result of the previous computation.

       For example:

         '1/2' ** 2 #   Returns a Number::Fraction ('1/4')
         '2/1' ** '2/1' Returns a Number::Fraction ('4/1')
         '2/1' ** '1/2' Returns a real number (1.414213)
          0.5  ** '2/1' Returns a Number::Fraction ('1/4')
          0.25 ** '1/2' Returns a Number::Fraction ('1/2')

   <b>Version</b> <b>3:</b> <b>Now</b> <b>With</b> <b>Added</b> <b>Moo</b>
       Version 3 of Number::Fraction has been reimplemented using Moo. You should see very little difference in
       the way that the class works. The only difference I can see is that "new" used to return "undef" if it
       couldn't create a valid object from its arguments, it now dies. If you aren't sure of the values that are
       being passed into the constructor, then you'll want to call it within an "eval { ... }" block (or using
       something equivalent like Try::Tiny).

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>import</b>
       Called when module is "use"d. Use to optionally install constant handler.

   <b>unimport</b>
       Be a good citizen and uninstall constant handler when caller uses "no Number::Fraction".

   <b>BUILDARGS</b>
       Parameter massager for Number::Fraction object. Takes the following kinds of parameters:

       •   A single Number::Fraction object which is cloned.

       •   A  string  in  the form 'x/y' where x and y are integers. x is used as the numerator and y is used as
           the denominator of the new object.

           A string in the form 'a_b/c' where a,b and c are integers.  The numerator will  be  equal  to  a*c+b!
           and c is used as the denominator of the new object.

       •   Three integers which are used as the integer, numerator and denominator of the new object.

           In order for this to work in version 2.x, one needs to enable 'mixed' fractions:

             use Number::Fractions ':mixed';

           This  will  be  the  default behaviour in version 3.x; when not enabled in version 2.x it will omit a
           warning to revise your code.

       •   Two integers which are used as the numerator and denominator of the new object.

       •   A single integer which is used as the numerator of the the new object.  The denominator is set to 1.

       •   No arguments, in which case a numerator of 0 and a denominator of 1 are used.

       •   Note

           As of version 2.1 it no longer allows for an array of four or more integer.  Before  then,  it  would
           simply  pass  in  the first two integers. Version 2.1 allows for three integers (when using ":mixed")
           and issues a warning when more then two parameters are passed.  Starting with version 3, it will  die
           as it is seen as an error to pass invalid input.

       Dies if a Number::Fraction object can't be created.

   <b>BUILD</b>
       Object initialiser for Number::Fraction. Ensures that fractions are in a normalised format.

   <b>to_string</b>
       Returns a string representation of the fraction in the form "numerator/denominator".

   <b>to_mixed</b>
       Returns a string representation of the fraction in the form "integer numerator/denominator".

   <b>to_unicode_string</b>
       Returns  a  string  representation  of  the  fraction  in  the  form  "superscript  numerator / subscript
       denominator".  A Unicode 'FRACTION SLASH' is used instead of a normal slash.

   <b>to_unicode_mixed</b>
       Returns a string representation of the fraction in the form "integer superscript  numerator  /  subscript
       denominator".  A Unicode 'FRACTION SLASH' is used instead of a normal slash.

   <b>to_halfs</b>
   <b>to_quarters</b>
   <b>to_eighths</b>
   <b>to_thirds</b>
   <b>to_sixths</b>
   <b>to_fifths</b>
       Returns  a  string  representation as a mixed fraction, rounded to the nearest possible 'half', 'quarter'
       ... and so on.

   <b>to_simple</b>
       Returns a string representation as a mixed fraction, rounded to the nearest possible to any of the  above
       mentioned standard fractions. NB ⅐, ⅑ or ⅒ are not being used.

       Optionally,  one  can  pass  in  a  list  of  well-known  denominators (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8) to choose which
       fractions can be used.

   <b>to_num</b>
       Returns a numeric representation of the fraction by calculating  the  sum  numerator/denominator.  Normal
       caveats about the precision of floating point numbers apply.

   <b>add</b>
       Add a value to a fraction object and return a new object representing the result of the calculation.

       The  first  parameter  is  a fraction object. The second parameter is either another fraction object or a
       number.

   <b>mult</b>
       Multiply a fraction object by a value and return a new object representing the result of the calculation.

       The first parameter is a fraction object. The second parameter is either another  fraction  object  or  a
       number.

   <b>subtract</b>
       Subtract  a  value  from  a  fraction  object  and  return  a  new  object representing the result of the
       calculation.

       The first parameter is a fraction object. The second parameter is either another  fraction  object  or  a
       number.

   <b>div</b>
       Divide a fraction object by a value and return a new object representing the result of the calculation.

       The  first  parameter  is  a fraction object. The second parameter is either another fraction object or a
       number.

   <b>exp</b>
       Raise a Number::Fraction object to a power.

       The first argument is a number fraction object. The second argument is another Number::Fraction object or
       a number. It will try to compute another new Number::Fraction object. This may fail if  either  numerator
       or denominator of the new one are getting too big. In such case the value returned is a real number.

   <b>abs</b>
       Returns a copy of the given object with both the numerator and denominator changed to positive values.

   <b>fract</b>
       Returns the fraction part of a Number::Fraction object as a new Number::Fraction object.

   <b>int</b>
       Returns the integer part of a Number::Fraction object as a new Number::Fraction object.

   <b>nearest</b>
       Takes  a  list  of  integers  and  creates  a  new  Number::Fraction  object nearest to a fraction with a
       deniminator from that list.
