</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_GetAudioStreamQueued - Get the number of bytes currently queued.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;SDL3/SDL_audio.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>SDL_GetAudioStreamQueued(SDL_AudioStream</b> <b>*stream);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  the number of bytes put into a stream as input, not the number that can be retrieved as output.
       Because of several details, it's not possible to calculate one number directly from  the  other.  If  you
       need    to   know   how   much   usable   data   can   be   retrieved   right   now,   you   should   use
       <b>SDL_GetAudioStreamAvailable</b>() and not this function.

       Note that audio streams can change their input format at any time, even if there is still data queued  in
       a  different  format, so the returned byte count will not necessarily match the number of _sample frames_
       available. Users of this API should be aware of format changes they make when feeding a stream  and  plan
       accordingly.

       Queued  data  is  not  converted  until it is consumed by <b>SDL_GetAudioStreamData</b>, so this value should be
       representative of the exact data that was put into the stream.

       If the stream has so much data that it would overflow an int, the return value is clamped  to  a  maximum
       value, but no queued data is lost; if there are gigabytes of data queued, the app might need to read some
       of it with <b>SDL_GetAudioStreamData</b> before this function's return value is no longer clamped.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>stream</u> the audio stream to query.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       for more information.

</pre><h4><b>THREAD</b> <b>SAFETY</b></h4><pre>
       It is safe to call this function from any thread.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
