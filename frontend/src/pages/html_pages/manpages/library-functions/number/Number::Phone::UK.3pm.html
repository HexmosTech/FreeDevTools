</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Number::Phone::UK - UK-specific methods for Number::Phone

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Number::Phone;

           $daves_phone = Number::Phone-&gt;new('+44 1234 567890');

</pre><h4><b>DATABASE</b></h4><pre>
       Number::Phone::UK uses a large database, access via Number::Phone::UK::Data. This database lives in a
       file, and normally only the little bits of it that you access will ever get loaded into memory. This
       means, however, that creating Number::Phone::UK objects almost always involves disk access and so is slow
       compared to data for some other countries. There are two ways to avoid this slowness.

       First, if you don't need all the functionality you can use Number::Phone::Lib.

       Second, if you can accept slow startup - eg when your server starts - then you can call
       "Number::Phone::UK::Data-&gt;slurp()" from your code, which will pull the entire database into memory. This
       will take a few minutes, and on a 64-bit machine will consume of the order of 200MB of memory.

       The database uses Data::CompactReadonly. This may have some problems if you connect to it, fork(), and
       then try to access the database from multiple processes. We attempt to work around this by re-connecting
       to the database after forking. This is, of course, not a problem if you slurp() the database before
       forking.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods from Number::Phone are overridden:

       new The  constructor,  you  should  never  have  to call this yourself. To create an object the canonical
           incantation is "Number::Phone-&gt;new('+44 ...')".

       data_source
           Returns a string telling where and when the data that drives this class  was  last  updated,  looking
           something like:

               "OFCOM at Wed Sep 30 10:37:39 2020 UTC"

           The current value of this is also documented in Number::Phone::Data.

       is_valid
           The  number is valid within the national numbering scheme.  It may or may not yet be allocated, or it
           may be reserved.  Any number which returns true for any of the following methods will also be valid.

       is_allocated
           The number has been allocated to a telco for use.  It may or  may  not  yet  be  in  use  or  may  be
           reserved.

       is_drama
           The  number  is  intended  for  use  in  fiction.  OFCOM has allocated numerous small ranges for this
           purpose.    These    numbers    will    not    be    allocated    to     real     customers.      See
           &lt;<a href="http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/numbering/guidance-tele-no/numbers-for-drama">http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/numbering/guidance-tele-no/numbers-for-drama</a>&gt;    for   the
           authoritative source.

       is_geographic
           The number refers to a geographic area.

       is_fixed_line
           The number, when in use, can only refer to a fixed line.

           (we can't tell whether a number is a fixed line, but we can tell that some are *not*).

       is_mobile
           The number, when in use, can only refer to a mobile phone.

       is_pager
           The number, when in use, can only refer to a pager.

       is_tollfree
           Callers will not be charged for calls to this number under normal circumstances.

       is_specialrate
           The number, when in use, attracts special rates.  For instance, national dialling at local rates,  or
           premium rates for services.

       is_adult
           The number, when in use, goes to a service of an adult nature, such as porn.

       is_personal
           The number, when in use, goes to an individual person.

       is_corporate
           The number, when in use, goes to a business.

       is_ipphone
           The number, when in use, is terminated using VoIP.

       is_network_service
           The  number  is some kind of network service such as a human operator, directory enquiries, emergency
           services etc

       country_code
           Returns 44.

       regulator
           Returns informational text.

       areacode
           Return the area code - if applicable - for the number.  If not applicable, returns undef.

       areaname
           Return the area name - if applicable - for the number, or undef.

       location
           For geographic numbers, this returns the location of the exchange to which that number  is  assigned,
           if available.  Otherwise returns undef.

       subscriber
           Return the subscriber part of the number

       operator
           Return the name of the telco operating this number, in an appropriate character set and with optional
           details such as their web site or phone number.

       format
           Return  a sanely formatted version of the number, complete with IDD code, eg for the UK number (0208)
           771-2924 it would return +44 20 8771 2924.

       intra_country_dial_to
           Within the UK numbering plan you can *always* dial 0xxxx xxxxxx  for  intra-country  calls.  In  most
           places   the   leading   0$areacode   is   optional   but   in   some   it   is   required   (see  eg
           &lt;https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/19160/aberdeen_local_dialling_release.pdf&gt;) and
           over time this will apply to more areas.

       country
           If the number is_international, return the two-letter ISO country code.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS/BUGS/FEEDBACK</b></h4><pre>
       The results are only as up-to-date as the data included from OFCOM's  official  documentation  of  number
       range allocations.

       No attempt is made to deal with number portability.

       Please   report   bugs  at  &lt;https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues&gt;,  including,  if
       possible, a test case.

       I welcome feedback from users.
