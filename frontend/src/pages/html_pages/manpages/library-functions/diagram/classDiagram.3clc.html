       Class_diagram - OpenCL UML Class Diagram

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The diagram above represents the OpenCL specification as a class diagram using the Unified Modeling
       Language* (UML) notation. The diagram shows both nodes and edges which are classes and their
       relationships. As a simplification it shows only classes, and no attributes or operations. As for
       relationships it shows aggregations (annotated with a solid diamond), associations (no annotation), and
       inheritance (annotated with an open arrowhead). The cardinality of a relationship is shown on each end of
       it. A cardinality of "*" represents "many", a cardinality of "1" represents "one and only one" and a
       cardinality of "0:1" represents "optionally one". The navigability of a relationship is shown using a
       regular arrowhead.
