</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Welcome  to  <b>diagram</b>,  a  package  for  the easy construction of diagrams (sic), i.e. 2D vector graphics,
       sometimes also called <u>pictures</u>.  Note that this package is not a replacement for <b>Tk</b>'s canvas, but  rather
       a  layer  sitting  on  top of it, to make it easier to use.  In other words, using the canvas as the core
       graphics engine <b>diagram</b> abstracts away from the minutiae of handling coordinates to position and size the
       drawn elements, allowing the user to concentrate on the content of the diagram instead.

       This is similar to Brian Kernighan's PIC language for troff, which is  the  spiritual  ancestor  of  this
       package.

       This  document  contains  the reference to the API and drawing (language) commands. Its intended audience
       are users of the package wishing to refresh their memory.  Newcomers should  read  the  <u>Diagram</u>  <u>Language</u>
       <u>Tutorial</u>  first.   Developers wishing to work on the internals of the package and its supporting packages
       should look at section <b>Diagram</b> <b>Classes</b> first, and then the  comments  in  the  sources  of  the  packages
       itself.

       In  the  remainder  of  the  document  we first describe the APIs of the diagram class and its instances,
       followed by the language reference for the drawing language itself.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CLASS</b> <b>API</b>
       The package exports the API described here.

       <b>::diagram</b> <u>objectName</u> <u>canvas</u> ?<u>script</u>?
              The command creates a new instance of a diagram controller and returns the fully qualified name of
              the object command as its result.  The new instance is connected to the specified  <u>canvas</u>  object,
              which is used as the diagrams graphics engine. This is usually an instance of Tk's canvas, however
              any object which is API compatible to Tk's canvas can be used here.

              The  API  of this object command is described in the following section, <b>Object</b> <b>API</b>. It may be used
              to invoke various operations on the object.

              If the <u>script</u> argument is specified then method <b>draw</b> will be invoked on it.

   <b>OBJECT</b> <b>API</b>
       Instances of the diagram class support the following methods:

       <u>diagramObject</u> <b>new</b> <b>direction</b> <u>name</u> ?<u>key</u> <u>value</u>...?
              This method defines a new named direction and its attributes. The  latter  is  given  through  the
              <u>key</u>/<u>value</u> pairs coming after the <u>name</u>.

              Users  are  mostly  free  to  specify  arbitrary attributes with whatever meaning they desire. The
              exception are the names <u>angle</u> and <u>opposite</u>. They are special to the diagram  package  and  have  a
              fixed meaning.

              angle  This attribute specifies the angle of the direction in degrees, where 0 points east (to the
                     right) and 90 points north (up).

              opposite
                     This  attribute  specifies  the  name  of  the  direction  which  should  be  considered as
                     complementary to the named one.

       <u>diagramObject</u> <b>new</b> <b>element</b> <u>name</u> <u>attributes</u> <u>cmdprefix</u>
              This method defines a new graphics element for the drawing language. I.e. <u>name</u> will become  a  new
              command  in  the  language, and the specified command prefix (<u>cmdprefix</u>) will be called to perform
              the actual drawing.

              <u>attributes</u> specifies the set of attributes for which data has to be  available.  I.e.  the  system
              will  run  the  ...-callbacks  for  these  attributes.   See  the  method  <b>new</b>  <b>attribute</b> for more
              information on attribute definitions.

              The command prefix is expected to conform to the following signature:

              <b>cmdprefix</b> <u>canvas</u> <u>attributes</u>
                     Where <u>canvas</u> is the handle of the canvas widget to draw to, and <u>attributes</u> is a  dictionary
                     holding the attributes for the element, be they user-specified, or defaults.

                     The results of the command has to be a list containing at least two and at most four items.
                     These are, in order:

                     [1]    The list of canvas items the drawn element consists of.

                     [2]    The dictionary of named locations in the element, its <u>corners</u>.

                     [3]    An  optional mode, either "relative" or "absolute".  When not returned "relative" is
                            assumed. In the case of a relative element position the attributes "with"  and  "at"
                            are used to determine the final position of the new element.

                     [4]    An  optional  name  of  a  direction.  If not the empty string this is handed to the
                            automatic layouter as the new direction to follow.

       <u>diagramObject</u> <b>new</b> <b>alias</b> <u>name</u> <u>cmdprefix</u>
              This method defines a new command for the drawing language. I.e. <u>name</u> will become a new command in
              the language, and the specified command prefix (<u>cmdprefix</u>) will be  called  on  use  of  this  new
              command.  Any  arguments  given  to the command are simply passed to the prefix. There is no fixed
              siganture.

              Note that the prefix is run in the context of the drawing language, allowing the direct use of any
              existing commands.

       <u>diagramObject</u> <b>new</b> <b>command</b> <u>name</u> <u>arguments</u> <u>body</u>
              This is like <b>new</b> <b>alias</b> except that the new command is defined as a  procedure  in  the  language's
              context, with regular argument list and body.

       <u>diagramObject</u> <b>new</b> <b>attribute</b> <u>name</u> ?<u>key</u> <u>value</u>...?
              This method defines a new named attribute which can be used by graphical elements. The handling of
              the attribute by the processor is declared through the <u>key</u>/<u>value</u> pairs coming after the <u>name</u>.

              The accepted keys and their meanings are:

              <b>key</b>    The  value  of  this  key is the name of the key under which the attribute's value shall be
                     stored in the attribute dictionary given to the drawing command after attribute  processing
                     is complete.

                     This key is optional. If it is not specified it defaults to the name of the attribute.

              <b>get</b>    The value of this key is a command prefix which will be invoked to retrieve the attribute's
                     argument(s) from the command line.

                     This  key is optional. If it is not specified a default is used which takes the single word
                     after the attribute name as the attribute's value.

                     The signature of the command prefix is

                     <b>cmdprefix</b> <u>wordqueue</u>
                            Where <u>wordqueue</u> is the handle of a queue object conforming to the API of the  queues
                            provided by package <b>struct::queue</b>. This queue contains the not-yet-processed part of
                            the  attribute  definitions,  with one entry per word, with the first entry the word
                            <u>after</u> name of the attribute. In other words, the attribute's name has  already  been
                            removed from the queue.

                            The  result  of the command is the value of the attribute, which may have been taken
                            from the queue, or not.

              <b>transform</b>
                     The value of this key is a command prefix which will be invoked to transform the  retrieved
                     value (See <b>get</b>) into their final form.

                     This  key  is optional. If it is not specified no transformation is done.  The signature of
                     the command prefix is

                     <b>cmdprefix</b> <u>value</u>
                            Where <u>value</u> is the value to transform.

                            The result of the command is the final value of the attribute.

              <b>type</b>   The value of this key is a command prefix which will be invoked to validate the attribute's
                     argument(s).

                     This key is optional. If it is not specified no validation is done.

                     The signature of the command prefix is that of snit validation types. See the documentation
                     of the <b>snit</b> package.

              <b>merge</b>  The value of this key is a command prefix which will be invoked to insert  the  transformed
                     and validated attribute value into the dictionary of collected attributes.

                     This  key  is optional. If it is not specified a default merge is chosen, based on the data
                     for key <b>aggregate</b>, see below.  The signature of the command prefix is

                     <b>cmdprefix</b> <u>value</u> <u>dict</u>
                            Where <u>value</u> is the value to insert, and <u>dict</u> the dictionary of attributes and values
                            collected so far.

                            The result of the command is the new dictionary of attributes.

              <b>aggregate</b>
                     The value of this key is a boolean flag. It has an effect if and only if the key <b>merge</b>  was
                     not specified. This key is optional. If it is not specified it defaults to <b>False</b>.

                     If  the  key  is effective, the value of <b>False</b> means that the attribute's value is <u>set</u> into
                     the dictionary using the value of key <u>key</u> (see above) as index, <u>overwriting</u> any  previously
                     specified value.

                     If the key is effective, the value of <b>True</b> means that the attribute's value is <u>added</u> to the
                     dictionary  using  the  value  of  key  <u>key</u>  (see above) as index, <u>extending</u> any previously
                     specified value.  This means that the final value of the attribute as seen after processing
                     will be a list of the collected values.

              <b>default</b>
                     The value of this key is a command  prefix  which  will  be  invoked  after  collection  of
                     attributes  has been completed and this attribute is in the list of required attributes for
                     the drawing element (See argument <u>attributes</u> of method <b>new</b> <b>element</b>).

                     Note that the connection is made through the value of key <u>key</u>, not  through  the  attribute
                     name per se.

                     Further  note  that this command prefix is invoked even if a user specified attribute value
                     is present. This allows the command to go beyond simply setting defaults, it can  calculate
                     and store derived values as well.

                     This  key  is optional. If an element requires this attribute, but <u>default</u> is not specified
                     then nothing will be done.

                     The signature of the command prefix is

                     <b>cmdprefix</b> <b>init</b>
                            This method is  run  when  the  attribute  is  defined,  its  responsibility  is  to
                            initialize  anything  in  the  language  namespace  for  the  attribute  and default
                            processing.

                            The result of this method is ignored.

                     <b>cmdprefix</b> <b>fill</b> <u>varname</u>
                            This method is run to put defaults, or derived values into the attribute  dictionary
                            named by <u>varname</u>. This variable will be found in the calling context.

                            The result of this method is ignored.

                     <b>cmdprefix</b> <b>set</b> <u>name</u> <u>value</u>
                            This method is run to push current a attribute value into the language namespace, to
                            make it the new default.

                            The result of this method is ignored.

              <b>linked</b> This key is effective if and only if key <b>default</b> is not specified. In that case is supplies
                     a  default  handling  for  <b>default</b>,  linking  the  attribute  to a variable in the language
                     context.

                     The value for this key is a 2-element list containing the name of the variable to link  to,
                     and its initial value, in this order.

       <u>diagramObject</u> <b>unknown</b> <b>attribute</b> <u>cmdprefix</u>
              This  method registers the command prefix with the subsystem processing the attributes for element
              commands, telling it to call it when it encounters an attribute it is unable to handle on its on.

              It is allowed to register more than callback, these will be called in order of registration  (i.e.
              first  to  last),  until  one  of  the callbacks accepts the current input.  The command prefix is
              expected to conform to the following signature:

              <b>cmdprefix</b> <u>wordqueue</u>
                     Where <u>wordqueue</u> is the handle of a queue  object  conforming  to  the  API  of  the  queues
                     provided  by  package <b>struct::queue</b>.  This queue contains the not-yet-processed part of the
                     attribute definitions, with one entry per word, with  the  first  entry  the  name  of  the
                     attribute which could not be processed.

                     The  results of the command has to be a boolean value where <b>True</b> signals that this callback
                     has accepted the attribute, processed it, and the new state of the <u>wordqueue</u> is  where  the
                     general processing shall continue.

                     Given  the  signature  the  command  has  basically  two  ways  of handling (rewriting) the
                     attributes it recognizes:

                     [1]    Replace the attribute (and arguments) with a different attribute and arguments.

                     [2]    Push additional words in front to get the general processing unstuck.

       <u>diagramObject</u> <b>draw</b> <u>script</u>
              This method runs the given <u>script</u> in the context of the drawing language definitions.  See section
              <b>Language</b> <b>Reference</b> for details on the available commands.

              <u>Note</u> that <u>script</u> is <u>trusted</u>.  It is executed in the current interpreter with access  to  its  full
              abilities.  For the execution of untrusted diagram scripts this interpreter should be a safe one.

   <b>ELEMENTS</b>
       This  section  lists the commands for the predefined drawing elements, aka shapes. These commands are all
       defined in the language's context.  All commands of this section return the handle of the  newly  created
       element  as their result. This handle also exists as a command which can be used to query the element for
       its corners (names, values).  See section <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Commands</b>.  IMAGE: figure-02-basic-shapes

       <b>arc</b> <u>attr</u>...
              IMAGE: figure-02-arc An open element with the corresponding  corners,  i.e.  "start",  "end",  and
              "center".   Note however that it also has the compass rose of closed elements as its corners, with
              the center of the arc's circle as the center of the compass and the other points on the circle the
              arc is part of.  It handles the attributes

              <b>anchor</b> <u>name</u>

                     the element's center, by name. I.e. this attribute defines the text's position relative  to
                     the  element's  center.  The value is ignored if no text was specified for the element.  If
                     not specified the system falls back to the value taken from the language  variable  <b>anchor</b>,
                     which  itself  defaults to <b>center</b>.  The legal values are all those accepted by <u>Tk_GetAnchor</u>

              <b>radius</b> <u>length</u>
                     Specifies the radius of the <b>arc</b> element, or rather, the radius of the circle the shown  arc

                            Draw a dash-dot-dotted line.

                     Note that the values "solid", "dot(ted)", "dash(ed)", "dash-dot",  and  "dash-dot-dot"  are
                     all accepted as shorthands for the <b>style</b> command using them as argument.

              <b>text</b> <u>string</u>
                     Specifies  the  text  to  associate with the element.  Defaults to nothing.  When specified
                     multiple times the actually shown text is the  concatenation  of  the  individual  strings,
                     vertically stacked, with the first string specified being the topmost element.

              <b>textcolor</b> <u>spec</u>
                     Specifies the color used to draw the text of an element with.  Ignored if there is no text.
                     If  not  specified  the  system  falls  back  to the value taken from the language variable

                     <b>textfont</b>, which itself defaults to <b>Helvetica</b> <b>12pt</b>.

              <b>to</b> <u>location</u>
                     Specifies the location where the <b>arc</b> element ends.  Defaults to  a  location  such  that  a
                     90-degree arc is drawn in the chosen direction, starting at <b>from</b>.

       <b>arrow</b> <u>attr</u>...

       <b>--&gt;</b> <u>attr</u>...

       <b>&lt;--&gt;</b> <u>attr</u>...

       <b>&lt;--&gt;</b> <u>attr</u>...
              IMAGE:  figure-02-arrow  An  alias  for the <b>line</b> element (see below), with the attribute <b>arrowhead</b>
              preset to <b>-&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;-&gt;</b>, or <b>&lt;-</b>.  The <b>arrow</b> is equivalent to <b>--&gt;</b>.

       <b>block</b> <u>script</u> <u>attr</u>...
              A closed element with the corresponding corners, i.e. the eight directions of  the  compass  rose,
              and  "center".  The main effect is the aggregration of all elements created by the <u>script</u> into one
              element.  This also means that while the elements created by the script are visible in the element
              history while the script is executing, afterward the history contains only the block  itself,  and
              not the elements it is composed of.

              The  script has access to the current state of all variables in the language context.  Any changes
              to the variables will be reverted after execution of the block.  However, also, any variables  set
              in the script will be exported as corners of the element, allowing users to define their own named
              locations in the block.

              Regarding  the  layout  mechanism any changes made by the script are reverted after the element is
              done.  In other words, a block is an implicit <b>group</b>.

              Blocks handle all attributes, propgating their settings into the  script  as  the  default  values
              active during script execution.

       <b>box</b> <u>attr</u>...
              IMAGE: figure-02-box A closed element with the corresponding corners, i.e. the eight directions of
              the compass rose, and "center".  It handles the attributes

              <b>diam</b> <u>length</u>
                     Specifies  the diameter of the <b>circle</b> element, as an alternative way to specify its <b>radius</b>.
                     Effective if and only if the radius was not specified. I.e. if both diameter and radius are

                     shorthands with the anchor implied. Note that they do not combine, only the last  is  used.
                     For comined directions the main attribute command, <b>anchor</b> has to be used.

                     <b>ljust</b>  "anchor west"

              <b>aspect</b> <u>number</u>
                     Specifies  the  aspect  ratio,  i.e  ratio of width to height, of the <b>diamond</b> element.  The
                     manner  in  which  a  default  is  calculated  when  not  specified  also  depends  on  the
                     specifications of the attributes <b>width</b> and <b>height</b>, if any.

                     If  both <b>width</b>, and <b>height</b> are specified then any specification of <b>aspect</b> is ignored, as it
                     is implicitly defined in the width and height as well, and this takes precedence. A missing
                     specification is ignored in that case well, i.e. no defaults are required.

                     If the <b>aspect</b> is specified, and one of the attributes <b>width</b> or  <b>height</b>,  then  the  missing
                     attribute  is  calculated  from  the  two which are specified. No defaults are required for
                     these cases either.

                     If only one of the attributes <b>width</b> or <b>height</b> is specified then the system uses a  fallback
                     for  the  <b>aspect</b>,  the  value taken from the language variable <b>diamondaspect</b>, which itselfs
                     defaults to <b>2</b>.

                     If none of of the attributes <b>width</b> or <b>height</b> is specified then the system uses  a  fallback
                     for  the <b>width</b>, the value taken from the language variable <b>boxwidth</b>, which itselfs defaults
                     to the pixel equivalent of <b>2</b> <b>cm</b>. For the aspect it uses either the user-specified value  or
                     the default taken as described in the previous paragraph.

              <b>at</b> <u>location</u>
                     Specifies  the  location  of the element's corner named by the attribute <b>with</b>.  Defaults to
                     the current location as maintained by the layouting system.

              <b>color</b> <u>spec</u>
                     IMAGE: figure-21-style-colors Specifies the color used to draw the lines  of  the  element.
                     If  not  specified  the  system  falls  back  to the value taken from the language variable
                     <b>linecolor</b>, which itself defaults to <b>black</b>.

              <b>fillcolor</b> <u>spec</u>
                     IMAGE: figure-21-style-colors Specifies the color used to draw the inside of  the  element.
                     If  not  specified  the  system  falls  back  to the value taken from the language variable
                     <b>fillcolor</b>, which itself defaults to the empty string, signaling "no filling".

              <b>height</b> <u>length</u>
                     Specifies the height of the <b>diamond</b> element.  The manner in which a default  is  calculated
                     when  not  specified also depends on the specifications of the attributes <b>aspect</b> and <b>width</b>,
                     if any.

                     If both <b>width</b>, and <b>height</b> are specified then any specification of <b>aspect</b> is ignored, as  it
                     is implicitly defined in the width and height as well, and this takes precedence. A missing
                     specification is ignored in that case well, i.e. no defaults are required.

                     If  the  <b>aspect</b>  is  specified, and one of the attributes <b>width</b> or <b>height</b>, then the missing
                     attribute is calculated from the two which are specified.  No  defaults  are  required  for
                     these cases either.

                     If  only one of the attributes <b>width</b> or <b>height</b> is specified then the system uses a fallback
                     for the <b>aspect</b>, the value taken from the language  variable  <b>diamondaspect</b>,  which  itselfs
                     defaults to <b>2</b>.

                     If  none  of of the attributes <b>width</b> or <b>height</b> is specified then the system uses a fallback
                     for the <b>width</b>, the value taken from the language variable <b>boxwidth</b>, which itselfs  defaults
                     to  the pixel equivalent of <b>2</b> <b>cm</b>. For the aspect it uses either the user-specified value or
                     the default taken as described in the previous paragraph.

              <b>justify</b> <b>left</b>|<b>center</b>|<b>right</b>
                     Specifies how multi-line text associated with the element is  positioned  within  its  box.
                     The value is ignored if no text was specified for the element.  If not specified the system
                     falls  back to the value taken from the language variable <b>justify</b>, which itself defaults to
                     <b>left</b>.  The legal values are <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, and <b>center</b>.

              <b>stroke</b> <u>width</u>

                     variable <b>linewidth</b>, which itself defaults to <b>1</b>.

              <b>style</b> <u>spec</u>

              <b>smooth</b> Specifies the use of bezier splines for the <b>line</b> element.  If not specified lines are drawn
                     exactly through the specified waypoints, without any smooth curves.

              <b>stroke</b> <u>width</u>
                     IMAGE:  figure-20-style-stroke  Specifies the width of the lines drawn for the the element,
                     in pixels.  If not specified the system falls back to the value  taken  from  the  language
                     variable <b>linewidth</b>, which itself defaults to <b>1</b>.

              <b>style</b> <u>spec</u>
                     IMAGE:  figure-18-style-dash Specifies the style used to draw the lines of the element.  If
                     not specified the system  falls  back  to  the  value  taken  from  the  language  variable
                     <b>linestyle</b>,  which  itself defaults to <b>solid</b> lines.  The legal values are all those accepted
                     by <u>Tk_GetDash</u> [<a href="http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkLib/GetDash.htm">http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkLib/GetDash.htm</a>], and additionally all  which
                     are listed below:

                     <b>solid</b>, empty string
                            Draw solid line.

                     <b>dash</b>, <b>dashed</b>, <b>-</b>
                            Draw a dashed line.

                     <b>dot</b>, <b>dotted</b>, <b>.</b>
                            Draw a dotted line.

                     <b>dash-dot</b>, <b>-.</b>
                            Draw a dash-dotted line

                     <b>dash-dot-dot</b>, <b>-..</b>
                            Draw a dash-dot-dotted line.

                     Note  that  the  values "solid", "dot(ted)", "dash(ed)", "dash-dot", and "dash-dot-dot" are
                     all accepted as shorthands for the <b>style</b> command using them as argument.

              <b>text</b> <u>string</u>
                     Specifies the text to associate with the element.  Defaults  to  nothing.   When  specified
                     multiple  times  the  actually  shown  text is the concatenation of the individual strings,
                     vertically stacked, with the first string specified being the topmost element.

              <b>textcolor</b> <u>spec</u>
                     Specifies the color used to draw the text of an element with.  Ignored if there is no text.
                     If not specified the system falls back to  the  value  taken  from  the  language  variable
                     <b>textcolor</b>, which itself defaults to <b>black</b>.

              <b>textfont</b> <u>spec</u>
                     Specifies  the font used to draw the text of an element with.  Ignored if there is no text.
                     If not specified the system falls back to  the  value  taken  from  the  language  variable
                     <b>textfont</b>, which itself defaults to <b>Helvetica</b> <b>12pt</b>.

              <b>then</b> <u>location</u>

              <b>then</b> (&lt;direction&gt; ?<u>length</u>?)...

              (&lt;direction&gt; ?<u>length</u>?)...
                     This  attribute  specifies an intermediate location the <b>line</b> element has to go through.  It
                     can be specified multiple times, with each use adding one additional location to the series
                     which the line will go through. These location will be traversed in  the  order  they  were
                     specified.

                     The  location  can be given explicitly, or as a series of directions with distances. In the
                     latter case the names of all known directions are accepted for the direction part.   If  no
                     distance  is  specified  for  a direction the system falls back to the value taken from the
                     language variable <b>movelength</b>, which itself defaults to the pixel equivalent of <b>2</b>  <b>cm</b>.   The
                     whole  set  of  direction,distance  pairs  is treated as a series of translations which are
                     added up to provide the final translation specifying the intermediate  point  (relative  to
                     the preceding point).

                     The last named direction is propagated to the layout system as the direction to follow. The
                     use of <b>noturn</b> is not able to overide this behaviour.

                     At  last,  the names of the registered directions also serve as attribute commands, with an
                     implicit attribute <b>then</b> in front of them.

                     If no intermediate or last location is specified for the line the system falls  back  to  a
                     point  <b>movelength</b>  pixels  away  from  the  starting  location, in the current direction as
                     maintained by the layouting system

              <b>to</b> <u>location</u>
                     Specifies the location where the <b>line</b> element ends.  This attribute  has  no  default.  The
                     default is handled by the attribute <b>then</b>, which makes it appear as if <b>to</b> has a default when
                     not specified.

              <b>with</b> <u>corner</u>
                     <b>Line</b> elements are normally positioned absolutely, using the locations specified through the
                     attributes  <b>from</b>,  <b>then</b>,  and  <b>to</b>.   If  <b>at</b>  is  specified however then these positions are
                     translated a last time, moving the line's  corner  named  by  the  attribute  <b>with</b>  to  the
                     location  given  by  this  attribute.  This means that <u>with</u> is effective if and only if the
                     attribute <b>at</b> was specified as well for the line.

       <b>move</b> <u>attr</u>
              An open element with the corresponding corners, i.e. "start", "end", and "center".  A <b>move</b> element
              is in essence an invisible <b>line</b>.  While the main effect we are interested  in  is  the  change  it
              makes  to  the layout system, it is an actual element, i.e. it has the same corners as an ordinary
              line, and shows up in the history as well,  allowing  future  references  to  all  the  places  it
              touched.  It handles the same attibutes as <b>line</b> elements.

       <b>spline</b> <u>attr</u>...
              IMAGE:  figure-02-spline  An  alias  for  the  <b>line</b> element (see above), with the attribute <b>smooth</b>
              preset.

       <b>text</b> <u>attr</u>...
              IMAGE: figure-02-text A closed element with the corresponding corners, i.e. the  eight  directions
              of the compass rose, and "center".  It handles the attributes

              <b>anchor</b> <u>name</u>

              <b>ljust</b>

              <b>rjust</b>

              <b>above</b>

              <b>below</b>  IMAGE: figure-22-text-anchoring-3 Specifies the anchor of the text which is to be placed at
                     the  element's center, by name. I.e. this attribute defines the text's position relative to
                     the element's center.  The value is ignored if no text was specified for the  element.   If
                     not  specified  the system falls back to the value taken from the language variable <b>anchor</b>,
                     which itself defaults to <b>center</b>.  The legal values are all those accepted  by  <u>Tk_GetAnchor</u>
                     [<a href="http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkLib/GetAnchor.htm">http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkLib/GetAnchor.htm</a>].  The commands without arguments are all
                     shorthands  with  the anchor implied. Note that they do not combine, only the last is used.
                     For comined directions the main attribute command, <b>anchor</b> has to be used.

                     <b>ljust</b>  "anchor west"

                     <b>rjust</b>  "anchor east"

                     <b>above</b>  "anchor south"

                     <b>below</b>  "anchor north"

              <b>at</b> <u>location</u>
                     Specifies the location of the element's corner named by the attribute  <b>with</b>.   Defaults  to
                     the current location as maintained by the layouting system.

              <b>height</b> <u>length</u>
                     Specifies the height of the <b>text</b> element.  Defaults to the natural height of its text.

              <b>justify</b> <b>left</b>|<b>center</b>|<b>right</b>
                     Specifies  how  multi-line  text  associated with the element is positioned within its box.
                     The value is ignored if no text was specified for the element.  If not specified the system
                     falls back to the value taken from the language variable <b>justify</b>, which itself defaults  to
                     <b>left</b>.  The legal values are <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, and <b>center</b>.

              <b>text</b> <u>string</u>
                     Specifies  the  text  to  associate with the element.  Defaults to nothing.  When specified
                     multiple times the actually shown text is the  concatenation  of  the  individual  strings,
                     vertically stacked, with the first string specified being the topmost element.

              <b>textcolor</b> <u>spec</u>
                     Specifies the color used to draw the text of an element with.  Ignored if there is no text.
                     If  not  specified  the  system  falls  back  to the value taken from the language variable
                     <b>textcolor</b>, which itself defaults to <b>black</b>.

              <b>textfont</b> <u>spec</u>
                     Specifies the font used to draw the text of an element with.  Ignored if there is no  text.
                     If  not  specified  the  system  falls  back  to the value taken from the language variable
                     <b>textfont</b>, which itself defaults to <b>Helvetica</b> <b>12pt</b>.

              <b>width</b> <u>length</u>
                     Specifies the width of the <b>text</b> element.  Defaults to the natural width of its text.

              <b>with</b> <u>corner</u>
                     Specifies the corner of the element to place at the location given  by  the  attribute  <b>at</b>.
                     Defaults  to  the current corner as maintained by the layouting system, except if the value
                     for <b>at</b> was specified by the user. In that case it defaults to <b>center</b>.

   <b>ATTRIBUTES</b>
       The set of all attributes supported by all the element commands is shown below.  While we speak  of  them
       as  commands,  and provide a syntax, they are not truly available as actual commands, but only as part of
       the arguments for an element command.

       Note that some of the attribute names are overloaded, i.e. have multiple, different, definitions.  During
       processing  of  attributes  for  an element the actual definition used is chosen based on the type of the
       element the processing is for.

       Further, as a catch-all clause, any attribute which could not be processed according to  the  definitions
       below will be treated as the argument of an implicit <b>text</b> attribute.

       <b>anchor</b> <u>name</u>

       <b>ljust</b>

       <b>rjust</b>

       <b>above</b>

       <b>below</b>  IMAGE:  figure-22-text-anchoring-3  Specifies  the anchor of the text which is to be placed at the
              element's center, by name. I.e. this  attribute  defines  the  text's  position  relative  to  the
              element's  center.   The  value  is  ignored  if  no  text  was specified for the element.  If not
              specified the system falls back to the value taken from the language variable <b>anchor</b>, which itself
              defaults   to   <b>center</b>.    The   legal   values   are   all   those   accepted   by   <u>Tk_GetAnchor</u>
              [<a href="http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkLib/GetAnchor.htm">http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkLib/GetAnchor.htm</a>].    The  commands  without  arguments  are  all
              shorthands with the anchor implied. Note that they do not combine, only  the  last  is  used.  For
              comined directions the main attribute command, <b>anchor</b> has to be used.

              <b>ljust</b>  "anchor west"

              <b>rjust</b>  "anchor east"

              <b>above</b>  "anchor south"

              <b>below</b>  "anchor north"

       <b>arrowhead</b> <u>spec</u>
              IMAGE:  figure-19-style-arrowheads  Specifies where to draw arrowheads on the <b>line</b> element, at the
              beginning or end, at both ends, or none.  If not specified the system  falls  back  to  the  value
              taken from the language variable <b>arrowhead</b>, which itself defaults to <b>none</b>.  The legal values are

              <b>none</b>, <b>-</b>
                     Draw no arrowheads, at neither end of the line.

              <b>start</b>, <b>first</b>, <b>&lt;-</b>
                     Draw an arrowhead at the beginning of the line, but not at its end.

              <b>end</b>, <b>last</b>, <b>-&gt;</b>
                     Draw an arrowhead at the end of the line, but not at its beginning.

              <b>both</b>, <b>&lt;-&gt;</b>
                     Draw arrowheads at both ends of the line.

              Note that the values "start", "end", "-", "-&gt;", "&lt;-", and "&lt;-&gt;" are all accepted as shorthands for
              the <b>arrowhead</b> command using them as argument.

       <b>aspect</b> <u>number</u>
              Specifies  the  aspect ratio, i.e ratio of width to height, of the <b>diamond</b> element.  The manner in
              which a default is calculated when not  specified  also  depends  on  the  specifications  of  the
              attributes <b>width</b> and <b>height</b>, if any.

              If  both  <b>width</b>,  and  <b>height</b>  are specified then any specification of <b>aspect</b> is ignored, as it is
              implicitly defined in the width  and  height  as  well,  and  this  takes  precedence.  A  missing
              specification is ignored in that case well, i.e. no defaults are required.

              If  the <b>aspect</b> is specified, and one of the attributes <b>width</b> or <b>height</b>, then the missing attribute
              is calculated from the two which are specified. No defaults are required for these cases either.

              If only one of the attributes <b>width</b> or <b>height</b> is specified then the system uses a fallback for the
              <b>aspect</b>, the value taken from the language variable <b>diamondaspect</b>, which itselfs defaults to <b>2</b>.

              If none of of the attributes <b>width</b> or <b>height</b> is specified then the system uses a fallback for  the
              <b>width</b>,  the  value  taken from the language variable <b>boxwidth</b>, which itselfs defaults to the pixel
              equivalent of <b>2</b> <b>cm</b>. For the aspect it uses either the user-specified value or the default taken as
              described in the previous paragraph.

       <b>aspect</b> <u>number</u>
              Specifies the aspect ratio, i.e ratio of width to height, of the ellipses which are used  to  draw
              the top and bottom of the <b>drum</b> element.  If not specified the system falls back to the value taken
              from the language variable <b>drumaspect</b>, which itself defaults to <b>0.35</b>.

       <b>at</b> <u>location</u>
              Specifies  the  location  of  the  element's  corner named by the attribute <b>with</b>.  Defaults to the
              current location as maintained by the layouting system.

       <b>at</b> <u>location</u>
              <b>Line</b> elements are normally positioned  absolutely,  using  the  locations  specified  through  the
              attributes  <b>from</b>,  <b>then</b>, and <b>to</b>.  If <b>at</b> is specified however then these positions are translated a
              last time, moving the line's corner named by the attribute <b>with</b> to  the  location  given  by  this
              attribute.

       <b>chop</b> ?<u>length</u>?
              Specifies  the  length  of  the <b>line</b> element to remove from the beginning and/or end.  Defaults to
              nothing.  If specified once the chopping applies to both  beginning  and  end  of  the  line.   If
              specified  twice or more the last two specifications are used, and applied to beginning and end of
              the line, in this order.  Whenever the attribute is specified  without  an  explicit  length,  the
              system  falls  back  to  the  value  taken  from  the language variable <b>circleradius</b>, which itself
              defaults to the pixel equivalent of <b>1</b> <b>cm</b>

       <b>clockwise</b>

       <b>cw</b>     Specifies the direction of the <b>arc</b> element, here going clockwise.  The complementary attribute  is
              <b>counterclockwise</b>.   If  not  specified  the system falls back to the value taken from the language
              variable <b>clockwise</b>, which itself defaults to <b>false</b>, for counter-clockwise direction.

       <b>color</b> <u>spec</u>
              IMAGE: figure-21-style-colors Specifies the color used to draw the lines of the element.   If  not
              specified  the  system  falls  back to the value taken from the language variable <b>linecolor</b>, which
              itself defaults to <b>black</b>.

       <b>counterclockwise</b>

       <b>ccw</b>    Specifies the direction of the <b>arc</b> element, here counter-clockwise.  The  complementary  attribute
              is  <b>clockwise</b>.   If  not  specified  the  system  falls  back to the value taken from the language
              variable <b>clockwise</b>, which itself defaults to <b>false</b>, for counter-clockwise direction.

       <b>diameter</b> <u>length</u>

       <b>diam</b> <u>length</u>
              Specifies the diameter of the <b>circle</b> element,  as  an  alternative  way  to  specify  its  <b>radius</b>.
              Effective  if  and  only  if  the  radius  was not specified. I.e. if both diameter and radius are
              specified then the radius infomration has precendence.  This attribute has no default, because the
              defaults are taken from the radius.

       <b>fillcolor</b> <u>spec</u>
              IMAGE: figure-21-style-colors Specifies the color used to draw the inside of the element.  If  not
              specified  the  system  falls  back to the value taken from the language variable <b>fillcolor</b>, which
              itself defaults to the empty string, signaling "no filling".

       <b>from</b> <u>location</u>
              Specifies the location where the <b>line</b>  element  begins.   Defaults  to  the  current  location  as
              maintained by the layouting system.

       <b>from</b> <u>location</u>
              Specifies  the  location  where  the  <b>arc</b>  element  begins.   Defaults  to the current location as
              maintained by the layouting system.

       <b>height</b> <u>length</u>

       <b>ht</b> <u>length</u>
              Specifies the height of the element.  If not specified the system falls back to  the  value  taken
              from the language variable <b>boxheight</b>, which itself defaults to the pixel equivalent of <b>2</b> <b>cm</b>.

       <b>height</b> <u>length</u>
              Specifies the height of the <b>diamond</b> element.  The manner in which a default is calculated when not
              specified also depends on the specifications of the attributes <b>aspect</b> and <b>width</b>, if any.

              If  both  <b>width</b>,  and  <b>height</b>  are specified then any specification of <b>aspect</b> is ignored, as it is
              implicitly defined in the width  and  height  as  well,  and  this  takes  precedence.  A  missing
              specification is ignored in that case well, i.e. no defaults are required.

              If  the <b>aspect</b> is specified, and one of the attributes <b>width</b> or <b>height</b>, then the missing attribute
              is calculated from the two which are specified. No defaults are required for these cases either.

              If only one of the attributes <b>width</b> or <b>height</b> is specified then the system uses a fallback for the
              <b>aspect</b>, the value taken from the language variable <b>diamondaspect</b>, which itselfs defaults to <b>2</b>.

              If none of of the attributes <b>width</b> or <b>height</b> is specified then the system uses a fallback for  the
              <b>width</b>,  the  value  taken from the language variable <b>boxwidth</b>, which itselfs defaults to the pixel
              equivalent of <b>2</b> <b>cm</b>. For the aspect it uses either the user-specified value or the default taken as
              described in the previous paragraph.

       <b>height</b> <u>length</u>
              Specifies the height of the <b>text</b> element.  Defaults to the natural height of its text.

       <b>justify</b> <b>left</b>|<b>center</b>|<b>right</b>
              Specifies how multi-line text associated with the element is positioned within its box.  The value
              is ignored if no text was specified for the element.  If not specified the system  falls  back  to
              the  value  taken  from  the  language variable <b>justify</b>, which itself defaults to <b>left</b>.  The legal
              values are <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, and <b>center</b>.

       <b>noturn</b> Specifies that the direction of  <b>line</b>  element  at  its  end  is  not  propagated  to  the  layout
              management.  If not specified the direction of the line becomes the new direction the layout.

       <b>radius</b> <u>length</u>

       <b>rad</b> <u>length</u>
              Specifies  the  radius of the <b>circle</b> element.  If not specified the system falls back to the value
              taken from the language variable <b>circleradius</b>, which itself defaults to the pixel equivalent of  <b>1</b>
              <b>cm</b>.

       <b>radius</b> <u>length</u>
              Specifies  the  radius  of the <b>arc</b> element, or rather, the radius of the circle the shown arc is a
              part of.  If not specified the system falls back to the value taken  from  the  language  variable
              <b>arcradius</b>, which itself defaults to the pixel equivalent of <b>1</b> <b>cm</b>.

       <b>slant</b> <u>angle</u>
              Specifies  the angle by which the <b>box</b> element is slanted, in degrees.  If not specified the system
              falls back to the value taken from the language variable <b>slant</b>, which itself defaults to <b>90</b>,  i.e.
              vertical,  no  slant.   0 degrees is slanting straight east, pointing to the right.  90 degrees is
              slanting to the north, pointing straight up.

       <b>smooth</b> Specifies the use of bezier splines for the <b>line</b>  element.   If  not  specified  lines  are  drawn
              exactly through the specified waypoints, without any smooth curves.

       <b>stroke</b> <u>width</u>
              IMAGE:  figure-20-style-stroke  Specifies  the  width  of  the lines drawn for the the element, in
              pixels.  If not specified the system falls back to the value  taken  from  the  language  variable
              <b>linewidth</b>, which itself defaults to <b>1</b>.

       <b>style</b> <u>spec</u>
              IMAGE:  figure-18-style-dash  Specifies  the  style used to draw the lines of the element.  If not
              specified the system falls back to the value taken from the  language  variable  <b>linestyle</b>,  which
              itself  defaults  to  <b>solid</b>  lines.   The  legal  values  are  all  those  accepted  by <u>Tk_GetDash</u>
              [<a href="http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkLib/GetDash.htm">http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkLib/GetDash.htm</a>], and additionally all which are listed below:

              <b>solid</b>, empty string
                     Draw solid line.

              <b>dash</b>, <b>dashed</b>, <b>-</b>
                     Draw a dashed line.

              <b>dot</b>, <b>dotted</b>, <b>.</b>
                     Draw a dotted line.

              <b>dash-dot</b>, <b>-.</b>
                     Draw a dash-dotted line

              <b>dash-dot-dot</b>, <b>-..</b>
                     Draw a dash-dot-dotted line.

              Note that the values "solid", "dot(ted)",  "dash(ed)",  "dash-dot",  and  "dash-dot-dot"  are  all
              accepted as shorthands for the <b>style</b> command using them as argument.

       <b>text</b> <u>string</u>
              Specifies  the  text to associate with the element.  Defaults to nothing.  When specified multiple
              times the actually shown text is the concatenation of the individual strings, vertically  stacked,
              with the first string specified being the topmost element.

       <b>textcolor</b> <u>spec</u>
              Specifies  the  color  used to draw the text of an element with.  Ignored if there is no text.  If
              not specified the system falls back to the value taken from the language variable <b>textcolor</b>, which
              itself defaults to <b>black</b>.

       <b>textfont</b> <u>spec</u>
              Specifies the font used to draw the text of an element with.  Ignored if there is no text.  If not
              specified the system falls back to the value taken from  the  language  variable  <b>textfont</b>,  which
              itself defaults to <b>Helvetica</b> <b>12pt</b>.

       <b>then</b> <u>location</u>

       <b>then</b> (&lt;direction&gt; ?<u>length</u>?)...

       (&lt;direction&gt; ?<u>length</u>?)...
              This  attribute  specifies an intermediate location the <b>line</b> element has to go through.  It can be
              specified multiple times, with each use adding one additional location to  the  series  which  the
              line will go through. These location will be traversed in the order they were specified.

              The  location  can be given explicitly, or as a series of directions with distances. In the latter
              case the names of all known directions are accepted for the direction part.   If  no  distance  is
              specified  for  a  direction  the  system falls back to the value taken from the language variable
              <b>movelength</b>,  which  itself  defaults  to  the  pixel  equivalent  of  <b>2</b>  <b>cm</b>.   The  whole  set  of
              direction,distance  pairs is treated as a series of translations which are added up to provide the
              final translation specifying the intermediate point (relative to the preceding point).

              The last named direction is propagated to the layout system as the direction to follow. The use of
              <b>noturn</b> is not able to overide this behaviour.

              At last, the names of the registered directions also serve as attribute commands, with an implicit
              attribute <b>then</b> in front of them.

              If no intermediate or last location is specified for the line the system falls  back  to  a  point
              <b>movelength</b>  pixels  away from the starting location, in the current direction as maintained by the
              layouting system

       <b>to</b> <u>location</u>
              Specifies the location where the <b>line</b> element ends.  This attribute has no default. The default is
              handled by the attribute <b>then</b>, which makes it appear as if <b>to</b> has a default when not specified.

       <b>to</b> <u>location</u>
              Specifies the location where the <b>arc</b> element ends.  Defaults to a location such that  a  90-degree
              arc is drawn in the chosen direction, starting at <b>from</b>.

       <b>width</b> <u>length</u>

       <b>wid</b> <u>length</u>
              Specifies  the  width  of  the element.  If not specified the system falls back to the value taken
              from the language variable <b>boxwidth</b>, which itself defaults to the pixel equivalent of <b>2</b> <b>cm</b>.

       <b>width</b> <u>length</u>
              Specifies the width of the <b>diamond</b> element.  The manner in which a default is calculated when  not
              specified also depends on the specifications of the attributes <b>aspect</b> and <b>height</b>, if any.

              If  both  <b>width</b>,  and  <b>height</b>  are specified then any specification of <b>aspect</b> is ignored, as it is
              implicitly defined in the width  and  height  as  well,  and  this  takes  precedence.  A  missing
              specification is ignored in that case well, i.e. no defaults are required.

              If  the <b>aspect</b> is specified, and one of the attributes <b>width</b> or <b>height</b>, then the missing attribute
              is calculated from the two which are specified. No defaults are required for these cases either.

              If only one of the attributes <b>width</b> or <b>height</b> is specified then the system uses a fallback for the
              <b>aspect</b>, the value taken from the language variable <b>diamondaspect</b>, which itselfs defaults to <b>2</b>.

              If none of of the attributes <b>width</b> or <b>height</b> is specified then the system uses a fallback for  the
              <b>width</b>,  the  value  taken from the language variable <b>boxwidth</b>, which itselfs defaults to the pixel
              equivalent of <b>2</b> <b>cm</b>. For the aspect it uses either the user-specified value or the default taken as
              described in the previous paragraph.

       <b>width</b> <u>length</u>
              Specifies the width of the <b>text</b> element.  Defaults to the natural width of its text.

       <b>with</b> <u>corner</u>
              Specifies the corner of the element to place at the location given by the attribute <b>at</b>.   Defaults
              to  the  current  corner  as  maintained  by  the layouting system, except if the value for <b>at</b> was
              specified by the user. In that case it defaults to <b>center</b>.

       <b>with</b> <u>corner</u>
              <b>Line</b> elements are normally positioned  absolutely,  using  the  locations  specified  through  the
              attributes  <b>from</b>,  <b>then</b>, and <b>to</b>.  If <b>at</b> is specified however then these positions are translated a
              last time, moving the line's corner named by the attribute <b>with</b> to  the  location  given  by  this
              attribute.   This  means  that  <u>with</u> is effective if and only if the attribute <b>at</b> was specified as
              well for the line.

   <b>CORNERS</b>
       Corners are named values for in elements, usually locations.

       •      The <u>closed</u> elements define corners for the compass rose, including the "center", and their "width"
              and "height".

              IMAGE: figure-27-corners-closed

       •      <b>block</b> elements additionally export all  variables  which  were  set  during  their  definition  as
              corners.

       •      The  <u>open</u> elements on the other hand define "start", "end", and "center". The first two map to the
              locations originally provided through the attributes <b>from</b> and <b>to</b> of the element.

              IMAGE: figure-28-corners-open

       •      The center of <b>line</b> and <b>move</b> elements is the location halfway between "start"  and  "end"  corners,
              this is regardless of any intermediate locations the element may have.

       •      The  <b>line</b>  and  <b>move</b>  elements  additionally  name all their locations as corners using numbers as
              names, starting from <b>1</b> (equivalent to "start"), in order of traversal.

              IMAGE: figure-15-spline-1

       •      The center of <b>arc</b> elements is the center of the circle the arc is part off.

       •      The <b>arc</b> elements additionally define the compass rose of closed elements as well.

   <b>NAMED</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b>
       The named directions are commands which tell the layout system in which direction to go when placing  the
       next  element  without  an  explicit  position  specification.  They can also be used as arguments to the
       attribute <b>then</b>, and the command <b>by</b> for relative points, see there for the relevant syntax.

       The diagram core defines the directions of the compass rose, plus a number of aliases. See below for  the
       full list.

       IMAGE: figure-27-corners-closed

       This  overlaps  with the pre-defined corners for closed elements. This is used by the layout system, when
       are going in direction X the name of the opposite direction is the name of the corner at  which  the  new
       element  will  be  attached to the current position, and if this corner does not exist the nearest actual
       corner by angle is used.

   <b>MISCELLANEOUS</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       <u>number</u> <b>cm</b>

       <u>number</u> <b>mm</b>

       <u>number</u> <b>inch</b>

       <u>number</u> <b>pt</b>
              These commands allow the specification of distances and coordinates in metric and imperial  units,
              returning  the  equivalent distance or coordinate in pixels, which is the unit used internally for
              all calculations.

              The conversion factors are based on the result of <b>tk</b> <b>scaling</b> and are computed once,  at  the  time
              the package is sourced, future changes of the <b>tk</b> <b>scaling</b> factor have no effect.

       <u>number</u> <u>number</u>

              IMAGE: figure-50-point-cons-absolute

              This command takes the x and y coordinates of a location and returns the <u>absolute</u> point for it.

       <b>by</b> <u>distance</u> <u>direction</u>

              IMAGE: figure-51-point-cons-relative

              This  command  takes a <u>distance</u> and <u>direction</u> (angle in degress, or registered direction name) and
              returns the <u>relative</u> point for it, i.e. the <u>delta</u> or <u>translation</u> it represents.

              Note also the (dis)similarities to the directional specifications for the attribute <b>then</b>  of  <b>line</b>
              and <b>move</b> elements.  Where we say here

              by 50 east

              for the attribute we say

              ... then east 50 ...

              or just

              ... then east ...

       <u>point1</u> <b>+</b> <u>point2</u>

              IMAGE: figure-48-point-vectoradd

              This  command  interprets  two  points  as vectors and adds them together.  If at least one of the
              points is <u>absolute</u> the result is absolute as well.  The result is a <u>relative</u> point if and only  if
              both points are <u>relative</u>.

       <u>point1</u> <b>-</b> <u>point2</u>

              IMAGE: figure-49-point-vectorsub

              This  command  interprets  two  points  as vectors and subtracts the second from the first.  If at
              least one of the points is <u>absolute</u> the result is absolute as well.   The  result  is  a  <u>relative</u>
              point if and only if both points are <u>relative</u>.

       <u>point</u> <b>by</b> <u>distance</u> <u>direction</u>
              This command is a more convenient, or at least shorter, form of

                  [$point + [by $distance $direction]]

       <u>point1</u> <b>|</b> <u>point2</u>

              IMAGE: figure-31-point-projection

              This  command  calculates the <u>projection</u> of two points, i.e. the result is the point having the x-
              coordinate of <u>point1</u> and the y-coordinate of <u>point2</u>.

       <u>n</u> <b>between</b> <u>poin1</u> <u>point2</u>

              IMAGE: figure-29-point-interpolation-1

              This command computes the point which is <u>n</u>*100 percent of the way between <u>point1</u> and  <u>point2</u>,  and
              returns it as its result.  This means that for

              <u>n</u> == 0 The result is <u>point1</u>.

              <u>n</u> == 1 The result is <u>point2</u>.

              <u>n</u> == 0.5
                     The result is half way between the two points.

              etc.  <u>Note</u> that it is allowed to use values &lt; 0 and &gt; 1 for <u>n</u>

       <b>intersect</b> <u>elem1</u> <u>elem2</u>

              IMAGE: figure-32-point-intersection

              This  command  takes  two  <u>open</u>  elements,  computes  the  lines  going through their "start"- and
              "end"-corners, and returns the point where these two lines intersect.  The command throws an error
              if the lines do not intersect, or are coincident.

       <u>element</u> <b>names</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              This command returns a list containing the names of all corners for the <u>element</u>. If a  pattern  is
              specified  then only the names matching it (via <b>string</b> <b>match</b> are returned. Otherwise all names are
              returned (equivalent to a default pattern of <b>*</b>).

       <u>element</u> <u>corner</u>
              This command returns the value for the <u>corner</u> of the <u>element</u>.  This  can  be  anything,  including
              points and elements.

       <u>element</u> <u>corner1</u> <u>corner2</u>...
              This is a convenience shorthand for

              [[[$elem $corner1] $corner2] ...]

              assuming that the value for

               [$elem $corner1]
       again an element.

       <u>element</u> ?<u>corner1</u>... ?<b>names</b> ?<u>pattern</u>??]?
              This is a convenience shorthand for

              [[[$elem $corner1] ...] names ?pattern?]

              assuming that the value for

               [$elem $corner1]
       again an element.

       <b>n</b>th ?<u>corner</u>?
              This command asks the diagram history for the <b>n</b>th element created, searching from the beginning of
              the  history  (counting from 1) and returns it as its result.  If the <u>corner</u> is specified then the
              value for this corner is returned instead.

       <b>n</b>th <b>last</b> ?<u>corner</u>?
              This command asks the diagram history for the <b>n</b>th element created, searching from the end  of  the
              history  and  returns it as its result.  If the <u>corner</u> is specified then the value for this corner
              is returned instead.

       <b>n</b>th <u>shape</u> ?<u>corner</u>?
              This command asks the diagram history for the <b>n</b>th element created, of the given  <u>shape</u>,  searching
              from  the  beginning of the history (counting from 1) and returns it as its result.  If the <u>corner</u>
              is specified then the value for this corner is returned instead.

       <b>n</b>th <b>last</b> <u>shape</u> ?<u>corner</u>?
              This command asks the diagram history for the <b>n</b>th element created, of the given  <u>shape</u>,  searching
              from  the  end  of  the history and returns it as its result.  If the <u>corner</u> is specified then the
              value for this corner is returned instead.

       <b>last</b> ?<u>corner</u>?

       <b>last</b> <u>shape</u> ?<u>corner</u>?

</pre><h4><b>DIAGRAM</b> <b>CLASSES</b> <b>The</b> <b>intended</b> <b>audience</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>section</b> <b>are</b> <b>developers</b> <b>wishing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b></h4><pre>
       on the internals of the diagram package.  Regular users of <b>diagram</b> can skip this section without  missing
       anything.

       The  main  information  seen  here is the figure below, showing the hierarchy of the classes implementing
       diagram.

       IMAGE: figure-00-dependencies

       At the bottom, all at the same level are the supporting packages like <b>snit</b>, etc. These can all  be  found
       in Tcllib.

       Above them is the set of diagram classes implementing the various aspects of the system, i.e.:

       <b>diagram</b>
              The main class, that which is seen by the user.

       <b>diagram::core</b>
              The core engine, itself distributed over four helper classes.

       <b>diagram::basic</b>
              The implementation of the standard shapes, like box, circle, etc., based on the extension features
              of the core.

       <b>diagram::element</b>
              Core support class, the database of created elements. It also keeps the history, i.e. the order in
              which elements were created.

       <b>diagram::attribute</b>
              Core support class, the generic handling of definition and processing of attributes.

       <b>diagram::direction</b>
              Core support class, the database of named directions.

       <b>diagram::navigation</b>
              Core support class, the state of layout engine, i.e. current position and directin, and operations
              on it.

       <b>diagram::point</b>
              General support class handling various vector operations.
