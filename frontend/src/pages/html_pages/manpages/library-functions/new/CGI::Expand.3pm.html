</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CGI::Expand - convert flat hash to nested data using TT2's dot convention

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use CGI::Expand ();
           use CGI; # or Apache::Request, etc.

           $args = CGI::Expand-&gt;expand_cgi( CGI-&gt;new('a.0=3&amp;a.2=4&amp;b.c.0=x') );

       Or, as an imported function for convenience:

           use CGI::Expand;
           use CGI; # or Apache::Request, etc.

           $args = expand_cgi( CGI-&gt;new('a.0=3&amp;a.2=4&amp;b.c.0=x') );
           # $args = { a =&gt; [3,undef,4], b =&gt; { c =&gt; ['x'] }, }

           # Or to catch exceptions:
           eval {
               $args = expand_cgi( CGI-&gt;new('a.0=3&amp;a.2=4&amp;b.c.0=x') );
           } or log_and_exit( $@ );

           #-----
           use CGI::Expand qw(expand_hash);

           $args = expand_hash({'a.0'=&gt;77}); # $args = { a =&gt; [ 77 ] }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Converts a CGI query into structured data using a dotted name convention similar to TT2.

       "expand_cgi" works with CGI.pm, Apache::Request or anything with an appropriate "param" method.  Or you
       can use "expand_hash" directly.

       If you prefer to use a different flattening convention then CGI::Expand can be subclassed.

</pre><h4><b>MOTIVATION</b></h4><pre>
       The Common Gateway Interface restricts parameters to name=value pairs, but often we'd like to use more
       structured data.  This module uses a name encoding convention to rebuild a hash of hashes, arrays and
       values.  Arrays can either be indexed explicitly or from CGI's multi-valued parameter handling.

       The generic nature of this process means that the core components of your system can remain CGI ignorant
       and operate on structured data.  Better for modularity, better for testing.

</pre><h4><b>DOT</b> <b>CONVENTION</b></h4><pre>
       The key-value pair "a.b.1=hi" expands to the perl structure:

         { a =&gt; { b =&gt; [ undef, "hi" ] }

       The key ("a.b.1") specifies the location at which the value ("hi") is stored.  The key is split on '.'
       characters, the first segment ("a") is a key in the top level hash, subsequent segments may be keys in
       sub-hashes or indices in sub-arrays.  Integer segments are treated as array indices, others as hash keys.

       Array size is limited to 100 by default.  The limit can be altered by subclassing or using the deprecated
       $Max_Array package variable.  See below.

       The backslash '\' escapes the next character in cgi parameter names allowing '.' , '\' and digits in hash
       keys.  The escaping '\' is removed.  Values are not altered.

   <b>Key-Value</b> <b>Examples</b>
         # HoHoL
         a.b.1=hi ---&gt; { a =&gt; { b =&gt; [ undef, "hi" ] }

         # HoLoH
         a.1.b=hi ---&gt; { a =&gt; [ undef, { b =&gt; "hi" } ] }

         # top level always a hash
         9.0=hi   ---&gt; { "9" =&gt; [ "hi" ] }

         # can backslash escape to treat digits hash as keys
         a.\0=hi     ---&gt; { "a" =&gt; { 0 =&gt; "hi"} }

         # or to put . and \ literals in keys
         a\\b\.c=hi  ---  { 'a\\b\.c' =&gt; "hi" }

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b> <b>/</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The routines listed below are all methods, but can be imported to be called as functions.  In other
       words, you can call "CGI::Expand-&gt;expand_hash(...)"  or you can import "expand_hash" and then call
       expand_hash(...) without using method invocation syntax.

       "expand_cgi" is exported by default. "expand_hash" and "collapse_hash" are exported upon request.

       expand_cgi
               my $deep_hash = expand_cgi ( $CGI_object_or_similar );

           Takes a CGI object and returns a hashref for the expanded data structure (or dies, see "EXCEPTIONS").

           Wrapper  around  expand_hash  that uses the "param" method of the CGI object to collect the names and
           values.

           Handles multivalued parameters as array refs (although they can't be mixed with  indexed  arrays  and
           will have an undefined ordering).

               $query = 'a.0=3&amp;a.2=4&amp;b.c.0=x&amp;c.0=2&amp;c.1=3&amp;d=&amp;e=1&amp;e=2';

               $args = expand_cgi( CGI-&gt;new($query) );

               # result:
               # $args = {
               #   a =&gt; [3,undef,4],
               #   b =&gt; { c =&gt; ['x'] },
               #   c =&gt; ['2','3'],
               #   d =&gt; '',
               #   e =&gt; ['1','2'], # order depends on CGI/etc
               # };

       expand_hash
               my $deep_hash = expand_hash( $flat_hash );

           Expands the keys of the parameter hash according to the dot convention (or dies, see "EXCEPTIONS").

               $args = expand_hash({ 'a.b.1' =&gt; [1,2] });
               # $args = { a =&gt; { b =&gt; [undef, [1,2] ] } }

       collapse_hash
               my $flat_hash = collapse_hash( $deep_hash );

           The inverse of expand_hash.  Converts the $deep_hash data structure back into a flat hash.

               $flat = collapse_hash({ a =&gt; { b =&gt; [undef, [1,2] ] } });
               # $flat = { 'a.b.1.0' =&gt; 1, 'a.b.1.1' =&gt; 2 }

</pre><h4><b>EXCEPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>WARNING</b>:  The  <u>users</u>  of  your  site  can  cause these exceptions so you must decide how they are handled
       (possibly by letting the process die).

       "CGI param array limit exceeded..."
           If an array index exceeds the array limit (default: 100) then an exception is thrown.

       "CGI param clash for..."
           A cgi query like "a=1&amp;a.b=1" would require the value of $args-&gt;{a} to be both 1 and { b =&gt; 1 }.  Such
           type inconsistencies are reported as exceptions.  (See test.pl for for examples)

</pre><h4><b>SUBCLASSING</b></h4><pre>
       Subclassing in now the preferred way to change the behaviour and defaults.  (Previously package variables
       were used, see test.pl).

       The methods which may be overridden by subclasses are separator, max_array, split_name and join_name.

       max_array
               $subclass-&gt;max_Array;

           The limit for the array size, defaults to 100.  The value 0 can be used to disable the use of arrays,
           everthing is a hash key.

       separator
               $subclass-&gt;separator;

           Returns the separator characters used to split the keys of the flat hash.  The  default  is  '.'  but
           multiple characters are allowed.  The default join will use the first character.

           If  there  is  no  separator  then  '\' escaping does not occur.  This is for use with split_name and
           join_name below.

       split_name
               my @segments = $subclass-&gt;split_name($name);

           The split_name method must break $name in to key segments for the nested data structure.  The default
           version just splits on the separator characters with a bit of fiddling to handle escaping.

       join_name
               my $name = $subclass-&gt;join_name(@segments);

           The inverse of split_name, joins the segments back to the key for the flat hash.  The default version
           uses the first character of the string returned by the separator method.

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       $CGI::Expand::Separator and $CGI::Expand::Max_Array are deprecated.  They still work for now but  emit  a
       warning (supressed with $CGI::Expand::BackCompat = 1)

       Using  the  functions  by their fully qualified names ceased to work at around version 1.04.  They're now
       class methods so just replace the last :: with -&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The top level is always a hash.  Consequently, any digit only names will be keys in this hash rather than
       array indices.

       Image inputs with name.x, name.y coordinates are ignored as they will class with the value for name.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       Thing about ways to keep $cgi and the expanded version in sync

       Glob style parameters (with SCALAR, ARRAY and HASH slots) would resolve the type clashes, probably no fun
       to use.  Look at using Template::Plugin::StringTree to avoid path clashes

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       •   HTTP::Rollup - Replaces CGI.pm completely, no list ordering.

       •   CGI::State - Tied to CGI.pm, unclear error checking

       •   Template::Plugin::StringTree

       •   Hash::Flatten - Pick your delimiters

       •   <a href="http://template-toolkit.org/pipermail/templates/2002-January/002368.html">http://template-toolkit.org/pipermail/templates/2002-January/002368.html</a>

       •   There's a tiny and beautiful reduce solution somewhere on perlmonks.
