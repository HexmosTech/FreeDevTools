       Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::Shortcircuit - short-circuit evaluation for certain rules

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         loadplugin     Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::Shortcircuit

         report Content analysis details:   (_SCORE_ points, _REQD_ required, s/c _SCTYPE_)

         add_header all Status "_YESNO_, score=_SCORE_ required=_REQD_ tests=_TESTS_ shortcircuit=_SCTYPE_ autolearn=_AUTOLEARN_ version=_VERSION_"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This plugin implements simple, test-based shortcircuiting.  Shortcircuiting a test will force all other
       pending rules to be skipped, if that test is hit.  In addition, a symbolic rule, "SHORTCIRCUIT", will
       fire.

       Recommended usage is to use "priority" to set rules with strong S/O values (ie.  1.0) to be run first,
       and make instant spam or ham classification based on that.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The following configuration settings are used to control shortcircuiting:

       shortcircuit SYMBOLIC_TEST_NAME {ham|spam|on|off}
           Shortcircuiting a test will force all other pending rules to be skipped, if that test is hit.

           Recommended  usage  is  to  use  "priority"  to set rules with strong S/O values (ie.  1.0) to be run
           first, and make instant spam or ham classification based on that.

           To override a test that uses shortcircuiting, you can set the classification type to "off".

           Note that DNS and other network lookups are launched when SA reaches priority -100.  If you  want  to
           shortcircuit  scanning  before any network queries are sent, you need to set lower than -100 priority
           to any such rule, like -200 as in the examples below.

           Shortcircuited test will be automatically set to priority -200, but only if the original priority  is
           unchanged at default 0.

           on  Shortcircuits  the  rest  of the tests, but does not make a strict classification of spam or ham.
               Rather, it uses the default score for the rule being shortcircuited.  This would allow  you,  for
               example, to define a rule such as

                 body TEST /test/
                 describe TEST test rule that scores barely over spam threshold
                 score TEST 5.5
                 priority TEST -200
                 shortcircuit TEST on

               The  result  of a message hitting the above rule would be a final score of 5.5, as opposed to 100
               (default) if it were classified as spam.

           off Disables shortcircuiting on said rule.

           spam
               Shortcircuit the rule using a set of defaults; override the default score of this rule  with  the
               score  from "shortcircuit_spam_score", set the "noautolearn" tflag, and set priority to -200.  In
               other words, equivalent to:

                 shortcircuit TEST on
                 priority TEST -200
                 score TEST 100
                 tflags TEST noautolearn

           ham Shortcircuit the rule using a set of defaults; override the default score of this rule  with  the
               score from "shortcircuit_ham_score", set the "noautolearn" and "nice" tflags, and set priority to
               -200.   In other words, equivalent to:

                 shortcircuit TEST on
                 priority TEST -200
                 score TEST -100
                 tflags TEST noautolearn nice

       shortcircuit_spam_score n.nn (default: 100)
           When  shortcircuit is used on a rule, and the shortcircuit classification type is set to "spam", this
           value should be applied in place of the default score for that rule.

       shortcircuit_ham_score n.nn (default: -100)
           When shortcircuit is used on a rule, and the shortcircuit classification type is set to  "ham",  this
           value should be applied in place of the default score for that rule.

       shortcircuit_min_ham_score n.nn (default: undef)
           When  shortcircuit_min_ham_score  is  set, SpamAssassin will stop processing when total score will be
           lower then this value.

       shortcircuit_max_spam_score n.nn (default: undef)
           When shortcircuit_max_spam_score is set, SpamAssassin will stop processing when total score  will  be
           higher then this value.
