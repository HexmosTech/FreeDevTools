       This module contains a list of words and expressions supporting the language. It is not intended to be

           This  is a list of expressions use to designate morning or afternoon time when a time is entered as a
           12-hour time rather than a 24-hour time.   For  example,  in  English,  the  time  "17:00"  could  be
           specified as "5:00 PM".

           Morning and afternoon time may be designated by the following sets of words:

              AM
              A.M.

              PM
              P.M.

       <b>Each</b> <b>or</b> <b>every</b>
           There  are  a  list  of  words  that  specify  every  occurrence of something.  These are used in the
           following phrases:

              EACH Monday
              EVERY Monday

              PREVIOUS Tuesday

              LAST day of the month

       <b>Delta</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> <b>going</b> <b>forward/backward</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b>
           When  parsing  deltas, there are words that may be used to specify the the delta will refer to a time
           in the future or to a time in the past (relative to some date).  In English, for example,  you  might
           say:

              IN 5 days
              5 days AGO

           The  following  words  may  be  used  to  specify  deltas  that  refer to dates in the past or future
           respectively:

              ago
              past
              in the past
              earlier
              before now
              hence

              in
              later
              future
              in the future
              from now

       <b>Business</b> <b>mode</b>
           This contains two lists of words which can be used to specify a standard (i.e. non-business) delta or
           a business delta.

           Previously, it was used to tell whether the delta was approximate or exact, but now this list is  not
           used except to force the delta to be standard.

           The following words may be used:

              exactly
              approximately

           The following words may be used to specify a business delta:

              business

       <b>Ignored</b> <b>words</b>
           In writing out dates in common forms, there are a number of words that are typically not important.

           There is frequently a word that appears in a phrase to designate that a time is going to be specified
           next.  In English, you would use the word AT in the example:

              December 3 at 12:00

           The following words may be used:

              at

           Another word is used to designate one member of a set.  In English, you would use the words IN or OF:

              1st day OF December
              1st day IN December

           The following words may be used:

              of
              in

           Another word is use to specify that something is on a certain date.  In English, you would use ON:

              ON July 5th

           The following words may be used:

              on

       <b>Words</b> <b>that</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>date,</b> <b>time,</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b>
           There are some words that can be used to specify a date, a time, or both relative to now.

           Words  that  set  the  date  are  similar  to the English words 'yesterday' or 'tomorrow'.  These are
           specified as a delta which is added to the current time to get a date.  The time is NOT set  however,
           so the delta is only partially used (it should only include year, month, week, and day fields).

           The following words may be used:

              ereyesterday         -0:0:0:2:0:0:0
              overmorrow           +0:0:0:2:0:0:0
              today                0:0:0:0:0:0:0
              tomorrow             +0:0:0:1:0:0:0
              yesterday            -0:0:0:1:0:0:0

           Words that set only the time of day are similar to the English words 'noon' or 'midnight'.

           The following words may be used:

              midnight             00:00:00
              noon                 12:00:00

           Words that set the entire time and date (relative to the current time and date) are also available.

           In English, the word 'now' is one of these.

           The following words may be used:

              now                  0:0:0:0:0:0:0

       <b>Hour/Minute/Second</b> <b>separators</b>
           When  specifying the time of day, the most common separator is a colon (:) which can be used for both
           separators.

           Some languages use different pairs.  For example, French allows you to specify the time as  13h30:20,
           so it would use the following pairs:

              : :
              h :

           The  first  column is the hour-minute separator and the second column is the minute-second separator.
           Both are perl  regular  expressions.   When  creating  a  new  translation,  be  aware  that  regular
           expressions  with  utf-8  characters  may be tricky.  For example, don't include the expression '[x]'
           where 'x' is a utf-8 character.

           A pair of colons is ALWAYS allowed for all languages.  If a language allows  additional  pairs,  they
           are listed here:

              Not defined in this language
