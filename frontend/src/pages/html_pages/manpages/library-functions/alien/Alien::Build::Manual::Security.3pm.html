       Alien::Build::Manual::Security - General alien author documentation

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.84

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        perldoc Alien::Build::Manual::Security

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You are rightly concerned that an Alien might be downloading something random off the internet.  This
       manual will describe some of the real risks and go over how you can mitigate them.

   <b>no</b> <b>warranty</b>
       Alien::Build provides Alien authors with tools to add external non-Perl dependencies to CPAN modules.  It
       is open source software that is entirely volunteer driven, meaning the people writing this software are
       not getting compensated monetarily for the work.  As such, we do our best not to intentionally introduce
       security vulnerabilities into our modules, or their dependencies.  But it is also not our responsibility
       either.  If you are operating in an environment where you need absolute security, you need to carefully
       audit <u>all</u> of the software that you use.

   <b>Alien::Build</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>CPAN</b>
       I suppose you could argue that Alien::Build based Aliens and Aliens in general are inherently less secure
       than the the Perl modules on CPAN that don't download random stuff off the internet.  Worse yet, Aliens
       might be downloading from insecure sources like "http" or "ftp".

       This argument falls apart pretty quickly when you realize that

       1.  Perl  modules  from  CPAN  are  in  fact random stuff off the internet.  Most modules, when installed
           execute a "Makefile.PL" which can execute completely arbitrary Perl code.  Without a proper audit  or
           firewalls  that CPAN code could be making connections to insecure sources like "http" if they are not
           themselves doing something nefarious.

       2.  By default, the most frequently used CPAN client App::cpanminus uses "http" to  fetch  CPAN  modules.
           So  unless you have specifically configured it to connect to a secure source you are downloading even
           more random stuff than usual off the internet.

       The TL;DR is that if you are using a Perl module, whether it be "Foo::PP", "Foo::XS"  or  "Alien::libfoo"
       and you are concerned about security you need to audit all of your Perl modules, not just the Alien ones.

   <b>Restricting</b> <b>Alien::Build</b> <b>by</b> <b>environment</b>
       Okay,  granted you need to audit software for security regardless of if it is Alien, you still don't like
       the idea of downloading external dependencies and you can't firewall just the CPAN module installs.

       Alien::Build based Aliens respect a number of environment variables that at least give you  some  control
       over how aggresive Alien::Build will be at fetching random stuff off the internet.

       "ALIEN_DOWNLOAD_RULE"
           This  environment  variable  configures  how Alien::Build will deal with insecure protocols and files
           that do not include a cryptographic signature.

           Part of the design of the Alien::Build system is that it  typically  tries  to  download  the  latest
           version  of a package instead of a fixed version, so that the Alien doesn't need to be updated when a
           new alienized package is released.  This means that we frequently have to  rely  on  TLS  or  bundled
           alienized packages to ensure that the alienized package is fetched securely.

           Recently  (as  of  Alien::Build  2.59)  we  started  supporting  cryptographic  signatures defined in
           alienfiles, but they are not yet very common, and they only  really  work  when  a  single  alienized
           package  URL is hard coded into the alienfile instead of the more typical mode of operation where the
           latest version is downloaded.

           warn
               This mode will warn you if an Alien::Build based Alien attempts  to  fetch  a  alienized  package
               insecurely.   It will also warn you if a package doesn't have a cryptographic signature.  Neither
               of these things wild stop the Alien from being installed.

               This is unfortunately currently the default mode of Alien::Build, for historical  reasons.   Once
               plugins and Aliens are updated to either use secure fetch (TLS or bundled alienized packages), or
               cryptographic signatures, the default will be changed to "digest_or_encrypt".

           digest_or_encrypt
               This  mode  will  require that before an alienized package is extracted that it is either fetched
               via a secure protocol ("http" or "file"), or the package matches a cryptographic signature.

               This will likely be the default for Alien::Build in the near future, but it doesn't hurt  to  set
               it  now,  if  you don't mind submitting tickets to Aliens or plugins that don't support this mode
               yet.

       "ALIEN_INSTALL_NETWORK"
           By design Aliens should use local installs of libraries and tools before downloading source from  the
           internet.   Setting  this environment variable to false, will instruct Alien::Build to not attempt to
           fetch the alienized package off the internet if it is not available locally or as a bundled package.

           This is similar to setting "ALIEN_INSTALL_TYPE" to "system" (see below), except it does allow  Aliens
           that bundle their alienized package inside the CPAN package tarball.

           Some  Aliens  will  not  install  properly  at  first, but when they error you can install the system
           package and try to re-install the Alien.

       "ALIEN_INSTALL_TYPE"
           Setting "ALIEN_INSTALL_TYPE" to "system" is similar  to  setting  "ALIEN_INSTALL_NETWORK"  to  false,
           except  that  bundled  alienized packages will also be rejected.  This environment variable is really
           intended for use by operating system vendors packaging Aliens, or for Alien developer testing (in  CI
           for example).  For some who want to restrict how Aliens install this might be the right tool to reach
           for.

       Note that this is definitely best effort.  If the Alien author makes a mistake or is malicious they could
       override these environment variables inside the "Makefile.PL", so you still need to audit any software to
       ensure that it doesn't fetch source off the internet.

   <b>Security</b> <b>Related</b> <b>Plugins</b>
       There  are a number of plugins that give the user or installer control over how Alien::Build behaves, and
       may be useful for rudimentary security.

       Alien::Build::Plugin::Fetch::Prompt
           This plugin will prompt before fetching any remote files.   This  only  really  works  when  you  are
           installing Aliens interactively.

       Alien::Build::Plugin::Fetch::HostAllowList
           This plugin will only allow fetching from hosts that are in an allow list.

       Alien::Build::Plugin::Fetch::HostBlockList
           This plugin will not allow fetching from hosts that are in a block list.

       Alien::Build::Plugin::Fetch::Rewrite
           This  plugin  can re-write fetched URLs before the request is made.  This can be useful if you have a
           local mirror of certain sources that you want to use instead of fetching from the wider internet.

       Alien::Build::Plugin::Probe::Override
           This plugin can override the "ALIEN_INSTALL_TYPE" on a perl-Alien basis.  This can be useful  if  you
           want to install some Aliens in "share" mode, but generally want to enforce "system" mode.

   <b>local</b> <b>configuration</b>
       You  can  configure  the  way  Alien::Build  based Aliens are installed with the local configuration file
       "<a href="file:~/.alienbuild/rc.pl">~/.alienbuild/rc.pl</a>".  See Alien::Build::rc for details.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       This whole document is caveats, but if you haven't gotten it by now then, fundamentally if  you  need  to
       use  Perl  modules  securely  then you need to audit the code for security vulnerabilities.  If you think
       that the security of Alien::Build and the Aliens that depend on it, then <u>patches</u> <u>welcome</u>.
