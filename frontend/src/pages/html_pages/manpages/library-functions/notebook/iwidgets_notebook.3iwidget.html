</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Name:           <b>auto</b>
       Class:          <b>Auto</b>
       Command-Line Switch:           <b>-auto</b>

              Specifies  whether  to  use  the automatic packing/unpacking algorithm of the notebook. A value of
              <b>true</b> indicates that page frames will be unpacked and packed acoording to the  algorithm  described
              in  the  <b>select</b>  command.  A value of <b>false</b> leaves the current page packed and subsequent selects,
              next, or previous commands do not switch pages automatically. In either case the page's associated
              command (see the <b>add</b> command's description of the <b>command</b> option) is invoked. The value  may  have
              any of the forms accepted by the <b>Tcl_GetBoolean</b>, such as true, false, 0, 1, yes, or no.

              For  example, if a series of pages in a notebook simply change certain display configurations of a
              graphical display, the <b>-auto</b> flag could be used.  By setting it, the <b>-command</b> procs could  do  the
              appropriate reconfiguring of the page when the page is switched.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>iwidgets::notebook</b> command creates a new window (given by the pathName argument) and makes it into a
       notebook widget. Additional options, described above may be specified on  the  command  line  or  in  the
       option  database  to  configure  aspects  of  the  notebook  such  as  its  colors,  font, and text.  The
       <b>iwidgets::notebook</b> command returns its <u>pathName</u> argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must
       not exist a window named pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.

       A notebook is a widget that contains a set of pages. It displays one page from the set  as  the  selected
       page.  When  a page is selected, the page's contents are displayed in the page area. When first created a
       notebook has no pages. Pages may be added or deleted using widget commands described below.

</pre><h4><b>NOTEBOOK</b> <b>PAGES</b></h4><pre>
       A notebook's pages area contains a single child site <b>frame</b>. When a new page is created it is a  child  of
       this  frame.  The page's child site frame serves as a geometry container for applications to pack widgets
       into. It is this frame that is automatically unpacked or packed  when  the  <b>auto</b>  option  is  <b>true</b>.  This
       creates  the  effect  of  one  page  being visible at a time. When a new page is selected, the previously
       selected page's child site frame is automatically unpacked from the notebook's child site frame  and  the
       newly selected page's child site is packed into the notebook's child site frame.

       However,  sometimes  it is desirable to handle page changes in a different manner. By specifying the <b>auto</b>
       option as <b>false</b>, child site packing can be disabled and done differently. For example, all widgets  might
       be  packed  into the first page's child site frame. Then when a new page is selected, the application can
       reconfigure the widgets and give the appearance that the page was flipped.

       In both cases the <b>command</b> option for a page specifies a Tcl Command to execute when the page is selected.
       In the case of <b>auto</b> being <b>true</b>, it is called between the unpacking of the previously  selected  page  and
       the packing of the newly selected page.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>iwidgets::notebookfR</b>  <b>command</b>  <b>creates</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>Tcl</b> <b>command</b> <b>whose</b> <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <u>pathName</u>. This command may be
       used to invoke various operations on the widget. It has the following general form: <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u>  ?<u>arg</u>
       <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?  <u>option</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.

       Many  of  the  widget  commands  for  a  notebook  take as one argument an indicator of which page of the
       notebook to operate on. These indicators are called indexes and may be specified in any of the  following
       forms:

       <u>number</u> Specifies  the  index  of the the component. For menus, 0 corresponds to the left-most menu of the
              menu bar. For entries, 0 corresponds to the top-most entry of the menu.  <u>number</u> Specifies the page
              numerically, where 0 corresponds to the first page in the notebook, 1 to the second, and so on.

       <b>select</b> Specifies the currently selected page's index. If no page is currently selected, the value  -1  is
              returned.

       <b>end</b>    Specifes the last page in the notebooks's index. If the notebook is empty this will return -1.

       <u>pattern</u>
              If  the  index  doesn't satisfy the form of a number, then this form is used.  Pattern is pattern-
              matched against the <b>label</b> of each page in the notebook, in order from the first to the last  page,
              until a matching entry is found. The rules of <b>Tcl_StringMatch</b> are used.

       ............................................................

       The following commands are possible for notebook widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>add</b> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?
              Add  a  new  page at the end of the notebook. A new child site frame is created. Returns the child
              site pathName. If additional arguments are present, they specify any of the following options:

              <b>-background</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies a background color to use for displaying the child site frame of  this  page.  If
                     this  option  is specified as an empty string (the default), then the background option for
                     the overall notebook is used.

              <b>-command</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies a Tcl command to be  executed  when  this  page  is  selected.  This  allows  the
                     programmer a hook to reconfigure this page's widgets or any other page's widgets.

                     If  the notebook has the auto option set to true, when a page is selected this command will
                     be called immediately after the previously selected page is unpacked and immediately before
                     this page is selected. The index value select is valid  during  this  Tcl  command.  `index
                     select' will return this page's page number.

                     If  the  auto option is set to false, when a page is selected the unpack and pack calls are
                     bypassed. This Tcl command is still called.

              <b>-foreground</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying tab labels when tabs are in their normal
                     unselected state. If this option is specified as an empty string (the  default),  then  the
                     foreground option for the overall notebook is used.

              <b>-label</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies  a  string  to  associate  with  this  page.  This  label serves as an additional
                     identifier used to reference the page. This label may be used for the index value in widget
                     commands.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>childSite</b> ?<u>index</u>?
              If passed no arguments, returns a list of pathNames for all the pages  in  the  notebook.  If  the
              notebook is empty, an empty list is returned

              If  index  is  passed, it returns the pathName for the page's child site frame specified by index.
              Widgets that are created with this  pathName  will  be  displayed  when  the  associated  page  is
              selected. If index is not a valid index, an empty string is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a list
              describing  all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on the
              format of this list). If <u>option</u> is specified with no  <u>value</u>,  then  the  command  returns  a  list
              describing  the  one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the
              value returned if no option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are  specified,  then
              the  command  modifies  the  given  widget  option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
              command  returns  an  empty  string.  <u>Option</u>  may  have  any  of  the  values  accepted   by   the
              <b>iwidgets::notebook</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <u>index1</u> ?index2?
              Delete  all  of  the  pages  between  <u>index1</u>  and  <u>index2</u> inclusive.  If <u>index2</u> is omitted then it
              defaults to <u>index1</u>. Returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>index</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns the numerical index corresponding to <u>index</u>.

       <b>pathName</b> <b>insert</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?
              Insert a new page in the notebook before the page specified by <u>index</u>.  A new child site  <b>frame</b>  is
              created. See the <b>add</b> command for valid options. Returns the child site pathName.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>next</b>
              Advances  the  selected  page  to  the  next page (order is determined by insertion order). If the
              currently selected page is the last page in the notebook, the selection wraps around to the  first
              page in the notebook.

              For  notebooks with auto set to true the current page's child site is unpacked from the notebook's
              child site frame. Then the next page's child site is packed into the notebooks child  site  frame.
              The Tcl command given with the command option will be invoked between these two operations.

              For  notebooks  with  auto  set  to  false  the  Tcl command given with the command option will be
              invoked.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>pagecget</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>option</u>?
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u> for the  page  specified  by
              <u>index</u>. The valid available options are the same as available to the <b>add</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>pageconfigure</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> ...?
              This  command  is  similar  to the configure command, except that it applies to the options for an
              individual page, whereas configure applies to the options for the notebook. Options may  have  any
              of  the  values accepted by the add widget command. If options are specified, options are modified
              as indicated in the command and the command returns an empty string. If no options are  specified,
              returns a list describing the current options for page <u>index</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information
              on the format of this list).

       <u>pathName</u> <b>prev</b>
              Moves  the  selected  page  to  the previous page (order is determined by insertion order). If the
              currently selected page is the first page in the notebook, the selection wraps around to the  last
              page in the notebook.

              For  notebooks with <b>auto</b> set to <b>true</b> the current page's child site is unpacked from the notebook's
              child site frame. Then the previous page's child site is packed  into  the  notebooks  child  site
              frame. The Tcl command given with the command option will be invoked between these two operations.

              For  notebooks  with  <b>auto</b>  set  to  <b>false</b>  the  Tcl command given with the command option will be
              invoked.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>select</b> <u>index</u>
              Selects the page specified by <u>index</u> as the currently selected page.

              For notebooks with <b>auto</b> set to <b>true</b> the current page's child site is unpacked from the  notebook's
              child  site frame. Then the index page's child site is packed into the notebooks child site frame.
              The Tcl command given with the command option will be invoked between these two operations.

              For notebooks with <b>auto</b> set to <b>false</b> the Tcl  command  given  with  the  command  option  will  be
              invoked.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>view</b>
              Returns the currently selected page. This command is for compatibility with the scrollbar widget.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>view</b> <u>index</u>
              Selects  the  page  specified  by  <u>index</u>  as  the  currently  selected  page.  This command is for
              compatibility with the scrollbar widget.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>view</b> <u>moveto</u> <u>fraction</u>
              Uses the fraction value to determine the corresponding page to  move  to.   This  command  is  for
              compatibility with the scrollbar widget.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>view</b> <u>scroll</u> <u>num</u> <u>what</u>
              Uses the <u>num</u> value to determine how many pages to move forward or backward (num can be negative or
              positive).  The  <u>what</u>  argument  is  ignored. This command is for compatibility with the scrollbar
              widget.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Following is an example that creates a notebook with two pages. In  this  example,  we  use  a  scrollbar
       widget to control the notebook widget.

              package require Iwidgets 4.0
              # Create the notebook widget and pack it.
                iwidgets::notebook .nb -width 100 -height 100
                pack .nb -anchor nw \
                      -fill both \
                      -expand yes \
                      -side left \
                      -padx 10 \
                      -pady 10

              # Add two pages to the notebook, labelled
              # "Page One" and "Page Two", respectively.
                .nb add -label "Page One"
                .nb add -label "Page Two"

              # Get the child site frames of these two pages.
                set page1CS [.nb childsite 0]
                set page2CS [.nb childsite "Page Two"]

              # Create buttons on each page of the notebook
                button $page1CS.b -text "Button One"
                pack $page1CS.b
                button $page2CS.b -text "Button Two"
                pack $page2CS.b

              # Select the first page of the notebook
                .nb select 0

              # Create the scrollbar and associate teh scrollbar
              # and the notebook together, then pack the scrollbar
                scrollbar .scroll -command ".nb view"
                .nb configure -scrollcommand ".scroll set"
                pack .scroll -fill y -expand yes -pady 10
