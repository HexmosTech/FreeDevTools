       <b>XmNotebook</b> — The Notebook widget class "XmNotebook" "widget class" "Notebook"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;Xm/Notebook.h&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Notebook  is  a  manager  widget  that  organizes  its  children into pages, tabs, status areas, and page
       scrollers to simulate a real notebook. It stacks its page children so that all page children  occupy  the
       same  area  like real book pages.  Notebook displays visuals that look like the binding of a book and the
       edges of other pages around the page that is shown.  Tab children  simulate  notebook  tabs.  Major  tabs
       divide  Notebook  into  several  sections,  and minor tabs subdivide these sections. Status area children
       provide additional information about pages such as page numbers. The page scroller child allows the  user
       to  move from page to page. Notebook also provides tab scrollers for scrolling major and minor tabs if it
       cannot display all tabs within its edges.

       The application creates pages, tabs, status areas, and page scroller as children of the Notebook  widget.
       Notebook creates tab scrollers when the Notebook is created.

       The  <b>XmNnotebookChildType</b>  constraint  resource  of Notebook determines whether a child widget is a page,
       tab, status area, or page scroller. Any Motif widget can be a page of the Notebook.  When the application
       creates a child of the Notebook widget without setting the child type constraint,  the  child  becomes  a
       page  by default, unless it has the <b>XmQTactivatable</b>, <b>XmQTaccessTextual</b>, or <b>XmQTnavigator</b> trait.  Children
       with the <b>XmQTactivatable</b>, <b>XmQTaccessTextual</b>, or <b>XmQTnavigator</b> trait become major tabs, status areas,  and
       page scrollers, respectively.

       Notebook  uses  the  <b>XmQTaccessTextual</b>,  <b>XmQTactivatable</b>,  <b>XmQTjoinSide</b>,  and  <b>XmQTnavigator</b>  traits, and
       installs the <b>XmQTscrollFrame</b> trait.

       The application attaches a tab to a page by creating  a  tab  child  of  the  Notebook  and  setting  the
       <b>XmNpageNumber</b>  constraint  to  the  page  number  of the targeted page. By the same method, a status area
       widget can be attached to a page. The page scroller child, on the other  hand,  is  associated  with  the
       Notebook, not with a specific page. Therefore, there is only one valid page scroller for each Notebook.

   <b>Pages</b>
       Only  one  child  of type <b>XmPAGE</b> is displayed at a time by Notebook.  Other page children are hidden off-
       screen. When Notebook displays a particular page, it positions the previously-displayed  page  off-screen
       and  puts  the  new  page  in its place. The page is resized to fit into the dimensions that Notebook has
       allocated to display pages.

   <b>Page</b> <b>Numbers</b>
       Notebook uses the <b>XmNcurrentPageNumber</b>, <b>XmNfirstPageNumber</b>, and <b>XmNlastPageNumber</b> resources to  determine
       the  current  page  and  available  page number range. Only those pages whose page numbers are within the
       range can be displayed. Other pages cannot be displayed until the range  between  <b>XmNfirstPageNumber</b>  and
       <b>XmNlastPageNumber</b>  is  changed  to  include them or their page numbers are changed to a number within the
       range.

       If <b>XmNfirstPageNumber</b> and <b>XmNlastPageNumber</b> are not set explicitly by the application, they are set to  1
       by  default;  Notebook  sets  <b>XmNlastPageNumber</b>  to  the  largest page number assigned by the application
       thereafter by default. However, once <b>XmNlastPageNumber</b> is set by  the  application,  Notebook  no  longer
       changes it even when a page with a higher page number is managed.

       The  <b>XmNpageNumber</b> constraint resource is used for specifying the page number of a page widget. It can be
       set to any integer. For tab and status area children, the resource is used for linking the  child  widget
       to a page.  For the page scroller child, the resource has no meaning and is ignored by the Notebook.

       When  a  page  without a page number is managed, Notebook assigns it the smallest unallocated page number
       that is not less than the first page number and greater than the last allocated page number. When  a  tab
       or  a  status area without a page number is managed, the newly managed widget is assigned the page number
       of the most recently managed page, unless the page already has the same type of child. If the  page  does
       have the same type of child, Notebook assigns the newly managed widget a page number one greater than the
       most  recently  managed page; this new page number is now occupied.  Notebook may generate a default page
       number greater than <b>XmNlastPageNumber</b>, making those pages inaccessible to the user.

   <b>Duplicate</b> <b>and</b> <b>Empty</b> <b>Pages</b>
       Since an application can create or change page numbers, it is possible to have duplicate page numbers and
       empty pages. When two pages with the same page number are managed, only the more  recently  managed  page
       can  be  displayed.  Inserting a page with an existing page number does not cause a warning. The old page
       widget cannot be displayed until the new page widget is removed from  the  Notebook  or  until  the  page
       number of the old page widget is changed to some other number.

       An  empty  page  is a page slot where no page is inserted. Empty pages occur when a tab or status area is
       associated with a page number that has no matching page widget.  Empty pages display the  blank  Notebook
       background  unless  the  application  provides  visual  information  to  this empty area while processing
       <b>XmNpageChangedCallback</b>.

   <b>Notebook</b> <b>Visuals</b>
       Notebook draws lines around two sides of the top page to simulate the  edges  of  other  pages  that  are
       behind  the  top  page.   The <b>XmNbackPagePlacement</b> and <b>XmNorientation</b> resources determine which two sides
       have the lines drawn around them. By default, they are drawn on the bottom and right  sides  of  the  top
       page.  The  application  can set resources to control how many lines are drawn and how wide the area that
       they are drawn in is. Applications can also choose from three styles of binding visual that simulates the
       binding of a Notebook. Solid or spiral bindings can be drawn by Notebook, or the application can supply a
       pixmap that is tiled into the binding.

   <b>Tabs</b>
       A major or minor tab is a Motif widget with the <b>XmQTactivatable</b> trait.  If a widget without the trait  is
       created  for a tab, Notebook does not provide the page activation callback.  As a result, even though the
       tab is displayed, it cannot automatically move the associated page to the top.

       Major tabs divide the Notebook pages into sections. Minor tabs subdivide these sections.  Only minor tabs
       associated with the current section are displayed, where a section consists of the group of pages between
       the current major tab and the next major tab, including the current major tab but not including the  page
       containing  the  next major tab.  The exception to this is when there is no preceding major tab, in which
       case the section starts from the <b>XmNfirstPageNumber</b> value.  A user in one major tab section does not  see
       the minor tabs in other sections.  However, all tabs are used in computing the size of the Notebook.

       Unlike  regular  notebook tabs, tabs in the Notebook are not attached to a physical page (a widget). They
       are, instead, attached to a logical page (a page number). Therefore, it is possible to have a tab with an
       empty page. When a page with a tab is removed from the Notebook, the tab is not  removed  because  it  is
       still bound to a logical page.  Destroying or unmanaging a page widget only erases the page and leaves an
       empty  page.   It  does  not  tear  the page out of the Notebook. To remove the tab, the application must
       explicitly destroy or unmanage it.

       Notebook supports the <b>XmQTjoinSide</b> trait. A widget that has the <b>XmQTjoinSide</b> trait can be  added  to  the
       Notebook as a Major or Minor tab and will appear to be attached to its associated page with no margins or
       shadows between them.

   <b>Status</b> <b>Areas</b>
       A  status  area  is  any  widget  that is used for describing the associated page. For example, the Label
       widget as a status area child can hold a simple string or a pixmap that describes a page. A  status  area
       widget  is  also attached to a page by the page number constraint resource.  Therefore, it is possible to
       have multiple status area widgets for one page.  Only the most recently managed status  area  widget  for
       that  page  can  be  displayed.  All others for that page are not unmanaged, but their sizes are used for
       computing the size of the Notebook. If no status area widget is provided, the Notebook displays its blank
       background in the status area's reserved space. Notebook does not create any default status area widget.

   <b>Page</b> <b>Scrollers</b>
       The page scroller of the Notebook is any widget that the application creates for scrolling pages. If  the
       application  does  not create one when the Notebook is realized, Notebook creates a SpinBox widget as the
       default page scroller.  If the application creates a new page scroller,  the  default  page  scroller  is
       destroyed.  If the application creates multiple page scrollers, only the most recently managed one can be
       displayed and used. All others are unmanaged.

       The default SpinBox page scroller grays out one of the arrow visuals if the current page  is  a  boundary
       page.  If the current page is the first page, the previous arrow of the SpinBox is grayed. If the current
       page is the last page, the next arrow of the SpinBox is grayed.

   <b>Tab</b> <b>Scrollers</b>
       Tab  scrollers  are  created  by  the  Notebook for scrolling major tabs and minor tabs. When Notebook is
       initialized, it creates four ArrowButtonGadgets for scrolling to the next major tab, the  previous  major
       tab, the next minor tab, and the previous minor tab.  The application cannot replace these tab scrollers.
       The  application  can  change all resources of these widgets except the position and the arrow direction.
       Tab scrollers are only visible and enabled when there is not enough space to display  all  the  major  or
       minor  tabs  appropriate  to the page. Tab scrollers are also grayed out when scrolling is inappropriate.
       The following lists the tab scrollers that are created:
