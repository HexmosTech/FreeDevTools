       DBM::Deep::Iterator::BucketList - mediate between DBM::Deep::Iterator and
       DBM::Deep::Engine::Sector::BucketList

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       This is an internal-use-only object for DBM::Deep. It acts as the mediator between the
       DBM::Deep::Iterator object and a DBM::Deep::Engine::Sector::BucketList sector.

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       This object, despite the implied class hierarchy, does <b>NOT</b> inherit from DBM::Deep::Iterator. Instead, it
       delegates to it, essentially acting as a facade over it. "get_next_key" in DBM::Deep::Iterator will
       instantiate one of these objects as needed to handle an BucketList sector.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new(\%params)</b>
       The constructor takes a hashref of params and blesses it into the invoking class. The hashref is assumed
       to have the following elements:

       •   iterator (of type DBM::Deep::Iterator

       •   sector (of type DBM::Deep::Engine::Sector::BucketList

   <b>at_end()</b>
       This takes no arguments.

       This returns true/false indicating whether this sector has any more elements that can be iterated over.

   <b>get_next_iterator()</b>
       This takes no arguments.

       This returns the next key pointed to by this bucketlist. This value is suitable for returning by FIRSTKEY
       or <b>NEXTKEY()</b>.

       If the bucketlist is exhausted, it returns nothing.
