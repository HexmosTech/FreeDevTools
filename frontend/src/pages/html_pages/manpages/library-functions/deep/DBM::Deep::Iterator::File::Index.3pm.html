       DBM::Deep::Iterator::Index - mediate between DBM::Deep::Iterator and DBM::Deep::Engine::Sector::Index

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       This is an internal-use-only object for DBM::Deep. It acts as the mediator between the
       DBM::Deep::Iterator object and a DBM::Deep::Engine::Sector::Index sector.

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       This object, despite the implied class hierarchy, does <b>NOT</b> inherit from DBM::Deep::Iterator. Instead, it
       delegates to it, essentially acting as a facade over it. "get_next_key" in DBM::Deep::Iterator will
       instantiate one of these objects as needed to handle an Index sector.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new(\%params)</b>
       The constructor takes a hashref of params and blesses it into the invoking class. The hashref is assumed
       to have the following elements:

       •   iterator (of type DBM::Deep::Iterator

       •   sector (of type DBM::Deep::Engine::Sector::Index

   <b>at_end()</b>
       This takes no arguments.

       This returns true/false indicating whether this sector has any more elements that can be iterated over.

   <b>get_next_iterator()</b>
       This takes no arguments.

       This  returns  an  iterator  (built  by "get_sector_iterator" in DBM::Deep::Iterator) based on the sector
       pointed to by the next occupied location in this index.

       If the sector is exhausted, it returns nothing.
