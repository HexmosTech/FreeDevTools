</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Authorization::Driver::Generic - Generic Authorization driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use base qw(CGI::Application);
        use CGI::Application::Plugin::Authorization;

        my %groupmap = (
            testuser =&gt; 'testgroup',
        );

        # See docs for authorize_user below for an explanation
        __PACKAGE__-&gt;authz-&gt;config(
            DRIVER =&gt; [ 'Generic', sub {
               my ($username,$group) = @_;
               return ($groupmap{$username} eq $group);
            } ],
        );

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>authorize_user</b>
       This method accepts a username followed by a list of group names and will return true if the user belongs
       to at least one of the groups.

       It does this by calling the provided callback with the username and a single group until a match is
       found.
