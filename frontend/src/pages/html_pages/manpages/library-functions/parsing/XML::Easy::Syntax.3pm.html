       XML::Easy::Syntax - excruciatingly correct XML syntax

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use XML::Easy::Syntax qw($xml10_name_rx);
           if($name =~ /\A$xml10_name_rx\z/o) { ...
           # and many other regular expressions

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module supplies Perl regular expressions describing the grammar of XML 1.0.  This is intended to
       support doing irregular things with XML, rather than for normal parsing.

       These regular expressions encompass the entire XML grammar except for document type declarations and
       DTDs.  This document assumes general familiarity with XML.

</pre><h4><b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Each of these regular expressions corresponds precisely to one of the productions in the EBNF grammar in
       the XML 1.0 specification.  Well-formedness constraints that are not expressed in the EBNF are <u>not</u>
       checked by the regular expressions; these are noted in the documentation below.  The regular expressions
       do not include any anchors, so to check whether an entire string matches a production you must supply the
       anchors yourself.

   <b>Syntax</b> <b>pieces</b>
       $xml10_char_rx
           Any  single  character  that  is acceptable to XML 1.0.  This includes most Unicode characters (up to
           codepoint 0x10ffff).  The excluded codepoints are the sentinels  0xfffe  and  0xffff,  the  surrogate
           blocks,  and  most  of  the  C0  control  characters  (0x00  to  0x1f,  except  for  0x09 (tab), 0x0a
           (linefeed/newline), and 0x0d (carriage return)).

           It is a rule of XML that all characters making up an XML document must be in this permitted set.  The
           grammar productions can only match sequences of acceptable characters.  This rule is enforced by  the
           regular expressions in this module.

           Furthermore,  it  is  a  rule that the character data in a document cannot even <u>represent</u> a character
           outside the  permitted  set.   This  is  expressed  as  a  well-formedness  constraint  on  character
           references.

       $xml10_s_rx
           Any  sequence  of  one or more acceptable whitespace characters.  The whitespace characters, for this
           purpose, are tab, linefeed/newline, carriage return, and space.  Non-ASCII whitespace characters, and
           the more exotic ASCII whitespace characters, do not qualify.

       $xml10_eq_rx
           Equals sign, surrounded by optional whitespace.

   <b>Names</b>
       $xml10_namestartchar_rx
           Any single character that is permitted at the start of a name.  The  permitted  characters  are  "<b>_</b>",
           "<b>:</b>", and letters (categorised according to Unicode 2.0).

           This production is not named in the XML specification.

       $xml10_namechar_rx
           Any  single  character that is permitted in a name other than at the start.  The permitted characters
           are "<b>.</b>", "<b>-</b>", "<b>_</b>", "<b>:</b>",  and  letters,  digits,  combining  characters,  and  extenders  (categorised
           according to Unicode 2.0).

       $xml10_name_rx
           A name, of the type used to identify element types, attributes, entities, and other things in XML.

       $xml10_names_rx
           A space-separated list of one or more names.

       $xml10_nmtoken_rx
           A  name-like  token,  much like a name except that the first character is no more restricted than the
           remaining characters.  These tokens play no part in basic XML syntax, and in  the  specification  are
           only used as part of attribute typing.

       $xml10_nmtokens_rx
           A space-separated list of one or more name-like tokens.

   <b>References</b>
       $xml10_charref_rx
           A  numeric  character  reference (beginning with "<b>&amp;#</b>" and ending with "<b>;</b>").  There is a non-syntactic
           well-formedness constraint: the codepoint is required to be within the Unicode range and to refer  to
           an acceptable character (as discussed at $xml10_char_rx).

       $xml10_entityref_rx
           A  general  entity reference (beginning with "<b>&amp;</b>" and ending with "<b>;</b>").  There are non-syntactic well-
           formedness constraints: the referenced entity must be declared (possibly implicitly), must not be  an
           unparsed  entity,  must  not  contain  a recursive reference to itself, and its replacement text must
           itself be well-formed.

       $xml10_reference_rx
           Either a character reference or  an  entity  reference.   The  well-formedness  constraints  of  both
           reference types (see above) apply.

   <b>Character</b> <b>data</b>
       $xml10_chardata_rx
           Ordinary literal character data.  This consists of zero or more acceptable characters, other than the
           metacharacters  "<b>&lt;</b>"  and  "<b>&amp;</b>", and not including "<b>]]&gt;</b>" as a subsequence.  Such data stands for itself
           when it appears between the start and end tags of an element,  where  it  can  be  interspersed  with
           references, CDATA sections, comments, and processing instructions.

           In  the  XML  grammar,  character  data  is parsed, and taken literally, <u>after</u> line endings have been
           canonicalised (to the newline character).  Pre-canonicalisation character data,  with  variable  line
           endings, will still match this production but should not be interpreted literally.

           Beware  that a string that does not match this production might parse as two adjacent strings each of
           which matches.  This can happen because of the prohibition on "<b>]]&gt;</b>" being embedded in character data,
           while the characters of that sequence are acceptable individually.  The XML grammar  does  not  allow
           two instances of this production to abut.

       $xml10_cdata_rx
           Literal  character data in a CDATA section.  This consists of zero or more acceptable characters, not
           including "<b>]]&gt;</b>" as a subsequence.  Unlike ordinary literal character data, the characters "<b>&lt;</b>" and "<b>&amp;</b>"
           are not metacharacters here.  Such data stands for itself when it appears within a CDATA section.

           As with ordinary literal character data (see above), this data is meant to be  taken  literally  only
           after  line  endings  have  been  canonicalised.   Also, as with ordinary literal character data, two
           instances of this production should not abut.

       $xml10_cdstart_rx
       $xml10_cdend_rx
           The fixed strings "<b>&lt;![CDATA[</b>" and "<b>]]&gt;</b>" which begin and finish a CDATA section.

       $xml10_cdsect_rx
           A CDATA section.  This consists of "<b>&lt;![CDATA[</b>", literal character data with metacharacters  disabled,
           and "<b>]]&gt;</b>".

   <b>Tags</b>
       $xml10_attvalue_rx
           A  quoted attribute value.  This consists of acceptable characters other than "<b>&lt;</b>", "<b>&amp;</b>", and the quote
           character, interspersed with references, surrounded  by  matching  "<b>"</b>"  or  "<b>'</b>"  quotes.   The  well-
           formedness  constraints  of references apply, and additionally the replacement text of any referenced
           entities must not contain any "<b>&lt;</b>" characters, and it is not permitted to refer to external entities.

       $xml10_attribute_rx
           A complete attribute, consisting of  name,  equals  sign,  and  quoted  value.   The  well-formedness
           constraints of attribute values (pertaining to references) apply.

       $xml10_stag_rx
           A  start-tag,  used  to  begin  an element.  This consists of "<b>&lt;</b>", the element type name, whitespace-
           separated list  of  attributes,  and  "<b>&gt;</b>".   The  well-formedness  constraints  of  attribute  values
           (pertaining  to  references)  apply.  There is also a well-formedness constraint that attribute names
           must be unique within the tag.

       $xml10_etag_rx
           An end-tag, used to finish an element.  This consists of "<b>&lt;/</b>", the element type name, and "<b>&gt;</b>".

       $xml10_emptyelemtag_rx
           An empty-element tag, used to represent an element with  no  content.   This  consists  of  "<b>&lt;</b>",  the
           element   type  name,  whitespace-separated  list  of  attributes,  and  "<b>/&gt;</b>".   The  well-formedness
           constraints of attribute values (pertaining to references) apply.  There is  also  a  well-formedness
           constraint  that  attribute  names must be unique within the tag.  (These are the same constraints as
           for start-tags.)

   <b>Non-data</b> <b>content</b>
       $xml10_comment_rx
           A comment.  This does not contribute to the data content of an XML document.  It consists of  "<b>&lt;!--</b>",
           zero  or  more acceptable characters, and "<b>--&gt;</b>".  It is not permitted for the content to include "<b>--</b>"
           as a subsequence, nor for it to end with "<b>-</b>".

       $xml10_pitarget_rx
           A processing instruction target name.  This can be any name (the  $xml10_name_rx  production)  except
           for "<b>xml</b>" and its case variations.

       $xml10_pi_rx
           A processing instruction.  This consists of "<b>&lt;?</b>", a target name, some content which can be almost any
           sequence  of  acceptable  characters,  and "<b>?&gt;</b>".  A processing instruction does not contribute to the
           data content of an XML document, but is intended to carry metadata regarding how to process it.   The
           instruction  is  addressed  to  a  particular  XML processor, or type of processor, identified by the
           target name, and the content of the instruction is expected to be meaningful only to its target.

           No one has ever come up with a good use for processing instructions.  They are best shunned.

   <b>Recursive</b> <b>structure</b>
       $xml10_content_rx
           The matter contained within an element  (between  its  start-tag  and  end-tag).   This  consists  of
           stretches  of  ordinary  literal  character  data, interspersed with complete elements (recursively),
           references, CDATA sections, processing instructions, and comments, in any order.  The well-formedness
           constraints of references and elements apply.

       $xml10_element_rx
           A complete element.  This is either an empty-element tag, or a sequence of  start-tag,  content,  and
           end-tag.   The well-formedness constraints regarding references and attribute uniqueness apply in the
           empty-element tag or start-tag.   In  the  non-empty  form,  the  content  also  has  well-formedness
           constraints  regarding  references  and  (recursively) contained elements, and there is an additional
           constraint that the element type name in the end-tag must match that in the start-tag.

   <b>XML</b> <b>declarations</b>
       $xml10_versionnum_rx
           The version number of the XML specification.  This is the fixed string "<b>1.0</b>".

       $xml10_versioninfo_rx
           The version declaration part of an XML declaration.

       $xml10_encname_rx
           A character encoding name.  This must start with an ASCII letter, and contain only ASCII letters  and
           digits and "<b>.</b>", "<b>_</b>", and "<b>-</b>".

       $xml10_encodingdecl_rx
           The encoding declaration part of an XML declaration.

       $xml10_sddecl_rx
           The  standaloneness  declaration part of an XML declaration.  This indicates whether the XML document
           can be correctly interpreted without examining the external part of the DTD.

       $xml10_xmldecl_rx
           An XML declaration, as used at the start of an XML document.  This  consists  of  "<b>&lt;?xml</b>",  mandatory
           version declaration, optional encoding declaration, optional standaloneness declaration, and "<b>?&gt;</b>".

       $xml10_textdecl_rx
           A  text  declaration,  as  used  at the start of an XML external parsed entity or external DTD.  This
           consists of "<b>&lt;?xml</b>", optional version declaration, mandatory encoding declaration, and "<b>?&gt;</b>".  This is
           very similar to an  XML  declaration,  but  technically  a  different  item  and  used  in  different
           situations.   It  is  possible, and useful, to construct a declaration which is acceptable both as an
           XML declaration and as a text declaration.

   <b>Document</b> <b>structure</b>
       $xml10_misc_rx
           Non-content item permitted in the prologue and epilogue of a document.  This is either a  comment,  a
           processing instruction, or a stretch of whitespace.

           Beware  in  using  a  pattern  such  as  "$xml10_misc_rx*".   It  could  match a string of whitespace
           characters in many ways, leading to exponential behaviour if it becomes necessary to backtrack.  This
           can be avoided by using the $xml10_miscseq_rx pattern (below).

       $xml10_miscseq_rx
           A sequence (possibly empty) of non-content matter  permitted  in  the  prologue  and  epilogue  of  a
           document.  This can contain comments, processing instructions, and whitespace, in any order.

           This  production  is not named in the XML specification.  This regular expression should be preferred
           over "$xml10_misc_rx*" (which is the direct translation of what appears in  the  XML  specification),
           because this one guarantees to match a particular text in only one way, and is thus able to backtrack
           cleanly.

       $xml10_prolog_xdtd_rx
           Document  prologue,  except  for  not  permitting  a  document type declaration.  This consists of an
           optional XML  declaration  followed  by  any  sequence  of  comments,  processing  instructions,  and
           whitespace.

       $xml10_document_xdtd_rx
           A  complete  XML document, except for not permitting a document type declaration.  This consists of a
           non-content prologue, an element (the root element, which can recursively  contain  other  elements),
           and a non-content epilogue.  The well-formedness constraints of elements apply to the root element.

       $xml10_extparsedent_rx
           A  complete  external  parsed  entity.   This  consists of an optional text declaration followed by a
           sequence of content of the same type that  is  permitted  within  an  element.   The  well-formedness
           constraints of element content apply.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Many of these regular expressions are liable to tickle a serious bug in perl's regexp engine.  The bug is
       that  the  "*"  and "+" repeat operators don't always match an unlimited number of repeats: in some cases
       they are limited to 32767 iterations.  Whether this bogus limit applies depends on the complexity of  the
       expression  being  repeated,  whether  the  string being examined is internally encoded in UTF-8, and the
       version of perl.  In some cases, but not all, a false match failure is preceded  by  a  warning  "Complex
       regular subexpression recursion limit (32766) exceeded".

       This  bug  is  present, in various forms, in all perl versions up to at least 5.8.9 and 5.10.0.  Pre-5.10
       perls may also overflow their stack space, in similar circumstances, if a resource limit is imposed.

       There is no known feasible workaround for this perl bug.  The regular expressions supplied by this module
       will therefore, unavoidably, fail to accept some lengthy valid inputs.  Where this occurs, though, it  is
       likely  that  other  regular  expressions being applied to the same or related input will also suffer the
       same problem.  It is pervasive.  Do not rely on this module (or perl) to process long inputs on  affected
       perl versions.

       This bug does not affect the XML::Easy::Text parser.
