         use XML::LibXML '1.70';

         # Parser constructor

         $parser = XML::LibXML-&gt;new();

</pre><h4><b>PARSING</b></h4><pre>
       An XML document is read into a data structure such as a DOM tree by a piece of software, called a parser.
       XML::LibXML currently provides four different parser interfaces:

       •   A DOM Pull-Parser

       •   A DOM Push-Parser

       •   A SAX Parser

       •   A DOM based SAX Parser.

   <b>Creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>Parser</b> <b>Instance</b>
       XML::LibXML  provides  an  OO interface to the libxml2 parser functions. Thus you have to create a parser
       instance before you can parse any XML data.

       new
             $parser = XML::LibXML-&gt;new();
             $parser = XML::LibXML-&gt;new(option=&gt;value, ...);
             $parser = XML::LibXML-&gt;new({option=&gt;value, ...});

           Create a new XML and HTML parser instance. Each parser instance  holds  default  values  for  various
           parser options. Optionally, one can pass a hash reference or a list of option =&gt; value pairs to set a
           different  default  set  of  options.   Unless  specified  otherwise, the options "load_ext_dtd", and
           "expand_entities" are set to 1. See "Parser Options" for a list of libxml2 parser's options.

   <b>DOM</b> <b>Parser</b>
       One of the common parser interfaces of XML::LibXML is the DOM parser. This parser reads XML data  into  a
       DOM like data structure, so each tag can get accessed and transformed.

       XML::LibXML's  DOM  parser is not only capable to parse XML data, but also (strict) HTML files. There are
       three ways to parse documents - as a string, as a Perl filehandle, or as a filename/URL. The return value
       from each is a XML::LibXML::Document object, which is a DOM object.

       All of the functions listed below will throw an exception if the document is  invalid.  To  prevent  this
       causing your program exiting, wrap the call in an eval{} block

       load_xml
             $dom = XML::LibXML-&gt;load_xml(
                 location =&gt; $file_or_url
                 # parser options ...
               );
             $dom = XML::LibXML-&gt;load_xml(
                 string =&gt; $xml_string
                 # parser options ...
               );
             $dom = XML::LibXML-&gt;load_xml(
                 string =&gt; (\$xml_string)
                 # parser options ...
               );
             $dom = XML::LibXML-&gt;load_xml({
                 IO =&gt; $perl_file_handle
                 # parser options ...
               );
             $dom = $parser-&gt;load_xml(...);

           This  function  is  available  since  XML::LibXML  1.70. It provides easy to use interface to the XML
           parser that parses given file (or non-HTTPS URL),  string,  or  input  stream  to  a  DOM  tree.  The
           arguments  can be passed in a HASH reference or as name =&gt; value pairs. The function can be called as
           a class method or an object method. In both cases it internally creates a new parser instance passing
           the specified parser options;  if  called  as  an  object  method,  it  clones  the  original  parser
           (preserving  its  settings) and additionally applies the specified options to the new parser. See the
           constructor "new" and "Parser Options" for more information.

           Note that, due to a limitation in the underlying libxml2 library, this call does not recognize HTTPS-
           based URLs. (It will treat an HTTPS URL as a filename, likely throwing a "No such file or  directory"
           exception.)

       load_html
             $dom = XML::LibXML-&gt;load_html(...);
             $dom = $parser-&gt;load_html(...);

           This  function  is  available  since XML::LibXML 1.70. It has the same usage as "load_xml", providing
           interface to the HTML parser. See "load_xml" for more information.

       Parsing HTML may cause problems, especially if the ampersand ('&amp;') is used.  This is a common problem  if
       HTML  code  is parsed that contains links to CGI-scripts. Such links cause the parser to throw errors. In
       such cases libxml2 still parses the entire  document  as  there  was  no  error,  but  the  error  causes
       XML::LibXML  to  stop the parsing process. However, the document is not lost.  Such HTML documents should
       be parsed using the <u>recover</u> flag. By default recovering is deactivated.

       The functions described above are implemented to parse well formed documents.  In some  cases  a  program
       gets  well  balanced  XML  instead  of well formed documents (e.g. an XML fragment from a database). With
       XML::LibXML it is not required to wrap such fragments in the code, because XML::LibXML is capable even to
       parse well balanced XML fragments.

       parse_balanced_chunk
             $fragment = $parser-&gt;parse_balanced_chunk( $wbxmlstring, $encoding );

           This function parses a well balanced XML  string  into  a  XML::LibXML::DocumentFragment.  The  first
           arguments  contains  the  input string, the optional second argument can be used to specify character
           encoding of the input (UTF-8 is assumed by default).

       parse_xml_chunk
           This is the old name of <b>parse_balanced_chunk()</b>. Because it may causes confusion with the push  parser
           interface, this function should not be used anymore.

       By default XML::LibXML does not process XInclude tags within an XML Document (see options section below).
       XML::LibXML allows one to post-process a document to expand XInclude tags.

       process_xincludes
             $parser-&gt;process_xincludes( $doc );

           After  a document is parsed into a DOM structure, you may want to expand the documents XInclude tags.
           This function processes the given document structure and expands all  XInclude  tags  (or  throws  an
           error) by using the flags and callbacks of the given parser instance.

           Note   that   the   resulting  Tree  contains  some  extra  nodes  (of  type  XML_XINCLUDE_START  and
           XML_XINCLUDE_END) after successfully processing the document. These nodes  indicate  where  data  was
           included into the original tree.  if the document is serialized, these extra nodes will not show up.

           Remember: A Document with processed XIncludes differs from the original document after serialization,
           because the original XInclude tags will not get restored!

           If the parser flag "expand_xincludes" is set to 1, you need not to post process the parsed document.

       processXIncludes
             $parser-&gt;processXIncludes( $doc );

           This is an alias to process_xincludes, but through a JAVA like function name.

       parse_file
             $doc = $parser-&gt;parse_file( $xmlfilename );

           This function parses an XML document from a file or network; $xmlfilename can be either a filename or
           a  (non-HTTPS) URL. Note that for parsing files, this function is the fastest choice, about 6-8 times
           faster then <b>parse_fh()</b>.

       parse_fh
             $doc = $parser-&gt;parse_fh( $io_fh );

           <b>parse_fh()</b> parses a IOREF or a subclass of IO::Handle.

           Because the data comes from an open handle, libxml2's parser does not know about the base URI of  the
           document. To set the base URI one should use <b>parse_fh()</b> as follows:

             my $doc = $parser-&gt;parse_fh( $io_fh, $baseuri );

       parse_string
             $doc = $parser-&gt;parse_string( $xmlstring);

           This  function  is similar to <b>parse_fh()</b>, but it parses an XML document that is available as a single
           string in memory, or alternatively as a reference to a scalar containing a  string.  Again,  you  can
           pass an optional base URI to the function.

             my $doc = $parser-&gt;parse_string( $xmlstring, $baseuri );
             my $doc = $parser-&gt;parse_string(\$xmlstring, $baseuri);

       parse_html_file
             $doc = $parser-&gt;parse_html_file( $htmlfile, \%opts );

           Similar  to <b>parse_file()</b> but parses HTML (strict) documents; $htmlfile can be filename or (non-HTTPS)
           URL.

           An optional second argument can be used to pass some options to the HTML parser as a HASH  reference.
           See options labeled with HTML in "Parser Options".

       parse_html_fh
             $doc = $parser-&gt;parse_html_fh( $io_fh, \%opts );

           Similar to <b>parse_fh()</b> but parses HTML (strict) streams.

           An  optional second argument can be used to pass some options to the HTML parser as a HASH reference.
           See options labeled with HTML in "Parser Options".

           Note: encoding option may not work correctly with this function in libxml2 &lt; 2.6.27 if the HTML  file
           declares charset using a META tag.

       parse_html_string
             $doc = $parser-&gt;parse_html_string( $htmlstring, \%opts );

           Similar to <b>parse_string()</b> but parses HTML (strict) strings.

           An  optional second argument can be used to pass some options to the HTML parser as a HASH reference.
           See options labeled with HTML in "Parser Options".

   <b>Push</b> <b>Parser</b>
       XML::LibXML provides a push parser interface. Rather than pulling the data from a given source  the  push
       parser waits for the data to be pushed into it.

       This  allows  one  to  parse  large  documents without waiting for the parser to finish. The interface is
       especially useful if a program needs to pre-process the incoming pieces of XML (e.g. to  detect  document
       boundaries).

       While  XML::LibXML  parse_*() functions force the data to be a well-formed XML, the push parser will take
       any arbitrary string that contains some XML data. The only requirement is that all the pushed strings are
       together a well formed document. With the push parser interface  a  program  can  interrupt  the  parsing
       process as required, where the parse_*() functions give not enough flexibility.

       Different  to  the  pull parser implemented in <b>parse_fh()</b> or <b>parse_file()</b>, the push parser is not able to
       find out about the documents end itself. Thus the calling program needs to indicate explicitly  when  the
       parsing is done.

       In XML::LibXML this is done by a single function:

       parse_chunk
             $parser-&gt;parse_chunk($string, $terminate);

           <b>parse_chunk()</b>  tries  to parse a given chunk of data, which isn't necessarily well balanced data. The
           function takes two parameters: The chunk of data as a string and optional a termination flag. If  the
           termination  flag  is  set  to  a  true value (e.g. 1), the parsing will be stopped and the resulting
           document will be returned as the following example describes:

             my $parser = XML::LibXML-&gt;new;
             for my $string ( "&lt;", "foo", ' bar="hello world"', "/&gt;") {
                  $parser-&gt;parse_chunk( $string );
             }
             my $doc = $parser-&gt;parse_chunk("", 1); # terminate the parsing

       Internally XML::LibXML provides three functions that control the push parser process:

       init_push
             $parser-&gt;init_push();

           Initializes the push parser.

       push
             $parser-&gt;push(@data);

           This function pushes the data stored inside the array to libxml2's parser. Each entry in  @data  must
           be a normal scalar! This method can be called repeatedly.

       finish_push
             $doc = $parser-&gt;finish_push( $recover );

           This  function  returns  the  result  of  the  parsing  process. If this function is called without a
           parameter it will complain about non well-formed documents. If $restore is 1, the push parser can  be
           used to restore broken or non well formed (XML) documents as the following example shows:

             eval {
                 $parser-&gt;push( "&lt;foo&gt;", "bar" );
                 $doc = $parser-&gt;finish_push();    # will report broken XML
             };
             if ( $@ ) {
                # ...
             }

           This  can  be  annoying if the closing tag is missed by accident. The following code will restore the
           document:

             eval {
                 $parser-&gt;push( "&lt;foo&gt;", "bar" );
                 $doc = $parser-&gt;<a href="../man1/finish_push.1.html">finish_push</a>(1);   # will return the data parsed
                                                   # unless an error happened
             };

             print $doc-&gt;toString(); # returns "&lt;foo&gt;bar&lt;/foo&gt;"

           Of course <b>finish_push()</b> will return nothing if there was no data pushed to the parser before.

   <b>Pull</b> <b>Parser</b> <b>(Reader)</b>
       XML::LibXML also provides a pull-parser interface similar  to  the  XmlReader  interface  in  .NET.  This
       interface   is   almost   streaming,   and   is   usually  faster  and  simpler  to  use  than  SAX.  See
       XML::LibXML::Reader.

   <b>Direct</b> <b>SAX</b> <b>Parser</b>
       XML::LibXML provides a direct SAX parser in the XML::LibXML::SAX module.

   <b>DOM</b> <b>based</b> <b>SAX</b> <b>Parser</b>
       XML::LibXML  also  provides  a  DOM  based  SAX  parser.  The  SAX  parser  is  defined  in  the   module
       XML::LibXML::SAX::Parser.  As  it  is  not  a  stream  based  parser,  it parses documents into a DOM and
       traverses the DOM tree instead.

       The API of this parser is exactly the same as  any  other  Perl  SAX2  parser.  See  XML::SAX::Intro  for
       details.

       Aside  from  the  regular  parsing  methods,  you  can  access the DOM tree traverser directly, using the
       <b>generate()</b> method:

         my $doc = build_yourself_a_document();
         my $saxparser = $XML::LibXML::SAX::Parser-&gt;new( ... );
         $parser-&gt;generate( $doc );

       This is useful for serializing DOM trees, for example that you might have done prior  processing  on,  or
       that you have as a result of XSLT processing.

       <u>WARNING</u>

       This is NOT a streaming SAX parser. As I said above, this parser reads the entire document into a DOM and
       serialises  it.  Some people couldn't read that in the paragraph above so I've added this warning. If you
       want a streaming SAX parser look at the XML::LibXML::SAX man page

</pre><h4><b>SERIALIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       XML::LibXML provides some functions to serialize nodes and documents.  The  serialization  functions  are
       described on the XML::LibXML::Node manpage or the XML::LibXML::Document manpage. XML::LibXML checks three
       global flags that alter the serialization process:

       •   skipXMLDeclaration

       •   skipDTD

       •   setTagCompression

       of that three functions only setTagCompression is available for all serialization functions.

       Because  XML::LibXML does these flags not itself, one has to define them locally as the following example
       shows:

         local $XML::LibXML::skipXMLDeclaration = 1;
         local $XML::LibXML::skipDTD = 1;
         local $XML::LibXML::setTagCompression = 1;

       If skipXMLDeclaration is defined and not '0', the XML declaration is omitted during serialization.

       If skipDTD is defined and not '0', an existing DTD would not be serialized with the document.

       If setTagCompression is defined and not '0' empty tags are displayed as open and closing tags rather than
       the shortcut. For example the empty tag <u>foo</u> will be rendered as <u>&lt;foo&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;</u> rather than <u>&lt;foo/&gt;</u>.

</pre><h4><b>PARSER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Handling of libxml2 parser options has been unified and improved in XML::LibXML 1.70.  You  can  now  set
       default   options   for   a   particular   parser   instance  by  passing  them  to  the  constructor  as
       "XML::LibXML-&gt;new({name=&gt;value, ...})" or "XML::LibXML-&gt;new(name=&gt;value,...)". The options can be queried
       and changed using the following methods (pre-1.70  interfaces  such  as  "$parser-&gt;<a href="../man0/load_ext_dtd.0.html">load_ext_dtd</a>(0)"  also
       exist, see below):

       option_exists
             $parser-&gt;option_exists($name);

           Returns  1  if  the  current XML::LibXML version supports the option $name, otherwise returns 0 (note
           that this does not necessarily mean that the option is supported by the underlying libxml2 library).

       get_option
             $parser-&gt;get_option($name);

           Returns the current value of the parser option $name.

       set_option
             $parser-&gt;set_option($name,$value);

           Sets option $name to value $value.

       set_options
             $parser-&gt;set_options({$name=&gt;$value,...});

           Sets multiple parsing options at once.

       IMPORTANT NOTE: This documentation reflects the parser flags available in  libxml2  2.7.3.  Some  options
       have no effect if an older version of libxml2 is used.

       Each of the flags listed below is labeled

       /parser/
           if  it  can  be  used  with  a  "XML::LibXML"  parser  object  (i.e.  passed  to  "XML::LibXML-&gt;new",
           "XML::LibXML-&gt;set_option", etc.)

       /html/
           if it can be used passed to the "parse_html_*" methods

       /reader/
           if it can be used with the "XML::LibXML::Reader".

       Unless specified otherwise, the default for boolean valued options is 0 (false).

       The available options are:

       URI /parser, html, reader/

           In case of parsing strings or file handles, XML::LibXML doesn't  know  about  the  base  uri  of  the
           document. To make relative references such as XIncludes work, one has to set a base URI, that is then
           used for the parsed document.

       line_numbers
           /parser, html, reader/

           If  this  option  is activated, libxml2 will store the line number of each element node in the parsed
           document. The line number can be obtained using the line_number() method of  the  "XML::LibXML::Node"
           class  (for  non-element  nodes  this may report the line number of the containing element). The line
           numbers are also used for reporting positions of validation errors.

           IMPORTANT: Due to limitations in the libxml2 library line numbers greater than 65535 will be returned
           as    65535.    Unfortunately,    this    is    a    long    and    sad     story,     please     see
           &lt;<a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi">http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi</a>?id=325533&gt; for more details.

       encoding
           /html/

           character encoding of the input

       recover
           /parser, html, reader/

           recover from errors; possible values are 0, 1, and 2

           A  true  value turns on recovery mode which allows one to parse broken XML or HTML data. The recovery
           mode allows the parser to return the successfully parsed portion  of  the  input  document.  This  is
           useful for almost well-formed documents, where for example a closing tag is missing somewhere. Still,
           XML::LibXML  will  only  parse  until  the  first  fatal  (non-recoverable)  error  occurs, reporting
           recoverable parsing errors as warnings. To suppress even these warnings, use recover=&gt;2.

           Note that validation is switched off automatically in recovery mode.

       expand_entities
           /parser, reader/

           substitute entities; possible values are 0 and 1; default is 1

           Note that although this flag disables entity substitution,  it  does  not  prevent  the  parser  from
           loading  external  entities;  when substitution of an external entity is disabled, the entity will be
           represented in the document tree by an XML_ENTITY_REF_NODE node whose subtree  will  be  the  content
           obtained  by  parsing  the  external  resource;  Although  this nesting is visible from the DOM it is
           transparent to XPath data model, so it is possible to match nodes in an unexpanded entity by the same
           XPath expression as if the entity were expanded.  See also ext_ent_handler.

       ext_ent_handler
           /parser/

           Provide a custom external entity handler to be used when expand_entities is set to 1. Possible  value
           is a subroutine reference.

           This feature does not work properly in libxml2 &lt; 2.6.27!

           The  subroutine  provided  is called whenever the parser needs to retrieve the content of an external
           entity. It is called with two arguments: the system ID (URI) and the public ID. The value returned by
           the subroutine is parsed as the content of the entity.

           This method can be used to completely disable entity loading, e.g. to prevent exploits  of  the  type
           described                                                                                          at
           (&lt;<a href="http://searchsecuritychannel.techtarget.com/generic/0">http://searchsecuritychannel.techtarget.com/generic/0</a>,295582,sid97_gci1304703,00.html&gt;),  where   a
           service  is  tricked  to  expose  its  private data by letting it parse a remote file (RSS feed) that
           contains an entity reference to a local file (e.g. "<a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a>").

           A more granular solution to this problem, however, is provided by custom URL resolvers, as in

             my $c = XML::LibXML::InputCallback-&gt;new();
             sub match {   # accept file:/ URIs except for XML catalogs in <a href="file:/etc/xml/">/etc/xml/</a>
               my ($uri) = @_;
               return ($uri=~m{^file:/}
                       and $uri !~ m{^file://<a href="file:/etc/xml/">/etc/xml/</a>})
                      ? 1 : 0;
             }
             $c-&gt;register_callbacks([ \&amp;match, sub{}, sub{}, sub{} ]);
             $parser-&gt;input_callbacks($c);

       load_ext_dtd
           /parser, reader/

           load the external DTD  subset  while  parsing;  possible  values  are  0  and  1.  Unless  specified,
           XML::LibXML sets this option to 1.

           This flag is also required for DTD Validation, to provide complete attribute, and to expand entities,
           regardless  if  the  document  has  an internal subset. Thus switching off external DTD loading, will
           disable entity expansion, validation, and complete attributes on internal subsets as well.

       complete_attributes
           /parser, reader/

           create default DTD attributes; possible values are 0 and 1

       validation
           /parser, reader/

           validate with the DTD; possible values are 0 and 1

       suppress_errors
           /parser, html, reader/

           suppress error reports; possible values are 0 and 1

       suppress_warnings
           /parser, html, reader/

           suppress warning reports; possible values are 0 and 1

       pedantic_parser
           /parser, html, reader/

           pedantic error reporting; possible values are 0 and 1

       no_blanks
           /parser, html, reader/

           remove blank nodes; possible values are 0 and 1

       no_defdtd
           /html/

           do not add a default DOCTYPE; possible values are 0 and 1

           the default is (0) to add a DTD when the input html lacks one

       expand_xinclude or xinclude
           /parser, reader/

           Implement XInclude substitution; possible values are 0 and 1

           Expands XInclude tags immediately while parsing the document. Note that the parser will use  the  URI
           resolvers installed via "XML::LibXML::InputCallback" to parse the included document (if any).

       no_xinclude_nodes
           /parser, reader/

           do not generate XINCLUDE START/END nodes; possible values are 0 and 1

       no_network
           /parser, html, reader/

           Forbid network access; possible values are 0 and 1

           If  set  to  true,  all attempts to fetch non-local resources (such as DTD or external entities) will
           fail (unless custom callbacks are defined).

           It may be necessary to use the flag "recover" for processing documents requiring such resources while
           networking is off.

       clean_namespaces
           /parser, reader/

           remove redundant namespaces declarations during parsing; possible values are 0 and 1.

       no_cdata
           /parser, html, reader/

           merge CDATA as text nodes; possible values are 0 and 1

       no_basefix
           /parser, reader/

           not fixup XINCLUDE xml#base URIS; possible values are 0 and 1

       huge
           /parser, html, reader/

           relax any hardcoded limit from the parser; possible values are 0 and 1. Unless specified, XML::LibXML
           sets this option to 0.

           Note: the default value for this option was changed to protect  against  denial  of  service  through
           entity  expansion  attacks.  Before enabling the option ensure you have taken alternative measures to
           protect your application against this type of attack.

       gdome
           /parser/

           THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL!

           Although quite powerful, XML::LibXML's DOM implementation is incomplete with respect to the DOM level
           2 or level 3 specifications. XML::GDOME is based on libxml2 as well, and provides a  rather  complete
           DOM  implementation  by  wrapping  libgdome.  This  flag allows you to make use of XML::LibXML's full
           parser options and XML::GDOME's DOM implementation at the same time.

           To make use of this function, one has to install libgdome  and  configure  XML::LibXML  to  use  this
           library. For this you need to rebuild XML::LibXML!

           Note: this feature was not seriously tested in recent XML::LibXML releases.

       For  compatibility  with XML::LibXML versions prior to 1.70, the following methods are also supported for
       querying and setting the corresponding parser options (if called without arguments,  the  methods  return
       the  current  value  of  the  corresponding  parser  options; with an argument sets the option to a given
       value):

         $parser-&gt;validation();
         $parser-&gt;recover();
         $parser-&gt;pedantic_parser();
         $parser-&gt;line_numbers();
         $parser-&gt;load_ext_dtd();
         $parser-&gt;complete_attributes();
         $parser-&gt;expand_xinclude();
         $parser-&gt;gdome_dom();
         $parser-&gt;clean_namespaces();
         $parser-&gt;no_network();

       The following obsolete methods trigger parser options in some special way:

       recover_silently
             $parser-&gt;<a href="../man1/recover_silently.1.html">recover_silently</a>(1);

           If called without an argument, returns true if the current value of the "recover" parser option is  2
           and returns false otherwise. With a true argument sets the "recover" parser option to 2; with a false
           argument sets the "recover" parser option to 0.

       expand_entities
             $parser-&gt;<a href="../man0/expand_entities.0.html">expand_entities</a>(0);

           Get/set  the  "expand_entities" option. If called with a true argument, also turns the "load_ext_dtd"
           option to 1.

       keep_blanks
             $parser-&gt;<a href="../man0/keep_blanks.0.html">keep_blanks</a>(0);

           This is actually the opposite of the "no_blanks" parser option. If used without an argument retrieves
           negated value of "no_blanks". If used with an argument sets "no_blanks" to the opposite value.

       base_uri
             $parser-&gt;base_uri( $your_base_uri );

           Get/set the "URI" option.

</pre><h4><b>XML</b> <b>CATALOGS</b></h4><pre>
       "libxml2" supports XML catalogs. Catalogs are used to map remote resources to their local  copies.  Using
       catalogs  can speed up parsing processes if many external resources from remote addresses are loaded into
       the parsed documents (such as DTDs or XIncludes).

       Note that libxml2 has a global pool of loaded catalogs, so if you apply the method "load_catalog" to  one
       parser  instance,  all  parser  instances  will  start using the catalog (in addition to other previously
       loaded catalogs).

       Note also that catalogs are not used when a custom external entity handler is specified. At  the  current
       state it is not possible to make use of both types of resolving systems at the same time.

       load_catalog
             $parser-&gt;load_catalog( $catalog_file );

           Loads the XML catalog file $catalog_file.

             # Global external entity loader (similar to ext_ent_handler option
             # but this works really globally, also in XML::LibXSLT include etc..)

             XML::LibXML::externalEntityLoader(\&amp;my_loader);

</pre><h4><b>ERROR</b> <b>REPORTING</b></h4><pre>
       XML::LibXML  throws exceptions during parsing, validation or XPath processing (and some other occasions).
       These errors  can  be  caught  by  using  <u>eval</u>  blocks.  The  error  is  stored  in  <u>$@</u>.  There  are  two
       implementations:  the  old  one  throws $@ which is just a message string, in the new one $@ is an object
       from the class XML::LibXML::Error; this class overrides the operator "" so that when printed, the  object
       flattens to the usual error message.

       XML::LibXML  throws  errors  as  they  occur.  This  is  a  very  common  misunderstanding  in the use of
       XML::LibXML. If the eval is omitted, XML::LibXML will always halt your script by "croaking" (see Carp man
       page for details).

       Also note that an increasing number of functions throw errors if bad data is passed as arguments. If  you
       cannot assure valid data passed to XML::LibXML you should eval these functions.

       Note:  since  version  1.59,  <b>get_last_error()</b>  is  no  longer available in XML::LibXML for thread-safety
       reasons.
