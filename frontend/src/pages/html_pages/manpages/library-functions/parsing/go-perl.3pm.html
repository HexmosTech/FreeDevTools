</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       go-perl is part of the go-dev code distribution. It is also available as a separate library in its own
       right.

       go-perl is a collection of perl modules for working with ontologies and data, in particular the Gene
       Ontology and other Open Bio-Ontologies. For background on these projects, see

       <a href="http://www.geneontology.org">http://www.geneontology.org</a>

       <a href="http://obo.sourceforge.net">http://obo.sourceforge.net</a>

       go-perl provides the following functionality:

       parsers
           Biological ontologies and associated data come in assorted formats. See:

           GO::Parser

       handlers/writers
           All  parsers are XML event based - they emit Obo-XML, which can be caught by different handlers. Some
           of these handlers effectively transform the parsed file into a different format or summary.

           If you are not interested in generating XML, you can use an  object  handler,  which  will  give  you
           objects for traversing an ontology; see below

       a graph-based object model
           Biological  ontologies  typically  have graph-based structures (DAGs). go-perl provides a perl object
           model representing ontologies and associations to ontologies. Classes include:

           GO::Model::Term -- a node/term within an ontology

           GO::Model::Graph -- collection of terms and the relationships between them

           GO::Model::Relationship -- a typed relationship between two terms

           GO::Model::Xref -- a database xref, for a term or any other object

           GO::Model::Association -- an association between a term and a gene product

           GO::Model::GeneProduct -- a gene or product of a gene or similar annotated entity

           GO::Model::Evidence -- supporting evidence for an association

           GO::Model::Seq -- a biological sequence of residues for a gene product

   <b>SIMPLE</b> <b>PROGRAMMERS</b> <b>INTERFACE</b>
       GO::Basic

       simple procedural access to GO files

</pre><h4><b>SCRIPTS</b></h4><pre>
       These scripts come as part of the go-perl distribution

       map2slim
           Given a GO slim file, and a current ontology (in one or more files), this  script  will  map  a  gene
           association file (containing annotations to the full GO) to the terms in the GO slim.  The script can
           be  used  to  either  create  a  new  gene  association  file,  containing the most pertinent GO slim
           accessions, or in count-mode, in which case it will give distinct gene product counts for  each  slim
           term.

           for full instructions, see map2slim

       go-dag-summary.pl
           Generates a summary of the DAG structure of an ontology file

           A row will be generated for every ontology in the file, with the following data columns:

             input filename
             total no of terms
             total no of relationships
             total no of paths
             avg no of paths per term (p/t)
             maximum no of paths for any term
             ID of term with maximum no of paths

           for full instructions, see go-dag-summary.pl

       go-show-paths-to-root.pl
           Will show all possible paths from a term to the root/top in the ontology

           for full instructions, see go-show-paths-to-root.pl

       go-apply-xslt
           Will apply a GO XSL transform (by name) on an OBO-XML file

           For a full list of XSLs available, see &lt;<a href="http://www.godatabase.org/xml/xsl">http://www.godatabase.org/xml/xsl</a>&gt;

       go-export-graph.pl
           Writes an obo file out as an ascii-tree, a graphviz PNG or other format

           for full instructions, see go-export-graph.pl

       go-show-assocs-by-node.pl
           given  a GO ontology file and an association file and a term ID, will list all products associated to
           that ID

           for full instructions, see go-show-assocs-by-node.pl

       go-filter-subset.pl
           Exports a subset of an ontology from a file. The subset can be based on a specified  set  of  IDs,  a
           preset "subset" filter in the ontology file (eg a GO "slim" or subset), or a user-defined filter.

           The subset can be exported in any format, including a graphical image

           for full instructions, see go-filter-subset.pl

       go2fmt.pl
           generic  file  converter.  This  will  convert  any  go/obo formatted file such as ontology files and
           association files and write output in some other format or report. See the full list  of  convenience
           scripts below.

           for full instructions, see go2fmt.pl

       go2godb_prestore

           schema, and can be loaded with DBIx::DBStag. See also go2fmt.pl

       go2error_report
           converts a file in any valid go/obo format to error_report. See also go2fmt.pl
