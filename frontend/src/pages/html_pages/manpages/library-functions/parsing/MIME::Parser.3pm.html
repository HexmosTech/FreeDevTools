</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MIME::Parser - experimental class for parsing MIME streams

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Before reading further, you should see MIME::Tools to make sure that you understand where this module
       fits into the grand scheme of things.  Go on, do it now.  I'll wait.

       Ready?  Ok...

   <b>Basic</b> <b>usage</b> <b>examples</b>
           ### Create a new parser object:
           my $parser = new MIME::Parser;

           ### Tell it where to put things:
           $parser-&gt;output_under("<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>");

           ### Parse an input filehandle:
           $entity = $parser-&gt;parse(\*STDIN);

           ### Congratulations: you now have a (possibly multipart) MIME entity!
           $entity-&gt;dump_skeleton;          # for debugging

   <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>input</b>
           ### Parse from filehandles:
           $entity = $parser-&gt;parse(\*STDIN);
           $entity = $parser-&gt;parse(IO::File-&gt;new("some command|");

           ### Parse from any object that supports getline() and read():
           $entity = $parser-&gt;parse($myHandle);

           ### Parse an in-core MIME message:
           $entity = $parser-&gt;parse_data($message);

           ### Parse an MIME message in a file:
           $entity = $parser-&gt;parse_open("/some/file.msg");

           ### Parse an MIME message out of a pipeline:
           $entity = $parser-&gt;parse_open("gunzip - &lt; file.msg.gz |");

           ### Parse already-split input (as "deliver" would give it to you):
           $entity = $parser-&gt;parse_two("msg.head", "msg.body");

   <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>output</b> <b>control</b>
           ### Keep parsed message bodies in core (default outputs to disk):
           $parser-&gt;<a href="../man1/output_to_core.1.html">output_to_core</a>(1);

           ### Output each message body to a one-per-message directory:
           $parser-&gt;output_under("<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>");

           ### Output each message body to the same directory:
           $parser-&gt;output_dir("<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>");

           ### Change how nameless message-component files are named:
           $parser-&gt;output_prefix("msg");

           ### Put temporary files somewhere else
           $parser-&gt;tmp_dir("/var/tmp/mytmpdir");

   <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> <b>recovery</b>
           ### Normal mechanism:
           eval { $entity = $parser-&gt;parse(\*STDIN) };
           if ($@) {
               $results  = $parser-&gt;results;
               $decapitated = $parser-&gt;last_head;  ### get last top-level head
           }

           ### Ultra-tolerant mechanism:
           $parser-&gt;<a href="../man1/ignore_errors.1.html">ignore_errors</a>(1);
           $entity = eval { $parser-&gt;parse(\*STDIN) };
           $error = ($@ || $parser-&gt;last_error);

           ### Cleanup all files created by the parse:
           eval { $entity = $parser-&gt;parse(\*STDIN) };
           ...
           $parser-&gt;filer-&gt;purge;

   <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>parser</b> <b>options</b>
           ### Automatically attempt to RFC 2047-decode the MIME headers?
           $parser-&gt;<a href="../man1/decode_headers.1.html">decode_headers</a>(1);             ### default is false

           ### Parse contained "message/rfc822" objects as nested MIME streams?
           $parser-&gt;<a href="../man0/extract_nested_messages.0.html">extract_nested_messages</a>(0);    ### default is true

           ### Look for uuencode in "text" messages, and extract it?
           $parser-&gt;<a href="../man1/extract_uuencode.1.html">extract_uuencode</a>(1);           ### default is false

           ### Should we forgive normally-fatal errors?
           $parser-&gt;<a href="../man0/ignore_errors.0.html">ignore_errors</a>(0);              ### default is true

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>examples</b>
           ### Convert a Mail::Internet object to a MIME::Entity:
           my $data = join('', (@{$mail-&gt;header}, "\n", @{$mail-&gt;body}));
           $entity = $parser-&gt;parse_data(\$data);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You can inherit from this class to create your own subclasses that parse MIME streams into MIME::Entity
       objects.

</pre><h4><b>PUBLIC</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Construction</b>
       new ARGS...
           <u>Class</u>  <u>method.</u>  Create a new parser object.  Once you do this, you can then set up various parameters
           before doing the actual parsing.  For example:

               my $parser = new MIME::Parser;
               $parser-&gt;output_dir("<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>");
               $parser-&gt;output_prefix("msg1");
               my $entity = $parser-&gt;parse(\*STDIN);

           Any arguments are passed into init().  Don't  override  this  in  your  subclasses;  override  <b>init()</b>
           instead.

       init ARGS...
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Initiallize a new MIME::Parser object.  This is automatically sent to a new object;
           you may want to override it.  If you override this, be sure to invoke the inherited method.

       init_parse
           <u>Instance</u>  <u>method.</u>   Invoked automatically whenever one of the top-level <b>parse()</b> methods is called, to
           reset the parser to a "ready" state.

   <b>Altering</b> <b>how</b> <b>messages</b> <b>are</b> <b>parsed</b>
       decode_headers [YESNO]
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Controls whether the parser will attempt to decode all the MIME headers (as per RFC
           2047) the moment it sees them.  <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>advisable</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>reasons:</b>

           •   <b>It</b> <b>screws</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>from</b> <b>MIME</b> <b>fields.</b>  If you  fully  decode  the  headers
               into bytes, you can inadvertently transform a parseable MIME header like this:

                   Content-type: text/plain; filename="=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Hi=22Ho?="

               into unparseable gobbledygook; in this case:

                   Content-type: text/plain; filename="Hi"Ho"

           •   <b>It</b>  <b>is</b>  <b>information-lossy.</b>  An encoded string which contains both Latin-1 and Cyrillic characters
               will be turned into a binary mishmosh which simply can't be rendered.

           <b>History.</b>  This method was once the only out-of-the-box way to deal with attachments  whose  filenames
           had non-ASCII characters.  However, since MIME-tools 5.4xx this is no longer necessary.

           <b>Parameters.</b>   If YESNO is true, decoding is done.  However, you will get a warning unless you use one
           of the special "true" values:

              "I_NEED_TO_FIX_THIS"
                     Just shut up and do it.  Not recommended.
                     Provided only for those who need to keep old scripts functioning.

              "I_KNOW_WHAT_I_AM_DOING"
                     Just shut up and do it.  Not recommended.
                     Provided for those who REALLY know what they are doing.

           If YESNO is false (the default), no attempt at decoding will be done.  With no argument, just returns
           the current setting.  <b>Remember:</b> you can always decode the headers <u>after</u>  the  parsing  has  completed
           (see <b>MIME::Head::decode()</b>), or decode the words on demand (see MIME::Words).

       extract_nested_messages OPTION
           <u>Instance</u>  <u>method.</u>  Some MIME messages will contain a part of type "message/rfc822" ,"message/partial"
           or "message/external-body": literally, the text of  an  embedded  mail/news/whatever  message.   This
           option controls whether (and how) we parse that embedded message.

           If  the  OPTION is false, we treat such a message just as if it were a "text/plain" document, without
           attempting to decode its contents.

           If the OPTION is true (the default), the body of the "message/rfc822" or  "message/partial"  part  is
           parsed  by  this  parser,  creating  an entity object.  What happens then is determined by the actual
           OPTION:

           NEST or 1
               The default setting.  The contained message becomes  the  sole  "part"  of  the  "message/rfc822"
               entity  (as  if  the  containing  message  were  a special kind of "multipart" message).  You can
               recover the sub-entity by invoking the <b>parts()</b> method on the "message/rfc822" entity.

           REPLACE
               The contained message replaces  the  "message/rfc822"  entity,  as  though  the  "message/rfc822"
               "container" never existed.

               <b>Warning:</b> notice that, with this option, all the header information in the "message/rfc822" header
               is  lost.  This might seriously bother you if you're dealing with a top-level message, and you've
               just lost the sender's address and the subject line.  ":-/".

           <u>Thanks</u> <u>to</u> <u>Andreas</u> <u>Koenig</u> <u>for</u> <u>suggesting</u> <u>this</u> <u>method.</u>

       extract_uuencode [YESNO]
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  If set true, then whenever  we  are  confronted  with  a  message  whose  effective
           content-type  is "text/plain" and whose encoding is 7bit/8bit/binary, we scan the encoded body to see
           if it contains uuencoded data (generally given away by a "begin XXX" line).

           If it does, we explode the uuencoded message into a multipart, where the text before the first "begin
           XXX" becomes the first part, and all "begin...end" sections following become  the  subsequent  parts.
           The filename (if given) is accessible through the normal means.

       ignore_errors [YESNO]
           <u>Instance</u>  <u>method.</u>  Controls whether the parser will attempt to ignore normally-fatal errors, treating
           them as warnings and continuing with the parse.

           If YESNO is true (the default), many syntax errors are tolerated.  If YESNO is  false,  fatal  errors
           throw exceptions.  With no argument, just returns the current setting.

       decode_bodies [YESNO]
           <u>Instance</u>  <u>method.</u>  Controls whether the parser should decode entity bodies or not.  If this is set to
           a false value (default is true), all entity bodies will  be  kept  as-is  in  the  original  content-
           transfer encoding.

           To  prevent  double encoding on the output side MIME::Body-&gt;is_encoded is set, which tells MIME::Body
           not to encode the data again, if encoded data was requested. This is in particular useful, when  it's
           important  that  the  content  <b>must</b> <b>not</b> be modified, e.g. if you want to calculate OpenPGP signatures
           from it.

           <b>WARNING</b>: the semantics change significantly if you parse MIME messages with this option set,  because
           MIME::Entity  resp.  MIME::Body *always* see encoded data now, while the default behaviour is working
           with *decoded* data (and encoding it only if you request it).  You need to decode the data  yourself,
           if you want to have it decoded.

           So use this option only if you exactly know, what you're doing, and that you're sure, that you really
           need it.

   <b>Parsing</b> <b>an</b> <b>input</b> <b>source</b>
       parse_data DATA
           <u>Instance</u>  <u>method.</u>   Parse  a  MIME  message  that's  already in core.  This internally creates an "in
           memory" filehandle on a Perl scalar value using PerlIO

           You may supply the DATA in any of a number of ways...

           •   <b>A</b> <b>scalar</b> which holds the message.  A reference to this scalar will be used internally.

           •   <b>A</b> <b>ref</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>scalar</b> which holds the message.  This reference will be used internally.

           •   <b>DEPRECATED</b>

               <b>A</b> <b>ref</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>array</b> <b>of</b> <b>scalars.</b>  The array is internally concatenated into a temporary string,  and
               a reference to the new string is used internally.

               It is much more efficient to pass in a scalar reference, so please consider refactoring your code
               to use that interface instead.  If you absolutely MUST pass an array, you may be better off using
               IO::ScalarArray  in  the  calling  code  to generate a filehandle, and passing that filehandle to
               <u><b>parse()</b></u>

           Returns the parsed MIME::Entity on success.

       parse INSTREAM
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Takes a MIME-stream and splits it into its component entities.

           The INSTREAM can be given as an IO::File, a globref filehandle (like "\*STDIN"), or  as  <u>any</u>  blessed
           object conforming to the IO:: interface (which minimally implements <b>getline()</b> and <b>read()</b>).

           Returns  the  parsed MIME::Entity on success.  Throws exception on failure.  If the message contained
           too many parts (as set by <u>max_parts</u>), returns undef.

       parse_open EXPR
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Convenience front-end onto parse().  Simply give this method  any  expression  that
           may be sent as the second argument to <b>open()</b> to open a filehandle for reading.

           Returns the parsed MIME::Entity on success.  Throws exception on failure.

       parse_two HEADFILE, BODYFILE
           <u>Instance</u>  <u>method.</u>  Convenience front-end onto parse_open(), intended for programs running under mail-
           handlers like <b>deliver</b>, which splits the incoming mail message into a header file  and  a  body  file.
           Simply give this method the paths to the respective files.

           <b>Warning:</b>  it  is  assumed  that,  once  the  files  are  cat'ed  together, there will be a blank line
           separating the head part and the body part.

           <b>Warning:</b> new implementation slurps files into line array for portability,  instead  of  using  'cat'.
           May be an issue if your messages are large.

           Returns the parsed MIME::Entity on success.  Throws exception on failure.

   <b>Specifying</b> <b>output</b> <b>destination</b>
       <b>Warning:</b>  in  5.212 and before, this was done by methods of MIME::Parser.  However, since many users have
       requested fine-tuned control over how this is done, the logic has been split off from the parser into its
       own class, MIME::Parser::Filer Every MIME::Parser maintains an instance of a MIME::Parser::Filer subclass
       to manage disk output (see MIME::Parser::Filer for details.)

       The benefit to this is that the MIME::Parser code won't be confounded with a lot of  garbage  related  to
       disk output.  The drawback is that the way you override the default behavior will change.

       For now, all the normal public-interface methods are still provided, but many are only stubs which create
       or delegate to the underlying MIME::Parser::Filer object.

       filer [FILER]
           <u>Instance</u>  <u>method.</u>  Get/set the FILER object used to manage the output of files to disk.  This will be
           some subclass of MIME::Parser::Filer.

       output_dir DIRECTORY
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Causes messages to be filed directly into the given DIRECTORY.   It  does  this  by
           setting the underlying <b>filer()</b> to a new instance of MIME::Parser::FileInto, and passing the arguments
           into that class' <b>new()</b> method.

           <b>Note:</b>  Since  this method replaces the underlying filer, you must invoke it <u>before</u> doing changing any
           attributes of the filer, like the output prefix; otherwise those changes will be lost.

       output_under BASEDIR, OPTS...
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Causes messages to be filed directly into subdirectories of the given BASEDIR,  one
           subdirectory  per  message.   It  does  this  by  setting the underlying <b>filer()</b> to a new instance of
           MIME::Parser::FileUnder, and passing the arguments into that class' <b>new()</b> method.

           <b>Note:</b> Since this method replaces the underlying filer, you must invoke it <u>before</u> doing  changing  any
           attributes of the filer, like the output prefix; otherwise those changes will be lost.

       output_path HEAD
           <u>Instance</u>  <u>method,</u>  <u>DEPRECATED.</u>   Given  a  MIME  head for a file to be extracted, come up with a good
           output pathname for the extracted file.  Identical to the preferred form:

                $parser-&gt;filer-&gt;output_path(...args...);

           We just delegate this to the underlying <b>filer()</b> object.

       output_prefix [PREFIX]
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method,</u> <u>DEPRECATED.</u>  Get/set the short string that all filenames  for  extracted  body-parts
           will  begin  with  (assuming  that  there  is  no  better  "recommended filename").  Identical to the
           preferred form:

                $parser-&gt;filer-&gt;output_prefix(...args...);

           We just delegate this to the underlying <b>filer()</b> object.

       evil_filename NAME
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method,</u> <u>DEPRECATED.</u>  Identical to the preferred form:

                $parser-&gt;filer-&gt;evil_filename(...args...);

           We just delegate this to the underlying <b>filer()</b> object.

       max_parts NUM
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Limits the number of MIME parts we will parse.

           Normally, instances of this class parse a message to the bitter end.  Messages with many  MIME  parts
           can  cause  excessive memory consumption.  If you invoke this method, parsing will abort with a <b>die()</b>
           if a message contains more than NUM parts.

           If NUM is set to -1 (the default), then no maximum limit is enforced.

           With no argument, returns the current setting as an integer

       output_to_core YESNO
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Normally, instances of this class output all their decoded body data to disk  files
           (via  MIME::Body::File).   However,  you  can  change  this  behaviour by invoking this method before
           parsing:

           If YESNO is false (the default), then all body data goes to disk files.

           If YESNO is true, then all body data goes to in-core data structures This is a little risky (what  if
           someone  emails  you  an  MPEG or a tar file, hmmm?) but people seem to want this bit of noose-shaped
           rope, so I'm providing it.  Note that setting this attribute true <u>does</u> <u>not</u> mean that  parser-internal
           temporary files are avoided!  Use <b>tmp_to_core()</b> for that.

           With no argument, returns the current setting as a boolean.

       tmp_recycling
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method,</u> <u>DEPRECATED.</u>

           This method is a no-op to preserve the pre-5.421 API.

           The <b>tmp_recycling()</b> feature was removed in 5.421 because it had never actually worked.  Please update
           your code to stop using it.

       tmp_to_core [YESNO]
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Should <b>new_tmpfile()</b> create real temp files, or use fake in-core ones?  Normally we
           allow the creation of temporary disk files, since this allows us to handle huge attachments even when
           core is limited.

           If  YESNO  is true, we implement <b>new_tmpfile()</b> via in-core handles.  If YESNO is false (the default),
           we use real tmpfiles.  With no argument, just returns the current setting.

       use_inner_files [YESNO]
           <u>REMOVED</u>.

           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>

           MIME::Parser  no  longer  supports  IO::InnerFile,  but  this  method  is  retained   for   backwards
           compatibility.  It does nothing.

           The  original reasoning for IO::InnerFile was that inner files were faster than "in-core" temp files.
           At the time, the "in-core" tempfile support was  implemented  with  IO::Scalar  from  the  IO-Stringy
           distribution,  which  used  the  <b>tie()</b>  interface  to  wrap  a scalar with the appropriate IO::Handle
           operations.  The penalty for this was fairly hefty, and IO::InnerFile actually was faster.

           Nowadays, MIME::Parser uses Perl's built in ability to open  a  filehandle  on  an  in-memory  scalar
           variable  via  PerlIO.  Benchmarking shows that IO::InnerFile is slightly slower than using in-memory
           temporary files, and is slightly faster than on-disk temporary files.  Both measurements are within a
           few percent of each other.  Since there's no real benefit, and  since  the  IO::InnerFile  abuse  was
           fairly  hairy  and  evil  ("writes" to it were faked by extending the size of the inner file with the
           assumption that the only data you'd ever -&gt;<b>print()</b> to it would be the line from the "outer" file, for
           example) it's been removed.

   <b>Specifying</b> <b>classes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>instantiated</b>
       interface ROLE,[VALUE]
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  During parsing, the parser normally creates  instances  of  certain  classes,  like
           MIME::Entity.   However,  you  may  want  to create a parser subclass that uses your own experimental
           head, entity, etc. classes (for example, your "head" class may provide  some  additional  MIME-field-
           oriented methods).

           If so, then this is the method that your subclass should invoke during init.  Use it like this:

               package MyParser;
               @ISA = qw(MIME::Parser);
               ...
               sub init {
                   my $self = shift;
                   $self-&gt;SUPER::init(@_);        ### do my parent's init
                   $self-&gt;interface(ENTITY_CLASS =&gt; 'MIME::MyEntity');
                   $self-&gt;interface(HEAD_CLASS   =&gt; 'MIME::MyHead');
                   $self;                         ### return
               }

           With no VALUE, returns the VALUE currently associated with that ROLE.

       new_body_for HEAD
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Based on the HEAD of a part we are parsing, return a new body object (any desirable
           subclass of MIME::Body) for receiving that part's data.

           If  you  set  the  "output_to_core"  option  to  false  before  parsing  (the  default), then we call
           output_path() and create a new MIME::Body::File on that filename.

           If you set the "output_to_core" option to true before parsing,  then  you  get  a  MIME::Body::InCore
           instead.

           If you want the parser to do something else entirely, you can override this method in a subclass.

   <b>Temporary</b> <b>File</b> <b>Creation</b>
       tmp_dir DIRECTORY
           <u>Instance</u>  <u>method.</u>   Causes  any  temporary  files  created  by this parser to be created in the given
           DIRECTORY.

           If called without arguments, returns current value.

           The default value is undef, which will cause  <b>new_tmpfile()</b>  to  use  the  system  default  temporary
           directory.

       new_tmpfile
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Return an IO handle to be used to hold temporary data during a parse.

           The default uses <b>MIME::Tools::tmpopen()</b> to create a new temporary file, unless <b>tmp_to_core()</b> dictates
           otherwise, but you can override this.  You shouldn't need to.

           The location for temporary files can be changed on a per-parser basis with <b>tmp_dir()</b>.

           If you do override this, make certain that the object you return is set for <b>binmode()</b>, and is able to
           handle the following methods:

               read(BUF, NBYTES)
               getline()
               getlines()
               print(@ARGS)
               flush()
               seek(0, 0)

           Fatal exception if the stream could not be established.

   <b>Parse</b> <b>results</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> <b>recovery</b>
       last_error
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Return the error (if any) that we ignored in the last parse.

       ambiguous_content
           <u>Instance</u>  <u>method.</u>   Returns  true  if  the most recently parsed message has one or more entities with
           ambiguous content.  See the documentation of "MIME::Entity"'s "ambiguous_content" method for details.

           Note that while these two calls to ambuguous_content return the same thing:

               $entity = $parser-&gt;parse($whatever_stream);
               $parser-&gt;ambuguous_content();
               $entity-&gt;ambuguous_content();

           the former is faster because it simply returns the results that were detected during the parse, while
           the latter actually executes the code that checks for ambiguous content again.

           Messages with ambiguous content should be treated as a security risk.  In particular, if MIME::Parser
           is used in an email security tool, ambiguous messages should not be delivered to end-users.

       last_head
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Return the top-level MIME header of the last stream we attempted to parse.  This is
           useful for replying to people who sent us bad MIME messages.

               ### Parse an input stream:
               eval { $entity = $parser-&gt;parse(\*STDIN) };
               if (!$entity) {    ### parse failed!
                   my $decapitated = $parser-&gt;last_head;
                   ...
               }

       results
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Return an object containing lots of info from the last entity parsed.  This will be
           an instance of class MIME::Parser::Results.

   <b>Maximizing</b> <b>speed</b>
       Optimum input mechanisms:

           parse()                    YES (if you give it a globref or a
                                           subclass of IO::File)
           parse_open()               YES
           parse_data()               NO  (see below)
           parse_two()                NO  (see below)

       Optimum settings:

           decode_headers()           *** (no real difference; 0 is slightly faster)
           extract_nested_messages()  0   (may be slightly faster, but in
                                           general you want it set to 1)
           output_to_core()           0   (will be MUCH faster)
           tmp_to_core()              0   (will be MUCH faster)

       <b>Native</b> <b>I/O</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>object-oriented</b> <b>I/O.</b>  It's much faster to use &lt;$foo&gt;  than  $foo-&gt;getline.
       For  backwards compatibility, this module must continue to use object-oriented I/O in most places, but if
       you use <b>parse()</b> with a "real" filehandle (string, globref, or subclass of IO::File) then MIME::Parser  is
       able to perform some crucial optimizations.

       <b>The</b> <b>parse_two()</b> <b>call</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>inefficient.</b>  Currently this is just a front-end onto <b>parse_data()</b>.  If your
       OS supports it, you're <u>far</u> better off doing something like:

           $parser-&gt;parse_open("<a href="file:/bin/cat">/bin/cat</a> msg.head msg.body |");

   <b>Minimizing</b> <b>memory</b>
       Optimum input mechanisms:

           parse_data()               NO  (in-core I/O will burn core)
           parse_two()                NO  (in-core I/O will burn core)

       Optimum settings:

           decode_headers()           *** (no real difference)
           extract_nested_messages()  *** (no real difference)
           output_to_core()           0   (will use MUCH less memory)
                                           tmp_to_core is 1)
           tmp_to_core()              0   (will use MUCH less memory)

           decode_headers()           0   (sidesteps problem of bad hdr encodings)
           extract_nested_messages()  0   (sidesteps problems of bad nested messages,
                                           but often you want it set to 1 anyway).

   <b>Avoiding</b> <b>disk-based</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>files</b>
       Optimum input mechanisms:

           parse()                    YES (if you give it a seekable handle)
           parse_open()               YES (becomes a seekable handle)
           parse_data()               NO  (unless you set <a href="../man1/tmp_to_core.1.html">tmp_to_core</a>(1))
           parse_two()                NO  (unless you set <a href="../man1/tmp_to_core.1.html">tmp_to_core</a>(1))

           decode_headers()           *** (doesn't matter)
           extract_nested_messages()  *** (doesn't matter)

           tmp_to_core()              1

       <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>veto</b> <b>tmpfiles</b> <b>entirely.</b>  You can set <b>tmp_to_core()</b> true: this will always use in-core I/O for the
       buffering (<b>warning:</b> this will slow down the parsing of messages with large attachments).

       <b>Final</b> <b>resort.</b>  You can always override <b>new_tmpfile()</b> in a subclass.

</pre><h4><b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Multipart messages are always read line-by-line
           Multipart  document  parts  are read line-by-line, so that the encapsulation boundaries may easily be
           detected.  However, bad MIME composition  agents  (for  example,  naive  CGI  scripts)  might  return
           multipart documents where the parts are, say, unencoded bitmap files... and, consequently, where such
           "lines" might be veeeeeeeeery long indeed.

           A  better  solution for this case would be to set up some form of state machine for input processing.
           This will be left for future versions.

       Multipart parts read into temp files before decoding
           In my original implementation, the MIME::Decoder classes had to be aware of encapsulation  boundaries
           in  multipart  MIME  documents.   While  this  decode-while-parsing  approach  obviated  the need for
           temporary files, it resulted in inflexible and complex decoder implementations.

           The revised implementation uses a temporary file (a la tmpfile()) during parsing to hold the  <u>encoded</u>
           portion  of  the current MIME document or part.  This file is deleted automatically after the current
           part is decoded and the data is written to the "body stream" object; you'll never see it, and  should
           never need to worry about it.

           Some  folks  have  asked  for  the ability to bypass this temp-file mechanism, I suppose because they
           assume it would slow down their application.  I considered accommodating this wish, but the temp-file
           approach solves a lot of thorny problems in parsing, and it also protects against hidden bugs in user
           applications (what if you've directed the encoded part into a scalar, and someone unexpectedly  sends
           you  a  6  MB  tar  file?).   Finally, I'm just not convinced that the temp-file use adds significant
           overhead.

       Fuzzing of CRLF and newline on input
           RFC 2045 dictates that MIME streams have lines terminated by CRLF ("\r\n").  However, it is extremely
           likely that folks will want to parse MIME streams where each line ends in the local newline character
           "\n" instead.

           An attempt has been made to allow the parser to handle both CRLF and newline-terminated input.

       Fuzzing of CRLF and newline on output
           The "7bit" and "8bit" decoders will decode both a "\n" and a "\r\n" end-of-line sequence into a "\n".

           The "binary" decoder (default if no encoding specified) still outputs stuff  verbatim...  so  a  MIME
           message with CRLFs and no explicit encoding will be output as a text file that, on many systems, will
           have an annoying ^M at the end of each line... <u>but</u> <u>this</u> <u>is</u> <u>as</u> <u>it</u> <u>should</u> <u>be</u>.

       Inability to handle multipart boundaries that contain newlines
           First,  let's  get  something  straight: <u>this</u> <u>is</u> <u>an</u> <u>evil,</u> <u>EVIL</u> <u>practice,</u> and is incompatible with RFC
           2046... hence, it's not valid MIME.

           If your mailer creates multipart boundary strings that contain  newlines  <u>when</u>  <u>they</u>  <u>appear</u>  <u>in</u>  <u>the</u>
           <u>message</u>  <u>body,</u>  give it two weeks notice and find another one.  If your mail robot receives MIME mail
           like this, regard it as syntactically incorrect MIME, which it is.

           Why do I say that?  Well, in RFC 2046, the syntax of a boundary is given quite clearly:

                 boundary := 0*69&lt;bchars&gt; bcharsnospace

                 bchars := bcharsnospace / " "

                 bcharsnospace :=    DIGIT / ALPHA / "'" / "(" / ")" / "+" /"_"
                              / "," / "-" / "." / "/" / ":" / "=" / "?"

           All of which means that a valid boundary string <u>cannot</u> have newlines in it, and any newlines in  such
           a  string  in  the  message  header are expected to be solely the result of <u>folding</u> the string (i.e.,
           inserting to-be-removed newlines for readability and line-shortening <u>only</u>).

           Yet, there is at least one brain-damaged user agent out there that composes mail like this:

                 MIME-Version: 1.0
                 Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary="----ABC-
                  123----"
                 Subject: Hi... I'm a dork!

                 This is a multipart MIME message (yeah, right...)

                 ----ABC-

                  123----
                 Hi there!

           We have <u>got</u> to discourage practices like this (and the recent file upload idiocy where  binary  files
           that  are  part of a multipart MIME message aren't base64-encoded) if we want MIME to stay relatively
           simple, and MIME parsers to be relatively robust.

           <u>Thanks</u> <u>to</u> <u>Andreas</u> <u>Koenig</u> <u>for</u> <u>bringing</u> <u>a</u> <u>baaaaaaaaad</u> <u>user</u> <u>agent</u> <u>to</u> <u>my</u> <u>attention.</u>
