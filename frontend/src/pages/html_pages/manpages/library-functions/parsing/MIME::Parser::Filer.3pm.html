</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MIME::Parser::Filer - manage file-output of the parser

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Before reading further, you should see MIME::Parser to make sure that you understand where this module
       fits into the grand scheme of things.  Go on, do it now.  I'll wait.

       Ready?  Ok... now read "DESCRIPTION" below, and everything else should make sense.

   <b>Public</b> <b>interface</b>
           ### Create a "filer" of the desired class:
           my $filer = MIME::Parser::FileInto-&gt;new($dir);
           my $filer = MIME::Parser::FileUnder-&gt;new($basedir);
           ...

           ### Want added security?  Don't let outsiders name your files:
           $filer-&gt;<a href="../man1/ignore_filename.1.html">ignore_filename</a>(1);

           ### Prepare for the parsing of a new top-level message:
           $filer-&gt;init_parse;

           ### Return the path where this message's data should be placed:
           $path = $filer-&gt;output_path($head);

   <b>Semi-public</b> <b>interface</b>
       These methods might be overridden or ignored in some subclasses, so they don't all make sense in all
       circumstances:

           ### Tweak the mapping from content-type to extension:
           $emap = $filer-&gt;output_extension_map;
           $emap-&gt;{"text/html"} = ".htm";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>How</b> <b>this</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>when</b> <b>parsing</b>
       When a MIME::Parser decides that it wants to output a file to disk, it uses its "Filer" object -- an
       instance of a MIME::Parser::Filer subclass -- to determine where to put the file.

       Every parser has a single Filer object, which it uses for all parsing.  You can get the Filer for a given
       $parser like this:

           $filer = $parser-&gt;filer;

       At the beginning of each parse(), the filer's internal state is reset by the parser:

           $parser-&gt;filer-&gt;init_parse;

       The parser can then get a path for each entity in the message by handing that entity's header (a
       MIME::Head) to the filer and having it do the work, like this:

           $new_file = $parser-&gt;filer-&gt;output_path($head);

       Since it's nice to be able to clean up after a parse (especially a failed parse), the parser tells the
       filer when it has actually used a path:

           $parser-&gt;filer-&gt;purgeable($new_file);

       Then, if you want to clean up the files which were created for a particular parse (and also any
       directories that the Filer created), you would do this:

           $parser-&gt;filer-&gt;purge;

   <b>Writing</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>subclasses</b>
       There are two standard "Filer" subclasses (see below): <b>MIME::Parser::FileInto</b>, which throws all files
       from all parses into the same directory, and <b>MIME::Parser::FileUnder</b> (preferred), which creates a
       subdirectory for each message.  Hopefully, these will be sufficient for most uses, but just in case...

       The only method you have to override is <b>output_path()</b>:

           $filer-&gt;output_path($head);

       This method is invoked by MIME::Parser when it wants to put a decoded message body in an output file.
       The method should return a path to the file to create.  Failure is indicated by throwing an exception.

       The path returned by output_path() should be "ready for <b>open()</b>": any necessary parent directories need to
       exist at that point.  These directories can be created by the Filer, if course, and they should be marked
       as <b>purgeable()</b> if a purge should delete them.

       Actually, if your issue is more <u>where</u> the files go than what they're named, you can use the default
       <b>output_path()</b> method and just override one of its components:

           $dir  = $filer-&gt;output_dir($head);
           $name = $filer-&gt;output_filename($head);
           ...

</pre><h4><b>PUBLIC</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>MIME::Parser::Filer</b>
       This is the abstract superclass of all "filer" objects.

       new INITARGS...
           <u>Class</u>  <u>method,</u>  <u>constructor.</u>   Create a new outputter for the given parser.  Any subsequent arguments
           are given to <b>init()</b>, which subclasses should override for  their  own  use  (the  default  init  does
           nothing).

       results RESULTS
           <u>Instance</u>  <u>method.</u>   Link  this filer to a MIME::Parser::Results object which will tally the messages.
           Notice that we avoid linking it to the parser to avoid circular reference!

       init_parse
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Prepare to start parsing a new message.  Subclasses should always be sure to invoke
           the inherited method.

       evil_filename FILENAME
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Is this an evil filename; i.e., one which should not be used in generating  a  disk
           file name?  It is if any of these are true:

               * it is empty or entirely whitespace
               * it contains leading or trailing whitespace
               * it is a string of dots: ".", "..", etc.
               * it contains characters not in the set: "A" - "Z", "a" - "z",
                 "0" - "9", "-", "_", "+", "=", ".", ",", "@", "#",
                 "$", and " ".
               * it is too long

           If  you  just  want  to  change  this  behavior,  you  should override this method in the subclass of
           MIME::Parser::Filer that you use.

           <b>Warning:</b> at the time this method is invoked, the FILENAME has already been unmime'd  into  the  local
           character  set.   If  you're  using  any  character  set  other than ASCII, ISO-8859-*, or UTF-8, the
           interpretation of the "path" characters might be very  different,  and  you  will  probably  need  to
           override this method.  See "unmime" in MIME::WordDecoder for more details.

           <b>Note:</b>  subclasses  of MIME::Parser::Filer which override <b>output_path()</b> might not consult this method;
           note, however, that the built-in subclasses do consult it.

           <u>Thanks</u> <u>to</u> <u>Andrew</u> <u>Pimlott</u> <u>for</u> <u>finding</u> <u>a</u> <u>real</u> <u>dumb</u> <u>bug</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>original</u>  <u>version.</u>   <u>Thanks</u>  <u>to</u>  <u>Nickolay</u>
           <u>Saukh</u> <u>for</u> <u>noting</u> <u>that</u> <u>evil</u> <u>is</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>eye</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>beholder.</u>

       exorcise_filename FILENAME
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  If a given filename is evil (see "evil_filename") we try to rescue it by performing
           some  basic  operations:  shortening  it,  removing  bad  characters, etc., and checking each against
           <b>evil_filename()</b>.

           Returns the exorcised filename (which is guaranteed to not be evil), or undef  if  it  could  not  be
           salvaged.

           <b>Warning:</b>  at  the  time this method is invoked, the FILENAME has already been unmime'd into the local
           character set.  If you're using anything character set other than ASCII, ISO-8859-*,  or  UTF-8,  the
           interpretation  of  the "path" characters might be very very different, and you will probably need to
           override this method.  See "unmime" in MIME::WordDecoder for more details.

       find_unused_path DIR, FILENAME
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method,</u> <u>subclasses</u> <u>only.</u>  We have decided on an output directory and tentative filename, but
           there is a chance that it might already exist.  Keep adding a numeric suffix "-1", "-2", etc. to  the
           filename until an unused path is found, and then return that path.

           The suffix is actually added before the first "." in the filename is there is one; for example:

               picture.gif       archive.tar.gz      readme
               picture-1.gif     archive-1.tar.gz    readme-1
               picture-2.gif     archive-2.tar.gz    readme-2
               ...               ...                 ...
               picture-10.gif
               ...

           This  can  be  a  costly  operation, and risky if you don't want files renamed, so it is in your best
           interest to minimize situations where these kinds of collisions occur.  Unfortunately, if a multipart
           message gives all of its parts the same recommended filename, and you are placing  them  all  in  the
           same directory, this method might be unavoidable.

       ignore_filename [YESNO]
           <u>Instance</u>  <u>method.</u>  Return true if we should always ignore recommended filenames in messages, choosing
           instead to always generate our own filenames.  With argument, sets this value.

           <b>Note:</b> subclasses of MIME::Parser::Filer which override <b>output_path()</b> might not  honor  this  setting;
           note, however, that the built-in subclasses honor it.

       output_dir HEAD
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Return the output directory for the given header.  The default method returns ".".

       output_filename HEAD
           <u>Instance</u>  <u>method,</u>  <u>subclasses</u>  <u>only.</u>   A  given  recommended filename was either not given, or it was
           judged to be evil.  Return a fake name, possibly using information in the message HEADer.  Note  that
           this is just the filename, not the full path.

           Used  by  <b>output_path()</b>.  If you're using the default output_path(), you probably don't need to worry
           about avoiding collisions with existing files; we take care of that in <b>find_unused_path()</b>.

       output_prefix [PREFIX]
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Get the short string that all filenames for extracted body-parts  will  begin  with
           (assuming that there is no better "recommended filename").  The default is <u>"msg"</u>.

           If PREFIX <u>is</u> <u>not</u> given, the current output prefix is returned.  If PREFIX <u>is</u> given, the output prefix
           is set to the new value, and the previous value is returned.

           Used by <b>output_filename()</b>.

           <b>Note:</b>  subclasses  of MIME::Parser::Filer which override <b>output_path()</b> or <b>output_filename()</b> might not
           honor this setting; note, however, that the built-in subclasses honor it.

       output_type_ext
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Return a reference to the hash used by the default  <b>output_filename()</b>  for  mapping
           from content-types to extensions when there is no default extension to use.

               $emap = $filer-&gt;output_typemap;
               $emap-&gt;{'text/plain'} = '.txt';
               $emap-&gt;{'text/html'}  = '.html';
               $emap-&gt;{'text/*'}     = '.txt';
               $emap-&gt;{'*/*'}        = '.dat';

           <b>Note:</b>  subclasses  of MIME::Parser::Filer which override <b>output_path()</b> or <b>output_filename()</b> might not
           consult this hash; note, however, that the built-in subclasses consult it.

       output_path HEAD
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method,</u> <u>subclasses</u> <u>only.</u>  Given a MIME head for a file to be extracted, come up with a  good
           output  pathname  for the extracted file.  This is the only method you need to worry about if you are
           building a custom filer.

           The default implementation does a lot of work;  subclass  implementers  <u>really</u>  should  try  to  just
           override its components instead of the whole thing.  It works basically as follows:

               $directory = $self-&gt;output_dir($head);

               $filename = $head-&gt;recommended_filename();
               if (!$filename or
                    $self-&gt;ignore_filename() or
                    $self-&gt;evil_filename($filename)) {
                   $filename = $self-&gt;output_filename($head);
               }

               return $self-&gt;find_unused_path($directory, $filename);

           <b>Note:</b>  There  are  many, many, many ways you might want to control the naming of files, based on your
           application.  If you don't like the behavior of  this  function,  you  can  easily  define  your  own
           subclass of MIME::Parser::Filer and override it there.

           <b>Note:</b>  Nickolay  Saukh pointed out that, given the subjective nature of what is "evil", this function
           really shouldn't <u>warn</u> about an evil filename, but maybe just issue a  <u>debug</u>  message.   I  considered
           that,  but  then  I  thought:  if  debugging  were off, people wouldn't know why (or even if) a given
           filename had been ignored.  In mail robots that depend on externally-provided filenames,  this  could
           cause hard-to-diagnose problems.  So, the message is still a warning.

           <u>Thanks</u>  <u>to</u>  <u>Laurent</u>  <u>Amon</u>  <u>for</u> <u>pointing</u> <u>out</u> <u>problems</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>original</u> <u>implementation,</u> <u>and</u> <u>for</u> <u>making</u>
           <u>some</u> <u>good</u> <u>suggestions.</u>  <u>Thanks</u> <u>also</u> <u>to</u> <u>Achim</u> <u>Bohnet</u> <u>for</u> <u>pointing</u> <u>out</u> <u>that</u> <u>there</u> <u>should</u> <u>be</u> <u>a</u> <u>hookless,</u>
           <u>OO</u> <u>way</u> <u>of</u> <u>overriding</u> <u>the</u> <u>output</u> <u>path.</u>

       purge
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method,</u> <u>final.</u>  Purge all files/directories created by the last parse.  This  method  simply
           goes  through  the  purgeable  list  in  reverse  order  (see  "purgeable")  and removes all existing
           files/directories in it.  You should not need to override this method.

       purgeable [FILE]
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method,</u> <u>final.</u>  Add FILE to the list of "purgeable" files/directories (those which  will  be
           removed if you do a purge()).  You should not need to override this method.

           If  FILE  is  not  given,  the "purgeable" list is returned.  This may be used for more-sophisticated
           purging.

           As a special case, invoking this method with a FILE that is an arrayref will  replace  the  purgeable
           list with a copy of the array's contents, so [] may be used to clear the list.

           Note that the "purgeable" list is cleared when a parser begins a new parse; therefore, if you want to
           use <b>purge()</b> to do cleanup, you <u>must</u> do so <u>before</u> starting a new parse!

   <b>MIME::Parser::FileInto</b>
       This concrete subclass of MIME::Parser::Filer supports filing into a given directory.

       init DIRECTORY
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method,</u> <u>initiallizer.</u>  Set the directory where all files will go.

   <b>MIME::Parser::FileUnder</b>
       This  concrete  subclass  of  MIME::Parser::Filer  supports  filing  under  a  given directory, using one
       subdirectory per message, but with all message parts in the same directory.

       init BASEDIR, OPTSHASH...
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method,</u> <u>initiallizer.</u>  Set the base directory which will contain  the  message  directories.
           If  used,  then each parse of begins by creating a new subdirectory of BASEDIR where the actual parts
           of the message are placed.  OPTSHASH can contain the following:

           DirName
               Explicitly set the name of the subdirectory which is created.  The default is to  use  the  time,
               process id, and a sequence number, but you might want a predictable directory.

           Purge
               Automatically  purge  the  contents  of  the directory (including all subdirectories) before each
               parse.  This is really only needed if using an explicit DirName, and is provided as a convenience
               only.  Currently we use the 1-arg form of File::Path::rmtree;  you  should  familiarize  yourself
               with the caveats therein.

           The  <b>output_dir()</b>  will  return  the  path to this message-specific directory until the next parse is
           begun, so you can do this:

               use File::Path;

               $parser-&gt;output_under("<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>");
               $ent = eval { $parser-&gt;parse_open($msg); };   ### parse
               if (!$ent) {         ### parse failed
                   rmtree($parser-&gt;output_dir);
                   die "parse failed: $@";
               }
               else {               ### parse succeeded
                   ...do stuff...
               }
