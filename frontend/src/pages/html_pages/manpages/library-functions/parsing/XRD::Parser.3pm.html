       XRD::Parser - parse XRD and host-meta files into RDF::Trine models

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use RDF::Query;
         use XRD::Parser;

         my $parser = XRD::Parser-&gt;new(undef, "<a href="http://example.com/foo.xrd">http://example.com/foo.xrd</a>");
         my $results = RDF::Query-&gt;new(
           "SELECT * WHERE {?who &lt;<a href="http://spec.example.net/auth/1.0">http://spec.example.net/auth/1.0</a>&gt; ?auth.}")
           -&gt;execute($parser-&gt;graph);

         while (my $result = $results-&gt;next)
         {
           print $result-&gt;{'auth'}-&gt;uri . "\n";
         }

       or maybe:

         my $data = XRD::Parser-&gt;hostmeta('gmail.com')
                                 -&gt;graph
                                   -&gt;as_hashref;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       While XRD has a rather different history, it turns out it can mostly be thought of as a serialisation
       format for a limited subset of RDF.

       This package ignores the order of &lt;Link&gt; elements, as RDF is a graph format with no concept of statements
       coming in an "order". The XRD spec says that grokking the order of &lt;Link&gt; elements is only a SHOULD. That
       said, if you're concerned about the order of &lt;Link&gt; elements, the callback routines allowed by this
       package may be of use.

       This package aims to be roughly compatible with RDF::RDFa::Parser's interface.

   <b>Constructors</b>
       "$p = XRD::Parser-&gt;new($content, $uri, [\%options], [$store])"
           This method creates a new XRD::Parser object and returns it.

           The  $content  variable  may  contain  an  XML  string, or a XML::LibXML::Document.  If a string, the
           document is parsed using XML::LibXML::Parser, which may throw  an  exception.  XRD::Parser  does  not
           catch the exception.

           $uri the base URI of the content; it is used to resolve any relative URIs found in the XRD document.

           Options [default in brackets]:

           •       <b>default_subject</b> - If no &lt;Subject&gt; element. [undef]

           •       <b>link_prop</b> - How to handle &lt;Property&gt; in &lt;Link&gt;?  0=skip, 1=reify, 2=subproperty, 3=both. [0]

           •       <b>loose_mime</b> - Accept text/plain, text/html and application/octet-stream media types. [0]

           •       <b>tdb_service</b> - Use thing-described-by.org when possible. [0]

           $storage is an RDF::Trine::Storage object. If undef, then a new temporary store is created.

       "$p = XRD::Parser-&gt;new_from_url($url, [\%options], [$storage])"
           $url is a URL to fetch and parse.

           This function can also be called as "new_from_uri". Same thing.

       "$p = XRD::Parser-&gt;hostmeta($uri)"
           This method creates a new XRD::Parser object and returns it.

           The parameter may be a URI (from which the hostname will be extracted) or just a bare host name (e.g.
           "example.com").  The  resource  "/.well-known/host-meta" will then be fetched from that host using an
           appropriate HTTP Accept header, and the parser object returned.

   <b>Public</b> <b>Methods</b>
       "$p-&gt;uri($uri)"
           Returns the base URI of the document being parsed. This will usually be the  same  as  the  base  URI
           provided to the constructor.

           Optionally  it may be passed a parameter - an absolute or relative URI - in which case it returns the
           same URI which it was passed as a parameter, but  as  an  absolute  URI,  resolved  relative  to  the
           document's base URI.

           This  seems  like  two unrelated functions, but if you consider the consequence of passing a relative
           URI consisting of a zero-length string, it in fact makes sense.

       "$p-&gt;dom"
           Returns the parsed XML::LibXML::Document.

       "$p-&gt;graph"
           This method will return an RDF::Trine::Model object with all statements of the full graph.

           This method will automatically call "consume" first, if it has not already been called.

       $p-&gt;set_callbacks(\%callbacks)
           Set callback functions for the parser to call on certain events. These are only necessary if you want
           to do something especially unusual.

             $p-&gt;set_callbacks({
               'pretriple_resource' =&gt; sub { ... } ,
               'pretriple_literal'  =&gt; sub { ... } ,
               'ontriple'           =&gt; undef ,
               });

           Either of the two pretriple callbacks can be set to the string 'print' instead of  a  coderef.   This
           enables built-in callbacks for printing Turtle to STDOUT.

           For details of the callback functions, see the section CALLBACKS. "set_callbacks" must be used <u>before</u>
           "consume". "set_callbacks" itself returns a reference to the parser object itself.

           <u>NOTE:</u> the behaviour of this function was changed in version 0.05.

       "$p-&gt;consume"
           This  method  processes  the  input DOM and sends the resulting triples to the callback functions (if
           any).

           It called again, does nothing.

           Returns the parser object itself.

   <b>Utility</b> <b>Functions</b>
       "$host_uri = XRD::Parser::host_uri($uri)"
           Returns a URI representing the host. These crop up often in graphs gleaned from host-meta files.

           $uri can be an absolute URI like '<a href="http://example.net/foo">http://example.net/foo</a>#bar' or a host name like 'example.com'.

       "$uri = XRD::Parser::template_uri($relationship_uri)"
           Returns a URI representing not a normal relationship, but the  relationship  between  a  host  and  a
           template URI literal.

       "$hostmeta_uri = XRD::Parser::hostmeta_location($host)"
           The parameter may be a URI (from which the hostname will be extracted) or just a bare host name (e.g.
           "example.com").  The  location  for  a  host-meta  file  relevant  to  the  host  of that URI will be
           calculated.

           If called in list context, returns an 'https' URI and an 'http' URI as a list.

</pre><h4><b>CALLBACKS</b></h4><pre>
       Several callback functions are provided. These may be  set  using  the  "set_callbacks"  function,  which
       taskes a hashref of keys pointing to coderefs. The keys are named for the event to fire the callback on.

   <b>pretriple_resource</b>
       This  is called when a triple has been found, but before preparing the triple for adding to the model. It
       is only called for triples with a non-literal object value.

       The parameters passed to the callback function are:

       •   A reference to the "XRD::Parser" object

       •   A reference to the "XML::LibXML::Element" being parsed

       •   Subject URI or bnode (string)

       •   Predicate URI (string)

       •   Object URI or bnode (string)

       The callback should return 1 to tell the parser to skip this triple (not add it to the graph);  return  0
       otherwise.

   <b>pretriple_literal</b>
       This is the equivalent of pretriple_resource, but is only called for triples with a literal object value.

       The parameters passed to the callback function are:

       •   A reference to the "XRD::Parser" object

       •   A reference to the "XML::LibXML::Element" being parsed

       •   Subject URI or bnode (string)

       •   Predicate URI (string)

       •   Object literal (string)

       •   Datatype URI (string or undef)

       •   Language (string or undef)

       The  callback  should return 1 to tell the parser to skip this triple (not add it to the graph); return 0
       otherwise.

   <b>ontriple</b>
       This is called once a triple is ready to be added to the graph.  (After  the  pretriple  callbacks.)  The
       parameters passed to the callback function are:

       •   A reference to the "XRD::Parser" object

       •   A reference to the "XML::LibXML::Element" being parsed

       •   An RDF::Trine::Statement object.

       The  callback  should return 1 to tell the parser to skip this triple (not add it to the graph); return 0
       otherwise. The callback may modify the RDF::Trine::Statement object.

</pre><h4><b>WHY</b> <b>RDF?</b></h4><pre>
       It abstracts away the structure of the XRD file, exposing just the meaning of its contents. Two XRD files
       with the same meaning should end up producing more or less  the  same  RDF  data,  even  if  they  differ
       significantly at the syntactic level.

       If you care about the syntax of an XRD file, then use XML::LibXML.
