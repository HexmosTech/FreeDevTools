</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Are  you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In that case please read the overview
       provided by the <u>Introduction</u> <u>to</u> <u>Parser</u> <u>Tools</u>. This document is the entrypoint to  the  whole  system  the
       current package is a part of.

       This  document  describes  two  APIs.  First the API shared by all packages for the conversion of Parsing
       Expression Grammars into some other format, and then the API shared by the packages which  implement  the
       export plugins sitting on top of the conversion packages.

       Its  intended  audience are people who wish to create their own converter for some type of output, and/or
       an export plugin for their or some other converter.

       It resides in the Export section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools.

       IMAGE: arch_core_export

</pre><h4><b>CONVERTER</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       Any (grammar) export converter has to follow the rules set out below:

       [1]    A converter is a package. Its name is arbitrary, however it is recommended to  put  it  under  the
              <b>::pt::peg::to</b> namespace.

       [2]    The  package  provides  either  a  single Tcl command following the API outlined below, or a class
              command whose instances follow the same  API.  The  commands  which  follow  the  API  are  called
              <u>converter</u> <u>commands</u>.

       [3]    A  converter  command  has  to  provide  the following three methods with the given signatures and
              semantics. Converter commands are allowed to provide more methods of their own, but not less,  and
              they may not provide different semantics for the standardized methods.

              <b>CONVERTER</b> <b>reset</b>
                     This  method  has  to reset the configuration of the converter to its default settings. The
                     result of the method has to be the empty string.

              <b>CONVERTER</b> <b>configure</b>
                     This method, in this form, has to return a dictionary containing the current  configuration
                     of the converter.

              <b>CONVERTER</b> <b>configure</b> <u>option</u>
                     This  method,  in this form, has to return the current value of the specified configuration
                     <u>option</u> of the converter.

                     Please read the section <b>Options</b> for the set  of  standard  options  any  converter  has  to
                     accept.   Any  other  options  accepted  by  a  specific converter will be described in its
                     manpage.

              <b>CONVERTER</b> <b>configure</b> <u>option</u> <u>value</u>...
                     This command, in this form, sets the specified  <u>option</u>s  of  the  converter  to  the  given
                     <u>value</u>s.

                     Please  read the section <b>Options</b> for the set of standard options a converter has to accept.
                     Any other options accepted by a specific converter will be described in its manpage.

              <b>CONVERTER</b> <b>convert</b> <u>serial</u>
                     This method has to accept the canonical serialization of a parsing expression  grammar,  as
                     specified  in section <b>PEG</b> <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>, and contained in <u>serial</u>.  The result of the
                     method has to be the result of converting the input grammar into whatever the converter  is
                     for, per its configuration.

</pre><h4><b>PLUGIN</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       Any (grammar) export plugin has to follow the rules set out below:

       [1]    A plugin is a package.

       [2]    The  name  of  a  plugin  package  has the form pt::peg::export::<b>FOO</b>, where <b>FOO</b> is the name of the
              format the plugin will generate output for.

       [3]    The plugin can expect that the package <b>pt::peg::export::plugin</b> is present, as  indicator  that  it
              was invoked from a genuine plugin manager.

              It is recommended that a plugin does check for the presence of this package.

       [4]    A plugin has to provide a single command, in the global namespace, with the signature shown below.
              Plugins  are  allowed to provide more command of their own, but not less, and they may not provide
              different semantics for the standardized command.

              <b>::export</b> <u>serial</u> <u>configuration</u>
                     This command has to accept the canonical serialization of a parsing expression grammar  and
                     the configuration for the converter invoked by the plugin. The result of the command has to
                     be  the  result  of  the  converter  invoked  by  the  plugin  for  th  input  grammar  and
                     configuration.

                     string <u>serial</u>
                            This argument will contain the <u>canonical</u> serialization  of  the  parsing  expression
                            grammar  for  which  to  generate the output.  The specification of what a <u>canonical</u>
                            serialization is can be found in the section <b>PEG</b> <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>.

                     dictionary <u>configuration</u>
                            This argument will contain the configuration to configure the converter with  before
                            invoking it, as a dictionary mapping from options to values.

                            Please read the section <b>Options</b> for the set of standard options any converter has to
                            accept,  and  thus  any  plugin  as  well.  Any other options accepted by a specific
                            plugin will be described in its manpage.

       [5]    A single usage cycle of a plugin consists of an invokation of the command <b>export</b>. This call has to
              leave the plugin in a state where another usage cycle can be run without problems.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Each export converter and plugin for an export converter  has  to  accept  the  options  below  in  their
       <b>configure</b>  method.  Converters  are  allowed  to  ignore  the contents of these options when performing a
       conversion, but they must not reject them. Plugins are expected to pass the options given to them to  the
       converter they are invoking.

       <b>-file</b> string
              The  value of this option is the name of the file or other entity from which the grammar came, for
              which the command is run. The default value is <b>unknown</b>.

       <b>-name</b> string
              The value of this option is the name of the grammar we  are  processing.   The  default  value  is
              <b>a_pe_grammar</b>.

       <b>-user</b> string
              The  value  of this option is the name of the user for which the command is run. The default value
              is <b>unknown</b>.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       To use a converter do

                  # Get the converter (single command here, not class)
                  package require the-converter-package

                  # Provide a configuration
                  theconverter configure ...

                  # Perform the conversion
                  set result [theconverter convert $thegrammarserial]

                  ... process the result ...

       To use a plugin <b>FOO</b> do

                  # Get an export plugin manager
                  package require pt::peg::export
                  pt::peg::export E

                  # Provide a configuration
                  E configuration set ...

                  # Run the plugin, and the converter inside.
                  set result [E export serial $grammarserial FOO]

                  ... process the result ...

</pre><h4><b>PEG</b> <b>SERIALIZATION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Parsing Expression Grammars as immutable
       values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between <u>regular</u> and <u>canonical</u> serializations.  While a PEG may have more than one  regular
       serialization only exactly one of them will be <u>canonical</u>.

       regular serialization

              [1]    The serialization of any PEG is a nested Tcl dictionary.

              [2]    This  dictionary  holds a single key, <b>pt::grammar::peg</b>, and its value. This value holds the
                     contents of the grammar.

              [3]    The contents of the grammar are a Tcl dictionary holding the set of nonterminal symbols and
                     the starting expression. The relevant keys and their values are

                     <b>rules</b>  The value is a Tcl dictionary whose keys are the names of  the  nonterminal  symbols
                            known to the grammar.

                            [1]    Each nonterminal symbol may occur only once.

                            [2]    The empty string is not a legal nonterminal symbol.

                            [3]    The  value  for each symbol is a Tcl dictionary itself. The relevant keys and
                                   their values in this dictionary are

                                   <b>is</b>     The value is the serialization of the  parsing  expression  describing
                                          the  symbols  sentennial  structure,  as  specified  in the section <b>PE</b>
                                          <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>.

                                   <b>mode</b>   The value can be one of three values specifying how  a  parser  should
                                          handle the semantic value produced by the symbol.

                                          <b>value</b>  The  semantic  value  of  the nonterminal symbol is an abstract
                                                 syntax  tree  consisting  of  a  single  node  node   for   the
                                                 nonterminal  itself,  which  has the ASTs of the symbol's right
                                                 hand side as its children.

                                          <b>leaf</b>   The semantic value of the nonterminal  symbol  is  an  abstract
                                                 syntax   tree   consisting  of  a  single  node  node  for  the
                                                 nonterminal, without any children. Any ASTs  generated  by  the
                                                 symbol's right hand side are discarded.

                                          <b>void</b>   The  nonterminal  has  no semantic value. Any ASTs generated by
                                                 the symbol's right hand side are discarded (as well).

                     <b>start</b>  The value is the serialization of the start parsing expression of  the  grammar,  as
                            specified in the section <b>PE</b> <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>.

              [4]    The  terminal  symbols  of  the grammar are specified implicitly as the set of all terminal
                     symbols used in the start expression and on the RHS of the grammar rules.

       canonical serialization
              The canonical serialization of a grammar has the format as specified in  the  previous  item,  and
              then  additionally  satisfies  the  constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
              serializations of this grammar.

              [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are sorted in ascending dictionary order,
                     as generated by Tcl's builtin command <b>lsort</b> <b>-increasing</b> <b>-dict</b>.

              [2]    The string representation of the value is the canonical representation of a Tcl dictionary.
                     I.e. it does not contain superfluous whitespace.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       Assuming the following PEG for simple mathematical expressions

              PEG calculator (Expression)
                  Digit      &lt;- '0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'       ;
                  Sign       &lt;- '-' / '+'                                     ;
                  Number     &lt;- Sign? Digit+                                  ;
                  Expression &lt;- Term (AddOp Term)*                            ;
                  MulOp      &lt;- '*' / '/'                                     ;
                  Term       &lt;- Factor (MulOp Factor)*                        ;
                  AddOp      &lt;- '+'/'-'                                       ;
                  Factor     &lt;- '(' Expression ')' / Number                   ;
              END;

       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is

              pt::grammar::peg {
                  rules {
                      AddOp      {is {/ {t -} {t +}}                                                                mode value}
                      Digit      {is {/ {t 0} {t 1} {t 2} {t 3} {t 4} {t 5} {t 6} {t 7} {t 8} {t 9}}                mode value}
                      Expression {is {x {n Term} {* {x {n AddOp} {n Term}}}}                                        mode value}
                      Factor     {is {/ {x {t (} {n Expression} {t )}} {n Number}}                                  mode value}
                      MulOp      {is {/ {t *} {t /}}                                                                mode value}
                      Number     {is {x {? {n Sign}} {+ {n Digit}}}                                                 mode value}
                      Sign       {is {/ {t -} {t +}}                                                                mode value}
                      Term       {is {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}                                    mode value}
                  }
                  start {n Expression}
              }

</pre><h4><b>PE</b> <b>SERIALIZATION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Parsing Expressions as immutable  values
       for transport, comparison, etc.

       We  distinguish  between  <u>regular</u> and <u>canonical</u> serializations.  While a parsing expression may have more
       than one regular serialization only exactly one of them will be <u>canonical</u>.

       Regular serialization

              <b>Atomic</b> <b>Parsing</b> <b>Expressions</b>

                     [1]    The string <b>epsilon</b> is an atomic parsing expression. It matches the empty string.

                     [2]    The string <b>dot</b> is an atomic parsing expression. It matches any character.

                     [3]    The string <b>alnum</b> is an atomic parsing expression. It matches any Unicode alphabet or
                            digit character. This is a custom extension of PEs based on  Tcl's  builtin  command
                            <b>string</b> <b>is</b>.

              <b>Combined</b> <b>Parsing</b> <b>Expressions</b>

                     [1]    For  parsing  expressions <b>e1</b>, <b>e2</b>, ... the result of [list / <b>e1</b> <b>e2</b> ... ] is a parsing
                            expression as well.  This is the <u>ordered</u> <u>choice</u>, aka <u>prioritized</u> <u>choice</u>.

                     [2]    For parsing expressions <b>e1</b>, <b>e2</b>, ... the result of [list x <b>e1</b> <b>e2</b> ... ] is  a  parsing
                            expression as well.  This is the <u>sequence</u>.

                     [3]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list * <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>kleene</u> <u>closure</u>, describing zero or more repetitions.

                     [4]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list + <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>positive</u> <u>kleene</u> <u>closure</u>, describing one or more repetitions.

                     [5]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list &amp; <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>and</u> <u>lookahead</u> <u>predicate</u>.

                     [6]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list ! <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>not</u> <u>lookahead</u> <u>predicate</u>.

                     [7]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list ? <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>optional</u> <u>input</u>.

       Canonical serialization
              The  canonical  serialization  of a parsing expression has the format as specified in the previous
              item, and then additionally satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique  among  all  the
              possible serializations of this parsing expression.

              [1]    The  string representation of the value is the canonical representation of a pure Tcl list.
                     I.e. it does not contain superfluous whitespace.

              [2]    Terminals are <u>not</u> encoded as ranges (where start and end of the range are identical).

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       Assuming the parsing expression shown on the right-hand side of the rule

                  Expression &lt;- Term (AddOp Term)*

       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is

                  {x {n Term} {* {x {n AddOp} {n Term}}}}
