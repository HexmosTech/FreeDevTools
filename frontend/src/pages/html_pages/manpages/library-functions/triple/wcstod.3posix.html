</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wcstod, wcstof, wcstold — convert a wide-character string to a double-precision number

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/wchar.h">wchar.h</a>&gt;

       double wcstod(const wchar_t *restrict <u>nptr</u>, wchar_t **restrict <u>endptr</u>);
       float wcstof(const wchar_t *restrict <u>nptr</u>, wchar_t **restrict <u>endptr</u>);
       long double wcstold(const wchar_t *restrict <u>nptr</u>,
           wchar_t **restrict <u>endptr</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       These  functions  shall  convert  the  initial portion of the wide-character string pointed to by <u>nptr</u> to
       <b>double</b>, <b>float</b>, and <b>long</b> <b>double</b> representation, respectively. First, they shall decompose the input  wide-
       character string into three parts:

        1. An initial, possibly empty, sequence of white-space wide-character codes (as specified by <u>iswspace</u>())

        2. A subject sequence interpreted as a floating-point constant or representing infinity or NaN

        3. A  final  wide-character  string  of  one  or  more  unrecognized wide-character codes, including the
           terminating null wide-character code of the input wide-character string

       Then they shall attempt to convert the subject sequence  to  a  floating-point  number,  and  return  the
       result.

       The expected form of the subject sequence is an optional <b>'+'</b> or <b>'-'</b> sign, then one of the following:

        *  A  non-empty  sequence  of  decimal  digits optionally containing a radix character; then an optional
           exponent part consisting of the wide character <b>'e'</b> or the wide character <b>'E'</b>, optionally followed  by
           a <b>'+'</b> or <b>'-'</b> wide character, and then followed by one or more decimal digits

        *  A  0x or 0X, then a non-empty sequence of hexadecimal digits optionally containing a radix character;
           then an optional binary exponent part consisting of the wide character <b>'p'</b> or the wide character <b>'P'</b>,
           optionally followed by a <b>'+'</b> or <b>'-'</b> wide character, and then followed by one or more decimal digits

        *  One of INF or INFINITY, or any other wide string equivalent except for case

        *  One of NAN or NAN(<u>n-wchar-sequenceopt</u>), or any other wide string  ignoring  case  in  the  NAN  part,
           where:

               n-wchar-sequence:
                   digit
                   nondigit
                   n-wchar-sequence digit
                   n-wchar-sequence nondigit

       The  subject  sequence  is  defined as the longest initial subsequence of the input wide string, starting
       with the first non-white-space wide character, that  is  of  the  expected  form.  The  subject  sequence
       contains no wide characters if the input wide string is not of the expected form.

       If  the  subject  sequence  has  the  expected  form  for  a  floating-point number, the sequence of wide
       characters starting with the first digit or  the  radix  character  (whichever  occurs  first)  shall  be
       interpreted  as  a  floating  constant  according  to  the rules of the C language, except that the radix
       character shall be used in place of a period, and that if neither an exponent part nor a radix  character
       appears in a decimal floating-point number, or if a binary exponent part does not appear in a hexadecimal
       floating-point  number,  an  exponent  part  of  the appropriate type with value zero shall be assumed to
       follow the last digit in the string. If the subject sequence begins with a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;,  the  sequence
       shall  be  interpreted  as  negated. A wide-character sequence INF or INFINITY shall be interpreted as an
       infinity, if representable in the return type, else as if it were a floating constant that is  too  large
       for  the  range  of  the  return type. A wide-character sequence NAN or NAN(<u>n-wchar-sequenceopt</u>) shall be
       interpreted as a quiet NaN, if supported in the return type, else as if it were a subject  sequence  part
       that  does  not have the expected form; the meaning of the <u>n</u>-wchar sequences is implementation-defined. A
       pointer to the final wide string shall be stored in the object pointed to by <u>endptr</u>, provided that <u>endptr</u>
       is not a null pointer.

       If the subject sequence has the hexadecimal form and FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, the conversion  shall  be
       rounded in an implementation-defined manner.

       The  radix  character  shall  be  as  defined  in the current locale (category <u>LC_NUMERIC</u>).  In the POSIX
       locale, or in a locale where the radix character is not defined, the radix character shall default  to  a
       &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>).

       In other than the C or POSIX locale, additional locale-specific subject sequence forms may be accepted.

       If  the  subject  sequence is empty or does not have the expected form, no conversion shall be performed;
       the value of <u>nptr</u> shall be stored in the object pointed to by <u>endptr</u>, provided that <u>endptr</u> is not a  null
       pointer.

       These functions shall not change the setting of <u>errno</u> if successful.

       Since  0  is returned on error and is also a valid return on success, an application wishing to check for
       error situations should set <u>errno</u> to 0, then call <u>wcstod</u>(), <u>wcstof</u>(), or <u>wcstold</u>(), then check <u>errno</u>.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the converted value. If no conversion  could  be
       performed, 0 shall be returned and <u>errno</u> may be set to <b>[EINVAL]</b>.

       If  the  correct value is outside the range of representable values, ±HUGE_VAL, ±HUGE_VALF, or ±HUGE_VALL
       shall be returned (according to the sign of the value), and <u>errno</u> shall be set to <b>[ERANGE]</b>.

       If the correct value would cause underflow, a value whose magnitude  is  no  greater  than  the  smallest
       normalized positive number in the return type shall be returned and <u>errno</u> set to <b>[ERANGE]</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>wcstod</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ERANGE</b> The value to be returned would cause overflow or underflow.

       The <u>wcstod</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> No conversion could be performed.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       If the subject sequence has the hexadecimal form and FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, and the result is not
       exactly  representable,  the  result  should be one of the two numbers in the appropriate internal format
       that are adjacent to the hexadecimal floating source value, with the extra  stipulation  that  the  error
       should have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.

       If  the  subject sequence has the decimal form and at most DECIMAL_DIG (defined in <u>&lt;float.h&gt;</u>) significant
       digits, the result should be correctly rounded. If the subject sequence <u>D</u> has the decimal form  and  more
       than  DECIMAL_DIG  significant  digits, consider the two bounding, adjacent decimal strings <u>L</u> and <u>U</u>, both
       having DECIMAL_DIG significant digits, such that the values of <u>L</u>, <u>D</u>, and <u>U</u> satisfy <b>"L</b>&lt;=<b>D</b>&lt;=<b>U"</b>.  The result
       should be one of the (equal or adjacent) values that would be obtained by  correctly  rounding  <u>L</u>  and  <u>U</u>
       according  to the current rounding direction, with the extra stipulation that the error with respect to <u>D</u>
       should have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
