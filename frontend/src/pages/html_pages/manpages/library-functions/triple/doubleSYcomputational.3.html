       <b>DLA_SYAMV</b> computes a matrix-vector product using a symmetric indefinite matrix to calculate error bounds.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DLA_SYAMV  performs the matrix-vector operation

                    y := alpha*abs(A)*abs(x) + beta*abs(y),

            where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are vectors and A is an
            n by n symmetric matrix.

            This function is primarily used in calculating error bounds.
            To protect against underflow during evaluation, components in
            the resulting vector are perturbed away from zero by (N+1)
            times the underflow threshold.  To prevent unnecessarily large
            errors for block-structure embedded in general matrices,
            "symbolically" zero components are not perturbed.  A zero
            entry is considered "symbolic" if all multiplications involved
            in computing that entry have at least one zero multiplicand.

       <b>DLA_SYRCOND</b> estimates the Skeel condition number for a symmetric indefinite matrix.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

               DLA_SYRCOND estimates the Skeel condition number of  op(A) * op2(C)

       <b>DLA_SYRFSX_EXTENDED</b> improves the computed solution to a system of linear equations for symmetric
       indefinite matrices by performing extra-precise iterative refinement and provides error bounds and
       backward error estimates for the solution.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DLA_SYRFSX_EXTENDED improves the computed solution to a system of
            linear equations by performing extra-precise iterative refinement
            and provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.
            This subroutine is called by DSYRFSX to perform iterative refinement.
            In addition to normwise error bound, the code provides maximum
            componentwise error bound if possible. See comments for ERR_BNDS_NORM
            and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the error bounds. Note that this
            subroutine is only resonsible for setting the second fields of
            ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP.

       <b>Parameters</b>

                Specifies the intermediate precision to be used in refinement.
                The value is defined by ILAPREC(P) where P is a CHARACTER and P
                     = 'S':  Single
                     = 'D':  Double
                     = 'I':  Indigenous
                     = 'X' or 'E':  Extra

           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                  = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
                  = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
                matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>NRHS</u>

                     NRHS is INTEGER
                The number of right-hand-sides, i.e., the number of columns of the
                matrix B.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
                On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>AF</u>

                     AF is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAF,N)
                The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
                obtain the factor U or L as computed by DSYTRF.

           <u>LDAF</u>

                     LDAF is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>IPIV</u>

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
                as determined by DSYTRF.

           <u>COLEQU</u>

                     COLEQU is LOGICAL
                If .TRUE. then column equilibration was done to A before calling
                this routine. This is needed to compute the solution and error
                bounds correctly.

           <u>C</u>

                     C is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
                The column scale factors for A. If COLEQU = .FALSE., C
                is not accessed. If C is input, each element of C should be a power
                of the radix to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates.
                Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless
                the result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
                lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
                input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
                reliable.

           <u>B</u>

           <u>Y</u>

                     Y is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDY,NRHS)
                On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by DSYTRS.
                On exit, the improved solution matrix Y.

           <u>LDY</u>

                     LDY is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array Y.  LDY &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>BERR_OUT</u>

                     BERR_OUT is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
                On exit, BERR_OUT(j) contains the componentwise relative backward
                error for right-hand-side j from the formula
                    max(i) ( abs(RES(i)) / ( abs(op(A_s))*abs(Y) + abs(B_s) )(i) )
                where abs(Z) is the componentwise absolute value of the matrix
                or vector Z. This is computed by DLA_LIN_BERR.

           <u>N_NORMS</u>

                     N_NORMS is INTEGER
                Determines which error bounds to return (see ERR_BNDS_NORM
                and ERR_BNDS_COMP).
                If N_NORMS &gt;= 1 return normwise error bounds.
                If N_NORMS &gt;= 2 return componentwise error bounds.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_NORM</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_NORM is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                        max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
                       ------------------------------
                             max_j abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
                below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
                returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
                         radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

                This subroutine is only responsible for setting the second field
                above.
                See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
                cautions.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_COMP</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_COMP is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                               abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
                        max_j ----------------------
                                    abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
                componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
                information as described below. There currently are up to three
                pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
                componentwise accuracy is not requested (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 0.0), then
                ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS &lt; 3, then at most
                the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
                         current right-hand side and S scales each row of
                         A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
                         sums of Z are approximately 1.

                This subroutine is only responsible for setting the second field

                See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
                cautions.

           <u>RES</u>

                     RES is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
                Workspace to hold the intermediate residual.

           <u>AYB</u>

                     AYB is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
                Workspace. This can be the same workspace passed for Y_TAIL.

           <u>DY</u>

                     DY is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
                Workspace to hold the intermediate solution.

           <u>Y_TAIL</u>

                     Y_TAIL is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
                Workspace to hold the trailing bits of the intermediate solution.

           <u>RCOND</u>

                     RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
                Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
                reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
                equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
                precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
                to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
                if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
                conditioned.

           <u>ITHRESH</u>

                     ITHRESH is INTEGER
                The maximum number of residual computations allowed for
                refinement. The default is 10. For 'aggressive' set to 100 to
                permit convergence using approximate factorizations or
                factorizations other than LU. If the factorization uses a
                technique other than Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
                ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP may no longer be trustworthy.

           <u>RTHRESH</u>

                     RTHRESH is DOUBLE PRECISION
                Determines when to stop refinement if the error estimate stops
                decreasing. Refinement will stop when the next solution no longer
                satisfies norm(dx_{i+1}) &lt; RTHRESH * norm(dx_i) where norm(Z) is
                the infinity norm of Z. RTHRESH satisfies 0 &lt; RTHRESH &lt;= 1. The
                default value is 0.5. For 'aggressive' set to 0.9 to permit
                convergence on extremely ill-conditioned matrices. See LAWN 165
                for more details.

           <u>DZ_UB</u>

                     DZ_UB is DOUBLE PRECISION
                Determines when to start considering componentwise convergence.
                Componentwise convergence is only considered after each component
                of the solution Y is stable, which we define as the relative
                change in each component being less than DZ_UB. The default value
                is 0.25, requiring the first bit to be stable. See LAWN 165 for
                more details.

           <u>IGNORE_CWISE</u>

                     IGNORE_CWISE is LOGICAL
                If .TRUE. then ignore componentwise convergence. Default value
                is .FALSE..

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                  = 0:  Successful exit.
                  &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the ith argument to DLA_SYRFSX_EXTENDED had an illegal
                        value

       <b>DLA_SYRPVGRW</b> computes the reciprocal pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U) for a symmetric indefinite
       matrix.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DLA_SYRPVGRW computes the reciprocal pivot growth factor
            norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element" norm is used. If this is
            much less than 1, the stability of the LU factorization of the
            (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor. This also means that the
            solution X, estimated condition numbers, and error bounds could be
            unreliable.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>UPLO</u>

       <b>DLASYF</b> computes a partial factorization of a real symmetric matrix using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal
       pivoting method.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DLASYF computes a partial factorization of a real symmetric matrix A
            using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method. The partial
            factorization has the form:

            A  =  ( I  U12 ) ( A11  0  ) (  I       0    )  if UPLO = 'U', or:
                  ( 0  U22 ) (  0   D  ) ( U12**T U22**T )

            A  =  ( L11  0 ) (  D   0  ) ( L11**T L21**T )  if UPLO = 'L'
                  ( L21  I ) (  0  A22 ) (  0       I    )

            where the order of D is at most NB. The actual order is returned in
            the argument KB, and is either NB or NB-1, or N if N &lt;= NB.

            DLASYF is an auxiliary routine called by DSYTRF. It uses blocked code
            (calling Level 3 BLAS) to update the submatrix A11 (if UPLO = 'U') or
            A22 (if UPLO = 'L').

       <b>DLASYF_AA</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DLATRF_AA factorizes a panel of a real symmetric matrix A using
            the Aasen's algorithm. The panel consists of a set of NB rows of A
            when UPLO is U, or a set of NB columns when UPLO is L.

            In order to factorize the panel, the Aasen's algorithm requires the
            last row, or column, of the previous panel. The first row, or column,
            of A is set to be the first row, or column, of an identity matrix,
            which is used to factorize the first panel.

            The resulting J-th row of U, or J-th column of L, is stored in the
            (J-1)-th row, or column, of A (without the unit diagonals), while
            the diagonal and subdiagonal of A are overwritten by those of T.

                     On entry, A contains the last row, or column, of
                     the previous panel, and the trailing submatrix of A
                     to be factorized, except for the first panel, only

                     diagonal blocks which correspond to 1 or 2 interchanges
                     at each factorization step.

                     If UPLO = 'U',

                       a) A single positive entry IPIV(k) &gt; 0 means:
                          D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

                          interchanged in the submatrix A(1:N,N-KB+1:N);

                          it is used to solve a system of equations.

                          NOTE: INFO only stores the first occurrence of

                          is not stored in INFO even though the factorization
                          always completes.

       <b>DLASYF_ROOK</b> *&gt; DLASYF_ROOK computes a partial factorization of a real symmetric matrix using the bounded
       Bunch-Kaufman ('rook') diagonal pivoting method.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DLASYF_ROOK computes a partial factorization of a real symmetric
            matrix A using the bounded Bunch-Kaufman ("rook") diagonal
            pivoting method. The partial factorization has the form:

            A  =  ( I  U12 ) ( A11  0  ) (  I       0    )  if UPLO = 'U', or:
                  ( 0  U22 ) (  0   D  ) ( U12**T U22**T )

            A  =  ( L11  0 ) (  D   0  ) ( L11**T L21**T )  if UPLO = 'L'
                  ( L21  I ) (  0  A22 ) (  0       I    )

            where the order of D is at most NB. The actual order is returned in
            the argument KB, and is either NB or NB-1, or N if N &lt;= NB.

            DLASYF_ROOK is an auxiliary routine called by DSYTRF_ROOK. It uses
            blocked code (calling Level 3 BLAS) to update the submatrix
            A11 (if UPLO = 'U') or A22 (if UPLO = 'L').

                        If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k)
                        were interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

                        If IPIV(k) &lt; 0 and IPIV(k+1) &lt; 0, then rows and

            DSYCONVF_ROOK converts the factorization output format used in
            DSYTRF_ROOK provided on entry in parameter A into the factorization
            output format used in DSYTRF_RK (or DSYTRF_BK) that is stored

            symmetric matrix A (with respect to the Euclidean norm) and reduce
            its condition number. The scale factors S are computed by the BIN
            algorithm (see references) so that the scaled matrix B with elements
            B(i,j) = S(i)*A(i,j)*S(j) has a condition number within a factor N of
            the smallest possible condition number over all possible diagonal
            scalings.

                     If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)

                     largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
                     the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
                     overestimate of the true error.

       <b>DSYRFSX</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

               DSYRFSX improves the computed solution to a system of linear
               equations when the coefficient matrix is symmetric indefinite, and
               provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the
               solution.  In addition to normwise error bound, the code provides
               maximum componentwise error bound if possible.  See comments for
               ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the error bounds.

               The original system of linear equations may have been equilibrated
               before calling this routine, as described by arguments EQUED and S
               below. In this case, the solution and error bounds returned are
               for the original unequilibrated system.

                Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
                settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
                defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
                can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
                the PARAMS argument.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                  = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
                  = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

           <u>EQUED</u>

                     EQUED is CHARACTER*1
                Specifies the form of equilibration that was done to A
                before calling this routine. This is needed to compute
                the solution and error bounds correctly.
                  = 'N':  No equilibration
                  = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
                          replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
                          The right hand side B has been changed accordingly.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                The order of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>NRHS</u>

                     NRHS is INTEGER
                The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
                of the matrices B and X.  NRHS &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
                The symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
                upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular
                part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular
                part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading
                N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                triangular part of A is not referenced.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>AF</u>

                     AF is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAF,N)
                The factored form of the matrix A.  AF contains the block
                diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to obtain the
                factor U or L from the factorization A = U*D*U**T or A =
                L*D*L**T as computed by DSYTRF.

           <u>LDAF</u>

                     LDAF is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>IPIV</u>

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
                as determined by DSYTRF.

           <u>S</u>

                     S is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
                The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
                the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
                'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
                = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
                element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
                of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
                and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
                rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
                Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
                is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
                that may not be reliable.

           <u>B</u>

                     B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
                The right hand side matrix B.

           <u>LDB</u>

                     LDB is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>X</u>

                     X is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
                On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by DGETRS.
                On exit, the improved solution matrix X.

           <u>LDX</u>

                     LDX is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>RCOND</u>

                     RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
                Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
                reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
                equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
                precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
                to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
                if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
                conditioned.

           <u>BERR</u>

                     BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
                Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
                componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
                (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
                makes X(j) an exact solution).

           <u>N_ERR_BNDS</u>

                     N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
                Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
                and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
                ERR_BNDS_COMP below.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_NORM</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_NORM is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                        max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
                       ------------------------------
                             max_j abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
                below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
                returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
                         radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

                cautions.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_COMP</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_COMP is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                               abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
                        max_j ----------------------
                                    abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
                componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
                information as described below. There currently are up to three
                pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
                componentwise accuracy is not requested (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 0.0), then
                ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS &lt; 3, then at most
                the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
                         current right-hand side and S scales each row of
                         A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
                         sums of Z are approximately 1.

                cautions.

       <b>DSYTF2_RK</b> computes the factorization of a real symmetric indefinite matrix using the bounded Bunch-
       Kaufman (rook) diagonal pivoting method (BLAS2 unblocked algorithm).

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DSYTF2_RK computes the factorization of a real symmetric matrix A
            using the bounded Bunch-Kaufman (rook) diagonal pivoting method:

               A = P*U*D*(U**T)*(P**T) or A = P*L*D*(L**T)*(P**T),

            where U (or L) is unit upper (or lower) triangular matrix,
            U**T (or L**T) is the transpose of U (or L), P is a permutation
            matrix, P**T is the transpose of P, and D is symmetric and block
            diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

            This is the unblocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 2 BLAS.

                          matrix D on the diagonal of A, i.e. D(k,k) = A(k,k);
                          (superdiagonal (or subdiagonal) elements of D

                     the symmetric block diagonal matrix D with 1-by-1 or 2-by-2
                     diagonal blocks which correspond to 1 or 2 interchanges
                     at each factorization step. For more info see Further

                     INFO is INTEGER

                     &lt; 0: If INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value

                     &gt; 0: If INFO = k, the matrix A is singular, because:
                            If UPLO = 'U': column k in the upper
                            triangular part of A contains all zeros.

                            triangular part of A contains all zeros.

                          Therefore D(k,k) is exactly zero, and superdiagonal
                          elements of column k of U (or subdiagonal elements of
                          column k of L ) are all zeros. The factorization has
                          been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
                          exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if
                          it is used to solve a system of equations.

                          NOTE: INFO only stores the first occurrence of
                          a singularity, any subsequent occurrence of singularity
                          is not stored in INFO even though the factorization
                          always completes.

       <b>DSYTF2_ROOK</b> computes the factorization of a real symmetric indefinite matrix using the bounded Bunch-

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DSYTF2_ROOK computes the factorization of a real symmetric matrix A
            using the bounded Bunch-Kaufman ("rook") diagonal pivoting method:

               A = U*D*U**T  or  A = L*D*L**T

            where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
            triangular matrices, U**T is the transpose of U, and D is symmetric and
            block diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

            This is the unblocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 2 BLAS.

                     superdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the orthogonal
                     matrix Q as a product of elementary reflectors; if UPLO
                     = 'L', the diagonal and first subdiagonal of A are over-
                     written by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal

                     E(i) = A(i,i+1) if UPLO = 'U', E(i) = A(i+1,i) if UPLO = 'L'.

                     For optimum performance LWORK &gt;= N*NB, where NB is the
                     optimal blocksize.

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
                     only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
                     this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error

             where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with

             A(1:i-1,i+1), and tau in TAU(i).

       <b>Purpose:</b>

                     A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)

                     = 'L', the diagonal and first subdiagonal of A are over-
                     written by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal

                     j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB
                     as follows:
                     if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)&lt;=i&lt;=j;

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine

                     this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
                     message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

                     algorithm, usually FACTOPTNB=128 is a good choice otherwise
                     putting LWORK=-1 will provide the size of WORK.

         Each H(i) has the form

            H(i) = I - tau * v * v**T

         where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DSYTRF computes the factorization of a real symmetric matrix A using
            the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method.  The form of the
            factorization is

               A = U**T*D*U  or  A = L*D*L**T

            where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
            triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
            1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

            This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.

                     N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
                     leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.

                     On exit, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used

                     Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.
                     If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
                     interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
                     If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) &lt; 0, then rows and
                     columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
                     is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
                     IPIV(k+1) &lt; 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
                     interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

           <u>WORK</u>

                     WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
                     On exit, if INFO = 0, <a href="../man1/WORK.1.html">WORK</a>(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

           <u>LWORK</u>

                     LWORK is INTEGER

                     LWORK &gt;= N*NB, where NB is the block size returned by ILAENV.

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DSYTRF_ROOK computes the factorization of a real symmetric matrix A
            using the bounded Bunch-Kaufman ("rook") diagonal pivoting method.
            The form of the factorization is

               A = U*D*U**T  or  A = L*D*L**T

            where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
            triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
            1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

            This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.

                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the

       <b>DTGSYL</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DTGSYL solves the generalized Sylvester equation:

                        A * R - L * B = scale * C                 (1)
                        D * R - L * E = scale * F

            where R and L are unknown m-by-n matrices, (A, D), (B, E) and
            (C, F) are given matrix pairs of size m-by-m, n-by-n and m-by-n,
            respectively, with real entries. (A, D) and (B, E) must be in
            generalized (real) Schur canonical form, i.e. A, B are upper quasi
            triangular and D, E are upper triangular.

            The solution (R, L) overwrites (C, F). 0 &lt;= SCALE &lt;= 1 is an output
            scaling factor chosen to avoid overflow.

            In matrix notation (1) is equivalent to solve  Zx = scale b, where
            Z is defined as

                       Z = [ kron(In, A)  -kron(B**T, Im) ]         (2)
                           [ kron(In, D)  -kron(E**T, Im) ].

            Here Ik is the identity matrix of size k and X**T is the transpose of
            X. kron(X, Y) is the Kronecker product between the matrices X and Y.

            If TRANS = 'T', DTGSYL solves the transposed system Z**T*y = scale*b,
            which is equivalent to solve for R and L in

                        A**T * R + D**T * L = scale * C           (3)
                        R * B**T + L * E**T = scale * -F

            This case (TRANS = 'T') is used to compute an one-norm-based estimate
            of Dif[(A,D), (B,E)], the separation between the matrix pairs (A,D)
            and (B,E), using DLACON.

            If IJOB &gt;= 1, DTGSYL computes a Frobenius norm-based estimate
            of Dif[(A,D),(B,E)]. That is, the reciprocal of a lower bound on the
            reciprocal of the smallest singular value of Z. See [1-2] for more
            information.

            This is a level 3 BLAS algorithm.

                     Dif[(A,D), (B,E)] = sigma_min(Z), where Z as in (2).
                     IF IJOB = 0 or TRANS = 'T', DIF is not touched.

           <u>SCALE</u>

                     SCALE is DOUBLE PRECISION
                     On exit SCALE is the scaling factor in (1) or (3).
                     If 0 &lt; SCALE &lt; 1, C and F hold the solutions R and L, resp.,
                     to a slightly perturbed system but the input matrices A, B, D
                     and E have not been changed. If SCALE = 0, C and F hold the
                     solutions R and L, respectively, to the homogeneous system
                     with C = F = 0. Normally, SCALE = 1.

           <u>WORK</u>

                     WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
                     On exit, if INFO = 0, <a href="../man1/WORK.1.html">WORK</a>(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

           <u>LWORK</u>

                     LWORK is INTEGER
                     The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK &gt; = 1.
                     If IJOB = 1 or 2 and TRANS = 'N', LWORK &gt;= max(1,2*M*N).

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
                     only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
                     this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
                     message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

           <u>IWORK</u>

                     IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (M+N+6)

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                       =0: successful exit
                       &lt;0: If INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
                       &gt;0: (A, D) and (B, E) have common or close eigenvalues.

       <b>DTRSYL</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DTRSYL solves the real Sylvester matrix equation:

               op(A)*X + X*op(B) = scale*C or
               op(A)*X - X*op(B) = scale*C,

            where op(A) = A or A**T, and  A and B are both upper quasi-
            triangular. A is M-by-M and B is N-by-N; the right hand side C and
            the solution X are M-by-N; and scale is an output scale factor, set
            &lt;= 1 to avoid overflow in X.

            A and B must be in Schur canonical form (as returned by DHSEQR), that
            is, block upper triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks;
            each 2-by-2 diagonal block has its diagonal elements equal and its
            off-diagonal elements of opposite sign.
