</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Biblio::SICI::ItemSegment - The item segment of a SICI

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.04

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $sici = Biblio::SICI-&gt;new();

         $sici-&gt;item-&gt;issn('2232-7651');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Please</u> <u>note:</u> You are expected to not directly instantiate objects of this class!

       The item segment of a SICI describes various aspects of the serial item referenced by the SICI.  Unlike
       the contribution segment, which may be empty, the item segment is required!

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       For each attribute, clearer ("clear_") and predicate ("has_") methods are provided.

       "issn"
           The ISSN of the serial.

       "chronology"
           Identifies  a  specific  date  - usually the cover date - for an item of a serial title.  Follows the
           format "YYYYMMDD" with only the applicable levels being used.  For "MM", in addition to 01 to 12, the
           values 21 to 24 represent seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) and the values 31  to  34  represent
           the four quarters of a year.

       "enumeration"
           Describes,  which  item  of  the serial is referenced.  The most common way of identifying an item is
           using a combination of volume and issue numbers, which is why there are separate attributes for these
           kinds of data.

           Please not that setting a value for "enumeration" means that any  value  present  in  the  attributes
           "volume", "issue" or "supplOrIdx" gets removed!

       "volume"
           The volume designation of the serial item.

           Please note that setting a value for this attribute automatically clears the "enumeration" attribute.

       "issue"
           The issue designation of the serial item.

           Please note that setting a value for this attribute automatically clears the "enumeration" attribute.

       "supplOrIdx"
           A  one  character  code  to  describe if the SICI refers to either a supplement of the described item
           (represented as '+') or to an index (represented as '*') which  is  published  independently  from  a
           regular item.

           (If  you  wish  to  refer to an index within an item please have a look at the "dpi" attribute of the
           control segment!)

           Please note that setting a value for this attribute automatically clears the "enumeration" attribute.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       LIST "year"()
           Extracts the year info from the "chronology" attribute.  Returns "undef" if no  chronology  has  been
           set.  May return either one or two values, depending on the given chronology.  E.g.:

           •   if  the  chronology  value  is  <b>199624/199721</b>  (an item published Winter 1996 / Spring 1997) this
               method will return "(1996, 1997)"

           •   if the chronology value is <b>20021201</b> (item published on Dec. 1st, 2002) this  method  will  return
               "(2002)"

       LIST "month"()
           Extracts the month(s) from the chronology.  Returns "undef" if no chronology has been set or no month
           info  is  available from the chronology.  May return either one or two values, depending on the given
           chronology. Each value may be in the ranges 01 to 12, or 21 to 24, or 31 to 34; with 21 to  24  being
           the  codes for the seasons Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter and 31 to 34 being the codes for the four
           quarters of a year  (cf. the info on the "chronology" attribute).  E.g.:

           •   if the chronology value is <b>199911/12</b> (an item published November /  December  1999)  this  method
               will return "(11, 12)"

           •   if  the  chronology  value is <b>20021201</b> (item published on Dec. 1st, 2002) this method will return
               "(12)"

           •   if the chronology value is <b>200721/22</b> (an item published Spring / Summer 2007)  this  method  will
               return "(21, 22)"

       LIST "day"()
           Extracts  the  days(s)  from the chronology.  Returns "undef" if no chronology has been set or no day
           info is available from the chronology.  May return either one or two values, depending on  the  given
           chronology.  E.g.:

           •   if  the chronology value is <b>19991101/02</b> (an item published November 1st / November 2nd 1999) this
               method will return "(01, 02)" (note the leading zeroes!); day spans are quite unlikely,  but  not
               prohibited

           •   if  the  chronology  value is <b>20021201</b> (item published on Dec. 1st, 2002) this method will return
               "(01)"

       STRING "to_string"()
           Returns a stringified representation of the data in the item segment.

       "reset"()
           Resets all attributes to their default values.

       BOOL "is_valid"()
           Checks if the data for the control segment conforms to the standard.
