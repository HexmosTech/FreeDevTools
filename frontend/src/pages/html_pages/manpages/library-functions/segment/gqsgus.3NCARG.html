</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       GQSGUS (Inquire set of segment names in use) - Retrieves what segment names are currently in use.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL GQSGUS(N,ERRIND,OL,SGNA)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/gks.h&gt;

       void  ginq_set_seg_names(Gint  num_elems_appl_list,  Gint start_pos, Gint *err_ind, Gint_list *seg_names,
       Gint *length_list);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       N           (Integer, Input) - The set member requested.

       ERRIND      (Integer, Output) - If the GKS state is WSOP (workstation open), WSAC  (workstation  active),
                   or SGOP (segment open), then ERRIND is returned as "0"; otherwise ERRIND is returned as "7".

       OL          (Integer, Output) - The number of segment names that are currently in use.

       SGNA        (Integer,  Output)  - If the GKS state is WSOP (workstation open), WSAC (workstation active),
                   or SGOP (segment open), and if OL is larger than zero, then SGNA is returned as the  name  in
                   the  Nth  element  of  the list of segment names that are currently in use; otherwise SGNA is
                   undefined.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       For NCAR GKS, segment names are integers between 0 and 99 inclusive (see the man page for GCRSG).

       If one wants to obtain a list of all segment names that are currently in use, then the procedure  usually
       is  first  to determines the number of segment names currently in use by making an initial call to GQSGUS
       with first argument of "1".  If ERRIND is returned as "0", then OL will tell you how  many  segments  are
       currently  in use.  Then, to get the list of all segment names currently in use, call GQSGUS in a loop on
       N from 1 to OL and retrieve the N values of SGNA returned from such calls.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use GKS routines, load the NCAR GKS-0A library ncarg_gks.
