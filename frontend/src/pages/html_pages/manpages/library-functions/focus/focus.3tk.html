       focus - Manage the input focus

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>focus</b>
       <b>focus</b> <u>window</u>
       <b>focus</b> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>focus</b> command is used to manage the Tk input focus.  At any given time, one window on each display is
       designated  as  the  <u>focus</u>  <u>window</u>;  any key press or key release events for the display are sent to that
       window.  It is normally up to the window manager to redirect the focus among the top-level windows  of  a
       display.   For  example,  some  window  managers  automatically set the input focus to a top-level window
       whenever the mouse enters it;  others redirect the input focus only when the user  clicks  on  a  window.
       Usually the window manager will set the focus only to top-level windows, leaving it up to the application
       to redirect the focus among the children of the top-level.

       Tk remembers one focus window for each top-level (the most recent descendant of that top-level to receive
       the focus);  when the window manager gives the focus to a top-level, Tk automatically redirects it to the
       remembered  window.   Within  a  top-level  Tk uses an <u>explicit</u> focus model by default.  Moving the mouse
       within a top-level does not normally change the focus;  the focus changes  only  when  a  widget  decides
       explicitly to claim the focus (e.g., because of a button click), or when the user types a key such as Tab
       that moves the focus.

       The Tcl procedure <b>tk_focusFollowsMouse</b> may be invoked to create an <u>implicit</u> focus model:  it reconfigures
       Tk  so  that  the focus is set to a window whenever the mouse enters it.  The Tcl procedures <b>tk_focusNext</b>
       and <b>tk_focusPrev</b> implement a focus order among the windows of a top-level;  they are used in the  default
       bindings for Tab and Shift-Tab, among other things.

       The <b>focus</b> command can take any of the following forms:

       <b>focus</b>  Returns the path name of the focus window on the display containing the application's main window,
              or  an empty string if no window in this application has the focus on that display.   Note:  it is
              better to specify the display explicitly using <b>-displayof</b> (see below) so that the code  will  work
              in applications using multiple displays.

       <b>focus</b> <u>window</u>
              If  the  application  currently  has  the input focus on <u>window</u>'s display, this command resets the
              input focus for <u>window</u>'s display to <u>window</u> and returns an empty string.  If the  application  does
              not currently have the input focus on <u>window</u>'s display, <u>window</u> will be remembered as the focus for
              its  top-level;   the next time the focus arrives at the top-level, Tk will redirect it to <u>window</u>.
              If <u>window</u> is an empty string then the command does nothing.

       <b>focus</b> <b>-displayof</b> <u>window</u>
              Returns the name of the focus window on the display containing <u>window</u>.  If the  focus  window  for
              <u>window</u>'s display is not in this application, the return value is an empty string.

       <b>focus</b> <b>-force</b> <u>window</u>
              Sets  the focus of <u>window</u>'s display to <u>window</u>, even if the application does not currently have the
              input focus for the display.  This command should be used sparingly, if at all.  In normal  usage,
              an  application  should  not  claim  the focus for itself;  instead, it should wait for the window
              manager to give it the focus.  If <u>window</u> is an empty string then the command does nothing.

       <b>focus</b> <b>-lastfor</b> <u>window</u>
              Returns the name of the most recent window to have the input focus among all the  windows  in  the
              same  top-level as <u>window</u>.  If no window in that top-level has ever had the input focus, or if the
              most recent focus window has been deleted, then the name of the top-level is returned.  The return
              value is the window that will receive the input focus the next time the window manager  gives  the
              focus to the top-level.

</pre><h4><b>QUIRKS</b></h4><pre>
       When  an  internal  window receives the input focus, Tk does not actually set the X focus to that window;
       as far as X is concerned, the focus will stay on the top-level window  containing  the  window  with  the
       focus.   However,  Tk  generates  FocusIn and FocusOut events just as if the X focus were on the internal
       window.   This approach gets around a number of problems that would occur if the X  focus  were  actually
       moved;  the  fact  that the X focus is on the top-level is invisible unless you use C code to query the X
       server directly.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       To make a window that only participates in the focus traversal ring when  a  variable  is  set,  add  the
       following bindings to the widgets <u>before</u> and <u>after</u> it in that focus ring:

              button .before -text "Before"
              button .middle -text "Middle"
              button .after  -text "After"
              checkbutton .flag -variable traverseToMiddle -takefocus 0
              pack .flag -side left
              pack .before .middle .after
              bind .before &lt;Tab&gt; {
                 if {!$traverseToMiddle} {
                    <b>focus</b> .after
                    break
                 }
              }
              bind .after &lt;Shift-Tab&gt; {
                 if {!$traverseToMiddle} {
                    <b>focus</b> .before
                    break
                 }
              }
              <b>focus</b> .before
