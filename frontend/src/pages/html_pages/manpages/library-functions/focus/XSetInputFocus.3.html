</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XSetInputFocus, XGetInputFocus - control input focus

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>

       int XSetInputFocus(Display *<u>display</u>, Window <u>focus</u>, int <u>revert_to</u>, Time <u>time</u>);

       int XGetInputFocus(Display *<u>display</u>, Window *<u>focus_return</u>, int *<u>revert_to_return</u>);

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>display</u>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <u>focus</u>     Specifies the window, <b>PointerRoot</b>, or <b>None</b>.

       <u>focus_return</u>
                 Returns the focus window, <b>PointerRoot</b>, or <b>None</b>.

       <u>revert_to</u> Specifies  where  the  input focus reverts to if the window becomes not viewable.  You can pass
                 <b>RevertToParent</b>, <b>RevertToPointerRoot</b>, or <b>RevertToNone</b>.

       <u>revert_to_return</u>
                 Returns the current focus state (<b>RevertToParent</b>, <b>RevertToPointerRoot</b>, or <b>RevertToNone</b>).

       <u>time</u>      Specifies the time.  You can pass either a timestamp or <b>CurrentTime</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>XSetInputFocus</b> function changes the input focus and the last-focus-change time.  It has no effect  if
       the  specified  time  is  earlier  than the current last-focus-change time or is later than the current X
       server time.  Otherwise, the last-focus-change time is set to the specified time (<b>CurrentTime</b> is replaced
       by the current X server time).  <b>XSetInputFocus</b> causes the X  server  to  generate  <b>FocusIn</b>  and  <b>FocusOut</b>
       events.

       Depending on the focus argument, the following occurs:

       •    If  focus  is  <b>None</b>,  all  keyboard  events  are  discarded until a new focus window is set, and the
            revert_to argument is ignored.

       •    If focus is a window, it becomes the keyboard's focus window.  If a generated keyboard  event  would
            normally  be  reported  to  this  window  or  one  of its inferiors, the event is reported as usual.
            Otherwise, the event is reported relative to the focus window.

       •    If focus is <b>PointerRoot</b>, the focus window is dynamically taken to be the  root  window  of  whatever
            screen the pointer is on at each keyboard event.  In this case, the revert_to argument is ignored.

       The  specified  focus  window  must be viewable at the time <b>XSetInputFocus</b> is called, or a <b>BadMatch</b> error
       results.  If the focus window later becomes not viewable, the X server evaluates the  revert_to  argument
       to determine the new focus window as follows:

       •    If  revert_to is <b>RevertToParent</b>, the focus reverts to the parent (or the closest viewable ancestor),
            and the new revert_to value is taken to be <b>RevertToNone</b>.

       •    If revert_to is <b>RevertToPointerRoot</b> or <b>RevertToNone</b>, the  focus  reverts  to  <b>PointerRoot</b>  or  <b>None</b>,
            respectively.   When  the focus reverts, the X server generates <b>FocusIn</b> and <b>FocusOut</b> events, but the
            last-focus-change time is not affected.

       <b>XSetInputFocus</b> can generate <b>BadMatch</b>, <b>BadValue</b>, and <b>BadWindow</b> errors.

       The <b>XGetInputFocus</b> function returns the focus window and the current focus state.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BadValue</b>  Some numeric value falls outside the range  of  values  accepted  by  the  request.   Unless  a
                 specific  range  is specified for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

       <b>BadWindow</b> A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
