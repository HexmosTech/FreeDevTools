       wxFocusEvent - Functions for wxFocusEvent class

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  focus  event  is  sent  when a window's focus changes. The window losing focus receives a "kill focus"
       event while the window gaining it gets a "set focus" one.

       Notice that the set focus event happens both when the user gives focus to the window (whether  using  the
       mouse or keyboard) and when it is done from the program itself using <u>wxWindow:setFocus/1</u>.

       The  focus  event  handlers should almost invariably call <u>wxEvent:skip/2</u> on their event argument to allow
       the default handling to take place. Failure to do this may result in incorrect behaviour  of  the  native
       controls.  Also  note  that wxEVT_KILL_FOCUS handler must not call <u>wxWindow:setFocus/1</u> as this, again, is
       not supported by all native controls. If you need to do this, consider using the <u>Delayed</u> <u>Action</u> <u>Mechanism</u>
       (not implemented in wx) described in <u>wxIdleEvent</u> documentation.

       See: Overview events

       This class is derived (and can use functions) from: <u>wxEvent</u>

       wxWidgets docs: wxFocusEvent

</pre><h4><b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Use <u>wxEvtHandler:connect/3</u> with <u>wxFocusEventType</u> to subscribe to events of this type.

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wxFocusEvent()</b> = wx:wx_object()

       <b>wxFocus()</b> =
           #wxFocus{type = wxFocusEvent:wxFocusEventType(),
                    win = wxWindow:wxWindow()}

       <b>wxFocusEventType()</b> = set_focus | kill_focus

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>getWindow(This)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>wxWindow:wxWindow()</b>

              Types:

                 This = wxFocusEvent()

              Returns the window associated with this event, that is the window which had the focus  before  for
              the  <u>wxEVT_SET_FOCUS</u> event and the window which is going to receive focus for the <u>wxEVT_KILL_FOCUS</u>
              one.

              Warning: the window pointer may be NULL!
