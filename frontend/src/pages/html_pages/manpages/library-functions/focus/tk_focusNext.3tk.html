       tk_focusNext, tk_focusPrev, tk_focusFollowsMouse - Utility procedures for managing the input focus.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tk_focusNext</b> <u>window</u>
       <b>tk_focusPrev</b> <u>window</u>
       <b>tk_focusFollowsMouse</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tk_focusNext</b>  is  a  utility  procedure  used for keyboard traversal.  It returns the “next” window after
       <u>window</u> in focus order. The focus order is determined by the stacking order of windows and  the  structure
       of  the  window  hierarchy.   Among siblings, the focus order is the same as the stacking order, with the
       lowest window being first.  If a window has children, the  window  is  visited  first,  followed  by  its
       children  (recursively),  followed by its next sibling.  Top-level windows other than <u>window</u> are skipped,
       so that <b>tk_focusNext</b> never returns a window in a different top-level from <u>window</u>.

       After computing the next window, <b>tk_focusNext</b> examines the window's <b>-takefocus</b> option to see  whether  it
       should  be  skipped.   If  so,  <b>tk_focusNext</b> continues on to the next window in the focus order, until it
       eventually finds a window that will accept the focus or returns back to <u>window</u>.

       <b>tk_focusPrev</b> is similar to <b>tk_focusNext</b> except that it returns the window just before <u>window</u> in the focus
       order.

       <b>tk_focusFollowsMouse</b> changes the focus model for the application to an  implicit  one  where  the  window
       under  the  mouse  gets the focus.  After this procedure is called, whenever the mouse enters a window Tk
       will automatically give it the input focus.  The <b>focus</b> command may be used to move the focus to a  window
       other  than the one under the mouse, but as soon as the mouse moves into a new window the focus will jump
       to that window.

       Note that at present there is no built-in support for returning the  application  to  an  explicit  focus
       model;    to   do  this  you  will  have  to  write  a  script  that  deletes  the  bindings  created  by
       <b>tk_focusFollowsMouse</b>.
