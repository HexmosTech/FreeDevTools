</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>tcl::chan::facade</b>  package provides a command creating facades to other channels. These are channels
       which own a single subordinate channel and delegate all operations to.

       The main use for facades is the debugging of actions on a channel. While most of the information could be
       tracked by a virtual channel transformation it does not have access to the event-related  operation,  and
       furthermore they are only available in Tcl 8.6.

       Therefore this channel, usable with Tcl 8.5, and having access to everything going on for a channel.

       The intercepted actions on channel are logged through package <b>logger</b>.

       Beyond that facades provide the following additional channel configuration options:

       <b>-self</b>  The TclOO object handling the facade.

       <b>-fd</b>    The handle of the subordinate, i.e. wrapped channel.

       <b>-used</b>  The  last  time  the  wrapped  channel  was  read  from  or written to by the facade, as per <b>clock</b>
              <b>milliseconds</b>. A value of <b>0</b> indicates that the subordinate channel was not accessed at all, yet.

       <b>-created</b>
              The time the facade was created, as per <b>clock</b> <b>milliseconds</b>.

       <b>-user</b>  A free-form value identifying the user of the facade and its wrapped channel.

       Of these only option <b>-user</b> is writable.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       <b>::tcl::chan::facade</b> <u>chan</u>
              This command creates the facade channel around the provided channel <u>chan</u>, and returns its handle.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS,</b> <b>IDEAS,</b> <b>FEEDBACK</b></h4><pre>
