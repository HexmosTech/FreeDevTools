</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Jira &lt;<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/</a>&gt; is a proprietary bug tracking system from Atlassian.

       This module implements a very thin wrapper around Jira's REST APIs:

       •   Jira Core REST API &lt;https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/latest/&gt;

           This rich API superseded the old Jira SOAP API &lt;<a href="http://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/rpc">http://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/rpc</a>-
           jira-plugin/latest/com/atlassian/jira/rpc/soap/JiraSoapService.html&gt; which isn't supported anymore as
           of Jira version 7.

           The endpoints of this API have a path prefix of "/rest/api/VERSION".

       •   Jira Service Desk REST API &lt;https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-servicedesk/REST/server/&gt;

           This  API  deals  with  the  objects  of the Jira Service Desk application. Its endpoints have a path
           prefix of "/rest/servicedeskapi".

       •   Jira Software REST API &lt;https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-software/REST/server/&gt;

           This API deals with the objects of the Jira Software application. Its endpoints have a path prefix of
           "/rest/agile/VERSION".

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTORS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b> <b>HASHREF</b>
   <b>new</b> <b>URL,</b> <b>USERNAME,</b> <b>PASSWORD,</b> <b>REST_CLIENT_CONFIG,</b> <b>PROXY,</b> <b>SSL_VERIFY_NONE,</b> <b>ANONYMOUS,</b> <b>PAT,</b> <b>SESSION</b>
       The default constructor can take its arguments from a single hash reference or from a list of  positional
       parameters.  The  first  form  is  preferred because it lets you specify only the arguments you need. The
       second form forces you to pass undefined values if you need to pass  a  specific  value  to  an  argument
       further to the right.

       The arguments are described below with the names which must be used as the hash keys:

       •   <b>url</b>

           A string or a URI object denoting the base URL of the Jira server. This is a required argument.

           The  REST  methods described below all accept as a first argument the endpoint's path of the specific
           API method to call. In general you can pass the complete path, beginning with the prefix denoting the
           particular  API  to  use  ("/rest/api/VERSION",  "/rest/servicedeskapi",  or  "/rest/agile/VERSION").
           However, you may specify a default API prefix by suffixing the URL with it. For example:

               my $jira = JIRA::REST-&gt;new({
                   url      =&gt; 'https://jira.example.net/jira/rest/api/1',
                   username =&gt; 'myuser',
                   password =&gt; 'mypass'
               });

               $jira-&gt;GET('/rest/api/1/issue/TST-1');
               $jira-&gt;GET('/issue/TST-1');

           With  this constructor call both GET methods are the same, because the second one does not specify an
           API prefix. This is useful if you mainly want to use a particular API or if you  want  to  specify  a
           particular version of an API during construction.

       •   <b>username</b>

       •   <b>password</b>

           The username and password of a Jira user to use for authentication.

           If <b>anonymous</b> is false and no <b>pat</b> given, then, if either <b>username</b> or <b>password</b> isn't defined the module
           looks  them  up  in  either  the  ".netrc" file or via Config::Identity (which allows "gpg" encrypted
           credentials).

           Config::Identity will look for <u><a href="file:~/.jira-identity">~/.jira-identity</a></u> or <u><a href="file:~/.jira">~/.jira</a></u>.  You can change the  filename  stub  from
           "jira" to a custom stub with the "JIRA_REST_IDENTITY" environment variable.

       •   <b>rest_client_config</b>

           A  JIRA::REST  object uses a REST::Client object to make the REST invocations. This optional argument
           must be a hash reference that can be fed  to  the  REST::Client  constructor.  Note  that  the  "url"
           argument overwrites any value associated with the "host" key in this hash.

           As  an  extension,  the  hash  reference also accepts one additional argument called <b>proxy</b> that is an
           extension to the REST::Client configuration and will be removed from the hash before passing it on to
           the REST::Client constructor. However, this argument is deprecated since v0.017 and you should  avoid
           it. Use the following argument instead.

       •   <b>proxy</b>

           To  use  a network proxy set this argument to the string or URI object describing the fully qualified
           URL (including port) to your network proxy.

       •   <b>ssl_verify_none</b>

           Sets the "SSL_verify_mode" and "verify_hostname ssl" options on the  underlying  REST::Client's  user
           agent  to  0,  thus  disabling  them.  This  allows  access  to  Jira  servers  that have self-signed
           certificates that don't pass LWP::UserAgent's verification methods.

       •   <b>anonymous</b>

       •   <b>pat</b>

       •   <b>session</b>

           These three arguments are mutually exclusive, i.e., you can use at most one of them. By default, they
           are all undefined.

           The boolean <b>anonymous</b> argument tells the module if you want to connect to the specified Jira with  no
           authentication. This allows you to get some information from open or public Jira servers. If enabled,
           the <b>username</b> and <b>password</b> arguments are disregarded.

           The  <b>pat</b>  argument  maps  to  a  string  which should be a personal access token that can be used for
           authentication instead of a username and a password.  This option is  available  since  Jira  version
           8.14.                             Please                           refer                           to
           &lt;https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html&gt;        for
           details. If enabled, the <b>username</b> and <b>password</b> arguments are disregarded.

           The  booleal <b>session</b> argument tells the module if you want it to acquire a session cookie by making a
           "POST /rest/auth/1/session" call to login to Jira. This is particularly useful when interacting  with
           Jira  Data  Center,  because  it  can  use  the  session  cookie to maintain affinity with one of the
           redundant servers. Upon destruction, the object makes a "DELETE /rest/auth/1/session" call to  logout
           from Jira. If enabled, the <b>username</b> and <b>password</b> arguments are required.

   <b>new_session</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       This alternative constructor simply invokes the default constructor with the same options, adding to them
       the  <b>session</b>  option.  New  code  should use the default constructor with the <b>session</b> option because this
       constructor may be deprecated in the future.

</pre><h4><b>REST</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Jira's REST API documentation lists dozens of "resources" which can be operated  via  the  standard  HTTP
       requests:  GET, DELETE, PUT, and POST. JIRA::REST objects implement four methods called GET, DELETE, PUT,
       and POST to make it easier to invoke and get results from Jira's REST endpoints.

       All four methods need two arguments:

       •   RESOURCE

           This is the resource's 'path'. For example, in order  to  GET  the  list  of  all  fields,  you  pass
           "/rest/api/latest/field",   and   in   order   to  get  SLA  information  about  an  issue  you  pass
           "/rest/servicedeskapi/request/$key/sla".

           If you're using a method from Jira Core REST API you may omit  the  prefix  "/rest/api/VERSION".  For
           example, to GET the list of all fields you may pass just "/field".

           This argument is required.

       •   QUERY

           Some  resource  methods  require or admit parameters which are passed as a "query-string" appended to
           the resource's path. You may construct the query string  and  append  it  to  the  RESOURCE  argument
           yourself,  but  it's  easier  and safer to pass the arguments in a hash. This way the query string is
           constructed     for     you      and      its      values      are      properly      percent-encoded
           &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding</a>&gt; to avoid errors.

           This  argument  is  optional  for  GET  and  DELETE. For PUT and POST it must be passed explicitly as
           "undef" if not needed.

       The PUT and POST methods accept two more arguments:

       •   VALUE

           This is the "entity" being PUT or POSTed. It can be any value, but usually is a hash  reference.  The
           value  is  encoded  as  a JSON &lt;<a href="http://www.json.org/">http://www.json.org/</a>&gt; string using the "JSON::encode" method and sent
           with a Content-Type of "application/json".

           It's usually easy to infer from the Jira REST API documentation which kind of value you  should  pass
           to each resource.

           This argument is required.

       •   HEADERS

           This optional argument allows you to specify extra HTTP headers that should be sent with the request.
           Each header is specified as a key/value pair in a hash.

       All  four  methods  return  the  value  returned by the associated resource's method, as specified in the
       documentation, decoded according to its content type as follows:

       •   application/json

           The majority of the API's resources return JSON values. Those are decoded using the  "decode"  method
           of a "JSON" object. Most of the endpoints return hashes, which are returned as a Perl hash reference.

       •   text/plain

           Those values are returned as simple strings.

       Some  endpoints  don't  return anything. In those cases, the methods return "undef". The methods croak if
       they get any other type of values in return.

       In case of errors (i.e., if the underlying HTTP method return an  error  code  different  from  2xx)  the
       methods croak with a multi-line string like this:

           ERROR: &lt;CODE&gt; - &lt;MESSAGE&gt;
           &lt;CONTENT-TYPE&gt;
           &lt;CONTENT&gt;

       So,  in  order  to  treat errors you must invoke the methods in an eval block or use any of the exception
       handling Perl modules, such as "Try::Tiny" and "Try::Catch".

   <b>GET</b> <b>RESOURCE</b> <b>[,</b> <b>QUERY]</b>
       Returns the RESOURCE as a Perl data structure.

   <b>DELETE</b> <b>RESOURCE</b> <b>[,</b> <b>QUERY]</b>
       Deletes the RESOURCE.

   <b>PUT</b> <b>RESOURCE,</b> <b>QUERY,</b> <b>VALUE</b> <b>[,</b> <b>HEADERS]</b>
       Creates RESOURCE based on VALUE.

   <b>POST</b> <b>RESOURCE,</b> <b>QUERY,</b> <b>VALUE</b> <b>[,</b> <b>HEADERS]</b>
       Updates RESOURCE based on VALUE.

</pre><h4><b>UTILITY</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a few utility methods.

   <b>rest_client</b>
       Returns the REST::Client object used to interact with Jira. It may be useful  when  the  Jira  API  isn't
       enough and you have to go deeper.

   <b>set_search_iterator</b> <b>PARAMS</b>
       Sets  up  an  iterator  for  the search specified by the hash reference PARAMS.  It must be called before
       calls to <b>next_issue</b>.

       PARAMS must conform with the query parameters allowed for the "/rest/api/2/search" Jira REST endpoint.

   <b>next_issue</b>
       This must be called after a call to <b>set_search_iterator</b>. Each call returns a reference to the next  issue
       from the filter. When there are no more issues it returns undef.

       Using  the  set_search_iterator/next_issue  utility  methods you can iterate through large sets of issues
       without worrying about the  startAt/total/offset  attributes  in  the  response  from  the  /search  REST
       endpoint. These methods implement the "paging" algorithm needed to work with those attributes.

   <b>attach_files</b> <b>ISSUE</b> <b>FILE...</b>
       The  "/issue/KEY/attachments"  REST endpoint, used to attach files to issues, requires a specific content
       type encoding which is difficult to come up with just the "REST::Client" interface. This  utility  method
       offers an easier interface to attach files to issues.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>AND</b> <b>JIRA</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>POLICY</b></h4><pre>
       Currently JIRA::REST requires Perl 5.16 and is tested on Jira Data Center 8.13.

       We   try   to   be   compatible   with   the   Perl   native   packages   of   the   oldest   Ubuntu  LTS
       &lt;https://www.ubuntu.com/info/release-end-of-life&gt;  and   CentOS   &lt;https://wiki.centos.org/About/Product&gt;
       Linux distributions still getting maintainance updates.

         +-------------+-----------------------+------+
         | End of Life | Distro                | Perl |
         +-------------+-----------------------+------+
         |   2023-04   | Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic) | 5.26 |
         |   2024-07   | CentOS 7              | 5.16 |
         |   2025-04   | Ubuntu 20.04 (focal)  | 5.30 |
         |   2027-04   | Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy)  | 5.34 |
         |   2029-05   | CentOS 8              | 5.26 |
         +-------------+-----------------------+------+

       As you can see, we're kept behind mostly by the slow pace of CentOS (actually, RHEL) releases.

       As  for Jira, the policy is very lax. I (the author) only test JIRA::REST on the Jira server installed in
       the company I work for, which is usually (but not always) at most one year older than the newest released
       version. I don't have yet an easy way to test it on different versions.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       •   "REST::Client"

           JIRA::REST uses a REST::Client object to perform the low-level interactions.

       •   "JIRA::REST::OAuth"

           This module Sub Classes JIRA::REST providing OAuth 1.0 support.

       •   "JIRA::Client::REST"

           This     is     another     module     implementing     Jira's     REST     API      using      SPORE
           &lt;https://github.com/SPORE/specifications/blob/master/spore_description.pod&gt;.   I  got  a message from
           the author saying that he doesn't intend to keep it going.
