           with 64bit ints but 32bit pointers. Ticket #32309.
         Fixed the selectall_arrayref, selectrow_arrayref, and selectrow_array
           methods that get embedded into compiled drivers to use the
           inner sth handle when passed a $sth instead of an sql string.
           Drivers will need to be recompiled to pick up this change.
         Fixed leak in neat() for some kinds of values thanks to Rudolf Lippan.
         Fixed DBI::PurePerl neat() to behave more like XS neat().

         Increased default $DBI::neat_maxlen from 400 to 1000.

         Changed behaviour of trace levels 1..4 to show less information
           at lower levels.
         Changed the format of the key used for $h-&gt;{CachedKids}
           (which is undocumented so you shouldn't depend on it anyway)
         Changed gofer error handling to avoid duplicate error text in errstr.
         Clarified docs re ":N" style placeholders.
         Improved gofer retry-on-error logic and refactored to aid subclassing.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.57</b> <b>(svn</b> <b>rev</b> <b>9639)</b> <b>-</b> <b>13</b> <b>Jun</b> <b>2007</b>
         Note: this release includes a change to the DBI::hash() function which will
         now produce different values than before *if* your perl was built with 64-bit
         'int' type (i.e. "perl -V:intsize" says intsize='8').  It's relatively rare
         for perl to be configured that way, even on 64-bit systems.

         Fixed XS versions of select*_*() methods to call execute()
           fetch() etc., with inner handle instead of outer.
         Fixed execute_for_fetch() to not cache errstr values
           thanks to Bart Degryse.
         Fixed unused var compiler warning thanks to JDHEDDEN.
         Fixed t/86gofer_fail tests to be less likely to fail falsely.

         Changed DBI::hash to return 'I32' type instead of 'int' so results are
           portable/consistent regardless of size of the int type.
         Corrected timeout example in docs thanks to Egmont Koblinger.
         Changed t/01basic.t to warn instead of failing when it detects
           a problem with Math::BigInt (some recent versions had problems).

         Added support for !Time and !Time~N to DBI::Profile Path. See docs.
         Added extra trace info to connect_cached thanks to Walery Studennikov.
         Added non-random (deterministic) mode to DBI_GOFER_RANDOM mechanism.
         Added DBIXS_REVISION macro that drivers can use.
         Added more docs for private_attribute_info() method.

         DBI::Profile changes:
           dbi_profile() now returns ref to relevant leaf node.
           Don't profile DESTROY during global destruction.
           Added as_node_path_list() and as_text() methods.
         DBI::ProfileDumper changes:
           Don't write file if there's no profile data.
           Uses full natural precision when saving data (was using %.6f)
           Optimized flush_to_disk().
           Locks the data file while writing.
           Enabled filename to be a code ref for dynamic names.
         DBI::ProfileDumper::Apache changes:
           Added Quiet=&gt;1 to avoid write to STDERR in flush_to_disk().
           Added Dir=&gt;... to specify a writable destination directory.
           Enabled DBI_PROFILE_APACHE_LOG_DIR for mod_perl 1 as well as 2.
           Added parent pid to default data file name.
         DBI::ProfileData changes:
           Added DeleteFiles option to rename &amp; delete files once read.
           Locks the data files while reading.
           Added ability to sort by Path elements.
         dbiprof changes:
           Added --dumpnodes and --delete options.
         Added/updated docs for both DBI::ProfileDumper &amp;&amp; ::Apache.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.56</b> <b>(svn</b> <b>rev</b> <b>9660)</b> <b>-</b> <b>18</b> <b>Jun</b> <b>2007</b>
         Fixed printf arg warnings thanks to JDHEDDEN.
         Fixed returning driver-private sth attributes via gofer.

         Changed pod docs docs to use =head3 instead of =item
           so now in html you get links to individual methods etc.
         Changed default gofer retry_limit from 2 to 0.
         Changed tests to workaround Math::BigInt broken versions.
         Changed dbi_profile_merge() to dbi_profile_merge_nodes()
           old name still works as an alias for the new one.
         Removed old DBI internal sanity check that's no longer valid
           causing "panic: DESTROY (dbih_clearcom)" when tracing enabled

         Added DBI_GOFER_RANDOM env var that can be use to trigger random
           failures and delays when executing gofer requests. Designed to help
           test automatic retry on failures and timeout handling.
         Added lots more docs to all the DBD::Gofer and DBI::Gofer classes.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.55</b> <b>(svn</b> <b>rev</b> <b>9504)</b> <b>-</b> <b>04</b> <b>May</b> <b>2007</b>

         Fixed accuracy of profiling when perl configured to use long doubles.
         Fixed 42prof_data.t on fast systems with poor timers thanks to Malcolm Nooning.
         Fixed potential corruption in selectall_arrayref and selectrow_arrayref
           for compiled drivers, thanks to Rob Davies.
           Rebuild your compiled drivers after installing DBI.

         Changed some handle creation code from perl to C code,
           to reduce handle creation cost by ~20%.
         Changed internal implementation of the CachedKids attribute
           so it's a normal handle attribute (and initially undef).
         Changed connect_cached and prepare_cached to avoid a FETCH method call,
           and thereby reduced cost by ~5% and ~30% respectively.
         Changed _set_fbav to not croak when given a wrongly sized array,
           it now warns and adjusts the row buffer to match.
         Changed some internals to improve performance with threaded perls.
         Changed DBD::NullP to be slightly more useful for testing.

         Added more functionality to the (undocumented) Callback mechanism.
           Callbacks can now elect to provide a value to be returned, in which case
           the method won't be called. A callback for "*" is applied to all methods
           that don't have their own callback.
         Added $h-&gt;{ReadOnly} attribute.
         Added support for DBI Profile Path to contain refs to scalars
           which will be de-ref'd for each profile sample.
         Added dbilogstrip utility to edit DBI logs for diff'ing (gets installed)
         Added details for SQLite 3.3 to NULL handling docs thanks to Alex Teslik.
         Added take_imp_data() to DBI::PurePerl.

         Gofer related changes:
           Fixed gofer pipeone &amp; stream transports to avoid risk of hanging.
           Improved error handling and tracing significantly.
           Added way to generate random 1-in-N failures for methods.
           Added automatic retry-on-error mechanism to gofer transport base class.
           Added tests to show automatic retry mechanism works a treat!
           Added go_retry_hook callback hook so apps can fine-tune retry behaviour.
           Added header to request and response packets for sanity checking
             and to enable version skew between client and server.
           Added forced_single_resultset, max_cached_sth_per_dbh and max_cached_dbh_per_drh
             to gofer executor config.
           Driver-private methods installed with install_method are now proxied.
           No longer does a round-trip to the server for methods it knows
             have not been overridden by the remote driver.
           Most significant aspects of gofer behaviour are controlled by policy mechanism.
           Added policy-controlled caching of results for some methods, such as schema metadata.
           The connect_cached and prepare_cached methods cache on client and server.
           The bind_param_array and execute_array methods are now supported.
           Worked around a DBD::Sybase bind_param bug (which is fixed in DBD::Sybase 1.07)
           Added goferperf.pl utility (doesn't get installed).
           Many other assorted Gofer related bug fixes, enhancements and docs.
           The http and mod_perl transports have been remove to their own distribution.
           Client and server will need upgrading together for this release.

         Fixed assorted attribute handling bugs in DBD::Proxy.
         Fixed croak() in DBD::NullP thanks to Sergey Skvortsov.
         Fixed handling of take_imp_data() and dbi_imp_data attribute.
         Fixed bugs in DBD::DBM thanks to Jeff Zucker.
         Fixed bug in DBI::ProfileDumper thanks to Sam Tregar.
         Fixed ping in DBD::Proxy thanks to George Campbell.
         Fixed dangling ref in $sth after parent $dbh destroyed
           with thanks to <a href="mailto:il@rol.ru">il@rol.ru</a> for the bug report #13151
         Fixed prerequisites to include Storable thanks to Michael Schwern.
         Fixed take_imp_data to be more practical.

         Change to require perl 5.6.1 (as advertised in 2003) not 5.6.0.
         Changed internals to be more strictly coded thanks to Andy Lester.
         Changed warning about multiple copies of Driver.xst found in @INC
           to ignore duplicated directories thanks to Ed Avis.
         Changed Driver.xst to enable drivers to define an dbd_st_prepare_sv
           function where the statement parameter is an SV. That enables
           compiled drivers to support SQL strings that are UTF-8.
         Changed "use DBI" to only set $DBI::connect_via if not already set.
         Changed docs to clarify pre-method clearing of err values.

         Added ability for DBI::ProfileData to edit profile path on loading.
           This enables aggregation of different SQL statements into the same
           profile node - very handy when not using placeholders or when working
           multiple separate tables for the same thing (ie logtable_2005_11_28)
         Added $sth-&gt;{ParamTypes} specification thanks to Dean Arnold.
         Added $h-&gt;{Callbacks} attribute to enable code hooks to be invoked
           when certain methods are called. For example:
           $dbh-&gt;{Callbacks}-&gt;{prepare} = sub { ... };
           With thanks to David Wheeler for the kick start.
         Added $h-&gt;{ChildHandles} (using weakrefs) thanks to Sam Tregar
           I've recoded it in C so there's no significant performance impact.
         Added $h-&gt;{Type} docs (returns 'dr', 'db', or 'st')
         Adding trace message in DESTROY if InactiveDestroy enabled.
         Added %drhs = DBI-&gt;installed_drivers();

         Ported DBI::ProfileDumper::Apache to mod_perl2 RC5+
           thanks to Philip M. Golluci

         Fixed DBI::DBD::Metadata generation of type_info_all thanks to Steffen Goeldner
           (driver authors who have used it should rerun it).

         Updated docs for NULL Value placeholders thanks to Brian Campbell.

         Added multi-keyfield nested hash fetching to fetchall_hashref()
           thanks to Zhuang (John) Li for polishing up my draft.
         Added registered driver prefixes: amzn_ for DBD::Amazon and yaswi_ for DBD::Yaswi.

           parent even if DESTROY called other methods.
         Fixed DBD::Proxy method calls to not alter $@.
         Fixed DBD::File problem with encoding pragma thanks to Erik Rijkers.

         Changed DBI::DBD docs to use =head3/=head4 pod thanks to
           Jonathan Leffler. This may generate warnings for perl 5.6.
         Changed DBI::PurePerl to set autoflush on trace filehandle.
         Changed DBD::Proxy to treat Username as a local attribute
           so recent DBI version can be used with old DBI::ProxyServer.

         Updated docs for primary_key_info and primary_keys.
         Updated docs to clarify that the default fetchrow_hashref behaviour,
           of returning a ref to a new hash for each row, will not change.
         Updated err/errstr/state docs for DBD authors thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
         Updated handle/attribute docs for DBD authors thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
         Corrected and updated LongReadLen docs thanks to Bart Lateur.
         Added DBD::JDBC as a registered driver.

           to not consider scalar values for execute tuple count. See docs.
         Changed DBD::File to enable ShowErrorStatement by default,
           which affects DBD::File subclasses such as DBD::CSV and DBD::DBM.
         Changed use DBI qw(:utils) tag to include $neat_maxlen.
         Updated Roadmap and ToDo.

         Added data_string_diff() data_string_desc() and data_diff()

         Fixed rare core dump during global destruction thanks to Mark Jason Dominus.
         Fixed risk of utf8 flag persisting from one row to the next.

           to have the same number of elements.
         Changed bind_param_array() to error if placeholder number &lt;= 0.
         Changed execute_array() definition, and default implementation,

         Changed Test::More prerequisite to Test::Simple (which is also the name
           of the distribution both are packaged in) to work around ppm behaviour.

         Corrected docs to say that get/set of unknown attribute generates
           a warning and is no longer fatal. Thanks to Vadim.

         Changed TraceLevel 1 to not show recursive/nested calls.
         Changed getting or setting an invalid attribute to no longer be
           a fatal error but generate a warning instead.
         Changed selectall_arrayref() to call finish() if
           $attr-&gt;{MaxRows} is defined.
         Changed all tests to use Test::More and enhanced the tests thanks
           to Stevan Little and Andy Lester. See <a href="http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/">http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/</a>
         Changed Test::More minimum prerequisite version to 0.40 (2001).
         Changed DBI::Profile header to include the date and time.

         Removed "may change" warnings from the docs for table_info(),
           primary_key_info(), and foreign_key_info() methods.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.42</b> <b>(svn</b> <b>rev</b> <b>222)</b> <b>-</b> <b>12</b> <b>Mar</b> <b>2004</b>

         Fixed DBD_ATTRIB_DELETE macro thanks to Marco Paskamp.
         Fixed DBI::PurePerl looks_like_number() and $DBI::rows.
         Fixed ref($h)-&gt;can("foo") to not croak.

         Changed attributes (NAME, TYPE etc) of non-executed statement
           handle to be undef instead of triggering an error.
         Changed ShowErrorStatement to apply to more $dbh methods.
         Changed DBI_TRACE env var so just does this at load time:
           DBI-&gt;trace(split '=', $ENV{DBI_TRACE}, 2);
         Improved "invalid number of parameters" error message.
         Added DBI::common as base class for DBI::db, DBD::st etc.
         Moved methods common to all handles into DBI::common.

         Major tracing enhancement:

         Added $h-&gt;parse_trace_flags("foo|SQL|7") to map a group of
           trace flags into the corresponding trace flag bits.
         Added automatic calling of parse_trace_flags() if
           setting the trace level to a non-numeric value:
           $h-&gt;{TraceLevel}="foo|SQL|7"; $h-&gt;trace("foo|SQL|7");
           DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Driver(TraceLevel=SQL|foo):...", ...);
           Currently no trace flags have been defined.
         Added to, and reworked, the trace documentation.
         Added dbivport.h for driver authors to use.

         Major driver additions that Jeff Zucker and I have been working on:

         Added DBI::SQL::Nano a 'smaller than micro' SQL parser
           with an SQL::Statement compatible API. If SQL::Statement
           is installed then DBI::SQL::Nano becomes an empty subclass
           of SQL::Statement, unless the DBI_SQL_NANO env var is true.
         Added DBD::File, modified to use DBI::SQL::Nano.
         Added DBD::DBM, an SQL interface to DBM files using DBD::File.

         Documentation changes:

         Corrected typos in docs thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
         Corrected execute_for_fetch example thanks to Dean Arnold.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.41</b> <b>(svn</b> <b>rev</b> <b>130)</b> <b>-</b> <b>22</b> <b>Feb</b> <b>2004</b>
         Fixed execute_for_array() so tuple_status parameter is optional
           as per docs, thanks to Ed Avis.
         Fixed execute_for_array() docs to say that it returns undef if
           any of the execute() calls fail.
         Fixed take_imp_data() test on m68k reported by Christian Hammers.
         Fixed write_typeinfo_pm inconsistencies in DBI::DBD::Metadata
           thanks to Andy Hassall.
         Fixed $h-&gt;{TraceLevel} to not return DBI-&gt;trace trace level
           which it used to if DBI-&gt;trace trace level was higher.

         Changed set_err() to append to errstr, with a leading "\n" if it's
           not empty, so that multiple error/warning messages are recorded.
         Changed trace to limit elements dumped when an array reference is
           returned from a method to the max(40, $DBI::neat_maxlen/10)
           so that fetchall_arrayref(), for example, doesn't flood the trace.
         Changed trace level to be a four bit integer (levels 0 thru 15)
           and a set of topic flags (no topics have been assigned yet).
         Changed column_info() to check argument count.
         Extended bind_param() TYPE attribute specification to imply
           standard formating of value, eg SQL_DATE implies 'YYYY-MM-DD'.

         Added way for drivers to indicate 'success with info' or 'warning'
           by setting err to "0" for warning and "" for information.
           Both values are false and so don't trigger RaiseError etc.
           Thanks to Steffen Goeldner for the original idea.
         Added $h-&gt;{HandleSetErr} = sub { ... } to be called at the
           point that an error, warn, or info state is recorded.
           The code can alter the err, errstr, and state values
           (e.g., to promote an error to a warning, or the reverse).
         Added $h-&gt;{PrintWarn} attribute to enable printing of warnings
           recorded by the driver. Defaults to same value as $^W (perl -w).
         Added $h-&gt;{ErrCount} attribute, incremented whenever an error is
           recorded by the driver via set_err().
         Added $h-&gt;{Executed} attribute, set if do()/execute() called.
         Added \%attr parameter to foreign_key_info() method.
         Added ref count of inner handle to "DESTROY ignored for outer" msg.
         Added Win32 build config checks to DBI::DBD thanks to Andy Hassall.
         Added bind_col to Driver.xst so drivers can define their own.
         Added TYPE attribute to bind_col and specified the expected
           driver behaviour.

         Major update to signal handling docs thanks to Lincoln Baxter.
         Corrected dbiproxy usage doc thanks to Christian Hammers.
         Corrected type_info_all index hash docs thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
         Corrected type_info COLUMN_SIZE to chars not bytes thanks to Dean Arnold.
         Corrected get_info() docs to include details of DBI::Const::GetInfoType.
         Clarified that $sth-&gt;{PRECISION} is OCTET_LENGTH for char types.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.40</b> <b>-</b> <b>07</b> <b>Jan</b> <b>2004</b>
         Fixed handling of CachedKids when DESTROYing threaded handles.
         Fixed sql_user_name() in DBI::DBD::Metadata (used by write_getinfo_pm)
           to use $dbh-&gt;{Username}. Driver authors please update your code.

         Changed connect_cached() when running under Apache::DBI
           to route calls to Apache::DBI::connect().

         Added CLONE() to DBD::Sponge and DBD::ExampleP.
         Added warning when starting a new thread about any loaded driver
           which does not have a CLONE() function.
         Added new prepare_cache($sql, \%attr, 3) option to manage Active handles.
         Added SCALE and NULLABLE support to DBD::Sponge.

         Fixed STORE to not clear error during nested DBI call, again/better,
           thanks to Tony Bowden for the report and helpful test case.
         Fixed DBI dispatch to not try to use AUTOLOAD for driver methods unless
           the method has been declared (as methods should be when using AUTOLOAD).
           This fixes a problem when the Attribute::Handlers module is loaded.
         Fixed cwd check code to use $Config{path_sep} thanks to Steve Hay.
         Fixed unqualified croak() calls thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
         Fixed DBD::ExampleP TYPE and PRECISION attributes thanks to Tom Lowery.
         Fixed tracing of methods that only get traced at high trace levels.

         The level 1 trace no longer includes nested method calls so it generally
           just shows the methods the application explicitly calls.
         Added line to trace log (level&gt;=4) when err/errstr is cleared.
         Updated docs for InactiveDestroy and point out where and when the
           trace includes the process id.
         Update DBI::DBD docs thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
         Removed docs saying that the DBI-&gt;data_sources method could be
           passed a $dbh. The $dbh-&gt;data_sources method should be used instead.
         Added link to 'DBI recipes' thanks to Giuseppe Maxia:
           <a href="http://gmax.oltrelinux.com/dbirecipes.html">http://gmax.oltrelinux.com/dbirecipes.html</a> (note that this
           is not an endorsement that the recipies are 'optimal')

         Note: There is a bug in perl 5.8.2 when configured with threads
         and debugging enabled (bug #24463) which causes a DBI test to fail.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.38</b> <b>-</b> <b>21</b> <b>Aug</b> <b>2003</b>
         NOTE: The DBI now requires perl version 5.6.0 or later.

         Changed DBI-&gt;available_drivers to not hide DBD::Sponge.
         Updated/moved placeholder docs to a better place thanks to Johan Vromans.
         Changed dbd_db_do4 api in Driver.xst to match dbd_st_execute (return int,
           not bool), relevant only to driver authors.
         Changed neat(), and thus trace(), so strings marked as utf8 are presented
           in double quotes instead of single quotes and are not sanitized.

         Added $dbh-&gt;data_sources method.
         Added $dbh-&gt;last_insert_id method.
         Added $sth-&gt;execute_for_fetch($fetch_tuple_sub, \@tuple_status) method.

         Changed t/40profile.t to not require Time::HiRes.
         Changed DBI::ProxyServer to load DBI only on first request, which
           helps threaded server mode, thanks to Bob Showalter.
         Changed execute_array() return value from row count to executed
           tuple count, and now the ArrayTupleStatus attribute is mandatory.
           NOTE: That is an API definition change that may affect your code.
         Changed CompatMode attribute to also disable attribute 'quick FETCH'.
         Changed attribute FETCH to be slightly faster thanks to Stas Bekman.

         Added workaround for perl bug #17575 tied hash nested FETCH
           thanks to Silvio Wanka.
         Added Username and Password attributes to connect(..., \%attr) and so
           also embedded in DSN like "dbi:Driver(Username=user,Password=pass):..."
           Username and Password can't contain ")", ",", or "=" characters.
           The predence is DSN first, then \%attr, then $user &amp; $pass parameters,
           and finally the DBI_USER &amp; DBI_PASS environment variables.
           The Username attribute is stored in the $dbh but the Password is not.
         Added ProxyServer HOWTO configure restrictions docs thanks to Jochen Wiedmann.
         Added MaxRows attribute to selectcol_arrayref prompted by Wojciech Pietron.
         Added dump_handle as a method not just a DBI:: utility function.
         Added on-demand by-row data feed into execute_array() using code ref,
           or statement handle. For example, to insert from a select:
           $insert_sth-&gt;execute_array( { ArrayTupleFetch =&gt; $select_sth, ... } )
         Added warning to trace log when $h-&gt;{foo}=... is ignored due to
           invalid prefix (e.g., not 'private_').

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.35</b> <b>-</b> <b>07</b> <b>Mar</b> <b>2003</b>
         Fixed memory leak in fetchrow_hashref introduced in DBI 1.33.
         Fixed various DBD::Proxy errors introduced in DBI 1.33.
         Fixed to ANSI C in dbd_dr_data_sources thanks to Jonathan Leffler.
         Fixed $h-&gt;can($method_name) to return correct code ref.
         Removed DBI::Format from distribution as it's now part of the
           separate DBI::Shell distribution by Tom Lowery.
         Updated DBI::DBD docs with a note about the CLONE method.
         Updated DBI::DBD docs thanks to Jonathan Leffler.
         Updated DBI::DBD::Metadata for perl 5.5.3 thanks to Jonathan Leffler.
         Added note to install_method docs about setup_driver() method.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.34</b> <b>-</b> <b>28</b> <b>Feb</b> <b>2003</b>
         Fixed DBI::DBD docs to refer to DBI::DBD::Metadata thanks to Jonathan Leffler.
         Fixed dbi_time() compile using BorlandC on Windows thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
         Fixed profile tests to do enough work to measure on Windows.
         Fixed disconnect_all() to not be required by drivers.

         Added $okay = $h-&gt;can($method_name) to check if a method exists.
         Added DBD::*::*-&gt;install_method($method_name, \%attr) so driver private
           methods can be 'installed' into the DBI dispatcher and no longer
           need to be called using $h-&gt;func(..., $method_name).

         Enhanced $dbh-&gt;clone() and documentation.
         Enhanced docs to note that dbi_time(), and thus profiling, is limited
           to only millisecond (seconds/1000) resolution on Windows.
         Removed old DBI::Shell from distribution and added Tom Lowery's improved
           version to the Bundle::DBI file.
         Updated minimum version numbers for modules in Bundle::DBI.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.33</b> <b>-</b> <b>27</b> <b>Feb</b> <b>2003</b>
         NOTE: Future versions of the DBI *will not* support perl 5.6.0 or earlier.
         : Perl 5.6.1 will be the minimum supported version.

         NOTE: The "old-style" connect: DBI-&gt;connect($database, $user, $pass, $driver);
         : has been deprecated for several years and will now generate a warning.
         : It will be removed in a later release. Please change any old connect() calls.

         Added $dbh2 = $dbh1-&gt;clone to make a new connection to the database
           that is identical to the original one. clone() can be called even after
           the original handle has been disconnected. See the docs for more details.

         Fixed merging of profile data to not sum DBIprof_FIRST_TIME values.
         Fixed unescaping of newlines in DBI::ProfileData thanks to Sam Tregar.
         Fixed Taint bug with fetchrow_hashref with help from Bradley Baetz.
         Fixed $dbh-&gt;{Active} for DBD::Proxy, reported by Bob Showalter.
         Fixed STORE to not clear error during nested DBI call,
           thanks to Tony Bowden for the report and helpful test case.
         Fixed DBI::PurePerl error clearing behaviour.
         Fixed dbi_time() and thus DBI::Profile on Windows thanks to Smejkal Petr.
         Fixed problem that meant ShowErrorStatement could show wrong statement,
          thanks to Ron Savage for the report and test case.
         Changed Apache::DBI hook to check for $ENV{MOD_PERL} instead of
           $ENV{GATEWAY_INTERFACE} thanks to Ask Bjoern Hansen.
         No longer tries to dup trace logfp when an interpreter is being cloned.
         Database handles no longer inherit shared $h-&gt;err/errstr/state storage
           from their drivers, so each $dbh has it's own $h-&gt;err etc. values
           and is no longer affected by calls made on other dbh's.
           Now when a dbh is destroyed it's err/errstr/state values are copied
           up to the driver so checking $DBI::errstr still works as expected.

         Build / portability fixes:
           Fixed t/40profile.t to not use Time::HiRes.
           Fixed t/06attrs.t to not be locale sensitive, reported by Christian Hammers.
           Fixed sgi compiler warnings, reported by Paul Blake.
           Fixed build using make -j4, reported by Jonathan Leffler.
           Fixed build and tests under VMS thanks to Craig A. Berry.

         Documentation changes:
           Documented $high_resolution_time = dbi_time() function.
           Documented that bind_col() can take an attribute hash.
           Clarified documentation for ParamValues attribute hash keys.
           Many good DBI documentation tweaks from Jonathan Leffler,
             including a major update to the DBI::DBD driver author guide.
           Clarified that execute() should itself call finish() if it's
             called on a statement handle that's still active.
           Clarified $sth-&gt;{ParamValues}. Driver authors please note.
           Removed "NEW" markers on some methods and attributes and
             added text to each giving the DBI version it was added in,
             if it was added after DBI 1.21 (Feb 2002).

         Changes of note for authors of all drivers:
           Added SQL_DATA_TYPE, SQL_DATETIME_SUB, NUM_PREC_RADIX, and
             INTERVAL_PRECISION fields to docs for type_info_all. There were
             already in type_info(), but type_info_all() didn't specify the
             index values.  Please check and update your type_info_all() code.
           Added DBI::DBD::Metadata module that auto-generates your drivers
             get_info and type_info_all data and code, thanks mainly to
             Jonathan Leffler and Steffen Goeldner. If you've not implemented
             get_info and type_info_all methods and your database has an ODBC
             driver available then this will do all the hard work for you!
           Drivers should no longer pass Err, Errstr, or State to _new_drh
             or _new_dbh functions.
           Please check that you support the slightly modified behaviour of
             $sth-&gt;{ParamValues}, e.g., always return hash with keys if possible.

         Changes of note for authors of compiled drivers:
           Added dbd_db_login6 &amp; dbd_st_finish3 prototypes thanks to Jonathan Leffler.
           All dbd_*_*() functions implemented by drivers must have a
             corresponding #define dbd_*_* &lt;driver_prefix&gt;_*_* otherwise
             the driver may not work with a future release of the DBI.

         Changes of note for authors of drivers which use Driver.xst:
           Some new method hooks have been added are are enabled by
             defining corresponding macros:
                 $drh-&gt;data_sources()      - dbd_dr_data_sources
                 $dbh-&gt;do()                - dbd_db_do4
           The following methods won't be compiled into the driver unless
             the corresponding macro has been #defined:
                 $drh-&gt;disconnect_all()    - dbd_discon_all

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.32</b> <b>-</b> <b>01</b> <b>Dec</b> <b>2002</b>
         Fixed to work with 5.005_03 thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa (I've not tested it).
         Reenabled taint tests (accidentally left disabled) spotted by Bradley Baetz.
         Improved docs for FetchHashKeyName attribute thanks to Ian Barwick.
         Fixed core dump if fetchrow_hashref given bad argument (name of attribute
           with a value that wasn't an array reference), spotted by Ian Barwick.
         Fixed some compiler warnings thanks to David Wheeler.
         Updated Steven Hirsch's enhanced proxy work (seems I left out a bit).
         Made t/40profile.t tests more reliable, reported by Randy, who is part of
           the excellent CPAN testers team: <a href="http://testers.cpan.org/">http://testers.cpan.org/</a>
           (Please visit, see the valuable work they do and, ideally, join in!)

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.31</b> <b>-</b> <b>29</b> <b>Nov</b> <b>2002</b>
         The fetchall_arrayref method, when called with a $maxrows parameter,
           no longer gives an error if called again after all rows have been
           fetched. This simplifies application logic when fetching in batches.
           Also added batch-fetch while() loop example to the docs.
         The proxy now supports non-lazy (synchronous) prepare, positioned
           updates (for selects containing 'for update'), PlRPC config set
           via attributes, and accurate propagation of errors, all thanks
           to Steven Hirsch (plus a minor fix from Sean McMurray and doc
           tweaks from Michael A Chase).
         The DBI_AUTOPROXY env var can now hold the full dsn of the proxy driver
           plus attributes, like "dbi:Proxy(proxy_foo=&gt;1):host=...".
         Added TaintIn &amp; TaintOut attributes to give finer control over
           tainting thanks to Bradley Baetz.
         The RootClass attribute no longer ignores failure to load a module,
           but also doesn't try to load a module if the class already exists,
           with thanks to James FitzGibbon.
         HandleError attribute works for connect failures thanks to David Wheeler.
         The connect() RaiseError/PrintError message now includes the username.
         Changed "last handle unknown or destroyed" warning to be a trace message.
         Removed undocumented $h-&gt;event() method.
         Further enhancements to DBD::PurePerl accuracy.
         The CursorName attribute now defaults to undef and not an error.

         DBI::Profile changes:
           New DBI::ProfileDumper, DBI::ProfileDumper::Apache, and
           DBI::ProfileData modules (to manage the storage and processing
           of profile data), plus dbiprof program for analyzing profile
           data - with many thanks to Sam Tregar.
           Added $DBI::err (etc) tied variable lookup time to profile.
           Added time for DESTROY method into parent handles profile (used to be ignored).

         Documentation changes:
           Documented $dbh = $sth-&gt;{Database} attribute.
           Documented $dbh-&gt;connected(...) post-connection call when subclassing.
           Updated some minor doc issues thanks to H.Merijn Brand.
           Updated Makefile.PL example in DBI::DBD thanks to KAWAI,Takanori.
           Fixed execute_array() example thanks to Peter van Hardenberg.

         Changes for driver authors, not required but strongly recommended:
           Change DBIS to DBIc_DBISTATE(imp_xxh)   [or imp_dbh, imp_sth etc]
           Change DBILOGFP to DBIc_LOGPIO(imp_xxh) [or imp_dbh, imp_sth etc]
           Any function from which all instances of DBIS and DBILOGFP are
           removed can also have dPERLINTERP removed (a good thing).
           All use of the DBIh_EVENT* macros should be removed.
           Major update to DBI::DBD docs thanks largely to Jonathan Leffler.
           Add these key values: 'Err' =&gt; \my $err, 'Errstr' =&gt; \my $errstr,
           to the hash passed to DBI::_new_dbh() in your driver source code.
           That will make each $dbh have it's own $h-&gt;err and $h-&gt;errstr
           values separate from other $dbh belonging to the same driver.
           If you have a ::db or ::st DESTROY methods that do nothing
           you can now remove them - which speeds up handle destruction.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.30</b> <b>-</b> <b>18</b> <b>Jul</b> <b>2002</b>
         Fixed problems with selectrow_array, selectrow_arrayref, and
           selectall_arrayref introduced in DBI 1.29.
         Fixed FETCHing a handle attribute to not clear $DBI::err etc (broken in 1.29).
         Fixed core dump at trace level 9 or above.
         Fixed compilation with perl 5.6.1 + ithreads (i.e. Windows).
         Changed definition of behaviour of selectrow_array when called in a scalar
           context to match fetchrow_array.
         Corrected selectrow_arrayref docs which showed selectrow_array thanks to Paul DuBois.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.29</b> <b>-</b> <b>15</b> <b>Jul</b> <b>2002</b>
         NOTE: This release changes the specified behaviour for the
         : fetchrow_array method when called in a scalar context:
         : The DBI spec used to say that it would return the FIRST field.
         : Which field it returns (i.e., the first or the last) is now undefined.
         : This does not affect statements that only select one column, which is
         : usually the case when fetchrow_array is called in a scalar context.
         : FYI, this change was triggered by discovering that the fetchrow_array
         : implementation in Driver.xst (used by most compiled drivers)
         : didn't match the DBI specification. Rather than change the code
         : to match, and risk breaking existing applications, I've changed the
         : specification (that part was always of dubious value anyway).

         NOTE: Future versions of the DBI may not support for perl 5.5 much longer.
         : If you are still using perl 5.005_03 you should be making plans to
         : upgrade to at least perl 5.6.1, or 5.8.0. Perl 5.8.0 is due to be
         : released in the next week or so.  (Although it's a "point 0" release,
         : it is the most thoroughly tested release ever.)

         Added XS/C implementations of selectrow_array, selectrow_arrayref, and
           selectall_arrayref to Driver.xst. See DBI 1.26 Changes for more info.
         Removed support for the old (fatally flawed) "5005" threading model.
         Added support for new perl 5.8 iThreads thanks to Gerald Richter.
           (Threading support and safety should still be regarded as beta
           quality until further notice. But it's much better than it was.)
         Updated the "Threads and Thread Safety" section of the docs.
         The trace output can be sent to STDOUT instead of STDERR by using
           "STDOUT" as the name of the file, i.e., $h-&gt;trace(..., "STDOUT")
         Added pointer to perlreftut, perldsc, perllol, and perlboot manuals
           into the intro section of the docs, suggested by Brian McCain.
         Fixed DBI::Const::GetInfo::* pod docs thanks to Zack Weinberg.
         Some changes to how $dbh method calls are treated by DBI::Profile:
           Meta-data methods now clear $dbh-&gt;{Statement} on entry.
           Some $dbh methods are now profiled as if $dbh-&gt;{Statement} was empty
           (because thet're unlikely to actually relate to its contents).
         Updated dbiport.h to ppport.h from perl 5.8.0.
         Tested with perl 5.5.3 (vanilla, Solaris), 5.6.1 (vanilla, Solaris), and
           perl 5.8.0 (RC3@17527 with iThreads &amp; Multiplicity on Solaris and FreeBSD).

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.28</b> <b>-</b> <b>14</b> <b>Jun</b> <b>2002</b>
         Added $sth-&gt;{ParamValues} to return a hash of the most recent
           values bound to placeholders via bind_param() or execute().
           Individual drivers need to be updated to support it.
         Enhanced ShowErrorStatement to include ParamValues if available:
           "DBD::foo::st execute failed: errstr [for statement ``...'' with params: 1='foo']"
         Further enhancements to DBD::PurePerl accuracy.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.27</b> <b>-</b> <b>13</b> <b>Jun</b> <b>2002</b>
         Fixed missing column in C implementation of fetchall_arrayref()
           thanks to Philip Molter for the prompt reporting of the problem.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.26</b> <b>-</b> <b>13</b> <b>Jun</b> <b>2002</b>
         Fixed t/40profile.t to work on Windows thanks to Smejkal Petr.
         Fixed $h-&gt;{Profile} to return undef, not error, if not set.
         Fixed DBI-&gt;available_drivers in scalar context thanks to Michael Schwern.

         Added C implementations of selectrow_arrayref() and fetchall_arrayref()
           in Driver.xst.  All compiled drivers using Driver.xst will now be
           faster making those calls. Most noticeable with fetchall_arrayref for
           many rows or selectrow_arrayref with a fast query. For example, using
           DBD::mysql a selectrow_arrayref for a single row using a primary key
           is ~20% faster, and fetchall_arrayref for 20000 rows is twice as fast!
           Drivers just need to be recompiled and reinstalled to enable it.
           The fetchall_arrayref speed up only applies if $slice parameter is not used.
         Added $max_rows parameter to fetchall_arrayref() to optionally limit
           the number of rows returned. Can now fetch batches of rows.
         Added MaxRows attribute to selectall_arrayref()
           which then passes it to fetchall_arrayref().
         Changed selectrow_array to make use of selectrow_arrayref.
         Trace level 1 now shows first two parameters of all methods
           (used to only for that for some, like prepare,execute,do etc)
         Trace indicator for recursive calls (first char on trace lines)
           now starts at 1 not 2.

         Documented that $h-&gt;func() does not trigger RaiseError etc
           so applications must explicitly check for errors.
         DBI::Profile with DBI_PROFILE now shows percentage time inside DBI.
         HandleError docs updated to show that handler can edit error message.
         HandleError subroutine interface is now regarded as stable.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.25</b> <b>-</b> <b>05</b> <b>Jun</b> <b>2002</b>
         Fixed build problem on Windows and some compiler warnings.
         Fixed $dbh-&gt;{Driver} and $sth-&gt;{Statement} for driver internals
           These are 'inner' handles as per behaviour prior to DBI 1.16.
         Further minor improvements to DBI::PurePerl accuracy.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.24</b> <b>-</b> <b>04</b> <b>Jun</b> <b>2002</b>
         Fixed reference loop causing a handle/memory leak
           that was introduced in DBI 1.16.
         Fixed DBI::Format to work with 'filehandles' from IO::Scalar
           and similar modules thanks to report by Jeff Boes.
         Fixed $h-&gt;func for DBI::PurePerl thanks to Jeff Zucker.
         Fixed $dbh-&gt;{Name} for DBI::PurePerl thanks to Dean Arnold.

         Added DBI method call profiling and benchmarking.
           This is a major new addition to the DBI.
           See $h-&gt;{Profile} attribute and DBI::Profile module.
           For a quick trial, set the DBI_PROFILE environment variable and
           run your favourite DBI script. Try it with DBI_PROFILE set to 1,
           then try 2, 4, 8, 10, and -10. Have fun!

         Added execute_array() and bind_param_array() documentation
           with thanks to Dean Arnold.
         Added notes about the DBI having not yet been tested with iThreads
           (testing and patches for SvLOCK etc welcome).
         Removed undocumented Handlers attribute (replaced by HandleError).
         Tested with 5.5.3 and 5.8.0 RC1.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.23</b> <b>-</b> <b>25</b> <b>May</b> <b>2002</b>
         Greatly improved DBI::PurePerl in performance and accuracy.
         Added more detail to DBI::PurePerl docs about what's not supported.
         Fixed undef warnings from t/15array.t and DBD::Sponge.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.22</b> <b>-</b> <b>22</b> <b>May</b> <b>2002</b>
         Added execute_array() and bind_param_array() with special thanks
           to Dean Arnold. Not yet documented. See t/15array.t for examples.
           All drivers now automatically support these methods.

         Clarified potentials problems with prepare_cached() thanks to Stephen Clouse.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.21</b> <b>-</b> <b>07</b> <b>Feb</b> <b>2002</b>
         The minimum supported perl version is now 5.005_03.

         Fixed DBD::Proxy support for AutoCommit thanks to Jochen Wiedmann.
         Fixed DBI::ProxyServer bind_param(_inout) handing thanks to Oleg Mechtcheriakov.
         Fixed DBI::ProxyServer fetch loop thanks to <a href="mailto:nobull@mail.com">nobull@mail.com</a>.
         Fixed install_driver do-the-right-thing with $@ on error. It, and connect(),
           will leave $@ empty on success and holding the error message on error.
           Thanks to Jay Lawrence, Gavin Sherlock and others for the bug report.
         Fixed fetchrow_hashref to assign columns to the hash left-to-right
           so later fields with the same name overwrite earlier ones
           as per DBI &lt; 1.15, thanks to Kay Roepke.

         Changed tables() to use quote_indentifier() if the driver returns a
           true value for $dbh-&gt;<a href="../man29/get_info.29.html">get_info</a>(29) # SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR
         Changed ping() so it no longer triggers RaiseError/PrintError.
         Changed connect() to not call $class-&gt;install_driver unless needed.
         Changed DESTROY to catch fatal exceptions and append to $@.

         Added ISO SQL/CLI &amp; ODBCv3 data type definitions thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
         Removed the definition of SQL_BIGINT data type constant as the value is
           inconsistent between standards (ODBC=-5, SQL/CLI=25).
         Added $dbh-&gt;column_info(...) thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
         Added $dbh-&gt;foreign_key_info(...) thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
         Added $dbh-&gt;quote_identifier(...) insipred by Simon Oliver.
         Added $dbh-&gt;set_err(...) for DBD authors and DBI subclasses
           (actually been there for a while, now expanded and documented).
         Added $h-&gt;{HandleError} = sub { ... } addition and/or alternative
           to RaiseError/PrintError. See the docs for more info.
         Added $h-&gt;{TraceLevel} = N attribute to set/get trace level of handle
           thus can set trace level via an (eg externally specified) DSN
           using the embedded attribute syntax:
             $dsn = 'dbi:DB2(PrintError=1,TraceLevel=2):dbname';
           Plus, you can also now do: local($h-&gt;{TraceLevel}) = N;
           (but that leaks a little memory in some versions of perl).
         Added some call tree information to trace output if trace level &gt;= 3
           With thanks to Graham Barr for the stack walking code.
         Added experimental undocumented $dbh-&gt;preparse(), see t/preparse.t
           With thanks to Scott T. Hildreth for much of the work.
         Added Fowler/Noll/Vo hash type as an option to DBI::hash().

         Documentation changes:

         Added DBI::Changes so now you can "perldoc DBI::Changes", yeah!
         Added selectrow_arrayref &amp; selectrow_hashref docs thanks to Doug Wilson.
         Added 'Standards Reference Information' section to docs to gather
           together all references to relevant on-line standards.
         Added link to poop.sourceforge.net into the docs thanks to Dave Rolsky.
         Added link to hyperlinked BNF for SQL92 thanks to Jeff Zucker.
         Added 'Subclassing the DBI' docs thanks to Stephen Clouse, and
           then changed some of them to reflect the new approach to subclassing.
         Added stronger wording to description of $h-&gt;{private_*} attributes.
         Added docs for DBI::hash.

         Driver API changes:

         Now a COPY of the DBI-&gt;connect() attributes is passed to the driver
           connect() method, so it can process and delete any elements it wants.
           Deleting elements reduces/avoids the explicit
             $dbh-&gt;{$_} = $attr-&gt;{$_} foreach keys %$attr;
           that DBI-&gt;connect does after the driver connect() method returns.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.20</b> <b>-</b> <b>24</b> <b>Aug</b> <b>2001</b>
         WARNING: This release contains two changes that may affect your code.
         : Any code using selectall_hashref(), which was added in March 2001, WILL
         : need to be changed. Any code using fetchall_arrayref() with a non-empty
         : hash slice parameter may, in a few rare cases, need to be changed.
         : See the change list below for more information about the changes.
         : See the DBI documentation for a description of current behaviour.

         Fixed memory leak thanks to Toni Andjelkovic.
         Changed fetchall_arrayref({ foo=&gt;1, ...}) specification again (sorry):
           The key names of the returned hashes is identical to the letter case of
           the names in the parameter hash, regardless of the L&lt;/FetchHashKeyName&gt;
           attribute. The letter case is ignored for matching.
         Changed fetchall_arrayref([...]) array slice syntax specification to
           clarify that the numbers in the array slice are perl index numbers
           (which start at 0) and not column numbers (which start at 1).
         Added { Columns=&gt;... } and { Slice =&gt;... } attributes to selectall_arrayref()
           which is passed to fetchall_arrayref() so it can fetch hashes now.
         Added a { Columns =&gt; [...] } attribute to selectcol_arrayref() so that
           the list it returns can be built from more than one column per row.
           Why? Consider my %hash = @{$dbh-&gt;selectcol_arrayref($sql,{ Columns=&gt;[1,2]})}
           to return id-value pairs which can be used directly to build a hash.
         Added $hash_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchall_hashref( $key_field )
           which returns a ref to a hash with, typically, one element per row.
           $key_field is the name of the field to get the key for each row from.
           The value of the hash for each row is a hash returned by fetchrow_hashref.
         Changed selectall_hashref to return a hash ref (from fetchall_hashref)
           and not an array of hashes as it has since DBI 1.15 (end March 2001).
           WARNING: THIS CHANGE WILL BREAK ANY CODE USING selectall_hashref()!
           Sorry, but I think this is an important regularization of the API.
           To get previous selectall_hashref() behaviour (an array of hash refs)
           change $ary_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectall_hashref( $statement, undef, @bind);
               to $ary_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref($statement, { Columns=&gt;{} }, @bind);
         Added NAME_lc_hash, NAME_uc_hash, NAME_hash statement handle attributes.
           which return a ref to a hash of field_name =&gt; field_index (0..n-1) pairs.
         Fixed select_hash() example thanks to Doug Wilson.
         Removed (unbundled) DBD::ADO and DBD::Multiplex from the DBI distribution.
           The latest versions of those modules are available from CPAN sites.
         Added $dbh-&gt;begin_work. This method causes AutoCommit to be turned
           off just until the next commit() or rollback().
           Driver authors: if the DBIcf_BegunWork flag is set when your commit or
           rollback method is called then please turn AutoCommit on and clear the
           DBIcf_BegunWork flag. If you don't then the DBI will but it'll be much
           less efficient and won't handle error conditions very cleanly.
         Retested on perl 5.4.4, but the DBI won't support 5.4.x much longer.
         Added text to SUPPORT section of the docs:
           For direct DBI and DBD::Oracle support, enhancement, and related work
           I am available for consultancy on standard commercial terms.
         Added text to ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS section of the docs:
           Much of the DBI and DBD::Oracle was developed while I was Technical
           Director (CTO) of the Paul Ingram Group (www.ig.co.uk).  So I'd
           especially like to thank Paul for his generosity and vision in
           supporting this work for many years.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.19</b> <b>-</b> <b>20</b> <b>Jul</b> <b>2001</b>
         Made fetchall_arrayref({ foo=&gt;1, ...}) be more strict to the specification
           in relation to wanting hash slice keys to be lowercase names.
           WARNING: If you've used fetchall_arrayref({...}) with a hash slice
           that contains keys with uppercase letters then your code will break.
           (As far as I recall the spec has always said don't do that.)
         Fixed $sth-&gt;execute() to update $dbh-&gt;{Statement} to $sth-&gt;{Statement}.
         Added row number to trace output for fetch method calls.
         Trace level 1 no longer shows fetches with row&gt;1 (to reduce output volume).
         Added $h-&gt;{FetchHashKeyName} = 'NAME_lc' or 'NAME_uc' to alter
           behaviour of fetchrow_hashref() method. See docs.
         Added type_info quote caching to quote() method thanks to Dean Kopesky.
           Makes using quote() with second data type param much much faster.
         Added type_into_all() caching to type_info(), spotted by Dean Kopesky.
         Added new API definition for table_info() and tables(),
           driver authors please note!
         Added primary_key_info() to DBI API thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
         Added primary_key() to DBI API as simpler interface to primary_key_info().
         Indent and other fixes for DBI::DBD doc thanks to H.Merijn Brand.
         Added prepare_cached() insert_hash() example thanks to Doug Wilson.
         Removed false docs for fetchall_hashref(), use fetchall_arrayref({}).

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.18</b> <b>-</b> <b>04</b> <b>Jun</b> <b>2001</b>
         Fixed that altering ShowErrorStatement also altered AutoCommit!
           Thanks to Jeff Boes for spotting that clanger.
         Fixed DBD::Proxy to handle commit() and rollback(). Long overdue, sorry.
         Fixed incompatibility with perl 5.004 (but no one's using that right? :)
         Fixed connect_cached and prepare_cached to not be affected by the order
           of elements in the attribute hash. Spotted by Mitch Helle-Morrissey.
         Fixed version number of DBI::Shell
           reported by Stuhlpfarrer Gerhard and others.
         Defined and documented table_info() attribute semantics (ODBC compatible)
           thanks to Olga Voronova, who also implemented then in DBD::Oracle.
         Updated Win32::DBIODBC (Win32::ODBC emulation) thanks to Roy Lee.

         Reimplemented fetchrow_hashref in C, now fetches about 25% faster!
         Changed behaviour if both PrintError and RaiseError are enabled
           to simply do both (in that order, obviously :)
         Slight reduction in DBI handle creation overhead.
         Fixed $dbh-&gt;{Driver} &amp; $sth-&gt;{Database} to return 'outer' handles.

         Added $dbh-&gt;{Statement} aliased to most recent child $sth-&gt;{Statement}.
         Added $h-&gt;{ShowErrorStatement}=1 to cause the appending of the
           relevant Statement text to the RaiseError/PrintError text.
         Modified type_info to always return hash keys in uppercase and
           to not require uppercase 'DATA_TYPE' key from type_info_all.
           Thanks to Jennifer Tong and Rob Douglas.
         Added \%attr param to tables() and table_info() methods.

         Added _get_fbav and _set_fbav methods for Perl driver developers
           (see ExampleP driver for perl usage). Drivers which don't use
           one of these methods (either via XS or Perl) are not compliant.
         DBI trace now shows adds " at yourfile.pl line nnn"!
         PrintError and RaiseError now prepend driver and method name.
         The available_drivers method no longer returns NullP or Sponge.
         Added $dbh-&gt;{Name}.
         Added $dbh-&gt;quote($value, $data_type).
         Added more hints to install_driver failure message.
         Added DBD::Proxy and DBI::ProxyServer (from Jochen Wiedmann).
         Added $DBI::neat_maxlen to control truncation of trace output.
         Added $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref and $dbh-&gt;selectrow_array methods.

         Added $h-&gt;trace_msg($msg) to write to trace log.
         Added @bool = DBI::looks_like_number(@ary).
         Many assorted improvements to the DBI docs.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.93</b> <b>-</b> <b>13</b> <b>Feb</b> <b>1998</b>
         Fixed DBI::DBD::dbd_postamble bug causing 'Driver.xsi not found' errors.
         Changes to handling of 'magic' values in neatsvpv (used by trace).
         execute (in Driver.xst) stops binding after first bind error.
         This release requires drivers to be rebuilt.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.92</b> <b>-</b> <b>03</b> <b>Feb</b> <b>1998</b>
         Fixed per-handle memory leak (with many thanks to Irving Reid).
         Added $dbh-&gt;prepare_cached() caching variant of $dbh-&gt;prepare.
         Added some attributes:
           $h-&gt;{Active}       is the handle 'Active' (vague concept) (boolean)
           $h-&gt;{Kids}         e.g. number of sth's associated with a dbh
           $h-&gt;{ActiveKids}   number of the above which are 'Active'
           $dbh-&gt;{CachedKids} ref to prepare_cached sth cache
         Added support for general-purpose 'private_' attributes.
         Added experimental support for subclassing the DBI: see t/subclass.t
         Added SQL_ALL_TYPES to exported :sql_types.
         Added dbd_dbi_dir() and dbd_dbi_arch_dir() to DBI::DBD module so that
         DBD Makefile.PLs can work with the DBI installed in non-standard locations.
         Fixed 'Undefined value' warning and &amp;sv_no output from neatsvpv/trace.
         Fixed small 'once per interpreter' leak.
         Assorted minor documentation fixes.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.91</b> <b>-</b> <b>10</b> <b>Dec</b> <b>1997</b>
         NOTE: This fix may break some existing scripts:
         DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:...",$user,$pass) was not setting AutoCommit and PrintError!
         DBI-&gt;connect(..., { ... }) no longer sets AutoCommit or PrintError twice.
         DBI-&gt;connect(..., { RaiseError=&gt;1 }) now croaks if connect fails.
         Fixed $fh parameter of $sth-&gt;dump_results;
         Added default statement DESTROY method which carps.
         Added default driver DESTROY method to silence AUTOLOAD/__DIE__/CGI::Carp
         Added more SQL_* types to %EXPORT_TAGS and @EXPORT_OK.
         Assorted documentation updates (mainly clarifications).
         Added workaround for perl's 'sticky lvalue' bug.
         Added better warning for bind_col(umns) where fields==0.
         Fixed to build okay with 5.004_54 with or without USE_THREADS.
         Note that the DBI has not been tested for thread safety yet.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.90</b> <b>-</b> <b>06</b> <b>Sep</b> <b>1997</b>
         Can once again be built with Perl 5.003.
         The DBI class can be subclassed more easily now.
         InactiveDestroy fixed for drivers using the *.xst template.
         Slightly faster handle creation.
         Changed prototype for dbd_*_*_attrib() to add extra param.
         Note: 0.90, 0.89 and possibly some other recent versions have
         a small memory leak. This will be fixed in the next release.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.89</b> <b>-</b> <b>25</b> <b>Jul</b> <b>1997</b>
         Minor fix to neatsvpv (mainly used for debug trace) to workaround
         bug in perl where SvPV removes IOK flag from an SV.
         Minor updates to the docs.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.88</b> <b>-</b> <b>22</b> <b>Jul</b> <b>1997</b>
         Fixed build for perl5.003 and Win32 with Borland.
         Fixed documentation formatting.
         Fixed DBI_DSN ignored for old-style connect (with explicit driver).
         Fixed AutoCommit in DBD::ExampleP
         Fixed $h-&gt;trace.
         The DBI can now export SQL type values: use DBI ':sql_types';
         Modified Driver.xst and renamed DBDI.h to dbd_xsh.h

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.87</b> <b>-</b> <b>18</b> <b>Jul</b> <b>1997</b>
         Fixed minor type clashes.
         Added more docs about placeholders and bind values.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.86</b> <b>-</b> <b>16</b> <b>Jul</b> <b>1997</b>
         Fixed failed connect causing 'unblessed ref' and other errors.
         Drivers must handle AutoCommit FETCH and STORE else DBI croaks.
         Added $h-&gt;{LongReadLen} and $h-&gt;{LongTruncOk} attributes for BLOBS.
         Added DBI_USER and DBI_PASS env vars. See connect docs for usage.
         Added DBI-&gt;trace() to set global trace level (like per-handle $h-&gt;trace).
         PERL_DBI_DEBUG env var renamed DBI_DEBUG (old name still works for now).
         Updated docs, including commit, rollback, AutoCommit and Transactions sections.
         Added bind_param method and execute(@bind_values) to docs.
         Fixed fetchall_arrayref.

         Since the DBIS structure has change the internal version numbers have also
         changed (DBIXS_VERSION == 9 and DBISTATE_VERSION == 9) so drivers will have
         to be recompiled. The test is also now more sensitive and the version
         mismatch error message now more clear about what to do. Old drivers are
         likely to core dump (this time) until recompiled for this DBI. In future
         DBI/DBD version mismatch will always produce a clear error message.

         Note that this DBI release contains and documents many new features
         that won't appear in drivers for some time. Driver writers might like
         to read perldoc DBI::DBD and comment on or apply the information given.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.85</b> <b>-</b> <b>25</b> <b>Jun</b> <b>1997</b>
         NOTE: New-style connect now defaults to AutoCommit mode unless
         { AutoCommit =&gt; 0 } specified in connect attributes. See the docs.
         AutoCommit attribute now defined and tracked by DBI core.
         Drivers should use/honour this and not implement their own.
         Added pod doc changes from Andreas and Jonathan.
         New DBI_DSN env var default for connect method. See docs.
         Documented the func method.
         Fixed "Usage: DBD::_::common::DESTROY" error.
         Fixed bug which set some attributes true when there value was fetched.
         Added new internal DBIc_set() macro for drivers to use.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.84</b> <b>-</b> <b>20</b> <b>Jun</b> <b>1997</b>
         Added $h-&gt;{PrintError} attribute which, if set true, causes all errors to
         trigger a warn().
         New-style DBI-&gt;connect call now automatically sets PrintError=1 unless
         { PrintError =&gt; 0 } specified in the connect attributes. See the docs.
         The old-style connect with a separate driver parameter is deprecated.
         Fixed fetchrow_hashref.
         Renamed $h-&gt;debug to $h-&gt;trace() and added a trace filename arg.
         Assorted other minor tidy-ups.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.83</b> <b>-</b> <b>11</b> <b>Jun</b> <b>1997</b>
         Added driver specification syntax to DBI-&gt;connect data_source
         parameter: DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:driver:...', $user, $passwd);
         The DBI-&gt;data_sources method should return data_source
         names with the appropriate 'dbi:driver:' prefix.
         DBI-&gt;connect will warn if \%attr is true but not a hash ref.
         Added the new fetchrow methods:
           @row_ary  = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_array;
           $ary_ref  = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref;
           $hash_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_hashref;
         The old fetch and fetchrow methods still work.
         Driver implementors should implement the new names for
         fetchrow_array and fetchrow_arrayref ASAP (use the xs ALIAS:
         directive to define aliases for fetch and fetchrow).
         Fixed occasional problems with t/examp.t test.
         Added automatic errstr reporting to the debug trace output.
         Added the DBI FAQ from Alligator Descartes in module form for
         easy reading via "perldoc DBI::FAQ". Needs reformatting.
         Unknown driver specific attribute names no longer croak.
         Fixed problem with internal neatsvpv macro.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.82</b> <b>-</b> <b>23</b> <b>May</b> <b>1997</b>
         Added $h-&gt;{RaiseError} attribute which, if set true, causes all errors to
         trigger a die(). This makes it much easier to implement robust applications
         in terms of higher level eval { ... } blocks and rollbacks.
         Added DBI-&gt;data_sources($driver) method for implementation by drivers.
         The quote method now returns the string NULL (without quotes) for undef.
         Added VMS support thanks to Dan Sugalski.
         Added a 'quick start guide' to the README.
         Added neatsvpv function pointer to DBIS structure to make it available for
         use by drivers. A macro defines neatsvpv(sv,len) as (DBIS-&gt;neatsvpv(sv,len)).
         Old XS macro SV_YES_NO changes to standard boolSV.
         Since the DBIS structure has change the internal version numbers have also
         changed (DBIXS_VERSION == 8 and DBISTATE_VERSION == 8) so drivers will have
         to be recompiled.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.81</b> <b>-</b> <b>07</b> <b>May</b> <b>1997</b>
         Minor fix to let DBI build using less modern perls.
         Fixed a suprious typo warning.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.80</b> <b>-</b> <b>06</b> <b>May</b> <b>1997</b>
         Builds with no changes on NT using perl5.003_99 (with thanks to Jeffrey Urlwin).
         Automatically supports Apache::DBI (with thanks to Edmund Mergl).
           DBI scripts no longer need to be modified to make use of Apache::DBI.
         Added a ping method and an experimental connect_test_perf method.
         Added a fetchhash and fetch_all methods.
         The func method no longer pre-clears err and errstr.
         Added ChopBlanks attribute (currently defaults to off, that may change).
           Support for the attribute needs to be implemented by individual drivers.
         Reworked tests into standard t/*.t form.
         Added more pod text.  Fixed assorted bugs.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.79</b> <b>-</b> <b>07</b> <b>Apr</b> <b>1997</b>
         Minor release. Tidied up pod text and added some more descriptions
         (especially disconnect). Minor changes to DBI.xs to remove compiler
         warnings.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.78</b> <b>-</b> <b>28</b> <b>Mar</b> <b>1997</b>
         Greatly extended the pod documentation in DBI.pm, including the under
         used bind_columns method. Use 'perldoc DBI' to read after installing.
         Fixed $h-&gt;err. Fetching an attribute value no longer resets err.
         Added $h-&gt;{InactiveDestroy}, see documentation for details.
         Improved debugging of cached ('quick') attribute fetches.
         errstr will return err code value if there is no string value.
         Added DBI/W32ODBC to the distribution. This is a pure-perl experimental
         DBI emulation layer for Win32::ODBC. Note that it's unsupported, your
         mileage will vary, and bug reports without fixes will probably be ignored.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.77</b> <b>-</b> <b>21</b> <b>Feb</b> <b>1997</b>
         Removed erroneous $h-&gt;errstate and $h-&gt;errmsg methods from DBI.pm.
         Added $h-&gt;err, $h-&gt;errstr and $h-&gt;state default methods in DBI.xs.
         Updated informal DBI API notes in DBI.pm. Updated README slightly.
         DBIXS.h now correctly installed into INST_ARCHAUTODIR.
         (DBD authors will need to edit their Makefile.PL's to use
         -I$(INSTALLSITEARCH)/auto/DBI -I$(INSTALLSITEARCH)/DBI)

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.76</b> <b>-</b> <b>03</b> <b>Feb</b> <b>1997</b>
         Fixed a compiler type warnings (pedantic IRIX again).

         Fix problem introduced by a change in Perl5.003_XX.
         Updated README and DBI.pm docs.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.74</b> <b>-</b> <b>14</b> <b>Jan</b> <b>1997</b>
         Dispatch now sets dbi_debug to the level of the current handle
         (this makes tracing/debugging individual handles much easier).
         The '&gt;&gt; DISPATCH' log line now only logged at debug &gt;= 3 (was 2).
         The $csr-&gt;NUM_OF_FIELDS attribute can be set if not &gt;0 already.
         You can log to a file using the env var PERL_DBI_DEBUG=/tmp/dbi.log.
         Added a type cast needed by IRIX.
         No longer sets perl_destruct_level unless debug set &gt;= 4.
         Make compatible with PerlIO and sfio.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.73</b> <b>-</b> <b>10</b> <b>Oct</b> <b>1996</b>
         Fixed some compiler type warnings (IRIX).
         Fixed DBI-&gt;internal-&gt;{DebugLog} = $filename.
         Made debug log file unbuffered.
         Added experimental bind_param_inout method to interface.
         Usage: $dbh-&gt;bind_param_inout($param, \$value, $maxlen [, \%attribs ])
         (only currently used by DBD::Oracle at this time.)

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.72</b> <b>-</b> <b>23</b> <b>Sep</b> <b>1996</b>
         Using an undefined value as a handle now gives a better
         error message (mainly useful for emulators like Oraperl).
         $dbh-&gt;do($sql, @params) now works for binding placeholders.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.71</b> <b>-</b> <b>10</b> <b>Jul</b> <b>1996</b>
         Removed spurious abort() from invalid handle check.
         Added quote method to DBI interface and added test.

         Added extra invalid handle check (dbih_getcom)
         Fixed broken $dbh-&gt;quote method.
         Added check for old GCC in Makefile.PL

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.69</b> <b>-</b> <b>07</b> <b>May</b> <b>1996</b>
         Fixed small memory leak.
         Clarified the behaviour of DBI-&gt;connect.
         $dbh-&gt;do now returns '0E0' instead of 'OK'.
         Fixed "Can't read $DBI::errstr, lost last handle" problem.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.68</b> <b>-</b> <b>02</b> <b>Mar</b> <b>1996</b>
         Changes to suit perl5.002 and site_lib directories.
         Detects old versions ahead of new in @INC.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.67</b> <b>-</b> <b>15</b> <b>Feb</b> <b>1996</b>
         Trivial change to test suite to fix a problem shown up by the
         Perl5.002gamma release Test::Harness.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.66</b> <b>-</b> <b>29</b> <b>Jan</b> <b>1996</b>
         Minor changes to bring the DBI into line with 5.002 mechanisms,
         specifically the xs/pm VERSION checking mechanism.
         No functionality changes. One no-last-handle bug fix (rare problem).
         Requires 5.002 (beta2 or later).

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.65</b> <b>-</b> <b>23</b> <b>Oct</b> <b>1995</b>
         Added $DBI::state to hold SQL CLI / ODBC SQLSTATE value.
         SQLSTATE "00000" (success) is returned as "" (false), all else is true.
         If a driver does not explicitly initialise it (via $h-&gt;{State} or
         DBIc_STATE(imp_xxh) then $DBI::state will automatically return "" if
         $DBI::err is false otherwise "S1000" (general error).
         As always, this is a new feature and liable to change.

         The is *no longer* a default error handler!
         You can add your own using push(@{$h-&gt;{Handlers}}, sub { ... })
         but be aware that this interface may change (or go away).

         The DBI now automatically clears $DBI::err, errstr and state before
         calling most DBI methods. Previously error conditions would persist.
         Added DBIh_CLEAR_ERROR(imp_xxh) macro.

         DBI now EXPORT_OK's some utility functions, neat($value),
         neat_list(@values) and dump_results($sth).

         Slightly enhanced t/min.t minimal test script in an effort to help
         narrow down the few stray core dumps that some porters still report.

         Renamed readblob to blob_read (old name still works but warns).
         Added default blob_copy_to_file method.

         Added $sth = $dbh-&gt;tables method. This returns an $sth for a query
         which has these columns: TABLE_CATALOGUE, TABLE_OWNER, TABLE_NAME,
         TABLE_TYPE, REMARKS in that order. The TABLE_CATALOGUE column
         should be ignored for now.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.64</b> <b>-</b> <b>23</b> <b>Oct</b> <b>1995</b>
         Fixed 'disconnect invalidates 1 associated cursor(s)' problem.
         Drivers using DBIc_ACTIVE_on/off() macros should not need any changes
         other than to test for DBIc_ACTIVE_KIDS() instead of DBIc_KIDS().
         Fixed possible core dump in dbih_clearcom during global destruction.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.63</b> <b>-</b> <b>01</b> <b>Sep</b> <b>1995</b>
         Minor update. Fixed uninitialised memory bug in method
         attribute handling and streamlined processing and debugging.
         Revised usage definitions for bind_* methods and readblob.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.62</b> <b>-</b> <b>26</b> <b>Aug</b> <b>1995</b>
         Added method redirection method $h-&gt;func(..., $method_name).
         This is now the official way to call private driver methods
         that are not part of the DBI standard.  E.g.:
             @ary = $sth-&gt;func('ora_types');
         It can also be used to call existing methods. Has very low cost.

         $sth-&gt;bind_col columns now start from 1 (not 0) to match SQL.
         $sth-&gt;bind_columns now takes a leading attribute parameter (or undef),
         e.g., $sth-&gt;bind_columns($attribs, \$col1 [, \$col2 , ...]);

         Added handy DBD_ATTRIBS_CHECK macro to vet attribs in XS.
         Added handy DBD_ATTRIB_GET_SVP, DBD_ATTRIB_GET_BOOL and
         DBD_ATTRIB_GET_IV macros for handling attributes.

         Fixed STORE for NUM_OF_FIELDS and NUM_OF_PARAMS.
         Added FETCH for NUM_OF_FIELDS and NUM_OF_PARAMS.

         Dispatch no longer bothers to call _untie().
         Faster startup via install_method/_add_dispatch changes.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.61</b> <b>-</b> <b>22</b> <b>Aug</b> <b>1995</b>
         Added $sth-&gt;bind_col($column, \$var [, \%attribs ]);

         This method enables perl variable to be directly and automatically
         updated when a row is fetched. It requires no driver support
         (if the driver has been written to use DBIS-&gt;get_fbav).
         Currently \%attribs is unused.

         Added $sth-&gt;bind_columns(\$var [, \$var , ...]);

         This method is a short-cut for bind_col which binds all the
         columns of a query in one go (with no attributes). It also
         requires no driver support.

         Added $sth-&gt;bind_param($parameter, $var [, \%attribs ]);

         This method enables attributes to be specified when values are
         bound to placeholders. It also enables binding to occur away
         from the execute method to improve execute efficiency.
         The DBI does not provide a default implementation of this.
         See the DBD::Oracle module for a detailed example.

         The DBI now provides default implementations of both fetch and
         fetchrow.  Each is written in terms of the other. A driver is
         expected to implement at least one of them.

         More macro and assorted structure changes in DBDXS.h. Sorry!
         The old dbihcom definitions have gone. All fields have macros.
         The imp_xxh_t type is now used within the DBI as well as drivers.
         Drivers must set DBIc_NUM_FIELDS(imp_sth) and DBIc_NUM_PARAMS(imp_sth).

         test.pl includes a trivial test of bind_param and bind_columns.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.60</b> <b>-</b> <b>17</b> <b>Aug</b> <b>1995</b>
         This release has significant code changes but much less
         dramatic than the previous release. The new implementors data
         handling mechanism has matured significantly (don't be put off
         by all the struct typedefs in DBIXS.h, there's just to make it
         easier for drivers while keeping things type-safe).

         The DBI now includes two new methods:

         do            $dbh-&gt;do($statement)

         This method prepares, executes and finishes a statement. It is
         designed to be used for executing one-off non-select statements
         where there is no benefit in reusing a prepared statement handle.

         fetch         $array_ref = $sth-&gt;fetch;

         This method is the new 'lowest-level' row fetching method. The
         previous @row = $sth-&gt;fetchrow method now defaults to calling
         the fetch method and expanding the returned array reference.

         The DBI now provides fallback attribute FETCH and STORE functions
         which drivers should call if they don't recognise an attribute.

         THIS RELEASE IS A GOOD STARTING POINT FOR DRIVER DEVELOPERS!
         Study DBIXS.h from the DBI and Oracle.xs etc from DBD::Oracle.
         There will be further changes in the interface but nothing
         as dramatic as these last two releases! (I hope :-)

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.59</b> <b>-</b> <b>15</b> <b>Aug</b> <b>1995</b>
         NOTE: THIS IS AN UNSTABLE RELEASE!

         Major reworking of internal data management!
         Performance improvements and memory leaks fixed.
         Added a new NullP (empty) driver and a -m flag
         to test.pl to help check for memory leaks.
         Study DBD::Oracle version 0.21 for more details.
         (Comparing parts of v0.21 with v0.20 may be useful.)

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>0.58</b> <b>-</b> <b>21</b> <b>Jun</b> <b>1995</b>
         Added DBI-&gt;internal-&gt;{DebugLog} = $filename;
         Reworked internal logging.
         Added $VERSION.
         Made disconnect_all a compulsory method for drivers.
