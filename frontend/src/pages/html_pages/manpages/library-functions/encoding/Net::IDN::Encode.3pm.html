</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::IDN::Encode - Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Net::IDN::Encode ':all';
         my $a = domain_to_ascii("müller.example.org");
         my $e = email_to_ascii("POSTMASTER@例。テスト");
         my $u = domain_to_unicode('EXAMPLE.XN--11B5BS3A9AJ6G');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides an easy-to-use interface for encoding and decoding Internationalized Domain Names
       (IDNs).

       IDNs use characters drawn from a large repertoire (Unicode), but IDNA allows the non-ASCII characters to
       be represented using only the ASCII characters already allowed in so-called host names today (letter-
       digit-hyphen, "/[A-Z0-9-]/i").

       Use this module if you just want to convert domain names (or email addresses), using whatever IDNA
       standard is the best choice at the moment.

       You should be familiar with Unicode support in perl, as this module expects correctly encoded input. See
       perlunitut, perluniintro and perlunicode for details.

</pre><h4><b>UNICODE</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       To convert labels correctly between Unicode and ASCII, each character in the label must be present in the
       Unicode version supported by your perl.  Consequently, this module will refuse to convert labels with new
       Unicode characters on older perl versions (see below).

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       By default, this module does not export any subroutines. You may use the ":all" tag to import everything.
       You can also use regular expressions such as "/^to_/" or "/^email_/" to select some of the functions, see
       Exporter for details.

       The following functions are available:

       to_ascii( $label, %param )
           Converts  a  single  label  $label  to  ASCII. Will throw an exception on invalid input. If $label is
           already a valid ASCII domain label (including most NON-LDH labels such as those used for SRV  records
           and fake A-labels), this function will never fail but return $label as-is if conversion would fail.

           This function takes the following optional parameters (%param):

           AllowUnassigned
               (boolean)  If  set  to  a  true  value,  code  points  that are unassigned in the Unicode version
               supported by your perl are allowed. This is an extension over UTS #46.

               While this increases the number of labels that can be converted successfully (especially on older
               perls) and may thus maximizes the compatibility with domain names created under  future  versions
               of  Unicode,  it  also  introduces  the risk of incorrect conversions.  Characters added in later
               versions of Unicode might have properties that affect the conversion; if these properties are not
               known on your version of perl, you might therefore end up with an incorrect conversion.

               The default is false.

           UseSTD3ASCIIRules
               (boolean) If set to a true value, checks the label for compliance with  STD 3  (RFC 1123)  syntax
               for  host  name  parts. The exact checks done depend on the IDNA standard used. Usually, you will
               want to set this to true.

               Please note that UseSTD3ASCIIRules only affects the conversion between  ASCII  labels  (A-labels)
               and Unicode labels (U-labels). Labels that are in ASCII may still be passed-through as-is.

               For historical reasons, the default is false (unlike "domain_to_ascii").

           TransitionalProcessing
               (boolean) If set to true, the conversion will be compatible with IDNA2003. This only affects four
               characters: 'ß' (U+00DF), 'ς' (U+03C2), ZWJ (U+200D) and ZWNJ (U+200C). Usually, you will want to
               set this to false.

               The default is false.

           This  function  does  not  handle strings that consist of multiple labels (such as domain names). Use
           "domain_to_ascii" instead.

       to_unicode( $label, %param )
           Converts a single label $label to Unicode. Will throw an exception on invalid input. If $label is  an
           ASCII  label  (including  most NON-LDH labels such as those used for SRV records), this function will
           not fail but return $label as-is if conversion would fail.

           This function takes the same optional parameters as "to_ascii", with the same defaults.

           If $label is already in ASCII, this function will never fail but return $label as is as a last resort
           (i.e. pass-through).

           This function takes the following optional parameters (%param):

           AllowUnassigned
           UseSTD3ASCIIRules
               See "to_unicode" above. Please note that  there  is  no  need  for  "TransitionalProcessing"  for
               "to_unicode".

           This  function  does  not  handle strings that consist of multiple labels (such as domain names). Use
           "domain_to_unicode" instead.

       domain_to_ascii( $label, %param )
           Converts all labels of the  hostname  $domain  (with  labels  separated  by  dots)  to  ASCII  (using
           "to_ascii"). Will throw an exception on invalid input.

           This function takes the following optional parameters (%param):

           AllowUnassigned
           TransitionalProcessing
               See "to_unicode" above.

           UseSTD3ASCIIRules
               (boolean)  If  set  to a true value, checks the label for compliance with STD 3 (RFC 1123) syntax
               for host name parts.

               The default is true (unlike "to_ascii").

           This function will convert all dots to ASCII, i.e. to U+002E (full stop).  The  following  characters
           are  recognized  as  dots: U+002E (full stop), U+3002 (ideographic full stop), U+FF0E (fullwidth full
           stop), U+FF61 (halfwidth ideographic full stop).

       domain_to_unicode( $domain, %param )
           Converts all labels of the hostname $domain (with labels separated by dots) to Unicode. Will throw an
           exception on invalid input.

           This function takes the same optional parameters as "domain_to_ascii", with the same defaults.

           This function takes the following optional parameters (%param):

           AllowUnassigned
           UseSTD3ASCIIRules
               See "domain_to_unicode"  above.  Please  note  that  there  is  no  "TransitionalProcessing"  for
               "domain_to_unicode".

           This function will preserve the original version of dots.  The following characters are recognized as
           dots:  U+002E  (full  stop),  U+3002  (ideographic  full  stop), U+FF0E (fullwidth full stop), U+FF61
           (halfwidth ideographic full stop).

       email_to_ascii( $email, %param )
           Converts the domain part (right hand side, separated by an at sign) of an RFC 2821/2822 email address
           to ASCII, using "domain_to_ascii". May throw an exception on invalid input.

           It takes the same parameters as "domain_to_ascii".

           This function currently does not handle internationalization of  the  local-part  (left  hand  side).
           Future  versions of this module might implement an ASCII conversion for the local-part, should one be
           standardized.

           This function will convert the at sign to ASCII, i.e. to U+0040 (commercial at),  as  well  as  label
           separators.   The  following  characters  are  recognized as at signs: U+0040 (commercial at), U+FE6B
           (small commercial at) and U+FF20 (fullwidth commercial at).

       email_to_unicode( $email, %param )
           Converts the domain part (right hand side, separated by an at sign) of an RFC 2821/2822 email address
           to Unicode, using "domain_to_unicode". May throw an exception on invalid input.

           It takes the same parameters as "domain_to_unicode".

           This function currently does not handle internationalization of  the  local-part  (left  hand  side).
           Future versions of this module might implement a conversion from ASCII for the local-part, should one
           be standardized.

           This  function  will  preserve the original version of at signs (and label separators). The following
           characters are recognized as at signs: U+0040 (commercial  at),  U+FE6B  (small  commercial  at)  and
           U+FF20 (fullwidth commercial at).
