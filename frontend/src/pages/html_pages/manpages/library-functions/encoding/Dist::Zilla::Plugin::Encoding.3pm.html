</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Encoding - set the encoding of arbitrary files

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 6.032

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This plugin allows you to explicitly set the encoding on some files in your distribution. You can either
       specify the exact set of files (with the "filenames" parameter) or provide the regular expressions to
       check (using "match").

       In your <u>dist.ini</u>:

         [Encoding]
         encoding = Latin-3

         filename = t/esperanto.t  ; this file is Esperanto
         match     = ^t/urkish/    ; these are all Turkish

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>encoding</b>
       This is the encoding to set on the selected files. The special value "bytes" can be used to indicate raw
       files that should not be encoded.

   <b>filenames</b>
       This is an arrayref of filenames to have their encoding set.

   <b>matches</b>
       This is an arrayref of regular expressions.  Any file whose name matches one of these regex will have its
       encoding set.

   <b>ignore</b>
       This is an arrayref of regular expressions.  Any file whose name matches one of these regex will <b>not</b> have
       its encoding set. Useful to ignore a few files that would otherwise be selected by "matches".
