</pre><h4><b>ABSTRACT</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements RFC 2047 &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047&gt; MIME encoding for an unstructured
       field body of the email header.  It can also be used for RFC 822 &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822&gt;
       'text' token.  However, it cannot be used directly for the whole header with the field name or for the
       structured header fields like From, To, Cc, Message-Id, etc...  There are 3 encoding names supported by
       this module: "MIME-Header", "MIME-B" and "MIME-Q".

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Decode method takes an unstructured field body of the email header (or RFC 822
       &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822&gt; 'text' token) as its input and decodes each MIME encoded-word from
       input string to a sequence of bytes according to RFC 2047 &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047&gt; and RFC
       2231 &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2231&gt;.  Subsequently, each sequence of bytes with the corresponding
       MIME charset is decoded with the Encode module and finally, one output string is returned.  Text parts of
       the input string which do not contain MIME encoded-word stay unmodified in the output string.  Folded
       newlines between two consecutive MIME encoded-words are discarded, others are preserved in the output
       string.  "MIME-B" can decode Base64 variant, "MIME-Q" can decode Quoted-Printable variant and
       "MIME-Header" can decode both of them.  If Encode module does not support particular MIME charset or
       chosen variant then an action based on CHECK flags is performed (by default, the MIME encoded-word is not
       decoded).

       Encode method takes a scalar string as its input and uses strict UTF-8 encoder for encoding it to UTF-8
       bytes.  Then a sequence of UTF-8 bytes is encoded into MIME encoded-words ("MIME-Header" and "MIME-B" use
       a Base64 variant while "MIME-Q" uses a Quoted-Printable variant) where each MIME encoded-word is limited
       to 75 characters.  MIME encoded-words are separated by "CRLF SPACE" and joined to one output string.
       Output string is suitable for unstructured field body of the email header.

       Both encode and decode methods propagate CHECK flags when encoding and decoding the MIME charset.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Versions prior to 2.22 (part of Encode 2.83) have a malfunctioning decoder and encoder.  The MIME encoder
       infamously inserted additional spaces or discarded white spaces between consecutive MIME encoded-words,
       which led to invalid MIME headers produced by this module.  The MIME decoder had a tendency to discard
       white spaces, incorrectly interpret data or attempt to decode Base64 MIME encoded-words as Quoted-
       Printable.  These problems were fixed in version 2.22.  It is highly recommended not to use any version
       prior 2.22!

       Versions prior to 2.24 (part of Encode 2.87) ignored CHECK flags.  The MIME encoder used not strict utf8
       encoder for input Unicode strings which could lead to invalid UTF-8 sequences.  MIME decoder used also
       not strict utf8 decoder and additionally called the decode method with a "Encode::FB_PERLQQ" flag (thus
       user-specified CHECK flags were ignored).  Moreover, it automatically croaked when a MIME encoded-word
       contained unknown encoding.  Since version 2.24, this module uses strict UTF-8 encoder and decoder.  And
       CHECK flags are correctly propagated.

       Since version 2.22 (part of Encode 2.83), the MIME encoder should be fully compliant to RFC 2047
       &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047&gt; and RFC 2231 &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2231&gt;.  Due to the
       aforementioned bugs in previous versions of the MIME encoder, there is a <u>less</u> <u>strict</u> compatible mode for
       the MIME decoder which is used by default.  It should be able to decode MIME encoded-words encoded by pre
       2.22 versions of this module.  However, note that this is not correct according to RFC 2047
       &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047&gt;.

       In default <u>not</u> <u>strict</u> mode the MIME decoder attempts to decode every substring which looks like a MIME
       encoded-word.  Therefore, the MIME encoded-words do not need to be separated by white space.  To enforce
       a correct <u>strict</u> mode, set variable $Encode::MIME::Header::STRICT_DECODE to 1 e.g. by localizing:

         use Encode::MIME::Header;
         local $Encode::MIME::Header::STRICT_DECODE = 1;
