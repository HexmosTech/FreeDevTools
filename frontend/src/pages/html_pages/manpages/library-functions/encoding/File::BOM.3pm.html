</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides functions for handling unicode byte order marks, which are to be found at the
       beginning of some files and streams.

       For details about what a byte order mark is, see &lt;<a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/faq/utf_bom.html">http://www.unicode.org/unicode/faq/utf_bom.html</a>#BOM&gt;

       The intention of File::BOM is for files with BOMs to be readable as seamlessly as possible, regardless of
       the encoding used. To that end, several different interfaces are available, as shown in the synopsis
       above.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>%bom2enc</b>
       Maps Byte Order marks to their encodings.

       The  keys  of this hash are strings which represent the BOMs, the values are their encodings, in a format
       which is understood by Encode

       The encodings represented in this hash are: UTF-8, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE and UTF-32LE

   <b>%enc2bom</b>
       A reverse-lookup hash for bom2enc, with a few aliases used in Encode, namely utf8, iso-10646-1 and UCS-2.

       Note that UTF-16, UTF-32 and  UCS-4  are  not  included  in  this  hash.  Mainly  because  Encode::encode
       automatically puts BOMs on output. See Encode::Unicode

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>open_bom</b>
           $encoding = open_bom(HANDLE, $filename, $default_mode)

           ($encoding, $spill) = open_bom(HANDLE, $filename, $default_mode)

       opens HANDLE for reading on $filename, setting the mode to the appropriate encoding for the BOM stored in
       the file.

       On  failure, a fatal error is raised, see the DIAGNOSTICS section for details on how to catch these. This
       is in order to allow the return value(s) to be used for other purposes.

       If the file doesn't contain a BOM, $default_mode is used instead. Hence:

           open_bom(FH, 'my_file.txt', ':utf8')

       Opens my_file.txt for reading in an appropriate encoding found from the BOM in that file, or as  a  UTF-8
       file if none is found.

       In the absence of a $default_mode argument, the following 2 calls should be equivalent:

           open_bom(FH, 'no_bom.txt');

           open(FH, '&lt;', 'no_bom.txt');

       If an undefined value is passed as the handle, a symbol will be generated for it like <b>open()</b> does:

           # create filehandle on the fly
           $enc = open_bom(my $fh, $filename, ':utf8');
           $line = &lt;$fh&gt;;

       The filehandle will be cued up to read after the BOM. Unseekable files (e.g.  fifos) will cause croaking,
       unless  called  in  list  context  to  catch spillage from the handle. Any spillage will be automatically
       decoded from the encoding, if found.

           e.g.

           # croak if my_socket is unseekable
           open_bom(FH, 'my_socket');

           # keep spillage if my_socket is unseekable
           ($encoding, $spillage) = open_bom(FH, 'my_socket');

           # discard any spillage from open_bom
           ($encoding) = open_bom(FH, 'my_socket');

   <b>defuse</b>
           $enc = defuse(FH);

           ($enc, $spill) = defuse(FH);

       FH should be a filehandle opened for reading, it will have the relevant encoding layer pushed onto it  be
       binmode if a BOM is found. Spillage should be Unicode, not bytes.

       Any  uncaptured  spillage  will  be silently lost. If the handle is unseekable, use list context to avoid
       data loss.

       If no BOM is found, the mode will be unaffected.

   <b>decode_from_bom</b>
           $unicode_string = decode_from_bom($string, $default, $check)

           ($unicode_string, $encoding) = decode_from_bom($string, $default, $check)

       Reads a BOM from the beginning of $string, decodes $string (minus the BOM) and returns it  to  you  as  a
       perl unicode string.

       if $string doesn't have a BOM, $default is used instead.

       $check, if supplied, is passed to Encode::decode as the third argument.

       If there's no BOM and no default, the original string is returned and encoding is ''.

       See Encode

   <b>get_encoding_from_filehandle</b>
           $encoding = get_encoding_from_filehandle(HANDLE)

           ($encoding, $spillage) = get_encoding_from_filehandle(HANDLE)

       Returns the encoding found in the given filehandle.

       The handle should be opened in a non-unicode way (e.g. mode '&lt;:bytes') so that the BOM can be read in its
       natural state.

       After  calling,  the handle will be set to read at a point after the BOM (or at the beginning of the file
       if no BOM was found)

       If called in scalar context, unseekable handles cause a <b>croak()</b>.

       If called in list context, unseekable handles  will  be  read  byte-by-byte  and  any  spillage  will  be
       returned. See <b>get_encoding_from_stream()</b>

   <b>get_encoding_from_stream</b>
           ($encoding, $spillage) = get_encoding_from_stream(*FH);

       Read  a  BOM from an unrewindable source. This means reading the stream one byte at a time until either a
       BOM is found or every possible BOM is ruled out. Any non-BOM bytes read from the handle will be  returned
       in $spillage.

       If  a BOM is found and the spillage contains a partial character (judging by the expected character width
       for the encoding) more bytes will be read from  the  handle  to  ensure  that  a  complete  character  is
       returned.

       Spillage is always in bytes, not characters.

       This  function  is  less  efficient  than get_encoding_from_filehandle, but should work just as well on a
       seekable handle as on an unseekable one.

   <b>get_encoding_from_bom</b>
           ($encoding, $offset) = get_encoding_from_bom($string)

       Returns the encoding and length in bytes of the BOM in $string.

       If there is no BOM, an empty string is returned and $offset is zero.

       To get the data from the string, the following should work:

           use Encode;

           my($encoding, $offset) = get_encoding_from_bom($string);

           if ($encoding) {
               $string = decode($encoding, substr($string, $offset))
           }

</pre><h4><b>PerlIO::via</b> <b>interface</b></h4><pre>
       File::BOM can be used as a PerlIO::via interface.

           open(HANDLE, '&lt;:via(File::BOM)', 'my_file.txt');

           open(HANDLE, '&gt;:encoding(UTF-16LE):via(File::BOM)', 'out_file.txt');
           print "foo\n"; # BOM is written to file here

       This method is less prone to errors on non-seekable files as spillage is incorporated  into  an  internal
       buffer, but it doesn't give you any information about the encoding being used, or indeed whether or not a
       BOM was present.

       There  are a few known problems with this interface, especially surrounding <b>seek()</b> and <b>tell()</b>, please see
       the BUGS section for more details about this.

   <b>Reading</b>
       The via(File::BOM) layer must be added before the handle is read from, otherwise any BOM will be  missed.
       If there is no BOM, no decoding will be done.

       Because  of  a limitation in PerlIO::via, <b>read()</b> always works on bytes, not characters. BOM decoding will
       still be done but output will be bytes of UTF-8.

           open(BOM, '&lt;:via(File::BOM)', $file);
           $bytes_read = read(BOM, $buffer, $length);
           $unicode = decode('UTF-8', $buffer, Encode::FB_QUIET);

           # Now $unicode is valid unicode and $buffer contains any left-over bytes

   <b>Writing</b>
       Add the via(File::BOM) layer on top of a unicode encoding layer to print a BOM at the start of the output
       file. This needs to be done before any data is written. The BOM is written as part  of  the  first  print
       command on the handle, so if you don't print anything to the handle, you won't get a BOM.

       There is a "Wide character in print" warning generated when the via(File::BOM) layer doesn't receive utf8
       on  writing. This glitch was resolved in perl version 5.8.7, but if your perl version is older than that,
       you'll need to make sure that the via(File::BOM) layer receives utf8 like this:

           # This works OK
           open(FH, '&gt;:encoding(UTF-16LE):via(File::BOM):utf8', $filename)

           # This generates warnings with older perls
           open(FH, '&gt;:encoding(UTF-16LE):via(File::BOM)', $filename)

   <b>Seeking</b>
       Seeking with SEEK_SET results in an offset equal to the length of any detected BOM being applied  to  the
       position parameter. Thus:

           # Seek to end of BOM (not start of file!)
           seek(FILE_BOM_HANDLE, 0, SEEK_SET)

   <b>Telling</b>
       In order to work correctly with <b>seek()</b>, <b>tell()</b> also returns a postion adjusted by the length of the BOM.

           context.

       •   Couldn't read from handle: $!

           <b>_get_encoding_seekable()</b>   couldn't   read   the   handle.   This    function    is    called    from
           <b>get_encoding_from_filehandle()</b>, <b>defuse()</b> and <b>open_bom()</b>

       •   Couldn't reset read position: $!

           _get_encoding_seekable couldn't seek to the position after the BOM.

       •   Couldn't read byte: $!

           get_encoding_from_stream   couldn't   read   from   the   handle.   This   function  is  called  from
           <b>get_encoding_from_filehandle()</b> and <b>open_bom()</b> when the handle or file is unseekable.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Older versions of PerlIO::via have a few problems with writing, see above.

       The current version of PerlIO::via has limitations with regard to seek and tell, currently only line-wise
       seek and tell are supported by this module. If <b>read()</b> is used to read partial lines,  <b>tell()</b>  will  still
       give the position of the end of the last line read.

       Under windows, <b>tell()</b> seems to return erroneously when reading files with unix line endings.

       Under  windows,  warnings  may  be  generated  when  using the PerlIO::via interface to read UTF-16LE and
       UTF-32LE encoded files. This seems to be a bug in the relevant encoding(...) layers.
