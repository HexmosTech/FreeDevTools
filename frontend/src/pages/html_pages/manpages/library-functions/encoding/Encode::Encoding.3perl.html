</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Encode::Encoding - Encode Implementation Base Class

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package Encode::MyEncoding;
         use parent qw(Encode::Encoding);

         __PACKAGE__-&gt;Define(qw(myCanonical myAlias));

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       As mentioned in Encode, encodings are (in the current implementation at least) defined as objects. The
       mapping of encoding name to object is via the %Encode::Encoding hash.  Though you can directly manipulate
       this hash, it is strongly encouraged to use this base class module and add <b>encode()</b> and <b>decode()</b> methods.

   <b>Methods</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>implement</b>
       You are strongly encouraged to implement methods below, at least either <b>encode()</b> or <b>decode()</b>.

       -&gt;encode($string [,$check])
           MUST return the octet sequence representing <u>$string</u>.

           • If  <u>$check</u> is true, it SHOULD modify <u>$string</u> in place to remove the converted part (i.e.  the whole
             string unless there is an error).  If <b>perlio_ok()</b> is true, SHOULD becomes MUST.

           • If an error occurs, it SHOULD return the octet sequence for the fragment of string  that  has  been
             converted  and  modify  $string  in-place to remove the converted part leaving it starting with the
             problem fragment.  If <b>perlio_ok()</b> is true, SHOULD becomes MUST.

           • If <u>$check</u> is false then "encode" MUST  make a "best effort" to convert the string - for example, by
             using a replacement character.

       -&gt;decode($octets [,$check])
           MUST return the string that <u>$octets</u> represents.

           • If <u>$check</u> is true, it SHOULD modify <u>$octets</u> in place to remove the converted part (i.e.  the  whole
             sequence unless there is an error).  If <b>perlio_ok()</b> is true, SHOULD becomes MUST.

           • If  an  error  occurs,  it  SHOULD return the fragment of string that has been converted and modify
             $octets in-place to remove the converted part leaving it starting with the  problem  fragment.   If
             <b>perlio_ok()</b> is true, SHOULD becomes MUST.

           • If <u>$check</u> is false then "decode" should make a "best effort" to convert the string - for example by
             using Unicode's "\x{FFFD}" as a replacement character.

       If you want your encoding to work with encoding pragma, you should also implement the method below.

       -&gt;cat_decode($destination, $octets, $offset, $terminator [,$check])
           MUST  decode  <u>$octets</u>  with <u>$offset</u> and concatenate it to <u>$destination</u>.  Decoding will terminate when
           $terminator (a string) appears in output.  <u>$offset</u> will be modified to the last $octets  position  at
           end of decode.  Returns true if $terminator appears output, else returns false.

   <b>Other</b> <b>methods</b> <b>defined</b> <b>in</b> <b>Encode::Encodings</b>
       You do not have to override methods shown below unless you have to.

       -&gt;name
           Predefined As:

             sub name  { return shift-&gt;{'Name'} }

           MUST return the string representing the canonical name of the encoding.

       -&gt;mime_name
           Predefined As:

             sub mime_name{
               return Encode::MIME::Name::get_mime_name(shift-&gt;name);
             }

           MUST return the string representing the IANA charset name of the encoding.

       -&gt;renew
           Predefined As:

             sub renew {
               my $self = shift;
               my $clone = bless { %$self } =&gt; ref($self);
               $clone-&gt;{renewed}++;
               return $clone;
             }

           This  method  reconstructs  the  encoding object if necessary.  If you need to store the state during
           encoding, this is where you clone your object.

           PerlIO ALWAYS calls this method to make sure it has its own private encoding object.

       -&gt;renewed
           Predefined As:

             sub renewed { $_[0]-&gt;{renewed} || 0 }

           Tells whether the object is renewed (and how many times).  Some modules emit  "Use  of  uninitialized
           value in null operation" warning unless the value is numeric so return 0 for false.

       -&gt;<b>perlio_ok()</b>
           Predefined As:

             sub perlio_ok {
               return eval { require PerlIO::encoding } ? 1 : 0;
             }

           If your encoding does not support PerlIO for some reasons, just;

            sub perlio_ok { 0 }

       -&gt;<b>needs_lines()</b>
           Predefined As:

             sub needs_lines { 0 };

           If  your  encoding  can  work with PerlIO but needs line buffering, you MUST define this method so it
           returns true.  7bit ISO-2022 encodings are one example that needs this.  When this method is missing,
           false is assumed.

   <b>Example:</b> <b>Encode::ROT13</b>
         package Encode::ROT13;
         use strict;
         use parent qw(Encode::Encoding);

         __PACKAGE__-&gt;Define('rot13');

         sub encode($$;$){
             my ($obj, $str, $chk) = @_;
             $str =~ tr/A-Za-z/N-ZA-Mn-za-m/;
             $_[1] = '' if $chk; # this is what in-place edit means
             return $str;
         }

         # Jr pna or ynml yvxr guvf;
         *decode = \&amp;encode;

         1;

</pre><h4><b>Why</b> <b>the</b> <b>heck</b> <b>Encode</b> <b>API</b> <b>is</b> <b>different?</b></h4><pre>
       It should be noted that the <u>$check</u> behaviour is different from the outer public API. The  logic  is  that
       the  "unchecked" case is useful when the encoding is part of a stream which may be reporting errors (e.g.
       STDERR).  In such cases, it is desirable to get everything through  somehow  without  causing  additional
       errors  which  obscure  the  original  one.  Also,  the  encoding is best placed to know what the correct
       replacement character is, so if that is the desired behaviour then letting low level code do  it  is  the
       most efficient.

       By contrast, if <u>$check</u> is true, the scheme above allows the encoding to do as much as it can and tell the
       layer  above  how much that was. What is lacking at present is a mechanism to report what went wrong. The
       most likely interface will be an additional method call to the object, or perhaps (to avoid forcing  per-
       stream objects on otherwise stateless encodings) an additional parameter.

       It  is  also highly desirable that encoding classes inherit from "Encode::Encoding" as a base class. This
       allows that class to define additional behaviour for all encoding objects.

         package Encode::MyEncoding;
         use parent qw(Encode::Encoding);

         __PACKAGE__-&gt;Define(qw(myCanonical myAlias));

       to create an object with "bless {Name =&gt; ...}, $class", and call  define_encoding.   They  inherit  their
       "name" method from "Encode::Encoding".

   <b>Compiled</b> <b>Encodings</b>
       For  the  sake  of  speed and efficiency, most of the encodings are now supported via a <u>compiled</u> <u>form</u>: XS
       modules generated from UCM files.   Encode provides the enc2xs tool to achieve that.  Please  see  enc2xs
       for more details.
