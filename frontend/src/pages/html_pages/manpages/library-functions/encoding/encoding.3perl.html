       encoding - allows you to write your script in non-ASCII and non-UTF-8

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       This module has been deprecated since perl v5.18.  See "DESCRIPTION" and "BUGS".

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use encoding "greek";  # Perl like Greek to you?
         use encoding "euc-jp"; # Jperl!

         # or you can even do this if your shell supports your native encoding

         perl -Mencoding=latin2 -e'...' # Feeling centrally European?
         perl -Mencoding=euc-kr -e'...' # Or Korean?

         # more control

         # A simple euc-cn =&gt; utf-8 converter
         use encoding "euc-cn", STDOUT =&gt; "utf8";  while(&lt;&gt;){print};

         # "no encoding;" supported
         no encoding;

         # an alternate way, Filter
         use encoding "euc-jp", Filter=&gt;1;
         # now you can use kanji identifiers -- in euc-jp!

         # encode based on the current locale - specialized purposes only;
         # fraught with danger!!
         use encoding ':locale';

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This pragma is used to enable a Perl script to be written in encodings that aren't strictly ASCII nor
       UTF-8.  It translates all or portions of the Perl program script from a given encoding into UTF-8, and
       changes the PerlIO layers of "STDIN" and "STDOUT" to the encoding specified.

       This pragma dates from the days when UTF-8-enabled editors were uncommon.  But that was long ago, and the
       need for it is greatly diminished.  That, coupled with the fact that it doesn't work with threads, along
       with other problems, (see "BUGS") have led to its being deprecated.  It is planned to remove this pragma
       in a future Perl version.  New code should be written in UTF-8, and the "use utf8" pragma used instead
       (see perluniintro and utf8 for details).  Old code should be converted to UTF-8, via something like the
       recipe in the "SYNOPSIS" (though this simple approach may require manual adjustments afterwards).

       If UTF-8 is not an option, it is recommended that one use a simple source filter, such as that provided
       by Filter::Encoding on CPAN or this pragma's own "Filter" option (see below).

       The only legitimate use of this pragma is almost certainly just one per file, near the top, with file
       scope, as the file is likely going to only be written in one encoding.  Further restrictions apply in
       Perls before v5.22 (see "Prior to Perl v5.22").

       There are two basic modes of operation (plus turning if off):

       "use encoding ['<u>ENCNAME</u>'] ;"
           Please note: This mode of operation is no longer supported as of Perl v5.26.

           This  is  the  normal  operation.  It translates various literals encountered in the Perl source file
           from the encoding <u>ENCNAME</u> into UTF-8, and similarly converts character code  points.   This  is  used
           when  the  script  is  a  combination of ASCII (for the variable names and punctuation, <u>etc</u>), but the
           literal data is in the specified encoding.

           <u>ENCNAME</u> is optional.  If omitted, the encoding specified in the environment variable  "PERL_ENCODING"
           is used.  If this isn't set, or the resolved-to encoding is not known to "Encode", the error "Unknown
           encoding '<u>ENCNAME</u>'" will be thrown.

           Starting  in  Perl  v5.8.6  ("Encode" version 2.0.1), <u>ENCNAME</u> may be the name ":locale".  This is for
           very specialized applications, and is documented in "The ":locale" sub-pragma" below.

           The literals that are converted are "q//, qq//, qr//, qw///, qx//", and starting in v5.8.1,  "tr///".
           Operations that do conversions include "chr", "ord", "utf8::upgrade" (but not "utf8::downgrade"), and
           "chomp".

           Also starting in v5.8.1, the "DATA" pseudo-filehandle is translated from the encoding into UTF-8.

           For example, you can write code in EUC-JP as follows:

             my $Rakuda = "\xF1\xD1\xF1\xCC"; # Camel in Kanji
                          #&lt;-char-&gt;&lt;-char-&gt;   # 4 octets
             s/\bCamel\b/$Rakuda/;

           And with "use encoding "euc-jp"" in effect, it is the same thing as that code in UTF-8:

             my $Rakuda = "\x{99F1}\x{99DD}"; # two Unicode Characters
             s/\bCamel\b/$Rakuda/;

           See "EXAMPLE" below for a more complete example.

           Unless  "${^UNICODE}"  (available  starting  in  v5.8.2) exists and is non-zero, the PerlIO layers of
           "STDIN" and "STDOUT" are set to ":encoding(<u>ENCNAME</u>)".  Therefore,

             use encoding "euc-jp";
             my $message = "Camel is the symbol of perl.\n";
             my $Rakuda = "\xF1\xD1\xF1\xCC"; # Camel in Kanji
             $message =~ s/\bCamel\b/$Rakuda/;
             print $message;

           will print

            "\xF1\xD1\xF1\xCC is the symbol of perl.\n"

           not

            "\x{99F1}\x{99DD} is the symbol of perl.\n"

           You can override this by giving extra arguments; see below.

           Note that "STDERR" WILL NOT be changed, regardless.

           Also note that non-STD file handles remain unaffected.  Use "use open" or  "binmode"  to  change  the
           layers of those.

       "use encoding <u>ENCNAME</u>, Filter=&gt;1;"
           This operates as above, but the "Filter" argument with a non-zero value causes the entire script, and
           not  just  literals,  to  be translated from the encoding into UTF-8.  This allows identifiers in the
           source to be in that encoding as well.  (Problems may occur if the encoding  is  not  a  superset  of
           ASCII;  imagine  all  your  semi-colons being translated into something different.)  One can use this
           form to make

            ${"\x{4eba}"}++

           work.  (This is equivalent to "$<u>human</u>++", where <u>human</u> is a single Han ideograph).

           This effectively means that your source code behaves as if it were written in UTF-8 with "'use utf8"'
           in effect.  So even if your editor only supports Shift_JIS, for example, you can still  try  examples
           in Chapter 15 of "Programming Perl, 3rd Ed.".

           This option is significantly slower than the other one.

       "no encoding;"
           Unsets  the  script  encoding.  The  layers  of  "STDIN", "STDOUT" are reset to "":raw"" (the default
           unprocessed raw stream of bytes).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Setting</b> <b>"STDIN"</b> <b>and/or</b> <b>"STDOUT"</b> <b>individually</b>
       The encodings of "STDIN" and "STDOUT" are individually settable by parameters to the pragma:

        use encoding 'euc-tw', STDIN =&gt; 'greek'  ...;

       In this case, you cannot omit the first <u>ENCNAME</u>.  "STDIN =&gt; undef" turns the I/O  transcoding  completely
       off for that filehandle.

       When  "${^UNICODE}"  (available  starting  in  v5.8.2)  exists  and  is  non-zero,  these options will be
       completely ignored.  See ""${^UNICODE}"" in perlvar and ""-C"" in perlrun for details.

   <b>The</b> <b>":locale"</b> <b>sub-pragma</b>
       Starting in v5.8.6, the encoding name may be ":locale".  This means that the encoding is taken  from  the
       current  locale,  and not hard-coded by the pragma.  Since a script really can only be encoded in exactly
       one encoding, this option is dangerous.  It makes sense only if the script itself is  written  in  ASCII,
       and  all  the  possible  locales  that will be in use when the script is executed are supersets of ASCII.
       That means that the script itself doesn't get changed, but the I/O handles have  the  specified  encoding
       added, and the operations like "chr" and "ord" use that encoding.

       The logic of finding which locale ":locale" uses is as follows:

       1.  If the platform supports the langinfo(CODESET) interface, the codeset returned is used as the default
           encoding for the open pragma.

       2.  If  1.  didn't work but we are under the locale pragma, the environment variables "LC_ALL" and "LANG"
           (in that order) are matched for encodings (the part after ""."", if any), and if any found,  that  is
           used as the default encoding for the open pragma.

       3.  If  1.  and 2. didn't work, the environment variables "LC_ALL" and "LANG" (in that order) are matched
           for anything looking like UTF-8, and if any found, ":utf8" is used as the default  encoding  for  the
           open pragma.

       If your locale environment variables ("LC_ALL", "LC_CTYPE", "LANG") contain the strings 'UTF-8' or 'UTF8'
       (case-insensitive  matching),  the  default  encoding of your "STDIN", "STDOUT", and "STDERR", and of <b>any</b>
       <b>subsequent</b> <b>file</b> <b>open</b>, is UTF-8.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>SIDE</b> <b>EFFECTS</b>
       â€¢   If the "encoding" pragma is in scope then the lengths returned are calculated from the length  of  $/
           in Unicode characters, which is not always the same as the length of $/ in the native encoding.

       â€¢   Without  this  pragma,  if  strings operating under byte semantics and strings with Unicode character
           data are concatenated, the new string will be created by decoding the  byte  strings  as  <u>ISO</u>  <u>8859-1</u>
           <u>(Latin-1)</u>.

           The <b>encoding</b> pragma changes this to use the specified encoding instead.  For example:

               use encoding 'utf8';
               my $string = <a href="../man20000/chr.20000.html">chr</a>(20000); # a Unicode string
               utf8::encode($string);   # now it's a UTF-8 encoded byte string
               # concatenate with another Unicode string
               print length($string . <a href="../man20000/chr.20000.html">chr</a>(20000));

           Will  print 2, because $string is upgraded as UTF-8.  Without "use encoding 'utf8';", it will print 4
           instead, since $string is three octets when interpreted as Latin-1.

   <b>DO</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>MIX</b> <b>MULTIPLE</b> <b>ENCODINGS</b>
       Notice that only literals (string or regular expression) having only legacy code points are affected:  if
       you mix data like this

           \x{100}\xDF
           \xDF\x{100}

       the  data  is  assumed to be in (Latin 1 and) Unicode, not in your native encoding.  In other words, this
       will match in "greek":

           "\xDF" =~ /\x{3af}/

       but this will not

           "\xDF\x{100}" =~ /\x{3af}\x{100}/

       since the "\xDF" (ISO 8859-7 GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH TONOS) on the left  will  <b>not</b>  be  upgraded  to
       "\x{3af}"  (Unicode GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH TONOS) because of the "\x{100}" on the left.  You should
       not be mixing your legacy data and Unicode in the same string.

       This pragma also affects encoding of the 0x80..0xFF code point range: normally characters in  that  range
       are  left  as eight-bit bytes (unless they are combined with characters with code points 0x100 or larger,
       in which case all characters need to become UTF-8 encoded), but if the "encoding" pragma is present, even
       the 0x80..0xFF range always gets UTF-8 encoded.

       After all, the best thing about this pragma is that you don't have to resort to \x{....}  just  to  spell
       your name in a native encoding.  So feel free to put your strings in your encoding in quotes and regexes.

   <b>Prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>v5.22</b>
       The  pragma  was  a  per  script, not a per block lexical.  Only the last "use encoding" or "no encoding"
       mattered, and it affected <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>script</b>.  However, the "no encoding" pragma  was  supported  and  "use
       encoding" could appear as many times as you want in a given script (though only the last was effective).

       Since  the  scope wasn't lexical, other modules' use of "chr", "ord", <u>etc.</u>  were affected.  This leads to
       spooky, incorrect action at a distance that is hard to debug.

       This means you would have to be very careful of the load order:

         # called module
         package Module_IN_BAR;
         use encoding "bar";
         # stuff in "bar" encoding here
         1;

         # caller script
         use encoding "foo"
         use Module_IN_BAR;
         # surprise! use encoding "bar" is in effect.

       The best way to avoid this oddity is to use this pragma RIGHT AFTER other modules are loaded.  i.e.

         use Module_IN_BAR;
         use encoding "foo";

   <b>Prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>Encode</b> <b>version</b> <b>1.87</b>
       â€¢   "STDIN"  and  "STDOUT"  were  not  set  under  the  filter   option.    And   "STDIN=&gt;<u>ENCODING</u>"   and
           "STDOUT=&gt;<u>ENCODING</u>" didn't work like non-filter version.

       â€¢   "use utf8" wasn't implicitly declared so you have to "use utf8" to do

            ${"\x{4eba}"}++

   <b>Prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>v5.8.1</b>
       "NON-EUC" doublebyte encodings
           Because  perl  needs to parse the script before applying this pragma, such encodings as Shift_JIS and
           Big-5 that may contain '\' (BACKSLASH; "\x5c") in the second byte fail because the  second  byte  may
           accidentally escape the quoting character that follows.

       "tr///"
           The  <b>encoding</b>  pragma  works by decoding string literals in "q//,qq//,qr//,qw///, qx//" and so forth.
           In perl v5.8.0, this does not apply to "tr///".  Therefore,

             use encoding 'euc-jp';
             #....
             $kana =~ tr/\xA4\xA1-\xA4\xF3/\xA5\xA1-\xA5\xF3/;
             #           -------- -------- -------- --------

           Does not work as

             $kana =~ tr/\x{3041}-\x{3093}/\x{30a1}-\x{30f3}/;

           Legend of characters above
                 utf8     euc-jp   charnames::viacode()
                 -----------------------------------------
                 \x{3041} \xA4\xA1 HIRAGANA LETTER SMALL A
                 \x{3093} \xA4\xF3 HIRAGANA LETTER N
                 \x{30a1} \xA5\xA1 KATAKANA LETTER SMALL A
                 \x{30f3} \xA5\xF3 KATAKANA LETTER N

           This counterintuitive behavior has been fixed in perl v5.8.1.

           In perl v5.8.0, you can work around this as follows;

             use encoding 'euc-jp';
             #  ....
             eval qq{ \$kana =~ tr/\xA4\xA1-\xA4\xF3/\xA5\xA1-\xA5\xF3/ };

           Note the "tr//" expression is surrounded by "qq{}".  The idea behind this is the same as the  classic
           idiom that makes "tr///" 'interpolate':

              tr/$from/$to/;            # wrong!
              eval qq{ tr/$from/$to/ }; # workaround.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b> <b>-</b> <b>Greekperl</b></h4><pre>
           use encoding "iso 8859-7";

           # \xDF in ISO 8859-7 (Greek) is \x{3af} in Unicode.

           $a = "\xDF";
           $b = "\x{100}";

           printf "%#x\n", ord($a); # will print 0x3af, not 0xdf

           $c = $a . $b;

           # $c will be "\x{3af}\x{100}", not "\x{df}\x{100}".

           # chr() is affected, and ...

           print "mega\n"  if ord(<a href="../man0xdf/chr.0xdf.html">chr</a>(0xdf)) == 0x3af;

           # ... ord() is affected by the encoding pragma ...

           print "tera\n" if ord(pack("C", 0xdf)) == 0x3af;

           # ... as are eq and cmp ...

           print "peta\n" if "\x{3af}" eq  pack("C", 0xdf);
           print "exa\n"  if "\x{3af}" cmp pack("C", 0xdf) == 0;

           # ... but pack/unpack C are not affected, in case you still
           # want to go back to your native encoding

           print "zetta\n" if unpack("C", (pack("C", 0xdf))) == 0xdf;

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Thread safety
           "use encoding ..." is not thread-safe (i.e., do not use in threaded applications).

       Can't be used by more than one module in a single program.
           Only  one  encoding  is  allowed.  If you combine modules in a program that have different encodings,
           only one will be actually used.

       Other modules using "STDIN" and "STDOUT" get the encoded stream
           They may be expecting something completely different.

       literals in regex that are longer than 127 bytes
           For native multibyte encodings (either fixed or variable length), the current implementation  of  the
           regular  expressions  may  introduce  recoding errors for regular expression literals longer than 127
           bytes.

       EBCDIC
           The encoding pragma is not supported on EBCDIC platforms.

       "format"
           This pragma doesn't work well with "format" because PerlIO does not get  along  very  well  with  it.
           When  "format"  contains  non-ASCII characters it prints funny or gets "wide character warnings".  To
           understand it, try the code below.

             # Save this one in utf8
             # replace *non-ascii* with a non-ascii string
             my $camel;
             format STDOUT =
             *non-ascii*@&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
             $camel
             .
             $camel = "*non-ascii*";
             binmode(STDOUT=&gt;':encoding(utf8)'); # bang!
             write;              # funny
             print $camel, "\n"; # fine

           Without binmode this happens to work but without binmode, <b>print()</b> fails instead of <b>write()</b>.

           At any rate, the very use of "format" is questionable when it comes to unicode characters  since  you
           have  to  consider  such  things as character width (i.e. double-width for ideographs) and directions
           (i.e. BIDI for Arabic and Hebrew).
