       Encode::Unicode::UTF7 -- UTF-7 encoding

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Encode qw/encode decode/;
           $utf7 = encode("UTF-7", $utf8);
           $utf8 = decode("UTF-7", $ucs2);

</pre><h4><b>ABSTRACT</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements UTF-7 encoding documented in RFC 2152.  UTF-7, as its name suggests, is a 7-bit
       re-encoded version of UTF-16BE.  It is designed to be MTA-safe and expected to be a standard way to
       exchange Unicoded mails via mails.  But with the advent of UTF-8 and 8-bit compliant MTAs, UTF-7 is
       hardly ever used.

       UTF-7 was not supported by Encode until version 1.95 because of that.  But Unicode::String, a module by
       Gisle Aas which adds Unicode supports to non-utf8-savvy perl did support UTF-7, the UTF-7 support was
       added so Encode can supersede Unicode::String 100%.

</pre><h4><b>In</b> <b>Practice</b></h4><pre>
       When you want to encode Unicode for mails and web pages, however, do not use UTF-7 unless you are sure
       your recipients and readers can handle it.  Very few MUAs and WWW Browsers support these days (only
       Mozilla seems to support one).  For general cases, use UTF-8 for message body and MIME-Header for header
       instead.
