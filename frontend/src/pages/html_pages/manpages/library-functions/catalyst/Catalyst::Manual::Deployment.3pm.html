       Catalyst::Manual::Deployment - Deploying Catalyst

</pre><h4><b>DEPLOYMENT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Catalyst applications are most often deployed as a FastCGI or mod_perl application (with FastCGI being
       the recommended option). However, as Catalyst is based on the PSGI specification, any web handler
       implementing that specification can be used to run Catalyst applications.

       This documentation most thoroughly covers the normal and traditional deployment options, but will mention
       alternate methods of deployment, and we welcome additional documentation from people deploying Catalyst
       in non-standard environments.

   <b>Deployment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shared</b> <b>hosting</b> <b>environment</b>
       Almost all shared hosting environments involve deploying Catalyst as a FastCGI application on Apache. You
       will usually want to have a set of libraries specific to your application installed on your shared host.

       Full details of deploying Catalyst in a shared hosting environment are at
       Catalyst::Manual::Deployment::SharedHosting.

   <b>FastCGI</b>
       FastCGI is the most common Catalyst deployment option. It is documented generally in
       Catalyst::Manual::Deployment::FastCGI, and there are specific instructions for using FastCGI with common
       web servers below:

       <u>Apache</u>

       Catalyst::Manual::Deployment::Apache::FastCGI

       <u>nginx</u>

       Catalyst::Manual::Deployment::nginx::FastCGI

       <u>lighttpd</u>

       Catalyst::Manual::Deployment::lighttpd::FastCGI

       <u>Microsoft</u> <u>IIS</u>

       Catalyst::Manual::Deployment::IIS::FastCGI

   <b>mod_perl</b>
       Traditionally a common deployment option for dedicated applications, mod_perl has some advantages and
       disadvantages over FastCGI. Use of mod_perl is documented in
       Catalyst::Manual::Deployment::Apache::mod_perl.

   <b>Development</b> <b>Server</b>
       It is possible to deploy the Catalyst development server behind a reverse proxy. This may work well for
       small-scale applications which are in an early development phase, but which you want to be able to show
       to people. See Catalyst::Manual::Deployment::DevelopmentServer.

   <b>PSGI</b>
       Catalyst can be deployed with any PSGI-compliant handler. See Catalyst::PSGI for more information; a list
       of possible deployment servers are shown below:

       <u>NGINX</u> <u>Unit</u>

       NGINX Unit &lt;https://unit.nginx.org&gt; is a lightweight, dynamically configurable web app server that
       supports running PSGI-capable apps.

       <u>Starman</u>

       Starman is a high-performance Perl server implementation, which is designed to be used directly (rather
       than behind a reverse proxy). It includes HTTP/1.1 support, chunked requests and responses, keep-alive,
       and pipeline requests.

       <u>Starlet</u>

       Starlet is a standalone HTTP/1.0 server with keep‚Äêalive support which is suitable for running HTTP
       application servers behind a reverse proxy.

       <u>Twiggy</u>

       Twiggy is a high-performance asynchronous web server. It can be used in conjunction with Catalyst, but
       there are a number of caveats which mean that it is not suitable for most deployments.

   <b>Chef</b>
       Chef &lt;https://www.chef.io/products/chef-infra/&gt; is an open-source systems integration framework built
       specifically for automating cloud computing deployments. A Cookbooks demonstrating how to deploy a
       Catalyst application using Chef is available at &lt;https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/catalyst&gt; and
       &lt;https://github.com/melezhik/cookbooks/wiki/Catalyst-cookbook-intro&gt;.
