</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Catalyst::Helper - Bootstrap a Catalyst application

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         catalyst.pl &lt;myappname&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is used by <b>catalyst.pl</b> to create a set of scripts for a new catalyst application. The scripts
       each contain documentation and will output help on how to use them if called incorrectly or in some
       cases, with no arguments.

       It also provides some useful methods for a Helper module to call when creating a component. See
       "METHODS".

</pre><h4><b>SCRIPTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>_create.pl</b>
       Used to create new components for a catalyst application at the development stage.

   <b>_server.pl</b>
       The catalyst test server, starts an HTTPD which outputs debugging to the terminal.

   <b>_test.pl</b>
       A script for running tests from the command-line.

   <b>_cgi.pl</b>
       Run your application as a CGI.

   <b>_fastcgi.pl</b>
       Run the application as a fastcgi app. Either by hand, or call this from FastCgiServer in your http server
       config.

</pre><h4><b>HELPERS</b></h4><pre>
       The "_create.pl" script creates application components using Helper modules. The Catalyst team provides a
       good number of Helper modules for you to use. You can also add your own.

       Helpers are classes that provide two methods.

           * mk_compclass - creates the Component class
           * mk_comptest  - creates the Component test

       So when you call "scripts/myapp_create.pl view MyView TT", create will try to execute
       Catalyst::Helper::View::TT-&gt;mk_compclass and Catalyst::Helper::View::TT-&gt;mk_comptest.

       See Catalyst::Helper::View::TT and Catalyst::Helper::Model::DBIC::Schema for examples.

       All helper classes should be under one of the following namespaces.

           Catalyst::Helper::Model::
           Catalyst::Helper::View::
           Catalyst::Helper::Controller::

   <b>COMMON</b> <b>HELPERS</b>
       •   Catalyst::Helper::Model::DBIC::Schema - DBIx::Class models

       •   Catalyst::Helper::View::TT - Template Toolkit view

       •   Catalyst::Helper::Model::LDAP

       •   Catalyst::Helper::Model::Adaptor - wrap any class into a Catalyst model

       <u>NOTE</u>

       The  helpers  will  read  author name from <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> by default.  To override, please export the AUTHOR
       variable.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>mk_compclass</b>
       This method in your Helper module is  called  with  $helper  which  is  a  Catalyst::Helper  object,  and
       whichever  other  arguments  the  user added to the command-line. You can use the $helper to call methods
       described below.

       If the  Helper  module  does  not  contain  a  "mk_compclass"  method,  it  will  fall  back  to  calling
       "render_file", with an argument of "compclass".

   <b>mk_comptest</b>
       This  method  in  your  Helper  module  is  called  with  $helper which is a Catalyst::Helper object, and
       whichever other arguments the user added to the command-line. You can use the  $helper  to  call  methods
       described below.

       If  the  Helper  module  does  not  contain  a  "mk_compclass"  method,  it  will  fall  back  to calling
       "render_file", with an argument of "comptest".

   <b>mk_stuff</b>
       This method is called if the user does not supply any of the usual component types "view",  "controller",
       "model".  It  is passed the $helper object (an instance of Catalyst::Helper), and any other arguments the
       user typed.

       There is no fallback for this method.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       These are the methods that the Helper classes can call on the &lt;$helper&gt; object passed to them.

   <b>render_file</b> <b>($file,</b> <b>$path,</b> <b>$vars,</b> <b>$perms)</b>
       Render and create a file from a template in DATA using Template Toolkit. $file is the relevant  chunk  of
       the __DATA__ section, $path is the path to the file, $vars is the hashref as expected by Template Toolkit
       and $perms are desired permissions (or system defaults if not set).

   <b>get_file</b> <b>($class,</b> <b>$file)</b>
       Fetch  file contents from the DATA section. This is used internally by "render_file".  $class is the name
       of the class to get the DATA section from.  __PACKAGE__ or ( <b><a href="../man0/caller.0.html">caller</a></b>(0) )[0] might be sensible values  for
       this.

   <b>mk_app</b>
       Create the main application skeleton. This is called by catalyst.pl.

   <b>mk_component</b> <b>($app)</b>
       This method is called by create.pl to make new components for your application.

   <b>mk_dir</b> <b>($path)</b>
       Surprisingly, this function makes a directory.

   <b>mk_file</b> <b>($file,</b> <b>$content)</b>
       Writes content to a file. Called by "render_file".

   <b>next_test</b> <b>($test_name)</b>
       Calculates  the  name  of  the  next  numbered test file and returns it.  Don't give the number or the .t
       suffix for the test name.

   <b>get_sharedir_file</b>
       Method for getting a file out of share/

   <b>render_file_contents</b>
       Process a Template::Toolkit template.

   <b>render_sharedir_file</b>
       Render a template/image file from our share directory

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       The helpers will read author name from <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> by default.  To override,  please  export  the  AUTHOR
       variable.
