       Catalyst::Manual::CatalystAndMoose - How Catalyst 5.8+ and Moose relate

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Since version 5.8, the core of Catalyst is based on Moose. Although the developers went through great
       lengths to allow for a seamless transition, there are still a few things to keep in mind when trying to
       exploit the power of Moose in your Catalyst application.

       This document provides you with a short overview of common caveats and best practices for using
       Moose-based classes within Catalyst.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>CONTEXT</b> <b>CLASS</b></h4><pre>
       A Moose-ified version of the context class should look like this:

           package MyApp;
           use Moose;
           use namespace::autoclean;
           use Catalyst (
               # your roles and plugins
           );
           extends 'Catalyst';

           # If you want to use method modifiers to adjust the setup process, (e.g. setup_finalize)
           # they must be here, before the call to setup (advanced users only)

           $app-&gt;config( name =&gt; 'MyApp' );
           $app-&gt;setup;

           # method modifiers generally must be created after setup because otherwise they will
           # conflict with plugin overrides

           after 'finalize' =&gt; sub {
               my $c = shift;
               $c-&gt;log-&gt;info( 'done!' );
           }

       You should also be aware that roles in "$c-&gt;setup" are applied after the last plugin with all the
       benefits of using a single <b>with()</b> statement in an ordinary Moose class.

       Your class is automatically made immutable at the end of the current file.

       CAVEAT: Using roles in "$c-&gt;setup" was implemented in Catalyst version 5.80004. In prior versions you
       might get away with

           after 'setup_plugins' =&gt; sub{ with(
               # your roles
           )};

           $app-&gt;setup(
               # your plugins
           );

       but this is discouraged and you should upgrade to 5.80004 anyway, because it fixes a few important
       regressions against 5.71

       CAVEAT: Using roles in "$c-&gt;setup" will not currently allow you to pass parameters to roles, or perform
       conflict resolution.  Conflict detection still works as expected.

   <b>ACCESSORS</b>
       Most of the request-specific attributes like "$c-&gt;stash", "$c-&gt;request" and "$c-&gt;response" have been
       converted to Moose attributes but without type constraints, attribute helpers or builder methods. This
       ensures that Catalyst 5.8 is fully backwards compatible to applications using the published API of
       Catalyst 5.7 but slightly limits the gains that could be had by wielding the full power of Moose
       attributes.

       Most of the accessors to information gathered during compile time (such as configuration) are managed by
       Catalyst::ClassData, which is a Moose-aware version of Class::Data::Inheritable but not compatible with
       MooseX::ClassAttribute.

   <b>ROLES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>METHOD</b> <b>MODIFIERS</b>
       Since the release of Catalyst version 5.8, the only reason for creating a Catalyst extension as a plugin
       is to provide backward compatibility to applications still using version 5.7.

       If backward compatibility is of no concern to you, you could as easily rewrite your plugins as roles and
       enjoy all the benefits of automatic method re-dispatching of "before" and "after" method modifiers,
       naming conflict detection and generally cleaner code.

       <u>NOTE</u>

       Plugins and roles should never use

           after 'setup' =&gt; sub { ... } # wrong

       (or any other method of hooking the setup method) but rely on

           after 'setup_finalize' =&gt; sub { ... } # this will work

       to run their own setup code if needed. If they need to influence the setup process itself, they can
       modify setup_dispatcher(), setup_engine(), setup_stats(), setup_components() and setup_actions(), but
       this should be done with due consideration and as late as possible.

</pre><h4><b>CONTROLLERS</b></h4><pre>
       To activate Catalyst's action attributes, Moose-ified controller classes need to extend
       Catalyst::Controller at compile time, before the actions themselves are declared:

             package Catalyst::Controller::Root;
             use Moose;
             use namespace::autoclean;

             BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller'; }

   <b>Controller</b> <b>Roles</b>
       It is possible to use roles to apply method modifiers on controller actions from 5.80003 onwards, or use
       modifiers in your controller classes themselves. For example

           package MyApp::Controller::Foo;
           use Moose;
           use namespace::autoclean;
           BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller' };

           sub foo : Local {
               my ($self, $c) = @_;
               $c-&gt;res-&gt;body('Hello ');
           }
           after foo =&gt; sub {
               my ($self, $c) = @_;
               $c-&gt;res-&gt;body($c-&gt;res-&gt;body . 'World');
           };

       It is possible to have action methods with attributes inside Moose roles, using MooseX::MethodAttributes,
       example:

           package MyApp::ControllerRole;
           use MooseX::MethodAttributes::Role;
           use namespace::autoclean;

           sub foo : Local {
               my ($self, $c) = @_;
               ...
           }

           package MyApp::Controller::Foo;
           use Moose;
           use namespace::autoclean;
           BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller' };

           with 'MyApp::ControllerRole';
