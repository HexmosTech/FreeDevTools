</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Catalyst::Manual::DevelopmentProcess - Administrative structure of the Catalyst Development Process

</pre><h4><b>Contributing</b> <b>to</b> <b>Catalyst</b></h4><pre>
       The main philosophy behind Catalyst development can be summarized as:

           Patches welcome!

       Everyone is welcome (and will be encouraged) to contribute to Catalyst in whatever capacity they're able
       to. People in #catalyst-dev will be more than happy to talk newcomers through contributing their first
       patch, or how best to go about their first CPAN extension module....

</pre><h4><b>Catalyst</b> <b>development</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Discussing</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>bugfixes</b> <b>or</b> <b>improvements</b>
       &lt;<a href="http://wiki.catalystframework.org/wiki/">http://wiki.catalystframework.org/wiki/</a>#Community&gt; has information about how to get in touch with the
       Catalyst "community".  In particular, you would want to discuss a proposed change on the mailing list:

           <a href="http://lists.scsys.co.uk/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/catalyst-dev">http://lists.scsys.co.uk/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/catalyst-dev</a>

       or on IRC:

           irc://irc.perl.org/catalyst-dev
           <a href="http://wiki.catalystframework.org/wiki/livegroups">http://wiki.catalystframework.org/wiki/livegroups</a>

       Usually, the core team will be more than happy for you to contribute, and will talk you through how to
       submit a patch, or get a "commit bit".

   <b>Repositories</b>
       The Catalyst git repository can be found at:

           read: git://git.shadowcat.co.uk/catagits/PROJECTNAME
           write: <a href="mailto:catagits@git.shadowcat.co.uk">catagits@git.shadowcat.co.uk</a>:PROJECTNAME
           browser: https://git.shadowcat.co.uk/gitweb/gitweb.cgi

   <b>Schedule</b>
       There is no dated release cycle for Catalyst. New releases will be made when sufficient small fixes have
       accumulated; or an important bugfix, or significant feature addition, is completed.

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>Catalyst</b> <b>Core</b> <b>Team</b></h4><pre>
       The intention of the Catalyst Core Team is to maintain and support the Catalyst framework, in order for
       it to be a viable and stable framework for developing web-based MVC applications. This includes both
       technical decisions about the Catalyst core distribution, and public relations relating to the Catalyst
       framework as a whole.

       The current goals of the Catalyst core development team are stability, performance, and a properly paced
       addition of features, with a focus on extensibility.

       The core team is concerned with the 'core' Catalyst distributions (i.e. Catalyst::Runtime,
       Catalyst::Devel and Catalyst::Manual), and also tries to encourage best practices for extension authors,
       and cooperation and shared vision within the Catalyst community.

   <b>Membership</b>
       The Catalyst Core Team consists of the developers who have full commit privileges to the entire Catalyst
       source tree, and who have made a significant contribution to the core Catalyst distributions, and various
       extensions and plugins.

       In addition, the core team includes members that have non-technical roles, such as marketing, legal, or
       economic responsibilities.

       Currently, the Core Team consists of the following people:

       Brian Cassidy
       Andy Grundman
       Christian Hansen
       Yuval Kogman
       Marcus Ramberg
       Jonathan Rockway
       Jesse Sheidlower
       Matt S. Trout
       Florian Ragwitz
       Tomas Doran

       New members of the Core Team must be accepted by a 2/3 majority by the current members.

   <b>Technical</b> <b>Decisions.</b>
       Any  change  to  the  Catalyst core which can not be conceived as a correction of an error in the current
       feature set will need to be accepted by at least 3 members of the Core Team before it can be committed to
       master (which is the basis for CPAN releases). Anyone with access is at any time free to make a branch to
       develop a proof of concept for a feature to be committed to master.

   <b>Organizational</b> <b>and</b> <b>Philosophical</b> <b>Decisions.</b>
       Any organizational or philosophical decision should be decided by majority vote. Thus it should be a goal
       of the organization that its membership number should at  any  time  be  an  odd  number,  to  render  it
       effective  with  regards  to decision making. The exceptions to this rule are changes to this charter and
       additions to the membership of the Core Team, which require a 2/3 majority.

   <b>CPAN</b> <b>Releases</b>
       Planned releases to CPAN should be performed by the release  manager,  at  the  time  of  writing  Marcus
       Ramberg,  or  the deputy release manager, at the time of writing Florian Ragwitz. In the case of critical
       error correction, any member of the Core Team can perform a rescue release.

   <b>Public</b> <b>statements</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Core</b> <b>Team</b>
       The Core  Team  should  strive  to  appear  publicly  as  a  group  when  answering  questions  or  other
       correspondence. In cases where this is not possible, the same order as for CPAN releases applies.

   <b>New</b> <b>Catalyst</b> <b>Extensions</b>
       As  Catalyst  is  deliberately  designed for extension, there is an ecosystem of several hundred Catalyst
       extensions that can be found on CPAN.

       See Catalyst::Manual::ExtendingCatalyst for more information on how to extend Catalyst  in  various  ways
       and how to write CPANable components for Catalyst which can be reused in many applications.

       It  is  recommended  to  post  a  request for comments to the Catalyst mailing list, or ask around in the
       #catalyst IRC channel before starting to implement something, as  another  member  of  the  community  is
       likely  to  have example or prototype code that you can reuse, and members of the community and core team
       are happy to advise on the best way to implement a generic solution to a particular problem.

       This could save you duplicate work, and  will  help  you  produce  a  better  thought  out  and  designed
       extension.
