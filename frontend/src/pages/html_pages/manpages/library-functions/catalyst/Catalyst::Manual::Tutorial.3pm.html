       Catalyst::Manual::Tutorial - Catalyst Tutorial: Overview

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Catalyst framework is a flexible and comprehensive environment for quickly building high-
       functionality web applications.  This tutorial is designed to provide a rapid introduction to its basics
       and its most commonly used features while focusing on real-world best practices.

       We suggest that you read this introduction on the web.  Make sure you are reading the latest version of
       the tutorial by visiting Catalyst::Manual::Tutorial.  Alternatively you can use CPAN modules like
       Pod::Webserver, Pod::POM::Web, Pod::Browser (Catalyst based), or CPAN::Mini::Webserver to read a local
       copy of the tutorial.

       The tutorial is divided into the following sections:

</pre><h4><b>THANKS</b></h4><pre>
       This tutorial would not have been possible without the input of many different  people  in  the  Catalyst
       community.  In particular, the primary author would like to thank:

       •   Sebastian Riedel for founding the Catalyst project.

       •   The  members  of  the  Catalyst Core Team for their tireless efforts to advance the Catalyst project.
           Although all of the Core Team members have played a key role in this tutorial, it  would  have  never
           been  possible  without  the critical contributions of: Matt Trout, for his unfathomable knowledge of
           all things Perl and Catalyst (and his willingness to answer lots of my questions); Jesse  Sheidlower,
           for   his  incredible  skill  with  the  written  word  and  dedication  to  improving  the  Catalyst
           documentation; and Yuval Kogman, for his work on the Catalyst "Auth &amp; Authz"  plugins  (the  original
           focus of the tutorial) and other key Catalyst modules.

       •   Other  Catalyst  documentation  folks  like  Kieren Diment, Gavin Henry, and Jess Robinson (including
           their work on the original Catalyst tutorial).

       •   Kieren Diment for his oversight of Catalyst-related documentation.

       •   Everyone on #catalyst and #catalyst-dev.

       •   Louis Moore (who thanks Marcello Romani and Tom Lanyon) for the PostgreSQL content in the Appendix.

       •   People who have emailed me with corrections and suggestions on the tutorial. As of  the  most  recent
           release,  this  include:  Florian  Ragwitz,  Mauro  Andreolini, Jim Howard, Giovanni Gigante, William
           Moreno, Bryan Roach, Ashley Berlin, David Kamholz, Kevin Old, Henning  Sprang,  Jeremy  Jones,  David
           Kurtz,  Ingo  Wichmann,  Shlomi  Fish,  Murray Walker, Adam Witney and xenoterracide (Caleb Cushing).
           Thanks to Devin Austin for coming up with an initial version of a non-TTSite wrapper  page.  Also,  a
           huge  thank  you  to  Kiffin  Gish for all the hard work on the "database depluralization" effort and
           Rafael Kitover for the work on updating the tutorial to include foreign key support for  SQLite.  I'm
           sure  I  am  missing  some names here... apologies for that (please let me know if you name should be
           here).
