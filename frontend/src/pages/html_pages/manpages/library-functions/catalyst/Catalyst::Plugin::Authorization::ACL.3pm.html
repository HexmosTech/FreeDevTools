</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::ACL - ACL support for Catalyst applications.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use Catalyst qw/
                       Authentication
                       Authorization::Roles
                       Authorization::ACL
               /;

               __PACKAGE__-&gt;setup;

               __PACKAGE__-&gt;deny_access_unless(
                       "/foo/bar",
                       [qw/nice_role/],
               );

               __PACKAGE__-&gt;allow_access_if(
                       "/foo/bar/gorch",
                       sub { return $boolean },
               );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides Access Control List style path protection, with arbitrary rules for Catalyst
       applications. It operates only on the Catalyst private namespace, at least at the moment.

       The two hierarchies of actions and controllers in Catalyst are:

       Private Namespace
           Every  action  has its own private path. This path reflects the Perl namespaces the actions were born
           in, and the namespaces of their controllers.

       External Namespace
           Some actions are also directly accessible from the outside, via a URL.

           The private and external paths will be the same, if you are using Local  actions.  Alternatively  you
           can use "Path", "Regex", or "Global" to specify a different external path for your action.

       The  ACL  module  currently  only knows to exploit the private namespace. In the future extensions may be
       made to support external namespaces as well.

       Various types of rules are supported, see the list under "RULES".

       When a path is visited, rules are tested one after the other, with the most exact rule fitting  the  path
       first, and continuing up the path. Testing continues until a rule explcitly allows or denies access.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>allow_access_if</b>
       Arguments: $path, $rule

       Check the rule condition and allow access to the actions under $path if the rule returns true.

       This  is  normally  useful  to  allow  acces  only  to  a  specific  part  of  a  tree whose parent has a
       "deny_access_unless" clause attached to it.

       If the rule test returns false access is not denied or allowed. Instead the next rule in the  chain  will
       be checked - in this sense the combinatory behavior of these rules is like logical <b>OR</b>.

   <b>allow_access_if_any</b>
       Arguments: $path, \@roles

       Same as above for any role in the list.

   <b>deny_access_unless</b>
       Arguments: $path, $rule

       Check the rule condition and disallow access if the rule returns false.

       This  is  normally useful to restrict access to any portion of the application unless a certain condition
       can be met.

       If the rule test returns true access is not allowed or denied. Instead the next rule in the chain will be
       checked - in this sense the combinatory behavior of these rules is like logical <b>AND</b>.

   <b>deny_access_unless_any</b>
       Arguments: $path, \@roles

       Same as above for any role in the list.

   <b>allow_access</b>
   <b>deny_access</b>
       Arguments: $path

       Unconditionally allow or deny access to a path.

   <b>acl_add_rule</b>
       Arguments: $path, $rule, [ $filter ]

       Manually add a rule to all the actions under $path using the more flexible (but more verbose) method:

           __PACKAGE__-&gt;acl_add_rule(
               "/foo",
               sub { ... }, # see FLEXIBLE RULES below
               sub {
                   my $action = shift;
                   # return a true value if you want to apply the rule to this action
                   # called for all the actions under "/foo"
               }
           };

       In this case the rule must be a sub reference (or method name) to be invoked on $c.

       The default filter will skip all actions starting with an underscore, namely  "_DISPATCH",  "_AUTO",  etc
       (but not "auto", "begin", et al).

   <b>acl_access_denied</b>
       Arguments: $c, $class, $action, $err

   <b>acl_access_allowed</b>
       Arguments: $c, $class, $action

       The  default  event  handlers  for  access  denied  or  allowed  conditions. See below on handling access
       violations.

   <b>acl_allow_root_internals</b>
       Adds  rules  that  permit  access  to  the  root  controller  (YourApp.pm)  "auto",  "begin"  and   "end"
       unconditionally.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>execute</b>
       The hook for rule evaluation

   <b>setup_actions</b>
</pre><h4><b>RULE</b> <b>EVALUATION</b></h4><pre>
       When  a  rule  is attached to an action the "distance" from the path it was specified in is recorded. The
       closer the path is to the rule, the earlier it will be checked.

       Any rule can either explicitly deny or explicitly allow access to a particular action. If a rule does not
       explicitly allow or permit access, the next rule is checked, until the list of rules is finished.  If  no
       rule has determined a policy, access to the path will be permitted.

</pre><h4><b>PATHS</b></h4><pre>
       To apply a rule to an action or group of actions you must supply a path.

       This path is what you should see dumped at the beginning of the Catalyst server's debug output.

       For  example,  for  the "foo" action defined at the root level of your application, specify "/foo". Under
       the "Moose" controller (e.g.  "MyApp::C::Moose", the action "bar" will be "/moose/bar").

       The "distance" a path has from an action that is contained in it is the the difference in the  number  of
       slashes between the path of the action, and the path to which the rule was applied.

</pre><h4><b>RULES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Easy</b> <b>Rules</b>
       There  are  several  kinds  of  rules  you  can  create  without using the complex interface described in
       "FLEXIBLE RULES".

       The easy rules are all predicate list oriented. "allow_access_if" will explicitly  allow  access  if  the
       predicate is true, and "deny_access_unless" will explicitly disallow if the predicate is false.

       Role Lists
             __PACAKGE__-&gt;deny_access_unless_any( "/foo/bar", [qw/admin moose_trainer/] );

           When  the  role is evaluated the Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::Roles will be used to check whether
           the currently logged in user has the specified roles.

           If "allow_access_if_any" is used, the presence of <b>any</b> of the  roles  in  the  list  will  immediately
           permit access, and if "deny_access_unless_any" is used, the lack of <b>all</b> of the roles will immediately
           deny access.

           Similarly,  if  "allow_access_if"  is  used,  the  presence  of <b>all</b> the roles will immediately permit
           access, and if "deny_access_unless" is used, the lack of <b>any</b>  of  the  roles  will  immediately  deny
           access.

           When  specifying a role list without the Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::Roles plugin loaded the ACL
           engine will throw an error.

       Predicate Code Reference / Method Name
           The code reference or method is invoked with the context and the action objects. The  boolean  return
           value will determine the behavior of the rule.

               __PACKAGE__-&gt;allow_access_if( "/gorch", sub { ... } );
               __PACKAGE__-&gt;deny_access_unless( "/moose", "method_name" );

           When  specifying  a  method  name  the  rule  engine  ensures  that  it can be invoked using "can" in
           UNIVERSAL.

       Constant
           You can use "undef", 0 and '' to use as a constant false predicate, or 1 to use as  a  constant  true
           predicate.

   <b>Flexible</b> <b>Rules</b>
       These rules are the most annoying to write but provide the most flexibility.

       All access control is performed using exceptions - $Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::ACL::Engine::DENIED,
       and  $Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::ACL::Engine::ALLOWED  (these  can  be  imported  from  the  engine
       module).

       If no rule decides to explicitly allow or deny access, access will be permitted.

       Here is a rule that will always break out of rule processing by either  explicitly  allowing  or  denying
       access based on how much mojo the current user has:

           __PACKAGE__-&gt;acl_add_rule(
               "/foo",
               sub {
                   my ( $c, $action ) = @_;

                   if ( $c-&gt;user-&gt;mojo &gt; 50 ) {
                       die $ALLOWED;
                   } else {
                       die $DENIED;
                   }
               }
           );

</pre><h4><b>HANDLING</b> <b>DENIAL</b></h4><pre>
       There are two plugin methods that can be called when a rule makes a decision about an action:

       acl_access_allowed
           A no-op

       acl_access_denied
           Looks  for  a  private  action named "access_denied" from the denied action's controller and outwards
           (much like "auto"), and if none is found throws an access denied exception.

       forcibly_allow_access
           Within an "access_denied" action this will immediately  cause  the  blocked  action  to  be  executed
           anyway.

       This means that you have several alternatives:

   <b>Provide</b> <b>an</b> <b>"access_denied"</b> <b>action</b>
           package MyApp::Controller::Foo;

           sub access_denied : Private {
               my ( $self, $c, $action ) = @_;

               ...
               $c-&gt;forcibly_allow_access
                   if $you-&gt;mean_it eq "really";
           }

       If  you call "forcibly_allow_access" then the blocked action will be immediately unblocked. Otherwise the
       execution of the action will cease, and return to it's caller or end.

   <b>Cleanup</b> <b>in</b> <b>"end"</b>
           sub end : Private {
               my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

               if ( $c-&gt;error and $c-&gt;error-&gt;[-1] eq "access denied" ) {
                   $c-&gt;<a href="../man0/error.0.html">error</a>(0); # clear the error

                   # access denied
               } else {
                   # normal end
               }
           }

   <b>Override</b> <b>the</b> <b>plugin</b> <b>event</b> <b>handler</b> <b>methods</b>
           package MyApp;

           sub acl_access_allowed {
               my ( $c, $class, $action ) = @_;
               ...
           }

           sub acl_access_denied {
               my ( $c, $class, $action, $err ) = @_;
               ...
           }

       $class is the controller class the $action object was going to be executed in, and $err is the  exception
       cought during rule evaluation, if any (access is denied if a rule raises an exception).
