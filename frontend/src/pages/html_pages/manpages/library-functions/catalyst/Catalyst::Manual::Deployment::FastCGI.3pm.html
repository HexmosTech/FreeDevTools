       Catalyst::Manual::Deployment::FastCGI - Deploying Catalyst with FastCGI

</pre><h4><b>FastCGI</b> <b>Deployment</b></h4><pre>
       FastCGI is a high-performance extension to CGI. It is suitable for production environments, and is the
       standard method for deploying Catalyst in shared hosting environments.

   <b>Pros</b>
       <u>Speed</u>

       FastCGI performs equally as well as mod_perl.  Don't let the 'CGI' fool you; your app runs as multiple
       persistent processes ready to receive connections from the web server.

       <u>App</u> <u>Server</u>

       When using external FastCGI servers, your application runs as a standalone application server.  It may be
       restarted independently from the web server.  This allows for a more robust environment and faster reload
       times when pushing new app changes.  The frontend server can even be configured to display a friendly
       "down for maintenance" page while the application is restarting.

       <u>Load-balancing</u>

       You can launch your application on multiple backend servers and allow the frontend web server to perform
       load-balancing among all of them. And of course, if one goes down, your app continues to run.

       <u>Multiple</u> <u>versions</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>app</u>

       Each FastCGI application is a separate process, so you can run different versions of the same app on a
       single server.

       <u>Can</u> <u>run</u> <u>with</u> <u>threaded</u> <u>Apache</u>

       Since your app is not running inside of Apache, the faster mpm_worker module can be used without worrying
       about the thread safety of your application.

       <u>Widely</u> <u>supported.</u>

       FastCGI is compatible with many server implementations, not just Apache.

   <b>Cons</b>
       You may have to disable mod_deflate.  If you experience page hangs with mod_fastcgi then remove
       deflate.load and deflate.conf from mods-enabled/

       <u>More</u> <u>complex</u> <u>environment</u>

       With FastCGI, there are more things to monitor and more processes running than when using mod_perl.

   <b>Standalone</b> <b>FastCGI</b> <b>Server</b>
       In server mode the application runs as a standalone server and accepts connections from a web server.
       The application can be on the same machine as the web server, on a remote machine, or even on multiple
       remote machines.  Advantages of this method include running the Catalyst application as a different user
       than the web server, and the ability to set up a scalable server farm.

       To start your application in server mode, install the FCGI::ProcManager module and then use the included
       fastcgi.pl script.

           $ script/myapp_fastcgi.pl -l /tmp/myapp.socket -n 5

       Command line options for fastcgi.pl include:

           -d -daemon     Daemonize the server.
           -p -pidfile    Write a pidfile with the pid of the process manager.
           -l -listen     Listen on a socket path, hostname:port, or :port.
           -n -nproc      The number of processes started to handle requests.

       See below for the specific web server configurations for using the external server.

</pre><h4><b>WEB</b> <b>SERVERS</b></h4><pre>
       Any web server which supports FastCGI should work with Catalyst. Configuration recipes for well-known web
       servers are linked below, and we would welcome contributions from people deploying Catalyst on other web
       servers.
