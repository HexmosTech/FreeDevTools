</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  tutorial  provides  a  multi-part introduction to the Catalyst Web Framework. It seeks to provide a
       rapid overview of many of its most commonly used features. The focus is on the real-world best  practices
       required in the construction of nearly all Catalyst applications.

       Although the primary target of the tutorial is users new to the Catalyst framework, experienced users may
       wish  to  review  specific  sections  (for  example,  how to use DBIC for their model classes, how to add
       authentication and authorization to an existing application, and/or form management).

       The most recent code for the tutorial is included on the Tutorial Virtual Machine you can download from:

       &lt;<a href="http://cattut.shadowcat.co.uk/">http://cattut.shadowcat.co.uk/</a>&gt;

       See "STARTING WITH THE TUTORIAL VIRTUAL MACHINE" below for instructions getting and using the VM.

       Should you wish to download the code directly, you get pull it via  the  following  command  (note:  will
       probably be switching to git soon):

           svn co <a href="http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/repos/Catalyst/trunk/examples/Tutorial/">http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/repos/Catalyst/trunk/examples/Tutorial/</a> CatalystTutorial

       This  will  download  the  most  recent  code  for each chapter of the tutorial into the CatalystTutorial
       directory on your machine.

       These reference implementations are provided so that when you follow the tutorial, you can use  the  code
       to  ensure  that  your  system  is  set up correctly (which shouldn't be an issue if you use the Tutorial
       Virtual Machine), :-) and that you have not inadvertently made any typographic  errors,  or  accidentally
       skipped part of the tutorial.

       <b>NOTE:</b>  <b>You</b>  <b>can</b>  <b>use</b>  <b>any</b>  <b>Perl-supported</b> <b>OS</b> <b>and</b> <b>environment</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>Catalyst.</b> It should make little or no
       difference to Catalyst's operation, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>tutorial</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>using</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>Debian-based</b>  <b>Tutorial</b>
       <b>Virtual</b>  <b>Machine</b>  that  you  can  download  and  use  to work through the full tutorial step by step.  <b>WE</b>
       <b>STRONGLY</b> <b>RECOMMEND</b> <b>THAT</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>USE</b> <b>THE</b> <b>VIRTUAL</b> <b>MACHINE</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>TO</b> <b>WORK</b> <b>THROUGH</b> <b>THE</b> <b>TUTORIAL</b>  to  avoid  issues
       that  may crop up if you are working with a different configuration.  We have tested the Tutorial Virtual
       Machine to make sure all of the examples work correctly, but it  is  hard  to  guarantee  this  on  other
       platforms and versions.

       If  you  would  prefer  to  install  directly from CPAN and not use the Tutorial Virtual machine, you can
       download the example program and all the necessary dependencies to your local machine by  installing  the
       Task::Catalyst::Tutorial distribution:

            cpan Task::Catalyst::Tutorial

       This  will  also  test  to make sure the dependencies are working.  If you have trouble installing these,
       please ask for help on the #catalyst IRC channel, or the Catalyst mailing list.

       Subjects covered by the tutorial include:

       •   A simple application that lists and adds books.

       •   The use of DBIx::Class (DBIC) for the model (including some of the more advanced techniques you  will
           probably want to use in your applications).

       •   How to write CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations in Catalyst.

       •   Authentication ("auth").

       •   Role-based authorization ("authz").

       •   Attempts to provide an example showing current (5.9) Catalyst practices.

       •   The use of Template Toolkit (TT).

       •   Useful techniques for troubleshooting and debugging Catalyst applications.

       •   The  use  of SQLite as a database (with code also provided for MySQL and PostgreSQL).  (Note: Because
           we make use of the DBIx::Class Object Relational Mapping [ORM] layer, out  our  application  will  be
           database agnostic and can easily be used by any of the databases supported by DBIx::Class.)

       •   The use of HTML::FormFu or HTML::FormHandler for automated form processing and validation.

       This  tutorial  makes  the learning process its main priority.  For example, the level of comments in the
       code found here would likely be considered excessive in a "normal project."  Because of their  contextual
       value,  this  tutorial  will  generally favor inline comments over a separate discussion in the text.  It
       also deliberately tries to demonstrate multiple approaches to various features (in  general,  you  should
       try to be as consistent as possible with your own production code).

       Furthermore,  this  tutorial  tries  to  minimize  the  number  of controllers, models, TT templates, and
       database tables.  Although this does result in things being a bit contrived at times, the concepts should
       be applicable to more complex environments.  More complete and complicated example  applications  can  be
       found  at  &lt;<a href="http://wiki.catalystframework.org/wiki/resources/catalystexamples">http://wiki.catalystframework.org/wiki/resources/catalystexamples</a>&gt; and in the "examples" area
       of the Catalyst Subversion repository at &lt;<a href="http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/repos/Catalyst/trunk/examples/">http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/repos/Catalyst/trunk/examples/</a>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>STARTING</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>THE</b> <b>TUTORIAL</b> <b>VIRTUAL</b> <b>MACHINE</b></h4><pre>
       The steps below briefly outline how you can download the Tutorial Virtual Machine.   This  document  uses
       the  term  "host machine" to refer to the physical machine where you will run the virtualization software
       and boot up the VM.  The terms "guest machine" or just "VM" refer to the virtual machine  itself  --  the
       thing where you actually do the tutorial (and that you boot up on the "host machine").

       <b>Note:</b>  Throughout  the  tutorial,  we  will  shows  the UNIX shell prompt as ""$"".  If you are using the
       Tutorial VM, the prompt will really be ""catalyst@catalyst:~$"" (where ""~"" will  change  to  show  your
       current directory), but we will keep it short and just use ""$"".

       1.  Download a Tutorial Virtual Machine image from &lt;<a href="http://cattut.shadowcat.co.uk/">http://cattut.shadowcat.co.uk/</a>&gt;

           <b>A</b>  <b>big</b>  <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>Shadowcat</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>for</b> <b>hosting</b> <b>the</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>machines</b> <b>(and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b>
           <b>the</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>community)!</b>

       2.  Uncompress the image on the "host machine":

               MAINCOMPUTER:~$ tar zxvf CatalystTutorial.tgz

       3.  Boot      the      virtual      machine      using      a      tool      like      VMWare      Player
           &lt;https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html&gt;                or                VirtualBox
           &lt;https://www.virtualbox.org/&gt;.

       4.  Once you get a login prompt, enter the username <b>catalyst</b> and a password for "catalyst".   You  should
           now be at a prompt that looks like:

               catalyst login: catalyst
               Password: catalyst
               ...
               catalyst@catalyst:~$

       5.  Type ""ifconfig"" to get the IP address assigned to the virtual machine.  You should get output along
           the lines of:

               eth0  Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:01:22:3b:45:69
                     inet addr:192.168.0.12  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
               ...

           You  want  the  IP  address  on the second line below the "eth0" interface.  The image is designed to
           automatically use a DHCP-assigned address.

           Try to ping this IP address from your "host machine" (main desktop):

               MAINCOMPUTER:~$ ping 192.168.0.12
               PING 192.168.0.12 (192.168.0.12) <a href="../man84/56.84.html">56</a>(84) bytes of data.
               64 bytes from 192.168.0.12: icmp_req=1 ttl=255 time=4.97 ms
               64 bytes from 192.168.0.12: icmp_req=2 ttl=255 time=3.43 ms
               ...

           <b>Note:</b> The ping above is being originated <b>from</b> your <b>host</b> <b>machine</b> (main  desktop)  and  going  <b>to</b>  your
           guest <b>virtual</b> <b>machine</b>, not the other way around.

           If  you are not seeing a valid IP address or it's not responding to pings (for example, you get error
           messages along  the  lines  of  "Request  timed  out",  "100%  packet  loss",  or  "Destination  Host
           Unreachable"),  there  could  be  a  few  network-related issues you might need to sort out.  See the
           section below "Sorting Out Virtual Machine Network-Related Issues"  for  additional  information  and
           troubleshooting advice.

           <b>Note:</b> Remember this IP address... you will be using it throughout the tutorial.

       6.  <b>From</b>  <b>your</b>  <b>main</b>  <b>desktop</b>  <b>machine</b>,  open  an  SSH  client and connect to the IP address found in the
           previous step.  You should get a login prompt (accept the SSH key if you get a warning message  about
           that).  Login with the same username and password as we used in Step 4: <b>catalyst</b> / <b>catalyst</b>

               catalyst login: catalyst
               Password: catalyst
               ...
               catalyst@catalyst:~$

       7.  <b>Using</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>SSH</b> <b>session</b>, change to the sample code directory for Chapter 3 included with the Tutorial
           Virtual Machine and start the Catalyst Development Server:

               $ cd Final/Chapter03/MyApp
               $ perl script/myapp_server.pl

       8.  <b>From</b>  <b>your</b>  <b>main</b>  <b>desktop</b>  <b>machine</b>  (the  "host  machine"),  open   a   web   browser   and   go   to
           <b><a href="http://A.B.C.D">http://A.B.C.D</a>:3000/</b>, where "A.B.C.D" is the IP address to your virtual machine that you looked up in
           Step 5.  For example, if your virtual machine is using the IP address 192.168.0.12, you would put the
           following URL into your web browser:

               <a href="http://192.168.0.12">http://192.168.0.12</a>:3000/

           Make  sure  you  don't forget the <b>:3000</b> to use port 3000 instead of the usual port 80 that is used by
           HTTP by default.

           You should get a Catalyst Welcome Screen.  If you do, feel free to jump right in to Chapter 2 of  the
           tutorial.   If  you don't go get the Catalyst Welcome Screen, go back and carefully check each of the
           steps above.

       9.  <b>Optional:</b> Also, to reduce download size,  the  Tutorial  VM  just  includes  a  minimal  command-line
           environment.   You  are  free  to  use  Debian's  very capable "apt" package manager to install other
           packages.  You will first want to pull the apt  cache  files  with  "aptitude  update"  (or  "apt-get
           update" if you prefer apt-get).

           The  VI/VIM editor is already installed on the Tutorial Virtual Machine.  In order to reduce the size
           of the download, Emacs is not pre-installed.  Since people obviously have very strong opinions  about
           which editor is best, :-) fortunately it's very easy to install Emacs:

               $ sudo aptitude update
               $ sudo aptitude install emacs

           In  general, it is expected that people will boot up the Tutorial VM on their main desktop (the "host
           machine" using the terminology above) and then use that main desktop machine to SSH  and  web  browse
           into  the  "guest  VM"  as  they work through the tutorial.  If you wish to install X Windows (or any
           other packages), just use the "aptitude" (or "apt-get") Debian commands.

           For example, to install X Windows with Fluxbox (a lightweight WindowManager -- it is great for things
           like this tutorial since it's about 1/10th the size of other common X Windows environments), you  can
           do:

               $ sudo aptitude update
               $ sudo aptitude install xorg fluxbox iceweasel

           And then start X Windows from the <b>VM</b> <b>Console</b> with this command:

               $ startx

           Note  that  if  you want to start Fluxbox from an SSH session, you can use the "sudo dpkg-reconfigure
           x11-common" and select "anybody" from the menu.  Otherwise, you will need to be  on  the  actual  "VM
           console" to start it.

           If you have a preference for the Gnome desktop environment, you can do:

               $ sudo aptitude update
               $ sudo aptitude install gnome iceweasel
               $
               $ # You can reboot or start with 'startx', we will just reboot here
               $ reboot

           For KDE, just substitute the package name ""kde"" for ""gnome"" above.

               $ sudo aptitude install kde iceweasel

           Note that "iceweasel" is basically used to install Firefox on Debian boxes.  You can start it under X
           Windows with either the "firefox" command or the "iceweasel" command (or use the menus).  You can get
           more information on Iceweasel at &lt;https://wiki.debian.org/Iceweasel&gt;.

           Also,  you  might  need  to  add more memory to your virtual machine if you want to run X Windows (or
           other tools that might require additional memory).  Consult the documentation of your  virtualization
           software for instructions on how to do this (it's usually pretty simple).

       You  may  note  that  the  Tutorial Virtual Machine uses local::lib so that the Perl modules are run from
       <a href="file:~/perl5">~/perl5</a> (in this case, /home/catalyst/perl5) vs. the usual location of your "system Perl".  We  recommend
       that  you also consider using this very handy module.  It can greatly ease the process of maintaining and
       testing different combinations or Perl modules across development, staging, and production servers.  (The
       "relocatable Perl" feature can also be used to run both the  modules  <b>and</b>  Perl  itself  from  your  home
       directory [or any other directory you chose]).

       <b>Note</b>: Please provide feedback on how the Virtual Machine approach for the tutorial works for you.  If you
       have  suggestions  or  comments, you can reach the author through the email address at the bottom of this
       page or via an RT ticket at &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Catalyst-Manual&gt;.

   <b>Sorting</b> <b>Out</b> <b>Virtual</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Network-Related</b> <b>Issues</b>
       In general, using a virtual machine to work through the tutorial is *much* easier than trying to do it in
       other environments, especially if you are new to Catalyst (or  Perl  or  CPAN  or  ...).   However,  it's
       possible  that  you  could run into a few network-related issues.  The good news is that there is lots of
       information about the issue available via search engines  on  the  Internet.   Here  is  some  background
       information to get you started.

       In  Step  5 of the prior section above, we assumed that a "Bridged Mode" configuration and DHCP will work
       (it should for most people).  If DHCP is not working or is not available in your location,  most  virtual
       machine  "host"  environments let you select between one of several different types of networking between
       the "guest" and the "host" machine.

           1) Bridged
           2) NAT
           3) Local host only

       The Tutorial Virtual Machine defaults to "Bridged" -- this should result in the VM  acting  like  another
       device on your network that will get a different DHCP IP address than the host machine.  The advantage of
       this  approach, is that you can easily SSH and web browse to the guest virtual machine.  In general, this
       is the best option if you want to be able to boot up the VM and then use your SSH client and web  browser
       from your main machine to connect into the virtual machine.

       In  some  environments,  you  might have better luck with "NAT" (Network Address Translation) mode.  With
       this configuration, the guest VM shares the same IP address as the host machine.  The  downside  of  this
       approach  is  that  special  configuration is required if you want to be able to SSH or web browse to the
       guest VM.  The NAT option should automatically allow the VM "outbound connection" (e.g., to the  Internet
       if  you want to install additional Debian packages), but it requires special configuration if you want to
       get "inbound connections" that go from some other machine (including the "host  machine")  into  the  VM.
       Some virtual machine host environments let you configure a "static NAT" or "port forwarding" to reach the
       guest OS, but others omit this functionality.

       Note:  NAT mode can work fine if you install X Windows and do the whole tutorial locally on the actual VM
       vs. using SSH and a web browser from your host machine.

       "Local host only" mode let's the guest VM and the host machine talk on  a  "private  subnet"  that  other
       devices  in  your network cannot reach.  This can work as long as you don't need to go from the VM to the
       Internet (for example, to install other Debian packages).

       Consult the documentation on your virtual machine host  environment  for  help  configuring  the  options
       above.  Here are some links that might help:

</pre><h4><b>VERSIONS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CONVENTIONS</b> <b>USED</b> <b>IN</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>TUTORIAL</b></h4><pre>
       This  tutorial was built using the following resources. Please note that you may need to make adjustments
       for different environments and versions (note that trailing zeros in version numbers are not  significant
       and  may  get dropped with some techniques for viewing them; for example, Catalyst v5.80020 might show up
       as 5.8002):

       •   Debian 6 (Squeeze)

       •   Catalyst v5.90002

       •   Catalyst::Devel v1.34

       •   DBIx::Class v0.08195

       •   Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema v0.54

       •   Template Toolkit v2.22

       •   HTML::FormFu -- v0.09004

       •   <b>NOTE:</b> You can check the versions you have installed with the following command (note the slash before
           the space):

               perl -M&lt;_mod_name_&gt;\ 999

           or:

               perl -M&lt;_mod_name_&gt; -e 'print "$&lt;_mod_name_&gt;::VERSION\n"'

           For example:

               perl -MCatalyst::Devel\ 999

           or:

               perl -MCatalyst::Devel -e 'print "$Catalyst::Devel::VERSION\n";'

       •   This tutorial will show URLs in the format of "<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:3000", but if you  are  running  your
           web  browser from outside the Tutorial Virtual Machine, you will want to substitute the IP address of
           your VM for the "localhost" in the URLs (again, you  can  get  the  IP  address  for  eth0  from  the
           "ifconfig" command).  For example, if your VM has an IP address of 192.168.0.12, you will want to use
           a  base  URL  of  "<a href="http://192.168.0.12">http://192.168.0.12</a>:3000".  Note that the development server defaults to port 3000
           (you can change with the "-p" option on the command line).

           <b>Please</b> <b>Note:</b> Depending on the web browser you are using, you might  need  to  hit  "Shift+Reload"  or
           "Ctrl+Reload"   to  pull  a  fresh  page  when  testing  your  application  at  various  points  (see
           &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bypass_your_cache&gt; for a comprehensive list of  options  for
           each browser).

           Also,  the  "-k"  <b>keepalive</b>  <b>option</b>  to  the  development  server can be necessary with some browsers
           (<b>especially</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b>).

</pre><h4><b>DATABASES</b></h4><pre>
       This tutorial will primarily focus on SQLite because of its simplicity of installation and use;  however,
       modifications in the script required to support MySQL and PostgreSQL will be presented in the Appendix.

       <b>Note:</b>  One  of the advantages of using tools like Catalyst and DBIC is that applications become much more
       database independent.  As such, you will notice that  only  the  ".sql"  files  used  to  initialize  the
       database change between database systems: most of the code generally remains the same.
