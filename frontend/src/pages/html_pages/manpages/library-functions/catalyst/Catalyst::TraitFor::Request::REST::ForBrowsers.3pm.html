</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST::ForBrowsers - A request trait for REST and browsers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package MyApp;
           use Moose;
           use namespace::autoclean;

           use Catalyst;
           use CatalystX::RoleApplicator;

           extends 'Catalyst';

           __PACKAGE__-&gt;apply_request_class_roles(qw[
               Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST::ForBrowsers
           ]);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Writing REST-y apps is a good thing, but if you're also trying to support web browsers, you're probably
       going to need some hackish workarounds. This module provides those workarounds for you.

       Specifically, it lets you do two things. First, it lets you "tunnel" PUT and DELETE requests across a
       POST, since most browsers do not support PUT or DELETE actions (as of early 2009, at least).

       Second, it provides a heuristic to check if the client is a web browser, regardless of what content types
       it claims to accept. The reason for this is that while a browser might claim to accept the
       "application/xml" content type, it's really not going to do anything useful with it, and you're best off
       giving it HTML.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This class provides the following methods:

   <b>$request-&gt;method</b>
       This method works just like "Catalyst::Request-&gt;method()" except it allows for tunneling of PUT and
       DELETE requests via a POST.

       Specifically, you can provide a form element named "x-tunneled-method" which can override the request
       method for a POST. This <u>only</u> works for a POST, not a GET.

       You can also use a header named "x-http-method-override" instead (Google uses this header for its APIs).

   <b>$request-&gt;looks_like_browser</b>
       This attribute provides a heuristic to determine whether or not the request <u>appears</u> to come from a
       browser. You can use this however you want. I usually use it to determine whether or not to give the
       client a full HTML page or some sort of serialized data.

       This is a heuristic, and like any heuristic, it is probably wrong sometimes. Here is how it works:

       •   If  the  request includes a header "X-Request-With" set to either "HTTP.Request" or "XMLHttpRequest",
           this returns false. The assumption is that if you're doing XHR, you don't want the request treated as
           if it comes from a browser.

       •   If the client makes a GET request with a query string parameter "content-type", and that type is  <u>not</u>
           an HTML type, it is <u>not</u> a browser.

       •   If  the client provides an Accept header which includes "*/*" as an accepted content type, the client
           is a browser. Specifically, it is IE7, which submits an Accept header of "*/*". IE7's  Accept  header
           does not include any html types like "text/html".

       •   If  the client provides an Accept header and accepts either "text/html" or "application/xhtml+xml" it
           is a browser.

       •   If it provides an Accept header of any sort that doesn't match one of the above criteria, it is <u>not</u> a
           browser.

       •   The default is that the client is a browser.

       This all works well for my apps, but read it carefully to make sure it  meets  your  expectations  before
       using it.
