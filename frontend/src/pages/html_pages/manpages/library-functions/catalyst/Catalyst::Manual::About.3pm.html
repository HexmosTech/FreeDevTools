       Catalyst::Manual::About - The philosophy of Catalyst

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document is a basic introduction to the <u>why</u> of Catalyst. It does not teach you how to write Catalyst
       applications; for an introduction to that please see Catalyst::Manual::Intro. Rather, it explains the
       basics of what Catalyst is typically used for, and why you might want to use Catalyst to build your
       applications.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>Catalyst?</b> <b>The</b> <b>short</b> <b>summary</b>
       Catalyst is a web application framework. This means that you use it to help build applications that run
       on the web, or that run using protocols used for the web. Catalyst is designed to make it easy to manage
       the various tasks you need to do to run an application on the web, either by doing them itself, or by
       letting you "plug in" existing Perl modules that do what you need. There are a number of things you
       typically do with a web application. For example:

       •   Interact with a web server

           If  you're on the web, you're relying on a web server, a program that sends files over the web. There
           are a number of these, and your application has to do the right thing to make sure that your  program
           works  with  the  web  server  you're using. If you change your web server, you don't want to have to
           rewrite your entire application to work with the new one.

       •   Do something based on a URI

           It's typical for web applications to use URIs as a main way for users to interact with  the  rest  of
           the  application;  various  elements of the URI will indicate what the application needs to do. Thus,
           "<a href="http://www.mysite.com/add_record.cgi">http://www.mysite.com/add_record.cgi</a>?name=John&amp;title=President" will add a person named "John" whose
           title is "President" to your database, and "<a href="http://www.mysite.com/catalog/display/23">http://www.mysite.com/catalog/display/23</a>" will  go  to  a
           "display"  of item 23 in your catalog, and "<a href="http://www.mysite.com/order_status/7582">http://www.mysite.com/order_status/7582</a>" will display the
           status of order 7582, and "<a href="http://www.mysite.com/add_comment/">http://www.mysite.com/add_comment/</a>?page=8" will display a form  to  add  a
           comment  to page 8. Your application needs to have a regular way of processing these URIs so it knows
           what to do when such a request comes in.

       •   Interact with a data store

           You probably use a database to keep track of your information. Your  application  needs  to  interact
           with your database, so you can create, edit, and retrieve your data.

       •   Handle forms

           When a user submits a form, you receive it, process it to make sure it's been filled in properly, and
           then  do  something  based on the result--submit an order, update a record, send e-mail, or return to
           the form if there's an error.

       •   Display results

           If you have an application running on the web, people need to  see  things.  You  usually  want  your
           application displayed on a web browser, in which case you will probably be using a template system to
           help generate HTML code. But you might need other kinds of display, such as PDF files, or other forms
           of output, such as RSS feeds or e-mail.

       •   Manage users

           You  might  need the concept of a "user", someone who's allowed to use your system, and is allowed to
           do certain things only. Perhaps  normal  users  can  only  view  or  modify  their  own  information;
           administrative  users  can  view  or modify anything; normal users can only order items for their own
           account; normal users can view things but not modify them; order-processing users can send records to
           a different part of the system; and so forth. You need a way of ensuring that people are who they say
           they are, and that people only do the things they're allowed to do.

       •   Develop the application itself

           When you're writing or modifying the application, you want to have access to detailed logs of what it
           is doing. You want to be able to write tests to ensure that it does what it's supposed to,  and  that
           new changes don't break the existing code.

       Catalyst makes it easy to do all of these tasks, and many more. It is extremely flexible in terms of what
       it  allows  you  to do, and very fast.  It has a large number of "components" and "plugins" that interact
       with existing Perl modules so that you can easily use them from within your application.

       •   Interact with a web server?

           Catalyst lets you use a number of different ones, and even comes with a built-in server  for  testing
           or local deployment.

       •   Do something based on a URI?

           Catalyst has extremely flexible systems for figuring out what to do based on a URI.

       •   Interact with a data store?

           Catalyst has many plugins for different databases and database frameworks, and for other non-database
           storage systems.

       •   Handle forms?

           Catalyst has plugins available for several form creation and validation systems that make it easy for
           the programmer to manage.

       •   Display results?

           Catalyst has plugins available for a number of template modules and other output packages.

       •   Manage users?

           Catalyst has plugins that handle sessions, authentication, and authorization, in any way you need.

       •   Developing the application?

           Catalyst  has  detailed logging built-in, which you can configure as necessary, and supports the easy
           creation of new tests--some of  which  are  automatically  created  when  you  begin  writing  a  new
           application.

       <u>What</u> <u><b>isn't</b></u> <u>Catalyst?</u>

       Catalyst  is  not  an  out-of-the-box  solution  that  allows you to set up a complete working e-commerce
       application in ten minutes. (There are, however, several systems built on top of Catalyst  that  can  get
       you very close to a working app.)

       Catalyst  is  designed  for flexibility and power; to an extent, this comes at the expense of simplicity.
       Programmers have many options for almost everything they need to do, which means that any given need  can
       be  done in many ways, and finding the one that's right for you, and learning the right way to do it, can
       take time. TIMTOWDI works both ways.

       Catalyst is not designed for end users, but for working programmers.

   <b>Web</b> <b>programming:</b> <b>The</b> <b>Olden</b> <b>Days</b>
       Perl has long been favored for web applications. There are a wide variety of ways to use Perl on the web,
       and things have changed over time. It's possible to handle everything with very raw Perl code:

           print "Content-type: text/html\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello
           World!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;";

       for example, or

           my @query_elements = split(/&amp;/, $ENV{'QUERY_STRING'});
           foreach my $element (@query_elements) {
               my ($name, $value) = split(/=/, $element);
               # do something with your parameters, or kill yourself
               # in frustration for having to program like this
           }

       Much better than this is to use Lincoln Stein's great CGI module, which smoothly handles a  wide  variety
       of  common  tasks--parameter  parsing,  generating form elements from Perl data structures, printing http
       headers, escaping text, and very many more, all with your choice of functional or object-oriented  style.
       While  CGI  was  revolutionary and is still widely used, it has various drawbacks that make it unsuitable
       for larger applications: it is slow; your code with it generally combines application logic  and  display
       code; and it makes it very difficult to handle larger applications with complicated control flow.

       A  variety  of  frameworks  followed,  of  which the most widely used is probably CGI::Application, which
       encourages the development of modular code, with easy-to-understand control-flow  handling,  the  use  of
       plugins and templating systems, and the like. Other systems include AxKit, which is designed for use with
       XML  running  under  mod_perl;  Maypole--upon  which Catalyst was originally based--designed for the easy
       development of powerful web databases; Jifty, which does a great deal of automation in helping to set  up
       web  sites  with  many  complex  features;  and Ruby on Rails (see &lt;https://rubyonrails.org&gt;), written of
       course in Ruby and among the most popular web development systems. It is not the purpose of this document
       to criticize or even briefly evaluate these other frameworks; they may be useful for you  and  if  so  we
       encourage you to give them a try.

   <b>The</b> <b>MVC</b> <b>pattern</b>
       MVC,  or Model-View-Controller, is a model currently favored for web applications. This design pattern is
       originally from the Smalltalk programming language. The basic idea is that the three  main  areas  of  an
       application--handling  application  flow (Controller), processing information (Model), and outputting the
       results (View)--are kept separate, so that it is possible to change or replace any one without  affecting
       the others, and so that if you're interested in one particular aspect, you know where to find it.

       Discussions of MVC often degenerate into nitpicky arguments about the history of the pattern, and exactly
       what  "usually"  or  "should"  go into the Controller or the Model. We have no interest in joining such a
       debate. In any case, Catalyst does not enforce any particular setup; you are free to put any sort of code
       in any part of your application, and this  discussion,  along  with  others  elsewhere  in  the  Catalyst
       documentation,  are  only  suggestions  based on what we think works well. In most Catalyst applications,
       each branch of MVC will be made of up of several Perl modules that can handle  different  needs  in  your
       application.

       The  purpose  of  the  <b>Model</b>  is  to  access  and  modify  data. Typically the Model will interact with a
       relational database, but it's also common to use other data sources, such as the Xapian search engine  or
       an LDAP server.

       The purpose of the <b>View</b> is to present data to the user. Typical Views use a templating module to generate
       HTML code, using Template Toolkit, Mason, HTML::Template, or the like, but it's also possible to generate
       PDF  output, send e-mail, etc., from a View. In Catalyst applications the View is usually a small module,
       just gluing some other module into Catalyst; the display logic is written within the template itself.

       The <b>Controller</b> is Catalyst itself. When a request is made to Catalyst, it will be received by one of your
       Controller modules; this module will figure out what the user is trying to do, gather the necessary  data
       from a Model, and send it to a View for display.

       <u>A</u> <u>simple</u> <u>example</u>

       The  general  idea  is that you should be able to change things around without affecting the rest of your
       application. Let's look at a very simple example (keeping in mind that there are many ways of doing this,
       and what we're discussing is one possible way, not the only way). Suppose you have a record  to  display.
       It  doesn't  matter  if it's a catalog entry, a library book, a music CD, a personnel record, or anything
       else,   but   let's   pretend   it's   a   catalog   entry.   A   user   is   given   a   URL   such   as
       "<a href="http://www.mysite.com/catalog/display/2782">http://www.mysite.com/catalog/display/2782</a>". Now what?

       First,  Catalyst figures out that you're using the "catalog" Controller (how Catalyst figures this out is
       entirely up to you; URL dispatching is <u>extremely</u> flexible in Catalyst). Then Catalyst determines that you
       want to use a "display" method in your "catalog" Controller. (There could be other "display"  methods  in
       other  Controllers,  too.)  Somewhere  in this process, it's possible that you'll have authentication and
       authorization routines to make sure that the user is registered and is allowed to display a  record.  The
       Controller's  "display"  method  will  then extract "2782" as the record you want to retrieve, and make a
       request to a Model for that record. The Controller will then look at what the Model returns:  if  there's
       no  record, the Controller will ask the View to display an error message, otherwise it will hand the View
       the record and ask the View to display it. In either case, the View will  then  generate  an  HTML  page,
       which Catalyst will send to the user's browser, using whatever web server you've configured.

       <u>How</u> <u>does</u> <u>this</u> <u>help</u> <u>you?</u>

       In  many  ways.  Suppose  you  have  a small catalog now, and you're using a lightweight database such as
       SQLite, or maybe just a text file. But eventually your site grows, and you need to upgrade  to  something
       more  powerful--MySQL  or  Postgres,  or  even Oracle or DB2. If your Model is separate, you only have to
       change one thing, the Model; your Controller can expect that if it issues a query to the Model,  it  will
       get the right kind of result back.

       What  about  the  View? The idea is that your template is concerned almost entirely with display, so that
       you can hand it off to a designer who doesn't have to worry about how to write code. If you get  all  the
       data  in the Controller and then pass it to the View, the template isn't responsible for any kind of data
       processing. And if you want to change your output, it's simple: just write a new View. If your Controller
       is already getting the data you need, you can pass it in the  same  way,  and  whether  you  display  the
       results  to  a web browser, generate a PDF, or e-mail the results back to the user, the Controller hardly
       changes at all--it's up to the View.

       And throughout the whole process, most of the tools you need are either part of Catalyst (the  parameter-
       processing  routines  that  extract  "2782" from the URL, for example) or are easily plugged into it (the
       authentication routines, or the plugins for using Template Toolkit as your View).

       Now, Catalyst doesn't enforce very much at all. Template Toolkit is a very  powerful  templating  system,
       and  you  can  connect  to a database, issue queries, and act on them from within a TT-based View, if you
       want. You can handle paging (i.e. retrieving only a portion  of  the  total  records  possible)  in  your
       Controller  or  your Model. In the above example, your Controller looked at the query result, determining
       whether to ask the View for a no-result error message, or  for  a  result  display;  but  it's  perfectly
       possible to hand your query result directly to the View, and let your template decide what to do. It's up
       to you; Catalyst doesn't enforce anything.

       In  some cases there might be very good reasons to do things a certain way (issuing database queries from
       a template defeats the whole purpose of separation-of-concerns, and  will  drive  your  designer  crazy),
       while  in  others  it's  just  a  matter  of personal preference (perhaps your template, rather than your
       Controller, is the better place to decide what to display if you get  an  empty  result).  Catalyst  just
       gives you the tools.
