       Catalyst::Manual::Actions - Catalyst Reusable Actions

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This section of the manual describes the reusable action system in Catalyst, how such actions work,
       descriptions of some existing ones, and how to write your own.  Reusable actions are attributes on
       Catalyst methods that allow you to decorate your method with functions running before or after the method
       call.  This can be used to implement commonly used action patterns, while still leaving you full freedom
       to customize them.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This is pretty simple. Actions work just like the normal dispatch attributes you are used to, like Local
       or Private:

           sub Hello :Local :ActionClass('SayBefore') {
               $c-&gt;res-&gt;output( 'Hello '.$c-&gt;stash-&gt;{what} );
           }

       In this example, we expect the SayBefore action to magically populate stash with something relevant
       before "Hello" is run.  In the next section we'll show you how to implement it. If you want it in a
       namespace other than Catalyst::Action you can prefix the action name with a '+', for instance
       '+Foo::SayBefore', or if you just want it under your application namespace instead, use MyAction, like
       MyAction('SayBefore').

</pre><h4><b>WRITING</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>OWN</b> <b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Implementing the action itself is almost as easy. Just use Catalyst::Action as a base class and decorate
       the "execute" call in the Action class:

           package Catalyst::Action::MyAction;
           use Moose;
           use namespace::autoclean;

           extends 'Catalyst::Action';

           before 'execute' =&gt; sub {
               my ( $self, $controller, $c, $test ) = @_;
               $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{what} = 'world';
           };

           after 'execute' =&gt; sub {
               my ( $self, $controller, $c, $test ) = @_;
               $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{foo} = 'bar';
           };

           __PACKAGE__-&gt;meta-&gt;make_immutable;

       Pretty simple, huh?

</pre><h4><b>ACTION</b> <b>ROLES</b></h4><pre>
       You can only have one action class per action, which can be somewhat inflexible.

       The solution to this is to use Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole, which would make the example above look
       like this:

           package Catalyst::ActionRole::MyActionRole;
           use Moose::Role;

           before 'execute' =&gt; sub {
               my ( $self, $controller, $c, $test ) = @_;
               $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{what} = 'world';
           };

           after 'execute' =&gt; sub {
               my ( $self, $controller, $c, $test ) = @_;
               $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{foo} = 'bar';
           };

           1;

       and this would be used in a controller like this:

           package MyApp::Controller::Foo;
           use Moose;
           use namespace::autoclean;
           BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole'; }

           sub foo : Does('MyActionRole') {
               my ($self, $c) = @_;
           }

           1;

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b> <b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Catalyst::Action::RenderView</b>
       This is meant to decorate end actions. It's similar in operation to Catalyst::Plugin::DefaultEnd, but
       allows you to decide on an action level rather than on an application level where it should be run.

   <b>Catalyst::Action::REST</b>
       Provides additional syntax for dispatching based upon the HTTP method of the request.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b> <b>ACTIONROLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Catalyst::ActionRole::ACL</b>
       Provides ACLs for role membership by decorating your actions.
