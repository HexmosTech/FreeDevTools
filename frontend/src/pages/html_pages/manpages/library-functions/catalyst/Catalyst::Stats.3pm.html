       Catalyst::Stats - Catalyst Timing Statistics Class

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           $stats = $c-&gt;stats;
           $stats-&gt;<a href="../man1/enable.1.html">enable</a>(1);
           $stats-&gt;profile($comment);
           $stats-&gt;profile(begin =&gt; $block_name, comment =&gt;$comment);
           $stats-&gt;profile(end =&gt; $block_name);
           $elapsed = $stats-&gt;elapsed;
           $report = $stats-&gt;report;

       See Catalyst.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides the default, simple timing stats collection functionality for Catalyst.  If you want
       something different set "MyApp-&gt;stats_class" in your application module, e.g.:

           __PACKAGE__-&gt;stats_class( "My::Stats" );

       If you write your own, your stats object is expected to provide the interface described here.

       Catalyst uses this class to report timings of component actions.  You can add profiling points into your
       own code to get deeper insight. Typical usage might be like this:

         sub mysub {
           my ($c, ...) = @_;
           $c-&gt;stats-&gt;profile(begin =&gt; "mysub");
           # code goes here
           ...
           $c-&gt;stats-&gt;profile("starting critical bit");
           # code here too
           ...
           $c-&gt;stats-&gt;profile("completed first part of critical bit");
           # more code
           ...
           $c-&gt;stats-&gt;profile("completed second part of critical bit");
           # more code
           ...
           $c-&gt;stats-&gt;profile(end =&gt; "mysub");
         }

       Supposing mysub was called from the action "process" inside a Catalyst Controller called "service", then
       the reported timings for the above example might look something like this:

         .----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------.
         | Action                                                         | Time      |
         +----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
         | /service/process                                               | 1.327702s |
         |  mysub                                                         | 0.555555s |
         |   - starting critical bit                                      | 0.111111s |
         |   - completed first part of critical bit                       | 0.333333s |
         |   - completed second part of critical bit                      | 0.111000s |
         | /end                                                           | 0.000160s |
         '----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------'

       which means mysub took 0.555555s overall, it took 0.111111s to reach the critical bit, the first part of
       the critical bit took 0.333333s, and the second part 0.111s.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       Constructor.

           $stats = Catalyst::Stats-&gt;new;

   <b>enable</b>
           $stats-&gt;<a href="../man0/enable.0.html">enable</a>(0);
           $stats-&gt;<a href="../man1/enable.1.html">enable</a>(1);

       Enable or disable stats collection.  By default, stats are enabled after object creation.

   <b>profile</b>
           $stats-&gt;profile($comment);
           $stats-&gt;profile(begin =&gt; $block_name, comment =&gt;$comment);
           $stats-&gt;profile(end =&gt; $block_name);

       Marks a profiling point.  These can appear in pairs, to time the block of code between the begin/end
       pairs, or by themselves, in which case the time of execution to the previous profiling point will be
       reported.

       The argument may be either a single comment string or a list of name-value pairs.  Thus the following are
       equivalent:

           $stats-&gt;profile($comment);
           $stats-&gt;profile(comment =&gt; $comment);

       The following key names/values may be used:

       •   begin =&gt; ACTION

           Marks the beginning of a block.  The value is used in the description in the timing report.

       •   end =&gt; ACTION

           Marks  the  end  of  the  block.   The  name given must match a previous 'begin'.  Correct nesting is
           recommended, although this module is tolerant of blocks  that  are  not  correctly  nested,  and  the
           reported  timings  should  accurately  reflect  the  time taken to execute the block whether properly
           nested or not.

       •   comment =&gt; COMMENT

           Comment string; use this to describe the profiling point.  It is combined with the block  action  (if
           any) in the timing report description field.

       •   uid =&gt; UID

           Assign  a  predefined  unique  ID.   This  is  useful  if,  for whatever reason, you wish to relate a
           profiling point to a different parent than in the natural execution sequence.

       •   parent =&gt; UID

           Explicitly relate the profiling point back to the parent with the specified UID.  The profiling point
           will be ignored if the UID has not been previously defined.

       Returns the UID of the current point in the profile tree.  The  UID  is  automatically  assigned  if  not
       explicitly given.

   <b>created</b>
           ($seconds, $microseconds) = $stats-&gt;created;

       Returns  the  time  the object was created, in "gettimeofday" format, with Unix epoch seconds followed by
       microseconds.

   <b>elapsed</b>
           $elapsed = $stats-&gt;elapsed

       Get the total elapsed time (in seconds) since the object was created.

   <b>report</b>
           print $stats-&gt;report ."\n";
           $report = $stats-&gt;report;
           @report = $stats-&gt;report;

       In scalar context, generates a textual report.  In array context, returns the array of results where each
       row comprises:

           [ depth, description, time, rollup ]

       The depth is the calling stack level of the profiling point.

       The description is a combination of the block name and comment.

       The time reported for each block is the total execution time for the block, and the time associated  with
       each intermediate profiling point is the elapsed time from the previous profiling point.

       The 'rollup' flag indicates whether the reported time is the rolled up time for the block, or the elapsed
       time from the previous profiling point.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Some  components  might  expect  the  stats object to be a regular Tree::Simple object.  We've added some
       compatibility methods to handle this scenario:

   <b>accept</b>
   <b>addChild</b>
   <b>setNodeValue</b>
   <b>getNodeValue</b>
   <b>traverse</b>
