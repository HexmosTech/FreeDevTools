</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::Roles - Role based authorization for Catalyst based on
       Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Catalyst qw/
               Authentication
               Authorization::Roles
           /;

           sub delete : Local {
               my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

               $c-&gt;assert_user_roles( qw/admin/ ); # only admins can delete

               $c-&gt;model("Foo")-&gt;delete_it();
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Role based access control is very simple: every user has a list of roles, which that user is allowed to
       assume, and every restricted part of the app makes an assertion about the necessary roles.

       With "assert_user_roles", if the user is a member in <b>all</b> of the required roles access is granted.
       Otherwise, access is denied. With "assert_any_user_role" it is enough that the user is a member in <b>one</b>
       role.

       There are alternative approaches to do this on a per action basis, see Catalyst::ActionRole::ACL.

       For example, if you have a CRUD application, for every mutating action you probably want to check that
       the user is allowed to edit. To do this, create an editor role, and add that role to every user who is
       allowed to edit.

           sub edit : Local {
               my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
               $c-&gt;assert_user_roles( qw/editor/ );
               $c-&gt;model("TheModel")-&gt;make_changes();
           }

       When this plugin checks the roles of a user it will first see if the user supports the self check method.

       When this is not supported the list of roles is extracted from the user using the "roles" method.

       When this is supported, the "check_roles" method will be used to delegate the role check to the user
       class. Classes like the one provided with iCatalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class optimize the
       check this way.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       assert_user_roles [ $user ], @roles
           Checks  that  the  user  (as  supplied  by  the  first  argument, or, if omitted, "$c-&gt;user") has the
           specified roles.

           If for any reason ("$c-&gt;user" is not defined, the user is missing a role, etc) the  check  fails,  an
           error is thrown.

           You can either catch these errors with an eval, or clean them up in your "end" action.

       check_user_roles [ $user ], @roles
           Takes  the  same  args  as  "assert_user_roles", and performs the same check, but instead of throwing
           errors returns a boolean value.

       assert_any_user_role [ $user ], @roles
           Checks that the user (as supplied by the first argument, or, if omitted, "$c-&gt;user") has at least one
           of the specified roles.

           Other than that, works like "assert_user_roles".

       check_any_user_role [ $user ], @roles
           Takes the same args as "assert_any_user_role", and performs the same check, but instead  of  throwing
           errors returns a boolean value.
