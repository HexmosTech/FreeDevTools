       UR::Env - Environment variables that control UR behavior

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       UR uses several environment variables to change its behavior or provide additional debugging information.

       UR_STACK_DUMP_ON_DIE &lt;bool&gt;
           When  true,  has  the  effect of turning any <b>die()</b> into a Carp::confess, meaning a stack dump will be
           printed after the die message.

       UR_STACK_DUMP_ON_WARN &lt;bool&gt;
           When true, has the effect of turning any <b>warn()</b> into a Carp::cluck, meaning  a  stack  dump  will  be
           printed after the warn message.

       UR_CONTEXT_ROOT &lt;string&gt;
           The  name  of  the  Root  context  to  instantiate  when  the  program  initializes.   The default is
           UR::Context::DefaultRoot.  Other Root Contexts can be used, for  example,  to  connect  to  alternate
           databases when running in test mode.

       UR_CONTEXT_BASE &lt;string&gt;
           This  value  only changes in a sub-process which goes to its parent process for object I/O instead of
           the root (which is the default value for the base context in an application).

       UR_CONTEXT_CACHE_SIZE_HIGHWATER &lt;integer&gt;
           Set   the   object   count   highwater   mark   for   the   object   cache    pruner.     See    also
           "object_cache_size_highwater" in UR::Context

       UR_CONTEXT_CACHE_SIZE_LOWWATER &lt;integer&gt;
           Set    the    object    count    lowwater   mark   for   the   object   cache   pruner.    See   also
           "object_cache_size_lowwater" in UR::Context

       UR_DEBUG_OBJECT_RELEASE &lt;bool&gt;
           When true, messages will be printed to STDERR whenever objects are removed  from  the  object  cache,
           such  as when the object pruner marks them for removal, when they are garbage collected, unloaded, or
           deleted.

       UR_DEBUG_OBJECT_RELEASE &lt;bool&gt;
           When true, messages will be printed to STDERR whenever the object pruner finishes its work, and  show
           how many objects of each class were marked for removal.

       UR_CONTEXT_MONITOR_QUERY &lt;integer&gt;
           When  true  (non-zero), messages will be printed as the Context satisfies queries, such as when <b>get()</b>
           is called on a class, or while processing an iterator created through SomeClass-&gt;create_iterator  and
           iterator-&gt;<b>next()</b>.  If the value is 1, then only queries about Non-UR classes are printed.  If 2, then
           all queries' information is printed.

       UR_DBI_MONITOR_SQL &lt;bool&gt;
           If  this  is true, most interactions with data sources such as connecting, disconnecting and querying
           will print messages to STDERR.  Same as "UR::DBI-&gt;monitor_sql()".  Note  that  this  affects  non-DBI
           data sources as well, such as file-based data sources, which will render file I/O information instead
           of SQL.

       UR_DBI_SUMMARIZE_SQL &lt;bool&gt;
           If  true, a report will be printed to STDERR as the program finishes about what SQL queries have been
           done during the program's execution, and how many times they were executed.  This is  helpful  during
           optimization.

       UR_DBI_MONITOR_EVERY_FETCH &lt;bool&gt;
           Used  in conjunction with UR_DBI_MONITOR_SQL, tells the data sources to also print messages to STDERR
           for each row fetched from the underlying data source. Same as "UR::DBI-&gt;monitor_every_fetch()".

       UR_DBI_DUMP_STACK_ON_CONNECT &lt;bool&gt;
           Print  a  message  to  STDERR  only  when  connecting  to  an  underlying  data  source.    Same   as
           "UR::DBI-&gt;dump_stack_on_connect()"

       UR_DBI_EXPLAIN_SQL_MATCH &lt;string&gt;
           If the query to a data source matches the given string (interpreted as a regex), then it will attempt
           to   do   an   "explain   plan"   and   print  the  results  before  executing  the  query.  Same  as
           "UR::DBI-&gt;explain_sql_match()"

       UR_DBI_EXPLAIN_SQL_SLOW &lt;float&gt;
           If the time between a prepare and the first fetch of a query is  longer  than  the  given  number  of
           seconds,    then   it   will   do   an   "explain   plan"   and   print   the   results.    Same   as
           "UR::DBI-&gt;explain_sql_slow()"

       UR_DBI_EXPLAIN_SQL_CALLSTACK &lt;bool&gt;
           Used in conjunction with UR_DBI_EXPLAIN_SQL_MATCH and UR_DBI_EXPLAIN_SQL_SLOW, prints a  stack  trace
           with Carp::longmess.  Same as "UR::DBI-&gt;explain_sql_callstack()"

       UR_DBI_MONITOR_DML &lt;bool&gt;
           Like  UR_DBI_MONITOR_SQL,  but  only prints information during data-altering statements, like INSERT,
           UPDATE or DELETE.  Same as "UR::DBI-&gt;monitor_dml()"

       UR_DBI_NO_COMMIT &lt;bool&gt;
           If true, data source commits will be ignored.  Note that saving still occurs.   If  you  are  working
           with  a  RDBMS  database,  this means During UR::Context-&gt;<b>commit()</b>, the insert, update and delete SQL
           statements will be issued, but the changes will not be  committed.   Useful  for  testing.   Same  as
           "UR::DBI-&gt;no_commit()"

       UR_USE_DUMMY_AUTOGENERATED_IDS &lt;bool&gt;
           If  true,  objects  created  without ID params will use a special algorithm to generate IDs.  Objects
           with these special IDs will never be saved to  a  data  source.   Useful  during  testing.   Same  as
           "UR::DataSource-&gt;use_dummy_autogenerated_ids"

       UR_USED_LIBS
           If true, prints a message to STDERR with the contents of @INC just before the program exits.

       UR_USED_MODS
           If  true,  prints a message to STDERR with the keys of %INC just before the program exits.  This will
           be a list of what modules had been loaded during the life of the program.  If UR_USED_MODS is greater
           than 1, then it will show the key/value pairs of %INC, which will  show  the  path  each  module  was
           loaded from.
