</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Eval::TypeTiny - utility to evaluate a string of Perl code in a clean environment

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       This module is covered by the Type-Tiny stability policy.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is used by Type::Tiny to compile coderefs from strings of Perl code, and hashrefs of
       variables to close over.

   <b>Functions</b>
       By default this module exports one function, which works much like the similarly named function from
       Eval::Closure:

       "eval_closure(source =&gt; $source, environment =&gt; \%env, %opt)"

       Other functions can be imported on request:

       "set_subname( $fully_qualified_name, $coderef )"
           Works like the similarly named function from Sub::Util, but will fallback to doing nothing if neither
           Sub::Util  nor  Sub::Name  are  available.  Also will cowardly refuse the set the name of a coderef a
           second time if it's already named it.

       "type_to_coderef( $type, %options )"
           Turns a Type::Tiny object into a coderef, suitable for installing into a symbol  table  to  create  a
           function   like   "ArrayRef"  or  "Int".   (Actually  should  work  for  any  object  which  provides
           "is_parameterizable", "parameterize", and "qualified_name" methods, such as Type::Coercion.)

           $options{post_method} can be a string of Perl indicating a method to  call  on  the  type  constraint
           before returning it. For example '-&gt;moose_type'.

           $options{description} can be a description of the coderef which may be shown in stack traces, etc.

           The coderef will be named using "set_subname" unless $options{anonymous} is true.

           If  $type  is  undef,  then  it  is assumed that the type constraint hasn't been defined yet but will
           later, yet you still want a function now.  $options{type_library}  and  $options{type_name}  will  be
           used to find the type constraint when the function gets called.

   <b>Constants</b>
       The following constants may be exported, but are not by default.

       "HAS_LEXICAL_SUBS"
           Boolean  indicating whether Eval::TypeTiny has support for lexical subs.  (This feature requires Perl
           5.18.)

       "ALIAS_IMPLEMENTATION"
           Returns a string indicating what implementation of "alias =&gt; 1" is being  used.  Eval::TypeTiny  will
           automatically   choose   the   best  implementation.   This  constant  can  be  matched  against  the
           "IMPLEMENTAION_*" constants.

       "IMPLEMENTATION_NATIVE"
           If "ALIAS_IMPLEMENTATION eq IMPLEMENTATION_NATIVE" then Eval::TypeTiny is currently using Perl 5.22's
           native alias feature. This requires Perl 5.22.

       "IMPLEMENTATION_DEVEL_LEXALIAS"
           If "ALIAS_IMPLEMENTATION eq IMPLEMENTATION_DEVEL_LEXALIAS" then  Eval::TypeTiny  is  currently  using
           Devel::LexAlias to provide aliases.

       "IMPLEMENTATION_PADWALKER"
           If   "ALIAS_IMPLEMENTATION  eq  IMPLEMENTATION_PADWALKER"  then  Eval::TypeTiny  is  currently  using
           PadWalker to provide aliases.

       "IMPLEMENTATION_TIE"
           If  "ALIAS_IMPLEMENTATION  eq  IMPLEMENTATION_TIE"  then  Eval::TypeTiny  is   using   the   fallback
           implementation  of aliases using "tie". This is the slowest implementation, and may cause problems in
           certain edge cases, like trying to alias already-tied variables, but it's the only way  to  implement
           "alias =&gt; 1" without a recent version of Perl or one of the two optional modules mentioned above.

       "NICE_PROTOTYPES"
           If  this  is true, then type_to_coderef will give parameterizable type constraints the slightly nicer
           prototype of "(;$)" instead of the default "(;@)". This allows constructs like:

              ArrayRef[Int] | HashRef[Int]

           ... to "just work".

</pre><h4><b>EVALUATION</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The evaluation is performed in the presence of strict, but the absence of warnings. (This is different to
       Eval::Closure which enables warnings for compiled closures.)

       The feature pragma is not active in the evaluation environment, so the following will not work:

          use feature qw(say);
          use Eval::TypeTiny qw(eval_closure);

          my $say_all = eval_closure(
             source =&gt; 'sub { say for @_ }',
          );
          $say_all-&gt;("Hello", "World");

       The feature pragma does not "carry over" into the stringy eval.  It  is  of  course  possible  to  import
       pragmas into the evaluated string as part of the string itself:

          use Eval::TypeTiny qw(eval_closure);

          my $say_all = eval_closure(
             source =&gt; 'sub { use feature qw(say); say for @_ }',
          );
          $say_all-&gt;("Hello", "World");
