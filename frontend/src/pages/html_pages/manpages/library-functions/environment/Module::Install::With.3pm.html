       Module::Install::With - find environnement for Module::Install

   <b>interactive</b>
       The "interactive" function tests for an install that has a user present (or at least, one in which it is
       reasonable for us to present prompts and other similar types of things).

       Returns true if in an interactive environment, or false otherwise.

   <b>automated_testing</b>
       Are we currently running in an automated testing environment, such as CPAN Testers.

       This is primarily a cleaner and more human-readable equivalent of checking $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING}
       yourself, but may be improved in line with best practices at a later date.

   <b>release_testing</b>
       Are we currently running in an release testing environment. That is, are we in the process of running in
       a potential highly-intensive and high dependency bloat testing process prior to packaging a module for
       release.

       This is primarily a cleaner and more human-readable equivalent of checking $ENV{RELEASE_TESTING}
       yourself, but may be improved in line with best practices at a later date.

   <b>win32</b>
       The "win32" function tests if the Makefile.PL is currently running in a native Microsoft Windows Perl,
       such as ActivePerl or Strawberry Perl.

       This is primarily a cleaner and more human-readable equivalent of checking "$^O eq 'MSWin32'" yourself,
       but may be improved in line with best practices at a later date.

   <b>winlike</b>
       The "winlike" function tests if the Makefile.PL is currently running in a Microsoft Windows Perl, under
       either cygwin or a native Win32 Perl.

       This is primarily a cleaner and more human-readable equivalent of checking "$^O eq 'MSWin32' or $^O eq
       'cygwin'"yourself, but may be improved in line with best practices at a later date.
