         use Net::DBus;

         # Find the most appropriate bus
         my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;find;

         # ... or explicitly go for the session bus

         my $manager = $hal-&gt;get_object("/org/freedesktop/Hal/Manager",
                                        "org.freedesktop.Hal.Manager");

         # List devices

         my $service = $bus-&gt;export_service("org.example.Jukebox");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Net::DBus provides a Perl API for the DBus message system.  The DBus Perl interface is currently
       operating against the 0.32 development version of DBus, but should work with later versions too,
       providing the API changes have not been too drastic.

       Users of this package are either typically, service providers in which case the Net::DBus::Service and
       Net::DBus::Object modules are of most relevance, or are client consumers, in which case
       Net::DBus::RemoteService and Net::DBus::RemoteObject are of most relevance.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;find(%params);
           Search  for  the most appropriate bus to connect to and return a connection to it. The heuristic used
           for the search is

             - If DBUS_STARTER_BUS_TYPE is set to 'session' attach
               to the session bus

             - Else If DBUS_STARTER_BUS_TYPE is set to 'system' attach
               to the system bus

             - Else If DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS is set attach to the
               session bus

             - Else attach to the system bus

           The optional "params" hash can contain be used to specify connection options. The only support option
           at this time is "nomainloop" which prevents the bus from being automatically  attached  to  the  main
           Net::DBus::Reactor event loop.

       my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;system(%params);
           Return  a  handle  for  the  system  message  bus. Note that the system message bus is locked down by
           default, so unless appropriate access control rules are added in /etc/dbus/system.d/, an  application
           may access services, but won't be able to export services.

           The optional "params" hash can be used to specify the following options:

           nomainloop
               If  true, prevents the bus from being automatically attached to the main Net::DBus::Reactor event
               loop.

           private
               If true, the socket opened is private; any  existing  socket  will  be  ignored  and  any  future
               attempts to open the same bus will return a different existing socket or open a fresh one.

       my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;session(%params);
           Return a handle for the session message bus.

           The optional "params" hash can be used to specify the following options:

           nomainloop
               If  true, prevents the bus from being automatically attached to the main Net::DBus::Reactor event
               loop.

           private
               If true, the socket opened is private; any  existing  socket  will  be  ignored  and  any  future
               attempts to open the same bus will return a different existing socket or open a fresh one.

       my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;test(%params);
           Returns  a  handle  for  a  virtual  bus  for  use  in unit tests. This bus does not make any network
           connections, but rather has an in-memory message  pipeline.  Consult  Net::DBus::Test::MockConnection
           for further details of how to use this special bus.

       my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;new($address, %params);
           Return  a  connection  to a specific message bus.  The $address parameter must contain the address of
           the  message  bus  to  connect  to.  An  example  address  for  a  session  bus   might   look   like
           "unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-PBFyyuUiVb,guid=191e0a43c3efc222e0818be556d67500",  while  one  for a system
           bus would look like "unix:/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket".  The optional "params" hash  can  contain
           be  used  to  specify  connection options. The only support option at this time is "nomainloop" which
           prevents the bus from being automatically attached to the main Net::DBus::Reactor event loop.

       my $connection = $bus-&gt;get_connection;
           Return a handle to the underlying, low level connection object associated with this bus. The returned
           object will be an instance of the Net::DBus::Binding::Bus class. This method is not intended for  use
           by  (most!)  application developers, so if you don't understand what this is for, then you don't need
           to be calling it!

       my $service = $bus-&gt;get_service($name);
           Retrieves a handle for the remote service identified by the service name $name. The  returned  object
           will be an instance of the Net::DBus::RemoteService class.

       my $service = $bus-&gt;export_service($name);
           Registers  a  service  with  the  bus,  returning  a handle to the service. The returned object is an
           instance of the Net::DBus::Service class.

           When $name is not specified or is "undef" then returned handle to the service is identified  only  by
           the unique name of client's connection to the bus.

       my $object = $bus-&gt;get_bus_object;
           Retrieves   a   handle   to   the  bus  object,  "/org/freedesktop/DBus",  provided  by  the  service
           "org.freedesktop.DBus". The returned object is an instance of Net::DBus::RemoteObject

       my $name = $bus-&gt;get_unique_name;
           Retrieves the unique name of this client's connection to the bus.

       my $name = $bus-&gt;get_service_owner($service);
           Retrieves the unique name of the client  on  the  bus  owning  the  service  named  by  the  $service
           parameter.

       my $timeout = $bus-&gt;timeout(60 * 1000);
           Sets  or  retrieves  the  timeout  value  which  will  be  used for DBus requests belongs to this bus
           connection. The timeout should be specified in milliseconds, with the default value being 60 seconds.

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>TYPING</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       These methods are not usually used, since most services provide introspection data to inform  clients  of
       their  data  typing requirements. If introspection data is incomplete, however, it may be necessary for a
       client to mark values with specific data types. In such a case, the following methods can be  used.  They
       are  not,  however,  exported by default so must be requested at import time by specifying 'use Net::DBus
       qw(:typing)'

       $typed_value = dbus_int16($value);
           Mark a value as being a signed, 16-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_uint16($value);
           Mark a value as being an unsigned, 16-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_int32($value);
           Mark a value as being a signed, 32-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_uint32($value);
           Mark a value as being an unsigned, 32-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_int64($value);
           Mark a value as being an unsigned, 64-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_uint64($value);
           Mark a value as being an unsigned, 64-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_double($value);
           Mark a value as being a double precision IEEE floating point.

       $typed_value = dbus_byte($value);
           Mark a value as being an unsigned, byte.

       $typed_value = dbus_string($value);
           Mark a value as being a UTF-8 string. This is not usually required since 'string' is the default data
           type for any Perl scalar value.

       $typed_value = dbus_signature($value);
           Mark a value as being a UTF-8 string, whose contents is a valid type signature

       $typed_value = dbus_object_path($value);
           Mark a value as being a UTF-8 string, whose contents is a valid object path.

       $typed_value = dbus_boolean($value);
           Mark a value as being an boolean

       $typed_value = dbus_array($value);
           Mark a value as being an array

       $typed_value = dbus_struct($value);
           Mark a value as being a structure

       $typed_value = dbus_dict($value);
           Mark a value as being a dictionary

       $typed_value = dbus_variant($value);
           Mark a value as being a variant

       $typed_value = dbus_unix_fd($value);
           Mark a value as being a unix file descriptor
