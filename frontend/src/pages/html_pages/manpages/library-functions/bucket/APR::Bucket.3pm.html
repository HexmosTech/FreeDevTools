         my $ba = $c-&gt;bucket_alloc;

         $b1 = APR::Bucket-&gt;new($ba, "aaa");

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       "APR::Bucket" allows you to create, manipulate and delete APR buckets.

       You will probably find the various insert methods confusing, the tip is to read the function right to
       left. The following code sample helps to visualize the operations:

         my $bb = APR::Brigade-&gt;new($r-&gt;pool, $ba);
         my $d1 = APR::Bucket-&gt;new($ba, "d1");
         my $d2 = APR::Bucket-&gt;new($ba, "d2");
         my $f1 = APR::Bucket::flush_create($ba);
         my $f2 = APR::Bucket::flush_create($ba);
         my $e1 = APR::Bucket::eos_create($ba);
                                  # head-&gt;tail
         $bb-&gt;insert_head(  $d1); # head-&gt;d1-&gt;tail
         $d1-&gt;insert_after( $d2); # head-&gt;d1-&gt;d2-&gt;tail
         $d2-&gt;insert_before($f1); # head-&gt;d1-&gt;f1-&gt;d2-&gt;tail
         $d2-&gt;insert_after( $f2); # head-&gt;d1-&gt;f1-&gt;d2-&gt;f2-&gt;tail
         $bb-&gt;insert_tail(  $e1); # head-&gt;d1-&gt;f1-&gt;d2-&gt;f2-&gt;e1-&gt;tail

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       "APR::Bucket" provides the following functions and/or methods:

   <b>"delete"</b>
       Tell the bucket to remove itself from the bucket brigade it belongs to, and destroy itself.

         $bucket-&gt;delete();

       obj: $bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

       If the bucket is not attached to any bucket brigade then this operation just destroys the bucket.

       "delete" is a convenience wrapper, internally doing:

         $b-&gt;remove;
         $b-&gt;destroy;

       Examples:

       Assuming  that  $bb  already  exists  and filled with buckets, replace the existing data buckets with new
       buckets with upcased data;

         for (my $b = $bb-&gt;first; $b; $b = $bb-&gt;next($b)) {
            if ($b-&gt;read(my $data)) {
                 my $nb = APR::Bucket-&gt;new($bb-&gt;bucket_alloc, uc $data);
                 $b-&gt;insert_before($nb);
                 $b-&gt;delete;
                 $b = $nb;
             }
         }

   <b>"destroy"</b>
       Free the resources used by a bucket. If multiple buckets refer to the same resource it is freed when  the
       last one goes away.

         $bucket-&gt;destroy();

       obj: $bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

       A bucket needs to be destroyed if it was removed from a bucket brigade, to avoid memory leak.

       If a bucket is linked to a bucket brigade, it needs to be removed from it, before it can be destroyed.

       Usually instead of calling:

         $b-&gt;remove;
         $b-&gt;destroy;

       it's better to call "delete" which does exactly that.

   <b>"eos_create"</b>
       Create an <u>EndOfStream</u> bucket.

         $b = APR::Bucket::eos_create($ba);

       arg1: $ba ( "APR::BucketAlloc object" )
           The freelist from which this bucket should be allocated

       ret: $b ( "APR::Bucket object" )
           The new bucket

       since: 2.0.00

       This  bucket  type  indicates  that there is no more data coming from down the filter stack.  All filters
       should flush any buffered data at this point.

       Example:

         use APR::Bucket ();
         use Apache2::Connection ();
         my $ba = $c-&gt;bucket_alloc;
         my $eos_b = APR::Bucket::eos_create($ba);

   <b>"flush_create"</b>
       Create a flush bucket.

         $b = APR::Bucket::flush_create($ba);

       arg1: $ba ( "APR::BucketAlloc object" )
           The freelist from which this bucket should be allocated

       ret: $b ( "APR::Bucket object" )
           The new bucket

       since: 2.0.00

       This bucket type indicates that filters should flush their data.  There is no guarantee  that  they  will
       flush it, but this is the best we can do.

   <b>"insert_after"</b>
       Insert a list of buckets after a specified bucket

         $after_bucket-&gt;insert_after($add_bucket);

       obj: $after_bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
           The bucket to insert after

       arg1: $add_bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
           The  buckets  to  insert.  It  says  buckets,  since $add_bucket may have more buckets attached after
           itself.

       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

   <b>"insert_before"</b>
       Insert a list of buckets before a specified bucket

         $before_bucket-&gt;insert_before($add_bucket);

       obj: $before_bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
           The bucket to insert before

       arg1: $add_bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
           The buckets to insert. It says buckets, since  $add_bucket  may  have  more  buckets  attached  after
           itself.

       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

   <b>"is_eos"</b>
       Determine if a bucket is an EOS bucket

         $ret = $bucket-&gt;is_eos();

       obj: $bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: $ret ( boolean )
       since: 2.0.00

   <b>"is_flush"</b>
       Determine if a bucket is a FLUSH bucket

         $ret = $bucket-&gt;is_flush();

       obj: $bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: $ret ( boolean )
       since: 2.0.00

   <b>"length"</b>
       Get the length of the data in the bucket.

         $len = $b-&gt;length;

       obj: $b ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: $len ( integer )
           If the length is unknown, $len value will be -1.

       since: 2.0.00

   <b>"new"</b>
       Create a new bucket and initialize it with data:

         $nb = APR::Bucket-&gt;new($ba, $data);
         $nb =          $b-&gt;new($ba, $data);
         $nb = APR::Bucket-&gt;new($ba, $data, $offset);
         $nb = APR::Bucket-&gt;new($ba, $data, $offset, $len);

       obj: $b ( "APR::Bucket object or class" )
       arg1: $ba ( "APR::BucketAlloc object" )
       arg2: $data ( string )
           The data to initialize with.

           <b>Important:</b>  in  order  to avoid unnecessary data copying the variable is stored in the bucket object.
           That means that if you modify $data after passing it to new() you will modify the data in the  bucket
           as well. To avoid that pass to new() a copy which you won't modify.

       opt arg3: $offset ( number )
           Optional offset inside $data. Default: 0.

       opt arg4: $len ( number )
           Optional partial length to read.

           If $offset is specified, then:

             length $buffer - $offset;

           will be used. Otherwise the default is to use:

             length $buffer;

       ret: $nb ( "APR::Bucket object" )
           a newly created bucket object

       since: 2.0.00

       Examples:

       •   Create a new bucket using a whole string:

             use APR::Bucket ();
             my $data = "my data";
             my $b = APR::Bucket-&gt;new($ba, $data);

           now the bucket contains the string <u>'my</u> <u>data'</u>.

       •   Create a new bucket using a sub-string:

             use APR::Bucket ();
             my $data   = "my data";
             my $offset = 3;
             my $b = APR::Bucket-&gt;new($ba, $data, $offset);

           now the bucket contains the string <u>'data'</u>.

       •   Create a new bucket not using the whole length and starting from an offset:

             use APR::Bucket ();
             my $data   = "my data";
             my $offset = 3;
             my $len    = 3;
             my $b = APR::Bucket-&gt;new($ba, $data, $offset, $len);

           now the bucket contains the string <u>'dat'</u>.

   <b>"read"</b>
       Read the data from the bucket.

         $len = $b-&gt;read($buffer);
         $len = $b-&gt;read($buffer, $block);

       obj: $b ( "APR::Bucket object" )
           The bucket to read from

       arg1: $buffer ( SCALAR )
           The buffer to fill. All previous data will be lost.

       opt arg2: $block ( "APR::Const :read_type constant" )
           optional reading mode constant.

           By default the read is blocking, via "APR::Const::BLOCK_READ constant".

       ret: $len ( number )
           How many bytes were actually read

           $buffer  gets  populated  with  the string that is read. It will contain an empty string if there was
           nothing to read.

       since: 2.0.00
       excpt: "APR::Error"

       It's important to know that certain bucket types (e.g. file bucket), may perform a split and insert extra
       buckets following the current one. Therefore never call "$b-&gt;remove", before calling "$b-&gt;read",  or  you
       may lose data.

       Examples:

       Blocking read:

         my $len = $b-&gt;read(my $buffer);

       Non-blocking read:

         use APR::Const -compile 'NONBLOCK_READ';
         my $len = $b-&gt;read(my $buffer, APR::Const::NONBLOCK_READ);

   <b>"remove"</b>
       Tell the bucket to remove itself from the bucket brigade it belongs to.

         $bucket-&gt;remove();

       obj: $bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

       If the bucket is not attached to any bucket brigade then this operation doesn't do anything.

       When  the  bucket is removed, it's not not destroyed. Usually this is done in order to move the bucket to
       another bucket brigade. Or to copy the data way before destroying the bucket.  If the bucket wasn't moved
       to another bucket brigade it must be destroyed.

       Examples:

       Assuming that $bb1 already exists and filled with buckets, move every odd bucket number to $bb2 and every
       even to $bb3:

         my $bb2 = APR::Brigade-&gt;new($c-&gt;pool, $c-&gt;bucket_alloc);
         my $bb3 = APR::Brigade-&gt;new($c-&gt;pool, $c-&gt;bucket_alloc);
         my $count = 0;
         while (my $bucket = $bb-&gt;first) {
             $count++;
             $bucket-&gt;remove;
             $count % 2
                 ? $bb2-&gt;insert_tail($bucket)
                 : $bb3-&gt;insert_tail($bucket);
         }

   <b>"setaside"</b>
       Ensure the bucket's data lasts at least as long as the given pool:

         my $status = $b-&gt;setaside($pool);

       obj: $b ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       arg1: $pool ( "APR::Pool object" )
       ret: ( "APR::Const status constant" )
           On success, "APR::Const::SUCCESS" is returned. Otherwise a failure code is returned.

       excpt: "APR::Error"
           when your code deals only with mod_perl buckets, you don't have to ask for the return value. If  this
           method is called in the "VOID" context, i.e.:

             $b-&gt;setaside($pool);

           mod_perl   will   do   the   error   checking  on  your  behalf,  and  if  the  return  code  is  not
           "APR::Const::SUCCESS", an "APR::Error exception" will be thrown.

           However if your code doesn't know which bucket types it may need to setaside, you may want  to  check
           the  return  code  and  deal  with  any  errors.  For  example  one  of  the  possible error codes is
           "APR::Const::ENOTIMPL". As of this writing the pipe and socket buckets  can't  setaside(),  in  which
           case you may want to look at the ap_save_brigade() implementation.

       since: 2.0.00

       Usually setaside is called by certain output filters, in order to buffer socket writes of smaller buckets
       into  a  single  write. This method works on all bucket types (not only the mod_perl bucket type), but as
       explained in the exceptions section, not all bucket types implement this method.

       When a mod_perl bucket is setaside, its data is detached from the original perl scalar and copied into  a
       pool bucket. That allows downstream filters to deal with the data originally owned by a Perl interpreter,
       making it possible for that interpreter to go away and do other things, or be destroyed.

   <b>"type"</b>
       Get the type of the data in the bucket.

         $type = $b-&gt;type;

       obj: $b ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: $type ( "APR::BucketType object" )
       since: 2.0.00

       You need to invoke "APR::BucketType" methods to access the data.

       Example:

       Create a flush bucket and read its type's name:

         use APR::Bucket ();
         use APR::BucketType ();
         my $b = APR::Bucket::flush_create($ba);
         my $type = $b-&gt;type;
         my $type_name =  $type-&gt;name; # FLUSH

       The type name will be <u>'FLUSH'</u> in this example.

</pre><h4><b>Unsupported</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       "APR::Socket"  also provides auto-generated Perl interface for a few other methods which aren't tested at
       the moment and therefore their API is a subject to change. These methods will be  finalized  later  as  a
       need  arises.  If  you  want  to  rely  on  any  of the following methods please contact the the mod_perl
       development mailing list so we can help each other take the steps necessary to shift  the  method  to  an
       officially supported API.

   <b>"data"</b>
         $data = $b-&gt;data;

       Gives  a  C  pointer  to the address of the data in the bucket. I can't see what use can be done of it in
       Perl.

       obj: $b ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: $data ( C pointer )
       since: subject to change

   <b>"start"</b>
         $start = $b-&gt;start;

       It gives the offset to when a new bucket is created with a non-zero offset value:

         my $b = APR::Bucket-&gt;new($ba, $data, $offset, $len);

       So if the offset was 3. $start will be 3 too.

       I fail to see what it can be useful for to the end user (it's mainly used internally).

       obj: $b ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: $start ( offset number )
       since: subject to change
