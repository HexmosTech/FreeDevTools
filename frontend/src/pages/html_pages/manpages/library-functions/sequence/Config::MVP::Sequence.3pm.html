</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Config::MVP::Sequence - an ordered set of named configuration sections

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.200013

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A Config::MVP::Sequence is an ordered set of configuration sections, each of which has a name unique
       within the sequence.

       For the most part, you can just consult Config::MVP to understand what this class is and how it's used.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>is_finalized</b>
       This attribute is true if the sequence has been marked finalized, which will prevent any changes (via
       methods like "add_section" or "delete_section").  It can be set with the "finalize" method.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>add_section</b>
         $sequence-&gt;add_section($section);

       This method adds the given section to the end of the sequence.  If the sequence already contains a
       section with the same name as the new section, an exception will be raised.

   <b>delete_section</b>
         my $deleted_section = $sequence-&gt;delete_section( $name );

       This method removes a section from the sequence and returns the removed section.  If no section existed,
       the method returns false.

   <b>section_named</b>
         my $section = $sequence-&gt;section_named( $name );

       This method returns the section with the given name, if one exists in the sequence.  If no such section
       exists, the method returns false.

   <b>section_names</b>
         my @names = $sequence-&gt;section_names;

       This method returns a list of the names of the sections, in order.

   <b>sections</b>
         my @sections = $sequence-&gt;sections;

       This method returns the section objects, in order.
