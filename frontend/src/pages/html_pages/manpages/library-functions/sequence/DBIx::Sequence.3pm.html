</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DBIx::Sequence - A simple SQL92 ID generator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use DBIx::Sequence;

         my $sequence = new DBIx::Sequence({ dbh =&gt; $dbh });
         my $next_id = $sequence-&gt;Next('dataset');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is intended to give easier portability to Perl database application by providing a database
       independant unique ID generator. This way, an application developer is not bound to use his database's
       SEQUENCE or auto_increment thus making his application portable on multiple database environnements.

       This module implements a simple Spin Locker mechanism and is garanteed to return a unique value every
       time it is called, even with concurrent processes. It uses your database for its state storage with ANSI
       SQL92 compliant SQL. All SQL queries inside DBIx::Sequence are pre cached and very efficient especially
       under mod_perl.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
               perl Makefile.PL
               make
               make test
               make install

       Note:

       If you decide to run extended tests for the module, you will have to provide the make test with a DSN
       (connect string) to your database (dbi:Driver:db;host=hostname) and a valid username/password combination
       for a privileged user.

       DBIx::Sequence uses 2 tables for its operation, namely the dbix_sequence_state and the
       dbix_sequence_release tables. Those tables will be created if you run extended tests, if not you will
       need to create them yourself.

               dbix_sequence_state:
               | dataset  | <a href="../man50/varchar.50.html">varchar</a>(50) |
               | state_id | <a href="../man11/int.11.html">int</a>(11)     |

               dbix_sequence_release:
               | dataset     | <a href="../man50/varchar.50.html">varchar</a>(50) |
               | released_id | <a href="../man11/int.11.html">int</a>(11)     |

       Those table names are overloadable at your convenience, see the OVERLOADING section for details.

</pre><h4><b>BASIC</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The basic usage of this module is to generate a unique ID to replace the use of your database's SEQUENCE
       of auto_increment field.

   <b>INIT</b>
       First, you need to create the sequence object:

               use DBIx::Sequence;
               my $sequence = new DBIx::Sequence({
                                                       db_user =&gt; 'scott',
                                                       db_pw =&gt; 'tiger',
                                                       db_dsn =&gt; 'dbi:mysql:scottdb',
                                                       allow_id_reuse =&gt; 1,
                                                       });

       DBIx::Sequence can be used to manage multiple sets of ID's (perhaps you could have one dataset per table,
       or one and only one dataset). This permits you to handle multiple applications with the same sequence
       class.  The dataset is normally simply a token string that represents your ID set. If the dataset does
       not exists, DBIx::Sequence will create automagically for you. No special steps are involved in the
       creation of a dataset.

       The arguments contains the database informations, db_user, db_pw and db_dsn and are stored in a hash
       reference.

       At this point, the object has pre cached all of the SQL that will be used to generate the spin locker
       race. It is normally a good idea to have a shared sequence object (especially) under mod_perl to save the
       prepare overhead.  The 'allow_id_reuse' argument can be passed to the constructor to either allow the use
       of the <b>Release()</b> or deny it. (True value makes it allowed)

   <b>GETTING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>NEXT</b> <b>ID</b>
       To get the next id, you simpy have to use the <b>Next()</b> method of your sequence while specifying the dataset
       you are getting the next id for.

               my $next_id = $sequence-&gt;Next($dataset);

   <b>RELEASING</b> <b>ID'S.</b>
       Generated ID's can be _explicitly_ released in your application.  When an ID is released, the sequence
       will be able to give this id back to you throught the <b>Next()</b> method.

       This is how it is done:

               $sequence-&gt;Release($dataset, $id);

       Note:

       You must use release only when you are _CERTAIN_ that your ID is not used anymore and that you want it to
       be recycled. The Spin Locking mechanism will also take place on released id's to ensure that no two
       processes can get the same ID.

   <b>PERMANENTLY</b> <b>REMOVING</b> <b>A</b> <b>DATASET</b>
       To make DBIx::Sequence forget about an existing dataset, you need to use the <b>Delete_Dataset()</b> method.

               $sequence-&gt;Delete_Dataset($dataset);

       This will clear all state and existence for this dataset and will also clear it's released id's. Note
       that if your application still uses this dataset, it will be automatically recreated blank.

   <b>BOOTSTRAPPING</b> <b>A</b> <b>DATASET</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>EXISTING</b> <b>DATA</b>
       It is possible to sync the state of a DBIx::Sequence dataset by using the <b>Bootstrap()</b> method.

               $sequence-&gt;Bootstrap('my_dataset','my_bootstrap_table','my_primary_field');

       <b>Bootstrap()</b> takes 3 arguments.

       •  The dataset to bootstrap

       •  The table from wich you will bootstrap

       •  The field in the bootstrap table that will be used to bootstrap the dataset.

       Bootstrap  will  then sync up the DBIx::Sequence's state with the maximum id of the 'my_primary_field' in
       'my_bootstrap_table'. The bootstrap field must be a numeric field as you can suspect.  The  SQL  function
       <b>MAX()</b> will be called on it during the bootstrap process.

       Note:  The bootstrap method _can_ be used at runtime since it will initiate a race for updating the value
       thus following the same algorithm. It is recommended though  that  you  use  <b>Bootstrap()</b>  when  no  other
       concurrent processes are requesting id's.

   <b>OVERLOADING</b>
       It  is  possible  to  create  an  overloaded  class  of  DBIx::Sequence.   This  permits  you to create a
       DBIx::Sequence that has different properties than the orignal one. The only  thing  you  really  have  to
       overload to modify the behaviour of DBIx::Sequence are some constants:

       •  STATE_TABLE : Defines the table used by DBIx::Sequence to store dataset's states.

       •  RELEASE_TABLE : Defines the table used by DBIx::Sequence to store released id's.

       •  COLUMN_PREFIX : A string to be prepended to every column in the internal SQL statements.

       •  DEFAULT_INIT_VALUE : Value used to initialize a dataset when it is first created.

       •  DEFAULT_ALLOW_ID_REUSE  :  When  set  to true, will allow the use of <b>Release()</b> if not specified in the
          constructor. (allow_id_reuse)

       •  DEBUG_LEVEL : When set to true, will enable debugging to STDERR.

       So it is very easy to specify the behaviour of DBIx::Sequence  that  you  wish  to  use  by  creating  an
       overloaded class.

       Also,  a  very important method to overload is the <b>getDbh()</b> method. This is the function that returns the
       database handle to the DBIx::Sequence. Your overloaded class should redefine the getDbh method.

       Overloading getDbh will make your sequence class integrate more cleanly with your application.

       i.e.

               package MySequence;

               use DBI;
               use DBIx::Sequence;

               use vars qw(@ISA);
               @ISA = qw(DBIx::Sequence);

               use constant STATE_TABLE =&gt; 'my_state_table';
               use constant RELEASE_TABLE =&gt; 'my_release_table';
               use constant COLUMN_PREFIX =&gt; '';
               use constant DEFAULT_INIT_VALUE =&gt; '100';
               use constant DEFAULT_ALLOW_ID_REUSE =&gt; 1;
               use constant DEBUG_LEVEL =&gt; 0;

               sub getDbh
               {
                       my $self = shift;

                       return MyApplication::MyDBModule::getDbh();
               }

               1;

       Then, your code can use this class for its sequencing. Notice that since we overloaded <b>getDbh()</b>, we don't
       need to pass a second parameter to <b>new()</b>.

               use MySequence;

               my $sequence = new MySequence();
               my $next_id = $sequence-&gt;Next($dataset);

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>NOTE</b> <b>ON</b> <b>DATABASE</b> <b>HANDLE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       DBIx::Sequence requires that the dbh object you passe to it has the AutoCommit flag set to  1.  The  main
       reason  for  this is that if AutoCommit is off, DBIx::Sequence will have to do an implicit <b>commit()</b> call,
       wich in most cases is a bad idea, especially when the dbh passed  to  the  sequence  object  already  has
       transactions prelogged in it.
