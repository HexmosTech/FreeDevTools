       Ace::Sequence::Feature - Examine Sequence Feature Tables

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # open database connection and get an Ace::Object sequence
           use Ace::Sequence;

           # get a megabase from the middle of chromosome I
           $seq = Ace::Sequence-&gt;new(-name   =&gt; 'CHROMOSOME_I,
                                     -db     =&gt; $db,
                                     -offset =&gt; 3_000_000,
                                     -length =&gt; 1_000_000);

           # get all the homologies (a list of Ace::Sequence::Feature objs)
           @homol = $seq-&gt;features('Similarity');

           # Get information about the first one
           $feature = $homol[0];
           $type    = $feature-&gt;type;
           $subtype = $feature-&gt;subtype;
           $start   = $feature-&gt;start;
           $end     = $feature-&gt;end;
           $score   = $feature-&gt;score;

           # Follow the target
           $target  = $feature-&gt;info;

           # print the target's start and end positions
           print $target-&gt;start,'-',$target-&gt;end, "\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Ace::Sequence::Feature</u> is a subclass of Ace::Sequence::Feature specialized for returning information
       about particular features in a GFF format feature table.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>CREATION</b></h4><pre>
       You will not ordinarily create an <u>Ace::Sequence::Feature</u> object directly.  Instead, objects will be
       created in response to a <b>feature()</b> call to an <u>Ace::Sequence</u> object.  If you wish to create an
       <u>Ace::Sequence::Feature</u> object directly, please consult the source code for the <u><b>new()</b></u> method.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Most methods are inherited from <u>Ace::Sequence</u>.  The following methods are also supported:

       <b>seqname()</b>
             $object = $feature-&gt;seqname;

           Return  the  ACeDB  Sequence  object  that  this  feature  is  attached  to.   The return value is an
           <u>Ace::Object</u> of the Sequence class.  This corresponds to the first field of the GFF  format  and  does
           not  necessarily  correspond  to  the  <u>Ace::Sequence</u>  object from which the feature was obtained (use
           <b>source_seq()</b> for that).

       <b>source()</b>
       <b>method()</b>
       <b>subtype()</b>
             $source = $feature-&gt;source;

           These three methods are all synonyms for the same thing.  They return the second  field  of  the  GFF
           format,  called  "source"  in  the  documentation.   This  is usually the method or algorithm used to
           predict the  feature,  such  as  "GeneFinder"  or  "tRNA"  scan.   To  avoid  ambiguity  and  enhance
           readability, the <b>method()</b> and <b>subtype()</b> synonyms are also recognized.

       <b>feature()</b>
       <b>type()</b>
             $type = $feature-&gt;type;

           These  two  methods  are  also  synonyms.   They  return  the  type  of  the feature, such as "exon",
           "similarity" or "Predicted_gene".  In the GFF documentation this is called the "feature" field.   For
           readability, you can also use <b>type()</b> to fetch the field.

       <b>abs_start()</b>
             $start = $feature-&gt;abs_start;

           This  method  returns  the  absolute  start  of  the feature within the sequence segment indicated by
           <b>seqname()</b>.  As in the <u>Ace::Sequence</u> method, use <b>start()</b> to obtain the start of the  feature  relative
           to its source.

       <b>abs_start()</b>
             $start = $feature-&gt;abs_start;

           This method returns the start of the feature relative to the sequence segment indicated by <b>seqname()</b>.
           As  in the <u>Ace::Sequence</u> method, you will more usually use the inherited <b>start()</b> method to obtain the
           start of the feature relative to its source sequence (the <u>Ace::Sequence</u> from which it was  originally
           derived).

       <b>abs_end()</b>
             $start = $feature-&gt;abs_end;

           This  method  returns the end of the feature relative to the sequence segment indicated by <b>seqname()</b>.
           As in the <u>Ace::Sequence</u> method, you will more usually use the inherited <b>end()</b> method  to  obtain  the
           end of the feature relative to the <u>Ace::Sequence</u> from which it was derived.

       <b>score()</b>
             $score = $feature-&gt;score;

           For features that are associated with a numeric score, such as similarities, this returns that value.
           For other features, this method returns undef.

       <b>strand()</b>
             $strand = $feature-&gt;strand;

           Returns  the  strandedness of this feature, either "+1" or "-1".  For features that are not stranded,
           returns 0.

       <b>reversed()</b>
             $reversed = $feature-&gt;reversed;

           Returns true if the feature is reversed relative to its source sequence.

       <b>frame()</b>
             $frame = $feature-&gt;frame;

           For features that have a frame, such as a predicted coding sequence, returns the frame, either  0,  1
           or 2.  For other features, returns undef.

       <b>group()</b>
       <b>info()</b>
       <b>target()</b>
             $info = $feature-&gt;info;

           These methods (synonyms for one another) return an Ace::Object containing other information about the
           feature  derived  from the 8th field of the GFF format, the so-called "group" field.  The type of the
           Ace::Object is dependent on the nature of the feature.  The possibilities  are  shown  in  the  table
           below:

             Feature Type           Value of Group Field
             ------------            --------------------

             note                   A Text object containing the note.

             similarity             An Ace::Sequence::Homology object containing
                                    the target and its start/stop positions.

             intron                 An Ace::Object containing the gene from
             exon                   which the feature is derived.
             misc_feature

             other                  A Text object containing the group data.

       <b>asString()</b>
             $label = $feature-&gt;asString;

           Returns a human-readable identifier describing the nature of the feature.  The format is:

            $type:$name/$start-$end

           for example:

            exon:ZK154.3/1-67

           This method is also called automatically when the object is treated in a string context.
