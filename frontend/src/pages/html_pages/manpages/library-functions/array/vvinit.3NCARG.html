</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       VVINIT - Performs initialization tasks required before VVECTR may be called to plot a vector field,
       including copying array size information into internal common block variables, establishing coordinate
       system mappings and boundaries, determining the maximum and minimum vector magnitudes and scalar array
       values, and, if required, setting up the color threshold value array.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL VVINIT (U,LU,V,LV,P,LP,M,N,WRK,LW)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_vvinit(float *u, int lu, float *v, int lv,
                     float *p, int lp, int m, int n,
                     float *wrk, int lw)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       U           (REAL 2-dimensional array, dimensioned LU x n: n &gt;= N, input): By default, assumed to contain
                   the first dimensional Cartesian components of the vector field.  However, if PLR is non-zero,
                   it is treated as containing the vector magnitudes.

       LU          (INTEGER, input): Actual value of the first dimension of array U.

       V           (REAL 2-dimensional array, dimensioned LV x n: n &gt;= N, input): By default, assumed to contain
                   the  second  dimensional  Cartesian  components of the vector field.  However, if PLR is non-
                   zero, it is treated as containing the vector angles.

       LV          (INTEGER, input): Actual value of the first dimension of array V

       P           (REAL 2-dimensional array, dimensioned LP x n: n &gt;= N, input): Array of scalar data that  may
                   be used to color the vectors. The grid points are assumed to coincide with the grid points of
                   the  U and V arrays. Required only if CTV has an absolute value of 2; otherwise this argument
                   is ignored and may be assigned a dummy value.

       LP          (INTEGER, input): Actual value of the first dimension of array P

       M           (INTEGER, input): Number of contiguous elements along the first dimensional  axis  containing
                   data to be processed in each of the arrays, U, V, and P (if used).

       N           (INTEGER,  input): Number of contiguous elements along the second dimensional axis containing
                   data to be processed in each of the arrays, U, V, and P (if used).

       WRK         (REAL, array dimensioned n: n &gt;= LW, input/output): Work array required only if the parameter
                   VMD is set to a value greater than 0.0. If required must be dimensioned greater or equal to 2
                   * M * N. Otherwise may be set to a dummy value.

       LW          (INTEGER, input): Assumed size of the array WRK. If the parameter  VMD  is  set  to  a  value
                   greater  than  0.0,  must  be  set  to a value less than or equal to the dimension of the WRK
                   array, but greater or equal to 2 * M * N. Otherwise, this argument  should  be  assigned  the
                   integer value 0.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions with the following
       exceptions:

       lu          The second dimension of u in the calling program.

       lv          The second dimension of v in the calling program.

       lp          The second dimension of p in the calling program.

       m           Number of contiguous elements along  the  second  dimensional  axis  containing  data  to  be
                   processed in each of the arrays, u, v, and p (if used).

       n           Number  of  contiguous  elements  along  the  first  dimensional  axis  containing data to be
                   processed in each of the arrays, u, v, and p (if used).

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Call VVINIT before the first invocation of VVECTR and again anytime you modify the contents of the  input
       data  arrays.  You  may  precede  a VVINIT call with any number of calls to the Vectors parameter setting
       routines (VVSETC, VVSETI, or VVSETR). After the VVINIT call, you  may  still  change  certain  parameters
       before calling VVECTR. (Consult the vectors_params man page for further information on this point.)

       Set  up  the  two vector component arrays prior to calling VVINIT.  To permit multiple purpose use of the
       array space, the VVINIT argument list includes both the actual size and an assumed  size  for  the  first
       dimension  of each input array. Due to FORTRAN array ordering conventions, only the assumed size needs to
       be specified for the second  dimension.   (Note:  when  using  the  C  bindings,  mentally  exchange  all
       references  to  first and second dimensions in this discussion.) The arguments LU, LV, and LP contain the
       actual size of the first dimensions of arrays U, V, and P respectively. Since the grid locations for each
       of the data arrays are assumed to coincide, a single argument, M, represents  the  assumed  size  of  the
       first  dimension  for  all  the  arrays.   Similarly,  the argument, N, is the assumed size of the second
       dimension. The only requirement for the actual second dimension size is that it be greater than or  equal
       to N for each array.

       The  array  specified  by  the WRK argument and its associated size specifier, LW, are used only when the
       parameter VMD (Vector Minimum Distance) is given a value greater than 0.0. In this case, Vectors uses the
       array to keep track of the location of each vector in NDC space so that the distances between vectors can
       be compared. Based on these comparisons, Vectors eliminates some vectors such that the remaining  vectors
       are  separated by at least the specified distance. If VMD is less than or equal to 0.0, you may assign an
       arbitrary dummy value to WRK, but you should set LW to the integer value 0.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       C-Binding usage is the same as FORTRAN usage discussed above if the references to "first  dimension"  and
       "second dimension" are exchanged.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use  the  ncargex command to see the following relevant examples: bnchmk, fcover, ffex00, ffex01, ffex02,
       ffex05, stex02, stex03, vvex01, vvex02.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use VVINIT or c_vvinit, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably  in
       that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
