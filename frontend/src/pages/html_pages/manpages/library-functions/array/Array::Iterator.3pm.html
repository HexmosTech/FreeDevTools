</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Array::Iterator - A simple class for iterating over Perl arrays

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.135

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       "Array::Iterator" is a Perl module that provides a simple, uni-directional iterator interface for
       traversing arrays.  It allows users to iterate over arrays, array references, or hash references
       containing an array, offering methods like next, has_next, peek, and current to facilitate controlled
       access to elements.  The iterator maintains an internal pointer, ensuring elements are accessed
       sequentially without modifying the underlying array.  Tt offers a clean, object-oriented approach to
       iteration, inspired by Java’s Iterator interface.  The module is extendable, allowing subclassing for
       custom behaviour.

         use Array::Iterator;

         # create an iterator with an array
         my $i = Array::Iterator-&gt;new(1 .. 100);

         # create an iterator with an array reference
         my $i = Array::Iterator-&gt;new(\@array);

         # create an iterator with a hash reference
         my $i = Array::Iterator-&gt;new({ __array__ =&gt; \@array });

         # a base iterator example
         while ($i-&gt;has_next()) {
             if ($i-&gt;peek() &lt; 50) {
                 # ... do something because
                 # the next element is over 50
             }
             my $current = $i-&gt;next();
             # ... do something with current
         }

         # shortcut style
         my @accumulation;
         push @accumulation =&gt; { item =&gt; $iterator-&gt;next() } while $iterator-&gt;has_next();

         # C++ ish style iterator
         for (my $i = Array::Iterator-&gt;new(@array); $i-&gt;has_next(); $i-&gt;next()) {
           my $current = $i-&gt;current();
           # .. do something with current
         }

         # common perl iterator idiom
         my $current;
         while ($current = $i-&gt;get_next()) {
           # ... do something with $current
         }

       It is not recommended to alter the array during iteration, however no attempt is made to enforce this
       (although I will if I can find an efficient means of doing so). This class only intends to provide a
       clear and simple means of generic iteration, nothing more (yet).

   <b>new</b> <b>(@array</b> <b>|</b> <b>$array_ref</b> <b>|</b> <b>$hash_ref)</b>
       The constructor can be passed either a plain Perl array, an array reference, or a hash reference (with
       the array specified as a single key of the hash, __array__).  Single-element arrays are not supported by
       either of the first two calling conventions, since it is not possible to distinguish between an array of
       a single-element which happens to be an array reference and an array reference of a single element, thus
       previous versions of the constructor would raise an exception. If you expect to pass arrays to the
       constructor which may have only a single element, then the array can be passed as the element of a HASH
       reference, with the key, __array__:

         my $i = Array::Iterator-&gt;new({ __array__ =&gt; \@array });

   <b>_current_index</b>
       An lvalue-ed subroutine that allows access to the iterator's internal pointer.  This can be used in a
       subclass to access the value.

   <b>_iteratee</b>
       This returns the item being iterated over, in our case an array.

   <b>_get_item</b> <b>($iteratee,</b> <b>$index)</b>
       This method is used by all other routines to access items. Given the iteratee and an index, it will
       return the item being stored in the $iteratee at the index of $index.

   <b>iterated</b>
       Access to the _iterated status, for subclasses

   <b>has_next([$n])</b>
       This method returns a boolean. True (1) if there are still more elements in the iterator, false (0) if
       there are not.

       Takes an optional positive integer (&gt; 0) that specifies the position you want to check. This allows you
       to check if there an element at an arbitrary position.  Think of it as an ordinal number you want to
       check:

         $i-&gt;<a href="../man2/has_next.2.html">has_next</a>(2);  # 2nd next element
         $i-&gt;<a href="../man10/has_next.10.html">has_next</a>(10); # 10th next element

       Note that <a href="../man1/has_next.1.html">has_next</a>(1) is the same as has_next().

       Throws an exception if $n &lt;= 0.

   <b>hasNext</b>
       Alternative name for has_next

   <b>next</b>
       This method returns the next item in the iterator, be sure to only call this once per iteration as it
       will advance the index pointer to the next item. If this method is called after all elements have been
       exhausted, an exception will be thrown.

   <b>get_next</b>
       This method returns the next item in the iterator, be sure to only call this once per iteration as it
       will advance the index pointer to the next item. If this method is called after all elements have been
       exhausted, it will return undef.

       This method was added to allow for a fairly common Perl iterator idiom of:

         my $current;
         while ($current = $i-&gt;get_next()) {
             ...
         }

       In this, the loop terminates once $current is assigned to a false value.  The only problem with this
       idiom for me is that it does not allow for undefined or false values in the iterator. Of course, if this
       fits your data, then there is no problem. Otherwise I would recommend the "has_next"/"next" idiom
       instead.

   <b>getNext</b>
       Alternative name for get_next

   <b>peek([$n])</b>
       This method can be used to peek ahead at the next item in the iterator. It is non-destructive, meaning it
       does not advance the internal pointer. If this method is called and attempts to reach beyond the bounds
       of the iterator, it will return undef.

       Takes an optional positive integer (&gt; 0) that specifies how far ahead you want to peek:

         $i-&gt;<a href="../man2/peek.2.html">peek</a>(2);  # gives you 2nd next element
         $i-&gt;<a href="../man10/peek.10.html">peek</a>(10); # gives you 10th next element

       Note that <a href="../man1/peek.1.html">peek</a>(1) is the same as peek().

       Throws an exception if $n &lt;= 0.

       <b>NOTE:</b> Before version 0.03 this method would throw an exception if called out of bounds. I decided this
       was not a good practice, as it made it difficult to be able to peek ahead effectively. This is not the
       case when calling with an argument that is &lt;= 0 though, as it's clearly a sign of incorrect usage.

   <b>current</b>
       This method can be used to get the current item in the iterator. It is non-destructive, meaning that it
       does not advance the internal pointer. This value will match the last value dispensed by "next" or
       "get_next".

   <b>current_index</b>
       This method can be used to get the current index in the iterator. It is non-destructive, meaning that it
       does not advance the internal pointer. This value will match the index of the last value dispensed by
       "next" or "get_next".

   <b>currentIndex</b>
       Alternative name for current_index

   <b>reset</b>
       Reset index to allow iteration from the start

   <b>get_length</b>
       This is a basic accessor for getting the length of the array being iterated over.

   <b>getLength</b>
       Alternative name for get_length

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       Improve BiDirectional Test suite
           I want to test the back-and-forth a little more and make sure they work well with one another.

       Other Iterators
           Array::Iterator::BiDirectional::Circular,                Array::Iterator::Skipable                and
           Array::Iterator::BiDirectional::Skipable are just a few ideas I have had. I am going to hold off  for
           now until I am sure they are actually useful.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       This  module  now  includes  several  subclasses  of  Array::Iterator  which  add  certain  behaviors  to
       Array::Iterator, they are:

       "Array::Iterator::BiDirectional"
           Adds the ability to move backward and forward through the array.

       "Array::Iterator::Circular"
           When this iterator reaches the end of its list, it will loop back to the start again.

       "Array::Iterator::Reusable"
           This iterator can be reset to its beginning and used again.

       The Design Patterns book by the Gang of Four, specifically the Iterator pattern.

       Some of the interface for this class is based on the Java Iterator interface.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>ITERATOR</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       There are several on CPAN with the word Iterator in them.  Most of them are actually  iterators  included
       inside  other  modules,  and  only really useful within that parent module's context. There are, however,
       some other modules out there that are just for pure iteration. I have provided a list below of the ones I
       have found if perhaps you don't happen to like the way I do it.

       Tie::Array::Iterable
           This module ties the array, something we do not do. But it also makes an attempt to account for,  and
           allow  the  array to be changed during iteration. It accomplishes this control because the underlying
           array is tied. As we all know, tie-ing things can be a performance issue, but if you need  what  this
           module provides, then it will likely be an acceptable compromise. Array::Iterator makes no attempt to
           deal  with  this  mid-iteration  manipulation  problem.  In fact, it is recommended to not alter your
           array with Array::Iterator, and if possible we will enforce this in later versions.

       Data::Iter
           This module allows for simple iteration over both hashes and arrays.  It does it by importing several
           functions that can be used to loop over either type (hash or  array)  in  the  same  way.  It  is  an
           interesting  module,  it  differs  from  Array::Iterator in paradigm (Array::Iterator is more OO) and
           intent.

       Class::Iterator
           This is essentially a wrapper around a closure-based iterator.  This method can be very flexible, but
           at times is difficult to manage due to the inherent complexity of using closures. I  actually  was  a
           closure-as-iterator  fan  for  a  while  but eventually moved away from it in favor of the more plain
           vanilla means of iteration, like that found Array::Iterator.

       Class::Iter
           This is part of the Class::Visitor module and is a Visitor and Iterator extension to Class::Template.
           Array::Iterator is a standalone module that is not associated with others.

       <b>Data::Iterator::EasyObj</b>
           Data::Iterator::EasyObj makes your array of arrays into iterator objects.  It also can  further  nest
           additional  data  structures  including  Data::Iterator::EasyObj  objects.   Array::Iterator  is one-
           dimensional only and does not attempt to do many of the more advanced features of this module.
