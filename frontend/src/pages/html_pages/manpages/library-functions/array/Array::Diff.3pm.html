       Array::Diff - Find the differences between two arrays

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my @old = ( 'a', 'b', 'c' );
           my @new = ( 'b', 'c', 'd' );

           my $diff = Array::Diff-&gt;diff( \@old, \@new );

           $diff-&gt;count   # 2
           $diff-&gt;added   # [ 'd' ];
           $diff-&gt;deleted # [ 'a' ];

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module compares two <b>pre-sorted</b> arrays and returns the added or deleted elements in two separate
       arrays.  It's a simple wrapper around Algorithm::Diff.

       <b>Note</b>: the arrays must be sorted before you call "diff".

       And if you need more complex array tools, check Array::Compare.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new ()
           Create a new "Array::Diff" object.

       diff ( OLD, NEW )
           Compute  the  differences  between two arrays.  The results are stored in the "added", "deleted", and
           "count" properties that may be examined using the corresponding methods.

           This method may be invoked as an object method, in which case it will recalculate the differences and
           repopulate the "count", "added", and "removed" properties, or as a static method, in  which  case  it
           will return a newly-created "Array::Diff" object with the properties set appropriately.

       added ( [VALUES ] )
           Get  or  set  the  elements  present in the "NEW" array and absent in the "OLD" one at the comparison
           performed by the last "diff()" invocation.

       deleted ( [VALUES] )
           Get or set the elements present in the "OLD" array and absent in the  "NEW"  one  at  the  comparison
           performed by the last "diff()" invocation.

       count ( [VALUE] )
           Get  or  set  the  total  number of added or deleted elements at the comparison performed by the last
           "diff()" invocation.  This count should be equal to the sum of the number of elements in the  "added"
           and "deleted" properties.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Array::Compare - performs the same function as this module, but has options for controlling how it works.

       List::Compare - similar functionality, but again with more options.

       Algorithm::Diff - the underlying implementation of the diff algorithm.  If you've got Algorithm::Diff::XS
       installed, that will be used.

       YAML::Diff - find difference between two YAML documents.

       HTML::Differences  -  find  difference  between  two HTML documents.  This uses a more sane approach than
       HTML::Diff.

       XML::Diff - find difference between two XML documents.

       Hash::Diff - find the differences between two Perl hashes.

       Data::Diff - find difference between two arbitrary data structures.

       Text::Diff - can find difference between two inputs, which can be data structures or file names.
