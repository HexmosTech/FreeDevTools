       Array::Group - Convert an array into array of arrayrefs of uniform size N.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Array::Group qw( :all );

         @sample = ( 1 .. 10 );
         $rowsize = 3;

         ngroup $rowsize =&gt; \@sample ;
         # yields
                (
                   [   1,   2,   3   ],
                   [   4,   5,   6   ],
                   [   7,   8,   9   ],
                   [   10   ]
                 );

         dissect $rowsize =&gt; \@sample ;
         # yields
                (
                   [   1,   5,   9   ],
                   [   2,   6,  10   ],
                   [   3,   7   ],
                   [   4,   8   ]
                 );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "ngroup" method reformats a list into a list of arrayrefs. It is often used for formatting data into
       HTML tables, amongst other things.

       "dissect()" returns a list of lists where the first element of each sublist will be one of the first
       elements of the source list, and the last element will be one of the last.  This behaviour is much more
       useful when the input list is sorted.

       The key difference between the two methods is that "dissect()" takes elements from the start of the list
       provided and pushes them onto each of the subarrays sequentially, rather than simply dividing the list
       into discrete chunks.

       Both methods can be called as either functions or class methods (to ensure compatibility with previous
       releases), and the array to be reformed can be passed as a reference.

   <b>CONTRIBUTORS</b>
       I  would  like to thank Alexandr Ciornii for his help in upgrading this distribution's format. He took me
       from using a <u>test.pl</u> file to using the <u>t/</u> directory and removed some old  crufty  things  that  were  not
       needed.  He also upgraded the Makefile.PL.
