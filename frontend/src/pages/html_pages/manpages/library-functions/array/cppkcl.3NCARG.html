</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPPKCL - Picks a set of contour levels.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL CPPKCL (ZDAT, RWRK, IWRK)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_cppkcl (float *zdat, float *rwrk, int *iwrk)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       All three arguments are arrays used in the last call to CPRECT, CPSPS1, or CPSPS2, the contents of which
       must not have been changed since that call.

       ZDAT        (REAL  array,  dimensioned as specified in the last call to CPRECT, CPSPS1, or CPSPS2, input)
                   is the data array.

       RWRK        (REAL array, dimensioned as specified  in  the  last  call  to  CPRECT,  CPSPS1,  or  CPSPS2,
                   input/output) is the real workspace array.

       IWRK        (INTEGER  array,  dimensioned  as  specified  in  the last call to CPRECT, CPSPS1, or CPSPS2,
                   input/output) is the integer workspace array.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Normally, CPPKCL is called by CONPACK when the contour levels are needed; it may be  called  directly  by
       the  user  when  it  is  desired  to  modify the resulting parameter arrays specifying contour levels and
       associated quantities in some way.  CPPKCL must be called after initialization has been done (by  a  call
       to  one  of  the  initialization  routines  CPRECT, CPSPS1, or CPSPS2); this is because CPPKCL depends on
       values set during initialization.

       If the contour-level-selection parameter 'CLS' is zero (indicating that the user intends to pick  contour
       levels),  or  if  the  constant-field-flag 'CFF' is non-zero (indicating that, during initialization, the
       data were found to be essentially constant), CPPKCL does nothing.   Otherwise,  CPPKCL  picks  a  set  of
       contour  levels.   The  way  in  which  it  picks these levels is determined by the value of the internal
       parameter 'CLS'; see the description of this parameter in the conpack_params man page.

       When CPPKCL picks contour levels, it sets the value of the internal parameter 'NCL' equal to  the  number
       of  contour  levels  picked.   It then sets the values of elements 1 through 'NCL' of the parameter array
       'CLV' (contour level values) to the levels chosen.  The Ith elements of the associated  parameter  arrays
       are set as follows:

       CLU = 1 or 3               Contour level use flag
       AIA = I+1                  Area identifier above the level
       AIB = I                    Area identifier below the level
       LLT = ' ' (single blank)   Contour line label text
       CLD = '$$$$$$$$$$$$$'      Contour line dash pattern
       CLC = -1                   Contour line color
       LLC = -1                   Contour line label color
       CLL = 0.                   Contour line line width

       Thus, after CPPKCL is called, the situation for each contour level is as follows:

       •      Contour lines at the level are to be drawn by calls to CPCLDM or CPCLDR.

       •      The lines will be labeled if 'CLU'=3, but not if 'CLU'=1.

       •      If  CPCLAM  is  called, lines at the level will be added to the area map; the area identifiers for
              areas "above" the level and for areas "below" the level are as specified by 'AIA' and 'AIB'.

       •      The dash pattern for the level is solid, and neither the color of  the  line,  the  color  of  the
              labels on it, nor its width are to be set.

       •      The text of the label associated with the level is, as yet, unspecified.

       By resetting elements in these parameter arrays, the user can change the situation in various ways.
