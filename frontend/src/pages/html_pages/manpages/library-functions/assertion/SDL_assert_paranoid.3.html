</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_assert_paranoid - An assertion test that is performed only when built with paranoid settings.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;SDL3/SDL_assert.h&gt;</b>

       <b>#define</b> <b>SDL_assert_paranoid(condition)</b> <b>SDL_disabled_assert(condition)</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This macro is enabled when the <b>SDL_ASSERT_LEVEL</b> is &gt;= 3, otherwise it is disabled. This is a higher level
       than  both  release  and  debug,  so these tests are meant to be expensive and only run when specifically
       looking for extremely unexpected failure cases in a special build.

       When assertions are disabled, this wraps <b>condition</b> in a <b>sizeof</b> operator, which means any  function  calls
       and  side  effects  will not run, but the compiler will not complain about any otherwise-unused variables
       that are only referenced in the assertion.

       One can set the environment variable "<b>SDL_ASSERT</b>" to one of several strings ("abort",  "break",  "retry",
       "ignore",  "always_ignore")  to force a default behavior, which may be desirable for automation purposes.
       If your platform requires GUI interfaces to happen on the main thread but you're debugging  an  assertion
       in  a background thread, it might be desirable to set this to "break" so that your debugger takes control
       as soon as assert is triggered,  instead  of  risking  a  bad  UI  interaction  (deadlock,  etc)  in  the
       application.

</pre><h4><b>MACRO</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>condition</u>
              boolean value to test.

</pre><h4><b>THREAD</b> <b>SAFETY</b></h4><pre>
       It is safe to call this macro from any thread.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This macro is available since SDL 3.2.0.
