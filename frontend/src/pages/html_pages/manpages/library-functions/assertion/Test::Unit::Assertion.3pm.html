       Test::Unit::Assertion - The abstract base class for assertions

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Any assertion class that expects to plug into Test::Unit::Assert needs to implement this interface.

   <b>Required</b> <b>methods</b>
       new Creates  a  new  assertion object. Takes whatever arguments you desire.  Isn't strictly necessary for
           the framework to work with this class but is generally considered a good idea.

       do_assertion
           This is the important one. If Test::Unit::Assert::assert is  called  with  an  object  as  its  first
           argument then it does:

               $_[0]-&gt;do_assertion(@_[1 .. $#_]) ||
                   $self-&gt;fail("Assertion failed");

           This  means that "do_assertion" should return true if the assertion succeeds and false if it doesn't.
           Or, you can fail by throwing a Test::Unit::Failure object, which will get caught further up the stack
           and used to produce a sensible error report. Generally it's good practice  for  do_assertion  to  die
           with a meaningful error on assertion failure rather than just returning false.
