       Test::Unit::Assertion::Boolean - A boolean assertion

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. This is simply a boolean assertion that exists solely to
       rationalize the way Test::Unit::Assert::assert does its thing. You should never have to instantiate one
       of these directly. Ever. Go away. There's nothing to see here.

       Look, I've told you, there's nothing going on here. If you go looking at the listing of this module
       you'll see that it does almost nothing.  Why on earth you're still reading at this point is something of
       a mystery to me. After all, if you're hacking on the Test::Unit source code you'll be able to use the
       Source.
