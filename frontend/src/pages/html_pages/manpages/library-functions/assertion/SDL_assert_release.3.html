</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_assert_release - An assertion test that is performed even in release builds.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;SDL3/SDL_assert.h&gt;</b>

       <b>#define</b> <b>SDL_assert_release(condition)</b> <b>SDL_disabled_assert(condition)</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  macro  is  enabled when the <b>SDL_ASSERT_LEVEL</b> is &gt;= 1, otherwise it is disabled. This is meant to be
       for tests that are cheap to make and extremely unlikely to fail; generally it is frowned upon to have  an
       assertion  failure  in  a  release build, so these assertions generally need to be of more than life-and-
       death importance if there's a chance they might trigger. You should almost always consider handling these
       cases more gracefully than an assert allows.

       When assertions are disabled, this wraps <b>condition</b> in a <b>sizeof</b> operator, which means any  function  calls
       and  side  effects  will not run, but the compiler will not complain about any otherwise-unused variables
       that are only referenced in the assertion.

       One can set the environment variable "<b>SDL_ASSERT</b>" to one of several strings ("abort",  "break",  "retry",
       "ignore",  "always_ignore")  to force a default behavior, which may be desirable for automation purposes.
       If your platform requires GUI interfaces to happen on the main thread but you're debugging  an  assertion
       in  a background thread, it might be desirable to set this to "break" so that your debugger takes control
       as soon as assert is triggered,  instead  of  risking  a  bad  UI  interaction  (deadlock,  etc)  in  the
       application. *
