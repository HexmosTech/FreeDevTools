</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package provides a class for the creation of objects able to process and convert text written in the
       <u>doctoc</u> markup language into any output format X for which a <u>formatting</u> <u>engine</u> is available.

       A  reader interested in the markup language itself should start with the <u>doctoc</u> <u>language</u> <u>introduction</u> and
       proceed from there to the formal specifications, i.e. the <u>doctoc</u> <u>language</u> <u>syntax</u> and the <u>doctoc</u>  <u>language</u>
       <u>command</u> <u>reference</u>.

       If  on  the  other  hand  the reader wishes to write her own formatting engine for some format, i.e. is a
       <u>plugin</u> <u>writer</u> then reading and understanding the <u>doctoc</u> <u>plugin</u> <u>API</u> <u>reference</u> is an absolute necessity, as
       that document specifies the interaction between  this  package  and  its  plugins,  i.e.  the  formatting
       engines, in detail.

</pre><h4><b>PUBLIC</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
   <b>PACKAGE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       <b>::doctools::toc::new</b> <u>objectName</u> ?<b>-option</b> <u>value</u> ...?
              This  command creates a new doctoc object with an associated Tcl command whose name is <u>objectName</u>.
              This <u>object</u> command is explained in full detail in the sections <b>OBJECT</b> <b>COMMAND</b> and <b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b>.
              The object command will be created under the current namespace if  the  <u>objectName</u>  is  not  fully
              qualified, and in the specified namespace otherwise.

              The  options  and  their  values  coming  after the name of the object are used to set the initial
              configuration of the object.

       <b>::doctools::toc::help</b>
              This is a convenience command for  applications  wishing  to  provide  their  user  with  a  short
              description  of  the  available  formatting  commands  and  their  meanings.  It  returns a string
              containing a standard help text.

       <b>::doctools::toc::search</b> <u>path</u>
              Whenever an object created by this the package has to map  the  name  of  a  format  to  the  file
              containing  the  code  for  its  formatting  engine  it  will  search  for the file in a number of
              directories stored in a list. See section <b>FORMAT</b> <b>MAPPING</b> for more explanations.

              This list not only contains three default directories which are declared by  the  package  itself,
              but is also extensible user of the package.  This command is the means to do so. When given a <u>path</u>
              to an existing and readable directory it will prepend that directory to the list of directories to
              search. This means that the <u>path</u> added last is later searched through first.

              An error will be thrown if the <u>path</u> either does not exist, is not a directory, or is not readable.

   <b>OBJECT</b> <b>COMMAND</b>
       All  commands  created  by <b>::doctools::toc::new</b> have the following general form and may be used to invoke
       various operations on their doctoc converter object.

       <b>objectName</b> <b>method</b> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
              The method <b>method</b> and its <u>arg</u>'uments determine the exact behavior  of  the  command.  See  section
              <b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b> for the detailed specifications.

   <b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       <u>objectName</u> <b>configure</b>
              The  method  returns  a list of all known options and their current values when called without any
              arguments.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>configure</b> <u>option</u>
              The method behaves like the method <b>cget</b> when called with a single argument and returns  the  value
              of the option specified by said argument.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>configure</b> <b>-option</b> <u>value</u>...
              The  method  reconfigures  the  specified  <b>option</b>s  of  the object, setting them to the associated
              <u>value</u>s, when called with an even number of arguments, at least two.

              The legal options are described in the section <b>OBJECT</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>cget</b> <b>-option</b>
              This method expects a legal configuration option as argument and will return the current value  of
              that option for the object the method was invoked for.

              The legal configuration options are described in section <b>OBJECT</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>destroy</b>
              This method destroys the object it is invoked for.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>format</b> <u>text</u>
              This  method  runs  the  <u>text</u>  through  the configured formatting engine and returns the generated
              string as its result. An error will be thrown if no <b>-format</b> was configured for the object.

              The method assumes that the <u>text</u> is in <u>doctoc</u>  format  as  specified  in  the  companion  document
              <u>doctoc_fmt</u>. Errors will be thrown otherwise.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>map</b> <u>symbolic</u> <u>actual</u>
              This  methods  add one entry to the per-object mapping from <u>symbolic</u> filenames to the <u>actual</u> uris.
              The object just stores this mapping and makes it available to  the  configured  formatting  engine
              through  the  command  <b>dt_fmap</b>.  This command is described in more detail in the <u>doctoc</u> <u>plugin</u> <u>API</u>
              <u>reference</u> which specifies the interaction between the objects created  by  this  package  and  toc
              formatting engines.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>parameters</b>
              This  method  returns  a  list  containing  the  names  of  all  engine parameters provided by the
              configured formatting engine. It will return an empty list if the object is not yet configured for
              a specific format.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>search</b> <u>path</u>
              This method extends the per-object list of paths searched for toc formatting engines. See also the
              command <b>::doctools::toc::search</b> on how to extend the per-package list of paths. Note that the path
              entered last will be searched first.  For more details see section <b>FORMAT</b> <b>MAPPING</b>.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>setparam</b> <u>name</u> <u>value</u>
              This method sets the <u>name</u>d engine parameter to the specified <u>value</u>.  It will throw an error if the
              object is either not yet configured for a specific format, or if the  formatting  engine  for  the
              configured  format  does  not  provide  a  parameter  with the given <u>name</u>.  The list of parameters
              provided by the configured formatting engine can be retrieved through the method <b>parameters</b>.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>warnings</b>
              This method returns a list containing all the warnings which  were  generated  by  the  configured
              formatting engine during the last invocation of the method <b>format</b>.

   <b>OBJECT</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       All doctoc objects understand the following configuration options:

       <b>-file</b> <u>file</u>
              The  argument  of  this  option  is  stored  in  the  object  and made available to the configured
              formatting engine through the command <b>dt_file</b>.  This command is described in more  detail  in  the
              companion document <u>doctoc_api</u> which specifies the API between the object and formatting engines.

              The default value of this option is the empty string.

              The configured formatting engine should interpret the value as the name of the file containing the
              document which is currently processed.

       <b>-format</b> <u>text</u>
              The  argument  of  this  option specifies the format to generate and by implication the formatting
              engine to use when converting text via the method <b>format</b>. Its default value is the  empty  string.
              The method <b>format</b> cannot be used if this option is not set to a valid value at least once.

              The  package  will  immediately  try  to  map  the  given name to a file containing the code for a
              formatting engine generating that format. An error will be thrown if this mapping fails.  In  that
              case a previously configured format is left untouched.

              The  section  <b>FORMAT</b>  <b>MAPPING</b>  explains  in detail how the package and object will look for engine
              implementations.

   <b>FORMAT</b> <b>MAPPING</b>
       The package and object will perform the following algorithm when trying to map a format  name  <u>foo</u>  to  a
       file containing an implementation of a formatting engine for <u>foo</u>:

       [1]    If <u>foo</u> is the name of an existing file then this file is directly taken as the implementation.

       [2]    If  not,  the  list  of  per-object  search  paths is searched. For each directory in the list the
              package checks if that directory contains a file "<u>toc.foo</u>". If yes, then that file is taken as the
              implementation.

              Note that this list of paths is initially empty and can be  extended  through  the  object  method
              <b>search</b>.

       [3]    If  not, the list of package paths is searched.  For each directory in the list the package checks
              if  that  directory  contains  a  file  "<u>toc.foo</u>".  If  yes,  then  that  file  is  taken  as  the
              implementation.

              This  list  of  paths  can  be  extended through the command <b>::doctools::toc::search</b>.  It contains
              initially one path, the subdirectory "<u>mpformats</u>" of the directory the package  itself  is  located
              in.  In  other  words,  if  the  package implementation "<u>doctoc.tcl</u>" is installed in the directory
              "<u>/usr/local/lib/tcllib/doctools</u>"   then   it   will    by    default    search    the    directory
              "<u>/usr/local/lib/tcllib/doctools/mpformats</u>" for format implementations.

       [4]    The mapping fails.

</pre><h4><b>PREDEFINED</b> <b>ENGINES</b></h4><pre>
       The  package  provides  predefined  formatting  engines for the following formats. Some of the formatting
       engines support engine parameters. These will be explicitly highlighted.

       html   This engine generates HTML markup, for processing by  web  browsers  and  the  like.  This  engine
              supports three parameters:

              footer The value for this parameter has to be valid selfcontained HTML markup for the body section
                     of  a  HTML document. The default value is the empty string. The value is inserted into the
                     generated output just before the <b>&lt;/body&gt;</b> tag, closing the body of the generated HTML.

                     This can be used to insert boilerplate footer markup into the generated document.

              header The value for this parameter has to be valid selfcontained HTML markup for the body section
                     of a HTML document. The default value is the empty string. The value is inserted  into  the
                     generated output just after the <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> tag, starting the body of the generated HTML.

                     This can be used to insert boilerplate header markup into the generated document.

              meta   The  value  for  this  parameter  has  to be valid selfcontained HTML markup for the header
                     section of a HTML document. The default value is the empty string. The  value  is  inserted
                     into  the  generated  output  just after the <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> tag, starting the header section of the
                     generated HTML.

                     This can be used to insert boilerplate meta data markup into the generated  document,  like
                     references to a stylesheet, standard meta keywords, etc.

       latex  This engine generates output suitable for the <b>latex</b> text processor coming out of the TeX world.

       list   This  engine retrieves version, section and title of the manpage from the document. As such it can
              be used to generate a directory listing for a set of manpages.

       markdown
              This engine generates <u>Markdown</u> markup.

       nroff  This engine generates nroff output, for processing by <b>nroff</b>, or <b>groff</b>. The result will be standard
              man pages as they are known in the unix world.

       null   This engine generates no outout at all. This can be used if one just wants to validate some input.

       tmml   This engine generates TMML markup as specified by Joe English. The Tcl Manpage Markup Language  is
              a derivate of XML.

       wiki   This engine generates Wiki markup as understood by Jean Claude Wippler's <b>wikit</b> application.
