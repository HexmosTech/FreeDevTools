</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This little package serves to access the symbol table of perl.

       "Devel::Symdump-&gt;rnew(@packages)"
           returns  a  symbol  table  object  for  all  subtrees  below  @packages.  Nested Modules are analyzed
           recursively. If no package is given as argument, it defaults to "main". That means to get  the  whole
           symbol table, just do a "rnew" without arguments.

           The  global  variable  $Devel::Symdump::MAX_RECURSION limits the recursion to prevent contention. The
           default value is set to 97, just low enough to survive the test suite without a  warning  about  deep
           recursion.

       "Devel::Symdump-&gt;new(@packages)"
           does not go into recursion and only analyzes the packages that are given as arguments.

       packages, scalars, arrays, hashes, functions, ios
           The  methods  <b>packages()</b>,  <b>scalars()</b>,  <b>arrays()</b>,  <b>hashes()</b>, <b>functions()</b>, <b>ios()</b>, and (for older perls)
           <b>unknowns()</b> each return an array of fully qualified symbols of the specified type in all packages that
           are held within a Devel::Symdump object, but without the  leading  "$",  "@"  or  "%".  In  a  scalar
           context,  they  will return the number of such symbols. Unknown symbols are usually either formats or
           variables that haven't yet got a defined value.

           Note that scalar symbol table entries are a special case.  If a symbol table  entry  exists  at  all,
           presence  of  a  scalar  is  currently  unknowable,  due  to  a  feature of Perl described in "Making
           References" in perlref point 7.  For example, this package will mark a scalar value $foo  as  present
           if any of @foo, %foo, &amp;foo etc. have been declared or used.

       as_string
       as_HTML
           <b>As_string()</b> and <b>as_HTML()</b> return a simple string/HTML representations of the object.

       diff
           <b>Diff()</b> prints the difference between two Devel::Symdump objects in human readable form. The format is
           similar to the one used by the as_string method.

       isa_tree
       inh_tree
           <b>Isa_tree()</b> and <b>inh_tree()</b> both return a simple string representation of the current inheritance tree.
           The  difference  between  the two methods is the direction from which the tree is viewed: top-down or
           bottom-up. As I'm sure, many users will have different expectation about what  is  top  and  what  is
           bottom, I'll provide an example what happens when the Socket module is loaded:

       % print Devel::Symdump-&gt;inh_tree
               AutoLoader
                       DynaLoader
                               Socket
               DynaLoader
                       Socket
               Exporter
                       Carp
                       Config
                       Socket

           The inh_tree method shows on the left hand side a package name and indented to the right the packages
           that use the former.

       % print Devel::Symdump-&gt;isa_tree
               Carp
                       Exporter
               Config
                       Exporter
               DynaLoader
                       AutoLoader
               Socket
                       Exporter
                       DynaLoader
                               AutoLoader

           The  isa_tree  method  displays  from  left to right ISA relationships, so Socket IS A DynaLoader and
           DynaLoader IS A AutoLoader. (Actually, they were at the time this manpage was written)

       You may call both methods, <b>isa_tree()</b> and <b>inh_tree()</b>, with an object. If you do  that,  the  object  will
       store the output and retrieve it when you call the same method again later. The typical usage would be to
       use them as class methods directly though.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCLASSING</b></h4><pre>
       The  design  of this package is intentionally primitive and allows it to be subclassed easily. An example
       of a (maybe) useful subclass is Devel::Symdump::Export, a  package  which  exports  all  methods  of  the
       Devel::Symdump package and turns them into functions.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Routines for manipulating stashes: "Package::Stash"; to work with lexicals: "PadWalker".
