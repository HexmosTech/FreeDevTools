</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Devel::Leak - Utility for looking for perl objects that are not reclaimed.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Devel::Leak;
         ... setup code

         my $count = Devel::Leak::NoteSV($handle);

         ... code that may leak

         Devel::Leak::CheckSV($handle);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Devel::Leak has two functions "NoteSV" and "CheckSV".

       "NoteSV" walks the perl internal table of allocated SVs (scalar values) - (which actually  contains
       arrays and hashes too), and records their addresses in a table. It returns a count of these "things", and
       stores a pointer to the table (which is obtained from the heap using <b>malloc()</b>) in its argument.

       "CheckSV" is passed argument which holds a pointer to a table created by "NoteSV". It re-walks the perl-
       internals and calls <b>sv_dump()</b> for any "things" which did not exist when "NoteSV" was called. It returns a
       count of the number of "things" now allocated.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that you need a perl built with -DDEBUGGING for <b>sv_dump()</b> to print anything, but counts are valid in
       any perl.

       If new "things" <u>have</u> been created, "CheckSV" may (also) report additional "things" which are allocated by
       the <b>sv_dump()</b> code.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       This little utility module was part of Tk until the variable renaming in perl5.005 made it clear that Tk
       had no business knowing this much about the perl internals.
