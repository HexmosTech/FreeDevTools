</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "Devel::MAT::Dumper" - write a heap dump file for later analysis

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use Devel::MAT::Dumper;

          Devel::MAT::Dumper::dump( "path/to/the/file.pmat" );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides the memory-dumping function that creates a heap dump file which can later be read by
       Devel::MAT::Dumpfile. It provides a single function which is not exported, which writes a file to the
       given path.

       The dump file will contain a representation of every SV in Perl's arena, providing information about
       pointers between them, as well as other information about the state of the process at the time it was
       created. It contains a snapshot of the process at that moment in time, which can later be loaded and
       analysed by various tools using "Devel::MAT::Dumpfile".

       This module used to be part of the main Devel::MAT distribution but is now in its own one so that it can
       be installed independently on servers or other locations where perl processes need to inspected but
       analysis tools can be run elsewhere.

</pre><h4><b>IMPORT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following "import" options control the behaviour of the module. They may primarily be useful when
       used in the "-M" perl option:

   <b>-dump_at_DIE</b>
       Installs a handler for the special "__DIE__" signal to write a dump file when die() is about to cause a
       fatal signal. This is more reliable at catching the callstack and memory state than using an "END" block.

          $ perl -MDevel::MAT::Dumper=-dump_at_DIE ...

   <b>-dump_at_WARN</b>
       Installs a handler for the special "__WARN__" signal to write a dump file when perl prints a warning.

          $ perl -MDevel::MAT::Dumper=-dump_at_WARN ...

       It is likely useful to combine this with the "NNN" numbering feature of the "-file" argument, to ensure
       that later warnings don't overwrite a particular file.

   <b>-dump_at_END</b>
       Installs an "END" block which writes a dump file at "END" time, just before the interpreter exits.

          $ perl -MDevel::MAT::Dumper=-dump_at_END ...

   <b>-dump_at_SIGQUIT</b>
       Installs a handler for "SIGQUIT" to write a dump file if the signal is received. The signal handler will
       remain in place and can be used several times.

          $ perl -MDevel::MAT::Dumper=-dump_at_SIGQUIT ...

       Take care if you are using the "&lt;Ctrl-\&gt;" key combination on a terminal to send this signal to a
       foreground process, because if it has fork()ed any background workers or similar, the signal will also be
       delivered to those as well.

   <b>-dump_at_SIG</b><u><b>NAME</b></u>
       Installs a handler for the named signal (e.g. "SIGABRT", "SIGINT") to write a dump file if the signal is
       received. After dumping the file, the signal handler is removed and the signal re-raised.

          $ perl -MDevel::MAT::Dumper=-dump_at_SIGABRT ...

       Note that "SIGABRT" uses an "unsafe" signal handler (i.e. not deferred until the next perl op), so it can
       capture the full context of any ongoing XS or C library operations.

   <b>-file</b> <b>$PATH</b>
       Sets the name of the file which is automatically dumped; defaults to basename <u>$0.pmat</u> if not supplied.

          $ perl -MDevel::MAT::Dumper=-file,foo.pmat ...

       In the special case that $0 is exactly the string "-e" or "-E", the filename will be prefixed with "perl"
       so as not to create files whose names begin with a leading hyphen, as this confuses some commandline
       parsers.

          $ perl -MDevel::MAT::Dumper=-dump_at_END -E 'say "hello"'
          hello
          Dumping to perl-e.pmat because of END

       If the pattern contains "NNN", this will be replaced by a unique serial number per written file, starting
       from 0. This may be helpful in the case of "DIE", "WARN" or "SIGQUIT" handlers, which could be invoked
       multiple times.

       The file name is converted to an absolute path immediately, so if the running program later calls
       chdir(), it will still be generated in the directory the program started from rather than the one it
       happens to be in at the time.

   <b>-max_string</b>
       Sets the maximum length of string buffer to dump from PVs; defaults to 256 if not supplied. Use a
       negative size to dump the entire buffer of every PV regardless of size.

   <b>-eager_open</b>
       Opens the dump file immediately at "import" time, instead of waiting until the time it actually writes
       the heap dump. This may be useful if the process changes user ID, or to debug problems involving too many
       open filehandles.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These functions are not exported, they must be called fully-qualified.

   <b>dump</b>
          dump( $path );

       Writes a heap dump to the named file

   <b>dumpfh</b>
          dumpfh( $fh );

       Writes a heap dump to the given filehandle (which must be a plain OS-level filehandle, though does not
       need to be a regular file, or seekable).
