</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Devel::StackTrace - An object representing a stack trace

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.05

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Devel::StackTrace;

         my $trace = Devel::StackTrace-&gt;new;

         print $trace-&gt;as_string; # like carp

         # from top (most recent) of stack to bottom.
         while ( my $frame = $trace-&gt;next_frame ) {
             print "Has args\n" if $frame-&gt;hasargs;
         }

         # from bottom (least recent) of stack to top.
         while ( my $frame = $trace-&gt;prev_frame ) {
             print "Sub: ", $frame-&gt;subroutine, "\n";
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "Devel::StackTrace" module contains two classes, "Devel::StackTrace" and Devel::StackTrace::Frame.
       These objects encapsulate the information that can retrieved via Perl's "caller" function, as well as
       providing a simple interface to this data.

       The "Devel::StackTrace" object contains a set of "Devel::StackTrace::Frame" objects, one for each level
       of the stack. The frames contain all the data available from "caller".

       This code was created to support my Exception::Class::Base class (part of Exception::Class) but may be
       useful in other contexts.

</pre><h4><b>'TOP'</b> <b>AND</b> <b>'BOTTOM'</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>STACK</b></h4><pre>
       When describing the methods of the trace object, I use the words 'top' and 'bottom'. In this context, the
       'top' frame on the stack is the most recent frame and the 'bottom' is the least recent.

       Here's an example:

         foo();  # bottom frame is here

         sub foo {
            bar();
         }

         sub bar {
            Devel::StackTrace-&gt;new;  # top frame is here.
         }

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This class provide the following methods:

   <b>Devel::StackTrace-&gt;new(%named_params)</b>
       Returns a new Devel::StackTrace object.

       Takes the following parameters:

       •   frame_filter =&gt; $sub

           By default, Devel::StackTrace will include all stack frames before the call to its constructor.

           However,  you  may  want  to  filter  out  some frames with more granularity than 'ignore_package' or
           'ignore_class' allow.

           You can provide a subroutine which is called with the raw frame data for each frame. This is  a  hash
           reference  with  two keys, "caller", and "args", both of which are array references. The "caller" key
           is the raw data as returned by Perl's "caller" function,  and  the  "args"  key  are  the  subroutine
           arguments found in @DB::args.

           The filter should return true if the frame should be included, or false if it should be skipped.

       •   filter_frames_early =&gt; $boolean

           If  this  parameter  is true, "frame_filter" will be called as soon as the stacktrace is created, and
           before refs are stringified (if "unsafe_ref_capture" is not set), rather than being  filtered  lazily
           when Devel::StackTrace::Frame objects are first needed.

           This  is  useful  if you want to filter based on the frame's arguments and want to be able to examine
           object properties, for example.

       •   ignore_package =&gt; $package_name OR \@package_names

           Any frames where the package is one of these packages will not be on the stack.

       •   ignore_class =&gt; $package_name OR \@package_names

           Any frames where the package is a subclass of one of these packages (or is the same package) will not
           be on the stack.

           Devel::StackTrace internally  adds  itself  to  the  'ignore_package'  parameter,  meaning  that  the
           Devel::StackTrace  package  is <b>ALWAYS</b> ignored. However, if you create a subclass of Devel::StackTrace
           it will not be ignored.

       •   skip_frames =&gt; $integer

           This will cause this number of stack frames to be excluded from top of the stack trace. This prevents
           the frames from being captured at all, and applies before the  "frame_filter",  "ignore_package",  or
           "ignore_class" options, even with "filter_frames_early".

       •   unsafe_ref_capture =&gt; $boolean

           If  this  parameter  is true, then Devel::StackTrace will store references internally when generating
           stacktrace frames.

           <b>This</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous,</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> <b>exception</b>  <b>objects</b>.  Using  this  option
           will  keep  any  objects or references alive past their normal lifetime, until the stack trace object
           goes out of scope. It can keep objects alive even after their "DESTROY" sub is called,  resulting  it
           it being called multiple times on the same object.

           If not set, Devel::StackTrace replaces any references with their stringified representation.

       •   no_args =&gt; $boolean

           If  this  parameter  is  true,  then Devel::StackTrace will not store caller arguments in stack trace
           frames at all.

       •   respect_overload =&gt; $boolean

           By  default,  Devel::StackTrace  will  call  "overload::AddrRef"  to  get   the   underlying   string
           representation  of  an object, instead of respecting the object's stringification overloading. If you
           would prefer to see the overloaded representation of objects in stack traces, then set this parameter
           to true.

       •   max_arg_length =&gt; $integer

           By default, Devel::StackTrace will display the entire argument for each subroutine call. Setting this
           parameter causes truncates each subroutine argument's string representation if it is longer than this
           number of characters.

       •   message =&gt; $string

           By default, Devel::StackTrace will use 'Trace begun' as the message for the first  stack  frame  when
           you call "as_string". You can supply an alternative message using this option.

       •   indent =&gt; $boolean

           If  this  parameter  is  true, each stack frame after the first will start with a tab character, just
           like "Carp::confess".

   <b>$trace-&gt;next_frame</b>
       Returns the next Devel::StackTrace::Frame object on the stack, going down.  If this  method  hasn't  been
       called  before it returns the first frame. It returns "undef" when it reaches the bottom of the stack and
       then resets its pointer so the next  call  to  "$trace-&gt;next_frame"  or  "$trace-&gt;prev_frame"  will  work
       properly.

   <b>$trace-&gt;prev_frame</b>
       Returns  the  next  Devel::StackTrace::Frame  object  on  the stack, going up. If this method hasn't been
       called before it returns the last frame. It returns undef when it reaches the top of the stack  and  then
       resets its pointer so the next call to "$trace-&gt;next_frame" or "$trace-&gt;prev_frame" will work properly.

   <b>$trace-&gt;reset_pointer</b>
       Resets  the  pointer  so that the next call to "$trace-&gt;next_frame" or "$trace-&gt;prev_frame" will start at
       the top or bottom of the stack, as appropriate.

   <b>$trace-&gt;frames</b>
       When this method is called with no arguments, it returns a list of Devel::StackTrace::Frame objects. They
       are returned in order from top (most recent) to bottom.

       This method can also be used to set the object's frames if you pass it a list of Devel::StackTrace::Frame
       objects.

       This is useful if you want to filter the list of frames in ways that are more complex than can be handled
       by the "$trace-&gt;filter_frames" method:

         $stacktrace-&gt;frames( my_filter( $stacktrace-&gt;frames ) );

   <b>$trace-&gt;frame($index)</b>
       Given an index, this method returns the relevant frame, or undef if there is no frame at that index.  The
       index is exactly like a Perl array. The first frame is 0 and negative indexes are allowed.

   <b>$trace-&gt;frame_count</b>
       Returns the number of frames in the trace object.

   <b>$trace-&gt;as_string(\%p)</b>
       Calls  "$frame-&gt;as_string"  on  each frame from top to bottom, producing output quite similar to the Carp
       module's cluck/confess methods.

       The optional "\%p"  parameter  only  has  one  option.  The  "max_arg_length"  parameter  truncates  each
       subroutine argument's string representation if it is longer than this number of characters.

       If  all  the frames in a trace are skipped then this just returns the "message" passed to the constructor
       or the string "Trace begun".

   <b>$trace-&gt;message</b>
       Returns the message passed to the constructor. If this wasn't passed then this method returns "undef".
