       Devel::DollarAt - Give magic abilities to $@

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Devel::DollarAt;

           eval "0/0";
           print $@, $@-&gt;backtrace;
           $@-&gt;redie;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Using eval {}, you may catch Perl exceptions almost like you do it with try {} in Java.  However there
       are days when you miss some features of exceptions.  The only thing you know about the error that occured
       is the string $@, which combines the error message and technical data like the line number.

       The Devel::DollarAt module gives some functionality to the $@ scalar.  Once you say "use
       Devel::DollarAt", the module is active program-wide.  If an exception occurs anywhere in any module, $@
       will be globally set to an object of class Devel::DollarAt.  Apart from performance, this shouldn't be a
       problem because $@ tries to be downwardly compatible to the normal $@.  However using this package in
       CPAN modules or large software projects is discouraged.

</pre><h4><b>DISCLAIMER</b></h4><pre>
       Use this module only for debugging.  Don't think of it as an exception framework for Perl or something
       like that.  It just gives magic abilities to $@, that's all.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       backtrace
               Returns a Devel::Backtrace object, which lets you inspect the callers of the fatality.

       filename
               Returns the name of the file in which the error occured.

       inputhandle
               Returns the file handle which has most recently be read from at the time of the error.

       inputline
               Returns the line number of "$@-&gt;inputhandle" (which is $.) at the time of the error.

       line    Returns the number of the line in which the error occured.

       redie   Redispatches this exception to the next eval{}.

       redispatch_points
               Returns  a  list  of  objects  with information about when this exception was redispatched.  Each
               object has got the accessors "package", "filename" and "line".  In string  context,  the  objects
               will look like "redispatched from FooPackage at file.pl:17\n".

       to_string
               Returns  a  string that looks quite like the normal $@, e. g. "Illegal division by zero at foo.pl
               line 42, &lt;&gt; line 13."  Devel::DollarAt  overloads  the  ""  (stringification)  operator  to  this
               method.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       A very simple (and pointless) way to use Devel::DollarAt is this oneliner:

           perl -MDevel::DollarAt -e '0/0'

       It  bails  out  with "Illegal division by zero at -e line 1." and an exit status of 1, just like it would
       have done if you hadn't supplied -MDevel::DollarAt.  This is because the magically modified  $@  variable
       gets stringified when perl prints it as exit reason.  If you actually want to see the difference, use

           perl -MDevel::DollarAt=frame -e '0/0'

       This  bails  out  with  "[[Illegal  division  by  zero at -e line 1.]]" so you can see that something has
       happened.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>PROBLEMS</b></h4><pre>
       This module requires that no other code tampers with $SIG{__DIE__} or *CORE::GLOBAL::die.

       A not widely known feature of Perl is that it can propagate $@.  If you call <b>die()</b> without parameters  or
       with  an empty string or an undefined value, the error message will be "Died".  However, if $@ was set to
       some value before this, the previous error message will be used with "\t...propagated" appended:

           perl -e '$@="7"; die"
           7       ...propagated at -e line 1.

       Devel::DollarAt emulates this behaviour.

       If you use the above example but leave out the double quotes, perl's behaviour is different as of version
       5.8.8:

           perl -e '$@=7; die'
           7 at -e line 1.

       Devel::DollarAt does not emulate this behaviour:

           perl -MDevel::DollarAt -e '$@=7; die'
           7       ...propagated at -e line 1.

       If a previous $@ is propagated, inputhandle and inputline won't work.  They won't  be  interpolated  into
       the stringified $@, either.

       If  perl  comes  across syntax errors, $@ appears to be just a string as usual.  Apparently $SIG{__DIE__}
       won't be called for syntax errors.
