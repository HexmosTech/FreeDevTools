</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "Devel::MAT::Tool::Identify" - identify an SV by its referrers

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This "Devel::MAT" tool provides a command to identify an SV by walking up its tree of inrefs, printing
       useful information that helps to identify what it is by how it can be reached from well-known program
       roots.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>identify</b>
          pmat&gt; identify 0x1bbf640
          IO() at 0x1bbf640 is:
          └─the io of GLOB(@*I) at 0x1bbf628, which is:
            └─the ARGV GV

       Prints a tree of the identification of the SV at the given address.

       Takes the following named options:

       --depth D, -d D
           Limits the output to the given number of steps away from the given initial SV.

       --weak
           Include weak direct references in the output (by default only strong direct ones will be included).

       --all
           Include both weak and indirect references in the output.

       --no-elide, -n
           Don't elide structure in the output.

           By  default, REF()-type SVs will be skipped over, leading to a shorter neater output by removing this
           usually-unnecessary noise. If this option is not given, elided  reference  SVs  will  be  notated  by
           adding "(via RV)" to the reference description.

           Additionally,  members  of  the  symbol  table will be printed as being root SVs, noting their symbol
           table name. This avoids additional nesting due to the stashes and  globs  that  make  up  the  symbol
           table.  This  can also cause SVs to be recognised as symbol table entries, when without it they might
           be cut off due to the depth limit.
