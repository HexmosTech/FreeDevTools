             THRESH is a threshold value used to decide if scaling should be done
             based on the ratio of the scaling factors.  If SCOND &lt; THRESH,
             scaling is done.

             LARGE and SMALL are threshold values used to decide if scaling should
             be done based on the absolute size of the largest matrix element.
             If AMAX &gt; LARGE or AMAX &lt; SMALL, scaling is done.

            using Level 1 and 2 BLAS. where R and L are unknown M-by-N matrices,
            (A, D), (B, E) and (C, F) are given matrix pairs of size M-by-M,
            N-by-N and M-by-N, respectively, with real entries. (A, D) and (B, E)
            must be in generalized Schur canonical form, i.e. A, B are upper
            quasi triangular and D, E are upper triangular. The solution (R, L)
            overwrites (C, F). 0 &lt;= SCALE &lt;= 1 is an output scaling factor
            chosen to avoid overflow.

            In matrix notation solving equation (1) corresponds to solve
            Z*x = scale*b, where Z is defined as

                   Z = [ kron(In, A)  -kron(B**T, Im) ]             (2)
                       [ kron(In, D)  -kron(E**T, Im) ],

            Ik is the identity matrix of size k and X**T is the transpose of X.
            kron(X, Y) is the Kronecker product between the matrices X and Y.
            In the process of solving (1), we solve a number of such systems
            where Dim(In), Dim(In) = 1 or 2.

            If TRANS = 'T', solve the transposed system Z**T*y = scale*b for y,
            which is equivalent to solve for R and L in

                        A**T * R  + D**T * L   = scale * C           (3)
                        R  * B**T + L  * E**T  = scale * -F

            This case is used to compute an estimate of Dif[(A, D), (B, E)] =
            sigma_min(Z) using reverse communication with SLACON.

            STGSY2 also (IJOB &gt;= 1) contributes to the computation in STGSYL
            of an upper bound on the separation between to matrix pairs. Then
            the input (A, D), (B, E) are sub-pencils of the matrix pair in
            STGSYL. See STGSYL for details.
