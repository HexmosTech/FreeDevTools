</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::BDD::Cucumber::Harness - Base class for creating harnesses

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.87

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Harnesses allow your feature files to be executed while telling the outside world about how the testing
       is going, and what's being tested. This is a base class for creating new harnesses. You can see
       Test::BDD::Cucumber::Harness::TermColor and Test::BDD::Cucumber::Harness::TAP for examples, although if
       you need to interact with the results in a more exciting way, you'd be best off interacting with
       Test::BDD::Cucumber::Harness::Data.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b> <b>/</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>feature</b>
   <b>feature_done</b>
       Called at the start and end of feature execution respectively. Both methods accept a single argument of a
       Test::BDD::Cucumber::Model::Feature.

   <b>background</b>
   <b>background_done</b>
       If you have a background section, then we execute it as a quasi-scenario step before each scenario. These
       hooks are fired before and after that, and passed in the Test::BDD::Cucumber::Model::Scenario that
       represents the Background section, and a a dataset hash (although why would you use that?)

   <b>scenario</b>
   <b>scenario_done</b>
       Called at the start and end of scenario execution respectively. Both methods accept a
       Test::BDD::Cucumber::Model::Scenario module and a dataset hash.

   <b>scenario_skip</b>
       Called instead of "scenario" and "scenario_done" when a scenario is skipped.  Although the only reason
       for skipping scenarios currently is being excluded due to tag expressions, this may change in the future.

   <b>step</b>
   <b>step_done</b>
       Called at the start and end of step execution respectively. Both methods accept a
       Test::BDD::Cucumber::StepContext object. "step_done" also accepts a Test::BDD::Cucumber::Model::Result
       object and an arrayref of arrayrefs with locations of consolidated matches, for highlighting.

        [ [2,5], [7,9] ]

   <b>sub_step</b>
   <b>sub_step_done</b>
       As per "step" and "step_done", but for steps that have been called from other steps. None of the included
       harnesses respond to these methods, because generally the whole thing should be transparent, and the
       parent step handles passes, failures, etc.

   <b>startup</b>
   <b>shutdown</b>
       Some tests will run one feature, some will run many. For this reason, you may have harnesses that have
       something they need to do on start (print an HTML header), that they shouldn't do at the start of every
       feature, or a close-down task (like running done_testing()), that again shouldn't happen on <u>every</u> feature
       close-out, just the last.

       Just $self as the single argument for both.

   <b>add_result</b>
       Called before "step_done" with the step's result. Expected to silently add the result in to a pool that
       facilitate the "result" method. No need to override this behaviour.

   <b>result</b>
       Returns a collective view on the passing status of all steps run so far, as a
       Test::BDD::Cucumber::Model::Result object. Default implementation should be fine for all your needs.
