</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::Fu - file and directory objects

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       The directory constructor:

         use File::Fu;

         my $dir = File::Fu-&gt;dir("bar");
         print "$dir\n"; # 'bar/'

         my $file = $dir + 'bar.txt';
         print "$file\n"; # 'bar/bar.txt'

         my $d2 = $dir % 'baz'; # 'barbaz/'
         my $d3 = $dir / 'bat'; # 'bar/bat/'

         my $file2 = $dir / 'bat' + 'foo.txt'; # 'bar/bat/foo.txt'

       The file constructor:

         my $file = File::Fu-&gt;file("foo");
         $file-&gt;e and warn "$file exists";
         $file-&gt;l and warn "$file is a link";
         warn "file is in ", $file-&gt;dir;

</pre><h4><b>ABOUT</b></h4><pre>
       This class provides the toplevel interface to File::Fu directory and file objects, with operator
       overloading which allows precise path composition and support for most builtin methods, as well as
       creation of temporary files/directories, finding files, and more.

       The interface and style are quite different than the perl builtins or File::Spec.  The syntax is concise.
       Errors are thrown with <b>croak()</b>, so you never need to check a return code.

</pre><h4><b>Constructors</b></h4><pre>
       The actual objects are in the 'Dir' and 'File' sub-namespaces.

   <b>dir</b>
         my $dir = File::Fu-&gt;dir($path);

       See "new" in File::Fu::Dir

   <b>file</b>
         my $file = File::Fu-&gt;file($path);

       See "new" in File::Fu::File

</pre><h4><b>Class</b> <b>Constants</b></h4><pre>
   <b>tmp</b>
       Your system's '<a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>' directory (or equivalent of that.)

         my $dir = File::Fu-&gt;tmp;

   <b>home</b>
       User's $HOME directory.

         my $dir = File::Fu-&gt;home;

   <b>program_name</b>
       The absolute name of your program.  This will be relative from the time File::Fu was loaded.  It dies if
       the name is '-e'.

         my $prog = File::Fu-&gt;program_name;

       If File::Fu was loaded after a chdir and the $0 was relative, calling <b>program_name()</b> throws an error.
       (Unless you set $0 correctly before requiring File::Fu.)

   <b>program_dir</b>
       Returns what typically corresponds to <b>program_name()</b>-&gt;dirname, but just the compile-time <b>cwd()</b> when $0 is
       -e/-E.

         my $dir = File::Fu-&gt;program_dir;

</pre><h4><b>Class</b> <b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
   <b>THIS_FILE</b>
       A nicer way to say __FILE__.

         my $file = File::Fu-&gt;THIS_FILE;

   <b>cwd</b>
       The current working directory.

         my $dir = File::Fu-&gt;cwd;

   <b>which</b>
       Returns File::Fu::File objects of ordered candidates for $name found in the path.

         my @prog = File::Fu-&gt;which($name) or die "cannot find $name";

       If called in scalar context, returns a single File::Fu::File object or throws an error if no candidates
       were found.

         my $prog = File::Fu-&gt;which($name);

</pre><h4><b>Temporary</b> <b>Directories</b> <b>and</b> <b>Files</b></h4><pre>
       These class methods call the corresponding File::Fu::Dir methods on the value of <b>tmp()</b>.  That is, you get
       a temporary file/dir in the '<a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>' directory.

   <b>temp_dir</b>
         my $dir = File::Fu-&gt;temp_dir;

   <b>temp_file</b>
         my $handle = File::Fu-&gt;temp_file;

</pre><h4><b>Operators</b></h4><pre>
       If you choose not to use the overloaded operators, you can just say "$obj-&gt;stringify()" or "$obj"
       whenever you want to drop the object-y nature and treat the path as a string.

       The operators can be convenient for building-up path names, but you probably don't want to think of them
       as "math on filenames", because they are nothing like that.

       The '+' and '/' operators only apply to directory objects.

         op   method                     mnemonic
         --   ----------------           --------------------
         +    $d-&gt;file($b) ............. plus (not "add")
         /    $d-&gt;subdir($b) ........... slash (not "divide")

       The other operators apply to both files and directories.

         op   method                     mnemonic
         --   ----------------           --------------------
         %=   $p-&gt;append($b) ........... mod(ify)
         %    $p-&gt;clone-&gt;append($b)
         &amp;=   $p-&gt;map(sub{...}) ........ invoke subref
         &amp;    $p-&gt;clone-&gt;map(sub {...})

       Aside:  It would be more natural to use ".=" as <b>append()</b>, but the way perl compiles "$obj foo" into "$obj
       . " foo"" makes it impossible to do the right thing because the lines between object and string are too
       ambiguous.

</pre><h4><b>Subclassing</b></h4><pre>
       You may wish to subclass File:Fu and override the <b>dir_class()</b> and/or <b>file_class()</b> class methods to point
       to your own Dir/File subclasses.

         my $class = 'My::FileFu';
         my $dir = $class-&gt;dir("foo");

       See File::Fu::File and File::Fu::Dir for more info.

   <b>dir_class</b>
         File::Fu-&gt;dir_class # File::Fu::Dir

   <b>file_class</b>
         File::Fu-&gt;file_class # File::Fu::File

</pre><h4><b>See</b> <b>Also</b></h4><pre>
       File::Fu::why if I need to explain my motivations.

       Path::Class, from which many an idea was taken.
