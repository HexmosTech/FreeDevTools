       TAP::Parser::Scheduler - Schedule tests during parallel testing

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 3.48

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use TAP::Parser::Scheduler;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Class</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <u>"new"</u>

           my $sched = TAP::Parser::Scheduler-&gt;new(tests =&gt; \@tests);
           my $sched = TAP::Parser::Scheduler-&gt;new(
               tests =&gt; [ ['t/test_name.t','Test Description'], ... ],
               rules =&gt; \%rules,
           );

       Given 'tests' and optional 'rules' as input, returns a new "TAP::Parser::Scheduler" object.  Each member
       of @tests should be either a a test file name, or a two element arrayref, where the first element is a
       test file name, and the second element is a test description. By default, we'll use the test name as the
       description.

       The optional "rules" attribute provides direction on which tests should be run in parallel and which
       should be run sequentially. If no rule data structure is provided, a default data structure is used which
       makes every test eligible to be run in parallel:

           { par =&gt; '**' },

       The rules data structure is documented more in the next section.

   <b>Rules</b> <b>data</b> <b>structure</b>
       The ""rules"" data structure is the the heart of the scheduler. It allows you to express simple rules
       like "run all tests in sequence" or "run all tests in parallel except these five tests.". However, the
       rules structure also supports glob-style pattern matching and recursive definitions, so you can also
       express arbitarily complicated patterns.

       The rule must only have one top level key: either 'par' for "parallel" or 'seq' for "sequence".

       Values must be either strings with possible glob-style matching, or arrayrefs of strings or hashrefs
       which follow this pattern recursively.

       Every element in an arrayref directly below a 'par' key is eligible to be run in parallel, while vavalues
       directly below a 'seq' key must be run in sequence.

       <u>Rules</u> <u>examples</u>

       Here are some examples:

           # All tests be run in parallel (the default rule)
           { par =&gt; '**' },

           # Run all tests in sequence, except those starting with "p"
           { par =&gt; 't/p*.t' },

           # Run all tests in parallel, except those starting with "p"
           {
               seq =&gt; [
                         { seq =&gt; 't/p*.t' },
                         { par =&gt; '**'     },
                      ],
           }

           # Run some  startup tests in sequence, then some parallel tests then some
           # teardown tests in sequence.
           {
               seq =&gt; [
                   { seq =&gt; 't/startup/*.t' },
                   { par =&gt; ['t/a/*.t','t/b/*.t','t/c/*.t'], }
                   { seq =&gt; 't/shutdown/*.t' },
               ],
           },

       <u>Rules</u> <u>resolution</u>

       •   By  default,  all  tests are eligible to be run in parallel. Specifying any of your own rules removes
           this one.

       •   "First match wins". The first rule that matches a test will be the one that applies.

       •   Any test which does not match a rule will be run in sequence at the end of the run.

       •   The existence of a rule does not imply selecting a test. You must still specify the tests to run.

       •   Specifying a rule to allow tests to run in parallel does not make the run in parallel. You still need
           specify the number of parallel "jobs" in your Harness object.

       <u>Glob-style</u> <u>pattern</u> <u>matching</u> <u>for</u> <u>rules</u>

       We implement our own glob-style pattern matching. Here are the patterns it supports:

           ** is any number of characters, including /, within a pathname
           * is zero or more characters within a filename/directory name
           ? is exactly one character within a filename/directory name
           {foo,bar,baz} is any of foo, bar or baz.
           \ is an escape character

   <b>Instance</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <u>"get_all"</u>

       Get a list of all remaining tests.

       <u>"get_job"</u>

       Return the next available job as TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Job object or "undef"  if  none  are  available.
       Returns  a TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Spinner if the scheduler still has pending jobs but none are available
       to run right now.

       <u>"as_string"</u>

       Return a human readable representation of the scheduling tree.  For example:

           my @tests = (qw{
               t/startup/foo.t
               t/shutdown/foo.t

               t/a/foo.t t/b/foo.t t/c/foo.t t/d/foo.t
           });
           my $sched = TAP::Parser::Scheduler-&gt;new(
               tests =&gt; \@tests,
               rules =&gt; {
                   seq =&gt; [
                       { seq =&gt; 't/startup/*.t' },
                       { par =&gt; ['t/a/*.t','t/b/*.t','t/c/*.t'] },
                       { seq =&gt; 't/shutdown/*.t' },
                   ],
               },
           );

       Produces:

           par:
             seq:
               par:
                 seq:
                   par:
                     seq:
                       't/startup/foo.t'
                   par:
                     seq:
                       't/a/foo.t'
                     seq:
                       't/b/foo.t'
                     seq:
                       't/c/foo.t'
                   par:
                     seq:
                       't/shutdown/foo.t'
               't/d/foo.t'
