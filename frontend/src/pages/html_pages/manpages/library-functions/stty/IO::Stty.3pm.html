</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       IO::Stty - Change and print terminal line settings

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # calling the script directly
           stty.pl [setting...]
           stty.pl {-a,-g,-v,--version}

           # Calling Stty module
           use IO::Stty;
           IO::Stty::stty(\*TTYHANDLE, @modes);

            use IO::Stty;
            $old_mode=IO::Stty::stty(\*STDIN,'-g');

            # Turn off echoing.
            IO::Stty::stty(\*STDIN,'-echo');

            # Do whatever.. grab input maybe?
            $read_password = &lt;&gt;;

            # Now restore the old mode.
            IO::Stty::stty(\*STDIN,$old_mode);

            # What settings do we have anyway?
            print IO::Stty::stty(\*STDIN,'-a');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the PERL POSIX compliant stty.

</pre><h4><b>INTRO</b></h4><pre>
       This has not been tailored to the IO::File stuff but will work with it as indicated. Before you go
       futzing with term parameters it's a good idea to grab the current settings and restore them when you
       finish.

       stty accepts the following non-option arguments that change aspects of the terminal line operation. A
       `[-]' before a capability means that it can be turned off by preceding it with a `-'.

</pre><h4><b>stty</b> <b>parameters</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Control</b> <b>settings</b>
       [-]parenb
           Generate parity bit in output and expect parity bit in input.

       [-]ixoff
           Enable  sending  of  stop  character when the system input buffer is almost full, and start character
           when it becomes almost empty again.

   <b>Output</b> <b>settings</b>
       [-]opost
           Postprocess output.

       [-]isig

           Echo erase characters as backspace-space-backspace.

       [-]echok
           Echo a newline after a kill character.

       [-]noflsh
           Disable flushing after interrupt and quit special characters.

           * Though this claims non-posixhood it is supported by the perl POSIX.pm.

       [-]tostop (np)
           Stop background jobs that try to write to the terminal.

   <b>Combination</b> <b>settings</b>
       ek  Reset the erase and kill special characters to their default values.

       sane
           Same as:

               cread -ignbrk brkint -inlcr -igncr icrnl -ixoff opost
               isig icanon echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh -tostop

           also sets all special characters to their default values.

       [-]cooked
           Same as:

               brkint ignpar istrip icrnl ixon opost isig icanon

           plus sets the eof and eol characters to their default values if they are the same as the min and time
           characters.  With `-', same as raw.

       [-]raw
           Same as:

               -ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr
               -icrnl -ixon -ixoff -opost -isig -icanon min 1 time 0

           With `-', same as cooked.

       [-]pass8
           Same as:

               -parenb -istrip cs8

           With  `-',  same  as parenb istrip cs7.

       dec Same as:

               echoe echoctl echoke -ixany

           Also sets the interrupt special character to Ctrl-C, erase to Del, and kill to Ctrl-U.

   <b>Special</b> <b>characters</b>
       The special characters' default values vary from system to system. They are set  with  the  syntax  `name
       value',  where  the  names  are listed below and the value can be given either literally, in hat notation
       (`^c'), or as an integer which may start with `0x' to indicate hexadecimal, `0' to indicate octal, or any
       other digit to indicate decimal.  Giving a value of `^-' or `undef' disables that special character.

       intr
           Send an interrupt signal.

       quit
           Send a quit signal.

       erase
           Erase the last character typed.

       kill
           Erase the current line.

       eof Send an end of file (terminate the input).

       eol End the line.

       start
           Restart the output after stopping it.

       stop
           Stop the output.

       susp
           Send a terminal stop signal.

   <b>Special</b> <b>settings</b>
       min N
           Set the minimum number of characters that will satisfy a read until the time value has expired,  when
           &lt;E&gt;-icanon&lt;E&gt; is set.

       time N
           Set the number of tenths of a second before reads time out if the min number of characters  have  not
           been read, when -icanon is set.

       N   Set the input and output speeds to N.  N can be one of: 0 50 75 110 134 134.5 150 200  300  600  1200
           1800  2400  4800 9600 19200 38400 exta extb.  exta is  the same  as 19200; extb is the same as 38400.
           0 hangs up the line if -clocal is set.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       -a  Print all current settings in human-readable  form.

       -g  Print all current settings in a form  that  can  be used  as  an  argument  to  another stty  command
           to restore the current settings.

       -v,--version
           Print version info.

           From comments:

               I'm not feeling very inspired about this. Terminal parameters are obscure
               and boring. Basically what this will do is get the current setting,
               take the parameters, modify the setting and write it back. Zzzz.
               This is not especially efficent and probably not too fast. Assuming the POSIX
               spec has been implemented properly it should mostly work.

       This  is  use  at  your own risk software. Do anything you want with it except blame me for it blowing up
       your machine because it's full of bugs.

       See above for what functions are supported. It's mostly standard POSIX stuff. If any of the settings  are
       wrong  and  you actually know what some of these extremely arcane settings (like what 'sane' should be in
       POSIX land) really should be, please open an RT ticket.
