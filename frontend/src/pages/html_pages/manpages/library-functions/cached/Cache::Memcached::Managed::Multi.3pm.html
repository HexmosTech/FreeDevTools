</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi - multiple Cache::Memcache::Managed objects

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi;

        my $multi = Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi-&gt;new( @managed );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Provides the same API as Cache::Memcached::Managed, but applies all methods called to all of the objects
       specified, except for new and objects.

</pre><h4><b>CONTEXT</b></h4><pre>
       All methods are called on all of the Cache::Memcached::Managed objects in the same context (list, scalar
       or void) in which the method is called on the Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi object.  The return value
       differs in format depending on the context also:

       scalar
          my $listref = $multi-&gt;method;
          print "Result: @{$listref}\n";

         When called in scalar context, a list ref with scalar values is returned in the same order in which the
         objects are used (which is determined by the order in which they were supplied with new and returned by
         objects..

       list
          my @listref = $multi-&gt;method;
          print "Result $_: @{$listref[$_]}\n" foreach 0..$#listref;

         When  called  in  list  context,  a  list of list references is returned in the same order in which the
         objects are used (which is determined by the order in which they were supplied with new and returned by
         objects.

       void
          $multi-&gt;method;

         When called in void context, nothing is returned (not strangely enough ;-).

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       There is only one specific class method.

   <b>new</b>
        my $multi = Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi-&gt;new( @managed );

       Create an object containing multiple Cache::Memcached::Managed objects.  Returns the instantiated object.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>INSTANCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>objects</b>
        my @managed = $multi-&gt;objects;

       Returns the list of instantiated Cache::Memcached::Managed objects that the object is a proxy for.
