</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTTP::Cache::Transparent - Cache the result of http get-requests persistently.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use LWP::Simple;
         use HTTP::Cache::Transparent;

         HTTP::Cache::Transparent::init( {
           BasePath =&gt; '/tmp/cache',
         } );

         my $data = get( '<a href="http://www.sn.no">http://www.sn.no</a>' );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An implementation of http get that keeps a local cache of fetched pages to avoid fetching the same data
       from the server if it hasn't been updated. The cache is stored on disk and is thus persistent between
       invocations.

       Uses the http-headers If-Modified-Since and ETag to let the server decide if the version in the cache is
       up-to-date or not.

       The cache is implemented by modifying the LWP::UserAgent class to seamlessly cache the result of all
       requests that can be cached.

</pre><h4><b>INITIALIZING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>CACHE</b></h4><pre>
       HTTP::Cache::Transparent provides an init-method that sets the parameters for the cache and overloads a
       method in LWP::UserAgent to activate the cache.After init has been called, the normal LWP-methods
       (LWP::Simple as well as the more full-fledged LWP::Request methods) should be used as usual.

       init
           Initialize  the HTTP cache. Takes a single parameter which is a hashref containing named arguments to
           the object.

             HTTP::Cache::Transparent::init( {

               # Directory to store the cache in.
               BasePath  =&gt; "/tmp/cache",

               # How many hours should items be kept in the cache
               # after they were last requested?
               # Default is 8*24.
               MaxAge    =&gt; 8*24,

               # Print progress-messages to STDERR.
               # Default is 0.
               Verbose   =&gt; 1,

               # If a request is made for a url that has been requested
               # from the server less than NoUpdate seconds ago, the
               # response will be generated from the cache without
               # contacting the server.
               # Default is 0.
               NoUpdate  =&gt; 15*60,

               # When a url has been downloaded and the response indicates that
               # has been modified compared to the content in the cache,
               # the ApproveContent callback is called with the HTTP::Response.
               # The callback shall return true if the response shall be used and
               # stored in the cache or false if the response shall be discarded
               # and the response in the cache used instead.
               # This mechanism can be used to work around servers that return errors
               # intermittently. The default is to accept all responses.
               ApproveContent =&gt; sub { return $_[0]-&gt;is_success },
            } );

           The directory where the cache is stored must be writable. It must also only contain files created  by
           HTTP::Cache::Transparent.

       Initializing from use-line
           An  alternative way of initializing HTTP::Cache::Transparent is to supply parameters in the use-line.
           This allows you to write

             use HTTP::Cache::Transparent ( BasePath =&gt; '/tmp/cache' );

           which is exactly equivalent to

             use HTTP::Cache::Transparent;
             HTTP::Cache::Transparent::init( BasePath =&gt; '/tmp/cache' );

           The advantage to using this method is that you can do

             perl -MHTTP::Cache::Transparent=BasePath,/tmp/cache myscript.pl

           or even set the environment variable PERL5OPT

             PERL5OPT=-MHTTP::Cache::Transparent=BasePath,/tmp/cache
             myscript.pl

           and have all the http-requests performed  by  myscript.pl  go  through  the  cache  without  changing
           myscript.pl

</pre><h4><b>INSPECTING</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>BEHAVIOR</b></h4><pre>
       The  HTTP::Cache::Transparent  inserts  three  special headers in the HTTP::Response object. These can be
       accessed via the <b>HTTP::Response::header()</b>-method.

       X-Cached
           This header is inserted and set to 1 if the response is delivered from the cache instead of from  the
           server.

       X-Content-Unchanged
           This  header is inserted and set to 1 if the content returned is the same as the content returned the
           last time this url was fetched. This header is always inserted and set to  1  when  the  response  is
           delivered from the cache.

       X-No-Server-Contact
           This  header  is inserted and set to 1 if the content returned has been delivered without any contact
           with the external server, i.e. no conditional or unconditional HTTP GET request has  been  sent,  the
           content has been delivered directly from cache. This may be useful when seeking to control loading of
           the external server.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This module has a number of limitations that you should be aware of before using it.

       -   There is no upper limit to how much diskspace the cache requires. The only limiting mechanism is that
           data for urls that haven't been requested in the last MaxAge hours will be removed from the cache the
           next time the program exits.

       -   Currently,  only get-requests that store the result in memory (i.e. do not use the option to have the
           result stored directly in a file or delivered via a callback) is cached.  I  intend  to  remove  this
           limitation in a future version.

       -   The  support  for  Ranges  is  a  bit primitive. It creates a new object in the cache for each unique
           combination of url and range. This will work ok as long as you always request the same range(s) for a
           url.

       -   The cache doesn't properly check and store all headers in the HTTP request and  response.  Therefore,
           if you request the same url repeatedly with different sets of headers (cookies, accept-encoding etc),
           and these headers affect the response from the server, the cache may return the wrong response.

       -   HTTP::Cache::Transparent  has  not been tested with threads, and will most likely not work if you use
           them.

</pre><h4><b>CACHE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The cache is stored on disk as one file per cached object. The filename is equal to the md5sum of the url
       and the Range-header if it exists.  The file contains a set of key/value-pairs with metadata  (one  entry
       per line) followed by a blank line and then the actual data returned by the server.

       The last modified date of the cache file is set to the time when the cache object was last requested by a
       user.
