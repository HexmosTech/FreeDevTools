       Cache::Mmap - Shared data cache using memory mapped files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Cache::Mmap;

         $cache=Cache::Mmap-&gt;new($filename,\%options);

         $val1=$cache-&gt;read($key1);
         $cache-&gt;write($key2,$val2);
         $cache-&gt;delete($key3);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements a shared data cache, using memory mapped files.  If routines are provided which
       interact with the underlying data, access to the cache is completely transparent, and the module handles
       all the details of refreshing cache contents, and updating underlying data, if necessary.

       Cache entries are assigned to "buckets" within the cache file, depending on the key. Within each bucket,
       entries are stored approximately in order of last access, so that frequently accessed entries will move
       to the head of the bucket, thus decreasing access time. Concurrent accesses to the same bucket are
       prevented by file locking of the relevant section of the cache file.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new($filename,\%options)
           Creates  a  new  cache  object.  If  the  file  named by $filename does not already exist, it will be
           created. If the cache object cannot be created for any reason, an exception will be  thrown.  Various
           options may be set in %options, which affect the behaviour of the cache (defaults in parentheses):

           permissions (0600)
               Sets the file permissions for the cache file if it doesn't already exist.

           buckets (13)
               Sets  the  number  of  buckets inside the cache file. A larger number of buckets will give better
               performance for a cache with many accesses, as there will be less chance of concurrent access  to
               the same bucket.

           bucketsize (1024)
               Sets  the size of each bucket, in bytes. A larger bucket size will be needed to store large cache
               entries. If the bucketsize is not large enough to hold a  particular  entry,  it  will  still  be
               passed between the underlying data and the application in its entirety, but will not be stored in
               the cache.

           pagesize (1024)
               Sets the alignment of buckets within the file. The file header will be extended to this size, and
               bucket  sizes  will  be  rounded  up  to  the nearest multiple.  Choosing a pagesize equal to the
               virtual memory page size of the host system should improve performance.

           strings (0)
               If true, cache entries are treated as strings, rather than references. This will help performance
               for string-only caches, as no time will be taken to serialize cache entries.

           expiry (0)
               If non-zero, sets the length of time, in seconds, which cache entries are considered valid. A new
               entry will be fetched from the underlying data if an expired cache  entry  would  otherwise  have
               been returned.

           context (undef)
               This  value  is  passed  to  the  read/write/delete routines below, to provide context. This will
               typically be a database handle, used to fetch data from.

           read (undef)
               Provides a code reference to a routine which will fetch entries from the underlying data.  Called
               as "$read-&gt;($key,$context)", this routine should return a list "($found,$value)", where $found is
               true if the entry could be found in the underlying data, and $value is the value to cache.

               If  the routine only returns a single scalar, that will be taken as the value, and $found will be
               set to true if the value is defined.

               If this routine is not provided, only values already in the cache will ever be returned.

               There are currently two special values of $found which cause slightly different behaviour.  These
               are constants which may be imported in the "use" statement.

               "Cache::Mmap::CMM_keep_expired"
                   Use  the  previously  cached  value, even if it has expired. This is useful if the underlying
                   data source has become unavailable for some reason. Note that even though the value  returned
                   will  be  ignored  in  this  case, it must be returned to avoid $found being interpreted as a
                   single scalar:

                     return (Cache::Mmap::CMM_keep_expired, undef);

               "Cache::Mmap::CMM_keep_expired_refresh"
                   This causes the same behaviour as "CMM_keep_expired", but the cache entry's expiry time  will
                   be reset as if a value had been successfully read from the underlying data.

           cachenegative (0)
               If  true,  even  unsuccessful  fetches from the underlying data are cached. This can be useful to
               only search the underlying data once for each required key.

           write (undef)
               Provides a code reference to a routine which will write cache entries into the  underlying  data.
               This routine will be called by <b>write()</b>, to synchronise the underlying data with the cache. Called
               as  "$write-&gt;($key,$val,$context)".  If the routine is not provided, the underlying data will not
               be synchronised after cache writes.

           writethrough (1)
               If true, the "write" routine above will be called as soon as <b>write()</b>  is  called.  This  provides
               immediate synchronisation of underlying data and cache contents.

               If  false,  the  "write"  routine will be called for each cache entry which no longer fits in its
               bucket after a cache read or write. This provides a write-as-necessary behaviour,  which  may  be
               more efficient than the writethrough behaviour. However, only data fetched through the cache will
               reflect these changes.

           delete (undef)
               Provides  a  code  reference  to a routine which will delete items from the underlying data. This
               routine will be called by <b>delete()</b>, to synchronise the underlying data with the cache. Called  as
               "$delete-&gt;($key,$cval,$context)", where $cval is the value currently stored in the cache. If this
               routine is not provided, entries deleted from the cache have no effect on the underlying data.

           An  alternative  to  supplying  a  "write" routine, is to call <b>delete()</b> after updating the underlying
           data. Note however, that in the case of databases, this should be done after committing  the  update,
           so  that a concurrent process doesn't reload the cache between being the entry being deleted, and the
           database updates being committed.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CACHE</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       These are the everyday methods used to access the data stored by the cache.

       read($key)
           Reads an entry from the cache, or from the underlying data if  not  cached.   Returns  the  value  in
           scalar  context, and "($found,$value)" in list context, where $found is true if the item was found in
           either the cache or the underlying data.

       write($key,$val)
           Writes an entry into the cache, and depending on the configuration, into the underlying data.

       delete($key)
           Deletes an entry from the cache, and depending on new() options, from the underlying  data.   Returns
           the  value in scalar context, and "($found,$value)" in list context, where $found is true if the item
           was found in the cache.

       <b>entries()</b>
       <b><a href="../man0/entries.0.html">entries</a></b>(0)
           Returns a list of the keys of entries held in the cache. Note that this list may be  immediately  out
           of  date,  due  to the shared nature of the cache. Entries may be added or removed by other processes
           between this list being generated and when it is used.

       <b><a href="../man1/entries.1.html">entries</a></b>(1)
           Returns a list of hashrefs representing entries held in the cache. The following keys are present  in
           each hashref:

             key    The key used to identify the entry
             time   The time the entry was stored (seconds since the epoch)
             dirty  Whether the entry needs writing to the underlying data

           The same caveat applies to the currency of this information as above.

       <b><a href="../man2/entries.2.html">entries</a></b>(2)
           As  <a href="../man1/entries.1.html">entries</a>(1),  with  the addition of a "value" element in each hashref, holding the value stored in
           the cache entry.

       <b>quick_clear()</b>
           Forcefully delete the cache, with prejudice. Unwritten dirty elements are <b>not</b>  written  back  to  the
           underlying data source; they are simply thrown away.

   <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       These  methods  are used to examine/update the configuration of a cache.  Most of these methods are read-
       only, and the value returned may be different to that passed to the constructor, since the cache may have
       been created by an earlier process which specified different parameters.

       <b>buckets()</b>
           Returns the number of buckets in the cache file.

       <b>bucketsize()</b>
           Returns the size of buckets (in bytes) in the cache file.

       <b>cachenegative()</b>
           Returns true if items not found in the underlying data are cached anyway.

       <b>context()</b>
           Returns the context data for reads and writes to the underlying data.

       context($context)
           Provides new context data for reads and writes to the underlying data.

       <b>expiry()</b>
           Returns the time in seconds cache entries are considered valid for, or zero for indefinite validity.

       <b>pagesize()</b>
           Returns the page size (in bytes) of the cache file.

       <b>strings()</b>
           Returns true if the cache stores strings rather than references.

       <b>writethrough()</b>
           Returns true if items written to the cache are immediately written to the underlying data.
