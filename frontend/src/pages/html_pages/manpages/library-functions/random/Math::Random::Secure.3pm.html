       Math::Random::Secure - Cryptographically-secure, cross-platform replacement for rand()

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.080001

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        # Replace rand().
        use Math::Random::Secure qw(rand);

        # Get a random number between 0 and 1
        my $float = rand();

        # Get a random integer (faster than int(rand))
        use Math::Random::Secure qw(irand);
        my $int = irand();

        # Random integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.
        $int = <a href="../man10/irand.10.html">irand</a>(10);

        # Random floating-point number greater than or equal to 0.0 and
        # less than 10.0.
        $float = <a href="../man10/rand.10.html">rand</a>(10);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is intended to provide a cryptographically-secure replacement for Perl's built-in "rand"
       function. "Crytographically secure", in this case, means:

       •   No  matter  how  many  numbers you see generated by the random number generator, you cannot guess the
           future numbers, and you cannot guess the seed.

       •   There are so many possible seeds that it would take decades, centuries, or millenia for  an  attacker
           to try them all.

       •   The  seed  comes  from a source that generates relatively strong random data on your platform, so the
           seed itself will be as random as possible.

           See "IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS" for more information about the underlying systems used to implement  all
           of  these  guarantees,  and  some important caveats if you're going to use this module for some very-
           high-security purpose.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>rand</b>
       Should work exactly like Perl's built-in "rand". Will automatically call "srand"  if  "srand"  has  never
       been called in this process or thread.

       There  is  one  limitation--Math::Random::Secure is backed by a 32-bit random number generator. So if you
       are on a 64-bit platform and you specify a limit that is greater than 2^32, you are likely to  get  less-
       random data.

   <b>srand</b>
       <b>Note:</b>  Under  normal  circumstances,  you  should  <b>not</b>  call  this  function,  as "rand" and "irand" will
       automatically call it for you the first time they are used in a thread or process.

       Seeds the random number generator, much like Perl's built-in "srand", except that it uses a  much  larger
       and  more  secure  seed.  The seed should be passed as a string of bytes, at least 8 bytes in length, and
       more ideally between 32 and 64 bytes. (See "seed" in Math::Random::Secure::RNG for more info.)

       If you do not pass a seed, a  seed  will  be  generated  automatically  using  a  secure  mechanism.  See
       "IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS" for more information.

       This function returns the seed that generated (or the seed that was passed in, if you passed one in).

   <b>irand</b>
       Works  somewhat like "rand", except that it returns a 32-bit integer between 0 and 2^32. Should be faster
       than doing "int(rand)".

       Note that because it returns 32-bit integers, specifying a limit greater than 2^32 will have no effect.

</pre><h4><b>IMPLEMENTATION</b> <b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       Currently, Math::Random::Secure is  backed  by  Math::Random::ISAAC,  a  cryptographically-strong  random
       number generator with no known serious weaknesses. If there are significant weaknesses found in ISAAC, we
       will change our backend to a more-secure random number generator. The goal is for Math::Random::Secure to
       be cryptographically strong, not to represent some specific random number generator.

       Math::Random::Secure  seeds  itself  using  Crypt::Random::Source.  The  underlying  implementation  uses
       <u>/dev/urandom</u> on Unix-like platforms, and the "RtlGenRandom" or "CryptGenRandom" functions on Windows 2000
       and above. (There is no support for versions of Windows before Windows 2000.)  If any  of  these  seeding
       sources   are   not   available   and   you   have   other   Crypt::Random::Source   modules   installed,
       Math::Random::Secure will use those other sources to seed itself.

   <b>Making</b> <b>Math::Random::Secure</b> <b>Even</b> <b>More</b> <b>Secure</b>
       We use <u>/dev/urandom</u> on Unix-like systems, because one of the requirements of duplicating "rand"  is  that
       we  never  block  waiting  for  seed  data,  and  <u>/dev/random</u>  could do that. However, it's possible that
       <u>/dev/urandom</u> could run out of "truly random" data and start to  use  its  built-in  pseudo-random  number
       generator  to  generate  data. On most systems, this should still provide a very good seed for nearly all
       uses, but it may not be suitable for very high-security cryptographic circumstances.

       For Windows, there are known issues with "CryptGenRandom" on Windows 2000  and  versions  of  Windows  XP
       before  Service  Pack  3.  However,  there  is  no other built-in method of getting secure random data on
       Windows,  and  I  suspect  that  these  issues  will  not  be  significant  for  most   applications   of
       Math::Random::Secure.

       If   either   of   these   situations   are   a   problem   for   your  use,  you  can  create  your  own
       Math::Random::Secure::RNG object with a different "seeder" argument, and  set  $Math::Random::Secure::RNG
       to    your    own   instance   of   Math::Random::Secure::RNG.   The   "seeder"   is   an   instance   of
       Crypt::Random::Source::Base, which should allow you to use most random-data sources in existence for your
       seeder, should you wish.

   <b>Seed</b> <b>Exhaustion</b>
       Perl's built-in "srand" reads 32 bits from <u>/dev/urandom</u>. By default, we read 512 bits. This means that we
       are more likely to  exhaust  available  truly-random  data  than  the  built-in  "srand"  is,  and  cause
       <u>/dev/urandom</u>  to  fall  back on its psuedo-random number generator. Normally this is not a problem, since
       "srand" is only called once per Perl process or thread, but it is something that you should be  aware  of
       if you are going to be in a situation where you have many new Perl processes or threads and you have very
       high  security  requirements  (on  the order of generating private SSH or GPG keypairs, SSL private keys,
       etc.).

       Math::Random::Secure::RNG
           The underlying random-number generator and seeding code for Math::Random::Secure.

       Crypt::Source::Random
       Crypt::Random
       Math::TrulyRandom
           All of these modules contain generators for "truly random" data, but  they  don't  contain  a  simple
           "rand" replacement and they can be very slow.
