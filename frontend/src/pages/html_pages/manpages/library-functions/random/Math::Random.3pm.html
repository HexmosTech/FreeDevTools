</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Math::Random</b> is  a <b>Perl</b> port  of the  <b>C</b>  version  of  <b>randlib</b>,  which  is    a  suite  of   routines  for
       generating  random deviates.  See "RANDLIB" for more information.

       This  port  supports  all of the distributions  from which the <b>Fortran</b> and <b>C</b>  versions generate deviates.
       The major functionalities that are excluded  are   the   multiple   generators/splitting   facility   and
       antithetic   random  number  generation.   These facilities,  along with some of  the distributions which
       <u>are</u>  included, are probably not of interest   except  to the   very  sophisticated   user.  If there   is
       sufficient interest, the excluded   facilities will be included in   a future  release.    The  code   to
       perform the  excluded facilities  is available as <b>randlib</b> in <b>Fortran</b> and <b>C</b> source.

   <b>Default</b> <b>Routines</b>
       The  routines which are exported by default are  the only ones that the average Perl programmer is likely
       to need.

       random_set_seed_from_phrase($phrase)
           Sets  the  seed   of the  base  generator  to   a  value determined by <u>$phrase</u>.  If   the  module  is
           installed with  the default option, the value depends on the  machine collating sequence.  It should,
           however,  be  the   same  for 7-bit ASCII character  strings on all ASCII machines.  In the  original
           randlib,  the  value   generated  for   a  given  <u>$phrase</u>  was  consistent  from  implementation   to
           implementation   (it  did  not  rely  on  the  machine  collating  sequence).   Check  with your Perl
           administrator to see if the module was installed with the original seed generator.  <b>Note:</b>   When  the
           Perl  processor  loads  package   <b>Math::Random</b>   the seed  is set   to a value  based on  the current
           time.  The seed  changes  each time <b>Math::Random</b>  generates something random.

           The ability to set the seed is useful for debugging,  or for those who like reproducible runs.

       random_get_seed()
           Returns  an   array of  length two   which   contains   the   two  integers  constituting   the  seed
           (assuming    a  call    in  array    context).   An invocation   in  a scalar  context  returns   the
           integer 2, which is probably not useful.

       random_seed_from_phrase($phrase)
           Returns   an  array of  length  two which   contains    the  two  integers  constituting    the  seed
           (assuming  a     call   in  array   context).    An  invocation    in  a scalar  context returns  the
           integer  2, which is probably not useful.  The  seed generated is the seed  used to set the seed in a
           call to "random_set_seed_from_phrase".

           <b>Note:</b>   the  following  two calls  (for   the  same <u>$phrase</u>) are equivalent:

            random_set_seed(random_seed_from_phrase($phrase));

           and

            random_set_seed_from_phrase($phrase);

       random_set_seed(@seed)
           Sets  the  seed  of the  base  generator  to  the value <u>@seed</u>[0,1].  Usually,  the   argument   <u>@seed</u>
           should  be   the  result  of  a  call to "random_get_seed"  or "random_seed_from_phrase".  <u>@seed</u>[0,1]
           must be two integers in the range (1, 1) to (2147483562, 2147483398), inclusive.

       "random_uniform($n, $low, $high)"
       random_uniform($n)
       random_uniform()
           When  called   in  an  array  context,   returns  an  array  of   <u>$n</u>  deviates  generated  from     a
           <u>uniform($low,</u> <u>$high)</u> distribution.    When called in  a scalar context,    generates and returns only
           one   such deviate as a scalar, regardless of the value of <u>$n</u>.

           Argument restrictions: <u>$low</u> must be less than or equal to <u>$high</u>.

           Defaults are  (1, 0, 1).    <b>Note:</b>  <u>$high</u> must   be specified if <u>$low</u> is specified.

       "random_uniform_integer($n, $low, $high)"
           When  called   in  an  array  context,   returns   an array of  <u>$n</u> integer deviates generated from  a
           <u>uniform($low,</u> <u>$high)</u> distribution on the   integers.  When called   in a  scalar  context,  generates
           and returns only one such deviate as a  scalar, regardless of the value of <u>$n</u>.

           Argument   restrictions:  <u>$low</u>  and <u>$high</u>  are  first rounded using int(); the resulting <u>$low</u> must be
           less than or equal to <u>$high</u>, and the resulting  range <u>($high</u> <u>-</u> <u>$low)</u>   must  not   be   greater  than
           2147483561.

           There are no defaults; all three arguments must be provided.

       random_permutation(@array)
           Returns <u>@array</u>, randomly permuted.

       random_permuted_index($n)
           Returns   an  array   of   array  indices, randomly  permuted.  The indices used are (0, ... , $n-1).
           This produces the indices used by "random_permutation" for a given seed, without passing arrays.

           <b>Note:</b> the following are equivalent:

            random_set_seed_from_phrase('jjv');
            random_permutation(@array);

           and

            random_set_seed_from_phrase('jjv');
            @array[(random_permuted_index(scalar(@array)))];

       "random_normal($n, $av, $sd)"
       "random_normal($n, $av)"
       random_normal($n)
       random_normal()
           When called in  an array context, returns  an array  of <u>$n</u>  deviates  generated  from  a  <u>normal($av,</u>
           <u>$sd^2)</u>  distribution.   When  called  in  a  scalar  context,  generates  and returns  only one  such
           deviate as a scalar, regardless of the value of <u>$n</u>.

           Argument restrictions: <u>$sd</u> must be non-negative.

           Defaults are (1, 0, 1).

   <b>Extended</b> <b>Routines</b>
       These routines generate deviates from many other distributions.

       <b>Note:</b> The parameterizations of these deviates are standard (insofar as there <u>is</u> a  standard  ...   )  but
       particular  attention   should  be  paid  to  the distributions of the <u>beta</u>  and <u>gamma</u> deviates (noted in
       "random_beta" and "random_gamma" below).

       "random_beta($n, $aa, $bb)"
           When called in an array  context, returns an   array  of  <u>$n</u>   deviates  generated  from   the   <u>beta</u>
           distribution  with parameters  <u>$aa</u> and <u>$bb</u>.  The density of the beta is:

           X^(<u>$aa</u> - 1) * (1 - X)^(<u>$bb</u> - 1) / B(<u>$aa</u> , <u>$bb</u>) for 0 &lt; X &lt; 1.

           When  called  in   a  scalar  context,  generates   and  returns  only  one such deviate as a scalar,
           regardless of the value of <u>$n</u>.

           Argument restrictions:  Both <u>$aa</u> and <u>$bb</u> must  not  be less than 1.0E-37.

           There are no defaults; all three arguments must be provided.

       "random_binomial($n, $nt, $p)"
           When called  in an array context,  returns an array  of <u>$n</u> outcomes  generated   from  the   <u>binomial</u>
           distribution with  number  of trials <u>$nt</u> and probability of an  event in each  trial <u>$p</u>.  When called
           in  a  scalar  context,  generates  and returns  only one such outcome as a scalar, regardless of the
           value of <u>$n</u>.

           Argument restrictions: <u>$nt</u>  is rounded  using int(); the  result must be non-negative.   <u>$p</u>  must  be
           between 0 and 1 inclusive.

           There are no defaults; both arguments must be provided.

       "random_chi_square($n, $df)"
           When  called  in  an   array context, returns an  array of <u>$n</u>  deviates generated from the <u>chi-square</u>
           distribution with <u>$df</u> degrees  of freedom.  When called in a  scalar context, generates  and  returns
           only one such deviate as a scalar, regardless of the value of <u>$n</u>.

           Argument restrictions: <u>$df</u> must be positive.

           There are no defaults; both arguments must be provided.

       "random_exponential($n, $av)"
       random_exponential($n)
       random_exponential()
           When   called  in  an  array context, returns  an array of <u>$n</u> deviates generated from the <u>exponential</u>
           distribution with mean <u>$av</u>.  When called    in a scalar  context, generates   and  returns  only  one
           such deviate as a scalar, regardless of the value of <u>$n</u>.

           Argument restrictions: <u>$av</u> must be non-negative.

           Defaults are (1, 1).

       "random_f($n, $dfn, $dfd)"
           When  called   in an array  context, returns an  array of <u>$n</u> deviates generated from the <u>F</u>  (variance
           ratio) distribution with degrees of freedom <u>$dfn</u> (numerator) and <u>$dfd</u> (denominator).  When called  in
           a  scalar  context,   generates  and   returns only  one such deviate  as a scalar, regardless of the
           value of <u>$n</u>.

           Argument restrictions: Both <u>$dfn</u> and <u>$dfd</u> must be positive.

           There are no defaults; all three arguments must be provided.

       "random_gamma($n, $a, $r)"
           When called in  an array context, returns  an array  of   <u>$n</u>  deviates  generated  from   the   <u>gamma</u>
           distribution  with  parameters <u>$a</u> and <u>$r</u>.  The density of the gamma is:

           (<u>$a</u>**<u>$r</u>) / Gamma(<u>$r</u>) * X**(<u>$r</u> - 1) * Exp(-<u>$a</u>*X)

           When  called  in   a  scalar  context,  generates  and   returns  only  one such deviate as a scalar,
           regardless of the value of <u>$n</u>.

           Argument restrictions: Both <u>$a</u> and <u>$r</u> must be positive.

           There are no defaults; all three arguments must be provided.

       "random_multinomial($n, @p)"
           When called in an array  context, returns single observation from  the <u>multinomial</u> distribution, with
           <u>$n</u> events classified into as many categories as the length of <u>@p</u>.   The probability of an event being
           classified into category <u>i</u> is given by the <u>i</u>th element of <u>@p</u>.   The  observation  is  an  array  with
           length  equal to <u>@p</u>, so when called in a scalar  context it  returns  the length  of @p.   The sum of
           the elements of the observation is equal to <u>$n</u>.

           Argument  restrictions: <u>$n</u> is  rounded  with int() before it  is used; the   result   must  be   non-
           negative.    <u>@p</u>  must have  length at least 2.  All elements of <u>@p</u> except the  last must be between 0
           and 1  inclusive, and sum to  no  more than   0.99999.  <b>Note:</b> The  last element of <u>@p</u> is a  dummy  to
           indicate  the number of categories, and it is adjusted to bring the sum of the elements of <u>@p</u> to 1.

           There are no defaults; both arguments must be provided.

       "random_multivariate_normal($n, @mean, @covar)"
           When   called  in  an  array  context,  returns  an array of <u>$n</u> deviates (each   deviate  being    an
           array  reference) generated   from   the <u>multivariate</u>  <u>normal</u>  distribution with  mean  vector  <u>@mean</u>
           and  variance-covariance   matrix   <u>@covar</u>.      When  called   in  a  scalar context,  generates and
           returns only  one  such  deviate  as an array reference, regardless of the value of <u>$n</u>.

           Argument restrictions: If the dimension of the deviate to be generated is  <u>p</u>,   <u>@mean</u>   should  be  a
           length  <u>p</u>  array   of  real   numbers.  <u>@covar</u> should be  a length <u>p</u> array of  references to length <u>p</u>
           arrays of real  numbers  (i.e.  a  <u>p</u>  by   <u>p</u>   matrix).    Further,  <u>@covar</u>  should  be  a  symmetric
           positive-definite  matrix,  although  the  <b>Perl</b>  code  does  not check positive-definiteness, and the
           underlying <b>C</b> code    assumes  the  matrix  is   symmetric.    Given  that    the  variance-covariance
           matrix  is   symmetric, it   doesn't matter if   the references  refer   to rows  or columns.   If  a
           non-positive definite matrix is passed  to the function,  it  will abort with the  following message:

            COVM not positive definite in SETGMN

           Also,  a    non-symmetric   <u>@covar</u> may    produce  deviates without complaint,  although they may not
           be  from the expected distribution.  For  these  reasons,  you   are    encouraged   to  <u>verify</u>   <u>the</u>
           <u>arguments</u> <u>passed</u>.

           The  <b>Perl</b> code <u>does</u>   check  the dimensionality of <u>@mean</u>   and <u>@covar</u> for consistency.  It does so by
           checking that the length of the argument  vector  passed is  odd,  that  what  should  be  the   last
           element  of  <u>@mean</u>  and the first element  of <u>@covar</u> look like they are a number followed by an array
           reference respectively, and that the arrays referred to in <u>@covar</u> are as long as <u>@mean</u>.

           There are no defaults; all three arguments must be provided.

       "random_negative_binomial($n, $ne, $p)"
           When  called in an  array context, returns  an array of <u>$n</u>  outcomes  generated  from  the   <u>negative</u>
           <u>binomial</u>  distribution  with  number   of  events <u>$ne</u> and  probability of an event  in each trial <u>$p</u>.
           When called  in  a scalar   context, generates  and  returns only  one  such  outcome  as  a  scalar,
           regardless of the value of <u>$n</u>.

           Argument  restrictions:  <u>$ne</u>  is    rounded  using  int(),  the  result must be positive.  <u>$p</u> must be
           between 0 and 1 exclusive.

           There are no defaults; both arguments must be provided.

       "random_noncentral_chi_square($n, $df, $nonc)"
           When called in  an array context, returns  an array  of <u>$n</u> deviates generated   from  the  <u>noncentral</u>
           <u>chi-square</u>  distribution with <u>$df</u> degrees of freedom and noncentrality  parameter <u>$nonc</u>.  When called
           in a scalar context, generates and returns only  one such deviate as  a  scalar,  regardless  of  the
           value of <u>$n</u>.

           Argument restrictions:   <u>$df</u> must be at  least  1, <u>$nonc</u> must be non-negative.

           There are no defaults; all three arguments must be provided.

       "random_noncentral_f($n, $dfn, $dfd, $nonc)"
           When  called  in  an array context, returns an  array of  <u>$n</u> deviates generated from the <u>noncentral</u> <u>F</u>
           (variance ratio) distribution with degrees of freedom <u>$dfn</u> (numerator)  and <u>$dfd</u>  (denominator);  and
           noncentrality  parameter  <u>$nonc</u>.    When  called in a  scalar context, generates and returns only one
           such deviate as a scalar, regardless of the value of <u>$n</u>.

           Argument restrictions:  <u>$dfn</u> must  be at least   1, <u>$dfd</u> must be positive, and  <u>$nonc</u>  must  be  non-
           negative.

           There are no defaults; all four arguments must be provided.

       "random_poisson($n, $mu)"
           When  called   in  an  array  context,   returns an array  of <u>$n</u> outcomes generated  from the <u>Poisson</u>
           distribution  with mean  <u>$mu</u>.  When called  in a  scalar   context, generates and  returns  only  one
           such outcome as a scalar, regardless of the value of <u>$n</u>.

           Argument restrictions: <u>$mu</u> must be non-negative.

           There are no defaults; both arguments must be provided.

</pre><h4><b>ERROR</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Perl</b> code should "croak" if bad arguments are passed or if the underlying <b>C</b> code  cannot allocate the
       necessary memory.  The only error which should  kill  the  job  without   "croak"ing  is  a  non-positive

       This work  was supported  in part by  grant CA-16672 from the National Cancer Institute.  We are grateful
       to Larry and  Pat McNeil of Corpus Cristi for their generous support.  Some equipment used in this effort
       was provided by IBM as part of a cooperative study agreement; we thank them.

</pre><h4><b>CODE</b> <b>MANIPULATION</b></h4><pre>
       The   <b>C</b>  version of  <b>randlib</b>  was  obtained  by  translating the original    <b>Fortran</b>      <b>randlib</b>   using
       <b>PROMULA.FORTRAN</b>,   and performing some hand crafting of the result.

       Information on <b>PROMULA.FORTRAN</b> can be obtained from:

       <u>wrapper.c</u>   (now   obsolete)    was   created    by  using <b>SWIG</b>,  and performing some modification of the
       result.  <b>SWIG</b> also produced the skeleton of <u>Random.pm</u>.

       The following routines,  which  were  written by  others    and   lightly  modified  for  consistency  in
       packaging, are included in <b>randlib</b>.

       Bottom Level Routines
           These routines are a transliteration of the <b>Pascal</b> in the reference to <b>Fortran</b>, and thence to <b>C</b>.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This POD documents <b>Math::Random</b> version 0.71.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       •   <b>Math::Random</b> (the <b>Perl</b> port  of <b>Randlib</b>) was put  together by John Venier  and Barry  W.  Brown  with
           help from  <b>SWIG</b>.  For  version 0.61, Geoffrey Rommel made various cosmetic changes. Version 0.64 uses
           plain vanilla XS rather than SWIG.

       •   <b>randlib</b> was compiled and written  by  Barry W. Brown, James Lovato, Kathy Russell, and John Venier.
