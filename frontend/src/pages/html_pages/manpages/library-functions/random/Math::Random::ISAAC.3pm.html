</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Math::Random::ISAAC - Perl interface to the ISAAC PRNG algorithm

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.004

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Math::Random::ISAAC;

         my $rng = Math::Random::ISAAC-&gt;new(@seeds);

         for (0..30) {
           print 'Result: ' . $rng-&gt;irand() . "\n";
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       As with other Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) algorithms like the Mersenne Twister (see
       Math::Random::MT), this algorithm is designed to take some seed information and produce seemingly random
       results as output.

       However, ISAAC (Indirection, Shift, Accumulate, Add, and Count) has different goals than these commonly
       used algorithms. In particular, it's really fast - on average, it requires only 18.75 machine cycles to
       generate a 32-bit value.  This makes it suitable for applications where a significant amount of random
       data needs to be produced quickly, such solving using the Monte Carlo method or for games.

       The results are uniformly distributed, unbiased, and unpredictable unless you know the seed. The
       algorithm was published by Bob Jenkins in the late 90s and despite the best efforts of many security
       researchers, no feasible attacks have been found to date.

   <b>USAGE</b> <b>WARNING</b>
       There was no method supplied to provide the initial seed data by the author.  On his web site, Bob
       Jenkins writes:

         Seeding a random number generator is essentially the same problem as
         encrypting the seed with a block cipher.

       In the same spirit, by default, this module does not seed the algorithm at all -- it simply fills the
       state with zeroes -- if no seed is provided.  The idea is to remind users that selecting good seed data
       for their purpose is important, and for the module to conveniently set it to something like "localtime"
       behind-the-scenes hurts users in the long run, since they don't understand the limitations of doing so.

       The type of seed you might want to use depends entirely on the purpose of using this algorithm in your
       program in the first place. Here are some possible seeding methods:

       1 Math::TrulyRandom
           The  Math::TrulyRandom  module  provides  a  way  of  obtaining  truly  random  data  by using timing
           interrupts. This is probably one of the better ways to seed the algorithm.

       2 /dev/random
           Using the system random device is, in principle, the best idea, since it gathers entropy from various
           sources including interrupt timing, other device interrupts,  etc.  However,  it's  not  portable  to
           anything other than Unix-like platforms, and might not produce good data on some systems.

       3 <b>localtime()</b>
           This  works for basic things like simulations, but results in not-so-random output, especially if you
           create new instances quickly (as the seeds would be the same within per-second resolution).

       4 Time::HiRes
           In theory, using Time::HiRes is the same as option (2), but you  get  a  higher  resolution  time  so
           you're  less  likely to have the same seed twice.  Note that you need to transform the output into an
           integer somehow, perhaps by taking the least significant bits or using a hash function. This would be
           less prone to duplicate instances, but it's still not ideal.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         Math::Random::ISAAC-&gt;new( @seeds )

       Creates a "Math::Random::ISAAC" object, based upon either the optimized C/XS version  of  the  algorithm,
       Math::Random::ISAAC::XS, or falls back to the included Pure Perl module, Math::Random::ISAAC::PP.

       Example code:

         my $rng = Math::Random::ISAAC-&gt;new(time);

       This method will return an appropriate <b>Math::Random::ISAAC</b> object or throw an exception on error.

   <b>rand</b>
         $rng-&gt;rand()

       Returns  a  random double-precision floating point number which is normalized between 0 and 1 (inclusive;
       it's a closed interval).

       Internally, this simply takes the uniformly distributed unsigned integer from "$rng-&gt;irand()" and divides
       it by "2**32-1" (maximum unsigned integer size)

       Example code:

         my $next = $rng-&gt;rand();

       This method will return a double-precision floating point number or throw an exception on error.

   <b>irand</b>
         $rng-&gt;irand()

       Returns the next unsigned 32-bit random integer. It will return a value with a value such that: <b>0</b> <b>&lt;=</b> <b>x</b> <b>&lt;=</b>
       <b>2**32-1</b>.

       Example code:

         my $next = $rng-&gt;irand();

       This method will return a 32-bit unsigned integer or throw an exception on error.

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       The intent of this module is to provide single simple interface to the two compatible implementations  of
       this module, namely, Math::Random::ISAAC::XS and Math::Random::ISAAC::PP.

       If,  for  some  reason,  you  need  to determine what version of the module is actually being included by
       "Math::Random::ISAAC", then:

         print 'Backend type: ', $Math::Random::ISAAC::DRIVER, "\n";

       In order to force use of one or the other, simply load the appropriate module:

         use Math::Random::ISAAC::XS;
         my $rng = Math::Random::ISAAC::XS-&gt;new();
         # or
         use Math::Random::ISAAC::PP;
         my $rng = Math::Random::ISAAC::PP-&gt;new();

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       •   Special thanks to Bob Jenkins &lt;<a href="mailto:bob_jenkins@burtleburtle.net">bob_jenkins@burtleburtle.net</a>&gt; for devising this very clever  algorithm
           and releasing it into the public domain.

       •   Thanks  to John L. Allen (contact unknown) for providing a Perl port of the original ISAAC code, upon
           which "Math::Random::ISAAC::PP" is heavily based.  His version is available on Bob's web site, in the
           SEE ALSO section.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Math::Random::ISAAC::XS, the C/XS optimized version of this module, which will be used  automatically  if
       available.

       &lt;<a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaacafa.html">http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaacafa.html</a>&gt;,  Bob  Jenkins'  page  about  ISAAC,  which explains the
       algorithm as well as potential attacks.

       &lt;<a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2006/438.pdf">http://eprint.iacr.org/2006/438.pdf</a>&gt;, a paper entitled "On the  pseudo-random  generator  ISAAC,"  which
       claims  there  are many seeds which will produce non-uniform results. The author, Jean-Philippe Aumasson,
       argues ISAAC should be using rotations (circular shifts) instead of normal shifts to  increase  diffusion
       of the state, among other things.

       &lt;<a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2001/049.pdf">http://eprint.iacr.org/2001/049.pdf</a>&gt;,  a  paper  by Marina Pudovkina discussing plaintext attacks on the
       ISAAC keystream generator. Among other things, it notes that the time complexity is <b>Tmet</b> <b>=</b>  <b>4.67*10^1240</b>,
       so it remains a secure cipher for practical applications.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       •   There is no method that allows re-seeding of algorithms. This is not really necessary because one can
           simply call "new" again with the new seed data periodically.

           But he also provides a simple workaround:

             As ISAAC is intended to be a secure cipher, if you want to reseed it,
             one way is to use some other cipher to seed some initial version of ISAAC,
             then use ISAAC's output as a seed for other instances of ISAAC whenever
             they need to be reseeded.

       •   There is no way to clone a PRNG instance. I'm not sure why this is might even be necessary or useful.
           File a bug report with an explanation why and I'll consider adding it to the next release.
