       Running::Commentary - call "system" cleanly, with tracking messages

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Running::Commentary version 0.000005

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Running::Commentary;

           # Set a lexically scoped flag for all subsequent calls...
           # (No announcements, if this flag set)
           run_with -nomessage if !$verbose;

           # Act like system(), only louder and cleaner...
           run 'Resetting' =&gt; "rm -rf '$ROOT_DIR'"
               or die "Couldn't reset";

           # Act like system(), but croak() if the command fails...
           run -critical, 'Building Makefile' =&gt; 'perl Makefile.PL';

           # Calls to run() may be nested, to allow subtasks to be tracked...
           run 'Running tests'
               =&gt; sub {
                   for my $file (@profiled_files) {
                       push @profiles, "$NAMING_ROOT/$file.out";
                       local $ENV{NYTPROF} = "file=$profiles[-1]";

                       run -nooutput, "Testing $file"
                           =&gt; "perl -d:NYTProf $profiled_path/$file &gt;&amp; /dev/null";
                   }
           };

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a single subroutine: "run()" which is designed to be a more informative and less
       error-prone replacement for the built-in "system()".

       It also provides a compile-time keyword: "run_with" with which you can set lexically scoped default
       options for "run()".

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       "run $MESSAGE =&gt; $SYSTEM_CMD;"
           This acts like "system $SYSTEM_CMD", except that it returns true on success and false on failure, and
           it announces what it's doing. For example:

               run 'Resetting directories' =&gt; "rm -rf @STD_DIRS"

           ...would first output:

               Resetting directories...

           ...then execute the system command, and finish the message:

               Resetting directories...done

           If the command failed for some reason, the completion would reflect the problem:

               Resetting directories...
               rm: tets: No such file or directory
               Resetting directories...exited with value 1

           Or:

               Resetting directories...failed to execute: No such file or directory

       "run $MESSAGE =&gt; sub {...};"
           This  form  of  the  command  expects  a  subroutine  reference,  rather than a string, as its second
           argument. Once again it prints the tracking message, then executes the subroutine,  then  prints  the
           outcome.

           The  subroutine  is  run  inside  an  "eval"  block, so any exceptions it throws are intercepted, and
           reported as the outcome at the end of the tracking message. To have exceptions inside the  subroutine
           propagate back out of the call to "run()", use the "-critical" option (see below).

           For example:

               run 'Printing your data' =&gt; sub {
                   for my $datum (@data) {
                       say "    $datum-&gt;{key}: $datum-&gt;{value}";
                   }
               }

           Would output:

               Printing your data...
                   Name: Fred
                   Age: 28
                   Score: 87
               Printing your data...done

           You can also nest calls to "run()" using this form.  For example:

               run 'Running your request' =&gt; sub {
                   for my $cmd (split /\n/, $request) {
                       run "Running '$cmd'" =&gt; $cmd;
                   }
               }

           Would produce:

               Running your request...
                   Running 'rm source'...done
                   Running 'rebuild_files'...done
                   Running 'make test'.......done
               Running your request...done

       "run $SYSTEM_CMD;"
       "run sub {...};"
           When  called  without  a  message,  "run()"  simply executes the system command or subroutine without
           printing any kind of progress message.  In  other  words,  it  merely  acts  as  a  (quietly)  better
           "system()".

       "run_with @OPTIONS;"
           The "run_with" keyword can be called with any of the options available to "run()" (see "OPTIONS"). It
           takes  the  options  given to it and makes them the default arguments to "run()" for the remainder of
           the current lexical scope.

           For example, to cause any subsequent failed command to throw an exception...

               {
                   run_with -critical;

                   run "loading"     =&gt; $LOAD_CMD;
                   run "checking"    =&gt; $CHECK_CMD;
                   run "installing"  =&gt; $INSTALL_CMD;
                   run "cleaning up" =&gt; $CLEANUP_CMD;
               }

           ...or to silence message printing on request:

               {
                   run_with -nomessage if $opt{-quiet};

                   run "loading"     =&gt; $LOAD_CMD;
                   run "checking"    =&gt; $CHECK_CMD;
                   run "installing"  =&gt; $INSTALL_CMD;
                   run "cleaning up" =&gt; $CLEANUP_CMD;
               }

       Note that "run_with" is a compile-time keyword, not a subroutine, so  it  should  only  be  called  as  a
       statement (i.e. in void context).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options can be included anywhere in the argument list of a call to "run()" or "run_with".

       "-nomessage"
           Run  the  command  without  printing  the  tracking  message.  Normally used as a conditional lexical
           option:

               run_with -nomessage if $opt{quiet};

           The output of the actual system command is still printed (unless "-nooutput"  or  "-silent"  is  also
           specified)

       "-showmessage"
           Run  the  command,  printing  the tracking message.  Useful to turn message printing back on inside a
           scope where "-nomessage" is already in effect.

       "-nooutput"
           Run the command without echoing any of its output.  The tracking message  is  still  printed  (unless
           "-nomessage" or "-silent" is also specified)

       "-showoutput"
           Run  the  command,  echoing  any output.  Useful to turn command echoing back on inside a scope where
           "-nooutput" is already in effect.

       "-silent"
           Identical to: "-nomessage, -nooutput"

       "-showall"
           Identical to: "-showmessage, -showoutput".  Useful to override "-silent" in a nested scope.

       "-critical"
           Normally, if a call to "run()" fails, it simply returns "undef".  However, if the "-critical"  option
           is specified, any call to "run" that fails will immediately throw an exception.

       "-nocritical"
           Revert "run()" to returning "undef" on failure.  Useful to override "-critical" in a nested scope.

       "-dry"
           Instead  of  executing  the  specified system command, just print it out.  Useful for dry runs during
           development and testing.

       "-colour =&gt; \%COLOUR_SPEC"
           Specify the colours to be used for messages and output. Colours are specified as the  values  of  the
           hash, with the keys indicating what purpose each colour is to be used for. For example:

               run_with -colour =&gt; {
                   MESSAGE =&gt; 'white',          # Colour for tracking messages
                   DONE    =&gt; 'bold cyan',      # Colour for success messages
                   FAILED  =&gt; 'yellow on_red',  # Colour for failure messages
                   OUTPUT  =&gt; 'clear'           # Colour for command output
               };

           The  colour  specifications  must be single strings, which are split on whitespace and then passed to
           the "Term::ANSIColor" module. If that module is not available, this option is silently ignored.

           This option may also be spelled "-color".

       "-nocolour"
           Print all messages and output without any special colours.

           This option may also be spelled "-nocolor".

</pre><h4><b>ERROR</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       On failure "run()" normally either returns "undef" or throws an exception (if "-critical" is specified).

       However, "Running::Commentary" incorporates the "Lexical::Failure" module, so you can also request  other
       failure responses for any particular scope, by passing a named argument when loading the module:

           # Report errors by confess()-ing...
           use Running::Commentary  fail =&gt; 'confess';

           # Report errors by returning a failure object...
           use Running::Commentary  fail =&gt; 'failobj';

           # Report errors by setting a flag variable...
           use Running::Commentary  fail =&gt; \$error;

           # Report errors by calling a subroutine...
           use Running::Commentary  fail =&gt; \&amp;error_handler;

       For details of the available options, see the documentation of "Lexical::Failure".

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       "Bad argument to 'use Running::Commentary'"
           The module accepts only one named argument:

               use Running::Commentary  'fail' =&gt; $fail_mode;

           (see "ERROR HANDLING").

           You apparently passed it something else.  Or perhaps misspelt 'fail'?

       "Useless call to run() with no command"
           "run()"  expects  at  least one argument (apart from any configuration options); namely, something to
           execute.  That can be either a string containing a system command, or else a subroutine reference.

           You didn't give it either of those, so the call to "run()" was superfluous.

           Or, possibly, you wanted "run_with" instead.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Running::Commentary requires no configuration files or environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       This module requires Perl v5.14 or later.

       It also requires the modules: "Lexical::Failure", and "Keyword::Simple".

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       No bugs have been reported.
