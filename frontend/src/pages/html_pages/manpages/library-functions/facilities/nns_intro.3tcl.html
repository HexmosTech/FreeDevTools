</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nns_intro - Name service facility, introduction

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>nns</u>  (short  for <u>nano</u> <u>nameservice</u>) is a facility built for the package <b>comm</b>, adding a simple name service
       to it.  It is also built on top of <b>comm</b>, using it for the exchange of messages  between  the  client  and
       server parts.

       This  name  service facility has nothing to do with the Internet's <u>Domain</u> <u>Name</u> <u>System</u>, otherwise known as
       <u>DNS</u>. If the reader is looking for a package dealing with that please see either of the packages  <b>dns</b>  and
       <b>resolv</b>, both found in Tcllib too.

       Tcllib  provides  2  applications  and  4  packages  which are working together and provide access to the
       facility at different levels.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The application <b>nnsd</b> provides a simple name server which can be run by anybody anywhere on their  system,
       as they see fit.  It is also an example on the use of the server-side package <b>nameserv::server</b>.

       Complementing  this  server is the <b>nns</b> client application.  A possible, but no very sensible use would be
       to enter name/port bindings into a server from a shell script. Not sensible, as shell scripts normally do
       not provide a <b>comm</b>-based service.

       The only case for this to make some sense would be in a shell script wrapped  around  a  Tcl  script  FOO
       which  is  using comm, to register the listening port used by FOO.  However even there it would much more
       sensible to extend FOO to use the nameservice directly. And in regard on how to that <b>nns</b> can be  used  as
       both  example  and template.  Beyond that it may also be useful to perform nameservice queries from shell
       scripts.

       The third application, <b>nnslog</b> is a stripped down form of the <b>nns</b> client application.  It  is  reduced  to
       perform a continuous search for all changes and logs all received events to stdout.

       Both  clients  use  the  <b>nameserv::auto</b>  package  to  automatically hande the loss and restoration of the
       connection to the server.

</pre><h4><b>PACKAGES</b></h4><pre>
       The two main packages implementing the service are <b>nameserv</b> and <b>nameserv::server</b>, i.e. client and server.
       The latter has not much of an API, just enough to start, stop, and configure it. See the application <b>nnsd</b>
       on how to use it.

       The basic client, in package <b>nameserv</b>, provides the main API to manipulate  and  query  the  service.  An
       example of its use is the application <b>nns</b>.

       The  second  client  package,  <b>nameserv::auto</b>  is  API  compatible  to the basic client, but provides the
       additional functionality that it will automatically restore data like bound names when the connection  to
       the  name  service  was lost and then reestablished. I.e. it automatically detects the loss of the server
       and re-enters the data when the server comes back.

       The package <b>nameserv::common</b> is of no interest to users. It is an internal package  containing  code  and
       definitions common to the packages <b>nameserv</b> and <b>nameserv::server</b>.

       All  packages  use  the <b>uevent</b> package for the reporting of special circumstances via events, and reserve
       the uevent-tag <u>nameserv</u> for their exclusive use. All their events will be posted to that tag.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNALS</b></h4><pre>
       The document <u>Name</u> <u>service</u> <u>facility,</u> <u>client/server</u> <u>protocol</u> specifies the protocol used  by  the  packages
       <b>nameserv</b> and <b>nameserv::server</b> to talk to each other. It is of no interest to users of either the packages
       or applications.

       Developers  wishing  to  modify  and/or  extend  or  to  just understand the internals of the nameservice
       facility however are strongly advised to read it.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS,</b> <b>IDEAS,</b> <b>FEEDBACK</b></h4><pre>
       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain bugs and  other  problems.   Please
       report  such  in  the  category  <u>nameserv</u>  of the <u>Tcllib</u> <u>Trackers</u> [<a href="http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist">http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist</a>].
       Please also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or documentation.

       When proposing code changes, please provide <u>unified</u> <u>diffs</u>, i.e the output of <b>diff</b> <b>-u</b>.

       Note further that <u>attachments</u> are strongly preferred over inlined patches. Attachments  can  be  made  by
       going  to the <b>Edit</b> form of the ticket immediately after its creation, and then using the left-most button
       in the secondary navigation bar.
