</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::NotAcceptable - 406 Not Acceptable

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.028

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The resource identified by the request is only capable of generating response entities which have content
       characteristics not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the request.

       Unless it was a HEAD request, the response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of available entity
       characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate.
       The entity format is specified by the media type given in the Content-Type header field. Depending upon
       the format and the capabilities of the user agent, selection of the most appropriate choice MAY be
       performed automatically. However, this specification does not define any standard for such automatic
       selection.

         Note: HTTP/1.1 servers are allowed to return responses which are
         not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the
         request. In some cases, this may even be preferable to sending a
         406 response. User agents are encouraged to inspect the headers of
         an incoming response to determine if it is acceptable.

       If the response could be unacceptable, a user agent SHOULD temporarily stop receipt of more data and
       query the user for a decision on further actions.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
