</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       Constructor for the object-oriented interface to this module. Arguments may be specified in a hash or a
       hashref.

       Args:

       root
           Required.  JSONPath  expressions  will  be  evaluated  with  respect to this. Must be a hashref or an
           arrayref.

       expression
           JSONPath expression to evaluate

       want_ref
           Set this to true if you want a reference to the thing the JSONPath expression  matches,  rather  than
           the value of said thing. Useful if you want to use this to modify hashrefs / arrayrefs in place.

       script_engine
           Defaults to "PseudoJS", which is my clever name for a subset of Javascript-<b>like</b> operators for Boolean
           expressions.   See  "Filtering  with  PseudoJS".  You may also specify "perl" here, in which case the
           filter will be treated as Perl code.  See "Filtering with Perl".

   <b>evaluate_jsonpath</b>
       Evaluate a JSONPath expression on the given object. CLASS METHOD.

       Args:

       $json_object
           JSON object for which the expression will be evaluated. If this is a scalar, it will be treated as  a
           JSON string and parsed into the appropriate Perl data structure first.

       $expression
           JSONPath expression to evaluate on the object.

       %args
           Misc.  arguments  to  this  method. Currently the only supported argument is 'want_ref' - set this to
           true in order to return a reference to the matched portion of the object, rather than  the  value  of
           that matched portion.

   <b>evaluate</b>
       Evaluate a JSONPath expression on the object passed to the constructor.  OBJECT METHOD.

       Args:

       $expression
           JSONPath expression to evaluate on the object.

       %args
           Misc. arguments to this method.

           Supported keys:

           want_ref
               Set this to true in order to return a reference to the matched portion of the object, rather than
               the value of the matched portion.

           want_path
               Set  this  to  true  in  order  to  return  the  canonical  path(s)  to the elements matching the
               expression.

</pre><h4><b>JSONPath</b></h4><pre>
       This     code     implements     the     JSONPath     specification     at     JSONPath     specification
       &lt;<a href="http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/">http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/</a>&gt;.

       JSONPath is a tool, similar to XPath for XML, that allows one to construct queries to pick out parts of a
       JSON structure.

   <b>JSONPath</b> <b>Expressions</b>
       From the spec: "JSONPath expressions always refer to a JSON structure in the same way as XPath expression
       are  used  in  combination  with an XML document. Since a JSON structure is usually anonymous and doesn't
       necessarily have a "root member object" JSONPath assumes the abstract name $ assigned to the outer  level
       object."

       Note  that  in  JSONPath  square  brackets  operate on the object or array addressed by the previous path
       fragment. Indices always start by 0.

   <b>Operators</b>
       $   the root object/element

       @   the current object/element

       . or []
           child operator

       ..  recursive descent. JSONPath borrows this syntax from E4X.

       *   wildcard. All objects/elements regardless their names.

       []  subscript operator. XPath uses it  to  iterate  over  element  collections  and  for  predicates.  In
           Javascript and JSON it is the native array operator.

       [,] Union  operator  in  XPath  results in a combination of node sets. JSONPath allows alternate names or
           array indices as a set.

       [start:end:step]
           array slice operator borrowed from ES4.

       ?() applies a filter (script) expression. See Filtering.

       ()  script expression, using the underlying script engine. Handled the same as "?()".

   <b>Filtering</b>
       Filters are the most powerful feature of JSONPath. They allow the caller to retrieve data  conditionally,
       similar to Perl's "grep" operator.

       Filters  are  specified  using the '?(' token, terminated by ')'. Anything in between these two tokens is
       treated as a filter expression. Filter expressions must return a boolean value.

       <u>Filtering</u> <u>with</u> <u>PseudoJS</u>

       By default, this module uses a limited subset of Javascript expressions to evaluate filters.  Using  this
       script engine, specify the filter in the form "&lt;LHS&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;RHS&gt;", or "&lt;LHS&gt;". This latter case will
       be evaluated as "&lt;LHS&gt; is true".

       &lt;LHS&gt;  must  be  a  valid  JSONPath  expression. &lt;RHS&gt; must be a scalar value; comparison of two JSONPath
       expressions is not supported at this time.

       Example:

       Using the JSON in SYNOPSIS above and the JSONPath expression "$..book[?(@.category ==  "fiction")]",  the
       filter expression "@.category == "fiction"" will match all values having a value of "fiction" for the key
       "category".

       Regular  expressions  are  supported  using  the  "=~"  operator,  for  example: "$..book[?(@.category =~
       /Fiction/i)]".      This      is      an      extension      of      the      Goessner      specification
       &lt;<a href="http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/">http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/</a>&gt;   introduced   by   Jayway   JsonPath  &lt;https://github.com/json-
       path/JsonPath&gt;. Other Jayway operators are not currently supported.

   <b>Filtering</b> <b>with</b> <b>Perl</b>
       When the script engine is set to "perl", filter Using  the  JSON  in  SYNOPSIS  above  and  the  JSONPath
       expression "$..book[?(@.category == "fiction")]",

       This  is  understandably  dangerous. Although steps have been taken (Perl expressions are evaluated using
       Safe and a limited set of permitted opcodes) to reduce the risk, callers should be aware of the risk when
       using filters.

       When filtering in Perl, there are some differences between the JSONPath spec and this implementation.

       •   JSONPath uses the token '$' to refer to the root node. As this is not  valid  Perl,  this  should  be
           replaced with '$root' in a filter expression.

       •   JSONPath  uses  the  token  '@'  to  refer to the current node. This is also not valid Perl. Use '$_'
           instead.
