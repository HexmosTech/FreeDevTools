       Lingua::Sentence - Perl extension for breaking text paragraphs into sentences

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use Lingua::Sentence;

               my $splitter = Lingua::Sentence-&gt;new("en");

               my $text = 'This is a paragraph. It contains several sentences. "But why," you ask?';

               print $splitter-&gt;split($text);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module allows splitting of text paragraphs into sentences. It is based on scripts developed by
       Philipp Koehn and Josh Schroeder for processing the Europarl corpus (&lt;<a href="http://www.statmt.org/europarl/">http://www.statmt.org/europarl/</a>&gt;).

       The module uses punctuation and capitalization clues to split paragraphs into an newline-separated string
       with one sentence per line. For example:

               This is a paragraph. It contains several sentences. "But why," you ask?

       goes to:

               This is a paragraph.
               It contains several sentences.
               "But why," you ask?

       Languages currently supported by the module are:

       Catalan
       Czech
       Dutch
       English
       French
       German
       Greek
       Hungarian
       Icelandic
       Italian
       Latvian
       Polish
       Portuguese
       Russian
       Spanish
       Slovak
       Slovenian
       Swedish

   <b>Nonbreaking</b> <b>Prefixes</b> <b>Files</b>
       Nonbreaking  prefixes are loosely defined as any word ending in a period that does NOT indicate an end of
       sentence marker. A basic example is Mr. and Ms. in English.

       The sentence splitter module uses the nonbreaking prefix files included in this distribution.

       To add a file for other languages, follow the naming convention nonbreaking_prefix.?? and  use  the  two-
       letter language code you intend to use when creating a Lingua::Sentence object.

       The  sentence splitter module will first look for a file for the language it is processing, and fall back
       to English if a file for that language is not found.

       For the splitter, normally a period followed by an uppercase word results in a  sentence  split.  If  the
       word preceeding the period is a nonbreaking prefix, this line break is not inserted.

       A  special  case  of  prefixes,  NUMERIC_ONLY,  is  included for special cases where the prefix should be
       handled ONLY when before numbers.  For example, "Article No. 24 states this." the No.  is  a  nonbreaking
       prefix. However, in "No. It is not true." No functions as a word.

       See the example prefix files included in the distribution for more examples.

       <u>CREDITS</u>

       Thanks  for the following individuals for supplying nonbreaking prefix files: Bas Rozema (Dutch), Hilário
       Leal Fontes (Portuguese), Jesús Giménez (Catalan &amp; Spanish), Anne-Kathrin Schumann (Russian)

   <b>EXPORT</b>
       new($lang_id)
           Instantiate an object to split sentences in language $lang_id. If the language is  not  supported,  a
           splitter object for English will be instantiated.

       new($lang_id,$nonbreaking_prefix_file)
           Instantiate  an  object  to  split  sentences  in  language  $lang_id and the nonbreaking prefix file
           $nonbreaking_prefix_file. If the file  does  not  exist,  a  splitter  object  for  English  will  be
           instantiated.

       split($text)
           Split sentences in $text by inserting newline characters at the sentence breaks. The resulting string
           is also terminated with a newline.

       split_array($text)
           Split sentences in $text into an array of sentences.
