</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       irsim-analyzer - A graphical interface to irsim

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>analyzer</b> <u>node...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  analyzer  provides  a  graphical  interface to irsim; displaying the state of the nodes (or vectors)
       <u>node...</u>

       Every invocation of the <b>analyzer</b> command adds a new set of signals to the display list.

       The view is split into 3 regions: a trace window, a text window, and a banner.  The banner  displays  the
       name  of the simulation (from the sim file), and the <u>pull-down</u> menu headers.  The text window is a 1-line
       window used to request and display certain information.

       The trace window displays the following information:

       <b>left</b> <b>side:</b>   names of the signals (nodes/vectors) displayed.

       <b>top</b> <b>side:</b>    On the left and right sides, the time corresponding to the left and right edges of the trace
                    window.  In the center, the time of the current <u>cursor</u> position.

       <b>right</b> <b>side:</b>  Values of the signals under the cursor.

</pre><h4><b>MENU</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>zoom:</b>
                     <b>in</b>   Zooms in by a factor of 2 (magnify).

                     <b>out</b>  Zooms out by a factor of 2 (reduce).

       <b>base:</b>  Changes the numerical base used to display the value of the selected  vector  (see  below  how  to
              select a trace) to one of the following:

              <b>bin</b>  (base 2)

              <b>oct</b>  (base 8)

              <b>hex</b>  (base 16)

       <b>window:1</b>

              <b>delta</b> <b>T</b>     Allows  one to determine the difference (in time) between any two edges.   First click
                          the mouse (any button) to the right of the first edge, then to the left of the  second
                          edge.  The time of the two edges as well as their difference will be shown in the text
                          window.   As  long  as  the  button remains depressed, a line is shown between the two
                          edges.  Times are all shown in ns.

              <b>move</b> <b>to</b>     Moves the left edge of the trace window to the specified time.  The time is  requested
                          in the text window.

              <b>set</b> <b>width</b>   Sets  the  number  of  ns.  that will be displayed.  The time is requested in the text
                          window.

              <b>name</b> <b>length</b> Since the most important differentiating information in a long signal name is  usually
                          at  the  end, the analyzer will display the last 15 characters of a signal name.  This
                          option allows changing the maximum number of characters that will be displayed,  which
                          must be in the range [8-256].

              <b>scroll</b>      Usually the analyzer displays simulation activity by scrolling the traces to the left,
                          so  the  last  changes  are shown. The <u>scroll</u> feature enables/disables this scrolling,
                          effectively freezing the traces.  When scrolling is enabled, a check mark is shown  on
                          this menu entry.

       <b>print:</b>  These  options  control  the generation of a PostScript file suitable for obtaining a hardcopy of
               the trace window.

               <b>file</b>    Requests the filename to hold the PostScript  output.   Hitting  <u>&lt;return&gt;</u>  will  use  the
                       default name (shown in parens).  Hitting <u>&lt;ctrl-C&gt;</u> will abort generation of the file.  The
                       following  menu  entries  control  the aspect of the PostScript file; a check mark in the
                       corresponding menu entry implies that the feature will be included in the output.

               <b>banner</b>  Generate a banner, showing the simulation name and current date.

               <b>legend</b>  Generate (in a separate page) a description of the signals displayed: the <u>complete</u>  names
                       of  nodes  (since the first characters may be stripped), and for vectors the names of the
                       nodes of which it is composed.

               <b>times</b>   Generate a time ruler at the bottom of the traces.

               <b>outline</b> Draw an outline around the trace window.

</pre><h4><b>MOUSE</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The analyzer provides various functions depending on where in the window a  mouse  button  is  depressed.
       All buttons have the same meaning, except inside the scrollbar.  Pressing a mouse button in the following
       regions will provide:

       <b>Signal</b> <b>names:</b>
              The  signal  name  where  the  button  was  depressed will be highlighted and will be moved to the
              position where the button is released, scrolling the other traces if necessary.  If the button  is
              released  under  the  same  signal on which it was pressed, that signal will become <u>selected.</u>  The
              selected signal is always underlined, and some information regarding that signal is printed in the
              text window.

              If the button is released outside the traces area (above or below) the signal will be removed from
              the display.  It can only be added again by invoking the <b>analyzer</b> command.

       <b>Left</b> <b>Arrow:</b>
              The traces are scrolled left by half a <u>page</u> (move back in time).

       <b>Right</b> <b>Arrow:</b>
              The traces are scrolled right by half a <u>page</u> (move forward in time).

       <b>Double</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Arrow:</b>
              Scrolls traces left by a full <u>page.</u>

       <b>Double</b> <b>Right</b> <b>Arrow:</b>
              Scrolls traces right by a full <u>page.</u>

       <b>Scrollbar:</b>
              The <b>left</b> <b>button</b> allows one to <u>stretch</u> the left side of the window, thereby zooming  in/out  by  an
              arbitrary amount.  The right side of the window remains the same.

              The  <b>right</b> <b>button</b> allows one to <u>stretch</u> the right side of the window, thereby zooming in/out by an
              arbitrary amount.  The left side of the window remains the same.

              The <b>middle</b> <b>button</b> moves the whole view back and forth in time.  The magnification  factor  remains
              the same.

       <b>Traces</b>
              The  <u>cursor</u>  is  moved  to  the  time-step  where  the mouse is clicked.  Some lack of accuracy in
              selecting the time may become apparent due to screen resolution round off.

              Holding down the <u>shift</u> key simultaneously with the mouse button will  <b>not</b>  move  the  <u>cursor,</u>  but
              rather  show  the  value  of the signal at the time-step where the mouse is clicked.  The value is
              printed in the text window using the following format:

                 <u>name</u> <b>@</b>  <u>time:</u><b>value=</b><u>value</u><b>,input=</b><u>status</u>

              The <u>value</u> is always shown in binary, regardless of the base selected for that signal.  The  <u>status</u>
              is  a  string  showing which nodes where inputs at that time.  Nodes that were inputs have an <b>i</b> in
              their respective position, otherwise an <b>-.</b>

       <b>Cursor</b> <b>Values:</b>
              The selected signal value is highlighted and, when the button is released, the value of the signal
              is <u>expanded</u> in the text window.  This is useful for displaying each of the bits  that  make  up  a
              vector.  The information printed has the following format:

                    <u>name</u><b>:value=</b><u>value</u> <b>input=</b><u>status</u>

              <b>where</b> <u>value</u> and <u>status</u> have the same meaning as above.

       <b>Banner:</b>
              Clicking on the banner brings the window to the foreground.

       <b>Box</b> <b>on</b> <b>Banner:</b>
              Clicking  in  the  <u>little</u> box on the left side of the banner iconizes the analyzer window.  To de-
              iconize the window, simply click any button within the icon.

       <b>Banner</b> <b>Menus:</b>
              Pressing a mouse button in one of the banner  menus  (on  the  right  side)  will  pull  down  the
              corresponding menu.

</pre><h4><b>X</b> <b>DEFAULTS</b></h4><pre>
       The  analyzer  application  uses  the appropriate resource specification at startup time to customize the
       appearance of its window.  The format for a resource specification in the .Xdefaults file is:

                   [name.]resource:  value

       For the analyzer, the available names are <b>irsim</b> and <b>analyzer.</b>  The available resources are:

       <b>background</b>     Specifies the traces window background color. The default is black.

       <b>foreground</b>     Specifies the text color, or the background of everything else besides the traces  window.
                      The default is white.

       <b>geometry</b>       Specifies  the  default  geometry (window size and screen location) of the graphic window.
                      The default Xgeometry is "=1000x300+0+0".

       <b>reverseVideo</b>   Specifies whether the foreground and background colors are to be reversed  (on  monochrome
                      displays only).  The default is off.

       <b>font</b>           Specifies the fixed-width font displayed.  The default is 6x13.

       <b>borderWidth</b>    Specifies the width of the border (in pixels).  The default is 2.

       <b>borderColor</b>    Specifies the border color when the window is selected.  The default is black.

       <b>highlight</b>      Specifies the color used for highlighting.  The default is red (color displays only).

       <b>traceColor</b>     Specifies the color in which the traces are drawn.  The default is white.

       <b>bannerBg</b>       Specifies the background color for the banner.  The default is white.

       <b>bannerFg</b>       Specifies the foreground (text) color for the banner.  The default is black.
