</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Debian::Javahelper::Eclipse - Eclipse Helper Library.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Debian::Javahelper::Eclipse;

        my @orbitdeps = ();
        push(@orbitdeps, {
            EOB_SYM_NAME =&gt; 'org.apache.commons.net',
            EOB_SYS_JAR  =&gt; '/usr/share/java/commons-net2.jar'});
        #...
        # Install the feature to "$dropins/$name"
        install_zipped_feature($zip, "$dropins/$name");
        #  and symlink the following orbitdeps.
        install_zipped_feature($zip, "$dropins/$name", @orbitdeps);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is used by the eclipse related javahelpers to share common code.

       Please note this API is not stable and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed at the current time.
       Please contact the maintainers if you are interested in a stable API.

   <b>Definitions</b>
       A bundle refers to a jar file. An orbit dependency (a.k.a orbitdep) is a bundle, which is used by eclipse
       or one of its features without being a part of eclipse or said feature.

       This module keeps track of bundles via hashes; see the EOB_* constants for relevant keys (and their
       expected values).

   <b>Constants</b>
       EOB_SYM_NAME
           Key for hashes to fetch the symbolic name of a bundle.

       EOB_BUNDLE_VERSION
           Key for hashes to fetch the version of a bundle.

       EOB_SYS_JAR
           Key for hashes to fetch the path to the system installed jar file.

           Only valid for an orbit dependency and cannot be used with manifests.

   <b>Methods</b>
       install_zipped_feature($fzip, $loc[, $orbitdeps[, $package, $needs]])
           Unpacks  the  zipped  feature  $fzip into $loc, which should be a subfolder of a dropins folder (e.g.
           /usr/share/eclipse/dropins/emf). This can  also  be  used  to  install  the  feature  into  a  "build
           environment".  In this case it should be installed into the same folder as the SDK is (this folder is
           usually called "SDK").

           If $orbitdeps is present, it should be an ARRAY ref containing  orbit  dependencies,  which  will  be
           symlinked  after unpacking. This sub only needs the EOB_SYM_NAME and EOB_SYS_JAR to be set and valid.
           Orbit dependencies not present in the installed folder will  be  ignored,  so  it  is  safe  to  have
           unrelated orbit dependencies in the ARRAY ref.

           If  $package and $needs are present, the former should be the name of a debian package and the latter
           a hashref. The sub will populate the $needs hashref with which orbit dependencies  are  used  by  the
           package.  The $needs hashref can be re-used in multiple calls to this sub.

           Keys  in  $needs  will be the path to the orbit jar's real location (EOB_SYS_JAR) and the value a new
           hashref. This hashref has as keys the names of packages and as  values  1.  The  $needs  is  used  by
           jh_installeclipse to populate the ${orbit:Depends} variables for packages.
