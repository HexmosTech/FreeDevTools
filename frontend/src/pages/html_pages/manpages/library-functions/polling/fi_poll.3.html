</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>fi_poll_open</b> <b>(deprecated)</b>
       fi_poll_open creates a new polling set.  A poll set enables an optimized method for progressing asynchro‐
       nous operations across multiple completion queues and counters and checking for their completions.

       A poll set is defined with the following attributes.

              struct fi_poll_attr {
                  uint64_t             flags;     /* operation flags */
              };

       <u>flags</u>  Flags  that set the default operation of the poll set.  The use of this field is reserved and must
              be set to 0 by the caller.

   <b>fi_close</b> <b>(deprecated)</b>
       The fi_close call releases all resources associated with a poll set.  The poll set must not be associated
       with any other resources prior to being closed, otherwise the call will return -FI_EBUSY.

   <b>fi_poll_add</b> <b>(deprecated)</b>
       Associates a completion queue or counter with a poll set.

   <b>fi_poll_del</b> <b>(deprecated)</b>
       Removes a completion queue or counter from a poll set.

   <b>fi_poll</b> <b>(deprecated)</b>
       Progresses all completion queues and counters associated with a poll  set  and  checks  for  events.   If
       events  might have occurred, contexts associated with the completion queues and/or counters are returned.
       Completion queues will return their context if they are not empty.  The context associated with a counter
       will be returned if the counter’s success value or error value have changed since the last time  fi_poll,
       fi_cntr_set,  or  fi_cntr_add  were called.  The number of contexts is limited to the size of the context
       array, indicated by the count parameter.

       Note that fi_poll only indicates that events might be available.  In some cases,  providers  may  consume
       such events internally, to drive progress, for example.  This can result in fi_poll returning false posi‐
       tives.  Applications should drive their progress based on the results of reading events from a completion
       queue or reading counter values.  The fi_poll function will always return all completion queues and coun‐
       ters that do have new events.

   <b>fi_wait_open</b> <b>(deprecated)</b>
       fi_wait_open  allocates  a  new  wait  set.  A wait set enables an optimized method of waiting for events
       across multiple completion queues and counters.  Where possible, a wait set uses a single underlying wait
       object that is signaled when a specified condition occurs on an associated completion queue or counter.

       The properties and behavior of a wait set are defined by struct fi_wait_attr.

              struct fi_wait_attr {
                  enum fi_wait_obj     wait_obj;  /* requested wait object */
                  uint64_t             flags;     /* operation flags */
              };

       <u>wait_obj</u>
              Wait sets are associated with specific wait object(s).  Wait objects allow applications  to  block
              until  the wait object is signaled, indicating that an event is available to be read.  The follow‐
              ing values may be used to specify the type of wait object associated with a wait set:  FI_WAIT_UN‐
              SPEC, FI_WAIT_FD, FI_WAIT_MUTEX_COND (deprecated), and FI_WAIT_YIELD.

       - <u>FI_WAIT_UNSPEC</u>
              Specifies  that  the  user  will  only  wait on the wait set using fabric interface calls, such as
              fi_wait.  In this case, the underlying provider may select the most appropriate  or  highest  per‐
              forming  wait  object  available,  including  custom  wait  mechanisms.   Applications that select
              FI_WAIT_UNSPEC are not guaranteed to retrieve the underlying wait object.

       - <u>FI_WAIT_FD</u>
              Indicates that the wait set should use a single file descriptor as its wait mechanism, as  exposed
              to  the application.  Internally, this may require the use of epoll in order to support waiting on
              a single file descriptor.  File descriptor wait objects must be usable in the POSIX <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a>(2)  and
              <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</a>(2), and Linux <a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll</a>(7) routines (if available).  Provider signal an FD wait object by marking
              it as readable or with an error.

       - <u>FI_WAIT_MUTEX_COND</u> (deprecated)
              Specifies that the wait set should use a pthread mutex and cond variable as a wait object.

       - <u>FI_WAIT_POLLFD</u>
              This  option is similar to FI_WAIT_FD, but allows the wait mechanism to use multiple file descrip‐
              tors as its wait mechanism, as viewed by the application.  The use of FI_WAIT_POLLFD can eliminate
              the need to use epoll to abstract away needing to check multiple file descriptors when waiting for
              events.  The file descriptors must be usable in the POSIX  <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a>(2)  and  <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</a>(2)  routines,  and
              match directly to being used with poll.  See the NOTES section below for details on using pollfd.

       - <u>FI_WAIT_YIELD</u>
              Indicates that the wait set will wait without a wait object but instead yield on every wait.

       <u>flags</u>  Flags  that set the default operation of the wait set.  The use of this field is reserved and must
              be set to 0 by the caller.

   <b>fi_close</b> <b>(deprecated)</b>
       The fi_close call releases all resources associated with a wait set.  The wait set must not be  bound  to
       any other opened resources prior to being closed, otherwise the call will return -FI_EBUSY.

   <b>fi_wait</b> <b>(deprecated)</b>
       Waits on a wait set until one or more of its underlying wait objects is signaled.

   <b>fi_trywait</b>
       The  fi_trywait  call was introduced in libfabric version 1.3.  The behavior of using native wait objects
       without the use of fi_trywait is provider specific and should be considered non-deterministic.

       The fi_trywait() call is used in conjunction with native operating system calls to block on wait objects,
       such as file descriptors.  The application must call fi_trywait and obtain a return value  of  FI_SUCCESS
       prior to blocking on a native wait object.  Failure to do so may result in the wait object not being sig‐
       naled,  and the application not observing the desired events.  The following pseudo-code demonstrates the
       use of fi_trywait in conjunction with the OS <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a>(2) call.

              fi_control(&amp;cq-&gt;fid, FI_GETWAIT, (void *) &amp;fd);
              FD_ZERO(&amp;fds);
              FD_SET(fd, &amp;fds);

              while (1) {
                  if (fi_trywait(&amp;cq, 1) == FI_SUCCESS)
                      select(fd + 1, &amp;fds, NULL, &amp;fds, &amp;timeout);

                  do {
                      ret = fi_cq_read(cq, &amp;comp, 1);
                  } while (ret &gt; 0);
              }

       fi_trywait() will return FI_SUCCESS if it is safe to block on the wait  object(s)  corresponding  to  the
       fabric  descriptor(s),  or  -FI_EAGAIN if there are events queued on the fabric descriptor or if blocking
       could hang the application.

       The call takes an array of fabric descriptors.  For each wait object that will be passed  to  the  native
       wait  routine,  the corresponding fabric descriptor should first be passed to fi_trywait.  All fabric de‐
       scriptors passed into a single fi_trywait call must make use of the same underlying wait object type.

       The following types of fabric descriptors may be passed into fi_trywait: event queues, completion queues,
       counters, and wait sets.  Applications that wish to use native wait calls should select specific wait ob‐
       jects when allocating such resources.  For example, by setting the  item’s  creation  attribute  wait_obj
       value to FI_WAIT_FD.

       In  the  case the wait object to check belongs to a wait set, only the wait set itself needs to be passed
       into fi_trywait.  The fabric resources associated with the wait set do not.

       On receiving a return value of -FI_EAGAIN from fi_trywait, an application should read all queued  comple‐
       tions  and  events, and call fi_trywait again before attempting to block.  Applications can make use of a
       fabric poll set to identify completion queues and counters that may require processing.

   <b>fi_control</b>
       The fi_control call is used to access provider or implementation specific details of a fids that  support
       blocking calls, such as wait sets, completion queues, counters, and event queues.  Access to the wait set
       or fid should be serialized across all calls when fi_control is invoked, as it may redirect the implemen‐
       tation of wait set operations.  The following control commands are usable with a wait set or fid.

       <u>FI_GETWAIT</u> <u>(void</u> <u>**)</u>
              This  command  allows the user to retrieve the low-level wait object associated with a wait set or
              fid.  The format of the wait set is specified during wait set creation, through the wait  set  at‐
              tributes.   The fi_control arg parameter should be an address where a pointer to the returned wait
              object will be written.  This should be an ’int *’  for  FI_WAIT_FD,  `struct  fi_mutex_cond'  for
              FI_WAIT_MUTEX_COND  (deprecated),  or  `struct  fi_wait_pollfd'  for  FI_WAIT_POLLFD.  Support for
              FI_GETWAIT is provider specific.

       <u>FI_GETWAITOBJ</u> <u>(enum</u> <u>fi_wait_obj</u> <u>*)</u>
              This command returns the type of wait object associated with a wait set or fid.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       Returns FI_SUCCESS on success.  On error, a negative value corresponding to fabric errno is returned.

       Fabric errno values are defined in <b>rdma/fi_errno.h</b>.

       fi_poll
              On success, if events are available, returns the number of entries written to the context array.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       In many situations, blocking calls may need to wait on signals sent to a number of file descriptors.  For
       example, this is the case for socket based providers, such as tcp and udp, as well as  utility  providers
       such  as multi-rail.  For simplicity, when epoll is available, it can be used to limit the number of file
       descriptors that an application must monitor.  The use of epoll may also be required in order to  support
       FI_WAIT_FD.

       However,  in  order to support waiting on multiple file descriptors on systems where epoll support is not
       available, or where epoll performance may negatively impact  performance,  FI_WAIT_POLLFD  provides  this
       mechanism.   A  significant  different  between  using  POLLFD  versus  FD  wait  objects  is  that  with
       FI_WAIT_POLLFD, the file descriptors may change dynamically.  As an example, the file descriptors associ‐
       ated with a completion queues’ wait set may change as endpoint associations with the CQ are added and re‐
       moved.

       Struct fi_wait_pollfd is used to retrieve all file descriptors for fids using FI_WAIT_POLLFD  to  support
       blocking calls.

              struct fi_wait_pollfd {
                  uint64_t      change_index;
                  size_t        nfds;
                  struct pollfd *fd;
              };

       <u>change_index</u>
              The  change_index  may  be used to determine if there have been any changes to the file descriptor
              list.  Anytime a file descriptor is added, removed, or its events are updated, this field  is  in‐
              cremented by the provider.  Applications wishing to wait on file descriptors directly should cache
              the  change_index  value.   Before  blocking on file descriptor events, the app should use fi_con‐
              trol() to retrieve the current change_index and compare that against its  cached  value.   If  the
              values differ, then the app should update its file descriptor list prior to blocking.

       <u>nfds</u>   On  input  to fi_control(), this indicates the number of entries in the struct pollfd * array.  On
              output, this will be set to the number of entries needed to store the current number of  file  de‐
              scriptors.   If the input value is smaller than the output value, fi_control() will return the er‐
              ror -FI_ETOOSMALL.  Note that setting nfds = 0 allows an efficient way of checking the  change_in‐
              dex.

       <u>fd</u>     This  points to an array of struct pollfd entries.  The number of entries is specified through the
              nfds field.  If the number of needed entries is less than or equal to the number of entries avail‐
              able, the struct pollfd array will be filled out with a list of file descriptors and corresponding
              events that can be used in the <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a>(2) and <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</a>(2) calls.

       The change_index is updated only when the file descriptors  associated  with  the  pollfd  file  set  has
       changed.   Checking  the  change_index is an additional step needed when working with FI_WAIT_POLLFD wait
       objects directly.  The use of the fi_trywait() function is still required if accessing wait  objects  di‐
       rectly.
