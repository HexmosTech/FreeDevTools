</pre><h4><b>REQUIRES</b></h4><pre>
       perl5.005, Pod::Parser, Exporter, Carp

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>podselect()</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NOTE:</b> <b>This</b> <b>module</b> <b>is</b> <b>considered</b> <b>legacy;</b> <b>modern</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>releases</b> <b>(5.31.1</b> <b>and</b> <b>higher)</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>Pod-</b>
       <b>Parser</b> <b>from</b> <b>core</b> <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>Pod::Simple</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>POD.</b>

       <b>podselect()</b> is a function which will extract specified sections of pod documentation from an input
       stream. This ability is provided by the <b>Pod::Select</b> module which is a subclass of <b>Pod::Parser</b>.
       <b>Pod::Select</b> provides a method named <b>select()</b> to specify the set of POD sections to select for
       processing/printing. <b>podselect()</b> merely creates a <b>Pod::Select</b> object and then invokes the <b>podselect()</b>
       followed by <b>parse_from_file()</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SECTION</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>podselect()</b> and <b>Pod::Select::select()</b> may be given one or more "section specifications" to restrict the
       text processed to only the desired set of sections and their corresponding subsections.  A section
       specification is a string containing one or more Perl-style regular expressions separated by forward
       slashes ("/").  If you need to use a forward slash literally within a section title you can escape it
       with a backslash ("\/").

       The formal syntax of a section specification is:

       •   <u>head1-title-regex</u>/<u>head2-title-regex</u>/...

       Any  omitted or empty regular expressions will default to ".*".  Please note that each regular expression
       given is implicitly anchored by adding "^" and "$" to the beginning and end.  Also, if  a  given  regular
       expression  starts  with  a "!" character, then the expression is <u>negated</u> (so "!foo" would match anything
       <u>except</u> "foo").

       Some example section specifications follow.

       •   Match the "NAME" and "SYNOPSIS" sections and all of their subsections:

           "NAME|SYNOPSIS"

       •   Match only the "Question" and "Answer" subsections of the "DESCRIPTION" section:

           "DESCRIPTION/Question|Answer"

       •   Match the "Comments" subsection of <u>all</u> sections:

           "/Comments"

       •   Match all subsections of "DESCRIPTION" <u>except</u> for "Comments":

           "DESCRIPTION/!Comments"

       •   Match the "DESCRIPTION" section but do <u>not</u> match any of its subsections:

           "DESCRIPTION/!.+"

       •   Match all top level sections but none of their subsections:

           "/!.+"

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods are provided in this module. Each one takes a reference to the object itself as  an
       implicit first parameter.

</pre><h4><b>curr_headings()</b></h4><pre>
                   ($head1, $head2, $head3, ...) = $parser-&gt;curr_headings();
                   $head1 = $parser-&gt;<a href="../man1/curr_headings.1.html">curr_headings</a>(1);

       This method returns a list of the currently active section headings and subheadings in the document being
       parsed. The list of headings returned corresponds to the most recently parsed paragraph of the input.

       If an argument is given, it must correspond to the desired section heading number, in which case only the
       specified  section  heading  is  returned. If there is no current section heading at the specified level,
       then "undef" is returned.

</pre><h4><b>select()</b></h4><pre>
                   $parser-&gt;select($section_spec1,$section_spec2,...);

       This method is used to select the particular sections and subsections of POD documentation that are to be
       printed and/or processed. The existing set of selected  sections  is  <u>replaced</u>  with  the  given  set  of
       sections.  See <b>add_selection()</b> for adding to the current set of selected sections.

       Each  of  the  $section_spec  arguments  should  be  a  section  specification  as  described in "SECTION
       SPECIFICATIONS".  The section specifications  are  parsed  by  this  method  and  the  resulting  regular
       expressions are stored in the invoking object.

       If no $section_spec arguments are given, then the existing set of selected sections is cleared out (which
       means "all" sections will be processed).

       This method should <u>not</u> normally be overridden by subclasses.

</pre><h4><b>add_selection()</b></h4><pre>
                   $parser-&gt;add_selection($section_spec1,$section_spec2,...);

       This  method  is used to add to the currently selected sections and subsections of POD documentation that
       are to be printed and/or processed. See &lt;<b>select()</b>&gt; for replacing the currently selected sections.

       Each of the  $section_spec  arguments  should  be  a  section  specification  as  described  in  "SECTION
       SPECIFICATIONS".  The  section  specifications  are  parsed  by  this  method  and  the resulting regular
       expressions are stored in the invoking object.

       This method should <u>not</u> normally be overridden by subclasses.

</pre><h4><b>clear_selections()</b></h4><pre>
                   $parser-&gt;clear_selections();

       This method takes no arguments, it has the exact same effect as invoking &lt;<b>select()</b>&gt; with no arguments.

</pre><h4><b>match_section()</b></h4><pre>
                   $boolean = $parser-&gt;match_section($heading1,$heading2,...);

       Returns a value of true if the given section and subsection heading titles match  any  of  the  currently
       selected  section  specifications in effect from prior calls to <b>select()</b> and <b>add_selection()</b> (or if there
       are no explicitly selected/deselected sections).

       The arguments  $heading1,  $heading2,  etc.  are  the  heading  titles  of  the  corresponding  sections,
       subsections,  etc.  to  try  and  match.   If  $headingN  is  omitted  then  it  defaults  to the current
       corresponding section heading title in the input.

       This method should <u>not</u> normally be overridden by subclasses.

</pre><h4><b>is_selected()</b></h4><pre>
                   $boolean = $parser-&gt;is_selected($paragraph);

       This method is used to determine if the block of text given in  $paragraph  falls  within  the  currently
       selected  set of POD sections and subsections to be printed or processed. This method is also responsible
       for keeping track of the current input section and subsections. It is assumed that $paragraph is the most
       recently read (but not yet processed) input paragraph.

       The value returned will be true if the $paragraph and the rest  of  the  text  in  the  same  section  as
       $paragraph should be selected (included) for processing; otherwise a false value is returned.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTED</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  functions are exported by this module. Please note that these are functions (not methods)
       and therefore "do not" take an implicit first argument.

</pre><h4><b>podselect()</b></h4><pre>
                   podselect(\%options,@filelist);

       <b>podselect</b> will print the raw (untranslated) POD paragraphs of all POD sections in the given  input  files
       specified by @filelist according to the options given in "\%options".

       If  any  argument  to  <b>podselect</b>  is  a  reference to a hash (associative array) then the values with the
       following keys are processed as follows:

       <b>-output</b>
           A string corresponding to the desired output file (or "&gt;&amp;STDOUT" or "&gt;&amp;STDERR"), or a  filehandle  to
           write on. The default is to use standard output.

       <b>-sections</b>
           A  reference  to an array of sections specifications (as described in "SECTION SPECIFICATIONS") which
           indicate the desired set of POD sections and subsections to be selected from  input.  If  no  section
           specifications are given, then all sections of the PODs are used.

       All  other arguments are optional and should correspond to filehandles to read from or the names of input
       files containing POD sections. A file name of "", "-" or "&lt;&amp;STDIN" will be interpreted to  mean  standard
       input (which is the default if no arguments are given).

</pre><h4><b>PRIVATE</b> <b>METHODS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Pod::Select</b>  makes uses a number of internal methods and data fields which clients should not need to see
       or use. For the sake of avoiding name collisions with client data and methods, these methods  and  fields
       are  briefly  discussed here. Determined hackers may obtain further information about them by reading the
       <b>Pod::Select</b> source code.

       Private data fields are stored in the hash-object whose reference is returned by  the  <b>new()</b>  constructor
       for  this class. The names of all private methods and data-fields used by <b>Pod::Select</b> begin with a prefix
       of "_" and match the regular expression "/^_\w+$/".
