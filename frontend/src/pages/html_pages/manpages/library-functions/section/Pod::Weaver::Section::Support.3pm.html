</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Weaver::Section::Support - Add a SUPPORT section to your POD

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.014

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This section plugin will produce a hunk of pod that lists the various ways to get support for this
       module. It will do this only if it is being built with Dist::Zilla because it needs the data from the
       dzil object.

       If you have Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Repository enabled in your <u>dist.ini</u>, be sure to check the
       repository_link attribute!

       This is added <b>ONLY</b> to the main module's POD, because it would be a waste of space to add it to all
       modules in the dist.

       For an example of what the hunk looks like, look at the "SUPPORT" section in this POD :)

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>all_modules</b>
       Enable this if you want to add the SUPPORT section to all the modules in a dist, not only the main one.

       The default is false.

   <b>perldoc</b>
       Specify if you want the paragraph explaining about perldoc to be displayed or not.

       The default is true.

   <b>bugs</b>
       Specify the bugtracker you want to use. You can use the CPAN RT tracker or your own, specified in the
       metadata.

       Valid options are: "rt", "metadata", or "none"

       If you pick the "rt" option, this module will generate a predefined block of text explaining how to use
       the RT system.

       If you pick the "metadata" option, this module will check the Dist::Zilla metadata for the bugtracker to
       display. Be sure to verify that your metadata contains both 'web' and 'mailto' keys if you want to use
       them in the content!

       The default is "rt".

   <b>bugs_content</b>
       Specify the content for the bugs section.

       Please put the "{EMAIL}" and "{WEB}" placeholders somewhere!

       The default is a sufficient explanation (see "SUPPORT").

   <b>websites</b>
       Specify what website links you want to see. This is an array, and you can pick any combination. You can
       also specify it as a comma-delimited string. The ordering of the options are important, as they are
       reflected in the final POD.

       Valid options are: "none", "metacpan", "rt", "kwalitee", "testers", "testmatrix", "deps" and "all".

       The default is "all".

               # Where the links go to:
               metacpan        - https://metacpan.org/release/$dist
               rt              - https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=$dist
               kwalitee        - <a href="http://cpants.perl.org/dist/">http://cpants.perl.org/dist/</a>$dist
               testers         - <a href="http://cpantesters.org/distro/">http://cpantesters.org/distro/</a>$first_char/$dist
               testmatrix      - <a href="http://matrix.cpantesters.org/">http://matrix.cpantesters.org/</a>?dist=$dist
               deps            - <a href="http://deps.cpantesters.org/">http://deps.cpantesters.org/</a>?module=$module

               # in weaver.ini
               [Support]
               websites = search
               websites = metacpan
               websites = testers , testmatrix

       P.S. If you know other websites that I should include here, please let me know!

   <b>websites_content</b>
       Specify the content to be displayed before the website list.

       The default is a sufficient explanation (see "SUPPORT").

   <b>irc</b>
       Specify an IRC server/channel/nick for online support. You can specify as many networks/channels as you
       want.  The ordering of the options are important, as they are reflected in the final POD.

       You specify a network, then a list of channels/nicks to ask for support. There are two ways to format the
       string:

               servername.com,#room,nick
               irc://servername.com/#room

       The default is none.

               # in weaver.ini
               [Support]
               irc = irc.home.org, #support, supportbot
               irc = irc.acme.com, #acmecorp, #acmehelp, #acmenewbies

       You can also add the irc information in the distribution metadata via Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Metadata.  The
       key is 'x_IRC' but you have to use the irc:// format to retain compatibility with the rest of the
       ecosystem.

               # in dist.ini
               [Metadata]
               x_IRC = irc://irc.perl.org/#perl

   <b>irc_content</b>
       Specify the content to be displayed before the irc network/channel list.

       The default is a sufficient explanation (see "SUPPORT").

   <b>repository_link</b>
       Specify which url to use when composing the external link.  The value corresponds to the repository meta
       resources (for dzil v3 with CPAN Meta v2).

       Valid options are: "url", "web", "both", or "none".

       "both" will include links to both the "url" and "web" in separate POD paragraphs.

       "none" will skip the repository item entirely.

       The default is "both".

       An error will be thrown if a specified link is not found because if you said that you wanted it you
       probably expect it to be there.

   <b>repository_content</b>
       Specify the content to be displayed before the link to the source code repository.

       The default is a sufficient explanation (see "SUPPORT").

   <b>email</b>
       Specify an email address here so users can contact you directly for help.

       If you supply a string without '@' in it, we assume it is a PAUSE id and mangle it into 'USER at
       cpan.org'.

       The default is none.

   <b>email_content</b>
       Specify the content for the email section.

       Please put the "{EMAIL}" placeholder somewhere!

       The default is a sufficient explanation ( see "SUPPORT").
