</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Weaver::Section::Generic - a generic section, found by lifting sections

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 4.020

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       This section will find and include a located hunk of Pod.  In general, it will find a "=head1" command
       with a content of the plugin's name.

       In other words, if your configuration include:

         [Generic]
         header = OVERVIEW

       ...then this weaver will look for "=head1 OVERVIEW" and include it at the appropriate location in your
       output.

       Since you'll probably want to use Generic several times, and that will require giving each use a unique
       name, you can omit "header" if you provide a plugin name, and it will default to the plugin name.  In
       other words, the configuration above could be specified just as:

         [Generic / OVERVIEW]

       If the "required" attribute is given, and true, then an exception will be raised if this section can't be
       found.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>required</b>
       A boolean value specifying whether this section is required to be present or not. Defaults to false.

       If it's enabled and the section can't be found an exception will be raised.

   <b>header</b>
       The name of this section. Defaults to the plugin name.
