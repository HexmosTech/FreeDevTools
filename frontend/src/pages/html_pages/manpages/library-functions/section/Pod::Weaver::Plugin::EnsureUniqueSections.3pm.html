</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Weaver::Plugin::EnsureUniqueSections - Ensure that POD has no duplicate section headers.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.163250

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       In <u>weaver.ini</u>

           [-EnsureUniqueSections]
           strict = 0 ; The default

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This plugin simply ensures that the POD after weaving has no duplicate top-level section headers. This
       can help you if you are converting from writing all your own POD to generating it with Pod::Weaver. If
       you begin generating a section with Pod::Weaver but you forget to delete the manually written section of
       the same name, this plugin will warn you.

       By default, this module does some tricks to detect similar headers, such as "AUTHOR" and "AUTHORS". You
       can turn this off by setting "strict = 1" in <u>weaver.ini</u>, in which case only <u>exactly</u> <u>identical</u> headers
       will be considered duplicates of each other.

   <b>DIAGNOSTIC</b> <b>MESSAGES</b>
       If any similar (or identical if "strict" is 1) section headers are found, all of their names will be
       listed on STDERR. Generally, you should take this list of modules and remove each from your POD. Then you
       should ensure that the sections generated by Pod::Weaver are suitable substitutes for those sections. In
       the case of similar names, only the first instance in each set of similar names will be listed.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>strict</b>
       If set to true (1), section headers will only be considered duplicates if they match exactly. If false
       (the default), certain similar section headers will be considered equivalent. The following similarities
       are considered (more may be added later):

       All whitespace and punctuation are equivalant
           For example, the following would all be considered duplicates of each other: " SEE ALSO", "SEE ALSO",
           "SEE,ALSO:".

       Case-insensitive
           For example, "Name" and "NAME" would be considered duplicates.

       Sets of words separated by "AND".
           For example, "COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE" would be considered a duplicate of "LICENSE AND COPYRIGHT".

       Plurals
           A  plural  noun is considered equivalent to its singular. For example, "AUTHOR" and "AUTHORS" are the
           same section. A section header consisting of multiple words, such as "DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY", is not
           affected by this rule.

           This rule uses  Lingua::EN::Inflect::Number  to  interconvert  between  singular  and  plural  forms.
           Hopefully you don't need to make a section called "OCTOPI".

       Note  that  these  rules  apply  recursively,  so  "Authors;  and Contributors" would be a duplicate of "
       CONTRIBUTORS AND AUTHOR".

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>prepare_input</b>
       This method modifies the weaver object by moving EnsureUniqueSections to the end of the  weaver's  plugin
       list to ensure that it gets to look at the final woven POD.

       THIS  IS  PURE  EVIL.  This  is  a hack to ensure that this plugin gets "the last word". Obviously if all
       plugins used this it would be total chaos. I welcome alternative suggestions. The main issue is that when
       other Finalizers, such as Section::Leftovers (which happens to  be  the  most  likely  plugin  to  create
       duplicate  sections),  produce  sections, this plugin will only see those sections if it runs after those
       Finalizers. Hence the need to be the last plugin on the list.

   <b>finalize_document</b>
       This method checks the document for duplicate headers, and throws an  error  if  any  are  found.  If  no
       duplicates are found, it simply does nothing. It does not modify the POD in any way.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Dist::Zilla</b> <b>testing</b> <b>plugin</b>
       I  would  like  to  convert this to a Dist::Zilla testing plugin, so that you can use it without enabling
       Pod::Weaver if you don't want to, but I haven't yet figured out how to find all files in a dist with  POD
       and extract all their headers. If anyone knows, please tell me.

   <b>No</b> <b>recursive</b> <b>duplicate</b> <b>checks</b>
       This  module  only  checks  for  duplicates in top-level headers (i.e.  "head1"). It could be extended to
       check the "head2" elements within each "head1" section and so on, but generally Pod::Weaver is not called
       upon to generate subsections, so you are unlikely to end up with duplicates at any level other  than  the
       first. However, if there is demand for recursive duplicate detection, I will add it.

       Please report any bugs or feature requests to "rct+<a href="mailto:perlbug@thompsonclan.org">perlbug@thompsonclan.org</a>".
