</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Config::MVP::Section - one section of an MVP configuration sequence

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.200013

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For the most part, you can just consult Config::MVP to understand what this class is and how it's used.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>name</b>
       This is the section's name.  It's a string, and it must be provided.

   <b>package</b>
       This is the (Perl) package with which the section is associated.  It is optional.  When the section is
       instantiated, it will ensure that this package is loaded.

   <b>multivalue_args</b>
       This attribute is an arrayref of value names that should be considered multivalue properties in the
       section.  When added to the section, they will always be wrapped in an arrayref, and they may be added to
       the section more than once.

       If this attribute is not given during construction, it will default to the result of calling section's
       package's "mvp_multivalue_args" method.  If the section has no associated package or if the package
       doesn't provide that method, it default to an empty arrayref.

   <b>aliases</b>
       This attribute is a hashref of name remappings.  For example, if it contains this hashref:

         {
           file =&gt; 'files',
           path =&gt; 'files',
         }

       Then attempting to set either the "file" or "path" setting for the section would actually set the "files"
       setting.

       If this attribute is not given during construction, it will default to the result of calling section's
       package's "mvp_aliases" method.  If the section has no associated package or if the package doesn't
       provide that method, it default to an empty hashref.

   <b>payload</b>
       This is the storage into which properties are set.  It is a hashref of names and values.  You should
       probably not alter the contents of the payload, and should read its contents only.

   <b>is_finalized</b>
       This attribute is true if the section has been marked finalized, which will prevent any new values from
       being added to it.  It can be set with the "finalize" method.

   <b>sequence</b>
       This attributes points to the sequence into which the section has been assembled.  It may be unset if the
       section has been created but not yet placed in a sequence.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>add_value</b>
         $section-&gt;add_value( $name =&gt; $value );

       This method sets the value for the named property to the given value.  If the property is a multivalue
       property, the new value will be pushed onto the end of an arrayref that will store all values for that
       property.

       Attempting to add a value for a non-multivalue property whose value was already added will result in an
       exception.

   <b>load_package</b>
         $section-&gt;load_package($package, $section_name);

       This method is used to ensure that the given $package is loaded, and is called whenever a section with a
       package is created.  By default, it delegates to Class::Load.  If the package can't be found, it calls
       the missing_package method.  Errors in compilation are not suppressed.

   <b>missing_package</b>
         $section-&gt;missing_package($package, $section_name);

       This method is called when "load_package" encounters a package that is not installed.  By default, it
       throws an exception.
