</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       YAML::Tiny - Read/Write YAML files with as little code as possible

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.76

</pre><h4><b>PREAMBLE</b></h4><pre>
       The YAML specification is huge. Really, <b>really</b> huge. It contains all the functionality of XML, except
       with flexibility and choice, which makes it easier to read, but with a formal specification that is more
       complex than XML.

       The original pure-Perl implementation YAML costs just over 4 megabytes of memory to load. Just like with
       Windows <u>.ini</u> files (3 meg to load) and CSS (3.5 meg to load) the situation is just asking for a
       <b>YAML::Tiny</b> module, an incomplete but correct and usable subset of the functionality, in as little code as
       possible.

       Like the other "::Tiny" modules, YAML::Tiny has no non-core dependencies, does not require a compiler to
       install, is back-compatible to Perl v5.8.1, and can be inlined into other modules if needed.

       In exchange for adding this extreme flexibility, it provides support for only a limited subset of YAML.
       But the subset supported contains most of the features for the more common uses of YAML.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Assuming <u>file.yml</u> like this:

           ---
           rootproperty: blah
           section:
             one: two
             three: four
             Foo: Bar
             empty: ~

       Read and write <u>file.yml</u> like this:

           use YAML::Tiny;

           # Open the config
           my $yaml = YAML::Tiny-&gt;read( 'file.yml' );

           # Get a reference to the first document
           my $config = $yaml-&gt;[0];

           # Or read properties directly
           my $root = $yaml-&gt;[0]-&gt;{rootproperty};
           my $one  = $yaml-&gt;[0]-&gt;{section}-&gt;{one};
           my $Foo  = $yaml-&gt;[0]-&gt;{section}-&gt;{Foo};

           # Change data directly
           $yaml-&gt;[0]-&gt;{newsection} = { this =&gt; 'that' }; # Add a section
           $yaml-&gt;[0]-&gt;{section}-&gt;{Foo} = 'Not Bar!';     # Change a value
           delete $yaml-&gt;[0]-&gt;{section};                  # Delete a value

           # Save the document back to the file
           $yaml-&gt;write( 'file.yml' );

       To create a new YAML file from scratch:

           # Create a new object with a single hashref document
           my $yaml = YAML::Tiny-&gt;new( { wibble =&gt; "wobble" } );

           # Add an arrayref document
           push @$yaml, [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ];

           # Save both documents to a file
           $yaml-&gt;write( 'data.yml' );

       Then <u>data.yml</u> will contain:

           ---
           wibble: wobble
           ---
           - foo
           - bar
           - baz

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>YAML::Tiny</b> is a perl class for reading and writing YAML-style files, written with as little code as
       possible, reducing load time and memory overhead.

       Most of the time it is accepted that Perl applications use a lot of memory and modules. The <b>::Tiny</b> family
       of modules is specifically intended to provide an ultralight and zero-dependency alternative to many
       more-thorough standard modules.

       This module is primarily for reading human-written files (like simple config files) and generating very
       simple human-readable files. Note that I said <b>human-readable</b> and not <b>geek-readable</b>. The sort of files
       that your average manager or secretary should be able to look at and make sense of.

       YAML::Tiny does not generate comments, it won't necessarily preserve the order of your hashes, and it
       will normalise if reading in and writing out again.

       It only supports a very basic subset of the full YAML specification.

       Usage is targeted at files like Perl's META.yml, for which a small and easily-embeddable module is
       extremely attractive.

       Features will only be added if they are human readable, and can be written in a few lines of code. Please
       don't be offended if your request is refused. Someone has to draw the line, and for YAML::Tiny that
       someone is me.

       If you need something with more power move up to YAML (7 megabytes of memory overhead) or YAML::XS (6
       megabytes memory overhead and requires a C compiler).

       To restate, YAML::Tiny does <b>not</b> preserve your comments, whitespace, or the order of your YAML data. But
       it should round-trip from Perl structure to file and back again just fine.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       The constructor "new" creates a "YAML::Tiny" object as a blessed array reference.  Any arguments provided
       are taken as separate documents to be serialized.

   <b>read</b> <b>$filename</b>
       The "read" constructor reads a YAML file from a file name, and returns a new "YAML::Tiny" object
       containing the parsed content.

       Returns the object on success or throws an error on failure.

   <b>read_string</b> <b>$string;</b>
       The "read_string" constructor reads YAML data from a character string, and returns a new "YAML::Tiny"
       object containing the parsed content.  If you have read the string from a file yourself, be sure that you
       have correctly decoded it into characters first.

       Returns the object on success or throws an error on failure.

   <b>write</b> <b>$filename</b>
       The "write" method generates the file content for the properties, and writes it to disk using UTF-8
       encoding to the filename specified.

       Returns true on success or throws an error on failure.

   <b>write_string</b>
       Generates the file content for the object and returns it as a character string.  This may contain non-
       ASCII characters and should be encoded before writing it to a file.

       Returns true on success or throws an error on failure.

   <b>errstr</b> <b>(DEPRECATED)</b>
       Prior to version 1.57, some errors were fatal and others were available only via the $YAML::Tiny::errstr
       variable, which could be accessed via the errstr() method.

       Starting with version 1.57, all errors are fatal and throw exceptions.

       The $errstr variable is still set when exceptions are thrown, but $errstr and the errstr() method are
       deprecated and may be removed in a future release.  The first use of errstr() will issue a deprecation
       warning.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       YAML::Tiny implements a number of functions to add compatibility with the YAML API. These should be a
       drop-in replacement.

   <b>Dump</b>
         my $string = Dump(list-of-Perl-data-structures);

       Turn Perl data into YAML. This function works very much like <b>Data::Dumper::Dumper()</b>.

       It takes a list of Perl data structures and dumps them into a serialized form.

       It returns a character string containing the YAML stream.  Be sure to encode it as UTF-8 before
       serializing to a file or socket.

       The structures can be references or plain scalars.

       Dies on any error.

   <b>Load</b>
         my @data_structures = Load(string-containing-a-YAML-stream);

       Turn YAML into Perl data. This is the opposite of Dump.

       Just like Storable's <b>thaw()</b> function or the <b>eval()</b> function in relation to Data::Dumper.

       It parses a character string containing a valid YAML stream into a list of Perl data structures
       representing the individual YAML documents.  Be sure to decode the character string  correctly if the
       string came from a file or socket.

         my $last_data_structure = Load(string-containing-a-YAML-stream);

       For consistency with YAML.pm, when Load is called in scalar context, it returns the data structure
       corresponding to the last of the YAML documents found in the input stream.

       Dies on any error.

   <b>freeze()</b> <b>and</b> <b>thaw()</b>
       Aliases to <b>Dump()</b> and <b>Load()</b> for Storable fans. This will also allow YAML::Tiny to be plugged directly
       into modules like POE.pm, that use the freeze/thaw API for internal serialization.

   <b>DumpFile(filepath,</b> <b>list)</b>
       Writes the YAML stream to a file with UTF-8 encoding instead of just returning a string.

       Dies on any error.

   <b>LoadFile(filepath)</b>
       Reads the YAML stream from a UTF-8 encoded file instead of a string.

       Dies on any error.

</pre><h4><b>YAML</b> <b>TINY</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       This section of the documentation provides a specification for "YAML Tiny", a subset of the YAML
       specification.

       It is based on and described comparatively to the YAML 1.1 Working Draft 2004-12-28 specification,
       located at &lt;<a href="http://yaml.org/spec/current.html">http://yaml.org/spec/current.html</a>&gt;.

       Terminology and chapter numbers are based on that specification.

   <b>1.</b> <b>Introduction</b> <b>and</b> <b>Goals</b>
       The purpose of the YAML Tiny specification is to describe a useful subset of the YAML specification that
       can be used for typical document-oriented use cases such as configuration files and simple data structure
       dumps.

       Many specification elements that add flexibility or extensibility are intentionally removed, as is
       support for complex data structures, class and object-orientation.

       In general, the YAML Tiny language targets only those data structures available in JSON, with the
       additional limitation that only simple keys are supported.

       As a result, all possible YAML Tiny documents should be able to be transformed into an equivalent JSON
       document, although the reverse is not necessarily true (but will be true in simple cases).

       As a result of these simplifications the YAML Tiny specification should be implementable in a
       (relatively) small amount of code in any language that supports Perl Compatible Regular Expressions
       (PCRE).

   <b>2.</b> <b>Introduction</b>
       YAML Tiny supports three data structures. These are scalars (in a variety of forms), block-form sequences
       and block-form mappings. Flow-style sequences and mappings are not supported, with some minor exceptions
       detailed later.

       The use of three dashes "---" to indicate the start of a new document is supported, and multiple
       documents per file/stream is allowed.

       Both line and inline comments are supported.

       Scalars are supported via the plain style, single quote and double quote, as well as literal-style and
       folded-style multi-line scalars.

       The use of explicit tags is not supported.

       The use of "null" type scalars is supported via the ~ character.

       The use of "bool" type scalars is not supported.

       However, serializer implementations should take care to explicitly escape strings that match a "bool"
       keyword in the following set to prevent other implementations that do support "bool" accidentally reading
       a string as a boolean

         y|Y|yes|Yes|YES|n|N|no|No|NO
         |true|True|TRUE|false|False|FALSE
         |on|On|ON|off|Off|OFF

       The use of anchors and aliases is not supported.

       The use of directives is supported only for the %YAML directive.

   <b>3.</b> <b>Processing</b> <b>YAML</b> <b>Tiny</b> <b>Information</b>
       <b>Processes</b>

       The YAML specification dictates three-phase serialization and three-phase deserialization.

       The YAML Tiny specification does not mandate any particular methodology or mechanism for parsing.

       Any compliant parser is only required to parse a single document at a time. The ability to support
       streaming documents is optional and most likely non-typical.

       Because anchors and aliases are not supported, the resulting representation graph is thus directed but
       (unlike the main YAML specification) <b>acyclic</b>.

       Circular references/pointers are not possible, and any YAML Tiny serializer detecting a circular
       reference should error with an appropriate message.

       <b>Presentation</b> <b>Stream</b>

       YAML Tiny reads and write UTF-8 encoded files.  Operations on strings expect or produce Unicode
       characters not UTF-8 encoded bytes.

       <b>Loading</b> <b>Failure</b> <b>Points</b>

       YAML Tiny parsers and emitters are not expected to recover from, or adapt to, errors. The specific error
       modality of any implementation is not dictated (return codes, exceptions, etc.) but is expected to be
       consistent.

   <b>4.</b> <b>Syntax</b>
       <b>Character</b> <b>Set</b>

       YAML Tiny streams are processed in memory as Unicode characters and read/written with UTF-8 encoding.

       The escaping and unescaping of the 8-bit YAML escapes is required.

       The escaping and unescaping of 16-bit and 32-bit YAML escapes is not required.

       <b>Indicator</b> <b>Characters</b>

       Support for the "~" null/undefined indicator is required.

       Implementations may represent this as appropriate for the underlying language.

       Support for the "-" block sequence indicator is required.

       Support for the "?" mapping key indicator is <b>not</b> required.

       Support for the ":" mapping value indicator is required.

       Support for the "," flow collection indicator is <b>not</b> required.

       Support for the "[" flow sequence indicator is <b>not</b> required, with one exception (detailed below).

       Support for the "]" flow sequence indicator is <b>not</b> required, with one exception (detailed below).

       Support for the "{" flow mapping indicator is <b>not</b> required, with one exception (detailed below).

       Support for the "}" flow mapping indicator is <b>not</b> required, with one exception (detailed below).

       Support for the "#" comment indicator is required.

       Support for the "&amp;" anchor indicator is <b>not</b> required.

       Support for the "*" alias indicator is <b>not</b> required.

       Support for the "!" tag indicator is <b>not</b> required.

       Support for the "|" literal block indicator is required.

       Support for the "&gt;" folded block indicator is required.

       Support for the "'" single quote indicator is required.

       Support for the """ double quote indicator is required.

       Support for the "%" directive indicator is required, but only for the special case of a %YAML version
       directive before the "---" document header, or on the same line as the document header.

       For example:

         %YAML 1.1
         ---
         - A sequence with a single element

       Special Exception:

       To provide the ability to support empty sequences and mappings, support for the constructs [] (empty
       sequence) and {} (empty mapping) are required.

       For example,

         %YAML 1.1
         # A document consisting of only an empty mapping
         --- {}
         # A document consisting of only an empty sequence
         --- []
         # A document consisting of an empty mapping within a sequence
         - foo
         - {}
         - bar

       <b>Syntax</b> <b>Primitives</b>

       Other than the empty sequence and mapping cases described above, YAML Tiny supports only the indentation-
       based block-style group of contexts.

       All five scalar contexts are supported.

       Indentation spaces work as per the YAML specification in all cases.

       Comments work as per the YAML specification in all simple cases.  Support for indented multi-line
       comments is <b>not</b> required.

       Separation spaces work as per the YAML specification in all cases.

       <b>YAML</b> <b>Tiny</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Stream</b>

       The only directive supported by the YAML Tiny specification is the %YAML language/version identifier.
       Although detected, this directive will have no control over the parsing itself.

       The parser must recognise both the YAML 1.0 and YAML 1.1+ formatting of this directive (as well as the
       commented form, although no explicit code should be needed to deal with this case, being a comment
       anyway)

       That is, all of the following should be supported.

         --- #YAML:1.0
         - foo

         %YAML:1.0
         ---
         - foo

         % YAML 1.1
         ---
         - foo

       Support for the %TAG directive is <b>not</b> required.

       Support for additional directives is <b>not</b> required.

       Support for the document boundary marker "---" is required.

       Support for the document boundary market "..." is <b>not</b> required.

       If necessary, a document boundary should simply be indicated with a "---" marker, with no preceding "..."
       marker.

       Support for empty streams (containing no documents) is required.

       Support for implicit document starts is required.

       That is, the following must be equivalent.

        # Full form
        %YAML 1.1
        ---
        foo: bar

        # Implicit form
        foo: bar

       <b>Nodes</b>

       Support for nodes optional anchor and tag properties is <b>not</b> required.

       Support for node anchors is <b>not</b> required.

       Support for node tags is <b>not</b> required.

       Support for alias nodes is <b>not</b> required.

       Support for flow nodes is <b>not</b> required.

       Support for block nodes is required.

       <b>Scalar</b> <b>Styles</b>

       Support for all five scalar styles is required as per the YAML specification, although support for quoted
       scalars spanning more than one line is <b>not</b> required.

       Support for multi-line scalar documents starting on the header is not required.

       Support for the chomping indicators on multi-line scalar styles is required.

       <b>Collection</b> <b>Styles</b>

       Support for block-style sequences is required.

       Support for flow-style sequences is <b>not</b> required.

       Support for block-style mappings is required.

       Support for flow-style mappings is <b>not</b> required.

       Both sequences and mappings should be able to be arbitrarily nested.

       Support for plain-style mapping keys is required.

       Support for quoted keys in mappings is <b>not</b> required.

       Support for "?"-indicated explicit keys is <b>not</b> required.

       Here endeth the specification.

   <b>Additional</b> <b>Perl-Specific</b> <b>Notes</b>
       For some Perl applications, it's important to know if you really have a number and not a string.

       That is, in some contexts is important that 3 the number is distinctive from "3" the string.

       Because even Perl itself is not trivially able to understand the difference (certainly without XS-based
       modules) Perl implementations of the YAML Tiny specification are not required to retain the
       distinctiveness of 3 vs "3".
