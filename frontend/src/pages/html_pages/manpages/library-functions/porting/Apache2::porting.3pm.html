       Apache2::porting -- a helper module for mod_perl 1.0 to mod_perl 2.0 porting

</pre><h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4><pre>
         # either add at the very beginning of startup.pl
         use Apache2::porting;

         # or httpd.conf
         PerlModule Apache2::porting

         # now issue requests and look at the error_log file for hints

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       "Apache2::porting" helps to port mod_perl 1.0 code to run under mod_perl 2.0. It doesn't provide any
       back-compatibility functionality, however it knows to trap methods calls that are no longer in the
       mod_perl 2.0 API and tell what should be used instead if at all. If you attempts to use mod_perl 2.0
       methods without first loading the modules that contain them, it will tell you which modules you need to
       load. Finally if your code tries to load modules that no longer exist in mod_perl 2.0 it'll also tell you
       what are the modules that should be used instead.

       "Apache2::porting" communicates with users via the <u>error_log</u> file. Every time it traps a problem, it logs
       the solution (if it finds one) to the error log file. If you use this module coupled with
       "Apache2::Reload" you will be able to port your applications quickly without needing to restart the
       server on every modification.

       It starts to work only when child process start and doesn't work for the code that gets loaded at the
       server startup. This limitation is explained in the Culprits section.

       It relies heavily on "ModPerl::MethodLookup".  which can also be used manually to lookup things.

</pre><h4><b>Culprits</b></h4><pre>
       "Apache2::porting" uses the "UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD" function to provide its functionality. However it seems
       to be impossible to create "UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD" at the server startup, Apache segfaults on restart.
       Therefore it performs the setting of "UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD" only during the <u>child_init</u> phase, when child
       processes start. As a result it can't help you with things that get preloaded at the server startup.

       If you know how to resolve this problem, please let us know. To reproduce the problem try to use an
       earlier phase, e.g. "PerlPostConfigHandler":

         Apache2::ServerUtil-&gt;server-&gt;push_handlers(PerlPostConfigHandler =&gt; \&amp;porting_autoload);

       META: Though there is a better solution at work, which assigns AUTOLOAD for each class separately,
       instead of using UNIVERSAL. See the discussion on the dev list (hint: search the archive for EazyLife)
