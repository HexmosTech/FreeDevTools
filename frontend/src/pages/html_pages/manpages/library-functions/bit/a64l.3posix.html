</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       a64l, l64a — convert between a 32-bit integer and a radix-64 ASCII string

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</a>&gt;

       long a64l(const char *<u>s</u>);
       char *l64a(long <u>value</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These  functions maintain numbers stored in radix-64 ASCII characters. This is a notation by which 32-bit
       integers can be represented by up to six characters;  each  character  represents  a  digit  in  radix-64
       notation. If the type <b>long</b> contains more than 32 bits, only the low-order 32 bits shall be used for these
       operations.

       The  characters used to represent digits are <b>'.'</b>  (dot) for 0, <b>'/'</b> for 1, <b>'0'</b> through <b>'9'</b> for [2,11], <b>'A'</b>
       through <b>'Z'</b> for [12,37], and <b>'a'</b> through <b>'z'</b> for [38,63].

       The <u>a64l</u>() function shall take a pointer to a radix-64 representation, in which the first  digit  is  the
       least  significant,  and return the corresponding <b>long</b> value. If the string pointed to by <u>s</u> contains more
       than six characters, <u>a64l</u>() shall use the first six. If the first six characters of the string contain  a
       null  terminator,  <u>a64l</u>()  shall  use  only characters preceding the null terminator. The <u>a64l</u>() function
       shall scan the character string from left to right with the least significant digit on the left, decoding
       each character as a 6-bit radix-64 number. If the type <b>long</b> contains more than  32  bits,  the  resulting
       value  is  sign-extended.  The  behavior  of  <u>a64l</u>()  is unspecified if <u>s</u> is a null pointer or the string
       pointed to by <u>s</u> was not generated by a previous call to <u>l64a</u>().

       The <u>l64a</u>() function shall take a <b>long</b> argument  and  return  a  pointer  to  the  corresponding  radix-64
       representation. The behavior of <u>l64a</u>() is unspecified if <u>value</u> is negative.

       The  value  returned  by  <u>l64a</u>()  may  be  a pointer into a static buffer. Subsequent calls to <u>l64a</u>() may
       overwrite the buffer.

       The <u>l64a</u>() function need not be thread-safe.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, <u>a64l</u>() shall return the <b>long</b> value resulting from  conversion  of  the  input
       string. If a string pointed to by <u>s</u> is an empty string, <u>a64l</u>() shall return 0L.

       The  <u>l64a</u>()  function shall return a pointer to the radix-64 representation. If <u>value</u> is 0L, <u>l64a</u>() shall
       return a pointer to an empty string.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       If the type <b>long</b> contains more than 32 bits, the result of <u>a64l</u>(<u>l64a</u>(<u>x</u>)) is <u>x</u> in the low-order 32 bits.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       This is not the same encoding as used by either encoding variant of the <u>uuencode</u> utility.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
