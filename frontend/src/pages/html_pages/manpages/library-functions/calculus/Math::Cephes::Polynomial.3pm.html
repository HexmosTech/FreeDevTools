</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is a layer on top of the basic routines in the cephes math library to handle polynomials. In
       the following, a Math::Cephes::Polynomial object is created as

         my $p = Math::Cephes::Polynomial-&gt;new($arr_ref);

       where $arr_ref is a reference to an array which can consist of one of

       •   floating point numbers, for polynomials with floating point coefficients,

       •   <u>Math::Cephes::Fraction</u> or <u>Math::Fraction</u> objects, for polynomials with fractional coefficients,

       •   <u>Math::Cephes::Complex</u> or <u>Math::Complex</u> objects, for polynomials with complex coefficients,

       The  maximum  degree of the polynomials handled is set by default to 256 - this can be changed by setting
       <u>$Math::Cephes::Polynomial::MAXPOL</u>.

       A copy of a <u>Math::Cephes::Polynomial</u> object may be done as

         my $p_copy = $p-&gt;new();

       and a string representation of the polynomial may be gotten through

         print $p-&gt;as_string;

   <b>Methods</b>
       The following methods are available.

       <u>coef</u>: get coefficients of the polynomial
            SYNOPSIS:

            my $c = $p-&gt;coef;

            DESCRIPTION:

           This returns an array reference containing the coefficients of the polynomial.

       <u>clr</u>: set a polynomial identically equal to zero
            SYNOPSIS:

            $p-&gt;clr($n);

            DESCRIPTION:

           This sets the coefficients of the polynomial identically to 0, up to $p-&gt;[$n]. If $n is omitted,  all
           elements are set to 0.

       <u>add</u>: add two polynomials
            SYNOPSIS:

            $c = $a-&gt;add($b);

            DESCRIPTION:

           This sets $c equal to $a + $b.

       <u>sub</u>: subtract two polynomials
            SYNOPSIS:

            $c = $a-&gt;sub($b);

            DESCRIPTION:

           This sets $c equal to $a - $b.

       <u>mul</u>: multiply two polynomials
            SYNOPSIS:

            $c = $a-&gt;mul($b);

            DESCRIPTION:

           This sets $c equal to $a * $b.

       <u>div</u>: divide two polynomials
            SYNOPSIS:

            $c = $a-&gt;div($b);

            DESCRIPTION:

           This  sets  $c  equal to $a / $b, expanded by a Taylor series. Accuracy is approximately equal to the
           degree of the polynomial, with an internal limit of about 16.

       <u>sbt</u>: change of variables
            SYNOPSIS:

            $c = $a-&gt;sbt($b);

            DESCRIPTION:

           If a(x) and b(x) are polynomials, then

                c(x) = a(b(x))

           is a polynomial found by substituting  b(x)  for  x  in  a(x).  This  method  is  not  available  for
           polynomials with complex coefficients.

       <u>eval</u>: evaluate a polynomial
            SYNOPSIS:

            $s = $a-&gt;eval($x);

            DESCRIPTION:

           This evaluates the polynomial at the value $x. The returned value is of the same type as that used to
           represent the coefficients of the polynomial.

       <u>sqt</u>: square root of a polynomial
            SYNOPSIS:

            $b = $a-&gt;sqt();

            DESCRIPTION:

           This  finds  the  square  root  of  a  polynomial,  evaluated  by  a  Taylor  expansion.  Accuracy is
           approximately equal to the degree of the polynomial, with an internal limit of about 16.  This method
           is not available for polynomials with complex coefficients.

       <u>sin</u>: sine of a polynomial
            SYNOPSIS:

            $b = $a-&gt;sin();

            DESCRIPTION:

           This finds the sine of a polynomial, evaluated by a Taylor expansion. Accuracy is approximately equal
           to the degree of the polynomial, with an internal limit of about 16.  This method  is  not  available
           for polynomials with complex coefficients.

       <u>cos</u>: cosine of a polynomial
            SYNOPSIS:

            $b = $a-&gt;cos();

            DESCRIPTION:

           This  finds  the  cosine  of a polynomial, evaluated by a Taylor expansion. Accuracy is approximately
           equal to the degree of the polynomial, with an internal limit  of  about  16.   This  method  is  not
           available for polynomials with complex coefficients.

       <u>atn</u>: arctangent of the ratio of two polynomials
            SYNOPSIS:

            $c = $a-&gt;atn($b);

            DESCRIPTION:

           This  finds  the  arctangent of the ratio $a / $b of two polynomial, evaluated by a Taylor expansion.
           Accuracy is approximately equal to the degree of the polynomial, with an internal limit of about  16.
           This method is not available for polynomials with complex coefficients.

       <u>rts</u>: roots of a polynomial
            SYNOPSIS:

             my $w = Math::Cephes::Polynomial-&gt;new([-2, 0, -1, 0, 1]);
             my ($flag, $r) = $w-&gt;rts();
             for (my $i=0; $i&lt;4; $i++) {
               print "Root $i has real=", $r-&gt;[$i]-&gt;r, " and imag=", $r-&gt;[$i]-&gt;i, "\n";
             }

            DESCRIPTION:

           This finds the roots of a polynomial. <u>$flag</u>, if non-zero, indicates a failure of some kind. <u>$roots</u> in
           an  array reference of <u>Math::Cephes::Complex</u> objects holding the real and complex values of the roots
           found.  This method is not available for polynomials with complex coefficients.

            ACCURACY:

           Termination depends on evaluation of the polynomial at the trial values of the roots.  The values  of
           multiple roots or of roots that are nearly equal may have poor relative accuracy after the first root
           in the neighborhood has been found.
