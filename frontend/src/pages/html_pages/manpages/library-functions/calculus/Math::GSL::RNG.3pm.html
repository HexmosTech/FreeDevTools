       Math::GSL::RNG - Random Number Generators

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Math::GSL::RNG;
           my $rng     = Math::GSL::RNG-&gt;new;
           my @random  = $rng-&gt;<a href="../man100/get.100.html">get</a>(100);

</pre><h4><b>Object</b> <b>Oriented</b> <b>Interface</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Math::GSL::RNG-&gt;new($type,</b> <b>$seed)</b>
           my $rng = Math::GSL::RNG-&gt;new;
           my $rng = Math::GSL::RNG-&gt;new($gsl_rng_knuthran,5);

       Creates a new RNG object of type $type, seeded with $seed. Both of these parameters are optional. The
       type $gsl_rng_default is used when no $type is given.

   <b>copy()</b>
           my $copy = $rng-&gt;copy;

       Make a copy of a RNG object.

   <b>free()</b>
           $rng-&gt;free();

       Free memory associated with RNG object.

   <b>name()</b>
          my $name = $rng-&gt;name();

       Get the name of the RNG object as a string.

   <b>get()</b>
           my $nextval  = $rng-&gt;get;
           my (@values) = $rng-&gt;<a href="../man100/get.100.html">get</a>(100);

       Get the next random value from the RNG object. If given an integer N, returns the next N values.

   <b>raw()</b>
           my $raw = $rng-&gt;raw();

       Return the raw GSL RNG object, useful for functions which take a RNG, such as the Monte Carlo integration
       functions or the random number distribution functions in Math::GSL::Randist.

   <b>shuffle()</b>
          my @array = $rng-&gt;shuffle(@other_array);

       Given a RNG, shuffle an array.

   <b>choose()</b>
          my @array = $rng-&gt;choose(4, @other_array);

       This function fills the destination array with k objects taken randomly from the n elements of the array
       argument.  The objects are sampled without replacement, thus each object can only appear once in
       destination array. It is required that k be less than or equal to n.

   <b>sample()</b>
          my @array = $rng-&gt;sample(4, @other_array);

       This method is like "choose" but samples k items from the original array of n items src with replacement,
       so the same object can appear more than once in the output sequence dest. There is no requirement that k
       be less than n in this case.

</pre><h4><b>GSL</b> <b>API</b> <b>Interface</b></h4><pre>
       gsl_rng_alloc($T) - This function returns a pointer to a newly-created instance of a random number
       generator of type $T. $T must be one of the constants below. The generator is automatically initialized
       with the default seed, $gsl_rng_default.
       gsl_rng_set($r, $s) - This function initializes (or `seeds') the random number generator. If the
       generator is seeded with the same value of $s on two different runs, the same stream of random numbers
       will be generated by successive calls to the routines below. If different values of $s are supplied, then
       the generated streams of random numbers should be completely different. If the seed $s is zero then the
       standard seed from the original implementation is used instead. For example, the original Fortran source
       code for the ranlux generator used a seed of 314159265, and so choosing $s equal to zero reproduces this
       when using $gsl_rng_ranlux.
       gsl_rng_get($r) - This function returns a random integer from the generator $r. The minimum and maximum
       values depend on the algorithm used, but all integers in the range [min,max] are equally likely. The
       values of min and max can determined using the auxiliary functions gsl_rng_max($r) and gsl_rng_min($r).
       gsl_rng_free($r) - This function frees all the memory associated with the generator $r.
       gsl_rng_memcpy($dest, $src) - This function copies the random number generator $src into the pre-existing
       generator $dest, making $dest into an exact copy of $src. The two generators must be of the same type.
       gsl_rng_uniform($r) - This function returns a double precision floating point number uniformly
       distributed in the range [0,1). The range includes 0.0 but excludes 1.0. The value is typically obtained
       by dividing the result of gsl_rng_get($r) by gsl_rng_max($r) + 1.0 in double precision. Some generators
       compute this ratio internally so that they can provide floating point numbers with more than 32 bits of
       randomness (the maximum number of bits that can be portably represented in a single unsigned long int).
       gsl_rng_uniform_pos($r) - This function returns a positive double precision floating point number
       uniformly distributed in the range (0,1), excluding both 0.0 and 1.0. The number is obtained by sampling
       the generator with the algorithm of gsl_rng_uniform until a non-zero value is obtained. You can use this
       function if you need to avoid a singularity at 0.0.
       gsl_rng_uniform_int($r, $n) - This function returns a random integer from 0 to $n-1 inclusive by scaling
       down and/or discarding samples from the generator $r. All integers in the range [0,$n-1] are produced
       with equal probability. For generators with a non-zero minimum value an offset is applied so that zero is
       returned with the correct probability. Note that this function is designed for sampling from ranges
       smaller than the range of the underlying generator. The parameter $n must be less than or equal to the
       range of the generator $r. If $n is larger than the range of the generator then the function calls the
       error handler with an error code of $GSL_EINVAL and returns zero. In particular, this function is not
       intended for generating the full range of unsigned integer values [0,2^32-1]. Instead choose a generator
       with the maximal integer range and zero minimum value, such as $gsl_rng_ranlxd1, $gsl_rng_mt19937 or
       $gsl_rng_taus, and sample it directly using gsl_rng_get. The range of each generator can be found using
       the auxiliary functions described in the next section.
       gsl_rng_fwrite($stream, $r) - This function writes the random number state of the random number generator
       $r to the stream $stream (opened with the gsl_fopen function from the Math::GSL module) in binary format.
       The return value is 0 for success and $GSL_EFAILED if there was a problem writing to the file. Since the
       data is written in the native binary format it may not be portable between different architectures.
       gsl_rng_fread($stream, $r) - This function reads the random number state into the random number generator
       $r from the open stream $stream (opened with the gsl_fopen function from the Math::GSL module) in binary
       format. The random number generator $r must be preinitialized with the correct random number generator
       type since type information is not saved. The return value is 0 for success and $GSL_EFAILED if there was
       a problem reading from the file. The data is assumed to have been written in the native binary format on
       the same architecture.
       gsl_rng_clone($r) - This function returns a pointer to a newly created generator which is an exact copy
       of the generator $r.
       gsl_rng_max($r) - This function returns the largest value that gsl_rng_get can return.
       gsl_rng_min($r) - gsl_rng_min returns the smallest value that gsl_rng_get can return. Usually this value
       is zero. There are some generators with algorithms that cannot return zero, and for these generators the
       minimum value is 1.
       gsl_rng_name($r) - This function returns a pointer to the name of the generator. For example,
        print "r is a " . gsl_rng_name($r) . "generator\n";
        would print something like r is a 'taus' generator.
       gsl_rng_size($r) - This function returns the size of the state of generator $r. You can use this
       information to access the state directly.
       gsl_rng_state($r) - This function returns a pointer to the state of generator $r. You can use this
       information to access the state directly.
       gsl_rng_print_state($r)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following example will print out a list a random integers between certain minimum and maximum values.
       The  command  line arguments are first the number of random numbers wanted, the minimum and then maximum.
       The defaults are 10, 0 and 100, respectively.

           use Math::GSL::RNG qw/:all/;
           my $seed = int <a href="../man100/rand.100.html">rand</a>(100);
           my $rng  = Math::GSL::RNG-&gt;new($gsl_rng_knuthran, $seed );
           my ($num,$min,$max) = @ARGV;
           $num ||= 10;
           $min ||= 0;
           $max ||= 100;
           print join "\n", map { $min + $rng-&gt;get % ($max-$min+1)  } (1..$num);
           print "\n";

       The $seed argument is optional but encouraged. This program is available in the <b>examples/</b> directory  that
       comes with the source of this module.

       If  you would like a series of random non-integer numbers, then you can generate one "scaling factor" and
       multiple by that, such as

           use Math::GSL::RNG qw/:all/;
           my $scale= <a href="../man10/rand.10.html">rand</a>(10);
           my $seed = int <a href="../man100/rand.100.html">rand</a>(100);
           my $rng  = Math::GSL::RNG-&gt;new($gsl_rng_knuthran, $seed );
           my ($num,$min,$max) = (10,0,100);
           print join "\n", map { $scale*($min + $rng-&gt;get % ($max-$min+1))  } (1..$num);
           print "\n";
