</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Math::Calculus::Differentiate - Algebraic Differentiation Engine

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Math::Calculus::Differentiate;

         # Create an object.
         my $exp = Math::Calculus::Differentiate-&gt;new;

         # Set a variable and expression.
         $exp-&gt;addVariable('x');
         $exp-&gt;setExpression('x^2 + 5*x') or die $exp-&gt;getError;

         # Differentiate and simplify.
         $exp-&gt;differentiate or die $exp-&gt;getError;;
         $exp-&gt;simplify or die $exp-&gt;getError;;

         # Print the result.
         print $exp-&gt;getExpression; # Prints 2*x + 5

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module can take an algebraic expression, parse it into a tree structure, modify the tree to give a
       representation of the differentiated function, simplify the tree and turn the tree back into an output of
       the same form as the input.

       It supports differentiation of expressions including the +, -, *, / and ^ (raise to power) operators,
       bracketed expressions to enable correct precedence and the functions ln, exp, sin, cos, tan, sec, cosec,
       cot, sinh, cosh, tanh, sech, cosech, coth, asin, acos, atan, asinh, acosh and atanh.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORT</b></h4><pre>
       None by default.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new
             $exp = Math::Calculus::Differentiate-&gt;new;

           Creates a new instance of the differentiation engine, which can hold an individual expression.

       addVariable
             $exp-&gt;addVariable('x');

           Sets a certain named value in the expression as being a variable. A named value must be an alphabetic
           character.

       setExpression
             $exp-&gt;setExpression('x^2 + 5*x);

           Takes  an expression in human-readable form and stores it internally as a tree structure, checking it
           is a valid expression that the module can understand in the process. Note that the engine  is  strict
           about  syntax. For example, note above that you must write 5*x and not just 5x. Whitespace is allowed
           in the expression, but does not have any effect on precedence.  If you require control of precedence,
           use brackets; bracketed expressions will always be evaluated first, as you would normally expect. The
           module follows the BODMAS precedence convention. Returns  undef  on  failure  and  a  true  value  on
           success.

       getExpression
             $expr = $exp-&gt;getExpression;

           Returns a textaul, human readable representation of the expression that is being stored.

       differentiate
             $exp-&gt;differentiate('x');

           Differentiates  the expression that was stored with setExpression with respect to the variable passed
           as a parameter. Returns undef on failure and a true value on success.

       simplify
             $exp-&gt;simplify;

           Attempts to simplify the expression that is stored internally. It is a very good idea  to  call  this
           after  calling  differentiate,  as  the tree will often not be in the most compact possible form, and
           this will affect the readability of output from getExpression and the performance of future calls  to
           differentiate  if you are intending to obtain higher derivatives. Returns undef on failure and a true
           value on success.

       getTraceback
             $exp-&gt;getTraceback;

           When setExpression and differentiate are called, a traceback is  generated  to  describe  what  these
           functions  did.  If an error occurs, this traceback can be extremely useful in helping track down the
           source of the error.

       getError
             $exp-&gt;getError;

           When any method other than getTraceback is called, the error message stored is cleared, and then  any
           errors  that occur during the execution of the method are stored. If failure occurs, call this method
           to get a textual representation of the error.
