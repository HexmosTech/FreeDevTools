</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Devel::Backtrace - Object-oriented backtrace

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This is version 0.12.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $backtrace = Devel::Backtrace-&gt;new;

           print $backtrace; # use automatic stringification
                             # See EXAMPLES to see what the output might look like

           print $backtrace-&gt;<a href="../man0/point.0.html">point</a>(0)-&gt;line;

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Devel::Backtrace-&gt;new()</b>
       Optional parameters: -start =&gt; $start, -format =&gt; $format

       If only one parameter is given, it will be used as $start.

       Constructs a new "Devel::Backtrace" which is filled with all the information "caller($i)" provides, where
       $i starts from $start.  If no argument is given, $start defaults to 0.

       If $start is 1 (or higher), the backtrace won't contain the information that (and where)
       <b>Devel::Backtrace::new()</b> was called.

   <b>$backtrace-&gt;point($i)</b>
       Returns the i'th tracepoint as a Devel::Backtrace::Point object (see its documentation for how to access
       every bit of information).

       Note that the following code snippet will print the information of "caller($start+$i)":

           print Devel::Backtrace-&gt;new($start)-&gt;point($i)

   <b>$backtrace-&gt;points()</b>
       Returns a list of all tracepoints.  In scalar context, the number of tracepoints is returned.

   <b>$backtrace-&gt;skipme([$package])</b>
       This method deletes all leading tracepoints that contain information about calls within $package.
       Afterwards the $backtrace will look as though it had been created with a higher value of $start.

       If the optional parameter $package is not given, it defaults to the calling package.

       The effect is similar to what the Carp module does.

       This module ships with an example "skipme.pl" that demonstrates how to use this method.  See also
       "EXAMPLES".

   <b>$backtrace-&gt;skipmysubs([$package])</b>
       This method is like "skipme" except that it deletes calls <u>to</u> the package rather than calls <u>from</u> the
       package.

       Before discarding those calls, "skipme" is called.  This is because usually the topmost call in the stack
       is to Devel::Backtrace-&gt;new, which would not be catched by "skipmysubs" otherwise.

       This means that skipmysubs usually deletes more lines than skipme would.

       "skipmysubs" was added in Devel::Backtrace version 0.06.

       See also "EXAMPLES" and the example "skipme.pl".

   <b>$backtrace-&gt;to_string()</b>
       Returns a string that contains one line for each tracepoint.  It will contain the information from
       "Devel::Backtrace::Point"'s <b>to_string()</b> method.  To get more information, use the <b>to_long_string()</b>
       method.

       Note that you don't have to call <b>to_string()</b> if you print a "Devel::Backtrace" object or otherwise treat
       it as a string, as the stringification operator is overloaded.

       See "EXAMPLES".

   <b>$backtrace-&gt;to_long_string()</b>
       Returns a very long string that contains several lines for each trace point.  The result will contain
       every available bit of information.  See "to_long_string" in Devel::Backtrace::Point for an example of
       what the result looks like.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       A sample stringification might look like this:

           Devel::Backtrace::new called from MyPackage (foo.pl:30)
           MyPackage::test2 called from MyPackage (foo.pl:28)
           MyPackage::test1 called from main (foo.pl:18)
           main::bar called from main (foo.pl:6)
           main::foo called from main (foo.pl:13)

       If MyPackage called skipme, the first two lines would be removed.  If it called skipmysubs, the first
       three lines would be removed.

       If you don't like the format, you can change it:

           my $backtrace = Devel::Backtrace-&gt;new(-format =&gt; '%I. %s');

       This would produce a stringification of the following form:

           0. Devel::Backtrace::new
           1. MyPackage::test2
           2. MyPackage::test1
           3. main::bar
           4. main::foo

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Devel::StackTrace does mostly the same as this module.  I'm afraid I hadn't noticed it until I uploaded
       this module.

       Carp::Trace is a simpler module which gives you a backtrace in string form.

       Devel::DollarAt comes with this distribution and is a nice application of this module.  You can use it
       for debugging to get a backtrace out of $@.
