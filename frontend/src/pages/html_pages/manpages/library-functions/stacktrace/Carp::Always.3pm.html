</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Carp::Always - Warns and dies noisily with stack backtraces

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Carp::Always;

       Often used on the command line:

         perl -MCarp::Always script.pl

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is meant as a debugging aid. It can be used to make a script complain loudly with stack
       backtraces when <u>warn()</u>ing or <u>die()</u>ing.

       Here are how stack backtraces produced by this module looks:

         # it works for explicit die's and warn's
         $ perl -MCarp::Always -e 'sub f { die "arghh" }; sub g { f }; g'
         arghh at -e line 1
                 main::f() called at -e line 1
                 main::g() called at -e line 1

         # it works for interpreter-thrown failures
         $ perl -MCarp::Always -w -e 'sub f { $a = shift; @a = @$a };' \
                                  -e 'sub g { f(undef) }; g'
         Use of uninitialized value in array dereference at -e line 1
                 main::f('undef') called at -e line 2
                 main::g() called at -e line 2

       In the implementation, the Carp module does the heavy work, through "longmess()". The actual
       implementation sets the signal hooks $SIG{__WARN__} and $SIG{__DIE__} to emit the stack backtraces.

       Also, all uses of "carp" and "croak" are made verbose, behaving like "cluck" and "confess".

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Carp::Always implements the following methods.

   <b>import</b>
         Carp::Always-&gt;import()

       Enables Carp::Always. Also triggered by statements like

         use Carp::Always;
         use Carp::Always 0.14;

       but not by

         use Carp::Always ();    # does not invoke import()

   <b>unimport</b>
         Carp::Always-&gt;unimport();

       Disables Carp::Always. Also triggered with

         no Carp::Always;

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       This module was born as a reaction to a release of Acme::JavaTrace by Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni.
       Sébastien also has a newer module called Devel::SimpleTrace with the same code and fewer flame comments
       on docs. The pruning of the uselessly long docs of this module was prodded by Michael Schwern.

       Schwern and others told me "the module name stinked" - it was called "Carp::Indeed". After thinking long
       and getting nowhere, I went with nuffin's suggestion and now it is called "Carp::Always".

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Carp

       Acme::JavaTrace and Devel::SimpleTrace

       Carp::Always::Color

       Carp::Source::Always

       Devel::Confess

       Carp::Always::SyntaxHighlightSource and Carp::Always::DieOnly

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       •   This  module  does  not  play  well  with  other  modules  which  fusses  around  with "warn", "die",
           $SIG{__WARN__}, $SIG{__DIE__}.

       •   Test scripts are good. I should write more of these.
