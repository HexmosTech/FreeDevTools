        <b>CGELS</b> <b>solves</b> <b>overdetermined</b> <b>or</b> <b>underdetermined</b> <b>systems</b> <b>for</b> <b>GE</b> <b>matrices</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CGELS solves overdetermined or underdetermined complex linear systems
            involving an M-by-N matrix A, or its conjugate-transpose, using a QR
            or LQ factorization of A.

            It is assumed that A has full rank, and only a rudimentary protection
            against rank-deficient matrices is provided. This subroutine only detects
            exact rank-deficiency, where a diagonal element of the triangular factor
            of A is exactly zero.

            It is conceivable for one (or more) of the diagonal elements of the triangular
            factor of A to be subnormally tiny numbers without this subroutine signalling
            an error. The solutions computed for such almost-rank-deficient matrices may
            be less accurate due to a loss of numerical precision.

            The following options are provided:

            1. If TRANS = 'N' and m &gt;= n:  find the least squares solution of
               an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
                            minimize || B - A*X ||.

            2. If TRANS = 'N' and m &lt; n:  find the minimum norm solution of
               an underdetermined system A * X = B.

            3. If TRANS = 'C' and m &gt;= n:  find the minimum norm solution of
               an underdetermined system A**H * X = B.

            4. If TRANS = 'C' and m &lt; n:  find the least squares solution of
               an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
                            minimize || B - A**H * X ||.

            Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
            handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
            M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution
            matrix X.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>TRANS</u>

                     TRANS is CHARACTER*1
                     = 'N': the linear system involves A;
                     = 'C': the linear system involves A**H.

           <u>M</u>

                     M is INTEGER
                     The number of rows of the matrix A.  M &gt;= 0.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                     The number of columns of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>NRHS</u>

                     NRHS is INTEGER
                     The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of
                     columns of the matrices B and X. NRHS &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
                       if M &gt;= N, A is overwritten by details of its QR
                                  factorization as returned by CGEQRF;
                       if M &lt;  N, A is overwritten by details of its LQ
                                  factorization as returned by CGELQF.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     On entry, the matrix B of right hand side vectors, stored
                     columnwise; B is M-by-NRHS if TRANS = 'N', or N-by-NRHS
                     if TRANS = 'C'.
                     On exit, if INFO = 0, B is overwritten by the solution
                     vectors, stored columnwise:
                     if TRANS = 'N' and m &gt;= n, rows 1 to n of B contain the least
                     squares solution vectors; the residual sum of squares for the
                     solution in each column is given by the sum of squares of the
                     modulus of elements N+1 to M in that column;
                     if TRANS = 'N' and m &lt; n, rows 1 to N of B contain the
                     minimum norm solution vectors;
                     if TRANS = 'C' and m &gt;= n, rows 1 to M of B contain the
                     minimum norm solution vectors;
                     if TRANS = 'C' and m &lt; n, rows 1 to M of B contain the
                     least squares solution vectors; the residual sum of squares
                     for the solution in each column is given by the sum of
                     squares of the modulus of elements M+1 to N in that column.

           <u>LDB</u>

                     LDB is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array B. LDB &gt;= MAX(1,M,N).

           <u>WORK</u>

                     WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
                     On exit, if INFO = 0, <a href="../man1/WORK.1.html">WORK</a>(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

           <u>LWORK</u>

                     LWORK is INTEGER
                     The dimension of the array WORK.
                     LWORK &gt;= max( 1, MN + max( MN, NRHS ) ).
                     For optimal performance,
                     LWORK &gt;= max( 1, MN + max( MN, NRHS )*NB ).
                     where MN = min(M,N) and NB is the optimum block size.

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
                     only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
                     this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
                     message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0:  successful exit
                     &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
                     &gt; 0:  if INFO =  i, the i-th diagonal element of the
                           triangular factor of A is exactly zero, so that A does not have
                           full rank; the least squares solution could not be
                           computed.

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine

                     this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error

        <b>ZGELS</b> <b>solves</b> <b>overdetermined</b> <b>or</b> <b>underdetermined</b> <b>systems</b> <b>for</b> <b>GE</b> <b>matrices</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            ZGELS solves overdetermined or underdetermined complex linear systems
            involving an M-by-N matrix A, or its conjugate-transpose, using a QR
            or LQ factorization of A.

            It is assumed that A has full rank, and only a rudimentary protection
            against rank-deficient matrices is provided. This subroutine only detects
            exact rank-deficiency, where a diagonal element of the triangular factor
            of A is exactly zero.

            It is conceivable for one (or more) of the diagonal elements of the triangular
            factor of A to be subnormally tiny numbers without this subroutine signalling
            an error. The solutions computed for such almost-rank-deficient matrices may
            be less accurate due to a loss of numerical precision.

            The following options are provided:

            1. If TRANS = 'N' and m &gt;= n:  find the least squares solution of
               an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
                            minimize || B - A*X ||.

            2. If TRANS = 'N' and m &lt; n:  find the minimum norm solution of
               an underdetermined system A * X = B.

            3. If TRANS = 'C' and m &gt;= n:  find the minimum norm solution of
               an underdetermined system A**H * X = B.

            4. If TRANS = 'C' and m &lt; n:  find the least squares solution of
               an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
                            minimize || B - A**H * X ||.

            Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
            handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
            M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution
            matrix X.

                     least squares solution vectors; the residual sum of squares
                     for the solution in each column is given by the sum of
                     squares of the modulus of elements M+1 to N in that column.

                     LDB is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array B. LDB &gt;= MAX(1,M,N).
