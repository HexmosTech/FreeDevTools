</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Pinto::Command::pull - pull archives from upstream repositories

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.14

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         pinto --root=REPOSITORY_ROOT pull [OPTIONS] TARGET ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command locates packages in your upstream repositories and then pulls the distributions providing
       those packages into your repository and registers them on a stack.  Then it recursively locates and pulls
       all the distributions that are necessary to satisfy their prerequisites.   You can also request to
       directly pull particular distributions.

       When locating packages, Pinto first looks at the packages that already  exist in the local repository,
       then Pinto looks at the packages that are available on the upstream repositories.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments are the targets that you want to pull.  Targets can be specified as packages (with or without a
       version specification) or as distributions.  Targets can be expressed in a number of ways, so please see
       "TARGETS" below for more information.

       You can also pipe arguments to this command over STDIN.  In that case, blank lines and lines that look
       like comments (i.e. starting with "#" or ';') will be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --cascade
           !! THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL !!

           When  searching  for  a  package  (or  one of its prerequisites), always take the latest satisfactory
           version of the package found amongst <b>all</b> the upstream repositories, rather than just taking the <b>first</b>
           satisfactory version that is found.  Remember that Pinto only searches the upstream repositories when
           the local repository does not already contain a satisfactory version of the package.

       --diff-style=STYLE
           Controls the style of the diff reports.  STYLE must  be  either  "concise"  or  "detailed".   Concise
           reports  show  only  one  record  for  each distribution added or deleted.  Detailed reports show one
           record for every package added or deleted.

           The  default  style  is  "concise".   However,  the  default  style  can  changed  by   setting   the
           "PINTO_DIFF_STYLE"  environment  variable to your preferred STYLE.  This variable affects the default
           style for diff reports generated by all other commands too.

       --dry-run
           Go through all the motions, but do not actually  commit  any  changes  to  the  repository.   At  the
           conclusion,  a diff showing the changes that would have been made will be displayed.  Use this option
           to see how upgrades would potentially impact the stack.

       --no-fail
           !! THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL !!

           Normally, failure to pull a target (or its prerequisites) causes the command to immediately abort and
           rollback the changes to the repository.  But if "--no-fail" is set, then only the changes  caused  by
           the  failed  target  (and  its  prerequisites)  will  be  rolled  back  and the command will continue
           processing the remaining targets.

           This option is useful if you want to throw a list of targets into a repository and see which ones are
           problematic.  Once you've fixed the broken ones, you can throw  the  whole  list  at  the  repository
           again.

       --message=TEXT
       -m TEXT
           Use  TEXT  as  the  revision  history  log  message.  If you do not use the "--message" option or the
           "--use-default-message" option, then you will be prompted to enter the message via your text  editor.
           Use the "PINTO_EDITOR" or "EDITOR" or "VISUAL" environment variables to control which editor is used.
           A  log message is not required whenever the "--dry-run" option is set, or if the action did not yield
           any changes to the repository.

       --pin
           Pins the packages to the stack, so they cannot be changed until you unpin them.  Only the packages in
           the requested targets will be pinned -- packages in prerequisites will not be pinned.   However,  you
           may pin them separately with the pin command if you so desire.

       --recurse
       --no-recurse
           Recursively  pull  any  distributions required to satisfy prerequisites for the targets.  The default
           value for this option can be configured in the <u>pinto.ini</u> configuration file for the repository (it is
           usually set to 1).  To disable recursion, use "--no-recurse".

       --skip-missing-prerequisite=PACKAGE
       -k PACKAGE
           !! THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL !!

           Skip any prerequisite with name PACKAGE if a  satisfactory  version  cannot  be  found.   However,  a
           warning  will  be given whenever this occurrs.  This option only has effect when recursively fetching
           prerequisites for the targets (See also the "--recurse" option). This option can be repeated.

       --skip-all-missing-prerequisites
       -K  !! THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL !!

           Skips all missing prerequisites if a satisfactory version cannot be found.  However, a  warning  will
           be given whenever this occurrs.  This option will silently override the "--skip-missing-prerequisite"
           option  and  only  has  effect  when recursively fetching prerequisites for the targets (See also the
           "--recurse" option).

       --stack=NAME
       -s NAME
           Puts all the packages onto the stack with the given NAME.  Defaults to the name of whichever stack is
           currently marked as the default stack.  Use the stacks command to see the stacks in the repository.

       --use-default-message
       -M  Use the default value for the revision history log message.  Pinto will generate  a  semi-informative
           log  message  just  based  on  the  command  and  its arguments.  If you set an explicit message with
           "--message", the "--use- default-message" option will be silently ignored.

       --with-development-prerequisites
       --wd
           Also  pull  development  prerequisites  so  you'll  have  everything  you  need  to  work  on   those
           distributions,  in  the  event  that  you  need  to  patch  them  in  the future.  Be aware that most
           distributions do not actually declare their development prerequisites.

</pre><h4><b>TARGETS</b></h4><pre>
       Targets are a compact notation that identifies the things you want to pull into your repository.  Targets
       come in two flavors: package targets and distribution targets.

   <b>Package</b> <b>Targets</b>
       A package target consists of a package name and (optionally) a  version  specification.   Here  are  some
       examples:

         Foo::Bar                                 # Any version of Foo::Bar
         Foo::Bar~1.2                             # Foo::Bar version 1.2 or higher
         Foo::Bar==1.2                            # Only version 1.2 of Foo::Bar
         Foo::Bar&lt;1,2!=1.3,&lt;=1.9                  # Complex version range

       Package  names  are  case-sensitive,  and  the  version  specification  must  follow  the  format used by
       CPAN::Meta::Requirements.  All  whitespace  within  the  target  will  be  discarded.   If  your  version
       specification contains any special shell characters, take care to quote or escape them in your command.

       In  all  cases,  pinto queries the local repository and then each upstream repository in order, and pulls
       the first distribution it can find that provides a package which satisfies the version specification.

   <b>Distribution</b> <b>Targets</b>
       A distribution target consists of an author ID, zero or more subdirectories, and  the  distribution  name
       and  version  number.    This  corresponds to the actual path where the distribution archive lives in the
       repository or CPAN mirror.  Here are some examples.

         SHAKESPEARE/King-Lear-1.2.tar.gz         # A specific distribution
         SHAKESPEARE/tragedies/Hamlet-4.2.tar.gz  # Same, but with a subdirectory

       The author ID will always be forced to uppercase, but the reset of the path is case-sensitive.

   <b>Caveats</b>
       PAUSE &lt;<a href="http://pause.perl.org">http://pause.perl.org</a>&gt; has no strict rules on how packages are versioned.  It is quite  common  to
       see a package with the same verison number (or no version at all) in many releases of a distribution.  So
       when  you  specify a package target with a precise version or version range, what you actually get is the
       latest distribution (chronologically) that has a package which satisfies the target.  Most  of  the  time
       this  works  out  fine  because  you usally pull the "main module" of the distribution and authors always
       increment that version in each release.

       Since most CPAN mirrors only report the latest version of a package they have, they often cannot  satisfy
       package    targets   that   have   a   precise   version   specification.    However,   the   mirror   at
       &lt;<a href="http://cpan.stratopan.com">http://cpan.stratopan.com</a>&gt; is special and can locate a precise version of any package.

       Package targets always resolve to production releases, unless you specify  a  precise  developer  release
       version  (e.g.  "Foo::Bar==1.03_01").   But since most CPAN mirrors do not index developer releases, this
       only works when using the mirror  at  &lt;<a href="http://cpan.stratopan.com">http://cpan.stratopan.com</a>&gt;.   However,  you  can  usually  pull  a
       developer  release  from any mirror by using a distribution target.  Remember that developer releases are
       those with an underscore in the version number.

       For  repositories  created  with  Pinto  version  0.098  or  later,  the   first   upstream   source   is
       "<a href="http://cpan.stratopan.com">http://cpan.stratopan.com</a>"  (unless  you  configure  it otherwise).  For repositories created with older
       versions,  you  can  manually  add  "<a href="http://cpan.stratopan.com">http://cpan.stratopan.com</a>"  to  the  "sources"  parameter   in   the
       configuration file located at <u>.pinto/config/pinto.ini</u> within the repository.
