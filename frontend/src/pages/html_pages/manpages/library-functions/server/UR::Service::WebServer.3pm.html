</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       UR::Service::WebServer - A PSGI-based web server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $s = UR::Service::WebServer(port =&gt; 4321);
         $s-&gt;run( \&amp;handle_request );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Implements a simple, standalone web server based on HTTP::Server::PSGI.  The event loop is entered by
       calling the <b>run()</b> method.

   <b>Properties</b>
       host
           The  IP address to listen on for connections.  The default value is 'localhost'.  host can be changed
           any time before the server is created, usually the first time <b>run()</b> is called.

       port
           The TCP port to listen on for connections.   The detault value is undef, meaning that the system will
           pick an unused port.  port can be changed any time before the server is created,  usually  the  first
           time <b>run()</b> is called.

       server
           Holds  a  reference to an object that isa HTTP::Server::PSGI.  This will be automatically created the
           first time <b>run()</b> is called.

       cb  Holds a CODE reference used as the default request handler within <b>run()</b>.

   <b>Methods</b>
       $self-&gt;<b>announce()</b>
           This method is called when the PSGI server is ready to accept requests.  The base-class  behavior  is
           to print the listening URL on STDOUT.  Subclasses can override it to implement their own behavior.

       my $code = $self-&gt;file_handler_for_directory($path)
           A  helper method used for implementing server for files located in the directory $path.  It returns a
           CODE ref that takes 2 arguments, $env (the standard PSGI env hashref) and $pathname (a path  relative
           to $path).  It returns the standard tuple a PSGI server expects.

           $pathname  is  pre-processed by removing all occurrences of ".." to keep requests within the provided
           $path.  If the requested file is not found, then it returns a 404.

       $self-&gt;run(&lt;$cb&gt;)
           Enter the request loop.  If a callback is not provided to <b>run()</b>, then the  object's  cb  property  is
           used instead.  If neither have a value, then <b>run()</b> returns immediately.

           For each request $cb is called with one argument, the standard PSGI env hashref.
