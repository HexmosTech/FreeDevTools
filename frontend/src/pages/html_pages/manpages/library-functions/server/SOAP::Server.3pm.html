       SOAP::Server - provides the basic framework for the transport-specific server classes to build upon

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The SOAP::Server class provides the basic framework for the transport-specific server classes to build
       upon. Note that in none of the code examples provided with SOAP::Lite is this class used directly.
       Instead, it is designed to be a superclass within more specific implementation classes. The methods
       provided by SOAP::Server itself are:

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new(optional key/value pairs)
               $server = SOAP::Server-&gt;new(%options);

           Creates  a  new object of the class. Various default instance values are set up, and like many of the
           constructors in this module, most  of  the  class  methods  described  here  may  be  passed  in  the
           construction  call  by  giving the name followed by the parameter (or an array reference if there are
           multiple parameters).

       action(optional new value)
               $action = $server-&gt;action

           Retrieves or sets the value of the action attribute on the server object. This attribute is used when
           mapping the request to an appropriate namespace or routine. For example, the HTTP  library  sets  the
           attribute  to  the  value of the SOAPAction header when processing of the request begins, so that the
           find_target method described  later  may  retrieve  the  value  to  match  it  against  the  server's
           configuration. Returns the object itself when setting the attribute.

       myuri(optional new value)
               $server-&gt;myuri("<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:9000/SOAP");

           Gets  or  sets  the  myuri  attribute.  This  specifies the specific URI that the server is answering
           requests to (which may be different from the value specified in action or in the SOAPAction header).

       serializer(optional new value)
       deserializer(optional new value)
               $serializer = $server-&gt;serializer;
               $server-&gt;deserializer($new_deser_obj);

           As  with  the  client  objects,  these  methods  provide  direct  access  to  the  serialization  and
           deserialization  objects  the server object uses to transform input and output from and to XML. There
           is generally little or no need to explicitly set these to new values.

       options(optional new value)
               $server-&gt;options({compress_threshold =&gt; 10000});

           Sets (or retrieves) the current server options as a  hash-table   reference.  At  present,  only  one
           option is used within the SOAP::Lite libraries themselves:

           compress_threshold
               The  value  of this option is expected to be a numerical value. If set, and if the Compress::Zlib
               library is available to use, messages whose size in bytes exceeds this value are  compressed  for
               transmission. Both ends of the conversation have to support this and have it enabled.

           Other  options  may  be defined and passed around using this mechanism. Note that setting the options
           using this accessor requires a full hash reference be passed. To  set  just  one  or  a  few  values,
           retrieve the current reference value and use it to set the key(s).

       dispatch_with(optional new value)
               $server-&gt;dispatch_with($new_table);

           Represents  one  of  two  ways  in  which  a SOAP::Server (or derived) object may specify mappings of
           incoming requests to server-side subroutines or namespaces. The value of the  attribute  is  a  hash-
           table  reference. To set the attribute, you must pass a new hash reference. The hash table's keys are
           URI strings (literal URIs or the potential values of the SOAPAction header),  and  the  corresponding
           values  are  one of a class name or an object reference. Requests that come in for a URI found in the
           table are routed to the specified class or through the specified object.

       dispatch_to(optional list of new values)
               $server-&gt;dispatch_to($dir, 'Module', 'Mod::meth');

           This is the more traditional way to specify modules and packages for routing requests. This  is  also
           an  accessor,  but  it  returns  a list of values when called with no arguments (rather than a single
           one). Each item in the list of values passed to this method is expected to be one of four things:

           <u>Directory</u> <u>path</u>
               If the value is a directory path, all modules located in that path are available for remote use.

           <u>Package</u> <u>name</u>
               When the value is a package name (without including a specific method name), all routines  within
               the package are available remotely.

           <u>Fully</u> <u>qualified</u> <u>method</u> <u>name</u>
               Alternately,  when the value is a package-qualified name of a subroutine or method, that specific
               routine is made available. This allows the server to  make  selected  methods  available  without
               opening the entire package.

           <u>Object</u> <u>reference</u>
               If the value is an object reference, the object itself routes the request.

               The  list  of  values held by the dispatch_to table are compared only after the URI mapping table
               from the dispatch_with attribute has been consulted. If the request's URI  or  SOAPAction  header
               don't  map  to  a specific configuration, the path specified by the action header (or in absence,
               the URI) is converted to a package name and compared against this set of values.

       objects_by_reference(optional list of new values)
               $server-&gt;objects_by_reference(qw(My:: Class));

           This also returns a list of values when retrieving the current  attribute  value,  as  opposed  to  a
           single value.

           This  method doesn't directly specify classes for request routing so much as it modifies the behavior
           of the routing for the specified classes. The classes that are given as arguments to this method  are
           marked  to  be  treated as producing persistent objects. The client is given an object representation
           that contains just a handle on a local object with a default persistence of 600 idle  seconds.   Each
           operation  on  the  object resets the idle timer to zero. This facility is considered experimental in
           the current version of SOAP::Lite.

           A global variable/"constant" allows developers to specify the  amount  of  time  an  object  will  be
           persisted. The default value is 600 idle seconds. This value can be changed using the following code:

             $SOAP::Constants::OBJS_BY_REF_KEEPALIVE = 1000;

       on_action(optional new value)
               $server-&gt;on_action(sub { ...new code });

           Gets  or  sets the reference to a subroutine that is used for executing the on_action hook. Where the
           client code uses this hook to construct the action-request data (such as for  a  SOAPAction  header),
           the  server uses the on_action hook to do any last-minute tests on the request itself, before it gets
           routed to a final destination. When called, the hook routine is passed three arguments:

           action
               The action URI itself, retrieved from the action method described earlier.

           method_uri
               The URI of the XML namespace the method name is labeled with.

           method_name
               The name of the method being called by the request.

       on_dispatch(optional new value)
               ($uri, $name) = $server-&gt;on_dispatch-&gt;($request);

           Gets or sets the subroutine reference used for the on_dispatch hook. This hook is called at the start
           of the request-routing phase and is given a single argument when called:

           request
               An object of the SOAP::SOM class, containing the deserialized request from the client.

       find_target
               ($class, $uri, $name) = $server-&gt;find_target($req)

           Taking as its argument an object of the SOAP::SOM class that contains the deserialized request,  this
           method returns a three-element list describing the method that is to be called. The elements are:

           class
               The  class into which the method call should be made. This may come back as either a string or an
               objectreference, if the dispatching is configured using an object instance.

           uri The URN associated with the request method. This is the value that was used when configuring  the
               method routing on the server object.

           name
               The name of the method to call.

       handle
               $server-&gt;handle($request_text);

           Implements  the  main  functionality  of  the  serving process, in which the server takes an incoming
           request and dispatches it to the correct server-side subroutine. The  parameter  taken  as  input  is
           either plain XML or MIME-encoded content (if MIME-encoding support is enabled).

       make_fault
               return $server-&gt;makefault($code, $message);

           Creates  a  SOAP::Fault  object  from  the  data passed in. The order of arguments is: code, message,
           detail, actor. The first two are required (because they must be present in all faults), but the  last
           two may be omitted unless needed.

   <b>SOAP::Server::Parameters</b>
       This  class  provides two methods, but the primary purpose from the developer's point of view is to allow
       classes  that  a  SOAP  server  exposes  to  inherit  from  it.  When   a   class   inherits   from   the
       SOAP::Server::Parameters  class,  the  list  of  parameters  passed  to  a  called  method  includes  the
       deserialized request in the form of a SOAP::SOM object. This parameter  is  passed  at  the  end  of  the
       arguments list, giving methods the option of ignoring it unless it is needed.

       The  class  provides  two subroutines (not methods), for retrieving parameters from the SOAP::SOM object.
       These are designed to be called without an object reference in the parameter  list,  but  with  an  array
       reference  instead  (as  the  first parameter). The remainder of the arguments list is expected to be the
       list from the method-call itself, including the SOAP::SOM object at the end of the list. The routines may
       be useful to understand if an application wishes to subclass SOAP::Server::Parameters  and  inherit  from
       the new class instead.

       byNameOrOrder(order, parameter list, envelope)
               @args = SOAP::Server::Parameters::byNameOrOrder ([qw(a b)], @_);

           Using  the  list of argument names passed in the initial argument as an array reference, this routine
           returns a list of the parameter values for the parameters matching those names,  in  that  order.  If
           none  of  the  names given in the initial array-reference exist in the parameter list, the values are
           returned in the order in which they already appear within the list of parameters. In this  case,  the
           number of returned values may differ from the length of the requested-parameters list.

       byName(order, parameter list, envelope)
               @args = SOAP::Server::Parameters::byName ([qw(a b c)], @_);

           Acts  in  a similar manner to the previous, with the difference that it always returns as many values
           as requested, even if some (or all) don't exist. Parameters that don't exist in  the  parameter  list
           are returned as undef values.

       <u>EXAMPLE</u>

       The  following  is  an  example  CGI based Web Service that utilizes a Perl module that inherits from the
       "SOAP::Server::Parameters" class. This allows the methods of that class to access its input by name.

           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>
           use SOAP::Transport::HTTP;
           SOAP::Transport::HTTP::CGI
             -&gt;dispatch_to('C2FService')
             -&gt;handle;
           BEGIN {
             package C2FService;
             use vars qw(@ISA);
             @ISA = qw(Exporter SOAP::Server::Parameters);
             use SOAP::Lite;
             sub c2f {
               my $self = shift;
               my $envelope = pop;
               my $temp = $envelope-&gt;dataof("//c2f/temperature");
               return SOAP::Data-&gt;name('convertedTemp' =&gt; (((9/5)*($temp-&gt;value)) + 32));
             }
           }
