       Atompub::Server - A server for the Atom Publishing Protocol

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package My::Server;
           use base qw(Atompub::Server);

           sub handle_request {
               my($server) = @_;

               ...
           }

           sub password_for_user {
               my($server, $username) = @_;
               $Passwords{$username};
           }

           sub new_post {
               my($server) = @_;
               my $entry = $server-&gt;atom_body or return;
               # $entry is an XML::Atom::Entry object.
               # ... Save the new entry ...
           }

           my $server = My::Server-&gt;new;
           $server-&gt;run;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Atompub::Server provides a base class for Atom Publishing Protocol servers.  It handles all core server
       processing, and Basic and WSSE authentication.  It can also run as either a mod_perl handler or as part
       of a CGI program.

       It does not provide functions specific to any particular implementation, such as creating an entry,
       retrieving a list of entries, deleting an entry, etc.  Implementations should subclass Atompub::Server,
       overriding the "handle_request" method, and handle all functions such as this themselves.

       Atompub::Server extends XML::Atom::Server, and basically provides same functions.  However, this module
       has been fixed based on the Atom Publishing Protocol described at &lt;<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5023.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5023.txt</a>&gt;,
       and supports Basic authentication rather than WSSE.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCLASSING</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Request</b> <b>Handling</b>
       Subclasses of Atompub::Server must override the "handle_request" method to perform all request
       processing.  The implementation must set all response headers, including the response code and any
       relevant HTTP headers, and should return a scalar representing the response body to be sent back to the
       client.

       For example:

           sub handle_request {
               my($server) = @_;
               my $method = $server-&gt;request_method;
               if ($method eq 'POST') {
                   return $server-&gt;new_post;
               }
               # ... handle GET, PUT, etc
           }

           sub new_post {
               my($server) = @_;
               my $entry = $server-&gt;atom_body or return;

               # Implementation-specific
               my $id = save_this_entry($entry);
               my $location = join '/', $server-&gt;uri, $id;
               my $etag = calc_etag($entry);

               $server-&gt;response_header(Location =&gt; $location);
               $server-&gt;response_header(ETag     =&gt; $etag    );
               $server-&gt;response_code(RC_CREATED);
               $server-&gt;response_content_type('application/atom+xml;type=entry');

               # Implementation-specific
               return serialize_entry($entry);
           }

   <b>Authentication</b>
       Servers that require authentication should override the "password_for_user" method.  Given a username
       (from the Authorization or WSSE header), "password_for_user" should return that user's password in
       plaintext.  If the supplied username doesn't exist in your user database or alike, just return "undef".

       For example:

           my %Passwords = (foo =&gt; 'bar');   # The password for "foo" is "bar".
           sub password_for_user {
               my($server, $username) = @_;
               $Passwords{$username};
           }

       • Basic Authentication

         <u>realm</u> must be assigned before authentication for Basic authentication.

             $server-&gt;realm('MySite');

         If  your  server  runs  as  a  CGI  program  and  authenticates  by  Basic authenticate, you should use
         authentication mechanism of the http server, like ".htaccess".

       • WSSE Authentication

         Any pre-configuration is not required for WSSE.  The password returned from "password_for_user" will be
         combined with the nonce and the creation time to generate the digest, which will be compared  with  the
         digest sent in the WSSE header.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Atompub::Server  provides  a variety of methods to be used by subclasses for retrieving headers, content,
       and other request information, and for setting the same on the response.

   <b>$server-&gt;realm</b>
       If called with an argument, sets the <u>realm</u> for Basic authentication.

       Returns the current <u>realm</u> that will be used when receiving requests.

   <b>$server-&gt;send_http_header($content_type)</b>
   <b>$server-&gt;get_auth_info</b>
   <b>$server-&gt;authenticate</b>
   <b>$server-&gt;auth_failure($status,</b> <b>$message)</b>
   <b>oether</b> <b>methods</b>
       Descriptions are found in XML::Atom::Server.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Once you have defined your server subclass, you can set it up either as a CGI program or  as  a  mod_perl
       handler.

       See XML::Atom::Server in details.
