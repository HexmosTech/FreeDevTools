</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::HTTP::Server::Simple - Test::More functions for HTTP::Server::Simple

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package My::WebServer;
           use base qw/Test::HTTP::Server::Simple HTTP::Server::Simple/;

           package main;
           use Test::More tests =&gt; 42;

           my $s = My::WebServer-&gt;new;

           my $url_root = $s-&gt;started_ok("start up my web server);

           # connect to "$url_root/cool/site" and test with Test::WWW::Mechanize,
           # Test::HTML::Tidy, etc

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This mixin class provides methods to test an HTTP::Server::Simple-based web server.  Currently, it
       provides only one such method: "started_ok".

   <b>started_ok</b> <b>[$text]</b>
       "started_ok" takes an optional test description.  The server needs to have been configured (specifically,
       its port needs to have been set), but it should not have been run or backgrounded.  "started_ok" calls
       "background" on the server, which forks it to run in the background.  Test::HTTP::Server::Simple takes
       care of killing the server when your test script dies, even if you kill your test script with an
       interrupt.  "started_ok" returns the URL "<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:$port" which you can use to connect to your
       server.

       Note that if the child process dies, or never gets around to listening for connections, this just hangs.
       (This may be fixed in a future version.)

       Also, it probably won't work if you use a custom Net::Server in your server.

   <b>pids</b>
       Returns the PIDs of the processes which have been started.  Since multiple test servers can be running at
       one, be aware that this returns a list.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Builder, HTTP::Server::Simple, NEXT.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Installs an interrupt signal handler, which may override any that another part of your program has
       installed.
