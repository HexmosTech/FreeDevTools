</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Crypt::U2F::Server::Simple - Register and Authenticate U2F compatible security devices

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Crypt::U2F::Server:Simple;

         my $crypter = Crypt::U2F::Server::Simple-&gt;new(
             appId  =&gt; 'Perl',
             origin =&gt; '<a href="http://search.cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org</a>'
         );

         # Generate a registration request
         my $registerRequest = $crypter-&gt;registrationChallenge();

         # Give $registerRequest to client, receive $registrationData from client
         # NB: if Crypt::U2F::Server::Simple has been recreated (web process for example), challenge
         #     value must be restored (value only, not JSON blob):
         #$crypter-&gt;setChallenge($challenge)
         my ($keyHandle, $userKey) = $crypter-&gt;registrationVerify($registrationData)

         # Generate an authentication request (using the previously generated key handle and user key)
         my $authrequest = $crypter-&gt;authenticationChallenge();

         # Send $authrequest to client, receive $authSignature
         # NB: if Crypt::U2F::Server::Simple has been recreated (web process for example), challenge
         #     value must be restored (value only, not JSON blob):
         #$crypter-&gt;setChallenge($challenge)
         my $authok = $crypter-&gt;authenticationVerify($authSignature);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements the server side of U2F authentication through Yubico's C library.

       Both registration and authentication are two step processes that each must be run in the same instance of
       this perl module. To clarify You can run registration from another instance than authentication, or even
       in another program on another server. But, as far as it is currently implemented, you must run both
       registration steps in the same instance of this module, the same goes for authentication. Needs more
       testing, really.

       A successful registration of a key yields to two scalars, a key handle and a public key. It is <b>your</b>
       responsibility to keep them safe somewhere and reload them into this module whenever you want to do
       authentication.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       This module requires the Yubico u2f-server shared library installed, please see the official project page
       at &lt;https://developers.yubico.com/libu2f-server/&gt; on how to do that.

</pre><h4><b>NO</b> <b>MULTITHREADING</b></h4><pre>
       The way this is currently implemented, i doubt very much that multithreadingm will work.  Multi-Forking
       should be OK as long as you only call <b>new()</b> <b>after</b> forking, though. Also using more than one instance of
       this module in your program. This isn't really tested at the moment, though...

</pre><h4><b>ALPHA</b> <b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       As already stated above, at this time Crypt::U2F::Server and Crypt::U2F::Server::Simple have seen only
       very limited testing and the modules are still subject to change.

       That isn't to say that you shouldn't use this at all. Rather, if you are interested, you should test this
       a lot and report any bugs you find!

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTION</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>lastError()</b>
       Probably the most important function of all, therefore mention first. If something goes wrong (but not
       HorriblyWrong[tm]), you'll get the last error description of whatever happened.

       If something fails during <b>new()</b>, call it with the full name:

           my $oooops = Crypt::U2F::Server::Simple::lastError();

       If you already got an instance, you can use that as well:

           my $oooops = $auth-&gt;lastError();

       Errors are global over all instances of this module.

       If things go HorriblyWrong[tm], your program might crash. Or get remote-buffer-overflow-exploited or
       something. In these case, <b>lastError()</b> might not work reliably. You know, just the usual crypto stuff...

   <b>new()</b>
       This comes in two forms, depending if you do authentication in the same instance as the registration
       steps.

       The simple form (only registration or registration+authentication) only requires the arguments appId and
       origin:

           my $auth = Crypt::U2F::Server::Simple-&gt;new(
               appId  =&gt; 'Perl',
               origin =&gt; '<a href="http://search.cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org</a>'
           );

       If you only do authentication, you have to supply the keyHandle and publicKey data as well:

           my $auth = Crypt::U2F::Server::Simple-&gt;new(
               appId     =&gt; 'Perl',
               origin    =&gt; '<a href="http://search.cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org</a>',
               keyHandle =&gt; $keyHandleData
               publicKey =&gt; $publicKeyData
           );

       For security, i would recommend creating a new instance for each and every authentication request.

       If something goes wrong during initialization, $auth will be <u>undef</u>.

       To enable Yubico library debug, set debug to 1:

           my $auth = Crypt::U2F::Server::Simple-&gt;new(
               appId  =&gt; 'Perl',
               origin =&gt; '<a href="http://search.cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org</a>',
               debug  =&gt; 1
           );

   <b>registrationChallenge()</b>
           my $challenge = $auth-&gt;registrationChallenge();

       Gives you a unique registration challenge on every call. This is a JSON string and should be send to the
       client (called a "host" for whatever reason) as is.

       If something goes wrong, $challenge will be <u>undef</u>.

       $challenge is a JSON blob that contains a hash. Here are the main keys

       version: the protocol version
       appId: the appId given in <b>new()</b>
       challenge: the challenge value

   <b>registrationVerify()</b>
           my ($keyHandle, $publicKey) = $auth-&gt;registrationVerify($reply);

       If the client (the "host") accepts the challenge, it will send you another JSON blob ($reply).

       If  everything  goes  well and registration succeeds, you will get the key handle and public key of, well
       client key. If it fails, you will get <u>undef</u>.

       $keyHandle and $publicKey will get set  internally  for  direct  following  authentication  in  the  same
       instance, you need to store it in some persistent way yourself for future authentication.

       As  an  added  bonus,  $publicKey  will be a binary blob, so you may have to convert it to something like
       Base64 for easier handling. See MIME::Base64 on how to do that. Make sure you un-encode before loading it
       into this module!

   <b>authenticationChallenge()</b>
       This function generates an authentication challenge. To do that, it needs keyHandle and publicKey,  since
       this is key dependent.

           my $challenge = $auth-&gt;authenticationChallenge();

       Otherwise,  this  works  the  same  as  the registration challenge. You get a JSON blob, send that to the
       client and get an answer.

       The JSON blob structure is described in <b>registrationChallenge()</b> doc.

   <b>authenticationVerify()</b>
       After you get the authentication answer, you need to verify it:

           my $isValid = $auth-&gt;authenticationVerify($reply);

       $isValid is true if authentication succeedsr.  If  something  went  wrong  (library  error,  fake  user),
       $isValid is false, in which case you can look into <b>lastError()</b> to see what went wrong.

   <b>setChallenge()</b>
       If     Crypt::U2F::Server::Simple     has     been    recreated    since    <b>registrationChallenge()</b>    or
       <b>authenticationChallenge()</b> usage, challenge value must be restored:

           $auth-&gt;setChallenge($challenge)

       Note  that  $challenge  must  be  the  string   value   of   challenge,   not   the   JSON   blob.    See
       <b>registrationChallenge()</b> doc to get challenge description.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       See Crypt::U2F::Server for the low level library if you want better headaches.

       There are two examples in the tarball for registration and authentication.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Yes,  there  should  be  some in there. First of all, this is crypto stuff, so it's broken by default (it
       only depends on the time it takes to happen).

       Also, at the moment, this module has seen only very limited testing.
