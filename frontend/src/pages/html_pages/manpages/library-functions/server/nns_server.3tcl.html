</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Please read <u>Name</u> <u>service</u> <u>facility,</u> <u>introduction</u> first.

       This  package provides an implementation of the serviver side of the name service facility queried by the
       client provided by the package <b>nameserv</b>. All information required by the server will be held  in  memory.
       There is no persistent state.

       This  service  is  built  in  top  of and for the package <b>comm</b>.  It has nothing to do with the Internet's
       Domain Name System. If the reader is looking for a package dealing with that please see Tcllib's packages
       <b>dns</b> and <b>resolv</b>.

       This server supports the <u>Core</u> protocol feature, and since version 0.3 the  <u>Search/Continuous</u>  feature  as
       well.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       The package exports five commands, as specified below:

       <b>::nameserv::server::start</b>
              This command starts the server and causes it to listen on the configured port. From now on clients
              are able to connect and make requests. The result of the command is the empty string.

              Note that any incoming requests will only be handled if the application the server is part of does
              enter an event loop after this command has been run.

       <b>::nameserv::server::stop</b>
              Invoking  this  command stops the server and releases all information it had. Existing connections
              are shut down, and no new connections will be accepted any longer. The result of  the  command  is
              the empty string.

       <b>::nameserv::server::active?</b>
              This  command  returns a boolean value indicating the state of the server. The result will be <b>true</b>
              if the server is active, i.e. has been started, and <b>false</b> otherwise.

       <b>::nameserv::server::cget</b> <b>-option</b>
              This command returns the currently configured  value  for  the  specified  <b>-option</b>.  The  list  of
              supported options and their meaning can be found in section <b>OPTIONS</b>.

       <b>::nameserv::server::configure</b>
              In  this form the command returns a dictionary of all supported options, and their current values.
              The list of supported options and their meaning can be found in section <b>OPTIONS</b>.

       <b>::nameserv::server::configure</b> <b>-option</b>
              In this form the command  is  an  alias  for  "<b>::nameserv::server::cget</b>  <b>-option</b>".   The  list  of
              supported options and their meaning can be found in section <b>OPTIONS</b>.

       <b>::nameserv::server::configure</b> <b>-option</b> <u>value</u>...
              In  this  form the command is used to configure one or more of the supported options. At least one
              option has to be specified, and each option is followed by its new value.  The list  of  supported
              options and their meaning can be found in section <b>OPTIONS</b>.

              This form can be used only if the server is not active, i.e. has not been started yet, or has been
              stopped. While the server is active it cannot be reconfigured.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  options  supported by the server are for the specification of the TCP port to listen on, and whether
       to accept non-local connections or not.  They are:

       <b>-localonly</b> <u>bool</u>
              This option  specifies  whether  to  accept  only  local  connections  (-localonly  1)  or  remote
              connections as well (-localonly 0). The default is to accept only local connections.

       <b>-port</b> <u>number</u>
              This  option  specifies the port the name service will listen on after it has been started. It has
              to be a positive integer number (&gt; 0) not greater than 65536 (unsigned short). The initial default
              is the number returned by the command <b>::nameserv::server::common::port</b>, as provided by the package
              <b>::nameserv::server::common</b>.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       0.3    Extended the server with the ability to perform asynchronous and continuous searches.

       0.2    Changed name of -local switch to -localonly.

       0.1    Initial implementation of the server.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS,</b> <b>IDEAS,</b> <b>FEEDBACK</b></h4><pre>
       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain bugs and  other  problems.   Please
       report  such  in  the  category  <u>nameserv</u>  of the <u>Tcllib</u> <u>Trackers</u> [<a href="http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist">http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist</a>].
       Please also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or documentation.

       When proposing code changes, please provide <u>unified</u> <u>diffs</u>, i.e the output of <b>diff</b> <b>-u</b>.

       Note further that <u>attachments</u> are strongly preferred over inlined patches. Attachments  can  be  made  by
       going  to the <b>Edit</b> form of the ticket immediately after its creation, and then using the left-most button
       in the secondary navigation bar.
