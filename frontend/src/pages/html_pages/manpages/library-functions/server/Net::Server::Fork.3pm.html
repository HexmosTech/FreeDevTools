</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Server::Fork - Net::Server personality

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use base qw(Net::Server::Fork);

           sub process_request {
               #...code...
           }

           __PACKAGE__-&gt;run();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Please read the pod on Net::Server first.  This module is a personality, or extension, or sub class, of
       the Net::Server module.

       This personality binds to one or more ports and then waits for a client connection.  When a connection is
       received, the server forks a child.  The child handles the request and then closes.

       With the exception of parent/child signaling, this module will work (with basic functionality) on Win32
       systems.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       check_for_dead
           Number  of  seconds  to  wait before looking for dead children.  This only takes place if the maximum
           number of child processes (max_servers) has been reached.  Default is 60 seconds.

       max_servers
           The maximum number of children to fork.  The server will not accept connections until there are  free
           children. Default is 256 children.

       max_dequeue
           The  maximum  number of dequeue processes to start.  If a value of zero or undef is given, no dequeue
           processes will be started.   The  number  of  running  dequeue  processes  will  be  checked  by  the
           check_for_dead variable.

       check_for_dequeue
           Seconds  to  wait before forking off a dequeue process.  It is intended to use the dequeue process to
           take care of items such as mail queues.  If a value of undef is given, no dequeue processes  will  be
           started.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       See Net::Server.

</pre><h4><b>PROCESS</b> <b>FLOW</b></h4><pre>
       Process  flow  follows  Net::Server  until  the post_accept phase.  At this point a child is forked.  The
       parent is immediately able to wait for another request.  The child handles the request and then exits.

</pre><h4><b>HOOKS</b></h4><pre>
       The Fork server has the following hooks in addition to the hooks provided by the Net::Server base  class.
       See Net::Server

       "$self-&gt;pre_accept_hook()"
           This hook occurs just before the accept is called.

       "$self-&gt;post_accept_hook()"
           This hook occurs in the child after the accept and fork.

       "$self-&gt;run_dequeue()"
           This hook only gets called in conjunction with the check_for_dequeue setting.

</pre><h4><b>HOT</b> <b>DEPLOY</b></h4><pre>
       Since  version  2.000,  the Fork server has accepted the TTIN and TTOU signals.  When a TTIN is received,
       the max_servers is increased by 1.  If a TTOU signal is received the max_servers is decreased by 1.  This
       allows for adjusting the number of handling processes without having to restart the server.
