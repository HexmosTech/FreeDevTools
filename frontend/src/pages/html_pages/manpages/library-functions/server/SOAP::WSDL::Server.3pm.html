</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SOAP::WSDL::Server - WSDL based SOAP server base class

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Don't use directly, use the SOAP::WSDL::Server::* subclasses instead.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       SOAP::WSDL::Server basically follows the architecture sketched below (though dispatcher classes are not
       implemented yet)

        SOAP Request           SOAP Response
              |                     ^
              V                     |
         ------------------------------------------
        |       SOAP::WSDL::Server                 |
        |  --------------------------------------  |
        | | Transport Class                      | |
        | |--------------------------------------| |
        | | Deserializer       | Serializer      | |
        | |--------------------------------------| |
        | | Dispatcher                           | |
        |  --------------------------------------  |
         ------------------------------------------
             | calls                 ^
             v                       | returns
          -------------------------------------
         |   Handler                           |
          -------------------------------------

       All of the components (Transport class, deserializer, dispatcher and serializer) are implemented as
       plugins.

       The architecture is not implemented as planned yet, but the dispatcher is currently part of
       SOAP::WSDL::Server, which aggregates serializer and deserializer, and is subclassed by transport classes
       (of which SOAP::WSDL::Server::CGI is the only implemented one yet).

       The dispatcher is currently based on the SOAPAction header. This does not comply to the WS-I basic
       profile, which declares the SOAPAction as optional.

       The final dispatcher will be based on wire signatures (i.e. the classes of the deserialized messages).

       A hash-based dispatcher could be implemented by examining the top level hash keys.

</pre><h4><b>EXCEPTION</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Builtin</b> <b>exceptions</b>
       SOAP::WSDL::Server handles the following errors itself:

       In case of errors, a SOAP Fault containing an appropriate error message is returned.

       •   XML parsing errors

       •   Configuration errors

   <b>Throwing</b> <b>exceptions</b>
       The  proper  way  to throw a exception is just to die - SOAP::WSDL::Server::CGI catches the exception and
       sends a SOAP Fault back to the client.

       If  you  want  more  control  over  the  SOAP  Fault  sent  to  the  client,   you   can   die   with   a
       SOAP::WSDL::SOAP::Fault11 object - or just let the SOAP::Server's deserializer create one for you:

        my $soap = MyServer::SomeService-&gt;new();

        die $soap-&gt;get_deserializer()-&gt;generate_fault({
           code =&gt; 'SOAP-ENV:Server',
           role =&gt; 'urn:localhost',
           message =&gt; "The error message to pas back",
           detail =&gt; "Some details on the error",
        });

       You  may  use  any  other  object  as  exception,  provided it has a <b>serialize()</b> method which returns the
       object's XML representation.

   <b>Subclassing</b>
       To write a transport-specific SOAP Server, you should subclass SOAP::WSDL::Server.

       See the "SOAP::WSDL::Server::*" modules for examples.

       A SOAP Server must call the following method to actually handle the request:

       <u>handle</u>

       Handles the SOAP request.

       Returns the response message as XML.

       Expects a "HTTP::Request" object as only parameter.

       You may use any other object as parameter, as long as it implements the following methods:

       •   header

           Called as header('SOAPAction'). Must return the corresponding HTTP header.

       •   content

           Returns the request message
