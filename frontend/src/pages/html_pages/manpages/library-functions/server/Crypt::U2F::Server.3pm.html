</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Crypt::U2F::Server - Low level wrapper around the U2F two factor authentication C library (server side)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Crypt::U2F::Server;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a very low level wrapper around the original C library. You probably <b>shouldn't</b> use it, but use
       Crypt::U2F::Server::Simple instead!

       This API is subject to change, depending on the underlying library, the weather and the whims of the
       developer.

       If you decide to use it anyway, it would probably be a good idea to specify the exact version number of
       Crypt::U2F::Server to use.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       This module requires the Yubico u2f-server shared library installed, please see the official project page
       at &lt;https://developers.yubico.com/libu2f-server/&gt; on how to do that.

</pre><h4><b>NO</b> <b>MULTITHREADING</b> <b>/</b> <b>MULTI</b> <b>INSTANCES</b></h4><pre>
       The way this is currently implemented, i doubt very much that multithreading or even use in more than one
       instance in your program will work. Multi-Forking should be OK, though, if you only call <b>u2fclib_init()</b>
       after forking, but this isn't tested as of yet.

       The problem is how <b>u2fclib_init()</b> and <b>u2fclib_deInit()</b> are implemented. While the underlying library has
       a context-handle (not used here), <b>u2fclib_deInit()</b> will tear down everything as far as i can tell.

       Crypt::U2F::Server::Simple works around this problem by reference counting and always requiring all
       values to call the relevant u2fclib_set* functions.

   <b>EXPORT</b>
       None by default.

   <b>Exportable</b> <b>functions</b>
         char* u2fclib_calcRegistrationChallenge(void* ctx)
         int u2fclib_deInit(void)
         int u2fclib_free_context(void* ctx)
         char* u2fclib_getError(void)
         void* u2fclib_get_context(void)
         int u2fclib_init(bool debug)
         int u2fclib_setAppID(void* ctx, char* appid)
         int u2fclib_setChallenge(void* ctx, char* challenge)
         int u2fclib_setKeyHandle(void* ctx, char* buf)
         int u2fclib_setOrigin(void* ctx, char* origin)
         int u2fclib_setPublicKey(void* ctx, char* buf)
         int u2fclib_verifyAuthentication(void* ctx, char* buf)
         registrationData_t* u2fclib_verifyRegistration(void* ctx, char* buf)

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       See Crypt::U2F::Server::Simple for the module you should actually be using.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Yes, there should be some in there. First of all, this is crypto stuff, so it's broken by default (it
       only depends on the time it takes to happen).

       Also, at the moment, this module has seen only very limited testing.

       Adapted as a Perl library by Rene 'cavac' Schickbauer

       This      roughly      based      on      u2f-server.c      from      Yubico's     C     library,     see
       &lt;https://developers.yubico.com/libu2f-server/&gt;

       In order for this to work, you need to install that library.

       This adaption is (C) 2014-2018 Rene 'cavac' Schickbauer and 2018 Xavier Guimard, but as it  is  based  on
       Yubico's code, the licence below applies!
