</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTTP::Server::Simple::Recorder - Mixin to record HTTP::Server::Simple's sockets

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package MyServer;
           use base qw/HTTP::Server::Simple::Recorder HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI/;

           sub recorder_prefix { "path/to/logs/record" }  # defaults to /tmp/http-server-simple-recorder

           # logs to path/to/logs/record.34244.1.in,
           #         path/to/logs/record.34244.1.out,
           #         path/to/logs/record.34244.2.in,
           #         path/to/logs/record.34244.2.out, etc, if 34244 is the PID of the server

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module allows you to record all HTTP communication between an HTTP::Server::Simple-derived server
       and its clients.  It is a mixin, so it doesn't itself subclass HTTP::Server::Simple; you need to subclass
       from both HTTP::Server::Simple::Recorder and an actual HTTP::Server::Simple subclass, and
       HTTP::Server::Simple::Recorder should be listed first.

       Every time a client connects to your server, this module will open a pair of files and log the
       communication between the file and server to these files.  Each connection gets a serial number starting
       at 1.  The filename used is "&lt;$self-"recorder_prefix&gt;&gt;, then a period, then the connection serial number,
       then a period, then either "in" or "out".  "recorder_prefix" defaults to
       "/tmp/http-server-simple-recorder", but you can override that in your subclass.  For example, you might
       want to include the process ID.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
