       XChangeDeviceDontPropagateList, XGetDeviceDontPropagateList - query or change the dont-propagate-list for
       extension devices

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;

       int XChangeDeviceDontPropagateList( Display *display,
                                           Window window,
                                           int count,
                                           XEventClass *event_list,
                                           int mode);

       XEventClass* XGetDeviceDontPropagateList( Display *display,
                                                 Window window,
                                                 int *count);

       display
              Specifies the connection to the X server.

       window
              Specifies the window whose dont-propagate-list is to be
              queried or modified.

       event_list
              Specifies a pointer to a list of event classes.

       mode
              Specifies the mode. You can pass AddToList, or
              DeleteFromList.

       count
              Specifies the number of event classes in the list.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
           The XChangeDeviceDontPropagateList request modifies the list of
           events that should not be propagated to ancestors of the event
           window. This request allows extension events to be added to or
           deleted from that list. By default, all events are propagated
           to ancestor windows. Once modified, the list remains modified
           for the life of the window. Events are not removed from the
           list because the client that added them has terminated.

           Suppression of event propagation is not allowed for all input
           extension events. If a specified event class is one that cannot
           be suppressed, a BadClass error will result. Events that can be
           suppressed include DeviceKeyPress, DeviceKeyRelease,
           DeviceButtonPress, DeviceButtonRelease, DeviceMotionNotify,
           ProximityIn, and ProximityOut.

           XChangeDeviceDontPropagateList can generate a BadDevice,
           BadClass, or BadValue error.

           The XGetDeviceDontPropagateList request queries the list of
           events that should not be propagated to ancestors of the event
           window.

           XGetDeviceDontPropagateList can generate a BadClass or
           BadWindow error.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
           BadDevice
                  An invalid device was specified. The specified device
                  does not exist or has not been opened by this client via
                  XOpenInputDevice. This error may also occur if some
                  other client has caused the specified device to become
                  the X keyboard or X pointer device via the
                  XChangeKeyboardDevice or XChangePointerDevice requests.

           BadValue
                  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values
                  accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
                  specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
                  argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
                  set of alternatives can generate this error.

           BadWindow
                  An invalid window id was specified.

           BadClass
                  An invalid event class was specified.
