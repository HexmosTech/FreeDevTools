</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tk_MaintainGeometry</b>  and  <b>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</b> make it easier for geometry managers to deal with windows
       whose containers are not their parents.  Three problems arise if the container for a window  is  not  its
       parent:

       [1]    The x- and y-position of the window must be translated from the coordinate system of the container
              to that of the parent before positioning the window.

       [2]    If  the  container  window,  or any of its ancestors up to the window's parent, is moved, then the
              window must be repositioned within its parent in order to maintain the correct  position  relative
              to the container.

       [3]    If  the container or one of its ancestors is mapped or unmapped, then the window must be mapped or
              unmapped to correspond.

       None of these problems is an issue if the parent and  container  are  the  same.   For  example,  if  the
       container or one of its ancestors is unmapped, the window is automatically removed by the screen by X.

       <b>Tk_MaintainGeometry</b> deals with these problems for windows whose containers are not their parents, as well
       as  handling  the  simpler  case  of  windows  whose container are their parents.  <b>Tk_MaintainGeometry</b> is
       typically called by a window manager once it has decided where a window should be positioned relative  to
       its  container.   <b>Tk_MaintainGeometry</b>  translates  the  coordinates  to the coordinate system of <u>window</u>'s
       parent and then moves and resizes the  window  appropriately.   Furthermore,  it  remembers  the  desired
       position  and  creates  event  handlers  to monitor the container and all of its ancestors up to (but not
       including) the window's parent.  If any of these windows is moved, mapped, or unmapped, the  window  will
       be  adjusted  so  that  it  is  mapped only when the container is mapped and its geometry relative to the
       container remains as specified by <u>x</u>, <u>y</u>, <u>width</u>, and <u>height</u>.

       When a window manager relinquishes control over a window, or if it decides that  it  does  not  want  the
       window   to   appear   on   the   screen   under   any   conditions,   it   calls  <b>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</b>.
       <b>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</b> unmaps the window and cancels any previous calls  to  <b>Tk_MaintainGeometry</b>  for  the
       <u>container</u>-<u>window</u>  pair,  so  that  the  window's  geometry  and  mapped  state  are  no longer maintained
       automatically.  <b>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</b> need not be called  by  a  geometry  manager  if  the  window,  the
       container, or any of the container's ancestors is destroyed:  Tk will call it automatically.

       If  <b>Tk_MaintainGeometry</b> is called repeatedly for the same <u>container</u>-<u>window</u> pair, the information from the
       most  recent  call  supersedes  any  older  information.   If  <b>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</b>  is  called  for   a
       <u>container</u>-<u>window</u> pair that is is not currently managed, the call has no effect.
