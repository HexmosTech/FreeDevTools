       wm - Communicate with window manager

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wm</b> <u>option</u> <u>window</u> ?<u>args</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>wm</b> command is used to interact with window managers in order to control such things as the title for
       a window, its geometry, or the increments in terms of which it may be resized.  The <b>wm</b> command  can  take
       any  of  a number of different forms, depending on the <u>option</u> argument.  All of the forms expect at least
       one additional argument, <u>window</u>, which must be the path name of a top-level window.

       The legal forms for the <b>wm</b> command are:

       <b>wm</b> <b>aspect</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>minNumer</u> <u>minDenom</u> <u>maxNumer</u> <u>maxDenom</u>?
              If <u>minNumer</u>, <u>minDenom</u>, <u>maxNumer</u>, and <u>maxDenom</u> are all specified, then they will be passed  to  the
              window  manager  and  the  window  manager should use them to enforce a range of acceptable aspect
              ratios for <u>window</u>.  The aspect ratio of <u>window</u> (width/length) will be constrained to  lie  between
              <u>minNumer</u>/<u>minDenom</u>  and  <u>maxNumer</u>/<u>maxDenom</u>.   If  <u>minNumer</u> etc. are all specified as empty strings,
              then any existing aspect ratio restrictions are removed.  If <u>minNumer</u> etc. are specified, then the
              command returns an empty string.  Otherwise, it returns a Tcl list containing four elements, which
              are the current values of <u>minNumer</u>, <u>minDenom</u>, <u>maxNumer</u>, and <u>maxDenom</u> (if  no  aspect  restrictions
              are in effect, then an empty string is returned).

       <b>wm</b> <b>attributes</b> <u>window</u>

       <b>wm</b> <b>attributes</b> <u>window</u> ?<b>option</b>?

       <b>wm</b> <b>attributes</b> <u>window</u> ?<b>option</b> <b>value</b> <b>option</b> <b>value...</b>?
              This  subcommand  returns or sets platform specific attributes associated with a window. The first
              form returns a list of the platform specific flags and their values. The second form  returns  the
              value  for  the  specific option. The third form sets one or more of the values. The values are as
              follows:

              All platforms support the following attributes (though X11 users should see the notes below):

              <b>-alpha</b> Specifies the alpha transparency level of the toplevel. It accepts a value from <b>0.0</b>  (fully
                     transparent)  to  <b>1.0</b>  (opaque).  Values outside that range will be constrained.  Where not
                     supported, the <b>-alpha</b> value remains at <b>1.0</b>.

              <b>-fullscreen</b>
                     Places the window in a mode that takes up the entire screen, has no borders, and covers the
                     general use area (i.e. Start menu and taskbar  on  Windows,  dock  and  menubar  on  macOS,
                     general window decorations on X11).

              <b>-topmost</b>
                     Specifies whether this is a topmost window (displays above all other windows).

              On Windows, the following attributes may be set.

              <b>-disabled</b>
                     Specifies whether the window is in a disabled state.

              <b>-toolwindow</b>
                     Specifies a toolwindow style window (as defined in the MSDN).

              <b>-transparentcolor</b>
                     Specifies  the  transparent color index of the toplevel.  It takes any color value accepted
                     by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.  If the empty string is specified (default), no transparent color is  used.
                     This  is  supported  on Windows 2000/XP+.  Where not supported, the <b>-transparentcolor</b> value
                     remains at <b>{}</b>.

              On macOS, the following attributes may be set.

              <b>-appearance</b>
                     Specifies whether the window is rendered in "dark mode".  Allowed values are <b>auto</b>, <b>aqua</b> and
                     <b>darkaqua</b>.  If the setting is auto then the appearance of the window is  controlled  by  the
                     System Settings.

              <b>-class</b> Specifies  whether  the  underlying Aqua window for a toplevel is an object of the NSWindow
                     class or the NSPanel class.  The two allowed  values  for  this  option  are  <b>nswindow</b>  and
                     <b>nspanel</b>.   It  is  not possible to change the class of the underlying Aqua window once that
                     window has been instantiated, and attempting to do that is an error.  However it is allowed
                     to set this option for a pathname that does not correspond to an  existing  window.   Doing
                     that  causes the class name to be cached for later use.  When a toplevel with that pathname
                     is eventually created, the cached class name will determine which class  is  used  for  the
                     underlying Aqua window.

              <b>-isdark</b>
                     Returns a boolean value which is true if the window is currently in dark mode.

              <b>-modified</b>
                     Specifies  the modification state of the window (determines whether the window close widget
                     contains the modification indicator and whether the proxy icon is draggable).

              <b>-notify</b>
                     Specifies process notification state (bouncing of the application dock icon).

              <b>-stylemask</b>
                     Specifies an integer to be assigned as the styleMask of the underlying Aqua  window.   (See
                     the  Apple  documentation  for styleMask property of the NSWindow class.) The value of this
                     option should be a list of bitnames.  Each bit named in the list will be set to 1, and  all
                     other  bits  will be set to 0.  The allowed bitnames are: <b>titled</b>, <b>closable</b>, <b>miniaturizable</b>,
                     <b>resizable</b>, <b>fullsizecontentview</b>, <b>docmodal</b>, <b>utility</b>, <b>nonactivatingpanel</b>, and <b>HUDwindow</b>.  Note
                     that a side effect of setting the fullsizecontentview bit is  that  the  window  title  bar
                     becomes transparent.

              <b>-tabbingid</b>
                     Controls how tabbed toplevel windows are grouped together.  Two tabs in the same group must
                     correspond to toplevels with the same tabbingid, which can be an arbitrary UTF8 string.  In
                     the Tk implementation, changing the tabbingid of a toplevel in a tab group will cause it to
                     be  moved  into  a different group, in which all tabs have the new tabbingid or, if the new
                     tabbingid is unique, to become a normal non-tabbed toplevel.   It is  allowed  to  set  the
                     tabbingid before the toplevel is created.  If the pathname provided in the command does not
                     correspond  to  a  toplevel,  the  value will be cached and used later when the toplevel is
                     actually created.

              <b>-tabbingmode</b>
                     Controls whether a toplevel can be opened as a tab within a tab group.  The allowed  values
                     are  <b>auto</b>,  <b>preferred</b>  or  <b>disallowed</b>.   A  toplevel  can be opened as a tab in exactly two
                     situations: if its tabbingmode is <b>preferred</b>; or if its tabbingmode is <b>auto</b> and the user has
                     selected "prefer tabs when opening documents" in the Desktop and Dock panel of  the  System
                     Settings application.  It is allowed to set the tabbingmode before the toplevel is created.
                     If  the  pathname provided in the command does not correspond to a toplevel, the value will
                     be cached and used later when the toplevel is actually created.

              <b>-titlepath</b>
                     Specifies the path of the file referenced as the window proxy icon (which  can  be  dragged
                     and dropped in lieu of the file's finder icon).

              <b>-transparent</b>
                     Makes  the  window  content  area  transparent  and  turns  off  the window shadow. For the
                     transparency to be effective, the toplevel background needs to be set to a color with  some
                     alpha, e.g.  “systemTransparent”.

              On  X11,  the following attributes may be set. These are not supported by all window managers, and
              will have no effect under older WMs.

              <b>-type</b>  Requests that the window should be interpreted by  the  window  manager  as  being  of  the 2
                     specified  type(s).  This  may  cause  the  window  to  be  decorated in a different way or 2
                     otherwise managed differently, though exactly what happens is entirely  up  to  the  window 2
                     manager.  A  list  of  types  may be used, in order of preference. The following values are 2
                     mapped to constants defined in the EWMH specification (using others is  possible,  but  not 2
                     advised):                                                                                   2

                     <b>desktop</b>                                                                                     2
                            indicates a desktop feature,                                                         2

                     <b>dock</b>                                                                                        2
                            indicates a dock/panel feature,                                                      2

                     <b>notification</b>                                                                                2
                            indicates a window that provides a background  notification  of  some  event,  which 2
                            should usually also be set to be override-redirected (with <b>wm</b> <b>overrideredirect</b>),     2

                     <b>combo</b>                                                                                       2
                            indicates  the drop-down list of a combobox widget, which should usually also be set 2
                            to be override-redirected (with <b>wm</b> <b>overrideredirect</b>),                                2

                            indicates a window that represents something being  dragged,  which  should  usually 2
                            also be set to be override-redirected (with <b>wm</b> <b>overrideredirect</b>),                    2

                            indicates a window that has no special interpretation.                               2

              <b>-zoomed</b>
                     Requests  that  the  window  should  be  maximized.  This is the same as <b>wm</b> <b>state</b> <b>zoomed</b> on
                     Windows and macOS.

              On X11, changes to window attributes are  performed  asynchronously.  Querying  the  value  of  an
              attribute  returns the current state, which will not be the same as the value most recently set if
              the window manager has not yet processed the request or if it does not support the attribute.

       <b>wm</b> <b>client</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>name</u>?
              If <u>name</u> is specified, this command stores <u>name</u> (which should be the name of the host on which  the
              application  is executing) in <u>window</u>'s <b>WM_CLIENT_MACHINE</b> property for use by the window manager or
              session manager.  The command returns an empty string in this case.  If <u>name</u> is not specified, the
              command returns the last name set in a <b>wm</b> <b>client</b> command for <u>window</u>.  If <u>name</u> is specified  as  an
              empty string, the command deletes the <b>WM_CLIENT_MACHINE</b> property from <u>window</u>.

       <b>wm</b> <b>colormapwindows</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>windowList</u>?
              This command is used to manipulate the <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property, which provides information to
              the window managers about windows that have private colormaps.

              If  <u>windowList</u>  is  not  specified, the command returns a list whose elements are the names of the
              windows in the <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property.  If <u>windowList</u> is specified, it consists of a list of
              window path names;  the command overwrites the <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property with the given windows
              and returns an empty string.  The <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property should normally contain a  list  of
              the internal windows within <u>window</u> whose colormaps differ from their parents.

              The  order  of  the  windows  in  the property indicates a priority order: the window manager will
              attempt to install as many colormaps as possible from the head of this list when <u>window</u>  gets  the
              colormap  focus.  If <u>window</u> is not included among the windows in <u>windowList</u>, Tk implicitly adds it
              at the end of the <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property, so that its colormap is lowest in priority.  If <b>wm</b>
              <b>colormapwindows</b> is not invoked, Tk will automatically set the property for each  top-level  window
              to  all  the internal windows whose colormaps differ from their parents, followed by the top-level
              itself;  the order of the internal windows is undefined.  See the  ICCCM  documentation  for  more
              information on the <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property.

       <b>wm</b> <b>command</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>value</u>?
              If  <u>value</u>  is  specified, this command stores <u>value</u> in <u>window</u>'s <b>WM_COMMAND</b> property for use by the
              window manager or session manager and returns an  empty  string.   <u>Value</u>  must  have  proper  list
              structure;   the  elements should contain the words of the command used to invoke the application.
              If <u>value</u> is not specified then the command returns the last value set in a <b>wm</b> <b>command</b> command  for
              <u>window</u>.   If  <u>value</u>  is  specified as an empty string, the command deletes the <b>WM_COMMAND</b> property
              from <u>window</u>.

       <b>wm</b> <b>deiconify</b> <u>window</u>
              Arrange for <u>window</u> to be displayed in normal (non-iconified) form.  This is done  by  mapping  the
              window.   If  the  window  has never been mapped then this command will not map the window, but it
              will ensure that when the window is first mapped it will be displayed in  de-iconified  form.   On
              Windows, a deiconified window will also be raised and be given the focus (made the active window).
              Returns an empty string.

       <b>wm</b> <b>focusmodel</b> <u>window</u> ?<b>active</b>|<b>passive</b>?
              If  <b>active</b>  or  <b>passive</b>  is supplied as an optional argument to the command, then it specifies the
              focus model for <u>window</u>.  In this case the command returns  an  empty  string.   If  no  additional
              argument is supplied, then the command returns the current focus model for <u>window</u>.

              An  <b>active</b> focus model means that <u>window</u> will claim the input focus for itself or its descendants,
              even at times when the focus is currently in some other application.  <b>Passive</b>  means  that  <u>window</u>
              will  never  claim  the  focus  for itself:  the window manager should give the focus to <u>window</u> at
              appropriate times.  However, once the focus has been given to <u>window</u> or one  of  its  descendants,
              the  application  may re-assign the focus among <u>window</u>'s descendants.  The focus model defaults to
              <b>passive</b>, and Tk's <b>focus</b> command assumes a passive model of focusing.

       <b>wm</b> <b>forget</b> <u>window</u>
              The <u>window</u> will be unmapped from the screen and will no longer be managed by <b>wm</b>.  Windows  created
              with  the  <b>toplevel</b>  command will be treated like <b>frame</b> windows once they are no longer managed by
              <b>wm</b>, however, the <b>-menu</b> configuration will be remembered and the menus will return once the  widget
              is managed again.

       <b>wm</b> <b>frame</b> <u>window</u>
              If  <u>window</u>  has been reparented by the window manager into a decorative frame, the command returns
              the platform specific window identifier for the outermost frame that contains <u>window</u>  (the  window
              whose  parent  is  the  root  or  virtual  root).  If <u>window</u> has not been reparented by the window
              manager then the command returns the platform specific window identifier for <u>window</u>.

       <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>newGeometry</u>?
              If <u>newGeometry</u> is specified, then the geometry of  <u>window</u>  is  changed  and  an  empty  string  is
              returned.  Otherwise the current geometry for <u>window</u> is returned (this is the most recent geometry
              specified  either  by  manual  resizing  or  in  a <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> command).  <u>NewGeometry</u> has the form
              <b>=</b><u>width</u><b>x</b><u>height</u><b>±</b><u>x</u><b>±</b><u>y</u>, where any of <b>=</b>, <u>width</u><b>x</b><u>height</u>, or <b>±</b><u>x</u><b>±</b><u>y</u> may be omitted.   <u>Width</u>  and  <u>height</u>  are
              positive  integers specifying the desired dimensions of <u>window</u>.  If <u>window</u> is gridded (see <b>GRIDDED</b>
              <b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b> below) then the dimensions are specified in grid units;   otherwise  they  are
              specified in pixel units.

              <u>X</u>  and  <u>y</u> specify the desired location of <u>window</u> on the screen, in pixels.  If <u>x</u> is preceded by <b>+</b>,
              it specifies the number of pixels between the left edge  of  the  screen  and  the  left  edge  of
              <u>window</u>'s border;  if preceded by <b>-</b> then <u>x</u> specifies the number of pixels between the right edge of
              the  screen  and  the  right edge of <u>window</u>'s border.  If <u>y</u> is preceded by <b>+</b> then it specifies the
              number of pixels between the top of the screen and the top of <u>window</u>'s border;  if <u>y</u>  is  preceded
              by  <b>-</b>  then it specifies the number of pixels between the bottom of <u>window</u>'s border and the bottom
              of the screen.

              If <u>newGeometry</u> is specified as an empty string  then  any  existing  user-specified  geometry  for
              <u>window</u> is cancelled, and the window will revert to the size requested internally by its widgets.

              Note  that  this is related to <b>winfo</b> <b>geometry</b>, but not the same. That can only query the geometry,
              and always reflects Tk's current understanding of the actual size and location of <u>window</u>,  whereas
              <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> allows both setting and querying of the <u>window</u> <u>manager</u>'s understanding of the size and
              location  of  the  window.  This  can  vary  significantly, for example to reflect the addition of
              decorative elements to <u>window</u> such as  title  bars,  and  window  managers  are  not  required  to
              precisely follow the requests made through this command.

       <b>wm</b> <b>grid</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>baseWidth</u> <u>baseHeight</u> <u>widthInc</u> <u>heightInc</u>?
              This  command  indicates  that <u>window</u> is to be managed as a gridded window.  It also specifies the
              relationship between grid units and pixel units.  <u>BaseWidth</u> and <u>baseHeight</u> specify the  number  of
              grid   units   corresponding  to  the  pixel  dimensions  requested  internally  by  <u>window</u>  using
              <b>Tk_GeometryRequest</b>.  <u>WidthInc</u> and <u>heightInc</u> specify the number of pixels in  each  horizontal  and
              vertical  grid  unit.   These  four  values  determine  a  range  of  acceptable sizes for <u>window</u>,
              corresponding to grid-based widths and heights that are non-negative integers.  Tk will pass  this
              information  to  the window manager;  during manual resizing, the window manager will restrict the
              window's size to one of these acceptable sizes.

              Furthermore, during manual resizing the window manager will display the window's current  size  in
              terms  of  grid  units  rather than pixels.  If <u>baseWidth</u> etc. are all specified as empty strings,
              then <u>window</u> will no longer be managed as a gridded window.  If <u>baseWidth</u> etc. are  specified  then
              the return value is an empty string.

              Otherwise  the  return  value  is a Tcl list containing four elements corresponding to the current
              <u>baseWidth</u>, <u>baseHeight</u>, <u>widthInc</u>, and <u>heightInc</u>;  if <u>window</u> is not currently gridded, then an empty
              string is returned.

              Note that this command should not be needed very often, since the <b>Tk_SetGrid</b> library procedure and
              the <b>setGrid</b> option provide easier access to the same functionality.

       <b>wm</b> <b>group</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>pathName</u>?
              If <u>pathName</u> is specified, it gives the path name for the leader of a  group  of  related  windows.
              The  window  manager may use this information, for example, to unmap all of the windows in a group
              when the group's leader is iconified.  <u>PathName</u> may be specified as  an  empty  string  to  remove
              <u>window</u>  from  any  group  association.  If <u>pathName</u> is specified then the command returns an empty
              string;  otherwise it returns the path name of <u>window</u>'s current group leader, or an  empty  string
              if <u>window</u> is not part of any group.

       <b>wm</b> <b>iconbadge</b> <u>window</u> <u>badge</u>
              Sets  a badge for the icon of the <u>window</u>. The badge can be a positive integer number, for instance
              the number of new or unread messages, or an exclamation point denoting attention  needed.  If  the
              badge  is  an  empty  string, the badge image is removed from the application icon. Managing these
              changes through bindings, such as &lt;FocusIn&gt;, is the responsibility of the developer.

              On X11, for this command to work, the variable <b>::tk::icons::base_icon($window)</b> must be set to  the
              image  that is being used for the window icon of $window. On Windows and X11, the iconphoto images
              work best at 32x32 or a similar dimension, as the badge images are provided by  Tk  and  drawn  to
              overlay  the icon images using native (Windows) API's or Tk rendering. On macOS, the icon badge is
              rendered by a system API and is not provided by Tk.  The  icon  image  itself  should  be  higher-
              resolution, preferably 512 pixels, to avoid being blurry.

              The  icon badge is intended for display in the Dock (macOS), taskbar (Windows) or app panel (X11).
              On macOS, the last badge called will be displayed in the Dock, regardless of  how  many  different
              icon  badges  may  be  assigned  to  different windows. On Windows, the taskbar display depends on
              whether the taskbar buttons are combined or not (this is an OS setting available to the user):  if
              combined,  the  behavior  is  the same as on macOS, otherwise each button in the taskbar shows the
              badge it was assigned.  Badge display on macOS is configured in the system preferences. App  panel
              display behavior on X11 will depend on the window manager and/or desktop environment.

       <b>wm</b> <b>iconbitmap</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>bitmap</u>?
              If  <u>bitmap</u>  is  specified,  then  it  names a bitmap in the standard forms accepted by Tk (see the
              <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b> manual entry for details).  This bitmap  is  passed  to  the  window  manager  to  be
              displayed  in  <u>window</u>'s  icon,  and  the  command  returns an empty string.  If an empty string is
              specified for <u>bitmap</u>, then any current  icon  bitmap  is  cancelled  for  <u>window</u>.   If  <u>bitmap</u>  is
              specified  then the command returns an empty string.  Otherwise it returns the name of the current
              icon bitmap associated with <u>window</u>, or an empty string if <u>window</u>  has  no  icon  bitmap.   On  the
              Windows operating system, an additional flag is supported:

              <b>wm</b> <b>iconbitmap</b> <u>window</u> ?<b>-default</b>? ?<u>image</u>?
                     If  the  <b>-default</b>  flag is given, the icon is applied to all toplevel windows (existing and
                     future) to which no other specific icon has yet been applied.  In addition to bitmap  image
                     types,  a  full  path specification to any file which contains a valid Windows icon is also
                     accepted (usually .ico or .icr files), or any file for which  the  shell  has  assigned  an
                     icon.   Tcl  will first test if the file contains an icon, then if it has an assigned icon,
                     and finally, if that fails, test for a bitmap.

       <b>wm</b> <b>iconify</b> <u>window</u>
              Arrange for <u>window</u> to be iconified.  It <u>window</u> has not yet been mapped for the  first  time,  this
              command will arrange for it to appear in the iconified state when it is eventually mapped.

       <b>wm</b> <b>iconmask</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>bitmap</u>?
              If  <u>bitmap</u>  is  specified,  then  it  names a bitmap in the standard forms accepted by Tk (see the
              <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b> manual entry for details).  This bitmap is passed to the window manager to be used as
              a mask in conjunction with the <b>iconbitmap</b> option:  where the mask  has  zeroes  no  icon  will  be
              displayed;   where  it  has  ones,  the  bits from the icon bitmap will be displayed.  If an empty
              string is specified for <u>bitmap</u> then any current  icon  mask  is  cancelled  for  <u>window</u>  (this  is
              equivalent  to  specifying a bitmap of all ones).  If <u>bitmap</u> is specified then the command returns
              an empty string.  Otherwise it returns the name of the current icon mask associated  with  <u>window</u>,
              or an empty string if no mask is in effect.

       <b>wm</b> <b>iconname</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>newName</u>?
              If  <u>newName</u>  is  specified,  then  it  is passed to the window manager;  the window manager should
              display <u>newName</u> inside the icon associated with <u>window</u>.  In this case an empty string is  returned
              as result.  If <u>newName</u> is not specified then the command returns the current icon name for <u>window</u>,
              or  an  empty  string  if  no  icon  name has been specified (in this case the window manager will
              normally display the window's title, as specified with the <b>wm</b> <b>title</b> command).

       <b>wm</b> <b>iconphoto</b> <u>window</u> ?<b>-default</b>? <u>image1</u> ?<u>image2</u> <u>...</u>?
              Sets the titlebar icon for <u>window</u> based on the named photo images.  If <b>-default</b> is specified, this
              is applied to all future created toplevels as well.  The data in the images is taken as a snapshot
              at the time of invocation.  If the images are later changed, this is not reflected to the titlebar
              icons.  Multiple images are accepted to allow different images sizes (e.g., 16x16 and 32x32) to be
              provided. The window manager may scale provided icons to an appropriate size.

              On Windows, the images are packed into a Windows  icon  structure.   This  will  override  an  ico
              specified to <b>wm</b> <b>iconbitmap</b>, and vice versa. This command sets the taskbar icon for the window.

              On  X, the images are arranged into the _NET_WM_ICON X property, which most modern window managers
              support.  A <b>wm</b> <b>iconbitmap</b> may exist simultaneously.  It is recommended to  use  not  more  than  2
              icons, placing the larger icon first. This command also sets the panel icon for the application if
              the window manager or desktop environment supports it.

              On  Macintosh,  the  first  image  called is loaded into an OS-native icon format, and becomes the
              application icon in dialogs, the Dock, and other contexts. At the script level  the  command  will
              accept  only the first image passed in the parameters as support for multiple sizes/resolutions on
              macOS is outside Tk's scope. Developers should use the largest icon they can  support  (preferably
              512 pixels) to ensure smooth rendering on the Mac.

       <b>wm</b> <b>iconposition</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>x</u> <u>y</u>?
              If  <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are specified, they are passed to the window manager as a hint about where to position
              the icon for <u>window</u>.  In this case an empty string is returned.  If <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are specified as empty
              strings then any existing icon position hint is cancelled.  If neither <u>x</u> nor <u>y</u> is specified,  then
              the  command  returns  a Tcl list containing two values, which are the current icon position hints
              (if no hints are in effect then an empty string is returned).

       <b>wm</b> <b>iconwindow</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>pathName</u>?
              If <u>pathName</u> is specified, it is the path name for a window to use as icon for <u>window</u>: when  <u>window</u>
              is  iconified  then <u>pathName</u> will be mapped to serve as icon, and when <u>window</u> is de-iconified then
              <u>pathName</u> will be unmapped again.  If <u>pathName</u> is specified as an empty string  then  any  existing
              icon  window association for <u>window</u> will be cancelled.  If the <u>pathName</u> argument is specified then
              an empty string is returned.  Otherwise the command returns the path  name  of  the  current  icon
              window  for  <u>window</u>, or an empty string if there is no icon window currently specified for <u>window</u>.
              Button press events are disabled for <u>window</u> as long as it is an icon window;  this  is  needed  in
              order  to  allow window managers to “own” those events.  Note that not all window managers support
              the notion of an icon window, and the concept is entirely meaningless on non-X11 platforms.

       <b>wm</b> <b>manage</b> <u>widget</u>
              The <u>widget</u> specified will become a stand alone top-level window.  The  window  will  be  decorated
              with  the  window managers title bar, etc. Only <u>frame</u>, <u>labelframe</u> and <u>toplevel</u> widgets can be used
              with this command. Attempting to pass any other widget type will raise  an  error.  Attempting  to
              manage a <u>toplevel</u> widget is benign and achieves nothing. See also <b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b>.

       <b>wm</b> <b>maxsize</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>width</u> <u>height</u>?
              If  <u>width</u>  and <u>height</u> are specified, they give the maximum permissible dimensions for <u>window</u>.  For
              gridded windows the dimensions are specified in grid units;  otherwise they are specified in pixel
              units.  The window manager will restrict the window's dimensions to be less than or equal to <u>width</u>
              and <u>height</u>.  If <u>width</u> and <u>height</u>  are  specified,  then  the  command  returns  an  empty  string.
              Otherwise  it  returns  a  Tcl  list  with  two  elements,  which are the maximum width and height
              currently in effect.  The maximum size defaults to the size of the screen.  See  the  sections  on
              geometry management below for more information.

       <b>wm</b> <b>minsize</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>width</u> <u>height</u>?
              If  <u>width</u>  and <u>height</u> are specified, they give the minimum permissible dimensions for <u>window</u>.  For
              gridded windows the dimensions are specified in grid units;  otherwise they are specified in pixel
              units.  The window manager will restrict the window's dimensions to be greater than  or  equal  to
              <u>width</u>  and  <u>height</u>.   If <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> are specified, then the command returns an empty string.
              Otherwise it returns a Tcl list with  two  elements,  which  are  the  minimum  width  and  height
              currently  in effect.  The minimum size defaults to one pixel in each dimension.  See the sections
              on geometry management below for more information.

       <b>wm</b> <b>overrideredirect</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>boolean</u>?
              If <u>boolean</u> is specified, it must have a proper boolean form and  the  override-redirect  flag  for
              <u>window</u>  is  set  to  that  value.  If <u>boolean</u> is not specified then <b>1</b> or <b>0</b> is returned to indicate
              whether or not the override-redirect flag is currently set  for  <u>window</u>.   Setting  the  override-
              redirect  flag  for  a  window causes it to be ignored by the window manager;  among other things,
              this means that the window will not be reparented from the root window into a decorative frame and
              the user will not be able to manipulate the window using the normal window manager mechanisms.

              Note that the override-redirect flag is only guaranteed to be taken notice of when the  window  is
              first  mapped  or  when  mapped after the state is changed from withdrawn to normal. Some, but not
              all, platforms will take notice at additional times.

       <b>wm</b> <b>positionfrom</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>who</u>?
              If <u>who</u> is specified, it must be either <b>program</b> or <b>user</b>, or an abbreviation of one  of  these  two.
              It  indicates whether <u>window</u>'s current position was requested by the program or by the user.  Many
              window managers ignore program-requested initial positions and ask the user to  manually  position
              the  window;  if <b>user</b> is specified then the window manager should position the window at the given
              place without asking the user for assistance.  If <u>who</u> is specified as an empty  string,  then  the
              current  position  source  is  cancelled.   If <u>who</u> is specified, then the command returns an empty
              string.  Otherwise it returns <b>user</b> or <b>program</b> to indicate  the  source  of  the  window's  current
              position,  or an empty string if no source has been specified yet.  Most window managers interpret
              “no source” as equivalent to <b>program</b>.  Tk will automatically set the position source to <b>user</b>  when
              a <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> command is invoked, unless the source has been set explicitly to <b>program</b>.

       <b>wm</b> <b>protocol</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>name</u>? ?<u>command</u>?
              This  command  is  used  to  manage window manager protocols. The <u>name</u> argument in the <b>wm</b> <b>protocol</b>
              command is the name of an atom corresponding to  a  window  manager  protocol.   Examples  include
              <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b> or <b>WM_SAVE_YOURSELF</b> or <b>WM_TAKE_FOCUS</b>.

              A  <u>window</u>  <u>manager</u>  <u>protocol</u> is a class of messages sent from a window manager to a Tk application
              outside of the normal event processing system. The main example is the <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b>  protocol;
              these  messages  are  sent  when  the  user  clicks the close widget in the title bar of a window.
              Handlers for window manager protocols are installed with the <b>wm</b> <b>protocol</b> command. As a rule, if no
              handler has been installed for a protocol by the <b>wm</b> <b>protocol</b> command then  all  messages  of  that
              protocol  are  ignored. The <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b> protocol is an exception to this rule. At start-up Tk
              installs a handler for this protocol, which responds by destroying the  window.  The  <b>wm</b>  <b>protocol</b>
              command can be used to replace this default handler by one which responds differently.

              The  list  of  available  window  manager  protocols depends on the window manager, but all window
              managers supported by Tk provide <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b>. On the  Windows  platform,  a  <b>WM_SAVE_YOURSELF</b>
              message is sent on user logout or system restart.

              If  both  <u>name</u>  and  <u>command</u>  are  specified,  then  <u>command</u>  becomes the handler for the protocol
              specified by <u>name</u>. The atom for <u>name</u> will be added to <u>window</u>'s <b>WM_PROTOCOLS</b> property to  tell  the
              window  manager that the application has a handler for the protocol specified by <u>name</u>, and <u>command</u>
              will be invoked in the future whenever the window manager sends a message of that protocol to  the
              Tk  application.   In  this  case  the  <b>wm</b>  <b>protocol</b>  command returns an empty string.  If <u>name</u> is
              specified but <u>command</u> is not, then the current handler for <u>name</u> is returned, or an empty string if
              there is no handler defined for <u>name</u> (as a special case, the default handler for  <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b>
              is  not  returned).   If <u>command</u> is specified as an empty string then the atom for <u>name</u> is removed
              from the <b>WM_PROTOCOLS</b> property of <u>window</u>  and  the  handler  is  destroyed;  an  empty  string  is
              returned.   Lastly,  if  neither  <u>name</u> nor <u>command</u> is specified, the <b>wm</b> <b>protocol</b> command returns a
              list of all of the protocols for which handlers are currently defined for <u>window</u>.

       <b>wm</b> <b>resizable</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>width</u> <u>height</u>?
              This command controls whether or not the user may interactively resize  a  top-level  window.   If
              <u>width</u>  and  <u>height</u>  are  specified,  they  are boolean values that determine whether the width and
              height of <u>window</u> may be modified by the user.  In this case the command returns an  empty  string.
              If  <u>width</u>  and  <u>height</u>  are  omitted  then  the  command returns a list with two 0/1 elements that
              indicate whether the width and height of <u>window</u> are currently resizable.  By default, windows  are
              resizable  in  both  dimensions.  If resizing is disabled, then the window's size will be the size
              from the most recent interactive resize or <b>wm</b>  <b>geometry</b>  command.   If  there  has  been  no  such
              operation then the window's natural size will be used.

       <b>wm</b> <b>sizefrom</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>who</u>?
              If  <u>who</u>  is  specified, it must be either <b>program</b> or <b>user</b>, or an abbreviation of one of these two.
              It indicates whether <u>window</u>'s current size was requested by the program  or  by  the  user.   Some
              window  managers  ignore program-requested sizes and ask the user to manually size the window;  if
              <b>user</b> is specified then the window manager should give the window its specified size without asking
              the user for assistance.  If <u>who</u> is specified as an empty string, then the current size source  is
              cancelled.   If  <u>who</u> is specified, then the command returns an empty string.  Otherwise it returns
              <b>user</b> or <b>window</b> to indicate the source of the window's current size,  or  an  empty  string  if  no
              source  has  been  specified  yet.   Most  window  managers interpret “no source” as equivalent to
              <b>program</b>.

       <b>wm</b> <b>stackorder</b> <u>window</u> ?<b>isabove</b>|<b>isbelow</b> <u>window</u>?
              The <b>stackorder</b> command returns a list of toplevel  windows  in  stacking  order,  from  lowest  to
              highest.  When  a  single toplevel window is passed, the returned list recursively includes all of
              the window's children that are toplevels. Only those toplevels that are currently  mapped  to  the
              screen  are  returned.   The  <b>stackorder</b>  command can also be used to determine if one toplevel is
              positioned above or below a second toplevel.   When  two  window  arguments  separated  by  either
              <b>isabove</b>  or  <b>isbelow</b>  are  passed,  a  boolean result indicates whether or not the first window is
              currently above or below the second window in the stacking order.

       <b>wm</b> <b>state</b> <u>window</u> ?newstate?
              If <u>newstate</u> is specified, the window will be set to  the  new  state,  otherwise  it  returns  the
              current  state  of  <u>window</u>:  either  <b>normal</b>,  <b>iconic</b>, <b>withdrawn</b>, <b>icon</b>, or (Windows and macOS only)
              <b>zoomed</b>.  The difference between <b>iconic</b> and <b>icon</b> is that <b>iconic</b> refers to a window  that  has  been
              iconified  (e.g., with the <b>wm</b> <b>iconify</b> command) while <b>icon</b> refers to a window whose only purpose is
              to serve as the icon for some other window (via the <b>wm</b> <b>iconwindow</b> command).  The <b>icon</b> state cannot
              be set.

       <b>wm</b> <b>title</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>string</u>?
              If <u>string</u> is specified, then it will be passed to the window manager for  use  as  the  title  for
              <u>window</u>  (the  window  manager should display this string in <u>window</u>'s title bar).  In this case the
              command returns an empty string.  If <u>string</u> is not specified then the command returns the  current
              title for the <u>window</u>.  The title for a window defaults to its name.

       <b>wm</b> <b>transient</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>container</u>?
              If  <u>container</u>  is specified, then the window manager is informed that <u>window</u> is a transient window
              (e.g. pull-down menu) working on behalf of <u>container</u> (where <u>container</u> is the path name for a  top-
              level  window).  If <u>container</u> is specified as an empty string then <u>window</u> is marked as not being a
              transient window any more.  Otherwise the command  returns  the  path  name  of  <u>window</u>'s  current
              container,  or  an empty string if <u>window</u> is not currently a transient window.  A transient window
              will mirror state changes in the container and inherit the state of the container  when  initially
              mapped.  The directed graph with an edge from each transient to its container must be acyclic.  In
              particular, it is an error to attempt to make a window a transient of itself.  The window  manager
              may  also  decorate a transient window differently, removing some features normally present (e.g.,
              minimize and maximize buttons) though this is entirely at the discretion of the window manager.

       <b>wm</b> <b>withdraw</b> <u>window</u>
              Arranges for <u>window</u> to be withdrawn from the screen.  This causes the window to  be  unmapped  and
              forgotten  about  by  the  window manager.  If the window has never been mapped, then this command
              causes the window to be mapped in the withdrawn state.  Not all window managers appear to know how
              to handle windows that are mapped in the withdrawn state.  Note that  it  sometimes  seems  to  be
              necessary  to  withdraw  a  window  and then re-map it (e.g. with <b>wm</b> <b>deiconify</b>) to get some window
              managers to pay attention to changes in window attributes such as group.

</pre><h4><b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b></h4><pre>
       By default a top-level window appears on the screen in its <u>natural</u> <u>size</u>,  which  is  the  one  determined
       internally by its widgets and geometry managers.  If the natural size of a top-level window changes, then
       the  window's  size changes to match.  A top-level window can be given a size other than its natural size
       in two ways.  First, the user can resize the window manually using the facilities of the window  manager,
       such  as  resize  handles.   Second, the application can request a particular size for a top-level window
       using the <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> command.  These two cases are handled identically  by  Tk;   in  either  case,  the
       requested  size  overrides  the  natural  size.   You can return the window to its natural by invoking <b>wm</b>
       <b>geometry</b> with an empty <u>geometry</u> string.

       Normally a top-level window can have any size from one pixel in each dimension up  to  the  size  of  its
       screen.   However,  you  can  use  the <b>wm</b> <b>minsize</b> and <b>wm</b> <b>maxsize</b> commands to limit the range of allowable
       sizes.  The range set by <b>wm</b> <b>minsize</b> and <b>wm</b> <b>maxsize</b> applies  to  all  forms  of  resizing,  including  the
       window's  natural  size  as  well  as  manual resizes and the <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> command.  You can use any value
       accepted by <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  You can also use the command <b>wm</b> <b>resizable</b> to  completely  disable  interactive
       resizing in one or both dimensions.

       The  <b>wm</b>  <b>manage</b>  and <b>wm</b> <b>forget</b> commands may be used to perform undocking and docking of windows.  After a
       widget is managed by <b>wm</b> <b>manage</b> command, all other <b>wm</b> subcommands may  be  used  with  the  widget.   Only
       widgets  created  using the toplevel command may have an attached menu via the <b>-menu</b> configure option.  A
       toplevel widget may be used as a frame and managed with any of the other geometry  managers  after  using
       the <b>wm</b> <b>forget</b> command.  Any menu associated with a toplevel widget will be hidden when managed by another
       geometry  managers.   The  menus will reappear once the window is managed by <b>wm</b>.  All custom bindtags for
       widgets in a subtree that have their top-level widget changed via a <b>wm</b> <b>manage</b> or <b>wm</b> <b>forget</b> command,  must
       be  redone to adjust any top-level widget path in the bindtags. Bindtags that have not been customized do
       not have to be redone.

</pre><h4><b>GRIDDED</b> <b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Gridded geometry management occurs when one of the widgets of an application supports a range  of  useful
       sizes.   This occurs, for example, in a text editor where the scrollbars, menus, and other adornments are
       fixed in size but the edit widget can support any number of lines of text or  characters  per  line.   In
       this  case,  it  is usually desirable to let the user specify the number of lines or characters-per-line,
       either with the <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> command or by interactively resizing the window.  In the case of text, and in
       other interesting cases also, only discrete sizes of the window make sense, such as integral  numbers  of
       lines and characters-per-line;  arbitrary pixel sizes are not useful.

       Gridded  geometry  management provides support for this kind of application.  Tk (and the window manager)
       assume that there is a grid of some sort within the  application  and  that  the  application  should  be
       resized  in  terms of <u>grid</u> <u>units</u> rather than pixels.  Gridded geometry management is typically invoked by
       turning on the <b>setGrid</b> option for a widget;  it can also be invoked  with  the  <b>wm</b>  <b>grid</b>  command  or  by
       calling  <b>Tk_SetGrid</b>.   In  each  of  these  approaches  the  particular  widget (or sometimes code in the
       application as a whole) specifies the relationship between integral grid sizes for the window  and  pixel
       sizes.  To return to non-gridded geometry management, invoke <b>wm</b> <b>grid</b> with empty argument strings.

       When  gridded geometry management is enabled then all the dimensions specified in <b>wm</b> <b>minsize</b>, <b>wm</b> <b>maxsize</b>,
       and <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> commands are treated as grid units rather than pixel units.  Interactive resizing is also
       carried out in even numbers of grid units rather than pixels.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Most existing window managers appear to have bugs that affect the  operation  of  the  <b>wm</b>  command.   For
       example,  some  changes will not take effect if the window is already active:  the window will have to be
       withdrawn and de-iconified in order to make the change happen.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       A fixed-size window that says that it is fixed-size too:
              toplevel .fixed
              <b>wm</b> <b>title</b>     .fixed "Fixed-size Window"
              <b>wm</b> <b>resizable</b> .fixed 0 0

       A simple dialog-like window, centred on the screen:
              # Create and arrange the dialog contents.
              toplevel .msg
              label  .msg.l  -text "This is a very simple dialog demo."
              button .msg.ok -text OK -default active -command {destroy .msg}
              pack .msg.ok -side bottom -fill x
              pack .msg.l  -expand 1    -fill both

              # Now set the widget up as a centred dialog.

              # But first, we need the geometry managers to finish setting
              # up the interior of the dialog, for which we need to run the
              # event loop with the widget hidden completely...
              <b>wm</b> <b>withdraw</b> .msg
              update
              set x [expr {([winfo screenwidth .] - [winfo width .msg]) / 2}]
              set y [expr {([winfo screenheight .] - [winfo height .msg]) / 2}]
              <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b>  .msg +$x+$y
              <b>wm</b> <b>transient</b> .msg .
              <b>wm</b> <b>title</b>     .msg "Dialog demo"
              <b>wm</b> <b>deiconify</b> .msg
