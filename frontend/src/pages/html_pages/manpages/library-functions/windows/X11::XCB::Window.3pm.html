</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       X11::XCB::Window - represents an X11 window

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>rect</b>
       As long as the window is not mapped, this returns the planned geometry. As soon as the window is mapped,
       this returns its geometry <b>including</b> the window decorations.

       Thus, after the window is mapped, every time you access "rect", the geometry will be determined by
       querying X11 about it, thus generating at least 1 round- trip for non-reparenting window managers and two
       or more round-trips for reparenting window managers.

       In scalar context it returns only the window’s geometry, in list context it returns the window’s geometry
       and the geometry of the top window (the one containing this window but the first one under the root
       window in hierarchy).

   <b>attributes</b>
       Returns the X11 attributes of this window.

   <b>map</b>
       Maps the window on the screen, that is, makes it visible.

   <b>unmap</b>
       The opposite of map, that is, makes your window invisible.

   <b>destroy</b>
       Destroys the window completely

   <b>mapped</b>
       Returns whether the window is actually mapped (no internal state, but gets the window attributes from X11
       and checks for MAP_STATE_VIEWABLE).

   <b>create_child(options)</b>
       Creates a new "X11::XCB::Window" as a child window of the current window.

   <b>add_hint($hint)</b>
       Adds the given $hint (one of "urgency") to the window’s set of hints.

   <b>delete_hint($hint)</b>
       Opposite of add_hint.

   <b>warp_pointer($x,</b> <b>$y)</b>
       Moves the pointer to the offsets ($x, $y) relative to the origin of the window on which it is called. If
       $x and $y are undef, moves the pointer into the center of the window.

   <b>state</b>
       Returns the WM_STATE of this window (normal, withdrawn, iconic).
