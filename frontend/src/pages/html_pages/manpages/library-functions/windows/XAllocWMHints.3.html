</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XAllocWMHints,  XSetWMHints,  XGetWMHints,  XWMHints - allocate window manager hints structure and set or
       read a window's WM_HINTS property

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>

       XWMHints *XAllocWMHints(void);

       int XSetWMHints(Display *<u>display</u>, Window <u>w</u>, XWMHints *<u>wmhints</u>);

       XWMHints *XGetWMHints(Display *<u>display</u>, Window <u>w</u>);

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>display</u>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <u>w</u>         Specifies the window.

       <u>wmhints</u>   Specifies the <b>XWMHints</b> structure to be used.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>XAllocWMHints</b> function allocates and returns a pointer to a <b>XWMHints</b> structure.  Note that all fields
       in the <b>XWMHints</b> structure are initially set to zero.  If insufficient memory is available,  <b>XAllocWMHints</b>
       returns NULL.  To free the memory allocated to this structure, use <b>XFree</b>.

       The  <b>XSetWMHints</b>  function  sets the window manager hints that include icon information and location, the
       initial state of the window, and whether the application relies on the window  manager  to  get  keyboard
       input.

       <b>XSetWMHints</b> can generate <b>BadAlloc</b> and <b>BadWindow</b> errors.

       The  <b>XGetWMHints</b> function reads the window manager hints and returns NULL if no WM_HINTS property was set
       on the window or returns a pointer to a <b>XWMHints</b> structure if it succeeds.  When finished with the  data,
       free the space used for it by calling <b>XFree</b>.

       <b>XGetWMHints</b> can generate a <b>BadWindow</b> error.

</pre><h4><b>PROPERTIES</b></h4><pre>
       WM_HINTS  Additional  hints set by the client for use by the window manager.  The C type of this property
                 is <b>XWMHints</b>.

</pre><h4><b>STRUCTURES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>XWMHints</b> structure contains:

       /* Window manager hints mask bits */
       #define   <b>InputHint</b>            (1L &lt;&lt; 0)
       #define   <b>StateHint</b>            (1L &lt;&lt; 1)
       #define   <b>IconPixmapHint</b>       (1L &lt;&lt; 2)
       #define   <b>IconWindowHint</b>       (1L &lt;&lt; 3)
       #define   <b>IconPositionHint</b>     (1L &lt;&lt; 4)
       #define   <b>IconMaskHint</b>         (1L &lt;&lt; 5)
       #define   <b>WindowGroupHint</b>      (1L &lt;&lt; 6)
       #define   <b>XUrgencyHint</b>         (1L &lt;&lt; 8)
       #define   <b>AllHints</b>             (InputHint|
                                       StateHint|
                                       IconPixmapHint|
                                       IconWindowHint|
                                       IconPositionHint|
                                       IconMaskHint|
                                       WindowGroupHint)
       /* Values */

       typedef struct {
               long flags;     /* marks which fields in this structure are defined */
               Bool input;     /* does this application rely on the window manager to
                               get keyboard input? */
               int initial_state;      /* see below */
               Pixmap icon_pixmap;     /* pixmap to be used as icon */
               Window icon_window;     /* window to be used as icon */
               int icon_x, icon_y;     /* initial position of icon */
               Pixmap icon_mask;       /* pixmap to be used as mask for icon_pixmap */
               XID window_group;       /* id of related window group */
               /* this structure may be extended in the future */
       } XWMHints;

       The input member is used to communicate to  the  window  manager  the  input  focus  model  used  by  the
       application.   Applications  that  expect input but never explicitly set focus to any of their subwindows
       (that is, use the push model of focus management), such as X Version 10 style applications that use real-
       estate driven focus, should set this member to <b>True</b>.  Similarly, applications that  set  input  focus  to
       their subwindows only when it is given to their top-level window by a window manager should also set this
       member  to  <b>True</b>.   Applications  that manage their own input focus by explicitly setting focus to one of
       their subwindows whenever they want keyboard input (that is, use the  pull  model  of  focus  management)
       should  set this member to <b>False</b>.  Applications that never expect any keyboard input also should set this
       member to <b>False</b>.

       Pull model window managers should make it possible for push model applications to get  input  by  setting
       input  focus  to  the  top-level  windows  of applications whose input member is <b>True</b>.  Push model window
       managers should make sure that pull model applications do not break them  by  resetting  input  focus  to
       <b>PointerRoot</b> when it is appropriate (for example, whenever an application whose input member is <b>False</b> sets
       input focus to one of its subwindows).

       The definitions for the initial_state flag are:
       #define   <b>WithdrawnState</b>    0
       #define   <b>NormalState</b>       1   /* most applications start this way */
       #define   <b>IconicState</b>       3   /*  application  wants  to  start as an
                                       icon */
       The icon_mask specifies which pixels of the icon_pixmap should be used as  the  icon.   This  allows  for
       nonrectangular  icons.   Both  icon_pixmap  and  icon_mask  must  be  bitmaps.   The  icon_window lets an
       application provide a window for use as  an  icon  for  window  managers  that  support  such  use.   The
       window_group  lets  you  specify that this window belongs to a group of other windows.  For example, if a
       single application manipulates multiple top-level windows, this allows you to provide enough  information
       that a window manager can iconify all of the windows rather than just the one window.

       The  <b>UrgencyHint</b>  flag, if set in the flags field, indicates that the client deems the window contents to
       be urgent, requiring the timely response of the user.  The window manager will make some effort  to  draw
       the  user's attention to this window while this flag is set.  The client must provide some means by which
       the user can cause the urgency flag to be cleared (either mitigating the condition that made  the  window
       urgent or merely shutting off the alarm) or the window to be withdrawn.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BadAlloc</b>  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server memory.

       <b>BadWindow</b> A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
