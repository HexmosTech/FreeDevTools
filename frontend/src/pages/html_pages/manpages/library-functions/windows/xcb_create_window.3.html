</pre><h4><b>REQUEST</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>conn</u>      The XCB connection to X11.

       <u>depth</u>     Specifies the new window's depth (TODO: what unit?).

                 The special value <u>XCB_COPY_FROM_PARENT</u> means the depth is taken from the <u>parent</u> window.

       <u>wid</u>       The ID with which you will refer to the new window, created by <u>xcb_generate_id</u>.

       <u>parent</u>    The parent window of the new window.

       <u>x</u>         The X coordinate of the new window.

       <u>y</u>         The Y coordinate of the new window.

       <u>width</u>     The width of the new window.

       <u>height</u>    The height of the new window.

       <u>border_width</u>
                 TODO:

                 Must be zero if the <u>class</u> is <u>InputOnly</u> or a <u>xcb_match_error_t</u> occurs.

       <b>_</b><u>class</u>    One of the following values:

                 <u>XCB_WINDOW_CLASS_COPY_FROM_PARENT</u>
                           TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

                 <u>XCB_WINDOW_CLASS_INPUT_OUTPUT</u>
                           TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

                 <u>XCB_WINDOW_CLASS_INPUT_ONLY</u>
                           TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       <u>visual</u>    Specifies the id for the new window's visual.

                 The special value <u>XCB_COPY_FROM_PARENT</u> means the visual is taken from the <u>parent</u> window.

       <u>value_mask</u>
                 One of the following values:

                 <u>XCB_CW_BACK_PIXMAP</u>
                           Overrides  the  default background-pixmap. The background pixmap and window must have
                           the same root and same depth. Any size pixmap can be used, although some sizes may be
                           faster than others.

                           If <u>XCB_BACK_PIXMAP_NONE</u> is specified, the window  has  no  defined  background.   The
                           server  may  fill  the contents with the previous screen contents or with contents of
                           its own choosing.

                           If <u>XCB_BACK_PIXMAP_PARENT_RELATIVE</u> is specified, the parent's background is used, but
                           the window must have the same depth as the parent (or a Match error  results).    The
                           parent's  background is tracked, and the current version is used each time the window
                           background is required.

                 <u>XCB_CW_BACK_PIXEL</u>
                           Overrides <u>BackPixmap</u>. A pixmap of undefined size filled with the specified background
                           pixel is used for the background. Range-checking is  not  performed,  the  background
                           pixel is truncated to the appropriate number of bits.

                 <u>XCB_CW_BORDER_PIXMAP</u>
                           Overrides  the default border-pixmap. The border pixmap and window must have the same
                           root and the same depth. Any size pixmap can be used,  although  some  sizes  may  be
                           faster than others.

                           The  special  value  <u>XCB_COPY_FROM_PARENT</u>  means the parent's border pixmap is copied
                           (subsequent changes to the parent's border attribute do not affect  the  child),  but
                           the window must have the same depth as the parent.

                 <u>XCB_CW_BORDER_PIXEL</u>
                           Overrides  <u>BorderPixmap</u>.  A pixmap of undefined size filled with the specified border
                           pixel is used for the border. Range checking is not  performed  on  the  border-pixel
                           value, it is truncated to the appropriate number of bits.

                 <u>XCB_CW_BIT_GRAVITY</u>
                           Defines which region of the window should be retained if the window is resized.

                 <u>XCB_CW_WIN_GRAVITY</u>
                           Defines  how  the window should be repositioned if the parent is resized (see <u>Config‐</u>
                           <u>ureWindow</u>).

                 <u>XCB_CW_BACKING_STORE</u>
                           A backing-store of <u>WhenMapped</u> advises the server that  maintaining  contents  of  ob‐
                           scured  regions when the window is mapped would be beneficial. A backing-store of <u>Al‐</u>
                           <u>ways</u> advises the server that maintaining contents even when the  window  is  unmapped
                           would be beneficial. In this case, the server may generate an exposure event when the
                           window  is created. A value of <u>NotUseful</u> advises the server that maintaining contents
                           is unnecessary, although a server may still choose to  maintain  contents  while  the
                           window  is mapped. Note that if the server maintains contents, then the server should
                           maintain complete contents not just the region within the parent boundaries, even  if
                           the  window  is larger than its parent. While the server maintains contents, exposure
                           events will not normally be generated, but the server may stop  maintaining  contents
                           at any time.

                 <u>XCB_CW_BACKING_PLANES</u>
                           The backing-planes indicates (with bits set to 1) which bit planes of the window hold
                           dynamic data that must be preserved in backing-stores and during save-unders.

                 <u>XCB_CW_BACKING_PIXEL</u>
                           The  backing-pixel  specifies  what  value  to  use in planes not covered by backing-
                           planes. The server is free to save only the specified bit planes in the backing-store
                           or save-under and regenerate the remaining planes with the specified pixel value. Any
                           bits beyond the specified depth of the window in these values are simply ignored.

                 <u>XCB_CW_OVERRIDE_REDIRECT</u>
                           The override-redirect specifies whether map and configure  requests  on  this  window
                           should  override  a  SubstructureRedirect on the parent, typically to inform a window
                           manager not to tamper with the window.

                 <u>XCB_CW_SAVE_UNDER</u>
                           If 1, the server is advised that when this window is mapped, saving the  contents  of
                           windows it obscures would be beneficial.

                 <u>XCB_CW_EVENT_MASK</u>
                           The  event-mask  defines which events the client is interested in for this window (or
                           for some event types, inferiors of the window).

                 <u>XCB_CW_DONT_PROPAGATE</u>
                           The do-not-propagate-mask defines which events should not be propagated  to  ancestor
                           windows when no client has the event type selected in this window.

                 <u>XCB_CW_COLORMAP</u>
                           The colormap specifies the colormap that best reflects the true colors of the window.
                           Servers  capable  of supporting multiple hardware colormaps may use this information,
                           and window man- agers may use it for InstallColormap requests. The colormap must have
                           the same visual type and root as the window (or a  Match  error  results).  If  Copy‐
                           FromParent  is  specified, the parent's colormap is copied (subsequent changes to the
                           parent's colormap attribute do not affect the child).  However, the window must  have
                           the  same  visual  type as the parent (or a Match error results), and the parent must
                           not have a colormap of None (or a Match error results). For an explanation  of  None,
                           see  FreeColormap  request. The colormap is copied by sharing the colormap object be‐
                           tween the child and the parent, not by making a complete copy of  the  colormap  con‐
                           tents.

                 <u>XCB_CW_CURSOR</u>
                           If  a  cursor is specified, it will be used whenever the pointer is in the window. If
                           None is speci- fied, the parent's cursor will be used when the pointer is in the win‐
                           dow, and any change in the parent's cursor will cause an immediate change in the dis‐
                           played cursor.
                 TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

       <u>value_list</u>
                 TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Creates an unmapped window as child of the specified <u>parent</u> window. A CreateNotify event will be generat‐
       ed. The new window is placed on top in the stacking order with respect to siblings.

       The coordinate system has the X axis horizontal and the Y axis vertical with the origin [0, 0] at the up‐
       per-left corner. Coordinates are integral, in terms of pixels, and coincide with pixel centers. Each win‐
       dow and pixmap has its own coordinate system. For a window, the origin is inside the border  at  the  in‐
       side, upper-left corner.

       The created window is not yet displayed (mapped), call <u>xcb_map_window</u> to display it.

       The created window will initially use the same cursor as its parent.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns an <u>xcb_void_cookie_t</u>. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If  you want to handle errors directly with <u>xcb_request_check</u> instead, use <u>xcb_create_window_checked</u>. See
       <b><a href="../man3/xcb-requests.3.html">xcb-requests</a>(3)</b> for details.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xcb_alloc_error_t</u>
                 The X server could not allocate the requested resources (no memory?).
