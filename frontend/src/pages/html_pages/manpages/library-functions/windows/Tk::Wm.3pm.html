       Tk::Wm - Communicate with window manager

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<u>method</u>(?<u>args</u>?)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>wm</b> methods are used to interact with window managers in order to control such things as the title for
       a window, its geometry, or the increments in terms of which it may be resized.  The <b>wm</b> methods can take
       any of a number of different forms, depending on the particular <u>method</u> argument.  All of the forms expect
       <u>$toplevel</u>, which must be a top-level window object.

       The legal forms for the <b>wm</b> methods are:

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>aspect</b>(?<u>minNumer</u> <u>minDenom</u> <u>maxNumer</u> <u>maxDenom</u>?)
           If  <u>minNumer</u>,  <u>minDenom</u>,  <u>maxNumer</u>,  and  <u>maxDenom</u> are all specified, then they will be passed to the
           window manager and the window manager should use them to enforce a range of acceptable aspect  ratios
           for  <u>$toplevel</u>.   The  aspect  ratio  of  <u>$toplevel</u> (width/length) will be constrained to lie between
           <u>minNumer</u>/<u>minDenom</u> and <u>maxNumer</u>/<u>maxDenom</u>.  If <u>minNumer</u> etc. are all specified as empty  strings,  then
           any  existing aspect ratio restrictions are removed.  If <u>minNumer</u> etc. are specified, then the method
           returns an empty string.  Otherwise, it returns a array  containing  four  elements,  which  are  the
           current  values  of  <u>minNumer</u>,  <u>minDenom</u>,  <u>maxNumer</u>,  and  <u>maxDenom</u> (if no aspect restrictions are in
           effect, then an empty string is returned).

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>attributes</b>( <u>?args?</u> );
           This subcommand returns or  sets  platform  specific  attributes associated with a window.

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>attributes</b>;
               Returns a list of the  platform specific  flags  and  their  values.

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>attributes</b>( <u>?option?</u> );
               Returns  the  value for the specific option.

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>attributes</b>( <u>?option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value...?</u> );
               Sets one or more of the values. The values are as follows:

               On Windows, <b>-disabled</b> gets or sets whether the window is in  a disabled state.  <b>-toolwindow</b>  gets
               or  sets  the  style  of the window to toolwindow (as defined in the MSDN). <b>-topmost</b> gets or sets
               whether this is a topmost window (displays above all other windows).

               On Macintosh, there are currently no special attribute values.

               On Unix, there are currently no special attribute values.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>client</b>(?<u>name</u>?)
           If <u>name</u> is specified, this method stores <u>name</u> (which should be the name of  the  host  on  which  the
           application  is executing) in <u>$toplevel</u>'s <b>WM_CLIENT_MACHINE</b> property for use by the window manager or
           session manager.  The method returns an empty string in this case.   If  <u>name</u>  isn't  specified,  the
           method  returns the last name set in a <b>client</b> method for <u>$toplevel</u>.  If <u>name</u> is specified as an empty
           string, the method deletes the <b>WM_CLIENT_MACHINE</b> property from <u>$toplevel</u>.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>colormapwindows</b>(?<u>windowList</u>?)
           This method is used to manipulate the <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property, which provides information to the
           window managers about windows that have private colormaps.  If <u>windowList</u> isn't specified, the method
           returns a list whose elements are the names of the windows in the <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b>  property.   If
           <u>windowList</u>   is   specified,   it   consists  of  a  list  of  widgets;  the  method  overwrites  the
           <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b>  property  with  the  given  windows  and   returns   an   empty   string.    The
           <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b>  property should normally contain a list of the internal windows within <u>$toplevel</u>
           whose colormaps differ from their parents.  The order of the windows  in  the  property  indicates  a
           priority  order:  the  window  manager will attempt to install as many colormaps as possible from the
           head of this list when <u>$widget</u> gets the colormap focus.  If <u>$widget</u> is not included among the windows
           in <u>windowList</u>, Tk implicitly adds it at the end of the  <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b>  property,  so  that  its
           colormap  is  lowest  in priority.  If <u>$widget</u>-&gt;colormapwindows is not invoked, Tk will automatically
           set the property for each top-level window to all the internal windows whose  colormaps  differ  from
           their  parents,  followed  by  the top-level itself;  the order of the internal windows is undefined.
           See the ICCCM documentation for more information on the <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>command</b>(?<u>value</u>?)
           If <u>value</u> is specified, this method stores <u>value</u> in <u>$toplevel</u>'s <b>WM_COMMAND</b> property  for  use  by  the
           window  manager  or  session  manager  and  returns  an  empty  string.   <u>Value</u> must have proper list
           structure;  the elements should contain the words of the command used to invoke the application.   If
           <u>value</u>  isn't  specified then the method returns the last value set in a <b>command</b> method for <u>$toplevel</u>.
           If <u>value</u> is specified as an empty string, the method deletes the <b>WM_COMMAND</b> property from <u>$toplevel</u>.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>deiconify</b>
           Arrange for <u>$toplevel</u> to be displayed in normal (non-iconified) form.  This is done  by  mapping  the
           window.   If  the  window has never been mapped then this method will not map the window, but it will
           ensure that when the window is first mapped it will be displayed in de-iconified  form.   Returns  an
           empty string.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>focusmodel</b>(?<b>active</b>|<b>passive</b>?)
           If  <b>active</b>  or <b>passive</b> is supplied as an optional argument to the method, then it specifies the focus
           model for <u>$toplevel</u>.  In this case the method returns an empty string.  If no additional argument  is
           supplied, then the method returns the current focus model for <u>$toplevel</u>.  An <b>active</b> focus model means
           that <u>$toplevel</u> will claim the input focus for itself or its descendants, even at times when the focus
           is  currently in some other application.  <b>Passive</b> means that <u>$toplevel</u> will never claim the focus for
           itself:  the window manager should give the focus to <u>$toplevel</u> at appropriate times.   However,  once
           the  focus  has  been given to <u>$toplevel</u> or one of its descendants, the application may re-assign the
           focus among <u>$toplevel</u>'s descendants.  The focus model defaults to  <b>passive</b>,  and  Tk's  <b>focus</b>  method
           assumes a passive model of focusing.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>frame</b>
           If  <u>$widget</u> has been reparented by the window manager into a decorative frame, the method returns the
           platform specific window identifier for the outermost frame that contains <u>$toplevel</u> (the window whose
           parent is the root or virtual root).  If <u>$toplevel</u> hasn't been reparented by the window manager  then
           the method returns the platform specific window identifier for <u>$toplevel</u>.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>geometry</b>(?<u>newGeometry</u>?)
           If  <u>newGeometry</u>  is  specified,  then  the  geometry  of  <u>$toplevel</u> is changed and an empty string is
           returned.  Otherwise the current geometry for <u>$toplevel</u> is returned (this is the most recent geometry
           specified  either  by  manual  resizing  or  in  a  <b>geometry</b>  method).   <u>NewGeometry</u>  has  the   form
           <b>=</b><u>width</u><b>x</b><u>height</u><b>+-</b><u>x</u><b>+-</b><u>y</u>,  where  any  of <b>=</b>, <u>width</u><b>x</b><u>height</u>, or <b>+-</b><u>x</u><b>+-</b><u>y</u> may be omitted.  <u>Width</u> and <u>height</u> are
           positive integers specifying the desired dimensions of  <u>$toplevel</u>.   If  <u>$toplevel</u>  is  gridded  (see
           "GRIDDED GEOMETRY MANAGEMENT" below) then the dimensions are specified in grid units;  otherwise they
           are  specified  in  pixel units.  <u>X</u> and <u>y</u> specify the desired location of <u>$toplevel</u> on the screen, in
           pixels.  If <u>x</u> is preceded by <b>+</b>, it specifies the number of pixels between the left edge of the screen
           and the left edge of <u>$toplevel</u>'s border;  if preceded by <b>-</b> then <u>x</u>  specifies  the  number  of  pixels
           between the right edge of the screen and the right edge of <u>$toplevel</u>'s border.  If <u>y</u> is preceded by <b>+</b>
           then  it  specifies  the  number  of  pixels between the top of the screen and the top of <u>$toplevel</u>'s
           border;  if <u>y</u> is preceded by <b>-</b> then  it  specifies  the  number  of  pixels  between  the  bottom  of
           <u>$toplevel</u>'s border and the bottom of the screen.  If <u>newGeometry</u> is specified as an empty string then
           any  existing  user-specified  geometry for <u>$toplevel</u> is cancelled, and the window will revert to the
           size requested internally by its widgets.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>wmGrid</b>(?<u>baseWidth,baseHeight,widthInc,heightInc</u>?)
           This method indicates that <u>$toplevel</u> is to be managed as a gridded window.   It  also  specifies  the
           relationship between grid units and pixel units.  <u>BaseWidth</u> and <u>baseHeight</u> specify the number of grid
           units   corresponding   to   the   pixel   dimensions   requested   internally   by  <u>$toplevel</u>  using
           <b>Tk_GeometryRequest</b>.  <u>WidthInc</u> and <u>heightInc</u> specify the number  of  pixels  in  each  horizontal  and
           vertical  grid  unit.   These  four  values  determine  a  range  of  acceptable sizes for <u>$toplevel</u>,
           corresponding to grid-based widths and heights that are non-negative integers.   Tk  will  pass  this
           information  to  the  window  manager;   during manual resizing, the window manager will restrict the
           window's size to one of these acceptable sizes.   Furthermore,  during  manual  resizing  the  window
           manager  will  display  the  window's  current  size  in  terms of grid units rather than pixels.  If
           <u>baseWidth</u> etc. are all specified as empty strings, then <u>$toplevel</u> will no  longer  be  managed  as  a
           gridded window.  If <u>baseWidth</u> etc. are specified then the return value is an empty string.  Otherwise
           the  return  value  is  a  array  containing  four  elements  corresponding to the current <u>baseWidth</u>,
           <u>baseHeight</u>, <u>widthInc</u>, and <u>heightInc</u>;  if <u>$toplevel</u> is not currently gridded, then an empty string  is
           returned.  Note: this command should not be needed very often, since the <b>Tk_SetGrid</b> library procedure
           and the <b>-setgrid</b> option provide easier access to the same functionality.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>group</b>(?<u>$widget</u>?)
           If  <u>$widget</u> is specified, it is the the leader of a group of related windows.  The window manager may
           use this information, for example, to unmap all of the windows in a group when the group's leader  is
           iconified.   <u>$widget</u>  may  be  specified  as  an  empty  string  to  remove  <u>$toplevel</u> from any group
           association.  If <u>$widget</u> is specified then the method returns an empty string;  otherwise it  returns
           the <u>$toplevel</u>'s current group leader, or an empty string if <u>$toplevel</u> isn't part of any group.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>iconbitmap</b>(?<u>bitmap</u>?)
           If  <u>bitmap</u>  is  specified,  then  it  names  a  bitmap  in the standard forms accepted by Tk (see the
           <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b> documentation for details).  This <u>black</u> <u>and</u> <u>white</u> bitmap is passed to the window manager
           to be displayed in <u>$toplevel</u>'s icon, and the method returns an empty string.  If an empty  string  is
           specified for <u>bitmap</u>, then any current icon bitmap or image is cancelled for <u>$toplevel</u>.  If <u>bitmap</u> is
           specified then the method returns an empty string.  Otherwise it returns the name of the current icon
           bitmap associated with <u>$toplevel</u>, or an empty string if <u>$toplevel</u> has no icon bitmap.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>iconify</b>
           Arrange  for <u>$toplevel</u> to be iconified.  It <u>$toplevel</u> hasn't yet been mapped for the first time, this
           method will arrange for it to appear in the iconified state when it is eventually mapped.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>iconimage</b>(?<u>image</u>?)
           If <u>image</u> is specified, then it names a normal Tk image.   This  image  is  rendered  into  a  private
           <u>coloured</u>  bitmap  which  is passed to the window manager to be displayed in <u>$toplevel</u>'s icon, and the
           method returns an empty string. If an empty string is specified for  <u>image</u>,  then  any  current  icon
           bitmap  or  image is cancelled for <u>$toplevel</u>.  If <u>image</u> is specified then the method returns an empty
           string.  Otherwise it returns the name of the current icon image associated  with  <u>$toplevel</u>,  or  an
           empty  string  if <u>$toplevel</u> has no icon image.  The private pixmap is not pre-cleared so images which
           are partly "transparent" display rubbish in their transparent parts.

           The sizes of images that can be used as icons in this manner are platform dependent.  On  Win32  this
           sets  the  "large" icon, which should be 32x32, it will automatically be scaled down to 16x16 for use
           as a small icon.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>iconmask</b>(?<u>bitmap</u>?)
           If <u>bitmap</u> is specified, then it names a bitmap  in  the  standard  forms  accepted  by  Tk  (see  the
           <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b> documentation for details).  This bitmap is passed to the window manager to be used as a
           mask in conjunction with the <b>iconbitmap</b> option:  where the mask has zeroes no icon will be displayed;
           where  it has ones, the bits from the icon bitmap will be displayed.  If an empty string is specified
           for <u>bitmap</u> then any current icon mask is cancelled for <u>$toplevel</u> (this is equivalent to specifying  a
           bitmap  of  all ones).  If <u>bitmap</u> is specified then the method returns an empty string.  Otherwise it
           returns the name of the current icon mask associated with <u>$toplevel</u>, or an empty string if no mask is
           in effect.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>iconname</b>(?<u>newName</u>?)
           If <u>newName</u> is specified, then it is passed to the window manager;  the window manager should  display
           <u>newName</u>  inside  the  icon  associated  with  <u>$toplevel</u>.  In this case an empty string is returned as
           result.  If <u>newName</u> isn't specified then the method returns the current icon name for  <u>$toplevel</u>,  or
           an  empty  string  if  no icon name has been specified (in this case the window manager will normally
           display the window's title, as specified with the <b>title</b> method).

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>iconphoto</b>(?-default? <u>image1</u> ?<u>image2</u> ...?)
           Sets the titlebar icon for  window  based  on  the  named  photo images.  If -default  is  specified,
           this  is  applied  to  all  future  created  toplevels as well.  The data in the images is taken as a
           snapshot  at  the  time  of invocation.  If the images are later changed, this is  not  reflected  to
           the  titlebar  icons.   Multiple images  are  accepted to allow different images sizes (eg, 16x16 and
           32x32) to be provided.  The window manager  may  scale  pro- vided icons to an appropriate size.

           On Windows, the images are packed into a Windows icon structure.  This will override an ico specified
           to wm iconbitmap,  and  vice versa. [NOTE: This is not implemented yet!]

           On  X, the images are arranged into the _NET_WM_ICON X property, which most  modern  window  managers
           support.   A  wm  iconbitmap   may  exist   simultaneously.  It is recommended to use not more than 2
           icons, placing the larger icon first.

           On Macintosh, this is currently does nothing.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>iconposition</b>(?<u>x</u> <u>y</u>?)
           If <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are specified, they are passed to the window manager as a hint about where to position the
           icon for <u>$toplevel</u>.  In this case an empty string is returned.  If <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>  are  specified  as  empty
           strings then any existing icon position hint is cancelled.  If neither <u>x</u> nor <u>y</u> is specified, then the
           method  returns a array containing two values, which are the current icon position hints (if no hints
           are in effect then an empty string is returned).

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>iconwindow</b>(?<u>$widget</u>?)
           If <u>$widget</u> is specified, it is a window to use as icon for <u>$toplevel</u>:  when  <u>$toplevel</u>  is  iconified
           then <u>$widget</u> will be mapped to serve as icon, and when <u>$toplevel</u> is de-iconified then <u>$widget</u> will be
           unmapped again.  If <u>$widget</u> is specified as an empty string then any existing icon window association
           for  <u>$toplevel</u>  will  be  cancelled.   If  the  <u>$widget</u> argument is specified then an empty string is
           returned.  Otherwise the method returns the current icon window for <u>$toplevel</u>, or an empty string  if
           there  is  no  icon  window  currently specified for <u>$toplevel</u>.  Button press events are disabled for
           <u>$toplevel</u> as long as it is an icon window;  this is needed in  order  to  allow  window  managers  to
           ``own'' those events.  Note: not all window managers support the notion of an icon window.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>maxsize</b>(?<u>width,height</u>?)
           If  <u>width</u>  and <u>height</u> are specified, they give the maximum permissible dimensions for <u>$toplevel</u>.  For
           gridded windows the dimensions are specified in grid units;  otherwise they are  specified  in  pixel
           units.   The  window  manager will restrict the window's dimensions to be less than or equal to <u>width</u>
           and <u>height</u>.  If <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> are specified, then the method returns an empty  string.   Otherwise
           it  returns  a  array  with two elements, which are the maximum width and height currently in effect.
           The maximum size defaults to the size of  the  screen.   If  resizing  has  been  disabled  with  the
           <b>resizable</b>  method, then this method has no effect.  See the sections on geometry management below for
           more information.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>minsize</b>(?<u>width,height</u>?)
           If <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> are specified, they give the minimum permissible dimensions for  <u>$toplevel</u>.   For
           gridded  windows  the  dimensions are specified in grid units;  otherwise they are specified in pixel
           units.  The window manager will restrict the window's dimensions to be greater than or equal to <u>width</u>
           and <u>height</u>.  If <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> are specified, then the method returns an empty  string.   Otherwise
           it  returns  a  array  with two elements, which are the minimum width and height currently in effect.
           The minimum size defaults to one pixel in each dimension.  If resizing has  been  disabled  with  the
           <b>resizable</b>  method, then this method has no effect.  See the sections on geometry management below for
           more information.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>overrideredirect(?</b><u>boolean</u>?)
           If <u>boolean</u> is specified, it must have a proper  boolean  form  and  the  override-redirect  flag  for
           <u>$toplevel</u>  is  set  to  that  value.  If <u>boolean</u> is not specified then <b>1</b> or <b>0</b> is returned to indicate
           whether or not the override-redirect flag is currently set  for  <u>$toplevel</u>.   Setting  the  override-
           redirect  flag  for a window causes it to be ignored by the window manager;  among other things, this
           means that the window will not be reparented from the root window into a  decorative  frame  and  the
           user will not be able to manipulate the window using the normal window manager mechanisms.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>positionfrom</b>(?<u>who</u>?)
           If  <u>who</u>  is specified, it must be either <b>program</b> or <b>user</b>, or an abbreviation of one of these two.  It
           indicates whether <u>$toplevel</u>'s current position was requested by the program or  by  the  user.   Many
           window  managers ignore program-requested initial positions and ask the user to manually position the
           window;  if <b>user</b> is specified then the window manager should position the window at the  given  place
           without  asking  the  user  for assistance.  If <u>who</u> is specified as an empty string, then the current
           position source is cancelled.  If <u>who</u>  is  specified,  then  the  method  returns  an  empty  string.
           Otherwise  it  returns <b>user</b> or $widget to indicate the source of the window's current position, or an
           empty string if no source has been specified yet.  Most window managers interpret  ``no  source''  as
           equivalent  to <b>program</b>.  Tk will automatically set the position source to <b>user</b> when a <b>geometry</b> method
           is invoked, unless the source has been set explicitly to <b>program</b>.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>protocol</b>(?<u>name</u>?,?<u>callback</u>?)
           This method is used to manage window manager protocols such as <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b>.  <u>Name</u> is the name of
           an atom corresponding to a window manager protocol, such as <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b> or  <b>WM_SAVE_YOURSELF</b>  or
           <b>WM_TAKE_FOCUS</b>.   If  both  <u>name</u>  and  <u>callback</u>  are  specified,  then <u>callback</u> is associated with the
           protocol specified by <u>name</u>.  <u>Name</u> will be added to <u>$toplevel</u>'s  <b>WM_PROTOCOLS</b>  property  to  tell  the
           window  manager that the application has a protocol handler for <u>name</u>, and <u>callback</u> will be invoked in
           the future whenever the window manager sends a message to the client for that protocol.  In this case
           the method returns an empty string.  If <u>name</u> is  specified  but  <u>callback</u>  isn't,  then  the  current
           callback  for  <u>name</u>  is  returned,  or  an  empty string if there is no handler defined for <u>name</u>.  If
           <u>callback</u> is specified as an empty string then the current handler for  <u>name</u>  is  deleted  and  it  is
           removed  from  the  <b>WM_PROTOCOLS</b>  property  on  <u>$toplevel</u>;   an empty string is returned.  Lastly, if
           neither <u>name</u> nor <u>callback</u> is specified, the method returns a list of  all  the  protocols  for  which
           handlers are currently defined for <u>$toplevel</u>.

                   Tk  always defines a protocol handler for <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b>, even if you haven't asked for one
                   with <b>protocol</b>.  If a <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b> message arrives when you  haven't  defined  a  handler,
                   then Tk handles the message by destroying the window for which it was received.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>resizable</b>(?<u>width,height</u>?)
           This  method  controls whether or not the user may interactively resize a top-level window.  If <u>width</u>
           and <u>height</u> are specified, they are boolean values that determine whether  the  width  and  height  of
           <u>$toplevel</u>  may  be  modified by the user.  In this case the method returns an empty string.  If <u>width</u>
           and <u>height</u> are omitted then the method returns a list with two 0/1 elements that indicate whether the
           width and height of <u>$toplevel</u> are currently resizable.  By default, windows  are  resizable  in  both
           dimensions.   If  resizing  is disabled, then the window's size will be the size from the most recent
           interactive resize or <b>geometry</b> method.  If there has been no such operation then the window's natural
           size will be used.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>sizefrom</b>(?<u>who</u>?)
           If <u>who</u> is specified, it must be either <b>program</b> or <b>user</b>, or an abbreviation of one of these  two.   It
           indicates  whether <u>$toplevel</u>'s current size was requested by the program or by the user.  Some window
           managers ignore program-requested sizes and ask the user to manually size the  window;   if  <b>user</b>  is
           specified  then  the window manager should give the window its specified size without asking the user
           for assistance.  If <u>who</u> is specified as an empty string, then the current size source  is  cancelled.
           If  <u>who</u>  is specified, then the method returns an empty string.  Otherwise it returns <b>user</b> or $widget
           to indicate the source of the window's current size, or  an  empty  string  if  no  source  has  been
           specified yet.  Most window managers interpret ``no source'' as equivalent to <b>program</b>.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>stackorder</b>( <u>?isabove|isbelow</u> <u>$toplevel?</u> );
           The  stackorder  command  returns  a list  of  toplevel  windows  in stacking  order,  from lowest to
           highest. When a single toplevel window is passed, the returned list recursively includes all  of  the
           window's   children  that  are  toplevels.  Only  those  toplevels that are currently mapped  to  the
           screen  are  returned.   The stackorder command can also be used to  determine  if  one  toplevel  is
           positioned above or below a second toplevel.  When two window arguments  separated  by either isabove
           or  isbelow are passed, a boolean result indicates whether or not the first window is currently above
           or below the second window in the stacking order.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>state</b>(?<u>newstate</u>?)
           If <u>newstate</u> is specified, the window will be set to the new state, otherwise it returns  the  current
           state  of <u>$toplevel</u>: either <b>normal</b>, <b>iconic</b>, <b>withdrawn</b>, <b>icon</b>, or (Windows only) <b>zoomed</b>. The difference
           between <b>iconic</b> and <b>icon</b> is that <b>iconic</b> refers to a window that has been  iconified  (e.g.,  with  the
           <b>iconify</b>  method)  while  <b>icon</b>  refers to a window whose only purpose is to serve as the icon for some
           other window (via the <b>iconwindow</b> method). The <b>icon</b> state cannot be set.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>title</b>(?<u>string</u>?)
           If <u>string</u> is specified, then it will be passed to the  window  manager  for  use  as  the  title  for
           <u>$toplevel</u> (the window manager should display this string in <u>$toplevel</u>'s title bar).  In this case the
           method  returns an empty string.  If <u>string</u> isn't specified then the method returns the current title
           for the <u>$toplevel</u>.  The title for a window defaults to its name.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>transient</b>(?<u>master</u>?)
           If <u>master</u> is specified, then the window manager is informed that  <u>$toplevel</u>  is  a  transient  window
           (e.g.  pull-down menu) working on behalf of <u>master</u> (where <u>master</u> is a top-level window).  Some window
           managers will use this information to manage <u>$toplevel</u> specially.  If <u>master</u> is specified as an empty
           string then <u>$toplevel</u> is marked as not being a transient window any more.  If  <u>master</u>  is  specified,
           then  the  method returns an empty string.  Otherwise the method returns the path name of <u>$toplevel</u>'s
           current master, or an empty string if <u>$toplevel</u> isn't currently a transient window.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>withdraw</b>
           Arranges for <u>$toplevel</u> to be withdrawn from the screen.  This causes the window to  be  unmapped  and
           forgotten  about by the window manager.  If the window has never been mapped, then this method causes
           the window to be mapped in the withdrawn state.  Not all window managers appear to know how to handle
           windows that are mapped in the withdrawn state.  Note: it sometimes seems to be necessary to withdraw
           a window and then re-map it (e.g. with <b>deiconify</b>) to get some window managers  to  pay  attention  to
           changes in window attributes such as group.

       <u>$toplevel</u>-&gt;<b>wrapper</b>
           Returns a list of two elements: the window id of the wrapper window in which Tk has placed <u>$toplevel</u>,
           and the height of the menu bar. The id is the one by which window manager will know <u>$toplevel</u>, and so
           is  appropriate  place  to  add X properties. The menu height is only returned on X. On Windows, this
           value is always zero.

</pre><h4><b>ICON</b> <b>SIZES</b></h4><pre>
       The sizes of bitmaps/images that can be used as icons in this manner  are  platform  and  window  manager
       dependent.  Unix  window  managers  are  typically more tolerant than Win32. It is possible that coloured
       "iconimage" icons may cause problems on some X window managers.

       •   Win32

           "iconimage" and "iconbitmap" set the "large" icon, which should be 32x32, it  will  automatically  be
           scaled down to 16x16 for use as a small icon.  Win32 ignores "iconwin" requests.

       •   KDE's "kwm"

           Accepts  coloured  "iconimage"  and  black  and  white  "iconbitmap" but will scale either to a small
           (14x14?) icon. Kwm ignores "iconwin".

       •   Sun's "olwm" or "olvwm"

           Honours "iconwin" which will override "iconimage" or "iconbitmap".  Coloured images work.

       •   Sun's CDE window manager

           Coloured images work. ...

</pre><h4><b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b></h4><pre>
       By default a top-level window appears on the screen in its <u>natural</u> <u>size</u>,  which  is  the  one  determined
       internally by its widgets and geometry managers.  If the natural size of a top-level window changes, then
       the  window's  size changes to match.  A top-level window can be given a size other than its natural size
       in two ways.  First, the user can resize the window manually using the facilities of the window  manager,
       such  as  resize  handles.   Second, the application can request a particular size for a top-level window
       using the <b>geometry</b> method.  These two cases are handled identically by Tk;  in either case, the requested
       size overrides the natural size.  You can return the window to its natural by invoking <b>geometry</b>  with  an
       empty <u>geometry</u> string.

       Normally  a  top-level  window  can  have any size from one pixel in each dimension up to the size of its
       screen.  However, you can use the <b>minsize</b> and <b>maxsize</b> methods to limit the range of allowable sizes.  The
       range set by <b>minsize</b> and <b>maxsize</b> applies to all forms of resizing, including the window's natural size as
       well as manual resizes and the <b>geometry</b> method.  You can also use  the  method  <b>resizable</b>  to  completely
       disable interactive resizing in one or both dimensions.

</pre><h4><b>GRIDDED</b> <b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Gridded  geometry  management occurs when one of the widgets of an application supports a range of useful
       sizes.  This occurs, for example, in a text editor where the scrollbars, menus, and other adornments  are
       fixed  in  size  but  the edit widget can support any number of lines of text or characters per line.  In
       this case, it is usually desirable to let the user specify the number of  lines  or  characters-per-line,
       either  with  the  <b>geometry</b>  method or by interactively resizing the window.  In the case of text, and in
       other interesting cases also, only discrete sizes of the window make sense, such as integral  numbers  of
       lines and characters-per-line;  arbitrary pixel sizes are not useful.

       Gridded  geometry  management provides support for this kind of application.  Tk (and the window manager)
       assume that there is a grid of some sort within the  application  and  that  the  application  should  be
       resized  in  terms of <u>grid</u> <u>units</u> rather than pixels.  Gridded geometry management is typically invoked by
       turning on the <b>setGrid</b> option for a widget;  it can also be invoked with the <b>wmGrid</b> method or by  calling
       <b>Tk_SetGrid</b>.  In each of these approaches the particular widget (or sometimes code in the application as a
       whole)  specifies the relationship between integral grid sizes for the window and pixel sizes.  To return
       to non-gridded geometry management, invoke <b>grid</b> with empty argument strings.

       When gridded geometry management is enabled then all the dimensions specified in  <b>minsize</b>,  <b>maxsize</b>,  and
       <b>geometry</b> methods are treated as grid units rather than pixel units.  Interactive resizing is also carried
       out in even numbers of grid units rather than pixels.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Most  existing  window  managers  appear  to  have bugs that affect the operation of the <b>wm</b> methods.  For
       example, some changes won't take effect if the window is already active:  the  window  will  have  to  be
       withdrawn and de-iconified in order to make the change happen.
