</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  X  Window  System  provides support for changing the image on a display screen after a user-settable
       period of inactivity to avoid burning the  cathode  ray  tube  phosphors.   However,  no  interfaces  are
       provided  for  the  user  to control the image that is drawn.  This extension allows an external ``screen
       saver'' client to detect when the alternate image is to be displayed and to provide the graphics.

       Current X server implementations  typically  provide  at  least  one  form  of  ``screen  saver''  image.
       Historically,  this  has  been  a copy of the X logo drawn against the root background pattern.  However,
       many users have asked for the mechanism to allow  them  to  write  screen  saver  programs  that  provide
       capabilities  similar to those provided by other window systems.  In particular, such users often wish to
       be able to display corporate logos, instructions on how to reactivate the screen, and  automatic  screen-
       locking utilities.  This extension provides a means for writing such clients.

   <b>Assumptions</b>
       This extension exports the notion of a special screen saver window that is mapped above all other windows
       on  a  display.   This  window  has  the  <u>override-redirect</u>  attribute  set  so that it is not subject to
       manipulation by the window manager.  Furthermore, the X identifier for the window is  never  returned  by
       <b>QueryTree</b> requests on the root window, so it is typically not visible to other clients.

       <b>XScreenSaverQueryExtension</b>  returns <b>True</b> if the <u>XScreenSaver</u> extension is available on the given display.
       A client must call <b>XScreenSaverQueryExtension</b> before calling any other XScreenSaver function in order  to
       negotiate  a  compatible protocol version; otherwise the client will get undefined behavior (XScreenSaver
       may or may not work).

       If the extension is supported, the event number for <u>ScreenSaverNotify</u> events is  returned  in  the  value
       pointed  to  by  <u>event_base</u>.   Since  no  additional errors are defined by this extension, the results of
       <u>error_base</u> are not defined.

       <b>XScreenSaverQueryVersion</b> returns <b>True</b> if the request  succeeded;  the  values  of  the  major  and  minor
       protocol versions supported by the server are returned in <u>major_version_return</u> and <u>minor_version_return</u> <u>.</u>

       <b>XScreenSaverAllocInfo</b>   allocates  and  returns  an  <b>XScreenSaverInfo</b>  structure  for  use  in  calls  to
       <b>XScreenSaverQueryInfo</b>.  All fields in the structure are initialized to zero.  If insufficient  memory  is
       available, NULL is returned.  The results of this routine can be released using <u>XFree</u>.

       <b>XScreenSaverQueryInfo</b>  returns information about the current state of the screen server in <u>saver_info</u> and
       a non-zero value is returned.  If the extension is not supported, <u>saver_info</u> is  not  changed  and  0  is
       returned.

       The  <u>state</u>  field  specifies whether or not the screen saver is currently active and how the <u>til-or-since</u>
       value should be interpreted:

       <u>Off</u> The screen is not currently being saved; <u>til-or-since</u> specifies the number of milliseconds until  the
           screen saver is expected to activate.

       <u>On</u>  The  screen  is  currently  being  saved; <u>til-or-since</u> specifies the number of milliseconds since the
           screen saver activated.

       <u>Disabled</u>
           The screen saver is currently disabled; <u>til-or-since</u> is zero.

       The <u>kind</u> field specifies the mechanism that either is currently being used or would have  been  were  the
       screen being saved:

       <u>Blanked</u>
           The video signal to the display monitor was disabled.

       <u>Internal</u>
           A  server-dependent,  built-in  screen saver image was displayed; either no client had set the screen
           saver window attributes or a different client had the server grabbed when the screen saver activated.

       <u>External</u>
           The screen saver window was mapped with attributes set by a client using the <b>ScreenSaverSetAttributes</b>
           request.

       The <u>idle</u> field specifies the number of milliseconds since the last input was received from  the  user  on
       any of the input devices.
       The  <u>event-mask</u>  field  specifies  which,  if  any,  screen  saver events this client has requested using
       <b>ScreenSaverSelectInput</b>.

       <b>XScreenSaverSelectInput</b> asks that events related to the screen saver be generated for this client.  If no
       bits are set in <u>event-mask</u>, then no  events  will  be  generated.   Otherwise,  any  combination  of  the
       following bits may be set:

       <b>ScreenSaverNotify</b>
               If this bit is set, <b>ScreenSaverNotify</b> events are generated whenever the screen saver is activated
               or deactivated.

       <b>ScreenSaverCycle</b>
               If  this  bit  is  set,  <b>ScreenSaverNotify</b>  events  are generated whenever the screen saver cycle
               interval passes.

       <b>XScreenSaverSetAttributes</b> sets the attributes to be used the next  time  the  external  screen  saver  is
       activated.   If  another  client currently has the attributes set, a BadAccess error is generated and the
       request is ignored.
       Otherwise, the specified window attributes are checked as if  they  were  used  in  a  core  <b>CreateWindow</b>
       request  whose  parent  is  the  root.  The <u>override-redirect</u> field is ignored as it is implicitly set to
       True.  If the window attributes result in an error according to the rules for <b>CreateWindow</b>,  the  request
       is ignored.
       Otherwise,  the  attributes  are  stored and will take effect on the next activation that occurs when the
       server is not grabbed by another client.  Any resources specified for  the  <u>background-pixmap</u>  or  <u>cursor</u>
       attributes  may  be  freed  immediately.   The  server  is  free  to copy the <u>background-pixmap</u> or <u>cursor</u>
       resources or to use them in place; therefore, the effect of changing the contents of those  resources  is
       undefined.   If  the  specified  <u>colormap</u>  no longer exists when the screen saver activates, the parent's
       colormap is used instead.  If no errors are generated by this request, any previous screen  saver  window
       attributes set by this client are released.
       When  the  screen  saver next activates and the server is not grabbed by another client, the screen saver
       window is created, if necessary, and set to the specified attributes and events are generated  as  usual.
       The  colormap  associated with the screen saver window is installed.  Finally, the screen saver window is
       mapped.
       The window remains mapped and at the top of the stacking order until the screen saver is  deactivated  in
       response  to activity on any of the user input devices, a <b>ForceScreenSaver</b> request with a value of Reset,
       or any request that would cause the window to be unmapped.
       If the screen saver activates while the server is grabbed by another client, the internal saver mechanism
       is used.  The <b>ForceScreenSaver</b> request may be used with a value of  Active  to  deactivate  the  internal
       saver and activate the external saver.
       If  the  screen saver client's connection to the server is broken while the screen saver is activated and
       the client's close down mode has not been RetainPermanent or RetainTemporary, the current screen saver is
       deactivated and the internal screen saver is immediately activated.
       When the screen saver deactivates, the screen saver window's colormap is uninstalled and  the  window  is
       unmapped  (except  as  described  below).   The screen saver XID is disassociated with the window and the
       server may, but is not required to, destroy the window along with any children.
       When the screen saver is being deactivated and then  immediately  reactivated  (such  as  when  switching
       screen  savers),  the  server  may  leave  the  screen saver window mapped (typically to avoid generating
       exposures).

       <b>XScreenSaverUnsetAttributes</b> instructs the server to discard any previous screen saver  window  attributes
       set by this client.

       <b>XScreenSaverRegister</b>  stores  the  given  <u>XID</u> in the <b>_SCREEN_SAVER_ID</b> property (of the given <u>type</u>) on the
       root window of the specified <u>screen</u>.  It returns zero if an error is encountered and the property is  not
       changed, otherwise it returns non-zero.

       <b>XScreenSaverUnregister</b>  removes  any  <b>_SCREEN_SAVER_ID</b>  from the root window of the specified <u>screen</u>.  It
       returns zero if an error is encountered and the property is changed, otherwise it returns non-zero.

       <b>XScreenSaverGetRegistered</b> returns the <u>XID</u> and <u>type</u> stored in the <b>_SCREEN_SAVER_ID</b> property  on  the  root
       window  of  the specified <u>screen</u>.  It returns zero if an error is encountered or if the property does not
       exist or is not of the correct format; otherwise it returns non-zero.

       <b>XScreenSaverSuspend</b> temporarily suspends the screensaver  and  DPMS  timer  if  <u>suspend</u>  is  'True',  and
       restarts the timer if <u>suspend</u> is 'False'.
       This  function should be used by applications that don't want the screensaver or DPMS to become activated
       while they're for example in the process of playing a  media  sequence,  or  are  otherwise  continuously
       presenting visual information to the user while in a non-interactive state. This function is not intended
       to be called by an external screensaver application.
       If  <b>XScreenSaverSuspend</b>  is  called multiple times with <u>suspend</u> set to 'True', it must be called an equal
       number of times with <u>suspend</u> set to 'False' in order for the screensaver  timer  to  be  restarted.  This
       request  has  no  affect  if  a client tries to resume the screensaver without first having suspended it.
       <b>XScreenSaverSuspend</b> can thus not be used by one client to resume the screensaver if it's  been  suspended
       by another client.
       If  a  client  that has suspended the screensaver becomes disconnected from the X server, the screensaver
       timer will automatically be restarted, unless it's still suspended  by  another  client.  Suspending  the
       screensaver   timer   doesn't   prevent   the   screensaver  from  being  forceably  activated  with  the
       <b>ForceScreenSaver</b> request, or a DPMS mode from being set with the <b>DPMSForceLevel</b> request.
       <b>XScreenSaverSuspend</b> also doesn't deactivate the screensaver or DPMS if either is active at the  time  the
       request  to  suspend  them  is  received  by  the X server. But once they've been deactivated, they won't
       automatically be activated again, until the client has canceled the suspension.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XScreenSaverSelectInput,</b> <b>XScreenSaverQueryInfo,</b> <b>XScreenSaverSetAttributes</b> and <b>XScreenSaverUnsetAttributes</b>
       will generate a <u>BadDrawable</u> error if <u>drawable</u> is not a valid drawable identifier.  If any undefined  bits
       are set in <u>event-mask</u>, a BadValue error is generated by <b>XScreenSaverSelectInput</b> <b>.</b>

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XScreenSaverSuspend</b>  is  available  in  version  1.1  and later versions of the X Screen Saver Extension.
