       Tcl_Interp <u>*interp</u> (out)           Interpreter to use for error reporting.

       const char <u>*pathName</u> (in)          Character string containing path name of window.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Each window managed by Tk has two names, a short name that identifies a window among children of the same
       parent,  and  a path name that identifies the window uniquely among all the windows belonging to the same
       main window.  The path name is used more often in Tk than the short  name;   many  commands,  like  <b>bind</b>,
       expect path names as arguments.

       The  <b>Tk_Name</b>  macro  returns  a  window's  short  name,  which is the same as the <u>name</u> argument passed to
       <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b> when the window was created.  The value is returned as a Tk_Uid, which may be  used  just
       like  a  string  pointer  but  also  has  the properties of a unique identifier (see the manual entry for
       <b>Tk_GetUid</b> for details).

       The <b>Tk_PathName</b> macro returns a hierarchical name for <u>tkwin</u>.  Path names have a structure similar to file
       names in Unix but with dots between elements instead of slashes:  the main window for an application  has
       the path name “.”; its children have names like “.a” and “.b”; their children have names like “.a.aa” and
       “.b.bb”;  and  so  on.  A window is considered to be a child of another window for naming purposes if the
       second window was named as the first window's <u>parent</u> when the first window  was  created.   This  is  not
       always  the  same  as  the  X  window hierarchy.  For example, a pop-up is created as a child of the root
       window, but its logical parent will usually be a window within the application.

       The procedure <b>Tk_NameToWindow</b> returns the token for a window given its path name (the <u>pathName</u>  argument)
       and  another window belonging to the same main window (<u>tkwin</u>).  It normally returns a token for the named
       window, but if no such window exists <b>Tk_NameToWindow</b> leaves an  error  message  in  interpreter  <u>interp</u>'s
       result  and  returns  NULL.   The <u>tkwin</u> argument to <b>Tk_NameToWindow</b> is needed because path names are only
       unique within a single application hierarchy.  If, for example, a single  process  has  opened  two  main
       windows,  each  will  have a separate naming hierarchy and the same path name might appear in each of the
       hierarchies.  Normally <u>tkwin</u> is the main window of the desired hierarchy, but this need not be the  case:
       any window in the desired hierarchy may be used.
