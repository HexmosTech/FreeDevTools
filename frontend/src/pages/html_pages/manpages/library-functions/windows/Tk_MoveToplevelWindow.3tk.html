       Tk_Window <u>tkwin</u> (in)          Token for top-level window to move.

       int <u>x</u> (in)                    New  x-coordinate for the top-left pixel of <u>tkwin</u>'s border, or the top-left
                                     pixel of the decorative border supplied for <u>tkwin</u> by the window manager, if
                                     there is one.

       int <u>y</u> (in)                    New y-coordinate for the top-left pixel of <u>tkwin</u>'s border, or the  top-left

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In  general, a window should never set its own position;  this should be done only by the geometry manger
       that is responsible for the window.  For top-level windows the window manager is effectively the geometry
       manager;  Tk provides interface code between the  application  and  the  window  manager  to  convey  the
       application's desires to the geometry manager.  The desired size for a top-level window is conveyed using
       the  usual  <b>Tk_GeometryRequest</b>  mechanism.   The  procedure  <b>Tk_MoveToplevelWindow</b>  may  be  used  by  an
       application to request a particular position for a  top-level  window;   this  procedure  is  similar  in
       function  to the <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> Tcl command except that negative offsets cannot be specified.  It is invoked
       by widgets such as menus that want to appear at a particular place on the screen.

       When <b>Tk_MoveToplevelWindow</b> is called it does not immediately pass on the  new  desired  location  to  the
       window  manager;   it  defers  this action until all other outstanding work has been completed, using the
       <b>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</b> mechanism.
