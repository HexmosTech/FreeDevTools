       XMapWindow, XMapRaised, XMapSubwindows - map windows

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>

       int XMapWindow(Display *<u>display</u>, Window <u>w</u>);

       int XMapRaised(Display *<u>display</u>, Window <u>w</u>);

       int XMapSubwindows(Display *<u>display</u>, Window <u>w</u>);

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>display</u>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <u>w</u>         Specifies the window.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>XMapWindow</b> function maps the window and all of its subwindows that have had map requests.  Mapping a
       window that has an unmapped ancestor does not display the window but marks it  as  eligible  for  display
       when  the  ancestor  becomes  mapped.   Such  a  window is called unviewable.  When all its ancestors are
       mapped, the window becomes viewable and will be visible on the screen if it is not  obscured  by  another
       window.  This function has no effect if the window is already mapped.

       If   the   override-redirect   of   the   window   is  <b>False</b>  and  if  some  other  client  has  selected
       <b>SubstructureRedirectMask</b> on the parent window, then the X server generates a <b>MapRequest</b>  event,  and  the
       <b>XMapWindow</b> function does not map the window.  Otherwise, the window is mapped, and the X server generates
       a <b>MapNotify</b> event.

       If  the  window  becomes  viewable  and no earlier contents for it are remembered, the X server tiles the
       window with its background.  If the window's background is undefined, the existing  screen  contents  are
       not  altered,  and  the  X  server generates zero or more <b>Expose</b> events.  If backing-store was maintained
       while the window was unmapped, no <b>Expose</b> events are generated.  If backing-store will now be  maintained,
       a  full-window  exposure  is always generated.  Otherwise, only visible regions may be reported.  Similar
       tiling and exposure take place for any newly viewable inferiors.

       If the window is an <b>InputOutput</b> window, <b>XMapWindow</b> generates <b>Expose</b> events  on  each  <b>InputOutput</b>  window
       that  it  causes  to  be  displayed.   If  the client maps and paints the window and if the client begins
       processing events, the window is painted twice.  To avoid this, first ask for <b>Expose</b> events and then  map
       the  window,  so the client processes input events as usual.  The event list will include <b>Expose</b> for each
       window that has appeared on the screen.  The client's normal response to an <b>Expose</b>  event  should  be  to
       repaint  the window.  This method usually leads to simpler programs and to proper interaction with window
       managers.

       <b>XMapWindow</b> can generate a <b>BadWindow</b> error.

       The <b>XMapRaised</b> function essentially is similar to <b>XMapWindow</b> in that it maps the window and  all  of  its
       subwindows  that  have  had map requests.  However, it also raises the specified window to the top of the
       stack.

       <b>XMapRaised</b> can generate a <b>BadWindow</b> error.

       The <b>XMapSubwindows</b> function maps all subwindows for a specified window in top-to-bottom  stacking  order.
       The  X  server  generates  <b>Expose</b> events on each newly displayed window.  This may be much more efficient
       than mapping many windows one at a time because the server needs to perform much of the work  only  once,
       for all of the windows, rather than for each window.

       <b>XMapSubwindows</b> can generate a <b>BadWindow</b> error.

       <b>BadWindow</b> A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
