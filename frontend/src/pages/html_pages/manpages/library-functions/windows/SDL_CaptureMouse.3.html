</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_CaptureMouse - Capture the mouse and to track input outside an SDL window.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;SDL3/SDL_mouse.h&gt;</b>

       <b>bool</b> <b>SDL_CaptureMouse(bool</b> <b>enabled);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Capturing  enables  your app to obtain mouse events globally, instead of just within your window. Not all
       video targets support this function. When capturing is enabled, the current window  will  get  all  mouse
       events,  but  unlike  relative  mode,  no  change  is made to the cursor and it is not restrained to your
       window.

       This function may also deny mouse input to other windows--both those in your application  and  others  on
       the  system--so  you should use this function sparingly, and in small bursts. For example, you might want
       to track the mouse while the user is dragging something, until the user releases a mouse  button.  It  is
       not  recommended that you capture the mouse for long periods of time, such as the entire time your app is
       running. For that, you should probably use <b>SDL_SetWindowRelativeMouseMode</b>() or  <b>SDL_SetWindowMouseGrab</b>(),
       depending on your goals.

       While  captured,  mouse  events still report coordinates relative to the current (foreground) window, but
       those coordinates may be outside the bounds of the window (including negative values). Capturing is  only
       allowed  for  the  foreground  window.  If  the  window  loses focus while capturing, the capture will be
       disabled automatically.

       While capturing is enabled, the current window will have the <b>SDL_WINDOW_MOUSE_CAPTURE</b> flag set.

       Please note that SDL will attempt to "auto capture" the mouse while the user is pressing a  button;  this
       is  to  try and make mouse behavior more consistent between platforms, and deal with the common case of a
       user dragging the mouse outside of the window. This means that if you are calling <b>SDL_CaptureMouse</b>() only
       to deal with this situation, you do not have to (although it is safe to do so). If this  causes  problems
       for your app, you can disable auto capture by setting the <b>SDL_HINT_MOUSE_AUTO_CAPTURE</b> hint to zero.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>enabled</u>
              true to enable capturing, false to disable.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       for more information.

</pre><h4><b>THREAD</b> <b>SAFETY</b></h4><pre>
       This function should only be called on the main thread.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
