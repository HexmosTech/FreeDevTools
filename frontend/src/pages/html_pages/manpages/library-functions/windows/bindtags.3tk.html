       bindtags - Determine which bindings apply to a window, and order of evaluation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bindtags</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>tagList</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When a binding is created with the <b>bind</b> command, it is associated either with a particular window such as
       <b>.a.b.c</b>, a class name such as <b>Button</b>, the keyword <b>all</b>, or any other string.  All of these forms are called
       <u>binding</u>  <u>tags</u>.   Each  window contains a list of binding tags that determine how events are processed for
       the window.  When an event occurs in a window, it is applied to each of the window's tags in order:   for
       each  tag,  the  most  specific  binding  that matches the given tag and event is executed.  See the <b>bind</b>
       command for more information on the matching process.

       By default, each window has four binding tags consisting of the name of the window,  the  window's  class
       name,  the name of the window's nearest toplevel ancestor, and <b>all</b>, in that order.  Toplevel windows have
       only three tags by default, since the toplevel name is the same as that  of  the  window.   The  <b>bindtags</b>
       command allows the binding tags for a window to be read and modified.

       If  <b>bindtags</b>  is  invoked  with  only  one  argument,  then the current set of binding tags for <u>window</u> is
       returned as a list.  If the <u>tagList</u> argument is specified to <b>bindtags</b>, then it must be a proper list; the
       tags for <u>window</u> are changed to the elements of the list.   The  elements  of  <u>tagList</u>  may  be  arbitrary
       strings;   however, any tag starting with a dot is treated as the name of a window;  if no window by that
       name exists at the time an event is processed, then the tag is ignored for that event.  The order of  the
       elements  in  <u>tagList</u>  determines  the order in which binding scripts are executed in response to events.
       For example, the command
              <b>bindtags</b> <b>.b</b> <b>{all</b> <b>.</b> <b>Button</b> <b>.b}</b>
       reverses the order in which binding scripts will be evaluated for a button named <b>.b</b> so that <b>all</b>  bindings
       are invoked first, following by bindings for <b>.b</b>'s toplevel (“.”), followed by class bindings, followed by
       bindings  for  <b>.b</b>.   If  <u>tagList</u>  is  an  empty list then the binding tags for <u>window</u> are returned to the
       default state described above.

       The <b>bindtags</b> command may be used to introduce arbitrary additional binding  tags  for  a  window,  or  to
       remove standard tags.  For example, the command
              <b>bindtags</b> <b>.b</b> <b>{.b</b> <b>TrickyButton</b> <b>.</b> <b>all}</b>
       replaces  the  <b>Button</b>  tag  for  <b>.b</b>  with  <b>TrickyButton</b>.  This means that the default widget bindings for
       buttons, which are associated with the <b>Button</b>  tag,  will  no  longer  apply  to  <b>.b</b>,  but  any  bindings
       associated with <b>TrickyButton</b> (perhaps some new button behavior) will apply.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  have  a  set  of  nested  <b>frame</b>  widgets  and you want events sent to a <b>button</b> widget to also be
       delivered to all the widgets up to the current <b>toplevel</b> (in contrast  to  Tk's  default  behavior,  where
       events  are  not delivered to those intermediate windows) to make it easier to have accelerators that are
       only active for part of a window, you could use a helper procedure like this to help set things up:
              proc setupBindtagsForTreeDelivery {widget} {
                  set tags [list $widget [winfo class $widget]]
                  set w $widget
                  set t [winfo toplevel $w]
                  while {$w ne $t} {
                      set w [winfo parent $w]
                      lappend tags $w
                  }
                  lappend tags all
                  <b>bindtags</b> $widget $tags
              }
