</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_HINT_VIDEO_SYNC_WINDOW_OPERATIONS  -  A variable controlling whether all window operations will block
       until complete.

</pre><h4><b>HEADER</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints.h

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>"SDL3/SDL.h"</b>

       <b>#define</b> <b>SDL_HINT_VIDEO_SYNC_WINDOW_OPERATIONS</b> <u>SDL_VIDEO_SYNC_WINDOW_OPERATIONS"</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Window systems that run asynchronously may not have the results of window operations that resize or  move
       the  window  applied immediately upon the return of the requesting function. Setting this hint will cause
       such operations to block after every call until the pending operation has completed. Setting this to  '1'
       is the equivalent of calling

       <b>SDL_SyncWindow</b> () after every function call.

       Be  aware that amount of time spent blocking while waiting for window operations to complete can be quite
       lengthy, as animations may have to complete, which can take upwards of multiple seconds in some cases.

       The variable can be set to the following values:

       • "0": Window operations are non-blocking. (default)

       • "1": Window operations will block until completed.

       This hint can be set anytime.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This hint is available since SDL 3.2.0.
