       File::MMagic - Guess file type

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use File::MMagic;
         use FileHandle;

         $mm = new File::MMagic; # use internal magic file
         # $mm = File::MMagic-&gt;new('<a href="file:/etc/magic">/etc/magic</a>'); # use external magic file
         # $mm = File::MMagic-&gt;new('/usr/share/etc/magic'); # if you use Debian
         $res = $mm-&gt;checktype_filename("/somewhere/unknown/file");

         $fh = new FileHandle "&lt; /somewhere/unknown/file2";
         $res = $mm-&gt;checktype_filehandle($fh);

         $fh-&gt;read($data, 0x8564);
         $res = $mm-&gt;checktype_contents($data);

</pre><h4><b>ABSTRACT</b></h4><pre>
       This perl library uses perl5 objects to guess file type from filename and/or filehandle.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>checktype_filename()</b>, <b>checktype_filehandle()</b> and checktype_contents returns string contains file type
       with MIME mediatype format.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       File::MMagic-&gt;<b>new()</b>
       File::MMagic-&gt;new( $filename )
           Initializes the module. If no filename is given, the magic numbers stored in File::MMagic are used.

       $mm-&gt;addSpecials
           If  a  filetype  cannot  be determined by magic numbers, extra checks are done based on extra regular
           expressions which can be defined here. The first argument  should  be  the  filetype,  the  remaining
           arguments should be one or more regular expressions.

           By default, checks are done for message/news, message/rfc822, text/html, text/x-roff.

       $mm-&gt;removeSpecials
           Removes  special  regular  expressions. Specify one or more filetypes. If no filetypes are specified,
           all special regexps are removed.

           Returns a hash containing the removed entries.

       $mm-&gt;addFileExts
           If a filetype cannot be determined by magic numbers, extra checks can  be  done  based  on  the  file
           extension  (actually,  a  regexp).  Two  arguments  should  be  geiven:  the filename pattern and the
           corresponding filetype.

           By default, checks are  done  for  application/x-compress,  application/x-bzip2,  application/x-gzip,
           text/html, text/plain

       $mm-&gt;removeFileExts
           Remove  filename  pattern  checks.  Specify one or more patterns. If no pattern is specified, all are
           removed.

           Returns a hash containing the removed entries.

       $mm-&gt;addMagicEntry
           Add a new magic entry in the object. The format is same as <b><a href="../man5/magic.5.html">magic</a></b>(5) file.

             Ex.
             # Add a entry
             $mm-&gt;addMagicEntry("0\tstring\tabc\ttext/abc");
             # Add a entry with a sub entry
             $mm-&gt;addMagicEntry("0\tstring\tdef\t");
             $mm-&gt;addMagicEntry("&gt;10\tstring\tghi\ttext/ghi");

       $mm-&gt;readMagicHandle
       $mm-&gt;checktype_filename
       $mm-&gt;checktype_magic
       $mm-&gt;checktype_contents

       I  read some of Ian F. Darwin's BSD C implementation, to try to determine how some of this was done since
       the specification is a little vague.  I don't believe that this perl version could  be  construed  as  an
       "altered  version",  but  I  did grab the tokens for identifying the hard-coded file types in names.h and
       copied some of the man page.
