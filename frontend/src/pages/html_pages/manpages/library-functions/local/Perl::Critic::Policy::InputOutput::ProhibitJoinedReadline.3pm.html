</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::InputOutput::ProhibitJoinedReadline - Use "local $/ = undef" or Path::Tiny instead
       of joined readline.

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is part of the core Perl::Critic distribution.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       It's really easy to slurp a whole filehandle in at once with "join q{}, &lt;$fh"&gt;, but that's inefficient --
       Perl goes to the trouble of splitting the file into lines only to have that work thrown away.

       To save performance, either slurp the filehandle without splitting like so:

         do { local $/ = undef; &lt;$fh&gt; }

       or use Path::Tiny, which is even faster.

       <b>Note</b> that if the "ProhibitPunctuationVars" policy is also in effect, it will complain about the use of $/
       in the line above.  In that case, write this instead:

         use English '-no_match_vars';

         do { local $INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR = undef; &lt;$fh&gt; };

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is not configurable except for the standard options.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Due to a bug in the current version of PPI (v1.119_03) and earlier, the readline operator is often
       misinterpreted as less-than and greater-than operators after a comma.  Therefore, this policy only works
       well on the empty filehandle, "&lt;&gt;".  When PPI is fixed, this should just start working.

</pre><h4><b>CREDITS</b></h4><pre>
       Initial development of this policy was supported by a grant from the Perl Foundation.
