       dlm_unlock - unlock a DLM lock

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;libdlm.h&gt;

       int dlm_unlock(uint32_t lkid,
                      uint32_t flags, struct dlm_lksb *lksb, void *astarg);

       int dlm_unlock_wait(uint32_t lkid,
                           uint32_t flags, struct dlm_lksb *lksb);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dlm_unlock()</b> unlocks a lock previously acquired by dlm_lock and its variants.

       Unless  <b>dlm_unlock_wait()</b>  is  used  unlocks  are  also  asynchronous. The AST routine is called when the
       resource is successfully unlocked (see below).

       <b>lkid</b> Lock ID as returned in the lksb

       <b>flags</b> flags affecting the unlock operation:
         LKF_CANCEL       Cancel a pending lock or conversion.
                          This returns the lock to it's previously
                          granted mode (in case of a conversion) or
                          unlocks it (in case of a waiting lock).
         LKF_IVVALBLK     Invalidate value block
         LKF_FORCEUNLOCK  Unlock the lock even if it's waiting.

       <b>lksb</b> LKSB to return status and value block information.

       <b>astarg</b> New parameter to be passed to the  completion  AST.   The  completion  AST  routine  is  the  last
       completion  AST routine specified in a dlm_lock call.  If dlm_lock_wait() was the last routine to issue a
       lock, dlm_unlock_wait() must be used to release the lock. If dlm_lock() was the last routine to  issue  a
       lock then either dlm_unlock() or dlm_unlock_wait() may be called.

   <b>Return</b> <b>values</b>
       0  is  returned if the call completed successfully. If not, -1 is returned and errno is set to one of the
       following:

       EINVAL          An invalid parameter was passed to the call (eg bad
                       lock mode or flag)
       EINPROGRESS     The lock is already being unlocked
       EBUSY           The lock is currently being locked or converted
       ENOTEMPTY       An attempt to made to unlock a parent lock that still has
                       child locks.
       ECANCEL         A lock conversion was successfully cancelled
       EUNLOCK         An unlock operation completed successfully
                       (sb_status only)
       EFAULT          The userland buffer could not be read/written by the
                       kernel
       If an error is returned in the AST, then lksb.sb_status is set to the one of the above numbers instead of
       zero.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       int status;
       struct dlm_lksb lksb;

       status = dlm_lock_wait(LKM_EXMODE,
                              &amp;lksb,
                              LKF_NOQUEUE,
                              "MyLock",
                              strlen("MyLock"),
                              0,     // Parent,
                              NULL,  // bast arg
                              NULL,  // bast routine,
                              NULL); // Range

       if (status == 0)
            dlm_unlock_wait(lksb.sb_lkid, 0, &amp;lksb);
