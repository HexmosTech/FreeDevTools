</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock — lock a read-write lock for writing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</a>&gt;
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/time.h">time.h</a>&gt;

       int pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *restrict <u>rwlock</u>,
           const struct timespec *restrict <u>abstime</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</u>()  function shall apply a write lock to the read-write lock referenced by
       <u>rwlock</u> as in the <u>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</u>() function. However,  if  the  lock  cannot  be  acquired  without
       waiting  for  other  threads to unlock the lock, this wait shall be terminated when the specified timeout
       expires. The timeout shall expire when the absolute time specified by <u>abstime</u> passes, as measured by  the
       clock  on  which timeouts are based (that is, when the value of that clock equals or exceeds <u>abstime</u>), or
       if the absolute time specified by <u>abstime</u> has already been passed at the time of the call.

       The timeout shall be based on the CLOCK_REALTIME clock.  The resolution  of  the  timeout  shall  be  the
       resolution  of  the CLOCK_REALTIME clock. The <b>timespec</b> data type is defined in the <u>&lt;time.h&gt;</u> header. Under
       no circumstances shall the function fail with a timeout if the lock  can  be  acquired  immediately.  The
       validity of the <u>abstime</u> parameter need not be checked if the lock can be immediately acquired.

       If  a signal that causes a signal handler to be executed is delivered to a thread blocked on a read-write
       lock via a call to <u>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</u>(), upon return from the signal  handler  the  thread  shall
       resume waiting for the lock as if it was not interrupted.

       The calling thread may deadlock if at the time the call is made it holds the read-write lock. The results
       are undefined if this function is called with an uninitialized read-write lock.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</u>()  function  shall  return zero if the lock for writing on the read-write
       lock object referenced by <u>rwlock</u> is acquired. Otherwise, an error number shall be  returned  to  indicate
       the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>
              The lock could not be acquired before the specified timeout expired.

       The <u>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EDEADLK</b>
              A deadlock condition was detected or the calling thread already holds the <u>rwlock</u>.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The <u>abstime</u> nanosecond value is less than zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million.

       This function shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Applications  using  this  function  may  be  subject  to  priority  inversion,  as discussed in the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>3.291</u>, <u>Priority</u> <u>Inversion</u>.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       If   an   implementation   detects   that   the   value   specified   by   the   <u>rwlock</u>    argument    to
       <u>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</u>()  does  not refer to an initialized read-write lock object, it is recommended
       that the function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL]</b> error.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
