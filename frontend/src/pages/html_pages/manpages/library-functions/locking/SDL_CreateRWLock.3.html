</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_CreateRWLock - Create a new read/write lock.

</pre><h4><b>HEADER</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Defined in SDL3/SDL_mutex.h

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>"SDL3/SDL.h"</b>

       <b>SDL_RWLock</b> <b>*</b> <b>SDL_CreateRWLock(void);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  read/write  lock  is useful for situations where you have multiple threads trying to access a resource
       that is rarely updated. All threads requesting a read-only lock will be allowed to run in parallel; if  a
       thread  requests  a  write  lock,  it  will be provided exclusive access. This makes it safe for multiple
       threads to use a resource at the same time if they promise not to change  it,  and  when  it  has  to  be
       changed, the rwlock will serve as a gateway to make sure those changes can be made safely.

       In  the  right  situation,  a  rwlock can be more efficient than a mutex, which only lets a single thread
       proceed at a time, even if it won't be modifying the data.

       All newly-created read/write locks begin in the _unlocked_ state.

       Calls to <b>SDL_LockRWLockForReading</b> () and

       <b>SDL_LockRWLockForWriting</b>
        will not return while the rwlock is locked _for writing_ by another thread. See

       <b>SDL_TryLockRWLockForReading</b> () and

       <b>SDL_TryLockRWLockForWriting</b> () to attempt to lock without blocking.

       SDL read/write locks are only recursive for read-only locks! They are  not  guaranteed  to  be  fair,  or
       provide  access in a FIFO manner! They are not guaranteed to favor writers. You may not lock a rwlock for
       both read-only and write access at the same time from the same thread (so you can't  promote  your  read-
       only lock to a write lock without unlocking first).

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       ( <b>SDL_RWLock</b>
        *)  Returns  the  initialized  and unlocked read/write lock or NULL on failure; call <b>SDL_GetError</b> () for
       more information.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
