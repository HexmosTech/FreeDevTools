</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_LockRWLockForReading - Lock the read/write lock for _read only_ operations.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;SDL3/SDL_mutex.h&gt;</b>

       <b>void</b> <b>SDL_LockRWLockForReading(SDL_RWLock</b> <b>*rwlock);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  will block until the rwlock is available, which is to say it is not locked for writing by any other
       thread. Of all threads waiting to lock the rwlock, all may do so at the same time as  long  as  they  are
       requesting  read-only access; if a thread wants to lock for writing, only one may do so at a time, and no
       other threads, read-only or not, may hold the lock at the same time.

       It is legal for the owning thread to lock an already-locked rwlock for reading. It  must  unlock  it  the
       same  number of times before it is actually made available for other threads in the system (this is known
       as a "recursive rwlock").

       Note that locking for writing is not recursive (this is only available to read-only locks).

       It is illegal to request a read-only lock from a thread that already  holds  the  write  lock.  Doing  so
       results in undefined behavior. Unlock the write lock before requesting a read-only lock. (But, of course,
       if you have the write lock, you don't need further locks to read in any case.)

       This  function does not fail; if rwlock is NULL, it will return immediately having locked nothing. If the
       rwlock is valid, this function will always block until it can lock the mutex, and return with it locked.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>rwlock</u> the read/write lock to lock.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
