</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>General</u> <u>note</u>: Most programs should use mutexes instead of spin locks.  Spin locks are primarily useful in
       conjunction with real-time scheduling policies.  See NOTES.

       The  <b>pthread_spin_init</b>()  function allocates any resources required for the use of the spin lock referred
       to by <u>lock</u> and initializes the lock to be in the unlocked state.  The <u>pshared</u> argument must have  one  of
       the following values:

       <b>PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE</b>
              The  spin  lock  is to be operated on only by threads in the same process as the thread that calls
              <b>pthread_spin_init</b>().  (Attempting to share the spin lock between processes  results  in  undefined
              behavior.)

       <b>PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED</b>
              The  spin  lock  may  be  operated  on  by any thread in any process that has access to the memory
              containing the lock (i.e., the lock may be in a shared memory object that is shared among multiple
              processes).

       Calling <b>pthread_spin_init</b>() on a spin lock  that  has  already  been  initialized  results  in  undefined
       behavior.

       The  <b>pthread_spin_destroy</b>()  function  destroys a previously initialized spin lock, freeing any resources
       that were allocated for that lock.  Destroying a spin lock that has not been previously been  initialized
       or destroying a spin lock while another thread holds the lock results in undefined behavior.

       Once  a  spin  lock  has  been  destroyed,  performing  any  operation  on  the lock other than once more
       initializing it with <b>pthread_spin_init</b>() results in undefined behavior.

       The  result  of  performing  operations  such  as   <b><a href="../man3/pthread_spin_lock.3.html">pthread_spin_lock</a></b>(3),   <b><a href="../man3/pthread_spin_unlock.3.html">pthread_spin_unlock</a></b>(3),   and
       <b>pthread_spin_destroy</b>() on <u>copies</u> of the object referred to by <u>lock</u> is undefined.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       On  success,  there  functions  return zero.  On failure, they return an error number.  In the event that
       <b>pthread_spin_init</b>() fails, the lock is not initialized.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pthread_spin_init</b>() may fail with the following errors:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> The system has insufficient resources to initialize a new spin lock.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> Insufficient memory to initialize the spin lock.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX.1-2008.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       glibc 2.2.  POSIX.1-2001.

       Support for process-shared spin locks  is  a  POSIX  option.   The  option  is  supported  in  the  glibc
       implementation.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Spin  locks should be employed in conjunction with real-time scheduling policies (<b>SCHED_FIFO</b>, or possibly
       <b>SCHED_RR</b>).  Use of spin locks with nondeterministic scheduling  policies  such  as  <b>SCHED_OTHER</b>  probably
       indicates  a  design mistake.  The problem is that if a thread operating under such a policy is scheduled
       off the CPU while it holds a spin lock, then other threads will waste time spinning on the lock until the
       lock holder is once more rescheduled and releases the lock.

       If threads create a deadlock situation while employing  spin  locks,  those  threads  will  spin  forever
       consuming CPU time.

       User-space  spin  locks are <u>not</u> applicable as a general locking solution.  They are, by definition, prone
       to priority inversion and unbounded spin times.  A programmer using  spin  locks  must  be  exceptionally
       careful  not  only in the code, but also in terms of system configuration, thread placement, and priority
       assignment.
