</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pthread_spin_destroy, pthread_spin_init — destroy or initialize a spin lock object

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</a>&gt;

       int pthread_spin_destroy(pthread_spinlock_t *<u>lock</u>);
       int pthread_spin_init(pthread_spinlock_t *<u>lock</u>, int <u>pshared</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>pthread_spin_destroy</u>()  function  shall  destroy  the  spin  lock referenced by <u>lock</u> and release any
       resources used by the lock. The effect of subsequent use of the lock  is  undefined  until  the  lock  is
       reinitialized    by    another   call   to   <u>pthread_spin_init</u>().    The   results   are   undefined   if
       <u>pthread_spin_destroy</u>() is called when a thread holds the lock, or if this  function  is  called  with  an
       uninitialized thread spin lock.

       The <u>pthread_spin_init</u>() function shall allocate any resources required to use the spin lock referenced by
       <u>lock</u> and initialize the lock to an unlocked state.

       If  the  Thread  Process-Shared  Synchronization  option  is  supported  and  the  value  of  <u>pshared</u>  is
       PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED, the implementation shall permit the spin lock to be operated upon by  any  thread
       that has access to the memory where the spin lock is allocated, even if it is allocated in memory that is
       shared by multiple processes.

       See <u>Section</u> <u>2.9.9</u>, <u>Synchronization</u> <u>Object</u> <u>Copies</u> <u>and</u> <u>Alternative</u> <u>Mappings</u> for further requirements.

       The  results  are undefined if <u>pthread_spin_init</u>() is called specifying an already initialized spin lock.
       The results are undefined if a spin lock is used without first being initialized.

       If the <u>pthread_spin_init</u>() function fails, the lock is not initialized  and  the  contents  of  <u>lock</u>  are
       undefined.

       Only the object referenced by <u>lock</u> may be used for performing synchronization.

       The result of referring to copies of that object in calls to <u>pthread_spin_destroy</u>(), <u>pthread_spin_lock</u>(),
       <u>pthread_spin_trylock</u>(), or <u>pthread_spin_unlock</u>() is undefined.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful  completion,  these  functions  shall  return  zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
       returned to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pthread_spin_init</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> The system lacks the necessary resources to initialize another spin lock.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> Insufficient memory exists to initialize the lock.

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <u>lock</u> argument to <u>pthread_spin_destroy</u>() does
       not refer to an initialized spin lock object, it is recommended that the function should fail and  report
       an <b>[EINVAL]</b> error.

       If  an  implementation detects that the value specified by the <u>lock</u> argument to <u>pthread_spin_destroy</u>() or
       <u>pthread_spin_init</u>() refers to a locked spin lock object, or detects that the value specified by the  <u>lock</u>
       argument to <u>pthread_spin_init</u>() refers to an already initialized spin lock object, it is recommended that
       the function should fail and report an <b>[EBUSY]</b> error.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
