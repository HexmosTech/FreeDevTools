       open - Open a file-based or command pipeline channel

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>open</b> <u>fileName</u>
       <b>open</b> <u>fileName</u> <u>access</u>
       <b>open</b> <u>fileName</u> <u>access</u> <u>permissions</u>
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  command opens a file, serial port, or command pipeline and returns a channel identifier that may be
       used in future invocations of commands like <b>read</b>, <b>puts</b>, and <b>close</b>.  If the first character of <u>fileName</u> is
       not <b>|</b> then the command opens a file: <u>fileName</u> gives the name of the file to open, and it must conform  to
       the conventions described in the <b>filename</b> manual entry.

       The  <u>access</u>  argument,  if  present,  indicates  the way in which the file (or command pipeline) is to be
       accessed.  In the first form <u>access</u> may have any of the following values:

       <b>r</b>      Open the file for reading only; the file must already exist. This is the default value  if  <u>access</u>
              is not specified.

       <b>r+</b>     Open the file for both reading and writing; the file must already exist.

       <b>w</b>      Open  the  file  for  writing only.  Truncate it if it exists.  If it does not exist, create a new
              file.

       <b>w+</b>     Open the file for reading and writing.  Truncate it if it exists.  If it does not exist, create  a
              new file.

       <b>a</b>      Open  the  file  for  writing only.  If the file does not exist, create a new empty file.  Set the
              file pointer to the end of the file prior to each write.

       <b>a+</b>     Open the file for reading and writing.  If the file does not exist, create a new empty file.   Set
              the initial access position  to the end of the file.

       All  of  the legal <u>access</u> values above may have the character <b>b</b> added as the second or third character in
       the value to indicate that the opened channel should be configured as if with the <b>fconfigure</b> <b>-translation</b>
       <b>binary</b> option, making the channel suitable for reading or writing of binary data.

       In the second form, <u>access</u> consists of a list of any of the following  flags,  most  of  which  have  the
       standard POSIX meanings.  One of the flags must be either <b>RDONLY</b>, <b>WRONLY</b> or <b>RDWR</b>.

       <b>RDONLY</b> Open the file for reading only.

       <b>WRONLY</b> Open the file for writing only.

       <b>RDWR</b>   Open the file for both reading and writing.

       <b>APPEND</b> Set the file pointer to the end of the file prior to each write.

       <b>BINARY</b> Configure the opened channel with the <b>-translation</b> <b>binary</b> option.

       <b>CREAT</b>  Create the file if it does not already exist (without this flag it is an error for the file not to
              exist).

       <b>EXCL</b>   If <b>CREAT</b> is also specified, an error is returned if the file already exists.

       <b>NOCTTY</b> If  the  file  is  a  terminal  device,  this flag prevents the file from becoming the controlling
              terminal of the process.

       <b>NONBLOCK</b>
              Prevents the process from blocking  while  opening  the  file,  and  possibly  in  subsequent  I/O
              operations.   The  exact  behavior  of  this  flag  is  system-  and device-dependent;  its use is
              discouraged (it is better to use the <b>fconfigure</b> command to put a file in nonblocking  mode).   For
              details refer to your system documentation on the <b>open</b> system call's <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> flag.

       <b>TRUNC</b>  If the file exists it is truncated to zero length.

       If  a  new file is created as part of opening it, <u>permissions</u> (an integer) is used to set the permissions
       for the new file in conjunction with the process's file mode  creation  mask.   <u>Permissions</u>  defaults  to
       0666.

       When  the file opened is an ordinary disk file, the <b>chan</b> <b>configure</b> and <b>fconfigure</b> commands can be used to 2
       query this additional configuration option:                                                               2

       <b>-stat</b>                                                                                                     2
              This option, when read, returns a dictionary of values much as is  obtained  from  the  <b>file</b>  <b>stat</b> 2
              command,  where  that stat information relates to the real opened file. Keys in the dictionary may 2
              include <b>atime</b>, <b>ctime</b>, <b>dev</b>, <b>gid</b>, <b>ino</b>, <b>mode</b>, <b>mtime</b>, <b>nlink</b>, <b>size</b>, <b>type</b>, and  <b>uid</b>  among  others;  the 2
              <b>mtime</b>,  <b>size</b>  and  <b>type</b> fields are guaranteed to be present and meaningful on all platforms; other 2
              keys may be present too.                                                                           2

              <u>Implementation</u> <u>note:</u> This option maps to a call to <b>fstat()</b> on POSIX platforms, and to  a  call  to 2
              <b>GetFileInformationByHandle()</b>  on  Windows;  the  information  reported  is what those system calls 2
              produce.                                                                                           2

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>PIPELINES</b></h4><pre>
       If the first character of <u>fileName</u> is “<b>|</b>” then the remaining characters of <u>fileName</u> are treated as a list
       of arguments that describe a command pipeline to invoke, in the same style as the arguments for <b>exec</b>.  In
       this case, the channel identifier returned by <b>open</b> may be used to write to the command's  input  pipe  or
       read  from  its output pipe, depending on the value of <u>access</u>.  If write-only access is used (e.g. <u>access</u>
       is “<b>w</b>”), then standard output for the  pipeline  is  directed  to  the  current  standard  output  unless
       overridden  by  the  command.   If  read-only access is used (e.g. <u>access</u> is “<b>r</b>”), standard input for the
       pipeline is taken from the current standard input unless overridden  by  the  command.   The  id  of  the
       spawned process is accessible through the <b>pid</b> command, using the channel id returned by <b>open</b> as argument.

       If  the  command (or one of the commands) executed in the command pipeline returns an error (according to
       the definition in <b>exec</b>), a Tcl error is generated when <b>close</b> is called on the channel unless the pipeline
       is in non-blocking mode then no exit status is returned (a silent <b>close</b> with -blocking 0).

       It is often useful to use the <b>fileevent</b> command with pipelines so other processing may happen at the same
       time as running the command in the background.

</pre><h4><b>SERIAL</b> <b>COMMUNICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If <u>fileName</u> refers to a serial port, then the specified serial  port  is  opened  and  initialized  in  a
       platform-dependent manner.  Acceptable values for the <u>fileName</u> to use to open a serial port are described
       in the PORTABILITY ISSUES section.

       The  <b>chan</b> <b>configure</b> and <b>fconfigure</b> commands can be used to query and set additional configuration options
       specific to serial ports (where supported):

       <b>-mode</b> <u>baud</u><b>,</b><u>parity</u><b>,</b><u>data</u><b>,</b><u>stop</u>
              This option is a set of 4 comma-separated values: the baud rate, parity, number of data bits,  and
              number  of  stop  bits for this serial port.  The <u>baud</u> rate is a simple integer that specifies the
              connection speed.  <u>Parity</u> is one of the following letters: <b>n</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>s</b>; respectively  signifying
              the  parity options of “none”, “odd”, “even”, “mark”, or “space”.  <u>Data</u> is the number of data bits
              and should be an integer from 5 to 8, while <u>stop</u> is the number of stop  bits  and  should  be  the
              integer 1 or 2.

       <b>-handshake</b> <u>type</u>
              (Windows  and  Unix).  This option is used to setup automatic handshake control. Note that not all
              handshake types maybe supported by your operating system. The <u>type</u> parameter is case-independent.

              If <u>type</u> is <b>none</b> then any handshake is switched off.  <b>rtscts</b> activates hardware handshake. Hardware
              handshake signals are described below.  For software handshake <b>xonxoff</b>  the  handshake  characters
              can  be  redefined  with  <b>-xchar</b>.  An additional hardware handshake <b>dtrdsr</b> is available only under
              Windows.  There is no default handshake configuration, the initial value depends on your operating
              system settings.  The <b>-handshake</b> option cannot be queried.

       <b>-queue</b> (Windows and Unix). The <b>-queue</b> option can only be queried.  It returns  a  list  of  two  integers
              representing the current number of bytes in the input and output queue respectively.

       <b>-timeout</b> <u>msec</u>
              (Windows  and  Unix).  This  option  is  used  to set the timeout for blocking read operations. It
              specifies the maximum interval between the reception of  two  bytes  in  milliseconds.   For  Unix
              systems the granularity is 100 milliseconds.  The <b>-timeout</b> option does not affect write operations
              or nonblocking reads.  This option cannot be queried.

       <b>-ttycontrol</b> <u>{signal</u> <u>boolean</u> <u>signal</u> <u>boolean</u> <u>...}</u>
              (Windows  and  Unix).  This  option  is  used  to  setup  the  handshake  output lines (see below)
              permanently or to send a BREAK over the serial line.  The <u>signal</u> names are case-independent.  <b>{RTS</b>
              <b>1</b> <b>DTR</b> <b>0}</b> sets the RTS output to high and the DTR output to low.  The BREAK condition  (see  below)
              is  enabled  and  disabled  with  <b>{BREAK</b>  <b>1}</b> and <b>{BREAK</b> <b>0}</b> respectively.  It is not a good idea to
              change the <b>RTS</b> (or <b>DTR</b>) signal with active hardware handshake <b>rtscts</b> (or <b>dtrdsr</b>).  The  result  is
              unpredictable.  The <b>-ttycontrol</b> option cannot be queried.

       <b>-ttystatus</b>
              (Windows  and  Unix).  The  <b>-ttystatus</b>  option  can only be queried.  It returns the current modem
              status and handshake input signals (see below).  The result is a list of signal,value pairs with a
              fixed order, e.g. <b>{CTS</b> <b>1</b> <b>DSR</b> <b>0</b> <b>RING</b> <b>1</b> <b>DCD</b> <b>0}</b>.  The <u>signal</u> names are returned upper case.

       <b>-xchar</b> <u>{xonChar</u> <u>xoffChar}</u>
              (Windows and Unix). This option is used to query or  change  the  software  handshake  characters.
              Normally  the  operating system default should be DC1 (0x11) and DC3 (0x13) representing the ASCII
              standard XON and XOFF characters.

       <b>-closemode</b> <u>closeMode</u>
              (Windows and Unix). This option is used to query or change the close mode of the  serial  channel, 2
              which  defines  how  pending  output  in  operating  system buffers is handled when the channel is 2
              closed. The following values for <u>closeMode</u> are supported:                                          2

              <b>default</b>                                                                                            2
                     indicates that a system default operation should be used; all serial  channels  default  to 2
                     this.                                                                                       2

              <b>discard</b>                                                                                            2
                     indicates  that  the contents of the OS buffers should be discarded.  Note that this is <u>not</u> 2
                     <u>recommended</u> when writing to a POSIX terminal, as it can interact unexpectedly with handling 2
                     of <b>stderr</b>.                                                                                  2

              <b>drain</b>                                                                                              2
                     indicates that Tcl should wait when closing the channel until all output has been consumed. 2
                     This may slow down <b>close</b> noticeably.                                                        2

       <b>-inputmode</b> <u>inputMode</u>
              (Unix only; Windows has the equivalent option on console channels). This option is used  to  query 2
              or  change  the  input  mode  of  the  serial channel under the assumption that it is talking to a 2
              terminal, which controls how interactive input from users is handled.  The  following  values  for 2
              <u>inputMode</u> are supported:                                                                           2

              <b>normal</b>                                                                                             2
                     indicates  that  normal  line-oriented input should be used, with standard terminal editing 2
                     capabilities enabled.                                                                       2

              <b>password</b>                                                                                           2
                     indicates  that  non-echoing  input  should  be  used,  with  standard   terminal   editing 2
                     capabilities  enabled  but  no  writing  of  typed  characters  to the terminal (except for 2
                     newlines). Some terminals may indicate this specially.                                      2

              <b>raw</b>                                                                                                2
                     indicates that all keyboard input should be given directly to Tcl with the  terminal  doing 2
                     no  processing  at  all.  It  does  not  echo  the keys, leaving it up to the Tcl script to 2
                     interpret what to do.                                                                       2

              <b>reset</b> (set only)                                                                                   2
                     indicates that the terminal should be reset to what state it was in when the  terminal  was 2
                     opened.                                                                                     2

              Note  that  setting  this  option  (technically, anything that changes the terminal state from its 2
              initial value <u>via</u> <u>this</u> <u>option</u>) will cause the channel  to  turn  on  an  automatic  reset  of  the 2
              terminal when the channel is closed.                                                               2

       <b>-winsize</b>                                                                                                  2
              (Unix  only; Windows has the equivalent option on console channels). This option is query only. It 2
              retrieves a two-element list with the the current width and height of the terminal.

       <b>-pollinterval</b> <u>msec</u>
              (Windows only). This option is used to set the maximum time between polling for fileevents.   This
              affects the time interval between checking for events throughout the Tcl interpreter (the smallest
              value  always  wins).  Use this option only if you want to poll the serial port more or less often
              than 10 msec (the default).

       <b>-sysbuffer</b> <u>inSize</u>

       <b>-sysbuffer</b> <u>{inSize</u> <u>outSize}</u>
              (Windows only). This option is used to change the size of Windows  system  buffers  for  a  serial
              channel.  Especially at higher communication rates the default input buffer size of 4096 bytes can
              overrun for latent systems. The first form specifies the input buffer size,  in  the  second  form
              both input and output buffers are defined.

       <b>-lasterror</b>
              (Windows  only). This option is query only.  In case of a serial communication error, <b>read</b> or <b>puts</b>
              returns a general Tcl file I/O error.  <b>fconfigure</b> <b>-lasterror</b> can be called to get a list of  error
              details.  See below for an explanation of the various error codes.

   <b>SERIAL</b> <b>PORT</b> <b>SIGNALS</b>
       RS-232  is  the  most  commonly  used standard electrical interface for serial communications. A negative
       voltage (-3V..-12V) define a mark (on=1) bit and a positive voltage (+3..+12V) define a space (off=0) bit
       (RS-232C).  The following signals are  specified  for  incoming  and  outgoing  data,  status  lines  and
       handshaking. Here we are using the terms <u>workstation</u> for your computer and <u>modem</u> for the external device,
       because some signal names (DCD, RI) come from modems. Of course your external device may use these signal
       lines for other purposes.

       <b>TXD</b> (output)
              <b>Transmitted</b> <b>Data:</b> Outgoing serial data.

       <b>RXD</b> (input)
              <b>Received</b> <b>Data:</b>Incoming serial data.

       <b>RTS</b> (output)
              <b>Request</b>  <b>To</b> <b>Send:</b> This hardware handshake line informs the modem that your workstation is ready to
              receive data. Your workstation may automatically reset this signal  to  indicate  that  the  input
              buffer is full.

       <b>CTS</b> (input)
              <b>Clear</b> <b>To</b> <b>Send:</b> The complement to RTS. Indicates that the modem is ready to receive data.

       <b>DTR</b> (output)
              <b>Data</b>  <b>Terminal</b>  <b>Ready:</b>  This  signal  tells the modem that the workstation is ready to establish a
              link. DTR is often enabled automatically whenever a serial port is opened.

       <b>DSR</b> (input)
              <b>Data</b> <b>Set</b> <b>Ready:</b> The complement to DTR. Tells the workstation that the modem is ready to  establish
              a link.

       <b>DCD</b> (input)
              <b>Data</b> <b>Carrier</b> <b>Detect:</b> This line becomes active when a modem detects a “Carrier” signal.

       <b>RI</b> (input)
              <b>Ring</b> <b>Indicator:</b> Goes active when the modem detects an incoming call.

       <b>BREAK</b>  A  BREAK condition is not a hardware signal line, but a logical zero on the TXD or RXD lines for a
              long period of time, usually 250 to 500 milliseconds.  Normally a receive or transmit data  signal
              stays  at  the  mark  (on=1) voltage until the next character is transferred. A BREAK is sometimes
              used to reset the communications line or change the operating mode of communications hardware.

   <b>ERROR</b> <b>CODES</b> <b>(Windows</b> <b>only)</b>
       A lot of different errors may occur during serial read operations or during event polling in  background.
       The  external  device may have been switched off, the data lines may be noisy, system buffers may overrun
       or your mode settings may be wrong.  That is why a reliable software  should  always  <b>catch</b>  serial  read
       operations.   In  cases of an error Tcl returns a general file I/O error.  Then <b>fconfigure</b> <b>-lasterror</b> may
       help to locate the problem.  The following error codes may be returned.

       <b>RXOVER</b> Windows input buffer overrun. The data comes faster than your scripts reads it or your  system  is
              overloaded.  Use  <b>fconfigure</b>  <b>-sysbuffer</b>  to  avoid a temporary bottleneck and/or make your script
              faster.

       <b>TXFULL</b> Windows output buffer overrun. Complement to RXOVER. This error  should  practically  not  happen,
              because Tcl cares about the output buffer status.

       <b>OVERRUN</b>
              UART  buffer  overrun  (hardware)  with  data  lost.  The data comes faster than the system driver
              receives it.  Check your advanced serial port settings to enable the FIFO  (16550)  buffer  and/or
              setup a <a href="../man1/lower.1.html">lower</a>(1) interrupt threshold value.

       <b>RXPARITY</b>
              A  parity  error has been detected by your UART.  Wrong parity settings with <b>fconfigure</b> <b>-mode</b> or a
              noisy data line (RXD) may cause this error.

       <b>FRAME</b>  A stop-bit error has been detected by your UART.  Wrong mode settings with <b>fconfigure</b> <b>-mode</b>  or  a
              noisy data line (RXD) may cause this error.

       <b>BREAK</b>  A BREAK condition has been detected by your UART (see above).

   <b>PORTABILITY</b> <b>ISSUES</b>
       <b>Windows</b>
              Valid  values  for  <u>fileName</u>  to  open  a  serial  port are of the form <b>com</b><u>X</u>, where <u>X</u> is a number,
              generally from 1 to 9.  A legacy form accepted as well is <b>com</b><u>X</u><b>:</b>.  This  notation  only  works  for
              serial  ports  from  1 to 9.  An attempt to open a serial port that does not exist or has a number
              greater than 9 will fail.  An alternate form of opening  serial  ports  is  to  use  the  filename
              <b>//./comX</b>, where X is any number that corresponds to a serial port.

              When  running  Tcl interactively, there may be some strange interactions between the real console,
              if one is present, and a command pipeline that uses  standard  input  or  output.   If  a  command
              pipeline  is  opened  for  reading,  some  of the lines entered at the console will be sent to the
              command pipeline and some will be sent to the Tcl evaluator.  If a command pipeline is opened  for
              writing,  keystrokes  entered  into  the  console are not visible until the pipe is closed.  These
              problems only occur because both Tcl and the child application are competing for  the  console  at
              the same time.  If the command pipeline is started from a script, so that Tcl is not accessing the
              console,  or if the command pipeline does not use standard input or output, but is redirected from
              or to a file, then the above problems do not occur.

              Files opened in the “<b>a</b>” mode or with the <b>APPEND</b> flag set are implemented  by  seeking  immediately
              before  each  write,  which  is not an atomic operation and does not carry the guarantee of strict
              appending that is present on POSIX platforms.

       <b>Unix</b>   Valid values for <u>fileName</u> to open a serial port are generally of the form <b>/dev/tty</b><u>X</u>, where <u>X</u> is  <b>a</b>
              or  <b>b</b>,  but  the  name  of  any  pseudo-file  that  maps  to  a serial port may be used.  Advanced
              configuration options are only supported for serial ports when Tcl  is  built  to  use  the  POSIX
              serial interface.

              When running Tcl interactively, there may be some strange interactions between the console, if one
              is  present, and a command pipeline that uses standard input.  If a command pipeline is opened for
              reading, some of the lines entered at the console will be sent to the command  pipeline  and  some
              will  be  sent  to  the  Tcl  evaluator.   This problem only occurs because both Tcl and the child
              application are competing for the console at the same time.  If the command  pipeline  is  started
              from  a  script, so that Tcl is not accessing the console, or if the command pipeline does not use
              standard input, but is redirected from a file, then the above problem does not occur.

</pre><h4><b>CONSOLE</b> <b>CHANNELS</b></h4><pre>
       On Windows only, console channels (usually <b>stdin</b> or <b>stdout</b>) support the following options:                2

       <b>-inputmode</b> <u>inputMode</u>                                                                                      2
              This option is used to query or change the input mode of the console channel, which  controls  how 2
              interactive input from users is handled. The following values for <u>inputMode</u> are supported:         2

              <b>normal</b>                                                                                             2
                     indicates  that  normal  line-oriented  input should be used, with standard console editing 2
                     capabilities enabled.                                                                       2

              <b>password</b>                                                                                           2
                     indicates that non-echoing input should be used, with standard console editing capabilities 2
                     enabled but no writing of typed characters to the terminal (except for newlines).           2

              <b>raw</b>                                                                                                2
                     indicates that all keyboard input should be given directly to Tcl with the console doing no 2
                     processing at all. It does not echo the keys, leaving it up to the Tcl script to  interpret 2
                     what to do.                                                                                 2

              <b>reset</b> (set only)                                                                                   2
                     indicates that the console should be reset to what state it was in when the console channel 2
                     was opened.                                                                                 2

              Note  that  setting  this  option  (technically,  anything that changes the console state from its 2
              default <u>via</u> <u>this</u> <u>option</u>) will cause the channel to turn on an automatic reset of the console  when 2
              the channel is closed.                                                                             2

       <b>-winsize</b>                                                                                                  2
              This  option  is query only.  It retrieves a two-element list with the current width and height of 2
              the console that this channel is talking to.                                                       2

       Note that the equivalent options exist on Unix, but are on the serial channel type.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Open a file for writing, forcing it to be created and raising an error if it already exists.

              set myNewFile [<b>open</b> filename.txt {WRONLY CREAT EXCL}]

       Open a file for writing as a log file.

              set myLogFile [<b>open</b> filename.log "a"]
              fconfigure $myLogFile -buffering line

       Open a command pipeline and catch any errors:

              set fl [<b>open</b> "| ls this_file_does_not_exist"]
              set data [read $fl]
              if {[catch {close $fl} err]} {
                  puts "ls command failed: $err"
              }

       Open a command pipeline and read binary data from it. Note the unusual form with  “|[list”  that  handles
       non-trivial edge cases with arguments that potentially have spaces in.

              set fl [<b>open</b> |[list create_image_data $input] "rb"]
              set binData [read $fl]
              close $fl

       Read a password securely from the user (assuming that the script is being run interactively):             2

              chan configure stdin <b>-inputmode</b> <b>password</b>                                                           2
              try {                                                                                              2
                  chan puts -nonewline "Password: "                                                              2
                  chan flush stdout                                                                              2
                  set thePassword [chan gets stdin]                                                              2
              } finally {                                                                                        2
