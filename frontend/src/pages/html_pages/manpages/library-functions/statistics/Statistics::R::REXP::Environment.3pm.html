</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Statistics::R::REXP::Environment - an R environment

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.0002

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Statistics::R::REXP::Environment

           my $env = Statistics::R::REXP::Environment-&gt;new({
               x =&gt; Statistics::R::REXP::Character-&gt;new(['foo', 'bar']),
               b =&gt; Statistics::R::REXP::Double-&gt;new([1, 2, 3]),
           });
           print $env-&gt;elements;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An object of this class represents an R environment ("ENVSXP").  Environments in R consist of a <u>frame</u>, a
       set of symbol-value pairs, and an <u>enclosure</u>, a pointer to an enclosing (also called "parent")
       environment. Environments form a tree structure, with a special <u>emptyenv</u> environment at the root, which
       has no parent.

       These objects represent calls (such as model formulae), with first element a reference to the function
       being called, and the remainder the actual arguments of the call. Names of arguments, if given, are
       recorded in the 'names' attribute (itself as Statistics::R::REXP::Character vector), with unnamed
       arguments having name ''. If no arguments were named, the environment objects will not have a defined
       'names' attribute.

       You shouldn't create instances of this class, it exists mainly to handle deserialization of "ENVSXP"s by
       the "IO" classes.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "Statistics::R::REXP:Environment" inherits from Statistics::R::REXP::Vector, with the added restriction
       that its first element has to be a Statistics::R::REXP::Symbol or another "Environment" instance. Trying
       to create a Environment instance that doesn't follow this restriction will raise an exception.

   <b>ACCESSORS</b>
       frame
           Returns a reference to the hash of symbol-value pairs representing the environment's frame, i.e., the
           variable with bound values in the environment.

       enclosure
           Returns a reference to the parent Environment, if it is defined.

       name
           Environments  can  be  named, although this is not normally settable from R code. Typically, only the
           system environments (such as namespaces), and environments created by "attach"-ing an object, have  a
           name.

       sexptype
           SEXPTYPE of environments is "ENVSXP".

       to_pl
           Environments  do  not  have a native Perl representation and trying to call this access will raise an
           exception.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Classes in the "REXP" hierarchy are intended to be immutable. Please do not try to change their value  or
       attributes.

       There are no known bugs in this module. Please see Statistics::R::IO for bug reporting.
