</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Statistics::R::IO - Perl interface to serialized R data

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.0002

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Statistics::R::IO;

           my $var = Statistics::R::IO::readRDS('file.rds');
           print $var-&gt;to_pl;

           my %r_workspace = Statistics::R::IO::readRData('.RData');
           while (my ($var_name, $value) = each %r_workspace) {
               print $var_name, $value;
           }

           my $pi = Statistics::R::IO::evalRserve('pi');
           print $pi-&gt;to_pl;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is a pure-Perl implementation for reading native data files produced by the R statistical
       computing environment &lt;<a href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</a>&gt;)

       It provides routines for reading files in the two primary file formats used in R for serializing native
       objects:

       RDS RDS files store a serialization of a single R object (and, if the object contains references to other
           objects,  such  as  environments,  all  the referenced objects as well). These files are created in R
           using the "readRDS" function and are typically named with the ".rds" file extension.

       RData
           RData files store a serialization of a collection of <u>named</u>  objects,  typically  a  workspace.  These
           files  are  created  in  R  using  the "save" function and are typically named with the ".RData" file
           extension.  (Contents of the R workspace can also be saved automatically on exit to  the  file  named
           <u>.RData</u>, which is by default automatically read in on startup.)

       As  of  version  0.04,  the  module  can  also  evaluate  R  code  on  a remote host that runs the Rserve
       &lt;<a href="http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/">http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/</a>&gt; binary R server. This allows Perl programs to access all facilities of  R
       without the need to have a local install of R or link to an R library.

       See  "SUBROUTINES"  for  invocation  and usage information on individual subroutines, and the R Internals
       manual &lt;<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-ints.html">http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-ints.html</a>&gt; for the specification of the file formats.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORT</b></h4><pre>
       Nothing by default. Optionally, subroutines "readRDS", "readRData", and "evalRserve", or ":all"  for  all
       three.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       readRDS EXPR
           Reads a file in RDS format whose filename is given by EXPR and returns a Statistics::R::REXP object.

       readRData EXPR
           Reads  a  file  in RData format whose filename is given by EXPR and returns a hash whose keys are the
           names of objects stored in the file with corresponding values as Statistics::R::REXP instances.

       evalRserve REXPR [ HOSTNAME [, PORT] | HANDLE]
           Evaluates   an   R   expression,   given   as    text    string    in    REXPR,    on    an    Rserve
           &lt;<a href="http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/">http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/</a>&gt; server and returns its result as a Statistics::R::REXP object.

           The  server location can be specified either by its host name and (optionally) port or by a connected
           instance of IO::Handle. The caller passing the HANDLE is responsible for reading (and  checking)  the
           server  ID  that  is returned in the first 32-byte response when the connection was established. This
           allows opening the connection once and reusing it in multiple calls to 'evalRserve'.

           If only REXPR is given, the function assumes that the server runs on the localhost. If  PORT  is  not
           specified, it defaults to the standard Rserve port, 6311.

           The  function will close the connection to the Rserve host if it has opened it itself, but not if the
           connection was passed as a HANDLE.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The module currently handles the 'version 2' serialization  format,  used  since  R  1.4.0  (released  in
       December  2001). Only XDR and native-order binary is implemented, and since the R documentation describes
       the ASCII save format as "now mainly of historical interest", this is unlikely to change soon.  No  check
       is  performed  that  a  file  stored  in native-order binary was created on a platform that used the same
       order, and it is up to the caller to ensure compatibility. (Given that the default save  format  is  XDR,
       and  the  prevalence of Intel platforms, this is unlikely to be a problem for either publicly-distributed
       or internal data files.)

       Data files compressed with 'gzip' and 'bzip2' are supported, but  not  'xz'  ones.  Again,  given  the  R
       defaults  ('gzip')  and the fact that "IO::Uncompress::UnXz" is not production-ready, this is unlikely to
       change soon.

       There are some R types that are not (yet) implemented, although all typical "user-facing" types  --  such
       as vectors, lists, and environments -- are. The remaining R types will be implemented as-needed; in other
       words,  if  you  come across one that you need to read a particular file, please send me the type (the id
       will included in the "unimplemented SEXPTYPE" error message) and, if possible, how it was generated.

       There  are  no  known  bugs  in  this  module.  Please  report  any   bugs   or   feature   requests   to
       "bug-statistics-r-io      at      rt.cpan.org",      or      through     the     web     interface     at

       automatically be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.
