       ZoneMinder::Logger - ZoneMinder Logger module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       use ZoneMinder::Logger; use ZoneMinder::Logger qw(:all);

       logInit( 'myproc', DEBUG );

       Debug( 'This is what is happening' ); Info( 'Something interesting is happening' ); Warning( 'Something
       might be going wrong.' ); Error( 'Something has gone wrong!!' ); Fatal( 'Something has gone badly wrong,
       gotta stop!!' ); Panic( 'Something fundamental has gone wrong, die with stack trace' );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The ZoneMinder:Logger module contains the common debug and error reporting routines used by the
       ZoneMinder scripts.

       To use debug in your scripts you need to include this module, and call logInit. Thereafter you can
       sprinkle Debug or Error calls etc throughout the code safe in the knowledge that they will be reported to
       your error log, and possibly the syslogger, in a meaningful and consistent format.

       Debug is discussed in terms of levels where 1 and above (currently only 1 for scripts) is considered
       debug, 0 is considered as informational, -1 is a warning, -2 is an error and -3 is a fatal error or
       panic. Where levels are mentioned below as thresholds the value given and anything with a lower level
       (ie. more serious) will be included.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       logInit ( $id, %options );
           Initialises  the debug and prepares the logging for forthcoming operations.  If not called explicitly
           it will be called by the first debug call in your script, but with default (and probably meaningless)
           options. The only compulsory arguments are $id which must be a string that will identify debug coming
           from this script in mixed logs. Other options may be provided as below,

           Option        Default        Description ---------     ---------      ----------- level          INFO
           The  initial  debug  level  which  defines  which  statements  are output and which are ignored trace
           0          Whether to use the Carp::shortmess format in debug statements to identify where the  debug
           was  emitted from termLevel     NOLOG      At what level debug is written to terminal standard error,
           0 is no, 1 is yes, 2 is write only if terminal  databaseLevel  INFO        At  what  level  debug  is
           written  to the Log table in the database; fileLevel     NOLOG      At what level debug is written to
           a log file of the format of &lt;id&gt;.log in the standard log directory.  syslogLevel   INFO       At what
           level debug is written to syslog.

           To disable any of these action entirely set to NOLOG

       logTerm ();
           Used to end the debug session and close any logs etc. Not usually necessary.

       $id            = logId ( [$id] );
       $level         = logLevel ( [$level] );
       $trace         = logTrace ( [$trace] );
       $level         = logLevel ( [$level] );
       $termLevel     = logTermLevel ( [$termLevel] );
       $databaseLevel = logDatabaseLevel ( [$databaseLevel] );
       $fileLevel     = logFileLevel ( [$fileLevel] );
       $syslogLevel   = logSyslogLevel ( [$syslogLevel] );
           These methods can be used to get and set the current settings as defined in logInit.

       Debug( $string );
           This method will output a debug message if  the  current  debug  level  permits  it,  otherwise  does
           nothing. This message will be tagged with the DBG string in the logs.

       Info( $string );
           This  method  will  output  an informational message if the current debug level permits it, otherwise
           does nothing. This message will be tagged with the INF string in the logs.

       Warning( $string );
           This method will output a warning message if the current  debug  level  permits  it,  otherwise  does
           nothing. This message will be tagged with the WAR string in the logs.

       Error( $string );
           This  method  will  output  an  error  message  if the current debug level permits it, otherwise does
           nothing. This message will be tagged with the ERR string in the logs.

       Fatal( $string );
           This method will output a fatal error message and then die if the current  debug  level  permits  it,
           otherwise does nothing. This message will be tagged with the FAT string in the logs.

       Panic( $string );
           This  method  will  output a panic error message and then die with a stack trace if the current debug
           level permits it, otherwise does nothing. This message will be tagged with  the  PNC  string  in  the
           logs.

   <b>EXPORT</b>
       None  by  default.  The :constants tag will export the debug constants which define the various levels of
       debug The :variables tag will export variables containing the current debug id and level  The  :functions
       tag  will  export  the  debug  functions. This or :all is what you would normally use.  The :all tag will
       export all above symbols.
