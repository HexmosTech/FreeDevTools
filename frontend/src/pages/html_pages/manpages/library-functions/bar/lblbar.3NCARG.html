</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       LBLBAR - Draws a complete label bar.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        CALL LBLBAR (IHOV, XLEB, XREB, YBEB, YTEB, NBOX, WSFB,
       + HSFB, LFIN, IFTP, LLBS, NLBS, LBAB)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_lblbar (int ihov, float xleb, float xreb,
       float ybeb, float yteb, int nbox, float wsfb,
       float hsfb, int *lfin, int iftp, char *llbs[],
       int nlbs, int lbab)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       IHOV        (an  input  expression of type INTEGER) is zero if the bar is to be oriented horizontally and
                   non-zero if the bar is to be oriented vertically.

       XLEB, XREB, YBEB, YTEB
                   (input expressions of type REAL) specify a rectangular area in the plotter frame in which the
                   entire bar, including labels, is to fit. Each is a real number between 0  and  1,  inclusive.
                   XLEB  specifies  the  position  of the left edge of the area; XREB, the position of the right
                   edge of the area; YBEB, the position of the bottom edge of the area; and YTEB,  the  position
                   of  the top edge of the area. A horizontal bar should probably be made wider than it is high;
                   similarly, a vertical bar should probably be made higher than it is wide.

       NBOX        (an input expression of type INTEGER)  may  be  positive  or  negative;  its  absolute  value
                   specifies  the number of rectangular pieces (let's call them boxes) into which the bar should
                   be divided.  All the boxes will be the same size. A horizontal bar will be divided into boxes
                   using vertical lines and a vertical bar will be divided into boxes  using  horizontal  lines.
                   The  boxes  in a horizontal bar are considered to be ordered from left to right and the boxes
                   in a vertical bar from bottom to top.  This ordering  determines  the  order  in  which  fill
                   indices  and  labels  are  given. If NBOX is positive, the boxes will be outlined after being
                   drawn; if NBOX is negative, the boxes will not be outlined.

       WSFB, HSFB  (input expressions of type REAL) determine what part of each box is  to  be  color-filled  or
                   pattern-filled.  Each  is  a number between 0 and 1; they specify the horizontal and vertical
                   dimensions, respectively, of the filled sub-box, as fractions of the horizontal and  vertical
                   dimensions  of  the  whole  box.   The  exact position of each sub-box within its box will be
                   determined for you, depending on how you choose to have the bar labeled.

       LFIN        (an input array of type INTEGER) contains a list of indices, one for each  box  in  the  bar;
                   each index determines how the filling of the associated box is to be done. These may be color
                   indices or some other kind of indices, depending on the value of the next argument, IFTP.

       IFTP        (an  input  expression  of  type  INTEGER)  specifies  how the sub-boxes should be filled, as
                   follows:

                   •   If the value of IFTP is zero, LBLBAR fills each sub-box by calling the routine SFSGFA, in
                       the package Softfill. In this case, the value of the  Softfill  internal  parameter  `TY'
                       determines whether filling is done by calls to the GKS routine GFA or by drawing closely-
                       spaced colored lines, which simulates solid fill, or by drawing lines which form patterns
                       of different apparent densities.

                   •   If  the  value  of IFTP is non-zero, the routine LBFILL will be called to do the filling.
                       You may supply your own version of the routine LBFILL.

                   Prior to the filling of the boxes, the current polyline  color  and  width  will  be  set  as
                   specified  by the values of the internal parameters 'CFL' and 'WFL', respectively. Therefore,
                   if lines are used to do the fill and the method chosen does not otherwise set polyline  color
                   and width, the values of 'CFL' and 'WFL' will take effect.

                   After  filling  is  complete,  the  filled sub-boxes may be outlined using the color and line
                   width specified by the Labelbar internal parameters `CBL' and  `WBL'.  (As  mentioned  above,
                   this is done only if the argument NBOX is positive; it is suppressed if NBOX is negative.)

       LLBS        (an  input array of type CHARACTER) provides a list of labels for the bar; the number of such
                   labels may be equal to:

                   •   the number of boxes less one, in which case the labels are associated with the  divisions
                       between the boxes, or to

                   •   the  number  of boxes, in which case the labels are associated with the boxes themselves,
                       or to

                   •   the number of boxes plus one, in which case  the  first  label  is  associated  with  the
                       beginning  of  the  bar,  the last label with the end of the bar, and the ones in between
                       with the divisions between the boxes.

                   The labels are drawn by calls to the Plotchar routine PLCHHQ.  They are drawn  in  the  color
                   specified  by the Labelbar internal parameter 'CLB' and using the polyline width specified by
                   the Labelbar internal parameter 'WLB'.

       NLBS        (an input expression of type INTEGER) specifies the number of labels in the array LLBS.

       LBAB        (an input expression of type INTEGER) specifies on which side or sides of the bar the  labels
                   are  to  be  written. The value 0 specifies that the bar is to be unlabeled, the value 1 that
                   the labels are to be below a horizontal bar or to the right of a vertical bar,  the  value  2
                   that  the  labels  are to be above a horizontal bar or to the left of a vertical bar, and the
                   value 3 that the labels are to be repeated on both sides of  the  bar.  The  labels  will  be
                   scaled  in  such  a way as not to overlap one another or to run outside the area in which the
                   label bar is to lie (except perhaps for labels at the ends of the bar).
