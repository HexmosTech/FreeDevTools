</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Params::Coerce - Allows your classes to do coercion of parameters

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.15

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # Coerce a object of class Foo to a Bar
         my $bar = Params::Coerce::coerce('Bar', $Foo)

         # Create a coercion param function
         use Params::Coerce '_Bar' =&gt; 'Bar';
         my $bar = _Bar($Foo);

         # Usage when Bar has a 'from' method
         my $bar = Bar-&gt;from($Foo);

       Real world example using HTML::Location.

         # My class needs a URI
         package Web::Spider;

         use URI;
         use Params::Coerce 'coerce';

         sub new {
             my $class = shift;

             # Where do we start spidering
             my $start = coerce('URI', shift) or die "Wasn't passed a URI";

             bless { root =&gt; $start }, $class;
         }

         #############################################
         # Now we can do the following

         # Pass a URI as normal
         my $URI     = URI-&gt;new('<a href="http://ali.as/">http://ali.as/</a>');
         my $Spider1 = Web::Spider-&gt;new( $URI );

         # We can also pass anything that can be coerced into being a URI
         my $Website = HTML::Location-&gt;new( '/home/adam/public_html', '<a href="http://ali.as">http://ali.as</a>' );
         my $Spider2 = Web::Spider-&gt;new( $Website );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A big part of good API design is that we should be able to be flexible in the ways that we take
       parameters.

       Params::Coerce attempts to encourage this, by making it easier to take a variety of different arguments,
       while adding negligible additional complexity to your code.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>Coercion</b>
       "Coercion" in computing terms generally refers to "implicit type conversion". This is where data and
       object are converted from one type to another behind the scenes, and you just just magically get what you
       need.

       The overload pragma, and its string overloading is the form of coercion you are most likely to have
       encountered in Perl programming. In this case, your object is automatically (within perl itself) coerced
       into a string.

       "Params::Coerce" is intended for higher-order coercion between various types of different objects, for
       use mainly in subroutine and (mostly) method parameters, particularly on external APIs.

   <b>__as_Another_Class</b> <b>Methods</b>
       At the heart of "Params::Coerce" is the ability to transform objects from one thing to another. This can
       be done by a variety of different mechanisms.

       The preferred mechanism for this is by creating a specially named method in a class that indicates it can
       be coerced into another type of object.

       As an example, HTML::Location provides an object method that returns an equivalent URI object.

         # In the package HTML::Location

         # Coerce to a URI
         sub __as_URI {
               my $self = shift;
               return URI-&gt;new( $self-&gt;uri );
         }

   <b>__from_Another_Class</b> <b>Methods</b>
       From version 0.04 of "Params::Coerce", you may now also provide __from_Another_Class methods as well. In
       the above example, rather then having to define a method in HTML::Location, you may instead define one in
       URI. The following code has an identical effect.

         # In the package URI

         # Coerce from a HTML::Location
         sub __from_HTML_Location {
               my $Location = shift;
               return URI-&gt;new( $Location-&gt;uri );
         }

       "Params::Coerce" will only look for the __from method, if it does not find a __as method.

   <b>Loading</b> <b>Classes</b>
       One thing to note with the "__as_Another_Class" methods is that you are <b>not</b> required to load the class
       you are converting to in the class you are converting from.

       In the above example, HTML::Location does <b>not</b> have to load the URI class. The need to load the classes
       for every object we might some day need to be coerced to would result in highly excessive resource usage.

       Instead, "Params::Coerce" guarantees that the class you are converting to "will" be loaded before it
       calls the __as_Another_Class method. Of course, in most situations you will have already loaded it for
       another purpose in either the From or To classes and this won't be an issue.

       If you make use of some class <b>other</b> <b>than</b> the class you are being coerced to in the __as_Another_Class
       method, you will need to make sure that is loaded in your code, but it is suggested that you do it at
       run-time with a "require" if you are not using it already elsewhere.

   <b>Coercing</b> <b>a</b> <b>Parameter</b>
       The most explicit way of accessing the coercion functionality is with the Params::Coerce::coerce
       function. It takes as its first argument the name of the class you wish to coerce <b>to</b>, followed by the
       parameter to which you wish to apply the coercion.

         package My::Class;

         use URI ();
         use Params::Coerce '_URI' =&gt; 'URI';

         sub new {
               my $class = shift;

               # Take a URI argument
               my $URI = Params::Coerce::coerce('URI', shift) or return;

               ...
         }

       For people doing procedural programming, you may also import this function.

         # Import the coerce function
         use Params::Coerce 'coerce';

       Please note that the "coerce" function is the <b>only</b> function that can be imported, and that the two
       argument pragma (or the passing of two or more arguments to -&gt;import) means something different entirely.

   <b>Importing</b> <b>Parameter</b> <b>Coercion</b> <b>Methods</b>
       The second way of using Params::Coerce, and the more common one for Object-Oriented programming, is to
       create method specifically for taking parameters in a coercing manner.

         package My::Class;

         use URI ();
         use Params::Coerce '_URI' =&gt; 'URI';

         sub new {
               my $class = shift;

               # Take a URI as parameter
               my $URI1 = $class-&gt;_URI(shift) or return;
               my $URI2 = _URI(shift) or return;
               ...
         }

   <b>The</b> <b>"from"</b> <b>Constructor</b>
       From version 0.11 of "Params::Coerce", an additional mechanism is available with the importable "from"
       constructor.

         package My::Class;

         use Params::Coerce 'from';

         package Other::Class;

         sub method {
               my $self = shift;
               my $My   = My::Class-&gt;from(shift) or die "Bad param";
               ...
         }

       This is mainly a convenience. The above is equivalent to

         package My::Class;

         use Params::Coerce 'from' =&gt; 'Params::Coerce';

       In future versions, this "-&gt;from" syntax may also tweak the resolution order of the coercion.

   <b>Chained</b> <b>Coercion</b>
       While it is intended that Params::Coerce will eventually support coercion using multiple steps, like
       "&lt;Foo::Bar-"__as_HTML_Location-&gt;__as_URI&gt;&gt;, it is not currently capable of this. At this time only a
       single coercion step is supported.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>coerce</b> <b>$class,</b> <b>$param</b>
       The "coerce" function takes a class name and a single parameter and attempts to coerce the parameter into
       the intended class, or one of its subclasses.

       Please note that it is the responsibility of the consuming class to ensure that the class you wish to
       coerce to is loaded. "coerce" will check this and die is it is not loaded.

       Returns an instance of the class you specify, or one of its subclasses.  Returns "undef" if the parameter
       cannot be coerced into the class you wish.

</pre><h4><b>TO</b> <b>DO</b></h4><pre>
       - Write more unit tests

       - Implement chained coercion

       - Provide a way to coerce to string, int, etc that is compatible with overload and other types of things.
