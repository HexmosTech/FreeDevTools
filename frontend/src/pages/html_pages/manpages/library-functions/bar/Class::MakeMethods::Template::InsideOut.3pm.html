       Class::MakeMethods::Template::InsideOut - External data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Template::InsideOut (
           scalar          =&gt; [ 'foo', 'bar' ]
         );
         sub new { ... }

         package main;

         my $obj = MyObject-&gt;new( foo =&gt; "Foozle", bar =&gt; "Bozzle" );
         print $obj-&gt;foo();            # Prints Foozle
         $obj-&gt;bar("Bamboozle");       # Sets $obj's bar value

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Supports the Generic object constructor and accessors meta-method types, but accepts any object as the
       underlying implementation type, with member data stored in external indices.

       Each method stores the values associated with various objects in an hash keyed by the object's
       stringified identity. Since that hash is accessible only from the generated closures, it is impossible
       for foreign code to manipulate those values except through the method interface.

       A DESTROY method is installed to remove data for expired objects from the various hashes. (If the DESTROY
       method is not called, your program will not release this data and memory will be wasted.)

       <b>Common</b> <b>Parameters</b>: The following parameters are defined for InsideOut meta-methods.

       data
           An auto-vivified reference to a hash to be used to store the values for each object.

       Note  that using InsideOut meta-methods causes the installation of a DESTROY method in the calling class,
       which deallocates data for each instance when it is discarded.

       NOTE: This needs some more work to properly handle inheritance.

   <b>Standard</b> <b>Methods</b>
       The following methods from Generic are all supported:

         scalar
         string
         string_index *
         number
         boolean
         bits
         array
         hash
         tiedhash
         hash_of_arrays
         object
         instance
         array_of_objects
         code
         code_or_scalar

       See Class::MakeMethods::Template::Generic for the interfaces and behaviors of these method types.

       The items marked with a * above are specifically defined in this package, whereas the others  are  formed
       automatically  by  the interaction of this package's generic settings with the code templates provided by
       the Generic superclass.

   <b>boolean_index</b>
         boolean_index =&gt; [ qw / foo bar baz / ]

       Like InsideOut:boolean, boolean_index creates x, set_x, and clear_x methods. However, it also  defines  a
       class method find_x which returns a list of the objects which presently have the x-flag set to true.

       Note that to free items from memory, you must clear these bits!
