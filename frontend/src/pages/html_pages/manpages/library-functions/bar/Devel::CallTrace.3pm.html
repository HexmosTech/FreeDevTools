</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Devel::CallTrace - See what your code's doing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a> -d:CallTrace

       package foo;

       sub bar {
         print "bar\n";
         <b>baz()</b>; }

       sub baz {
           print "boo\n"; }

       <b>foo::bar()</b>;

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       There are a number of perl modules in the CPAN that are designed to trace a program's execution as it
       runs. Each uses a different trick to do its job, but none of them quite met my needs.  The technique this
       module uses is quite simple and seems to be quite robust.

   <b>DB::sub</b>
       perl will automatically call DB::sub on each subroutine call and leave it up to us to dispatch to where
       we want to go.

   <b>Devel::CallTrace::called</b>
       This routine is called with two parameters:

       DEPTH
           The integer "depth" that this call is being called at.

       PARAMS
           A reference to the routine's @INC

       To get at the subroutine that was being called, have a look at $DB::sub

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       It uses the debugger. How could it not have bugs?

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       perldebguts, DB, a licensed therapist.

       trace - Uses source filters. Scares me.

       Devel::TraceCalls - Very robust API. The code seems to do all sorts of scary magic

       Debug::Trace - Uses symbol table magic to wrap your functions.

       Devel::TRaceFuncs - Requires developers to instrument their source files.
