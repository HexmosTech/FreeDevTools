</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       note - a perl script for maintaining notes.

</pre><h4><b>SYNPOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       note [options] [ number [,number...]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>note</b> is a small console program written in perl, which allows you to manage notes similar to programs
       like "knotes" but from the command line. Note can use different database-backends for notes-storage. It
       ships with a DBI-based mysql-module(which can also be used for other by DBI supported DBMS), another
       module, which uses a binary file for storage and a DBM module.  There are also two modules available
       which uses a text file.  Note supports since version 1.0.0 encryption(IDEA or DES)!

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-c,</u> <u>--config</u> <u>file</u>
           Use another config file than the default <a href="file:~/.noterc.">~/.noterc.</a>

       <u>-l,</u> <u>--list</u> <u>[topic]</u>
           Lists  all existing notes. If no topic were specified, it will display a list of all existing topics.
           See the section <u>TOPICS</u> for details about topics.

       <u>-L,</u> <u>--longlist</u> <u>[topic]</u>
           The same as <u>-l</u> but prints also the timestamp of the notes.

       <u>-t,</u> <u>--topic</u>
           Prints a list of all topics as a tree.

       <u>-T,</u> <u>--longtopic</u>
           Prints the topic-tree with the notes under each topic.

       <u>-s,</u> <u>--search</u> <u>string</u>
           Searches for &lt;string&gt; trough the notes database. See the section  <u>SEARCHING</u>  for  details  about  the
           search engine.

       <u>-e,</u> <u>--edit</u> <u>number</u>
           Edit  the  note  with  the  number &lt;number&gt; using your default editor or the one you specified in the
           config file.

       <u>-d,</u> <u>--delete</u> <u>number</u>
           Delete the note with the number &lt;number&gt;. You can delete  multiple  notes  with  one  command.  "1-4"
           deletes the notes 1,2,3,4. And "1,5,7" deletes the specified ones.

       <u>-D,</u> <u>--Dump</u> <u>[file</u> <u>|</u> <u>-]</u>
           Dumps  all notes to the textfile &lt;file&gt;. If &lt;file&gt; is a "-" it will be printed out to standard output
           (STDOUT).

       <u>-I,</u> <u>--Import</u> <u>file</u> <u>|</u> <u>-</u>
           Imports a previously dumped textfile into the note database. Data will be appended by  default.   You
           can  also specify a dash <u>note</u> <u>-I</u> <u>-</u> instead of a &lt;file&gt;, which causes note, silently to read in a dump
           from STDIN.

       <u>-o,</u> <u>--overwrite</u>
           Only suitable for use with --Import. Overwrites an existing notedb. Use with care.

       <u>-r,</u> <u>--raw</u>
           Raw mode, output will not be formatted. Works not in interactive mode, only on cmd-line for list  and
           display. That means, no colors will be used and no lines or titles.

       <u>-i,</u> <u>--interactive</u>
           Start note in interactive mode. See the section <u>INTERACTIVE</u> <u>MODE</u> for details on this mode.

       <u>--encrypt</u> <u>cleartext</u>
           Encrypt  the given clear text string. You would need that if you want to store the mysql password not
           in cleartext in the config (if you are using the mysql backend!).

       <u>-h,</u> <u>--help</u>
           Display this help screen.

       <u>-v,</u> <u>--version</u>
           Display the version number.

       <b>-</b>   If you run note just with one dash: <b>note</b> <b>-</b>, then it will read in a new note  from  STDIN  until  EOF.
           This makes it possible to pipe text into a new note, i.e.:

            cat sometextfile | note -

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>GENERAL</b> <b>USAGE</b>
       If  you  don't  know,  how to run note, try "note -h" first.  It will tell you all available command line
       options.

       To create a new note, simply run "note". You can enter the note (the length is by default limited to 4096
       bytes, which you can change from your config file if you are using the binary backend, otherwise there is
       no limitation).  End by typing a . on a line itself. note will tell you the number of the note.

       If you want to view the note, type "note 1", if the notenumber was 1.

       If you want to get an overview of all notes, type  "note  -l".   You  will  get  a  list  of  all  notes,
       containing  the  number, the first line and the creation date. If topic-support is turned on (which is by
       default), then all subtopics under the current topic will be displayed first.  If you  want  to  see  the
       timestamps,  use  "-L"  instead  of "-l".  Read more about topics below in the section "Topics".  You can
       also specify the topic which notes you want to see: "-l mytopic" does the trick.  Additional,  you  might
       want  to  get an overview of your topic- structure. You can use the command "-t" in this case, which will
       display a tree-view of your topic-structure. You can use the command "-T" if you want to  see  the  notes
       under each topic too. "-T" will also show the number of each note.

       To edit a certain note, type "note -e 1". It will invoke your editor (vi or pico). You can edit it, after
       saving, note will store the changed note to the database.

       Of  course you can drop a certain note: "note -d 1" deletes note number 1. If a note in the middle or the
       beginning of the database will be deleted, note will recount the other existent notes. For example  there
       are 3 notes, number 1, 2 and 3. If you delete number 2, then number 3 will become number 2.  You can also
       make  use  of  the extended delete-syntax: To delete note 1 and 2, use "-d 1,2" To delete note 1,2 and 3,
       use "-d 1-3".

   <b>SEARCHING</b>
       If you cannot remember, which note you are looking for, you can use the search capability of note:  "note
       -s  &lt;searchstring&gt;".  note will search the whole note database case insensitive for an occurrence of this
       string and tell you the number and first- line it has.

       You can extend the searchstring using <b>AND</b>, <b>OR</b> ( and ) and shell-like wildcards:

        $ note -s "moses AND lenin"

       or:

        $ note -s "(mike OR arnold) AND (jackson OR schwarzenegger)"

       If note finds a note, which first line is a topic, then it will display it's second line.

       These rules apply for the interactive search too.

       You need to know, that note searches for the expression in every note. In other words, "moses AND  lenin"
       searches  for  an  occurrence  of  "moses"  and  "lenin" in ONE note. Or, if you are looking for "mike OR
       daniel", then it searches for an occurrence of "mike" or daniel" in ONE note. Thus a note with  the  text
       "mike oldfield" will match that search.

   <b>TOPICS</b>
       If  topic-support  is turned on (which is by default), the various notes are sorted under various topics.
       There is no special database field for the topic. Instead the topic will be stored right in the note.  If
       the first line of your note contains  some  text  bordered  by  slashes  (or  whatever  you  prefer,  set
       "TopicSeparator"  in  your  config!  default  is  slash), then note will consider it as the topic of this
       certain note. For examle:

        B&lt;/TodoList/&gt;

       If you are using topics, no data after the topic is allowed, if there is any text, note will consider  it
       as a subtopic! Therefore, don't for- get to put a newline after the topic-line.

       The  list-command  will  only  show  you  notes  under  this  topic.  If  you  create a new note, it will
       automagically inserted under the current topic (note will prepend  the string "/topicname/" to  the  text
       of your note).

       You  can  create  at any time from any point a new topic. Just create a new note and type the name of the
       new topic bordered by slashes (or TopicSeparator) at the first line of this  note.  After  saving,  there
       will be available a new topic with one note in it.

       You  can  create  as  many subtopics as you like, the format is similar to a filesystem-path. An example,
       say, you want to create such a structure:

        (root - top level)
        |
        |----test
        |      |----subtopic
        |      |       |--note 1
        |      |       |--note 2
        |      |
        |      |--note 4
        |
        |--note 3

       Then you may create those 4 new notes:

        --- snip ---
        /test/subtopic/
        note 1
        --- snip ---
        /test/subtopic/
        note 2
        --- snip ---
        note 3
        --- snip ---
        /test/
        note 4
        --- snip ---

       I hope, you got the point ;-)

       If a note does not contain the "magic" /topic/ construction on the first line, it will  be  listed  under
       the "root" of note, that is the point you are at the startup of note.

       You  can  subsequently  move a note without a topic to a certain topic.  Simply edit it and insert at the
       first line the above mentioned construction.

       Note: Please don't forget the prepending and appending a slash of a topic.  You will get strange  results
       without it!

   <b>INTERACTIVE</b> <b>MODE</b>
       If  you  start note with the command line flag <b>-i</b>, then it starts with an interactive interface.  It will
       start with a listing under the default top-topic ("/").  You can enter the name of a topic to  change  to
       that  topic. This works similar to a filesystem structure. The current topic will be displayed on the top
       of the screen.

       The following commands are available:

       <b>L</b> <b>[topic]</b>
           This command lists all notes with a timestamp. If you specify a topic, it will only  list  the  notes
           under this topic. If you are under a certain subtopic, then it will only display the notes under this
           topic.

       <b>l</b> <b>[topic]</b>
           This  commands  behaves similar to <b>L</b> but it does not display the timestamp.  You can achieve the same
           result by simply pressing enter at any time.

       <b>N</b>   You can create a new note by simply pressing <b>N</b> or <b>n</b>. You favorite editor will be started and you  can
           enter  your  note  text. If you are already under a topic then this new note will automatically go to
           this topic.  note adds an additional line to the top of the note with the  topic.  But  you  can,  of
           course, specify your own topic.

           Note will tell you which number it has assigned to the newly created note.

       <b>E</b> <b>number</b>
           By  entering  <b>E</b> or <b>e</b> and a note-number you can edit an existing note using your favorite editor. This
           way you can also move an existing note from one topic to another one by editing the first line of the
           note.

       <b>D</b> <b>number</b>
           <b>E</b> or <b>e</b> deletes one or more existing note(s). It requires a note number or a set of note numbers.  1-5
           and  1,7,9  are  possible  values.   After  one  or more notes has been deleted note will recount all
           remaining notes.  Say if you delete 1 and 2, then 3 will become 1, 4 will become 5 and so forth.

       <b>S</b> <b>[expression]</b>
           You can search for the occurrence of a text in your notes-database with the command <b>S</b> or  <b>s</b>.  If  you
           omit an expression note will ask you for one.

           If  your  search  criteria matches on exactly one entry, note will display that note entry instead of
           displaying its number.

       <b>T</b>   This prints a tree-view of your topic-structure. <b>T</b> displays the tree with notes, <b>t</b> displays just  the
           topics without notes.

       <b>C</b>   It  is  possible  to  change  note's  behavior at runtime. Specify the parameter you'd like to modify
           followed by equalsign and the new value. Use with care! However, database related  parameters  cannot
           be changed at runtime.  Entering just "c" without parameters displays the customizable variables.

       <b>cd</b> <b>topic</b>
           Change the actual topic under which you are. This works identical like just entering the topic but it
           has  some  advantages. You can enter <b>cd</b> <b>..</b> if you want to go one level up in the topic-structure. And
           you can enter <b>cd</b> <b>/</b> to go to the top of the structure. You can always leave out the 'cd' keyword too.

           Additional it is possible to enter a note-number instead of a topic name.  For  this  feature  to  be
           active  you  need to set the config option <b>ShortCd</b> to <b>1</b> or <b>yes</b>. If you use a number and the note with
           this number is under a certain topic then you will "cd" to this topic. This allows you to do kind  of
           jumps over multiple levels of topics.

           If  is  possible  to  abbreviate  a  topic. This works only if the abbreviation matches on one single
           topic. If it matches more than one topic then the available ones will be suggested.

       <b>?</b> <b>or</b> <b>h</b>
           Display a short help screen.

       <b>Q</b>   Quit note.

   <b>BACKUP</b>
       You can also dump the contents of your note-database into a ASCII-textfile(<u>-D</u>). You  can  use  this  file
       later to import it into your note-database(-I). This is useful, if you want quickly trans- fer your notes
       from one host to another (i.e. you could mail your note-dump form your office to home and import it there
       for further use).

       The  dumps  from  the  two  versions  of note are in the same format.  Using dumps it is also possible to
       reinitialize your database. You can use the "-o" switch which causes  note  to  overwrite  your  existing
       database.  This  is  very  handy  if you changed heavily your config. And it is required, if you changed:
       encryption, db-driver,  (binary-format)  and  the  password.  You  can  use  the  following  command  for
       reinitializing:

        $ note -D - | note -o -I -

       What the hell, does this do?! Step by step:

       •   <b>note</b> <b>-D</b> <b>-</b> creates a note-database dump and prints it out to standard output.

       •   <b>|</b> this is the shell's pipe command. It takes the output of the left program and gives it to the right
           program as standard input.

       •   <b>note</b> <b>-o</b> <b>-I</b> <b>-</b> imports a note-database dump from standard input and overwrites an existing database.

       Before you use the <b>-o</b> switch, I consider you to make a backup!

       <u>BACKUP</u> <u>FILE</u> <u>FORMAT</u>

       <b>Caution</b>:  since  version  1.3.8  note  uses  a  new file format for backups: YAML. The old format is only
       supported by the <b>-I</b> option to import old backups. New backups are always created as YAML files. See YAML.

   <b>FORMATING</b>
       Another very nice feature is the possibility to format the note-text (as much as shell allows it). First,
       you can use the note-internal "magic-strings"  for  colorizing.  Those  strings  looks  much  like  HTML:
       "&lt;green&gt;here  is a green line of text&lt;/green&gt; no more green."  As you see, the beginning of another color
       starts with a tag(kinda) of the color &lt;colorname&gt; and ends with an end tag &lt;/colorname&gt;.

       The following colors are available: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white.

       Beside colorizing text, you can also  create  bold  or  underlined  text!  If  you  decide  to  use  this
       (additional)  feature,  you  need to set the Config-Option "FormatText" to 1 which turns it on.  Usage is
       very straightforward, if a word (a word is defined as some text with at least one  space  surrounded)  is
       between a magic mark- character. Here are the available things, you can do:

        bold:       **word**
        underlined: __word__
        inverse:    {{word}}
        hidden:     //word//

       The text will be formatted using the actually note-color.

       The  hidden  formatting  will use blue foreground and blue background to hide a string from the terminal,
       which is useful for passwords.

       If you set "FormatText" to <u>simple</u> then the formatting can be done this way instead:

        bold:       *word*
        underlined: _word_
        inverse:    {word}
        hidden:     /word/

</pre><h4><b>ENCRYPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You can turn on encryption from the config file.  Simply set UseEncryption to 1. Please  note,  that  you
       need  to  decide,  if  you  want  to  use encryption before the first use of note! If have already a note
       database and want to "migrate" to encryption, I suggest you to follow the directions in the file UPGRADE!

       You can choose from different encryption algorythms. The default is IDEA, but DES or  BLOWFISH  are  also
       possible.  You  need  to  have  installed  the  following  additional  perl-modules  on  your system: MD5
       Crypt::IDEA Crypt::DES Crypt::CBC

       After turning on encryption, note will ask you for a passphrase every time it runs! It will  *not*  store
       this passphrase!  So, don't forget it! Be careful!

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       You can use a configuration file with note but it is not required.  Note will use default values if there
       is no config.

       The default config file is <b><a href="file:~/.noterc">~/.noterc</a></b>. You may specify another one with the command line flag <u>--config</u>.

       Comments start with #, empty lines will be ignored.

       To turn on an option, set it to: <b>1</b>, <b>on</b> or <b>yes</b>.

       To turn off an option, set it to: <b>0</b>, <b>off</b> or <b>no</b>.

       An  option consists of an atribute-value pair separated by minimum one space (more spaces and/or tabs are
       allowed) and an optional equal sign in between.

       Variable names are case in-sensitive.

       For a detailed explanation of each possible parameter take a look at the  supplied  sample  configuration
       file in <b>config/noterc</b>.
