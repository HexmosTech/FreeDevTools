</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PCMPXY - This routine is normally not called directly by the user (though it can be). It is called by
       each of the routines PCHIQU, PCMEQU, and PCLOQU when the user has set the mapping flag ´MA´ nonzero to
       request mapping of characters from one X/Y coordinate system to another.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL PCMPXY (IMAP,XINP,YINP,XOTP,YOTP)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;
       void c_pcmpxy (int imap, float xinp, float yinp, float *xotp, float *yotp)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       IMAP        (an  input  expression  of  type  INTEGER)  specifies  which  mapping is to be done. Whenever
                   Plotchar routines call PCMPXY, IMAP = ´MA´. The default  version  of  PCMPXY  recognizes  the
                   following values of IMAP:

                   IMAP = 0

                          Type of mapping
                             None.  When  IMAP  is zero, the routine PCMPXY is being asked for information about
                             its capabilities with respect to a particular mapping.

                          XINP
                             Input: the real equivalent of a possible value of IMAP about which  information  is
                             desired.

                          YINP
                             Output  (real):  0.  says  that  the mapping specified by XINP is not available, 1.
                             that it is available, 2. that its inverse is available, and 3. that both it and its
                             inverse are available.

                   IMAP = 1

                          Type of mapping
                             Ezmap projection.

                          XINP
                             Longitude, in degrees.

                          YINP
                             Latitude, in degrees.

                   IMAP = 2

                          Type of mapping
                             Rho/theta mapping.

                          XINP
                             Rho, in user units.

                          YINP
                             Theta, in degrees.

                   IMAP = 3

                          Type of mapping
                             Projection from an arbitrary parallelogram in 3-space to an image  plane.  This  is
                             implemented  using  a  package  which is currently under development and is not yet
                             generally available.

                          XINP
                             A multiplier for a unit vector along one edge of the parallelogram.

                          YINP
                             A multiplier for a unit vector along an intersecting edge of the parallelogram.

                   IMAP = 4

                          Type of mapping
                             A version of the EZMAP projection that is intended to be  used  to  label  specific
                             points  on  the  surface  of  the  globe.   When 'MA' = 4, use "0." for each of the
                             arguments XPOS, YPOS, and ANGD in calls to  PCHIQU  and  PCMEQU.   Initially,  each
                             label  is  assumed  to  be  placed at the point on the globe with latitude zero and
                             longitude zero and to be written along  the  equator.   Three  rotations  are  then
                             performed to move the label to the point (PLAT,PLON) in such a way that it makes an
                             angle  PANG  with  the  local eastward-pointing vector.  Finally, the EZMAP routine
                             MAPTRA is called to project the label as specified by the current state  of  EZMAP.
                             The desired values of PANG, PLAT, and PLON (in degrees) are passed to PCMPXY in the
                             labelled  common  block  PCMP04, which contains just those three variables, in that
                             order.  Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant example: cpex10.

                          XINP
                             Longitude, in degrees.

                          YINP
                             Latitude, in degrees.

                   IMAP = 100

                          Type of mapping
                             The identity mapping, but returns 1.E12 outside a specified viewport. Used  by  the
                             utility Scrolled_title to do clipping at the edges of the viewport.

                          XINP
                             X coordinate, in the fractional system.

                          YINP
                             Y coordinate, in the fractional system.

                   other &gt; 0

                          Type of mapping
                             The identity mapping.

                          XINP
                             Any real value.

                          YINP
                             Any real value.

                   other &lt; 0

                          Type of mapping
                             An inverse mapping.

                          XINP
                             A mapped X coordinate.

                          YINP
                             A mapped Y coordinate.

                   Note: Values of IMAP less than or equal to zero are not currently used by Plotchar in calling
                   PCMPXY.  The  scheme  described  is the same as that used for the routine CPMPXY, in the NCAR
                   Graphics package Conpack. It is possible that, in the future, values of  IMAP  less  than  or
                   equal to zero will occur in calls to PCMPXY, so it is best to be prepared.

       XINP and YINP
                   (input expressions of type REAL) specify the X and Y coordinates of a point to be mapped.

                   Note: When IMAP is less than or equal to zero (which cannot currently happen, but may someday
                   be possible), XINP and YINP are used differently, as shown above.

       XOTP and YOTP
                   (output variables of type REAL) in which PCMPXY returns the mapped X and Y coordinates of the
                   point.   If  the  point  is not visible under the mapping selected (as, for example, when the
                   orthographic projection of Ezmap is being used and the point to be mapped  is  on  the  other
                   side  of  the globe), PCMPXY must return, as a signal that this is the case, whatever special
                   nonzero value has been given to the internal parameter ´OR´, so that the calling routine  can
                   take appropriate action (to properly clip the character being drawn, for example).

                   Note: When IMAP is less than or equal to zero (which cannot currently happen, but may someday
                   be possible), XOTP and YOTP are used differently, as shown in the table above.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       This  routine is normally not called directly by the user (though it can be). It is called by each of the
       routines PCHIQU, PCMEQU, and PCLOQU when the user has set  the  mapping  flag  ´MA´  nonzero  to  request
       mapping of characters from one X/Y coordinate system to another. A call to PCMPXY has the following form:

            CALL PCMPXY (IMAP,XINP,YINP,XOTP,YOTP)

       The default version of PCMPXY does several useful mappings; a user version may be supplied to do others.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use PCMPXY or c_pcmpxy, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.
