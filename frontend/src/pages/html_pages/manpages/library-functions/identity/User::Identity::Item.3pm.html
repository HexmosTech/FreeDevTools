</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       User::Identity::Item - general base class for User::Identity

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
        User::Identity::Item is extended by
          Mail::Identity
          User::Identity
          User::Identity::Archive
          User::Identity::Collection
          User::Identity::Location
          User::Identity::System

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "User::Identity::Item" base class is extended into useful modules: it has no use by its own.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Constructors</b>
       User::Identity::Item-&gt;<b>new</b>( [$name], %options )
            -Option     --Default
             description  undef
             name         &lt;required&gt;
             parent       undef

           description =&gt; STRING
             Free format description on the collected item.

           name =&gt; STRING
             A simple name for this item.  Try to give a useful name in the context of the item time.  Each time
             when  you  lookup  items,  you need to specify this name, so it should be unique and not to hard to
             handle in your program.  For instance, when a person is addressed, you usually  will  give  him/her
             this a nickname.

           parent =&gt; OBJECT
             The encapsulating object: the object which collects this one.

   <b>Attributes</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>description</b>()
           Free  format  description  on  this  item.  Please do not add any significance to the content of this
           field: if you are in need for an extra  attribute,  please  contact  the  author  of  the  module  to
           implement it, or extend the object to suit your needs.

       $obj-&gt;<b>name</b>( [$newname] )
           The  name  of  this item.  Names are unique within a collection... a second object with the same name
           within any collection will destroy the already existing object with that name.

           Changing   the   name   of   an   item   is   quite   dangerous.    You   probably   want   to   call
           <b>User::Identity::Collection::renameRole()</b> instead.

   <b>Collections</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>add</b>($collection, $role)
           The  $role  is  added to the $collection.  The $collection is the name of a collection, which will be
           created automatically with <b>addCollection()</b> if needed.  The  $collection  can  also  be  specified  as
           existing collection object.

           The  $role  is anything what is acceptable to <b>User::Identity::Collection::addRole()</b> of the collection
           at hand, and is returned.  $role typically is a list of parameters for one role, or a reference to an
           array containing these values.

           example:

            my $ui   = User::Identity-&gt;new(...);
            my $home = $ui-&gt;add(location =&gt; [home =&gt; street =&gt; '27 Roadstreet', ...] );
            my $work = $ui-&gt;add(location =&gt; work, tel =&gt; '+31-2231-342-13', ... );

            my $travel = User::Identity::Location-&gt;new(travel =&gt; ...);
            $ui-&gt;add(location =&gt; $travel);

            my $system = User::Identity::Collection::System-&gt;new(...);
            $ui-&gt;add($system =&gt; 'localhost');

       $obj-&gt;<b>addCollection</b>( $object | &lt;[$type], %options&gt; )
           Add a new collection of roles to an item.  This can  be  achieved  in  two  ways:  either  create  an
           User::Identity::Collection  $object  yourself  and  then  pass that to this method, or supply all the
           %options needed to create such an object and it will be created for you.  The object which  is  added
           is returned, and can be used for many methods directly.

           For %options, see the specific type of collection.  Additional options are listed below.

            -Option--Default
             type    &lt;required&gt;

           type =&gt; STRING|CLASS
             The  nickname of a collection class or the CLASS name itself of the object to be created.  Required
             if an object has to be created.  Predefined type nicknames are "email", "system", and "location".

           example:

            my $me   = User::Identity-&gt;new(...);
            my $locs = User::Identity::Collection::Locations-&gt;new();
            $me-&gt;addCollection($locs);

            my $email = $me-&gt;addCollection(type =&gt; 'email');
            my $email = $me-&gt;addCollection('email');

       $obj-&gt;<b>collection</b>($name)
           In scalar context the collection object with the $name is returned.  In list context, all  the  roles
           within the collection are returned.

           example:

            my @roles = $me-&gt;collection('email');        # list of collected items
            my @roles = $me-&gt;collection('email')-&gt;roles; # same of collected items
            my $coll  = $me-&gt;collection('email');        # a User::Identity::Collection

       $obj-&gt;<b>parent</b>( [$parent] )
           Returns  the parent of an Item (the enclosing item).  This may return "undef" if the object is stand-
           alone.

       $obj-&gt;<b>removeCollection</b>($object|$name)
       $obj-&gt;<b>type</b>()
       User::Identity::Item-&gt;<b>type</b>()
           Returns a nice symbolic name for the type.

       $obj-&gt;<b>user</b>()
           Go from this object to its parent, to its parent, and so on, until a User::Identity is found  or  the
           top of the object tree has been reached.

           example:

            print $email-&gt;user-&gt;fullName;

   <b>Searching</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>find</b>($collection, $role)
           Returns  the  object  with  the  specified  $role within the named collection.  The collection can be
           specified as name or object.

           example:

            my $role  = $me-&gt;find(location =&gt; 'work');       # one location
            my $role  = $me-&gt;collection('location')-&gt;find('work'); # same

            my $email = $me-&gt;addCollection('email');
            $me-&gt;find($email =&gt; 'work');
            $email-&gt;find('work');   # same

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Error: $object is not a collection.
           The first argument is an object, but not of a class which extends User::Identity::Collection.

       Error: Cannot load collection module for $type ($class).
           Either the specified $type does not exist, or that module named $class  returns  compilation  errors.
           If  the type as specified in the warning is not the name of a package, you specified a nickname which
           was not defined.  Maybe you forgot the 'require' the package which defines the nickname.

       Error: Creation of a collection via $class failed.
           The $class did compile, but it was not possible to create an object of that class using  the  options
           you specified.

       Error: Don't know what type of collection you want to add.
           If you add a collection, it must either by a collection object or a list of options which can be used
           to create a collection object.  In the latter case, the type of collection must be specified.

       Error: Each item requires a name
           You  have  to specify a name for each item.  These names need to be unique within one collection, but
           feel free to give the same name to an e-mail address and a location.

       Warning: No collection $name
           The collection with $name does not exist and can not be created.

       Warning: Unknown option $name for a $class
           One used option is not defined.  Check the manual  page  of  the  class  to  see  which  options  are
           accepted.

       Warning: Unknown options @names for a $class
           More than one option is not defined.
