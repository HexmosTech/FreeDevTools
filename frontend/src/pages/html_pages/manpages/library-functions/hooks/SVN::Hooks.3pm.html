</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SVN::Hooks - Framework for implementing Subversion hooks

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.36

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       A single script can implement several hooks:

               #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>

               use SVN::Hooks;

               START_COMMIT {
                   my ($repo_path, $username, $capabilities, $txn_name) = @_;
                   # ...
               };

               PRE_COMMIT {
                   my ($svnlook) = @_;
                   # ...
               };

               run_hook($0, @ARGV);

       Or you can use already implemented hooks via plugins:

               #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>

               use SVN::Hooks;
               use SVN::Hooks::DenyFilenames;
               use SVN::Hooks::DenyChanges;
               use SVN::Hooks::CheckProperty;
               ...

               run_hook($0, @ARGV);

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       In order to really understand what this is all about you need to understand Subversion
       &lt;<a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">http://subversion.apache.org/</a>&gt; and its hooks. You can read everything about this in the svnbook, a.k.a.
       Version Control with Subversion, at &lt;<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/index.html">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/index.html</a>&gt;.

       Subversion is a version control system, and as such it is used to keep historical revisions of files and
       directories. Each revision maintains information about all the changes introduced since the previous one:
       date, author, log message, files changed, files renamed, etc.

       Subversion uses a client/server model. The server maintains the <b>repository</b>, which is the database
       containing all the historical information we talked about above. Users use a Subversion client tool to
       query and change the repository but also to maintain one or more <b>working</b> <b>areas</b>. A working area is a
       directory in the user machine containing a copy of a particular revision of the repository. The user can
       use the client tool to make all sorts of changes in his working area and to "commit" them all in an
       atomic operation that bumps the repository to a new revision.

       A hook is a specifically named program that is called by the Subversion server during the execution of
       some operations. There are exactly nine hooks which must reside under the "hooks" directory in the
       repository. When you create a new repository, you get nine template files in this directory, all of them
       having the ".tmpl" suffix and helpful instructions inside explaining how to convert them into working
       hooks.

       When Subversion is performing a commit operation on behalf of a client, for example, it calls the
       "start-commit" hook, then the "pre-commit" hook, and then the "post-commit" hook. The first two can
       gather all sorts of information about the specific commit transaction being performed and decide to
       reject it in case it doesn't comply to specified policies. The "post-commit" can be used to log or alert
       interested parties about the commit just done.

       IMPORTANT NOTE from the svnbook: "For security reasons, the Subversion repository executes hook programs
       with an empty environment---that is, no environment variables are set at all, not even $PATH (or %PATH%,
       under Windows). Because of this, many administrators are baffled when their hook program runs fine by
       hand, but doesn't work when run by Subversion. Be sure to explicitly set any necessary environment
       variables in your hook program and/or use absolute paths to programs."

       Not even the current directory where the hooks run is specified by Subversion. However, the hooks
       executed by the SVN::Hooks framework run with their currect directory set to the repository's root
       directory in the server. This can be useful sometimes.

       There are several useful hook scripts available elsewhere
       &lt;<a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/contrib/hook-scripts/">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/contrib/hook-scripts/</a>&gt;, mainly for those three
       associated with the commit operation. However, when you try to combine the functionality of two or more
       of those scripts in a single hook you normally end up facing two problems.

       <b>Complexity</b>
           In  order  to  integrate  the  funcionality of more than one script you have to write a driver script
           that's called by Subversion and calls all the other scripts in order, passing to them  the  arguments
           they  need.  Moreover, some of those scripts may have configuration files to read and you may have to
           maintain several of them.

       <b>Inefficiency</b>
           This arrangement is inefficient in two ways. First because each script runs as  a  separate  process,
           which  usually have a high startup cost because they are, well, scripts and not binaries. And second,
           because as each script is called in turn they have no memory of the scripts called before and have to
           gather the information about the transaction again and  again,  normally  by  calling  the  "svnlook"
           command, which spawns yet another process.

       SVN::Hooks is a framework for implementing Subversion hooks that tries to solve these problems.

       Instead  of  having  separate  scripts  implementing  different  functionality  you  have a single script
       implementing all the funcionality you need either directly or using some of the existing  plugins,  which
       are  implemented  by  Perl  modules  in  the  SVN::Hooks::  namespace.  This single script can be used to
       implement all nine standard hooks, because each hook knows when to perform based on the context in  which
       the script was called.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  Subversion  server,  go  to  the  "hooks" directory under the directory where the repository was
       created. You should see there the nine hook templates. Create a script there using the SVN::Hooks module.

               $ cd /path/to/repo/hooks

               $ cat &gt;svn-hooks.pl &lt;&lt;END_OF_SCRIPT
               #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>

               use SVN::Hooks;

               run_hook($0, @ARGV);

               END_OF_SCRIPT

               $ chmod +x svn-hooks.pl

       This script will serve for any hook. Create  symbolic  links  pointing  to  it  for  each  hook  you  are
       interested  in. (You may create symbolic links for all nine hooks, but this will make Subversion call the
       script for all hooked operations, even for those that you may not be interested in.  Nothing  wrong  will
       happen, but the server will be doing extra work for nothing.)

               $ ln -s svn-hooks.pl start-commit
               $ ln -s svn-hooks.pl pre-commit
               $ ln -s svn-hooks.pl post-commit
               $ ln -s svn-hooks.pl pre-revprop-change

       As  is  the  script  won't do anything. You have to implement some hooks or use some of the existing ones
       implemented as plugins. Either way, the script should end with a call to "run_hooks" passing  to  it  the
       name with which it wass called ($0) and all the arguments it received (@ARGV).

   <b>Implementing</b> <b>Hooks</b>
       Implement  hooks  using  one  of  the  nine  hook  <u>directives</u>  below. Each one of them get a single block
       (anonymous function) as argument. The block will be  called  by  "run_hook"  with  proper  arguments,  as
       indicated  below.  These  arguments  are  the  ones  gotten  from  @ARGV,  with the exception of the ones
       identified by "SVN::Look". These are SVN::Look objects which can be used  to  grok  detailed  information
       about  the  repository and the current transaction. (Please, refer to the SVN::Look documentation to know
       how to use it.)

       •   POST_COMMIT(SVN::Look)

       •   POST_LOCK(repos-path, username)

       •   POST_REVPROP_CHANGE(SVN::Look, username, property-name, action)

       •   POST_UNLOCK(repos-path, username)

       •   PRE_COMMIT(SVN::Look)

       •   PRE_LOCK(repos-path, path, username, comment, steal-lock-flag)

       •   PRE_REVPROP_CHANGE(SVN::Look, username, property-name, action)

       •   PRE_UNLOCK(repos-path, path, username, lock-token, break-unlock-flag)

       •   START_COMMIT(repos-path, username, capabilities, txn-name)

       This is an example of a script implementing two hooks:

               #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>

               use SVN::Hooks;

               # ...

               START_COMMIT {
                   my ($repos_path, $username, $capabilities, $txn_name) = @_;

                   exists $committers{$username}
                       or die "User '$username' is not allowed to commit.\n";

                   $capabilities =~ /mergeinfo/
                       or die "Your Subversion client does not support mergeinfo capability.\n";
               };

               PRE_COMMIT {
                   my ($svnlook) = @_;

                   foreach my $added ($svnlook-&gt;added()) {
                       $added !~ /\.(exe|o|jar|zip)$/
                           or die "Please, don't commit binary files such as '$added'.\n";
                   }
               };

               run_hook($0, @ARGV);

       Note that the hook directives resemble function definitions but they're not. They are function calls, and
       as such must end with a semi-colon.

       Most of the "start-commit" and "pre-*" hooks are used to check some condition. If  the  condition  holds,
       they  must  simply  end  without  returning  anything.  Otherwise,  they must "die" with a suitable error
       message.

       Also note that each hook directive can be called more than once if you need to implement  more  than  one
       specific hook. The hooks will run in the order they were defined.

   <b>Using</b> <b>Plugins</b>
       There  are  several hooks already implemented as plugin modules under the namespace "SVN::Hooks::", which
       you can use. The main ones are described succinctly below. Please, see their own documentation  for  more
       details.

       SVN::Hooks::AllowPropChange
           Allow only specified users make changes in revision properties.

       SVN::Hooks::CheckCapability
           Check if the Subversion client implements the required capabilities.

       SVN::Hooks::CheckJira
           Integrate Subversion with the JIRA &lt;<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/</a>&gt; ticketing system.

       SVN::Hooks::CheckLog
           Check if the log message in a commit conforms to a Regexp.

       SVN::Hooks::CheckMimeTypes
           Check  if the files added to the repository have the "svn:mime-type" property set. Moreover, for text
           files, check if the properties "svn:eol-style" and "svn:keywords" are also set.

       SVN::Hooks::CheckProperty
           Check for specific properties for specific kinds of files.

       SVN::Hooks::CheckStructure
           Check if the files and directories being added to the repository conform to a specific structure.

       SVN::Hooks::DenyChanges
           Deny the addition, modification, or deletion of specific files and  directories  in  the  repository.
           Usually used to deny modifications in the "tags" directory.

       SVN::Hooks::DenyFilenames
           Deny  the  addition  of files which file names doesn't comply with a Regexp. Usually used to disallow
           some characteres in the filenames.

       SVN::Hooks::Notify
           Sends notification emails after successful commits.

       SVN::Hooks::UpdateConfFile
           Allows you to maintain Subversion configuration files versioned in the same repository where they are
           used. Usually used to maintain the configuration file for the hooks and the repository access control
           file.

       This is an example of a script using some plugins:

               #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>

               use SVN::Hooks;
               use SVN::Hooks::CheckProperty;
               use SVN::Hooks::DenyChanges;
               use SVN::Hooks::DenyFilenames;

               # Accept only letters, digits, underlines, periods, and hifens
               DENY_FILENAMES(qr/[^-\/\.\w]/i);

               # Disallow modifications in the tags directory
               DENY_UPDATE(qr:^tags:);

               # OpenOffice.org documents need locks
               CHECK_PROPERTY(qr/\.(?:od[bcfgimpst]|ot[ghpst])$/i =&gt; 'svn:needs-lock');

               run_hook($0, @ARGV);

       Those directives are implemented and exported by the hooks. Note that using hooks you don't  need  to  be
       explicit  about  which  one  of  the  nine hooks will be triggered by the directives. This is on purpose,
       because some plugins can trigger more than one hook. The plugin documentation should tell you which hooks
       can be triggered so that you know which symbolic links  you  need  to  create  in  the  <u>hooks</u>  repository
       directory.

   <b>Configuration</b> <b>file</b>
       Before  calling  the hooks, the function "run_hook" evaluates a file called <u>svn-hooks.conf</u> under the <u>conf</u>
       directory in the repository, if it exists. Hence, you can choose to put all the directives in  this  file
       and not in the script under the <u>hooks</u> directory.

       The   advantage   of   this   is   that   you   can   then   manage   the  configuration  file  with  the
       "SVN::Hooks::UpdateConfFile" and have it versioned under the same repository that it controls.

       One way to do this is to use this hook script:

               #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>

               use SVN::Hooks;
               use SVN::Hooks::UpdateConfFile;
               use ...

               UPDATE_CONF_FILE(
                   'conf/svn-hooks.conf' =&gt; 'svn-hooks.conf',
                   validator             =&gt; [qw(<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a> -c)],
                   rotate                =&gt; 2,
               );

               run_hook($0, @ARGV);

       Use this hook script and create a directory called <u>conf</u> at the root of the repository (besides the common
       <u>trunk</u>, <u>branches</u>, and <u>tags</u> directories). Add the <u>svn-hooks.conf</u>  file  under  the  <u>conf</u>  directory.  Then,
       whenever  you  commit  a  new  version  of  the  file, the pre-commit hook will validate it sintactically
       ("<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a> -c") and copy its new version to the <u>conf/svn-hooks.conf</u> file in  the  repository.  (Read
       the SVN::Hooks::UpdateConfFile documentation to understand it in details.)

       Being  a Perl script, it's possible to get fancy with the configuration file, using variables, functions,
       and whatever. But for most purposes it consists just in a series of configuration directives.

       Don't forget to end it with the "1;" statement, though, because it's evaluated with a "do" statement  and
       needs to end with a true expression.

       Please, see the plugins documentation to know about the directives.

</pre><h4><b>PLUGIN</b> <b>DEVELOPER</b> <b>TUTORIAL</b></h4><pre>
       Yet to do.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>run_hook</b>
       This is responsible to invoke the right plugins depending on the context in which it was called.

       Its first argument must be the name of the hook that was called. Usually you just pass $0 to it, since it
       knows to extract the basename of the parameter.

       Its second argument must be the path to the directory where the repository was created.

       The remaining arguments depend on the hook for which it's being called, like this:

       •   start-commit repo-path user capabilities txn-name

       •   pre-commit repo-path txn

       •   post-commit repo-path rev

       •   pre-lock repo-path path user

       •   post-lock repo-path user

       •   pre-unlock repo-path path user

       •   post-unlock repo-path user

       •   pre-revprop-change repo-path rev user propname action

       •   post-revprop-change repo-path rev user propname action

       But  as  these  are  exactly  the  arguments  Subversion passes when it calls the hooks, you usually call
       "run_hook" like this:

               run_hook($0, @ARGV);
