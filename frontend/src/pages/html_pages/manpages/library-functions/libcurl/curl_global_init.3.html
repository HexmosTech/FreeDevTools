       curl_global_init - global libcurl initialization

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;

       CURLcode curl_global_init(long flags);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  function  sets  up  the  program environment that libcurl needs. Think of it as an extension of the
       library loader.

       This function must be called at least once within a program (a program is all  the  code  that  shares  a
       memory  space)  before  the  program  calls  any other function in libcurl. The environment it sets up is
       constant for the life of the program and is the same for every program, so multiple calls have  the  same
       effect as one call.

       The  flags  option is a bit pattern that tells libcurl exactly what features to init, as described below.
       Set  the  desired  bits  by  ORing  the  values  together.   In  normal  operation,  you   must   specify
       CURL_GLOBAL_ALL.  Do not use any other value unless you are familiar with it and mean to control internal
       operations of libcurl.

       This function is thread-safe on most platforms. Then <u><a href="../man3/curl_version_info.3.html">curl_version_info</a>(3)</u> has the <u>threadsafe</u> feature  set
       (added in 7.84.0).

       If this is not thread-safe (the bit mentioned above is not set), you must not call this function when any
       other  thread  in the program (i.e. a thread sharing the same memory) is running. This does not just mean
       no other thread that is using libcurl. Because <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_init.3.html">curl_global_init</a>(3)</u> calls  functions  of  other  libraries
       that  are  similarly  thread  unsafe,  it  could  conflict  with  any  other thread that uses these other
       libraries.

       If you are initializing libcurl from a Windows DLL you should not initialize it from <u>DllMain</u> or a  static
       initializer because Windows holds the loader lock during that time and it could cause a deadlock.

       See  the  description  in  <u><a href="../man3/libcurl.3.html">libcurl</a>(3)</u>  of  global environment requirements for details of how to use this
       function.

</pre><h4><b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       CURL_GLOBAL_ALL
              Initialize everything possible. This sets all known bits except <b>CURL_GLOBAL_ACK_EINTR</b>.

       CURL_GLOBAL_SSL
              (This flag's presence or absence serves no meaning since 7.57.0.  The  description  below  is  for
              older libcurl versions.)

              Initialize SSL.

              The  implication here is that if this bit is not set, the initialization of the SSL layer needs to
              be done by the application or at least outside of libcurl. The  exact  procedure  how  to  do  SSL
              initialization depends on the TLS backend libcurl uses.

              Doing  TLS  based  transfers  without  having  the  TLS  layer  initialized may lead to unexpected
              behaviors.

       CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32
              Initialize the Win32 socket libraries.

              The implication here is that if this bit is not set, the initialization of Winsock has to be  done
              by  the  application  or  you  risk  getting  undefined behaviors. This option exists for when the
              initialization is handled outside of libcurl so there is no need for libcurl to do it again.

       CURL_GLOBAL_NOTHING
              Initialize nothing extra. This sets no bit.

       CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT
              A sensible default. It initializes both SSL and Win32. Right now, this equals the functionality of
              the <b>CURL_GLOBAL_ALL</b> mask.

       CURL_GLOBAL_ACK_EINTR
              This bit has no point since 7.69.0 but its behavior is instead the default.

              Before 7.69.0: when this flag is set, curl acknowledges EINTR condition when  connecting  or  when
              waiting for data. Otherwise, curl waits until full timeout elapses. (Added in 7.30.0)

</pre><h4><b>PROTOCOLS</b></h4><pre>
       This functionality affects all supported protocols

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       int main(void)
       {
         curl_global_init(CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT);

         /* use libcurl, then before exiting... */

         curl_global_cleanup();
       }

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Added in curl 7.8

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       If this function returns non-zero, something went wrong and you cannot use the other curl functions.
