</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       libcurl-env - environment variables libcurl understands

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       libcurl  reads and understands a set of environment variables that if set controls and changes behaviors.
       This is the full list of variables to set and description of what they  do.  Also  note  that  curl,  the
       command line tool, supports a set of additional environment variables independently of this.

       [scheme]_proxy
              When  libcurl  is given a URL to use in a transfer, it first extracts the scheme part from the URL
              and checks if there is a given proxy set for that in its corresponding environment variable. A URL
              like  https://example.com  makes  libcurl  use  the  <b>http_proxy</b>  variable,  while   a   URL   like
              <a href="ftp://example.com">ftp://example.com</a> uses the <b>ftp_proxy</b> variable.

              These  proxy variables are also checked for in their uppercase versions, except the <b>http_proxy</b> one
              which is only used lowercase. Note also  that  some  systems  actually  have  a  case  insensitive
              handling of environment variables and then of course <b>HTTP_PROXY</b> still works.

              An  exception exists for the WebSocket <b>ws</b> and <b>wss</b> URL schemes, where libcurl first checks <b>ws_proxy</b>
              or <b>wss_proxy</b> but if they are not set, it falls back and tries the http and https versions  instead
              if set.

       ALL_PROXY
              This is a setting to set proxy for all URLs, independently of what scheme is being used. Note that
              the scheme specific variables overrides this one if set.

       CURL_SSL_BACKEND
              When  libcurl  is  built  to support multiple SSL backends, it selects a specific backend at first
              use. If no selection is done by the program using libcurl,  this  variable's  selection  is  used.
              Setting a name that is not a built-in alternative makes libcurl stay with the default.

              SSL  backend  names  (case-insensitive):  BearSSL,  GnuTLS,  mbedTLS,  OpenSSL,  Rustls, Schannel,
              Secure-Transport, wolfSSL

       HOME   When the netrc feature is used (<u><a href="../man3/CURLOPT_NETRC.3.html">CURLOPT_NETRC</a>(3)</u>), this variable is checked as the primary way  to
              find the "current" home directory in which the .netrc file is likely to exist.

       USERPROFILE
              When  the  netrc feature is used (<u><a href="../man3/CURLOPT_NETRC.3.html">CURLOPT_NETRC</a>(3)</u>), this variable is checked as the secondary way
              to find the "current" home directory (on Windows only) in which  the  .netrc  file  is  likely  to
              exist.

       LOGNAME
              Username to use when invoking the <u>ntlm-wb</u> tool, if <u>NTLMUSER</u> was not set.

       NO_PROXY
              This   has   the  same  functionality  as  the  <u><a href="../man3/CURLOPT_NOPROXY.3.html">CURLOPT_NOPROXY</a>(3)</u>  option:  it  gives  libcurl  a
              comma-separated list of hostname patterns for which libcurl should not use a proxy.

       NTLMUSER
              Username to use when invoking the <u>ntlm-wb</u> tool.

       SSLKEYLOGFILE
              When set and libcurl runs with an SSL backend  that  supports  this  feature,  libcurl  saves  SSL
              secrets  into  the  given  filename.  Using those SSL secrets, other tools (such as Wireshark) can
              decrypt the SSL communication and analyze/view the traffic.

              These secrets and this file might be sensitive. Users are advised to take precautions so that they
              are not stolen or otherwise inadvertently revealed.

       USER   Username to use when invoking the <u>ntlm-wb</u> tool, if <u>NTLMUSER</u> and <u>LOGNAME</u> were not set.
