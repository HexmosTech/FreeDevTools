</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       libcurl - client-side URL transfers

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  is a short overview on how to use libcurl in your C programs. There are specific man pages for each
       function mentioned in here.  See  <u><a href="../man3/libcurl-easy.3.html">libcurl-easy</a>(3)</u>,  <u><a href="../man3/libcurl-multi.3.html">libcurl-multi</a>(3)</u>,  <u><a href="../man3/libcurl-share.3.html">libcurl-share</a>(3)</u>,  <u><a href="../man3/libcurl-url.3.html">libcurl-url</a>(3)</u>,
       <u><a href="../man3/libcurl-ws.3.html">libcurl-ws</a>(3)</u> and <u><a href="../man3/libcurl-tutorial.3.html">libcurl-tutorial</a>(3)</u> for in-depth understanding on how to program with libcurl.

       There are many bindings available that bring libcurl access to your favorite language. Look elsewhere for
       documentation on those.

</pre><h4><b>TRANSFERS</b></h4><pre>
       To  transfer  files, you create an "easy handle" using <u><a href="../man3/curl_easy_init.3.html">curl_easy_init</a>(3)</u> for a single individual transfer
       (in either direction). You then set your desired set of options in that handle with  <u><a href="../man3/curl_easy_setopt.3.html">curl_easy_setopt</a>(3)</u>.
       Options  you set with <u><a href="../man3/curl_easy_setopt.3.html">curl_easy_setopt</a>(3)</u> stick. They are then used for every repeated use of this handle
       until you either change the option, or you reset them all with <u><a href="../man3/curl_easy_reset.3.html">curl_easy_reset</a>(3)</u>.

       To actually transfer data you have the option of using the "easy" interface, or the "multi" interface.

       The easy interface is a synchronous interface with which you call <u><a href="../man3/curl_easy_perform.3.html">curl_easy_perform</a>(3)</u> and let it perform
       the transfer. When it is completed, the function returns and you can continue. More details are found  in
       the <u><a href="../man3/libcurl-easy.3.html">libcurl-easy</a>(3)</u> man page.

       The  multi interface on the other hand is an asynchronous interface, that you call and that performs only
       a little piece of the transfer on each invoke. It is perfect if you want to do things while the  transfer
       is  in  progress,  or  similar. The multi interface allows you to select() on libcurl action, and even to
       easily download multiple files  simultaneously  using  a  single  thread.  See  further  details  in  the
       <u><a href="../man3/libcurl-multi.3.html">libcurl-multi</a>(3)</u> man page.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b> <b>INTERFACES</b></h4><pre>
       There is also a series of other helpful functions and interface families to use, including these:

       curl_version_info()
              gets detailed libcurl (and other used libraries) version info. See <u><a href="../man3/curl_version_info.3.html">curl_version_info</a>(3)</u>

       curl_getdate()
              converts a date string to time_t. See <u><a href="../man3/curl_getdate.3.html">curl_getdate</a>(3)</u>

       curl_easy_getinfo()
              get information about a performed transfer. See <u><a href="../man3/curl_easy_getinfo.3.html">curl_easy_getinfo</a>(3)</u>

       curl_mime_addpart()
              helps building an HTTP form POST. See <u><a href="../man3/curl_mime_addpart.3.html">curl_mime_addpart</a>(3)</u>

       curl_slist_append()
              builds a linked list. See <u><a href="../man3/curl_slist_append.3.html">curl_slist_append</a>(3)</u>

       Sharing data between transfers
              You can have multiple easy handles share certain data, even if they are used in different threads.
              This magic is setup using the share interface, as described in the <u><a href="../man3/libcurl-share.3.html">libcurl-share</a>(3)</u> man page.

       URL Parsing
              URL parsing and manipulations. See <u><a href="../man3/libcurl-url.3.html">libcurl-url</a>(3)</u>

       WebSocket communication
              See <u><a href="../man3/libcurl-ws.3.html">libcurl-ws</a>(3)</u>

</pre><h4><b>LINKING</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>LIBCURL</b></h4><pre>
       On  Unix-like  machines,  there is a tool named curl-config that gets installed with the rest of the curl
       stuff when 'make install' is performed.

       curl-config is added to make it easier for applications to link with  libcurl  and  developers  to  learn
       about libcurl and how to use it.

       Run  'curl-config  --libs'  to  get  the (additional) linker options you need to link with the particular
       version of libcurl you have installed. See the <u><a href="../man1/curl-config.1.html">curl-config</a>(1)</u> man page for further details.

       Unix-like operating system that ship libcurl as part of their distributions  often  do  not  provide  the
       curl-config tool, but simply install the library and headers in the common path for this purpose.

       Many  Linux  and  similar  systems  use  pkg-config to provide build and link options about libraries and
       libcurl supports that as well.

</pre><h4><b>LIBCURL</b> <b>SYMBOL</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       All public functions in the libcurl interface are prefixed with 'curl_' (with a  lowercase  c).  You  can
       find  other  functions  in  the  library  source code, but other prefixes indicate that the functions are
       private and may change without further notice in the next release.

       Only use documented functions and functionality.

</pre><h4><b>PORTABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       libcurl works <b>exactly</b> the same, on any of the platforms it compiles and builds on.

</pre><h4><b>THREADS</b></h4><pre>
       libcurl is thread safe but there are a few exceptions. Refer to <u><a href="../man3/libcurl-thread.3.html">libcurl-thread</a>(3)</u> for more information.

</pre><h4><b>PERSISTENT</b> <b>CONNECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Persistent connections means that libcurl can reuse the same connection for  several  transfers,  if  the
       conditions are right.

       libcurl  always  attempts  to  use  persistent  connections.  Whenever  you  use  <u><a href="../man3/curl_easy_perform.3.html">curl_easy_perform</a>(3)</u> or
       <u><a href="../man3/curl_multi_perform.3.html">curl_multi_perform</a>(3)</u> etc, libcurl attempts to use an existing connection to do the transfer, and if none
       exists it opens a new one that is subject for reuse on a possible following call to  <u><a href="../man3/curl_easy_perform.3.html">curl_easy_perform</a>(3)</u>
       or <u><a href="../man3/curl_multi_perform.3.html">curl_multi_perform</a>(3)</u>.

       To  allow  libcurl  to  take full advantage of persistent connections, you should do as many of your file
       transfers as possible using the same handle.

       If you use the easy interface, and you call <u><a href="../man3/curl_easy_cleanup.3.html">curl_easy_cleanup</a>(3)</u>, all the possibly open connections  held
       by libcurl are closed and forgotten.

       When  you  have  created a multi handle and are using the multi interface, the connection pool is instead
       kept in the multi handle so closing and creating new easy handles to do transfers  do  not  affect  them.
       Instead all added easy handles can take advantage of the single shared pool.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>CONSTANTS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  a variety of constants that libcurl uses, mainly through its internal use of other libraries,
       which are too complicated for the library loader to set up. Therefore, a  program  must  call  a  library
       function after the program is loaded and running to finish setting up the library code. For example, when
       libcurl  is  built  for  SSL  capability  via the GNU TLS library, there is an elaborate tree inside that
       library that describes the SSL protocol.

       <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_init.3.html">curl_global_init</a>(3)</u> is the function that you must call. This may allocate resources (e.g. the memory  for
       the GNU TLS tree mentioned above), so the companion function <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_cleanup.3.html">curl_global_cleanup</a>(3)</u> releases them.

       If libcurl was compiled with support for multiple SSL backends, the function <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_sslset.3.html">curl_global_sslset</a>(3)</u> can be
       called before <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_init.3.html">curl_global_init</a>(3)</u> to select the active SSL backend.

       The  global  constant  functions  are  thread-safe  since  libcurl 7.84.0 if <u><a href="../man3/curl_version_info.3.html">curl_version_info</a>(3)</u> has the
       CURL_VERSION_THREADSAFE feature bit set  (most  platforms).  Read  <u><a href="../man3/libcurl-thread.3.html">libcurl-thread</a>(3)</u>  for  thread  safety
       guidelines.

       If  the  global constant functions are <u>not</u> <u>thread</u> <u>safe</u>, then you must not call them when any other thread
       in the program is running. It is not good enough that no other thread  is  using  libcurl  at  the  time,
       because  these  functions  internally  call similar functions of other libraries, and those functions are
       similarly thread-unsafe. You cannot generally know what these libraries are, or whether other threads are
       using them.

       If the global constant functions are <u>not</u> <u>thread</u> <u>safe</u>, then the basic rule for constructing a program that
       uses libcurl is this: Call <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_init.3.html">curl_global_init</a>(3)</u>, with a <u>CURL_GLOBAL_ALL</u> argument,  immediately  after  the
       program  starts,  while  it  is  still  only  one  thread  and  before  it  uses  libcurl  at  all.  Call
       <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_cleanup.3.html">curl_global_cleanup</a>(3)</u> immediately before the program exits, when the program is again  only  one  thread
       and after its last use of libcurl.

       It  is not actually required that the functions be called at the beginning and end of the program -- that
       is just usually the easiest way to do it.

       You can call both of these multiple times, as long as all calls meet these requirements and the number of
       calls to each is the same.

       The global constant situation merits special consideration when the code you are writing to  use  libcurl
       is not the main program, but rather a modular piece of a program, e.g. another library. As a module, your
       code  does not know about other parts of the program -- it does not know whether they use libcurl or not.
       Its code does not necessarily run at the start and end of the whole program.

       A module like this must have global constant functions of its  own,  just  like  <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_init.3.html">curl_global_init</a>(3)</u>  and
       <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_cleanup.3.html">curl_global_cleanup</a>(3)</u>.  The  module  thus  has control at the beginning and end of the program and has a
       place to call the libcurl functions. If multiple modules in the program use libcurl, they all  separately
       call  the  libcurl  functions,  and  that  is  OK because only the first <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_init.3.html">curl_global_init</a>(3)</u> and the last
       <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_cleanup.3.html">curl_global_cleanup</a>(3)</u> in a program change anything. (libcurl uses a reference count in static memory).

       In a C++ module, it is common to deal with the global constant situation by defining a special class that
       represents the global constant environment of the module. A program always has exactly one object of  the
       class,  in static storage. That way, the program automatically calls the constructor of the object as the
       program starts up and the destructor as it terminates. As the author of this  libcurl-using  module,  you
       can  make  the  constructor  call  <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_init.3.html">curl_global_init</a>(3)</u> and the destructor call <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_cleanup.3.html">curl_global_cleanup</a>(3)</u> and
       satisfy libcurl's requirements without your  user  having  to  think  about  it.   (Caveat:  If  you  are
       initializing libcurl from a Windows DLL you should not initialize it from <u>DllMain</u> or a static initializer
       because Windows holds the loader lock during that time and it could cause a deadlock.)

       <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_init.3.html">curl_global_init</a>(3)</u>  has  an argument that tells what particular parts of the global constant environment
       to set up. In order to successfully use any value except <u>CURL_GLOBAL_ALL</u> (which says to set up the  whole
       thing),  you  must  have  specific  knowledge  of internal workings of libcurl and all other parts of the
       program of which it is part.

       A  special  part  of  the  global  constant  environment  is  the  identity  of  the  memory   allocator.
       <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_init.3.html">curl_global_init</a>(3)</u>  selects the system default memory allocator, but you can use <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_init_mem.3.html">curl_global_init_mem</a>(3)</u>
       to supply one of your own. However, there is no way to use <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_init_mem.3.html">curl_global_init_mem</a>(3)</u> in a  modular  program
       -- all modules in the program that might use libcurl would have to agree on one allocator.

       There  is  a  failsafe  in  libcurl that makes it usable in simple situations without you having to worry
       about the global constant environment at all: <u><a href="../man3/curl_easy_init.3.html">curl_easy_init</a>(3)</u> sets up the environment itself if it  has
       not  been done yet. The resources it acquires to do so get released by the operating system automatically
       when the program exits.

       This failsafe feature exists mainly for backward compatibility because there was a time when  the  global
       functions did not exist. Because it is sufficient only in the simplest of programs, it is not recommended
       for any program to rely on it.
