</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       curl_version_info - returns runtime libcurl version info

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;

       curl_version_info_data *curl_version_info(CURLversion age);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Returns  a  pointer  to  a filled in static struct with information about various features in the running
       version of libcurl. <u>age</u> should be set to the version of this functionality by the  time  you  write  your
       program.  This  way, libcurl always returns a proper struct that your program understands, while programs
       in the future might get a different struct. <b>CURLVERSION_NOW</b> is the most recent one for  the  library  you
       have installed:
         data = curl_version_info(CURLVERSION_NOW);
       Applications  should  use this information to judge if things are possible to do or not, instead of using
       compile-time checks, as dynamic/DLL libraries can be changed independent of applications.

       This function can alter the returned static data as long as <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_init.3.html">curl_global_init</a>(3)</u> has not been  called.  It
       is therefore not thread-safe before libcurl initialization occurs.

       The curl_version_info_data struct looks like this

       typedef struct {
         CURLversion age;          /* see description below */

         const char *version;      /* human readable string */

         const char *hyper_version; /* human readable string. */

       } curl_version_info_data;

       <u>age</u> describes what the age of this struct is. The number depends on how new the libcurl you are using is.
       You are however guaranteed to get a struct that you have a matching struct for in the header, as you tell
       libcurl your "age" with the input argument.

       <u>version</u> is just an ASCII string for the libcurl version.

       <u>version_num</u> is a 24 bit number created like this: &lt;8 bits major number&gt; | &lt;8 bits minor number&gt; | &lt;8 bits
       patch number&gt;. Version 7.9.8 is therefore returned as 0x070908.

       <u>host</u> is an ASCII string showing what host information that this libcurl was built for. As discovered by a
       configure script or set by the build environment.

       <u>features</u>  is  a bit mask representing available features. It can have none, one or more bits set. The use
       of this field is deprecated: use <u>feature_names</u> instead. The feature names  description  below  lists  the
       associated bits.

       <u>feature_names</u>  is  a  pointer  to  an array of string pointers, containing the names of the features that
       libcurl supports. The array is terminated by a NULL entry. See the list of features names below.

       <u>ssl_version</u> is an ASCII string for the TLS library name + version used. If libcurl has  no  SSL  support,
       this  is  NULL.  For  example "Schannel", "Secure Transport" or "OpenSSL/1.1.0g". For MultiSSL builds the
       string contains all SSL backend names and the inactive backend names  are  in  parentheses.  For  example
       "(OpenSSL/3.0.8) Schannel" or "OpenSSL/3.0.8 (Schannel)".

       <u>ssl_version_num</u> is always 0.

       <u>libz_version</u>  is an ASCII string (there is no numerical version). If libcurl has no libz support, this is
       NULL.

       <u>protocols</u> is a pointer to an array of char *  pointers,  containing  the  names  protocols  that  libcurl
       supports  (using  lowercase letters). The protocol names are the same as would be used in URLs. The array
       is terminated by a NULL entry.
