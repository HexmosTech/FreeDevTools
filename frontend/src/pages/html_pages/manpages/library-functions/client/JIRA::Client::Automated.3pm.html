</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       JIRA::Client::Automated is an adapter between any automated system and JIRA's REST API. This module is
       explicitly designed to easily create and close issues within a JIRA instance via automated scripts.

       For example, if you run nightly batch jobs, you can use JIRA::Client::Automated to have those jobs
       automatically create issues in JIRA for you when the script runs into errors. You can attach error log
       files to the issues and then they'll be waiting in someone's open issues list when they arrive at work
       the next day.

       If you want to avoid creating the same issue more than once you can search JIRA for it first, only
       creating it if it doesn't exist. If it does already exist you can add a comment or a new error log to
       that issue.

</pre><h4><b>WORKING</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>JIRA</b> <b>6</b> <b>Atlassian</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>complete</b> <b>REST</b> <b>API</b> <b>for</b> <b>recent</b> <b>(&gt;</b> <b>5.0)</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>JIRA.</b> <b>By</b> <b>virtue</b></h4><pre>
       <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>complete</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>complex</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginner.</b> <b>Reading</b> <b>their</b>
       <b>tutorials</b> <b>is</b> <b>*highly*</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> <b>making</b> <b>hashes</b> <b>to</b> <b>update</b> <b>or</b> <b>transition</b> <b>issues.</b>
       &lt;https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#about&gt;

       This module was designed for the JIRA 5.2.11 REST API, as of March 2013, but it works fine with JIRA 6.0
       as well. Your mileage may vary with future versions.

</pre><h4><b>JIRA</b> <b>ISSUE</b> <b>HASH</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       When you work with an issue in JIRA's REST API, it gives you a JSON file that follows this spec:

       &lt;https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-issue-post&gt;

       JIRA::Client::Automated tries to be nice to you and not make you deal directly with JSON. When you create
       a new issue, you can pass in just the pieces you want and "create_issue" will transform them to JSON for
       you. The same for closing and deleting issues.

       Updating and transitioning issues is more complex.  Each JIRA installation will have different fields
       available for each issue type and transition screen and only you will know what they are. So in those
       cases you'll need to pass in an "update_hash" which will be transformed to the proper JSON by the method.

       An update_hash looks like this:

           { field1 =&gt; value, field2 =&gt; value2, ...}

       For example:

           {
               host_id =&gt; "example.com",
               { resolution =&gt; { name =&gt; "Resolved" } }
           }

       If you do not read JIRA's documentation about their JSON format you will hurt yourself banging your head
       against your desk in frustration the first few times you try to use "update_issue". Please RTFM.

       Note that even though JIRA requires JSON, JIRA::Client::Automated will helpfully translate it to and from
       regular hashes for you. You only pass hashes to JIRA::Client::Automated, not direct JSON.

       I recommend connecting to your JIRA server and calling "get_issue" with a key you know exists and then
       dump the result. That'll get you started.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           my $jira = JIRA::Client::Automated-&gt;new($url, $user, $password);

       Create a new JIRA::Client::Automated object by passing in the following:

       1. URL for the JIRA server, such as "<a href="http://example.atlassian.net/">http://example.atlassian.net/</a>"

       2. Username to use to login to the JIRA server

       3. Password for that user

       All   three  parameters  are  required  if  your  JIRA  instance  uses  basic  authorization,  for  which
       JIRA::Client::Automated must connect to the JIRA instance using <u>some</u> username and password. You may  want
       to set up a special "auto" or "batch" username to use just for use by scripts.

       If  you are using Google Account integration, the username and password to use are the ones you set up at
       the very beginning of the registration process and then never used again because Google logged you in.

       If you have other ways of authorization, like GSSAPI based authorization,  do  not  provide  username  or
       password.

           my $jira = JIRA::Client::Automated-&gt;new($url);

   <b>ua</b>
           my $ua = $jira-&gt;ua();

       Returns  the LWP::UserAgent object used to connect to the JIRA instance.  Typically used to setup proxies
       or make other customizations to the UserAgent.  For example:

           my $ua = $jira-&gt;ua();
           $ua-&gt;env_proxy();
           $ua-&gt;ssl_opts(...);
           $ua-&gt;conn_cache( LWP::ConnCache-&gt;new() );

   <b>trace</b>
           $jira-&gt;<a href="../man1/trace.1.html">trace</a>(1);       # enable
           $jira-&gt;<a href="../man0/trace.0.html">trace</a>(0);       # disable
           $trace = $jira-&gt;trace;

       When tracing is enabled each request and response is logged using carp.

   <b>create</b>
           my $issue = $jira-&gt;create({
               # Jira issue 'fields' hash
               project     =&gt; {
                   key =&gt; $project,
               },
               issuetype   =&gt; {
                   name =&gt; $type,      # "Bug", "Task", "SubTask", etc.
               },
               summary     =&gt; $summary,
               description =&gt; $description,
               parent      =&gt; {        # only required for a subtask
                   key =&gt; $parent_key,
               },
               ...
           });

       Creating a new issue, story, task, subtask, etc.

       Returns a hash containing only the basic information about the new issue, or dies if there is  an  error.
       The hash looks like:

           {
               id =&gt; 24066,
               key =&gt; "TEST-57",
               self =&gt; "https://example.atlassian.net/rest/api/latest/issue/24066"
           }

       See also &lt;https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-issue-post&gt;

   <b>create_issue</b>
           my $issue = $jira-&gt;create_issue($project, $type, $summary, $description, $fields);

       Creating a new issue requires the project key, type ("Bug", "Task", etc.), and a summary and description.

       The  optional  $fields parameter can be used to pass a reference to a hash of extra fields to be set when
       the issue is created, which avoids the need for a separate "update_issue" call. For example:

           $jira-&gt;create_issue($project, $type, $summary, $description, {
               labels =&gt; [ "foo", "bar" ]
           });

       This method calls "create" and return the same hash reference that it does.

   <b>create_subtask</b>
           my $subtask = $jira-&gt;create_subtask($project, $summary, $description, $parent_key);
           # or with optional subtask type
           my $subtask = $jira-&gt;create_subtask($project, $summary, $description, $parent_key, 'sub-task');

       Creating a subtask. If your JIRA instance does not call subtasks "Sub-task" or "sub-task", then you  will
       need to pass in your subtask type.

       This method calls "create" and return the same hash reference that it does.

   <b>update_issue</b>
           $jira-&gt;update_issue($key, $field_update_hash, $update_verb_hash);

       There are two ways to express the updates you want to make to an issue.

       For simple changes you pass $field_update_hash as a reference to a hash of field_name =&gt; new_value pairs.
       For example:

           $jira-&gt;update_issue($key, { summary =&gt; $new_summary });

       That  works  for simple fields, but there are some, like comments, that can't be updated in this way. For
       them you need to use $update_verb_hash.

       The $update_verb_hash parameter allow you to express a  series  of  specific  operations  (verbs)  to  be
       performed on each field. For example:

           $jira-&gt;update_issue($key, undef, {
               labels   =&gt; [ { remove =&gt; "test" }, { add =&gt; "another" } ],
               comments =&gt; [ { remove =&gt; { id =&gt; 10001 } } ]
           });

       The two forms of update can be combined in a single call.

       For more information see:

           L&lt;https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-issue-issueIdOrKey-put&gt;

   <b>get_issue</b>
           my $issue = $jira-&gt;get_issue($key);

       Returns details for any issue, given its key. This call returns a hash containing the information for the
       issue in JIRA's format. See "JIRA ISSUE HASH FORMAT" for details.

   <b>transition_issue</b>
           $jira-&gt;transition_issue($key, $transition);
           $jira-&gt;transition_issue($key, $transition, $update_hash);

       Transitioning  an  issue  is  what  happens when you click the button that says "Resolve Issue" or "Start
       Progress" on it. Doing this from code  is  harder,  but  JIRA::Client::Automated  makes  it  as  easy  as
       possible.

       You  pass  this  method  the  issue  key,  the  name  of the transition or the target status (spacing and
       capitalization matter), and an optional update_hash containing any fields that you want to update.

       <u>Specifying</u> <u>The</u> <u>Transition</u>

       The provided $transition name is first matched against the  available  transitions  for  the  $key  issue
       ('Start  Progress',  'Close Issue').  If there's no match then the names is matched against the available
       target status names ('Open', 'Closed'). You can use whichever is most appropriate.  For example, in  your
       configuration  the  transition  names might vary between different kinds of projects but the status names
       might be the same.  In which case scripts that are meant to work across multiple projects might prefer to
       use the status names.

       The $transition parameter can also be specified as a reference to an array of names.  In  this  case  the
       first one that matches either a transition name or status name is used.  This makes it easier for scripts
       to  work  across  multiple kinds of projects and/or handle the migration of names by allowing current and
       future names to be used, so the later change in JIRA config doesn't cause any breakage.

       <u>Specifying</u> <u>Updates</u>

       If you have required fields on the transition screen  (such  as  "Resolution"  for  the  "Resolve  Issue"
       screen),  you  must  pass  those  fields  in as part of the update_hash or you will get an error from the
       server. See "JIRA ISSUE HASH FORMAT" for the format of the update_hash.

       (Note: it appears that in some obscure cases missing required fields may cause  the  transition  to  fail
       <u>without</u>  causing  an  error  from the server. For example a field that's required but isn't configured to
       appear on the transition screen.)

       The $update_hash is a combination of the $field_update_hash and $update_verb_hash parameters used by  the
       "update_issue" method. Like this:

           $update_hash = {
               fields =&gt; $field_update_hash,
               update =&gt; $update_verb_hash
           };

       You can use it to express both simple field settings and more complex update operations. For example:

           $jira-&gt;transition_issue($key, $transition, {
               fields =&gt; { summary =&gt; $new_summary },
               update =&gt; {
                   labels   =&gt; [ { remove =&gt; "test" }, { add =&gt; "another" } ],
                   comments =&gt; [ { remove =&gt; { id =&gt; 10001 } } ]
               }
           });

   <b>close_issue</b>
           $jira-&gt;close_issue($key);
           $jira-&gt;close_issue($key, $resolve);
           $jira-&gt;close_issue($key, $resolve, $comment);
           $jira-&gt;close_issue($key, $resolve, $comment, $update_hash);
           $jira-&gt;close_issue($key, $resolve, $comment, $update_hash, $operation);

       Pass  in the resolution reason and an optional comment to close an issue. Using this method requires that
       the issue is is a status where it can use the "Close  Issue"  transition  (or  other  one,  specified  by
       $operation).  If not, you will get an error from the server.

       Resolution  ("Fixed", "Won't Fix", etc.) is only required if the issue hasn't already been resolved in an
       earlier transition. If you try to resolve an issue twice, you will get an error.

       If you do not supply a comment, the default value is "Issue closed by script".

       The $update_hash can be used to set or edit the values of other fields.

       The $operation parameter can be used to specify the closing transition type. This can be useful when your
       JIRA configuration uses nonstandard or localized transition and status names, e.g.

               use utf8;
               $jira-&gt;close_issue($key, $resolve, $comment, $update_hash, "Done");

       See "transition_issue" for more details.

       This method is a wrapper for "transition_issue".

   <b>delete_issue</b>
           $jira-&gt;delete_issue($key);

       Deleting issues is for testing your JIRA code. In  real  situations  you  almost  always  want  to  close
       unwanted issues with an "Oops!" resolution instead.

   <b>create_comment</b>
           $jira-&gt;create_comment($key, $text);

       You  may  use  any  valid JIRA markup in comment text. (This is handy for tables of values explaining why
       something in the database is wrong.) Note that comments are all created by the user you  used  to  create
       your JIRA::Client::Automated object, so you'll see that name often.

   <b>search_issues</b>
           my @search_results = $jira-&gt;search_issues($jql, 1, 100, $fields);

       You've  used JQL before, when you did an "Advanced Search" in the JIRA web interface. That's the only way
       to search via the REST API.

       This is a paged method. Pass in the starting result number and number of results per  page  and  it  will
       return issues a page at a time. If you know you want all of the results, you can use "all_search_results"
       instead.

       Optional parameter $fields is the arrayref containing the list of fields to be returned.

       This method returns a hashref containing up to five values:

       1. total =&gt; total number of results

       2. start =&gt; result number for the first result

       3. max =&gt; maximum number of results per page

       4. issues =&gt; an arrayref containing the actual found issues

       5. errors =&gt; an arrayref containing error messages

       For example, to page through all results $max at a time:

           my (@all_results, @issues);
           do {
               $results = $self-&gt;search_issues($jql, $start, $max);
               if ($results-&gt;{errors}) {
                   die join "\n", @{$results-&gt;{errors}};
               }
               @issues = @{$results-&gt;{issues}};
               push @all_results, @issues;
               $start += $max;
           } until (scalar(@issues) &lt; $max);

       (Or just use "all_search_results" instead.)

   <b>all_search_results</b>
           my @issues = $jira-&gt;all_search_results($jql, 1000);

       Like  "search_issues",  but  returns  all the results as an array of issues.  You can specify the maximum
       number   to   return,   but   no   matter   what,   it   can't   return   more   than   the   value    of
       jira.search.views.default.max for your JIRA installation.

   <b>get_issue_comments</b>
           $jira-&gt;get_issue_comments($key);

       Returns arryref of all comments to the given issue.

   <b>attach_file_to_issue</b>
           $jira-&gt;attach_file_to_issue($key, $filename);

       This  method  does  not  let  you  attach  a  comment to the issue at the same time.  You'll need to call
       "create_comment" for that.

       Watch out for file permissions! If the user running the script does not have permission to read the  file
       it is trying to upload, you'll get weird errors.

   <b>make_browse_url</b>
           my $url = $jira-&gt;make_browse_url($key);

       A  helper  method  to  return  the  "".../browse/$key""  url  for  the  issue.  It's handy to make emails
       containing lists of bugs easier to create.

       This just appends the key to the URL for the JIRA server so that you can click on it and go  directly  to
       that issue.

   <b>get_link_types</b>
           my $all_link_types = $jira-&gt;get_link_types();

       Get the arrayref of all possible link types.

   <b>link_issues</b>
           $jira-&gt;link_issues($from, $to, $type);

       Establish  a  link  of  the  type named $type from issue key $from to issue key $to .  Returns nothing on
       success; structure containing error messages otherwise.

   <b>add_issue_labels</b>
           $jira-&gt;add_issue_labels($issue_key, @labels);

</pre><h4><b>FAQ</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>no</b> <b>object</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>JIRA</b> <b>issue?</b>
       Because it seemed silly. You <u>could</u> write such an object and give it methods to transition  itself,  close
       itself,  etc.,  but  when  you are working with JIRA from batch scripts, you're never really working with
       just one issue at a time.  And when you have a hundred of them, it's easier to  not  objectify  them  and
       just use JIRA::Client::Automated as a mediator. That said, if this is important to you, I wouldn't say no
       to a patch offering this option.
