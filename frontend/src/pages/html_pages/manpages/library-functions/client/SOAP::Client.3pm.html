</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SOAP::Client - exists purely as a superclass for client classes declared by the various SOAP::Lite
       transport modules.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The SOAP::Client class exists purely as a superclass for client classes declared by the various
       SOAP::Lite transport modules. The methods it provides are all simple accessors; they return the current
       value when called with no arguments or set the attribute value and return the object reference when
       called with an argument. These attributes include:

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       code, message, status
           Stores  the response code, message, and status from the most-recent send attempt. For some protocols,
           such as FTP, the same value is used for all three because of the lack of  finer-grained  detail  (the
           default  is  to  ensure  that  all three attributes contain data, even if redundant). Other protocols
           (such as HTTP) have distinct values in each.

       endpoint
           Identifies the current endpoint to which messages are being sent. This should match the value of  the
           transport  method from the SOAP::Transport class, but setting this doesn't propagate to the transport
           object. It is better to use the transport object (or the shortcut via the SOAP::Lite  object  itself)
           when setting this.

       is_success
           The success or failure of the most-recent transmission is noted here as a boolean value.

       options
           The  options  attribute  keeps  a  hash-table  reference  of additional  options and their values. At
           present, only one option is used by any of the transport modules:

           compress_threshold
               The value of this option should be a numerical value. If set, and if the  Compress::Zlib  library
               is  available, messages whose size in bytes exceeds this value will be compressed before sending.
               Both ends of the conversation must have it enabled.

           Other options may be defined using this mechanism. Note that setting the options using this  accessor
           requires  a  full  hash reference be passed. To set just one or a few values, consider retrieving the
           current reference value and using it to set the key(s).
