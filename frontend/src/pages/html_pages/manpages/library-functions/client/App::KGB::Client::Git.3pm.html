</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::KGB::Client::Git - Git support for KGB client

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       my $c = App::KGB::Client::Git-&gt;new({
           ...
           git_dir =&gt; '/some/where',   # defaults to $ENV{GIT_DIR}
           old_rev     =&gt; 'a7c42f58',
           new_rev     =&gt; '8b37ed8a', });

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       App::KGB::Client::Git provides KGB client with knowledge about Git repositories. Its  method returns a
       series of App::KGB::Commit objects, each corresponding to the next commit of the received series.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>App::KGB::Client::Git-&gt;new(</b> <b>{</b> <b>parameters...</b> <b>}</b> <b>)</b>
       Input data can be given in any of the following ways:

       as parameters to the constructor
               # a single commit
               my $c = App::KGB::Client::Git-&gt;new({
                   old_rev =&gt; '9ae45bc',
                   new_rev =&gt; 'a04d3ef',
                   refname =&gt; 'master',
               });

       as a list of revisions/refnames
               # several commits
               my $c = App::KGB::Client::Git-&gt;new({
                   changesets  =&gt; [
                       [ '4b3d756', '62a7c8f', 'master' ],
                       [ '7a2fedc', '0d68c3a', 'my'     ],
                       ...
                   ],
               });

           All the other ways to supply the changes data is converted internally to this one.

       in a file whose name is in the <b>reflog</b> parameter
           A  file  name  of "-" means standard input, which is the normal way for Git post-receive hooks to get
           the data.

           The file must contain three words separated by spaces on each line. The first one is taken to be  the
           old revision, the second is the new revision and the third is the refname.

       on the command line
           Useful  when  testing  the KGB client from the command line. If neither <b>old_rev</b>, <b>new_rev</b>, <b>refname</b> nor
           <b>changesets</b> is given to the constructor, and if @ARGV has exactly three elements, they are taken to be
           old revision, new revision and refname respectively. Only  one  commit  can  be  represented  on  the
           command line.

       In all of the above methods, the location of the <u>.git</u> directory can be given in the <b>git_dir</b> parameter, or
       it will be taken from the environment variable <b>GIT_DIR</b>.

   <b>git-config</b> <b>parameters</b>
       The  following  parameters  can be set in the "[kgb]" section of <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1). If present, they override
       the settings in the configuration file and these given on the command line.

       project-id
           The project ID.

           See "project-id" in App::KGB::Client for details.

       web-link
           See "web-link" in App::KGB::Client for details.

       squash-threshold <u>number</u>
           Unique to Git KGB client. Sets a threshold of the notifications produced for a given  branch  update.
           If  there  are  more  commits  in the update, instead of producing huge amounts of notifications, the
           commits are "squashed" into one notification per branch with a summary of the changes.

           The default value is 20.

       squash-message-template <u>string</u>
           A template for construction of squashed messages.  See  "message-template"  in  App::KGB::Client  for
           details.

           The default is "${{module} }${{branch} }${{commit} }${{author-name} }${{log}}".

       tag-squash-threshold <u>number</u>
           Unique  to Git KGB client. Sets a threshold of the notifications produced for tag creations. If there
           are more tags created in the push, instead of producing huge amounts of notifications, the  tags  are
           "squashed" into one notification summarizing the information.

           The default value is 5.

       tag-squash-message-template <u>string</u>
           A template for construction of squashed tags messages. See "message-template" in App::KGB::Client for
           details.

           The default is "${{module} }${{author-name} }${{log}}".

       enable-branch-ff-notification <u>bool</u>
           Enables  notifications  about  branch updates whose commits have already been reported. Normally this
           causes a notification like "fast forward" to appear.  If you don't like this, set it to false.

           The default is "true".

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       describe_commit
           Returns an instance of App::KGB::Change class for each commit. Returns <b>undef</b> when  all  commits  were
           processed.

       format_git_stat <u>text</u>
           returns a colored version of <u>text</u>, which is expected to be the result of "git diff --shortstat".
