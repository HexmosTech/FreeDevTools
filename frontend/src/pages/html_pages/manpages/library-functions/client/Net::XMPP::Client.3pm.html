</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::XMPP::Client - XMPP Client Module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Net::XMPP::Client is a module that provides a developer easy access to the Extensible Messaging and
       Presence Protocol (XMPP).

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Client.pm uses Protocol.pm to provide enough high level APIs and automation of the low level APIs that
       writing an XMPP Client in Perl is trivial.  For those that wish to work with the low level you can do
       that too, but those functions are covered in the documentation for each module.

       Net::XMPP::Client provides functions to connect to an XMPP server, login, send and receive messages, set
       personal information, create a new user account, manage the roster, and disconnect.  You can use all or
       none of the functions, there is no requirement.

       For more information on how the details for how Net::XMPP is written please see the help for Net::XMPP
       itself.

       For a full list of high level functions available please see Net::XMPP::Protocol.

   <b>Basic</b> <b>Functions</b>
           use Net::XMPP;

           $Con = Net::XMPP::Client-&gt;new();

           $Con-&gt;SetCallbacks(...);

           $Con-&gt;Execute(hostname=&gt;"jabber.org",
                         username=&gt;"bob",
                         password=&gt;"XXXX",
                         resource=&gt;"Work"
                        );

       For the list of available functions see Net::XMPP::Protocol.

         $Con-&gt;Disconnect();

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>Basic</b> <b>Functions</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           new(debuglevel=&gt;0|1|2,
               debugfile=&gt;string,
               debugtime=&gt;0|1)

       creates the Client object.  debugfile should be set to the path for the debug log to be written.  If set
       to "stdout" then the debug will go there.  debuglevel controls the amount of debug.  For more information
       about the valid setting for debuglevel, debugfile, and debugtime see Net::XMPP::Debug.

   <b>Connect</b>
           Connect(hostname=&gt;string,
                   port=&gt;integer,
                   timeout=&gt;int,
                   connectiontype=&gt;string,
                   tls=&gt;0|1,
                   srv=&gt;0|1,
                   componentname=&gt;string)

       opens a connection to the server listed in the hostname (default localhost), on the port (default 5222)
       listed, using the connectiontype listed (default tcpip).  The two connection types available are:

         tcpip  standard TCP socket
         http   TCP socket, but with the
                headers needed to talk
                through a web proxy

       If you specify tls, then it TLS will be used if it is available as a feature.

       If srv is specified AND Net::DNS is installed and can be loaded, then an SRV query is sent to
       srv.hostname and the results processed to replace the hostname and port.  If the lookup fails, or
       Net::DNS cannot be loaded, then hostname and port are left alone as the defaults.

       Alternatively, you may manually specify componentname as the domain portion of the jid and leave hostname
       set to the actual hostname of the XMPP server.

   <b>Execute</b>
           Execute(hostname=&gt;string,
                   port=&gt;int,
                   tls=&gt;0|1,
                   username=&gt;string,
                   password=&gt;string,
                   resource=&gt;string,
                   register=&gt;0|1,
                   connectiontype=&gt;string,
                   connecttimeout=&gt;string,
                   connectattempts=&gt;int,
                   connectsleep=&gt;int,
                   processtimeout=&gt;int)

       Generic inner loop to handle connecting to the server, calling Process, and reconnecting if the
       connection is lost.  There are five callbacks available that are called at various places:

        onconnect - when the client has
                    made a connection.

        onauth - when the connection is
                 made and user has been
                 authed.  Essentially,
                 this is when you can
               start doing things
               as a Client.  Like
               send presence, get your
               roster, etc...

         onprocess - this is the most
                     inner loop and so
                     gets called the most.
                     Be very very careful
                     what you put here
                     since it can
                     *DRASTICALLY* affect
                     performance.

         ondisconnect - when the client
                        disconnects from
                        the server.

         onexit - when the function gives
                  up trying to connect and
                  exits.

       The arguments are passed straight on to the Connect function, except for connectattempts and
       connectsleep.  connectattempts is the number of times that the Component should try to connect before
       giving up.  -1 means try forever.  The default is -1. connectsleep is the number of seconds to sleep
       between each connection attempt.

       If you specify register=&gt;1, then the Client will attempt to register the sepecified account for you, if
       it does not exist.

   <b>Process</b>
           Process(integer)

       takes the timeout period as an argument.  If no timeout is listed then the function blocks until a packet
       is received.  Otherwise it waits that number of seconds and then exits so your program can continue doing
       useful things.  NOTE: This is important for GUIs.  You need to leave time to process GUI commands even if
       you are waiting for packets.  The following are the possible return values, and what they mean:

           1   - Status ok, data received.
           0   - Status ok, no data received.
         undef - Status not ok, stop processing.

       IMPORTANT: You need to check the output of every Process.  If you get an undef then the connection died
       and you should behave accordingly.

   <b>Disconnect</b>
           Disconnect()

       closes the connection to the server.

   <b>Connected</b>
           Connected()

       returns 1 if the Transport is connected to the server, and 0 if not.
