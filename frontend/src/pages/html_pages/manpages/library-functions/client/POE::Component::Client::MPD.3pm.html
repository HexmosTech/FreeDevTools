</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Component::Client::MPD - full-blown poe-aware mpd client library

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.001

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use POE qw{ Component::Client::MPD };
           POE::Component::Client::MPD-&gt;spawn( {
               host           =&gt; 'localhost',
               port           =&gt; 6600,
               password       =&gt; 's3kr3t',  # mpd password
               alias          =&gt; 'mpd',     # poe alias
               status_msgs_to =&gt; 'myapp',   # session to send status info to
           } );

           # ... later on ...
           $_[KERNEL]-&gt;post( mpd =&gt; 'next' );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       POCOCM gives a clear message-passing interface (sitting on top of POE) for talking to and controlling MPD
       (Music Player Daemon) servers. A connection to the MPD server is established as soon as a new POCOCM
       object is created.

       Commands are then sent to the server as messages are passed.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>host</b>
       The hostname where MPD is running. Defaults to environment var "MPD_HOST", then to 'localhost'. Note that
       "MPD_HOST" can be of the form "password@host:port" (each of "password@" or ":port" can be omitted).

   <b>port</b>
       The port that MPD server listens to. Defaults to environment var "MPD_PORT", then to parsed "MPD_HOST"
       (cf above), then to 6600.

   <b>password</b>
       The password to access special MPD functions. Defaults to environment var "MPD_PASSWORD", then to parsed
       "MPD_HOST" (cf above), then to empty string.

   <b>alias</b>
       A string to alias the newly created POE session. Defaults to "mpd".

   <b>status_msgs_to</b>
       A session (name or id) to whom to send connection status to. Optional, although recommended. No default.
       When this is done, pococm will send *additional* events to the session, such as: "mpd_connected" when
       pococm is connected, "mpd_disconnected" when pococm is disconnected, etc. You thus need to register some
       handlers for those events.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>my</b> <b>$id</b> <b>=</b> <b>POE::Component::Client::MPD-&gt;spawn(</b> <b>\%params</b> <b>);</b>
       This method will create a POE session responsible for communicating with mpd. It will return the poe id
       of the session newly created. You can tune it by passing some arguments as a hash reference. See the
       attributes for allowed values.

</pre><h4><b>PUBLIC</b> <b>EVENTS</b> <b>ACCEPTED</b></h4><pre>
   <b>MPD-related</b> <b>events</b>
       The goal of a POCOCM session is to drive a remote MPD server. This can be achieved by a lot of events.
       Due to their sheer number, they have been regrouped logically in modules.

       However, note that to use those events, you need to send them to the POCOCM session that you created with
       spawn() (see above). Indeed, the logical split is only internal: you are to use the same peer.

       For a list of public events that update and/or query MPD, see embedded pod in:

       •   POE::Component::Client::MPD::Commands for general commands

       •   POE::Component::Client::MPD::Playlist for playlist-related commands. Those events begin with "pl.".

       •   POE::Component::Client::MPD::Collection  for  collection-  related  commands. Those events begin with
           "coll.".

   <b>disconnect(</b> <b>)</b>
       Request the POCOCM to be shutdown. Leave mpd running. Generally sent when one wants to exit her program.

</pre><h4><b>EVENTS</b> <b>FIRED</b></h4><pre>
       A POCOCM session will fire events, either to answer an incoming event, or to inform  about  some  changes
       regarding the remote MPD server.

   <b>Answer</b> <b>events</b>
       For each incoming event received by the POCOCM session, it will fire back one of the following answers:

       •   mpd_result( $msg, $answer )

           Indicates a success. $msg is a POE::Component::Client::MPD::Message object with the original request,
           to  identify  the issued command (see POE::Component::Client::MPD::Message pod for more information).
           Its status() attribute is true, further confirming success.

           $answer is what has been answered by the MPD server. Depending on the command, it can be either:

           •   "undef": commands "play", etc.

           •   an Audio::MPD::Common::Stats object: command "stats"

           •   an Audio::MPD::Common::Status object: command "status"

           •   an Audio::MPD::Common::Item object: commands "song", etc.

           •   an array reference: commands "coll.files", etc.

           •   etc.

           Refer to the documentation of each event to know what type of answer you can expect.

       •   mpd_error( $msg, $errstr )

           Indicates a failure. $msg is a POE::Component::Client::MPD::Message object with the original request,
           to identify the issued command (see POE::Component::Client::MPD::Message pod for  more  information).
           Its status() attribute is false, further confirming failure.

           $errstr is what the error message as returned been answered by the MPD server.

   <b>Auto-generated</b> <b>events</b>
       If you supplied the "status_msgs_to" attribute, the following events are fired to this peer by pococm:

       •   mpd_connect_error( $reason )

           Called  when  pococm-conn  could  not  connect to a mpd server. It can be either retriable, or fatal.
           Check $reason for more information.

       •   mpd_connected( )

           Called when pococm-conn made sure we're talking to a mpd server.

       •   mpd_disconnected( )

           Called when pococm-conn has been disconnected from mpd server.
