       HTTP::Response - HTTP style response message

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 7.00

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Response objects are returned by the <b>request()</b> method of the "LWP::UserAgent":

           # ...
           $response = $ua-&gt;request($request);
           if ($response-&gt;is_success) {
               print $response-&gt;decoded_content;
           }
           else {
               print STDERR $response-&gt;status_line, "\n";
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "HTTP::Response" class encapsulates HTTP style responses.  A response consists of a response line,
       some headers, and a content body. Note that the LWP library uses HTTP style responses even for non-HTTP
       protocol schemes.  Instances of this class are usually created and returned by the <b>request()</b> method of an
       "LWP::UserAgent" object.

       "HTTP::Response" is a subclass of "HTTP::Message" and therefore inherits its methods.  The following
       additional methods are available:

       $r = HTTP::Response-&gt;new( $code )
       $r = HTTP::Response-&gt;new( $code, $msg )
       $r = HTTP::Response-&gt;new( $code, $msg, $header )
       $r = HTTP::Response-&gt;new( $code, $msg, $header, $content )
           Constructs  a new "HTTP::Response" object describing a response with response code $code and optional
           message $msg.  The optional $header argument should be a reference to an "HTTP::Headers" object or  a
           plain  array  reference  of  key/value  pairs.   The optional $content argument should be a string of
           bytes.  The meanings of these arguments are described below.

       $r = HTTP::Response-&gt;parse( $str )
           This constructs a new response object by parsing the given string.

       $r-&gt;code
       $r-&gt;code( $code )
           This is used to get/set the code attribute.  The code is a 3 digit number  that  encode  the  overall
           outcome of an HTTP response.  The "HTTP::Status" module provide constants that provide mnemonic names
           for the code attribute.

       $r-&gt;message
       $r-&gt;message( $message )
           This  is  used  to  get/set the message attribute.  The message is a short human readable single line
           string that explains the response code.

       $r-&gt;header( $field )
       $r-&gt;header( $field =&gt; $value )
           This is used to get/set header values and it is inherited from "HTTP::Headers"  via  "HTTP::Message".
           See HTTP::Headers for details and other similar methods that can be used to access the headers.

       $r-&gt;content
       $r-&gt;content( $bytes )
           This is used to get/set the raw content and it is inherited from the "HTTP::Message" base class.  See
           HTTP::Message for details and other methods that can be used to access the content.

       $r-&gt;decoded_content( %options )
           This  will  return  the  content  after  any  "Content-Encoding" and charsets have been decoded.  See
           HTTP::Message for details.

       $r-&gt;request
       $r-&gt;request( $request )
           This is used to get/set the request attribute.  The request attribute is a reference to  the  request
           that  caused  this  response.   It  does not have to be the same request passed to the $ua-&gt;<b>request()</b>
           method, because there might have been redirects and authorization retries in between.

       $r-&gt;previous
       $r-&gt;previous( $response )
           This is used to get/set the previous attribute.  The previous attribute  is  used  to  link  together
           chains  of responses.  You get chains of responses if the first response is redirect or unauthorized.
           The value is "undef" if this is the first response in a chain.

           Note that the method $r-&gt;redirects is provided as a more convenient way to access the response chain.

       $r-&gt;status_line
           Returns the string "&lt;code&gt; &lt;message&gt;".  If the message attribute is not set then the official name of
           &lt;code&gt; (see HTTP::Status) is substituted.

       $r-&gt;base
           Returns the base URI for this response.  The return value will be a reference to a URI object.

           The base URI is obtained from one the following sources (in priority order):

           1.  Embedded in the document content, for instance &lt;BASE HREF="..."&gt; in HTML documents.

           2.  A "Content-Base:" header in the response.

               For backwards compatibility with older HTTP implementations we will also  look  for  the  "Base:"
               header.

           3.  The  URI  used  to  request  this response. This might not be the original URI that was passed to
               $ua-&gt;<b>request()</b> method, because we might have received some redirect responses first.

           If none of these sources provide an absolute URI, undef is returned.

           <b>Note</b>: previous versions of HTTP::Response would also consider a "Content-Location:"  header,  as  RFC
           2616  &lt;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616&gt;  said  it  should  be.   But  this  was  never  widely
           implemented by browsers, and now RFC 7231 &lt;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231&gt; says it should  no
           longer be considered.

           When  the  LWP  protocol modules produce the HTTP::Response object, then any base URI embedded in the
           document (step 1) will already have initialized the  "Content-Base:"  header.  (See  "parse_head"  in
           LWP::UserAgent).   This  means  that  this  method only performs the last 2 steps (the content is not
           always available either).

       $r-&gt;filename
           Returns a filename for this response.  Note that doing sanity checks on the  returned  filename  (eg.
           removing  characters  that  cannot be used on the target filesystem where the filename would be used,
           and laundering it for security purposes) are the caller's responsibility; the only related thing done
           by this method is that it makes a simple attempt to return a plain filename with  no  preceding  path
           segments.

           The filename is obtained from one the following sources (in priority order):

           1.  A  "Content-Disposition:"  header in the response.  Proper decoding of RFC 2047 encoded filenames
               requires the "MIME::QuotedPrint" (for "Q"  encoding),  "MIME::Base64"  (for  "B"  encoding),  and
               "Encode" modules.

           2.  A "Content-Location:" header in the response.

           3.  The  URI  used  to  request  this response. This might not be the original URI that was passed to
               $ua-&gt;<b>request()</b> method, because we might have received some redirect responses first.

           If a filename cannot be derived from any of these sources, undef is returned.

       $r-&gt;as_string
       $r-&gt;as_string( $eol )
           Returns a textual representation of the response.

       $r-&gt;is_info
       $r-&gt;is_success
       $r-&gt;is_redirect
       $r-&gt;is_error
       $r-&gt;is_client_error
       $r-&gt;is_server_error
           These methods indicate if the response was informational, successful, a  redirection,  or  an  error.
           See HTTP::Status for the meaning of these.

       $r-&gt;error_as_HTML
           Returns  a  string  containing  a complete HTML document indicating what error occurred.  This method
           should only be called when $r-&gt;is_error is TRUE.

       $r-&gt;redirects
           Returns the list of redirect responses that lead up to this response by  following  the  $r-&gt;previous
           chain.  The list order is oldest first.

           In scalar context return the number of redirect responses leading up to this one.

       $r-&gt;current_age
           Calculates  the  "current age" of the response as specified by RFC 2616 section 13.2.3.  The age of a
           response is the time since it was sent by  the  origin  server.   The  returned  value  is  a  number
           representing the age in seconds.

       $r-&gt;freshness_lifetime( %opt )
           Calculates  the  "freshness  lifetime"  of the response as specified by RFC 2616 section 13.2.4.  The
           "freshness lifetime" is the length of time between the generation of a response  and  its  expiration
           time.  The returned value is the number of seconds until expiry.

           If  the  response  does not contain an "Expires" or a "Cache-Control" header, then this function will
           apply some simple heuristic based on the "Last-Modified" header to  determine  a  suitable  lifetime.
           The following options might be passed to control the heuristics:

           heuristic_expiry =&gt; $bool
               If  passed  as  a  FALSE  value, don't apply heuristics and just return "undef" when "Expires" or
               "Cache-Control" is lacking.

           h_lastmod_fraction =&gt; $num
               This number represent the fraction of the difference since the "Last-Modified" timestamp to  make
               the expiry time.  The default is 0.10, the suggested typical setting of 10% in RFC 2616.

           h_min =&gt; $sec
               This is the lower limit of the heuristic expiry age to use.  The default is 60 (1 minute).

           h_max =&gt; $sec
               This is the upper limit of the heuristic expiry age to use.  The default is 86400 (24 hours).

           h_default =&gt; $sec
               This is the expiry age to use when nothing else applies.  The default is 3600 (1 hour) or "h_min"
               if greater.

       $r-&gt;is_fresh( %opt )
           Returns TRUE if the response is fresh, based on the values of <b>freshness_lifetime()</b> and <b>current_age()</b>.
           If  the  response  is  no  longer  fresh,  then it has to be re-fetched or re-validated by the origin
           server.

           Options might be passed to control expiry heuristics, see the description of <b>freshness_lifetime()</b>.

       $r-&gt;fresh_until( %opt )
           Returns the time (seconds since epoch) when this entity is no longer fresh.

           Options might be passed to control expiry heuristics, see the description of <b>freshness_lifetime()</b>.
