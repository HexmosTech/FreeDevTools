</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       "Apache2::Response" provides the Apache request object utilities API for dealing with HTTP response
       generation process.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       "Apache2::Response" provides the following functions and/or methods:

   <b>"custom_response"</b>
       Install a custom response handler for a given status

         $r-&gt;custom_response($status, $string);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
           The current request

       arg1: $status ( "Apache2::Const constant" )
           The status for which the custom response should be used (e.g. "Apache2::Const::AUTH_REQUIRED")

       arg2: $string (string)
           The  custom  response  to  use.   This  can  be  a static string, or a URL, full or just the uri path
           (<u>/foo/bar.txt</u>).

       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

       custom_response() doesn't alter the response code, but is used to replace the standard response body. For
       example, here is how to change the response body for the access handler failure:

         package MyApache2::MyShop;
         use Apache2::Response ();
         use Apache2::Const -compile =&gt; qw(FORBIDDEN OK);
         sub access {
             my $r = shift;

             if (MyApache2::MyShop::tired_squirrels()) {
                 $r-&gt;custom_response(Apache2::Const::FORBIDDEN,
                     "It's siesta time, please try later");
                 return Apache2::Const::FORBIDDEN;
             }

             return Apache2::Const::OK;
         }
         ...

         # httpd.conf
         PerlModule MyApache2::MyShop
         &lt;Location /TestAPI__custom_response&gt;
             AuthName dummy
             AuthType none
             PerlAccessHandler   MyApache2::MyShop::access
             PerlResponseHandler MyApache2::MyShop::response
         &lt;/Location&gt;

       When squirrels can't run any more, the handler will return 403, with the custom message:

         It's siesta time, please try later

   <b>"make_etag"</b>
       Construct an entity tag from the resource information.  If it's a real file, build in some  of  the  file
       characteristics.

         $etag = $r-&gt;make_etag($force_weak);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
           The current request

       arg1: $force_weak (number)
           Force the entity tag to be weak - it could be modified again in as short an interval.

       ret: $etag (string)
           The entity tag

       since: 2.0.00

   <b>"meets_conditions"</b>
       Implements  condition  "GET" rules for HTTP/1.1 specification.  This function inspects the client headers
       and determines if the response fulfills the specified requirements.

         $status = $r-&gt;meets_conditions();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
           The current request

       ret: $status ( "Apache2::Const status constant" )
           "Apache2::Const::OK" if the response fulfills the condition GET rules. Otherwise  some  other  status
           code (which should be returned to Apache).

       since: 2.0.00

       Refer to the Generating Correct HTTP Headers document for an indepth discussion of this method.

   <b>"rationalize_mtime"</b>
       Return the latest rational time from a request/mtime pair.

         $mtime_rat = $r-&gt;rationalize_mtime($mtime);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
           The current request

       arg1: $mtime ( time in seconds )
           The last modified time

       ret: $mtime_rat ( time in seconds )
           the  latest rational time from a request/mtime pair.  Mtime is returned unless it's in the future, in
           which case we return the current time.

       since: 2.0.00

   <b>"send_cgi_header"</b>
       Parse the header

         $r-&gt;send_cgi_header($buffer);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       arg1: $buffer (string)
           headers and optionally a response body

       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

       This method is really for back-compatibility with mod_perl 1.0. It's very  inefficient  to  send  headers
       this way, because of the parsing overhead.

       If there is a response body following the headers it'll be handled too (as if it was sent via print()).

       Notice  that  if  only  HTTP  headers  are included they won't be sent until some body is sent (again the
       "send" part is retained from the mod_perl 1.0 method).

   <b>"set_content_length"</b>
       Set the content length for this request.

         $r-&gt;set_content_length($length);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
           The current request

       arg1: $length (integer)
           The new content length

       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

   <b>"set_etag"</b>
       Set the E-tag outgoing header

         $r-&gt;set_etag();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

   <b>"set_keepalive"</b>
       Set the keepalive status for this request

         $ret = $r-&gt;set_keepalive();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
           The current request

       ret: $ret ( boolean )
           true if keepalive can be set, false otherwise

       since: 2.0.00

       It's called by ap_http_header_filter(). For the complete complicated logic implemented by this method see
       <u>httpd-2.0/server/http_protocol.c</u>.

   <b>"set_last_modified"</b>
       sets the "Last-Modified" response header field to the value of the mtime field in the  request  structure
       -- rationalized to keep it from being in the future.

         $r-&gt;set_last_modified($mtime);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $mtime ( time in seconds )
           if the $mtime argument is passed, $r-&gt;update_mtime will be first run with that argument.

       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

   <b>"update_mtime"</b>
       Set the "$r-&gt;mtime" field to the specified value if it's later than what's already there.

         $r-&gt;update_mtime($mtime);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
           The current request

       arg1: $mtime ( time in seconds )
       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

       See also: $r-&gt;set_last_modified.

</pre><h4><b>Unsupported</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       "Apache2::Response"  also  provides  auto-generated  Perl  interface for a few other methods which aren't
       tested at the moment and therefore their API is a subject to change.  These  methods  will  be  finalized
       later  as  a  need  arises.  If  you  want to rely on any of the following methods please contact the the
       mod_perl development mailing list so we can help each other take the steps necessary to shift the  method
       to an officially supported API.

   <b>"send_error_response"</b>
       Send  an "error" response back to client. It is used for any response that can be generated by the server
       from the request record.  This includes all 204 (no content), 3xx (redirect), 4xx (client error), and 5xx
       (server error) messages that have not been redirected to another handler via the ErrorDocument feature.

         $r-&gt;send_error_response($recursive_error);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
           The current request

       arg1: $recursive_error ( boolean )
           the error status in case we get an error in the process of trying to deal with an "ErrorDocument"  to
           handle  some  other  error.   In that case, we print the default report for the first thing that went
           wrong, and more briefly report on the problem with the "ErrorDocument".

       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

       META: it's really an internal Apache method, I'm not quite sure how can it be used externally.

   <b>"send_mmap"</b>
       META: Autogenerated - needs to be reviewed/completed

       Send an MMAP'ed file to the client

         $ret = $r-&gt;send_mmap($mm, $offset, $length);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
           The current request

       arg1: $mm ("APR::Mmap")
           The MMAP'ed file to send

       arg2: $offset (number)
           The offset into the MMAP to start sending

       arg3: $length (integer)
           The amount of data to send

       ret: $ret (integer)
           The number of bytes sent

       since: 2.0.00

       META: requires a working APR::Mmap, which is not supported at the moment.
