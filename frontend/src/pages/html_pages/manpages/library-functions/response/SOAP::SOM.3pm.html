</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SOAP::SOM - provides access to the values contained in SOAP Response

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Objects from the SOAP::SOM class aren't generally instantiated directly by an application. Rather, they
       are handed back by the deserialization of a message. In other words, developers will almost never do
       this:

           $som = SOAP::SOM-&gt;new;

       SOAP::SOM objects are returned by a SOAP::Lite call in a client context. For example:

           my $client = SOAP::Lite
               -&gt;<a href="../man1/readable.1.html">readable</a>(1)
               -&gt;uri($NS)
               -&gt;proxy($HOST)
           $som = $client-&gt;someMethod();

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="../manmessage/new.message.html">new</a>(message)
               $som = SOAP::SOM-&gt;new($message_as_xml);

           As  said,  the  need  to actually create an object of this class should be very rare. However, if the
           need arises, the syntax must be followed. The single argument to new must be a valid XML document the
           parser will understand as a SOAP response.

       The following group of methods provide general data retrieval from the SOAP::SOM object.  The  model  for
       this  is  an abbreviated form of XPath. Following this group are methods that are geared towards specific
       retrieval of commonly requested elements.

       match(path)
               $som-&gt;match('/Envelope/Body/[1]');

           This method sets the internal pointers within the data structure so that the retrieval  methods  that
           follow will have access to the desired data. In the example path, the match is being made against the
           method  entity,  which  is  the  first  child  tag of the body in a SOAP response. The enumeration of
           container children starts at 1 in this syntax, not 0. The returned value is dependent on the  context
           of the call. If the call is made in a boolean context (such as "if ($som-&gt;match($path))"), the return
           value  is  a  boolean  indicating  whether  the  requested  path matched at all. Otherwise, an object
           reference is returned. The returned object is also a SOAP::SOM instance but  is  smaller,  containing
           the subset of the document tree matched by the expression.

       valueof(node)
               $res = $som-&gt;valueof('[1]');

           When  the  SOAP::SOM  object  has matched a path internally with the match method, this method allows
           retrieval of the data within any of the matched nodes. The data comes back as native Perl data, not a
           class instance (see dataof). In a scalar context, this method returns just the first element  from  a
           matched  node  set.  In  an  array context, all elements are returned. Assuming that the earlier call
           happens after the earlier call to match, it retrieves the result entity from the method response that
           is contained in $som, as this is the first child element in a method-response tag.

       dataof(node)
               $resobj = $som-&gt;dataof('[1]');

           Performs the same operation as the earlier valueof method, except  that  the  data  is  left  in  its
           SOAP::Data  form,  rather than being deserialized. This allows full access to all the attributes that
           were serialized along with the data, such as namespace and encoding.

       headerof(node)
               $resobj = $som-&gt;headerof('[1]');

           Acts much like dataof, except that it returns an object of the SOAP::Header class (covered  later  in
           this  chapter),  rather  than SOAP::Data. This is the preferred interface for manipulating the header
           entities in a message.

       namespaceuriof(node)
               $ns = $som-&gt;namespaceof('[1]');

           Retrieves the namespace URI that governs the requested node. Note that namespaces are  inherited,  so
           this method will return the relevant value, even if it derives from a parent or other ancestor node.

       The  following  methods provide more direct access to the message envelope. All these methods return some
       form of a Perl value, most often a hash reference, when called. Context is also  relevant:  in  a  scalar
       context only the first matching node is returned, while in an array context, all matching nodes are. When
       called  as a static method or as a regular function (such as "SOAP::SOM::envelope"), any of the following
       methods returns the XPath string that is used with the match method to retrieve the data.

       root
               $root = $som-&gt;root;

           Returns the value of the root element as a hash reference. It behaves exactly as "$som-"valueof('/')&gt;
           does.

       envelope
               $envelope = $som-&gt;envelope;

           Retrieves the "Envelope" element of the message, returning it and its data as a hash reference.  Keys
           in  the  hash  will  be Header and Body (plus any optional elements that may be present in a SOAP 1.1
           envelope), whose values will be the serialized header and body, respectively.

       header
               $header = $som-&gt;header;

           Retrieves the header portion of the envelope as a hash reference. All data within it will  have  been
           deserialized.  If  the  attributes  of  the  header are desired, the static form of the method can be
           combined with match to fetch the header as a SOAP::Data object:

               $header = $som-&gt;match(SOAP::SOM::header)-&gt;dataof;

       headers
               @hdrs = $som-&gt;headers;

           Retrieves the node set of values with deserialized headers from within the Header container. This  is
           different  from  the earlier header method in that it returns the whole header as a single structure,
           and this returns the child elements as an array. In other words, the following expressions yield  the
           same data structure:

               $header = ($som-&gt;headers)[0];
               $header = $som-&gt;valueof(SOAP::SOM::header.'/[1]');

       body
               $body = $som-&gt;body;

           Retrieves  the message body as a hash reference. The entity tags act as keys, with their deserialized
           content providing the values.

       fault
               if ($som-&gt;fault) { die $som-&gt;fault-&gt;faultstring }

           Acts both as a boolean test whether a fault occurred, and as a  way  to  retrieve  the  Fault  entity
           itself  from  the  message  body  as a hash reference. If the message contains a fault, the next four
           methods (faultcode, faultstring, faultactor, and faultdetail) may be used to retrieve the  respective
           parts  of  the  fault (which are also available on the hash reference as keys). If fault in a boolean
           context is true, the "result", "paramsin", "paramsout", and "method" methods all return "undef".

       faultcode
               $code = $som-&gt;faultcode;

           Returns the faultcode element of the fault if there is a fault; undef otherwise.

       faultstring
               $string = $som-&gt;faultstring;

           Returns the faultstring element of the fault if there is a fault; undef otherwise.

       faultactor
               $actor = $som-&gt;faultactor;

           Returns the faultactor element of the fault, if there is a fault  and  if  the  actor  was  specified
           within  it.  The faultactor element is optional in the serialization of a fault, so it may not always
           be present. This element is usually a string.

       faultdetail
               $detail = $som-&gt;faultdetail;

           Returns the content of the detail element of the fault, if there is a fault and if the detail element
           was provided. Note that the name of the element isn't the same as the method, due to the  possibility
           for  confusion  had the method been called simply, detail. As with the faultactor element, this isn't
           always a required component of a fault, so it isn't guaranteed to be present. The  specification  for
           the  detail  portion  of a fault calls for it to contain a series of element tags, so the application
           may expect a hash reference as a return  value  when  detail  information  is  available  (and  undef
           otherwise).

       method
               $method = $som-&gt;method

           Retrieves  the  "method"  element  of  the  message,  as  a  hash  reference. This includes all input
           parameters when called on a request message or all result/output parameters when called on a response
           message. If there is a fault present in the message, it returns undef.

       result
               $value = $som-&gt;result;

           Returns the value that is the result of a SOAP response. The value will be already deserialized  into
           a native Perl datatype.

       paramsin
               @list = $som-&gt;paramsin;

           Retrieves  the parameters being passed in on a SOAP request. If called in a scalar context, the first
           parameter is returned. When called in a list context, the full list of all  parameters  is  returned.
           Each parameter is a hash reference, following the established structure for such return values.

       paramsout
               @list = $som-&gt;paramsout;

           Returns  the output parameters from a SOAP response. These are the named parameters that are returned
           in addition to the explicit response entity itself. It shares the same scalar/list  context  behavior
           as the paramsin method.

       paramsall
               @list = $som-&gt;paramsall;

           Returns all parameters from a SOAP response, including the result entity itself, as one array.

       <b>parts()</b>
           Return an array of "MIME::Entity"'s if the current payload contains attachments, or returns undefined
           if payload is not MIME multipart.

       <b>is_multipart()</b>
           Returns true if payload is MIME multipart, false otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ACCESSING</b> <b>ELEMENT</b> <b>VALUES</b>
       Suppose for the following SOAP Envelope:

           &lt;Envelope&gt;
             &lt;Body&gt;
               &lt;fooResponse&gt;
                 &lt;bar&gt;abcd&lt;/bar&gt;
               &lt;/fooResponse&gt;
             &lt;/Body&gt;
           &lt;/Envelope&gt;

       And suppose you wanted to access the value of the bar element, then use the following code:

           my $soap = SOAP::Lite
               -&gt;uri($SOME_NS)
               -&gt;proxy($SOME_HOST);
           my $som = $soap-&gt;foo();
           print $som-&gt;valueof('//fooResponse/bar');

   <b>ACCESSING</b> <b>ATTRIBUTE</b> <b>VALUES</b>
       Suppose the following SOAP Envelope:

           &lt;Envelope&gt;
             &lt;Body&gt;
               &lt;c2fResponse&gt;
                 &lt;convertedTemp test="foo"&gt;98.6&lt;/convertedTemp&gt;
               &lt;/c2fResponse&gt;
             &lt;/Body&gt;
           &lt;/Envelope&gt;

       Then to print the attribute 'test' use the following code:

           print "The attribute is: " .
             $som-&gt;dataof('//c2fResponse/convertedTemp')-&gt;attr-&gt;{'test'};

   <b>ITERATING</b> <b>OVER</b> <b>AN</b> <b>ARRAY</b>
       Suppose for the following SOAP Envelope:

           &lt;Envelope&gt;
             &lt;Body&gt;
               &lt;catalog&gt;
                 &lt;product&gt;
                   &lt;title&gt;Programming Web Service with Perl&lt;/title&gt;
                   &lt;price&gt;$29.95&lt;/price&gt;
                 &lt;/product&gt;
                 &lt;product&gt;
                   &lt;title&gt;Perl Cookbook&lt;/title&gt;
                   &lt;price&gt;$49.95&lt;/price&gt;
                 &lt;/product&gt;
               &lt;/catalog&gt;
             &lt;/Body&gt;
           &lt;/Envelope&gt;

       If the SOAP Envelope returned contained an array, use the following code to iterate over the array:

           for my $t ($som-&gt;valueof('//catalog/product')) {
             print $t-&gt;{title} . " - " . $t-&gt;{price} . "\n";
           }

   <b>DETECTING</b> <b>A</b> <b>SOAP</b> <b>FAULT</b>
       A  SOAP::SOM  object  is returned by a SOAP::Lite client regardless of whether the call succeeded or not.
       Therefore, a SOAP Client is responsible for determining if the returned value is a fault or  not.  To  do
       so, use the <b>fault()</b> method which returns 1 if the SOAP::SOM object is a fault and 0 otherwise.

           my $som = $client-&gt;someMethod(@parameters);

           if ($som-&gt;fault) {
             print $som-&gt;faultdetail;
           } else {
             # do something
           }

   <b>PARSING</b> <b>ARRAYS</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ARRAYS</b>
       The most efficient way To parse and to extract data out of an array containing another array encoded in a
       SOAP::SOM object is the following:

           $xml = &lt;&lt;END_XML;
           &lt;foo&gt;
             &lt;person&gt;
               &lt;foo&gt;123&lt;/foo&gt;
               &lt;foo&gt;456&lt;/foo&gt;
             &lt;/person&gt;
             &lt;person&gt;
               &lt;foo&gt;789&lt;/foo&gt;
               &lt;foo&gt;012&lt;/foo&gt;
             &lt;/person&gt;
           &lt;/foo&gt;
           END_XML

           my $som = SOAP::Deserializer-&gt;deserialize($xml);
           my $i = 0;
           foreach my $a ($som-&gt;dataof("//person/*")) {
               $i++;
               my $j = 0;
               foreach my $b ($som-&gt;dataof("//person/[$i]/*")) {
                   $j++;
                   # do something
               }
           }
