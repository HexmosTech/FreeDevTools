</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Data::YAML::Writer - Easy YAML serialisation

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Data::YAML::Writer version 0.0.7

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Data::YAML::Writer;

           my $data = {
               one =&gt; 1,
               two =&gt; 2,
               three =&gt; [ 1, 2, 3 ],
           };

           my $yw = Data::YAML::Writer-&gt;new;

           # Write to an array...
           $yw-&gt;write( $data, \@some_array );

           # ...an open file handle...
           $yw-&gt;write( $data, $some_file_handle );

           # ...a string ...
           $yw-&gt;write( $data, \$some_string );

           # ...or a closure
           $yw-&gt;write( $data, sub {
               my $line = shift;
               print "$line\n";
           } );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Encodes a scalar, hash reference or array reference as YAML.

       In the spirit of YAML::Tiny this is a lightweight, dependency-free YAML writer. While "YAML::Tiny" is
       designed principally for working with configuration files "Data::YAML" concentrates on the transparent
       round-tripping of YAML serialized Perl data structures.

       The syntax produced by "Data::YAML::Writer" is a subset of YAML.  Specifically it is the same subset of
       YAML that Data::YAML::Reader consumes. See Data::YAML for more information.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       "new"
           The constructor "new" creates and returns an empty "Data::YAML::Writer" object.

       "write( $obj, $output )"
           Encode a scalar, hash reference or array reference as YAML.

               my $writer = sub {
                   my $line = shift;
                   print SOMEFILE "$line\n";
               };

               my $data = {
                   one =&gt; 1,
                   two =&gt; 2,
                   three =&gt; [ 1, 2, 3 ],
               };

               my $yw = Data::YAML::Writer-&gt;new;
               $yw-&gt;write( $data, $writer );

           The  $output  argument may be

           •   a reference to a scalar to append YAML to

           •   the handle of an open file

           •   a reference to an array into which YAML will be pushed

           •   a code reference

           If  you  supply  a code reference the subroutine will be called once for each line of output with the
           line as its only argument. Passed lines will have no trailing newline.
