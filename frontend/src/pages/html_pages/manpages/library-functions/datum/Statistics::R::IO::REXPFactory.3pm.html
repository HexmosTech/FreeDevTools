</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Statistics::R::IO::REXPFactory - Functions for parsing R data files

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.0002

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Statistics::R::IO::REXPFactory qw( unserialize );

           # Assume $data was created by reading, say, an RDS file
           my ($rexp, $state) = @{unserialize($data)}
               or die "couldn't parse";

           # If we're reading an RDS file, there should be no data left
           # unparsed
           die 'Unread data remaining in the RDS file' unless $state-&gt;eof;

           # the result of the unserialization is a REXP
           say $rexp;

           # REXPs can be converted to the closest native Perl data type
           print $rexp-&gt;to_pl;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements the actual reading of serialized R objects and their conversion to a
       Statistics::R::REXP. You are not expected to use it directly, as it's normally wrapped by "readRDS" in
       Statistics::R::IO and "readRData" in Statistics::R::IO.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       unserialize $data
           Constructs a Statistics::R::REXP object from its serialization in $data. Returns a pair of the object
           and the Statistics::R::IO::ParserState at the end of serialization.

       intsxp, langsxp, lglsxp, listsxp, rawsxp, realsxp, refsxp, strsxp, symsxp, vecsxp, envsxp, charsxp,
       cplxsxp, closxp, expsxp, s4sxp
           Parsers for the corresponding R SEXP-types.

       object_content
           Parses object info and its data by sequencing "unpack_object_info" and "object_data".

       unpack_object_info
           Parser  for serialized object info structure. Returns a hash with keys "is_object", "has_attributes",
           "has_tag", "object_type", and "levels", each corresponding to the field in R serialization  described
           in      &lt;<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html">http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html</a>#Serialization-Formats&gt;.       An
           additional key "flags" contains the full 32-bit value as stored in the file.

       object_data $obj_info
           Parser for a serialized R object, using the object type stored in $obj_info hash's "object_type"  key
           to use the correct parser for the particular type.

       vector_and_attributes $object_info, $element_parser, $rexp_class
           Convenience  parser  for  vectors,  which  are  serialized first with a SEXP for the vector elements,
           followed by attributes stored as a tagged  pairlist.  Attributes  are  stored  only  if  $object_info
           indicates their presence, while vector elements are parsed using $element_parser. Finally, the parsed
           attributes  and elements are used as arguments to the constructor of the $rexp_class, which should be
           a subclass of Statistics::R::REXP::Vector.

       header
           Parser for header of R serialization: the serialization  format  (XDR,  binary,  etc.),  the  version
           number  of the serialization (currently 2), and two 32-bit integers indicating the version of R which
           wrote the file followed by the minimal version of R needed to read the format.

       xdr, bin
           Parsers for RDS header indicating files in XDR or native-binary format.

       maybe_long_length
           Parser for vector length, allowing for the encoding of 64-bit long vectors introduced in R 3.0.

       tagged_pairlist_to_rexp_hash
           Converts a pairlist to a REXP hash whose keys are the pairlist's element tags and values the pairlist
           elements themselves.

       tagged_pairlist_to_attribute_hash
           Converts object attributes, which are serialized as a pairlist with attribute name in  the  element's
           tag, to a hash that can be used as the "attributes" argument to Statistics::R::REXP constructors.

           Some  attributes  are serialized using a compact encoding (for instance, when a table's row names are
           just integers 1:nrows), and this function will decode them to a complete REXP.
