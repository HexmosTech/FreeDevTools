       Data::Pond - Perl-based open notation for data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use Data::Pond qw($pond_datum_rx);

               if($expr =~ /\A$pond_datum_rx\z/o) { ...
               # and other regular expressions

               use Data::Pond qw(pond_read_datum pond_write_datum);

               $datum = pond_read_datum($text);
               $text = pond_write_datum($datum);
               $text = pond_write_datum($datum, { indent =&gt; 0 });

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is concerned with representing data structures in a textual notation known as "Pond" (<u>P</u>erl-
       based <u>o</u>pen <u>n</u>otation for <u>d</u>ata).  The notation is a strict subset of Perl expression syntax, but is
       intended to have language-independent use.  It is similar in spirit to JSON, which is based on
       JavaScript, but Pond represents fewer data types directly.

       The data that can be represented in Pond consist of strings (of characters), arrays, and string-keyed
       hashes.  Arrays and hashes can recursively (but not cyclically) contain any of these kinds of data.  This
       does not cover the full range of data types that Perl or other languages can handle, but is intended to
       be a limited, fixed repertoire of data types that many languages can readily process.  It is intended
       that more complex data can be represented using these basic types.  The arrays and hashes provide
       structuring facilities (ordered and unordered collections, respectively), and strings are a convenient
       way to represent atomic data.

       The Pond syntax is a subset of Perl expression syntax, consisting of string literals and constructors for
       arrays and hashes.  Strings may be single-quoted or double-quoted, or may be decimal integer literals.
       Double-quoted strings are restricted in which backslash sequences they can use: the permitted ones are
       the single-character ones (such as "\n"), "\x" sequences (such as "\xe3" and "\x{e3}"), and octal digit
       sequences (such as "\010").  Non-ASCII characters are acceptable in quoted strings.  Strings may also
       appear as pure-ASCII barewords, when they directly precede "=&gt;" in an array or hash constructor.  Array
       ("[]") and hash ("{}") constructors must contain data items separated by "," and "=&gt;" commas, and can
       have a trailing comma but not adjacent commas.  Whitespace is permitted where Perl allows it.  Control
       characters are not permitted, except for whitespace outside strings.

       A Pond expression can be "eval"ed by Perl to yield the data item that it represents, but this is not the
       recommended way to do it.  Any use of "eval" on data opens up security issues.  Instead use the
       "pond_read_datum" function of this module, which does not use Perl's parser but directly parses the
       restricted Pond syntax.

       This module is implemented in XS, with a pure Perl backup version for systems that can't handle XS.

</pre><h4><b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Each of these regular expressions corresponds precisely to part of Pond syntax.  The regular expressions
       do not include any anchors, so to check whether an entire string matches a production you must supply the
       anchors yourself.

       The regular expressions with "_ascii_" in the name match the subset of the grammar that uses only ASCII
       characters.  All Pond data can be expressed using only ASCII characters.

       $pond_string_rx
       $pond_ascii_string_rx
           A  string  literal.  This may be a double-quoted string, a single-quoted string, or a decimal integer
           literal.  It does not accept barewords.

       $pond_array_rx
       $pond_ascii_array_rx
           An array "[]" constructor.

       $pond_hash_rx
       $pond_ascii_hash_rx
           A hash "{}" constructor.

       $pond_datum_rx
       $pond_ascii_datum_rx
           Any permitted expression.  This may be a string literal, array constructor, or hash constructor.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       pond_read_datum(TEXT)
           <u>TEXT</u> is a character string.   This  function  parses  it  as  a  Pond-encoded  datum,  with  optional
           surrounding whitespace, returning the represented item as a Perl native datum.  "die"s if a malformed
           item is encountered.

       pond_write_datum(DATUM[, OPTIONS])
           <u>DATUM</u> is a Perl native datum.  This function serialises it as a character string using Pond encoding.
           The  data  to  be  serialised  can recursively contain Perl strings, arrays, and hashes.  Numbers are
           implicitly stringified, and "undef" is treated as the empty  string.   "die"s  if  an  unserialisable
           datum is encountered.

           <u>OPTIONS</u>, if present, must be a reference to a hash, containing options that control the serialisation
           process.  The recognised options are:

           <b>indent</b>
               If  "undef" (which is the default), no optional whitespace will be added.  Otherwise it must be a
               non-negative integer, and the datum will be laid out with whitespace (where it  is  optional)  to
               illustrate  the  structure by indentation.  The number given must be the number of leading spaces
               on the line on which the resulting element will be placed.  If whitespace is added,  the  element
               will  be  arranged to end on a line of the same indentation, and all intermediate lines will have
               greater indentation.

           <b>undef_is_empty</b>
               If false (the default), "undef" will be treated as  invalid  data.   If  true,  "undef"  will  be
               serialised as an empty string.

           <b>unicode</b>
               If  false  (the default), the datum will be expressed using only ASCII characters.  If true, non-
               ASCII characters may be used in string literals.
