</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Mixin::Linewise::Writers - get linewise writers for strings and filenames

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.111

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package Your::Pkg;
         use Mixin::Linewise::Writers -writers;

         sub write_handle {
           my ($self, $data, $handle) = @_;

           $handle-&gt;print("datum: $_\n") for @$data;
         }

       Then:

         use Your::Pkg;

         Your::Pkg-&gt;write_file($data, $filename);

         Your::Pkg-&gt;write_string($data, $string);

         Your::Pkg-&gt;write_handle($data, $fh);

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       "write_file" and "write_string" are exported by default.  Either can be requested individually, or
       renamed.  They are generated by Sub::Exporter, so consult its documentation for more information.

       Both can be generated with the option "method" which requests that a method other than "write_handle" is
       called with the created IO::Handle.

       If given a "binmode" option, any "write_file" type functions will use that as an IO layer, otherwise, the
       default is "encoding(UTF-8)".

         use Mixin::Linewise::Writers -writers =&gt; { binmode =&gt; "raw" };
         use Mixin::Linewise::Writers -writers =&gt; { binmode =&gt; "encoding(iso-8859-1)" };

   <b>write_file</b>
         Your::Pkg-&gt;write_file($data, $filename);
         Your::Pkg-&gt;write_file($data, $options, $filename);

       This method will try to open a new file with the given name.  It will then call "write_handle" with that
       handle.

       An optional hash reference may be passed before $filename with options.  The only valid option currently
       is "binmode", which overrides any default set from "use" or the built-in "encoding(UTF-8)".

       Any arguments after $filename are passed along after to "write_handle".

   <b>write_string</b>
         my $string = Your::Pkg-&gt;write_string($data);
         my $string = Your::Pkg-&gt;write_string(\%option, $data);

       "write_string" will create a new handle on the given string, then call "write_handle" to write to that
       handle, and return the resulting string.  Because handles on strings must be octet-oriented, the string
       <b>will</b> <b>contain</b> <b>octets</b>.  It will be opened in the default binmode established by importing.  (See "EXPORTS",
       above, and the options, below.)

       Any arguments after $data are passed along after to "write_handle".

       Like "write_file", this method can take a leading hashref with one valid argument: "binmode".
