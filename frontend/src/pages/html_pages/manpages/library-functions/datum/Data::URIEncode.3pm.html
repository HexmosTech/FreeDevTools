               },
           };

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The world of the web works off of URI's. The Query string portion of URIs already support encoding of
       key/value paired data - they just don't natively allow for for complex data structures.

       There are modules or encodings that do support arbitrarily complex data structures.  JSON, YAML and
       Data::Dumper all have their own way of encoding complex structures.  But then to pass them across the
       web, you usually still have to URL encode them and pass them via a form parameter.

       Data::URIEncode allows for encoding and decoding complex (multi level datastructures) using native Query
       String manipulators (such as CGI.pm).  It takes complex data and turns it into a flat hashref which can
       then be turned into a URI query string using URL encoding.  It also takes a flat hashref of data passed
       in and translates it back to a complex structure.

       One benefit of using Data::URIEncode is that a standard submission from a standard html form can
       automatically be translated into complex data even though it arrived in a "flat" form.  This somewhat
       mimics the abilities of XForms without introducing the complexity of XForms.

       Another benefit is that sparse data can be represented in a more compact form than JSON or YAML are able
       to provide.  However, complex data with long key names will be more verbose as the full data hierarchy
       must be repeated for each value.

</pre><h4><b>RULES</b></h4><pre>
       For each of the following rules, the $data can be translated to $flat and $query by calling
       complex_to_flat and complex_to_query respectively.  The $flat and $query can be translated back into
       $data using flat_to_complex and query_to_complex respectively.

       Simple values stay simple
               $data  =   {key =&gt; "val", key2 =&gt; "val2"};
               $flat  === {key =&gt; "val", key2 =&gt; "val2"};
               $query eq  "key=val&amp;key2=val2"

       Nested hashes use a dot to modify the key.
               $data  =   {key =&gt; {key2 =&gt; "val"}};
               $flat  === {"key.key2" =&gt; "val"};
               $query eq  "key.key2=val

               ########

               $data  =   {foo =&gt; {bar =&gt; {baz =&gt; "bling"}}};
               $flat  === {"foo.bar.baz" = "bling"};
               $query eq  "foo.bar.baz=bling"

       Nested arrays use a colon to modify the key.
               $data  =   {key =&gt; ["val1", "val2"]};
               $flat  === {"key:0" =&gt; "val1", "key:1" =&gt; "val2"};
               $query eq  "key:0=val1&amp;key:1=val2"

               ########

               $data  =   {key =&gt; [ [ ["val"] ] ]};
               $flat  === {"key:0:0" =&gt; "val"}
               $query eq  "key:0:0=val"

       Data structures can have an arrayref as the top level
           A leading colon is used to indicate the top level node is an arrayref.

               $data  =   ["val1", "val2"]
               $flat  === {":0" =&gt; "val1", ":1" =&gt; "val2"}
               $query eq  ":0=&gt;val1&amp;:1=&gt;val2"

               ########

               $data  =   [ [ ["val"] ] ];
               $flat  === {":0:0:0" =&gt; "val"}
               $query eq  ":0:0:0=val"

       Keys in flat hashrefs MAY begin with a leading dot
           A leading dot may disambiguate some cases.

               $query =   ".foo=bar"
               $flat  =   {".foo" =&gt; "bar"}
               $data  === {foo =&gt; "bar"}

       Single quotes may be used to enclose complex strings.
           Any  key  containing  a colon ":", a dot ".", or a single quote "'" must be quoted with single quotes
           and have enclosed single quotes escaped.

               $data  =   {"foo.bar"   =&gt; "baz"}
               $flat  === {"'foo.bar'" =&gt; "baz"}
               $query eq  "'foo.bar'=baz"  # the ' will be swapped with %27

               ########

               $data  =   {"foo:bar"   =&gt; "baz"}
               $flat  === {"'foo:bar'" =&gt; "baz"}
               $query eq  "'foo:bar'=baz"  # the ' will be swapped with %27

               ########

               $data  =   {""   =&gt; "baz"}
               $flat  === {"''" =&gt; "baz"}
               $query eq  "''=baz"  # the ' will be swapped with %27

               ########

               $data  =   {"'"     =&gt; "baz"}
               $flat  === {"'\\''" =&gt; "baz"}
               $query eq  "'\\''=baz"  # the ' will be swapped with %27 and the \ will be replaced with %5C

           Single quotes were chosen as double quotes are most  commonly  used  in  HTML  forms,  thus  allowing
           escaped single quotes more easily inside the double quoted name.

       Undefined values are not included in the flattened data
               $data  =   {foo =&gt; undef, bar =&gt; 1}
               $flat  === {bar =&gt; 1}
               $query eq  "bar=1"

               ########

               $data  =   ["val1", undef, "val2"]
               $flat  === {":0" =&gt; "val1", ":2" =&gt; "val2"}
               $query eq  ":0=val1&amp;:2=val2"

       Blessed hashes and arrayrefs are dumped by default.
           Changing the default value of the global $DUMP_BLESSED_DATA variable changes the behavior.

               $Data::URIEncode::DUMP_BLESSED_DATA = 1; # default
               $data  =   {foo =&gt; bless({bar =&gt; "baz"}, "main"), one =&gt; "two"}
               $flat  === {"foo.bar" =&gt; "baz", one =&gt; "two"}
               $query eq  "foo.bar=baz&amp;one=two"

               ########

               $Data::URIEncode::DUMP_BLESSED_DATA = 0;
               $data  =   {foo =&gt; bless({bar =&gt; "baz"}, "main"), one =&gt; "two"}
               $flat  === {one =&gt; "two"}
               $query eq  "one=two"

       Arrays created by flat_to_complex and query_to_complex must obey the value of the $MAX_ARRAY_EXPAND
       variable.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       flat_to_complex
           Takes  a  hashref  of  simple  key value pairs.  Returns a data structure based on the the parsed key
           value pairs.  The parsing proceeds according to the rules listed in RULES.

               my $data = flat_to_complex({"foo.bar.baz:2" =&gt; "bling"});
               # $data = {foo =&gt; {bar =&gt; {baz =&gt; [undef, undef, "bling"]}}};

       complex_to_flat
           Takes a complex data structure and turns it into a flat hashref (single level key/value pairs  only).
           The parsing proceeds according to the rules listed in RULES.

               my $flat = complex_to_flat({foo =&gt; ['a','b']});
               # $flat = {"foo:0" =&gt; "a", "foo:1" =&gt; "b"});

       complex_to_query
           Similar  to  complex_to_flat,  except that the flattened hashref is then translated into query string
           suitable for use in a URI.

               my $str = complex_to_query({foo =&gt; ['a','b']});
               # $str eq "foo:0=a&amp;foo:1=b"

       query_to_complex
           Takes one of a string, a reference to a string, a hash, or a CGI.pm compatible object and  translates
           it  into  a complex data structure.  Similar to flat_to_complex, exempt that a first step is taken to
           access the query parameters from the CGI compatible object or string.  If a string or string  ref  is
           given, the CGI module is used to parse the string into an initial flat hash of key value pairs (using
           the param method).  If another module is desired over, CGI.pm you must initialize it with the data to
           be parsed prior to passing the object to the query_to_complex function.

               my $data = query_to_complex("foo.bar:0=baz");

               my $data = query_to_complex(\ "foo.bar:0=baz");

               my $data = query_to_complex({"foo.bar:0" =&gt; "baz"}); # same as flat_to_complex

               my $cgi  = CGI-&gt;new(\ "foo.bar:0=baz");
               my $data = query_to_complex($cgi);

               my $cgi  = CGI-&gt;new; # use the values passed in from STDIN
               my $data = query_to_complex($cgi);

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       $MAX_ARRAY_EXPAND
           Default  value  is  100.   This variable is used to determine how large flat_to_complex will allow an
           array to be expanded beyond its current size.  An array can grow as large as  you  have  memory,  but
           intermediate values must exist.

           Without this value, somebody could specify foo:1000000000000=bar and your server would attempt to set
           the 1000000000000th index of the foo value to bar.

           The string "foo:101=bar" would die, but the string "foo:50=bar&amp;foo:101=baz" would not die because the
           intermediate  foo-&gt;[50]  increments  the  foo  arrayref  by  51  and  the  subsequent foo-&gt;[101] call
           increments the foo arrayref by only 51.

       $DUMP_BLESSED_DATA
           Default is true.  If true, blessed hashrefs and arrayrefs  will  also  be  added  to  the  flat  data
           returned by complex_to_flat.  If false, bless hashrefs and arrayrefs will be skipped.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Circular  refs  are  not  detected.   Any  attempt to dump a struture with cirular refs will result in an
       infinite loop.  There is no immediate plan to add circular ref tracking.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       All of the following have attempted to solve the same problem as Data::URIEncode.  All of them (including
       Data::URIEncode) suffer from the problem of being hard to find for the specific  purpose.   Hash::Flatten
       is probably the only suitable replacement for Data::URIEncode.

       Hash::Flatten

       CGI::Expand

       HTTP::Rollup

       CGI::State
