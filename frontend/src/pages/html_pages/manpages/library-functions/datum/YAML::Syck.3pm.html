</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       YAML::Syck - Fast, lightweight YAML loader and dumper

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use YAML::Syck;

           # Set this for interoperability with other YAML/Syck bindings:
           # e.g. Load('Yes') becomes 1 and Load('No') becomes ''.
           $YAML::Syck::ImplicitTyping = 1;

           $data = Load($yaml);
           $yaml = Dump($data);

           # $file can be an IO object, or a filename
           $data = LoadFile($file);
           DumpFile($file, $data);

           # A string with multiple YAML streams in it
           $yaml = Dump(@data);
           @data = Load($yaml);

           # Dumping into a pre-existing output buffer
           my $yaml;
           DumpInto(\$yaml, @data);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a Perl interface to the <b>libsyck</b> data serialization library.  It exports the "Dump"
       and "Load" functions for converting Perl data structures to YAML strings, and the other way around.

       <b>NOTE</b>: If you are working with other language's YAML/Syck bindings (such as Ruby), please set
       $YAML::Syck::ImplicitTyping to 1 before calling the "Load"/"Dump" functions.  The default setting is for
       preserving backward-compatibility with "YAML.pm".

</pre><h4><b>Differences</b> <b>Between</b> <b>YAML::Syck</b> <b>and</b> <b>YAML</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Error</b> <b>handling</b>
       Some calls are designed to die rather than returning YAML. You should wrap your calls in eval to assure
       you do not get unexpected results.

</pre><h4><b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$YAML::Syck::Headless</b>
       Defaults to false.  Setting this to a true value will make "Dump" omit the leading "---\n" marker.

   <b>$YAML::Syck::SortKeys</b>
       Defaults to false.  Setting this to a true value will make "Dump" sort hash keys.

   <b>$YAML::Syck::SingleQuote</b>
       Defaults to false.  Setting this to a true value will make "Dump" always emit single quotes instead of
       bare strings.

   <b>$YAML::Syck::ImplicitTyping</b>
       Defaults to false.  Setting this to a true value will make "Load" recognize various implicit types in
       YAML, such as unquoted "true", "false", as well as integers and floating-point numbers.  Otherwise, only
       "~" is recognized to be "undef".

   <b>$YAML::Syck::ImplicitUnicode</b>
       Defaults to false.  For Perl 5.8.0 or later, setting this to a true value will make "Load" set Unicode
       flag on for every string that contains valid UTF8 sequences, and make "Dump" return a unicode string.

       Regardless of this flag, Unicode strings are dumped verbatim without escaping; byte strings with high-bit
       set will be dumped with backslash escaping.

       However, because YAML does not distinguish between these two kinds of strings, so this flag will affect
       loading of both variants of strings.

       If you want to use LoadFile or DumpFile with unicode, you are required to open your own file in order to
       assure it's UTF8 encoded:

         open(my $fh, "&gt;:encoding(UTF-8)", "out.yml");
         DumpFile($fh, $hashref);

   <b>$YAML::Syck::ImplicitBinary</b>
       Defaults to false.  For Perl 5.8.0 or later, setting this to a true value will make "Dump" generate
       Base64-encoded "!!binary" data for all non-Unicode scalars containing high-bit bytes.

   <b>$YAML::Syck::UseCode</b> <b>/</b> <b>$YAML::Syck::LoadCode</b> <b>/</b> <b>$YAML::Syck::DumpCode</b>
       These flags control whether or not to try and eval/deparse perl source code; each of them defaults to
       false.

       Setting $YAML::Syck::UseCode to a true value is equivalent to setting both $YAML::Syck::LoadCode and
       $YAML::Syck::DumpCode to true.

   <b>$YAML::Syck::LoadBlessed</b>
       Defaults to false. Setting to true will allow YAML::Syck to bless objects as it imports objects. This
       default changed in 1.32.

       You can create any kind of object with YAML. The creation itself is not the critical part. If the class
       has a DESTROY method, it will be called once the object is deleted. An example with File::Temp removing
       files can be found at &lt;https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=862373&gt;

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Dumping Glob/IO values do not work yet.

       Dumping of Tied variables is unsupported.

       Dumping into tied (or other magic variables) with "DumpInto" might not work properly in all cases.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements the YAML 1.0 spec.  To deal with data in YAML 1.1, please use the "YAML::XS"
       module instead.

       The current implementation bundles libsyck source code; if your system has a site-wide shared libsyck, it
       will <u>not</u> be used.

       Tag names such as "!!perl/hash:Foo" is blessed into the package "Foo", but the "!hs/foo" and "!!hs/Foo"
       tags are blessed into "hs::Foo".  Note that this holds true even if the tag contains non-word characters;
       for example, "!haskell.org/Foo" is blessed into "haskell.org::Foo".  Please use Class::Rebless to cast it
       into other user-defined packages. You can also set the LoadBlessed flag false to disable all blessing.

       This module has a lot of known issues &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=YAML-Syck&gt; and
       has only been semi-actively maintained since 2007. If you encounter an issue with it probably won't be
       fixed unless you offer up a patch &lt;<a href="http://github.com/toddr/YAML-Syck">http://github.com/toddr/YAML-Syck</a>&gt; in Git that's ready for release.

       There are still good reasons to use this module, such as better interoperability with other syck wrappers
       (like Ruby's), or some edge case of YAML's syntax that it handles better. It'll probably work perfectly
       for you, but if it doesn't you may want to look at YAML::XS, or perhaps at looking another serialization
       format like JSON.
