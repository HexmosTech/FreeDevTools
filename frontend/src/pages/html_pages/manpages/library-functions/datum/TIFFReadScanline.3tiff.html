</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       TIFFReadScanline - read and decode a scanline of data from an open TIFF file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          #include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;

       <b>int</b> <b>TIFFReadScanline(TIFF</b> <b>*tif,</b> <b>tdata_t</b> <b>buf,</b> <b>uint32_t</b> <b>row,</b> <b>tsample_t</b> <b>sample)</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Read  the  data  for  the  specified row into the (user supplied) data buffer <u>buf</u>.  The data are returned
       decompressed and, in the native byte- and bit-ordering, but are otherwise packed (see further below). The
       buffer must be large enough to hold an entire scanline of data.  Applications  should  call  the  routine
       <u>TIFFScanlineSize()</u>  to  find  out  the size (in bytes) of a scanline buffer.  The <u>row</u> parameter is always
       used by <u>TIFFReadScanline()</u>; the <u>sample</u> parameter is used only if data are organized  in  separate  planes
       (<b>PlanarConfiguration</b> = 2).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  library attempts to hide bit- and byte-ordering differences between the image and the native machine
       by converting data to the native machine order.  Bit reversal is done if the <b>FillOrder</b> tag is opposite to
       the native machine bit order. 16- and 32-bit samples are  automatically  byte-swapped  if  the  file  was
       written with a byte order opposite to the native machine byte order,

       In C++ the <u>sample</u> parameter defaults to 0.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>TIFFReadScanline()</u> returns -1 if it detects an error; otherwise 1 is returned.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       All error messages are directed to the <u>TIFFErrorExtR()</u> routine.

       <b>"Compression</b> <b>algorithm</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>random</b> <b>access"</b>:
          Data  was  requested  in a non-sequential order from a file that uses a compression algorithm and that
          has <b>RowsPerStrip</b> greater than one.  That is, data in the image is stored in  a  compressed  form,  and
          with  multiple  rows  packed into a strip. In this case, the library does not support random access to
          the data. The data should either be accessed sequentially, or the file should  be  converted  so  that
          each strip is made up of one row of data.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Reading subsampled YCbCR data does not work correctly because, for <b>PlanarConfiguration</b> = 2, the size of a
       scanline  is  not calculated on a per-sample basis, and for <b>PlanarConfiguration</b> = 1, the library does not
       unpack the block-interleaved samples; use the strip- and tile-based interfaces to read these formats.
