       The <b>XRRScreenSize</b> structure contains a possible root size in pixels and in millimeters.

       A  <b>XRRScreenChangeNotifyEvent</b>  is  sent  to  a client that has requested notification whenever the screen
       configuration is changed. A client can perform  this  request  by  calling  <b>XRRSelectInput</b>,  passing  the
       display, the root window, and the <b>RRScreenChangeNotifyMask</b> mask.

       <b>XRRScreenConfiguration</b> is an opaque data type containing the configuration information for a screen.

       <b>Timestamps</b>

       Time  stamps  are  included and must be used to ensure the client is playing with a full deck: the screen
       may change properties on the fly and this ensures its knowledge of the configuration is up to date.  This
       is to help issues when screens may become hot-pluggable in the future.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Xrandr</b> is a simple library designed to interface the X Resize and Rotate Extension.  This allows  clients
       to  change  the  size  and rotation of the root window of a screen, along with the ability to reflect the
       screen about either  axis  (if  supported  by  the  implementation).   Rotation  and  reflection  may  be
       implemented  by  software and may result in slower performance if rotation and reflection are implemented
       in this fashion (as are all implementations as of October 2002).

       The Xrandr library does some minimal caching to avoid  roundtrips  to  provide  clients  frequently  used
       information.   See  "The  X Resize and Rotate Extension" for a detailed description; also note that depth
       switching, as described in the document is not implemented, and may (or may not) ever be implemented,  as
       display  memory  is  growing rapidly, and toolkits are already beginning to support migration, mitigating
       the need for depth switching.  If it is implemented in the future, we expect  to  do  so  via  an  upward
       compatible  extension  to  the  current library/protocol; functionality described here should continue to
       work.

       Rotation and reflection and how they interact can be confusing.   In  Randr,  the  coordinate  system  is
       rotated  in  a  counter-clockwise  direction relative to the normal orientation.  Reflection is along the
       window system coordinate system, not the physical screen X and Y axis, so that rotation and reflection do
       not interact.  The other way to consider  reflection  is  to  treat  it  as  specified  in  the  "normal"
       orientation, before rotation.

       The  <b>XRRScreenChangeNotify</b>  event  is  sent  to  clients that ask to be informed whenever the root window
       configuration changes.  Configuration changes may include resolution, physical size, subpixel order  (see
       <a href="../man3/XRender.3.html">XRender</a>(3)),  and  rotation.  Note that changes to any or all of these could occur due to external events
       (user control in the X server, a different monitor/flat panel display being hot-plugged) and is not  only
       the result of a protocol/library request to the X server.

       Additionally,  to  eliminate  a  potential  race  condition, this event may be generated immediately upon
       selecting for notification if the screen has changed since the  client  of  Xrandr  connected  to  the  X
       server, to enable reliable screen resolution changing when a user may log in and change the configuration
       while one or many clients are starting up.

       <b>Xlib</b> <b>notification</b>

       Clients  must  call  back  into Xlib using <b>XRRUpdateConfiguration</b> when screen configuration change notify
       events are generated (or  root  window  configuration  changes  occur,  to  update  Xlib's  view  of  the
       resolution,  size,  rotation,  reflection  or  subpixel  order.   Generally,  toolkits  will perform this
       operation on behalf of applications; we did not want to change display structure data behind the back  of
       toolkits,  as  in  multithreaded  clients,  various race conditions might occur.  Toolkits should provide
       clients some mechanism for notification of screen change, of course.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are two classes of interfaces: those which can be safely called even if RandR is not implemented on
       a screen (to make common idioms not dependent on the server having support), and those which will  return
       errors if the extension is not present.

       <b>XRRRotations</b> returns both the possible set of rotations/reflections supported (as a bitmask) as the value
       of the function, along with the current rotation/reflection of the screen.

       <b>XRRSizes</b>  returns  the  size  and  a pointer to the current sizes supported by the specified screen.  The
       first size specified is the default size of the server. If RandR is not supported, it returns 0  for  the
       number of sizes.

       <b>XRRRates</b>  returns  a pointer to the rates supported by the specified size.  If RandR is not supported, it
       returns 0 for the number of rates.

       <b>XRRTimes</b> returns the time last reported by the server along with the  timestamp  the  last  configuration
       changed.   If  the  configuration  has changed since the client last updated its view of the server time,
       requests to change the configuration will fail until the client has an up to date timestamp.

       <b>XRRRootToScreen</b>  returns  the   screen   number   given   a   root   window   (for   example,   from   an
       <b>XRRScreenChangeNotifyEvent</b>).

       The  rest  of  the  functions  will  fail  if  applied  to  screens not implementing the RandR extension.
       <b>XRRSetScreenConfig</b> sets the screen size and rotation and reflection to the desired values on  the  screen
       specified  by  <u>draw</u>, or returns a <b>BadValue</b> error.  <u>size_index</u> specifies which size configuration is to be
       used, <u>rotation</u> specifies which rotation or reflection is to be used (or a <b>BadValue</b>  error  is  returned).
       The  <u>timestamp</u>  is  used  by the server to make sure the client has up to date configuration information.
       Status is returned to indicate success or failure; a client must refresh its configuration information if
       it fails and try the call again (by calling <b>XRRGetScreenInfo</b>).

       <b>XRRSetScreenConfigAndRate</b> is like <b>XRRSetScreenConfig</b> but also sets the refresh rate. If specified rate is
       not supported a <b>BadValue</b> error is returned.

       <b>XRRConfigRotations,</b> <b>XRRConfigSizes,</b> <b>XRRConfigCurrentConfiguration,</b>  <b>XRRConfigTimes,</b>  <b>XRRConfigRates,</b>  and
       <b>XRRConfigCurrentRate</b> are used to get specific configuration information out of a screen configuration.

       <b>XRRGetScreenInfo</b> returns a screen configuration for later use; the information is private to the library.
       Call  <b>XRRFreeScreenConfigInfo</b>  to free this information when you are finished with it.  It forces a round
       trip to the server.

       Other functions include: <b>XRRQueryExtension</b> which returns the event and error base codes,  <b>XRRQueryVersion</b>
       , which returns the current version of the extension (this information is cached by the library).

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Xrandr</b> will remain upward compatible after the current 1.0 release.
