       pt::peg::from::json - PEG Conversion. Read JSON format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       package require <b>Tcl</b> <b>8.5</b> <b>9</b>

       package require <b>pt::peg::from::json</b> <b>?1.1?</b>

       package require <b>pt::peg</b>

       package require <b>json</b>

       <b>pt::peg::from::json</b> <b>convert</b> <u>text</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Are  you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In that case please read the overview
       provided by the <u>Introduction</u> <u>to</u> <u>Parser</u> <u>Tools</u>. This document is the entrypoint to  the  whole  system  the
       current package is a part of.

       This package implements the converter from JSON markup to parsing expression grammars.

       It  resides in the Import section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools, and can be used either directly with
       the other packages of this layer, or indirectly through the import manager provided  by  <b>pt::peg::import</b>.
       The latter is intented for use in untrusted environments and done through the corresponding import plugin
       <b>pt::peg::import::json</b> sitting between converter and import manager.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       The  API  provided  by  this package satisfies the specification of the Converter API found in the <u>Parser</u>
       <u>Tools</u> <u>Import</u> <u>API</u> specification.

       <b>pt::peg::from::json</b> <b>convert</b> <u>text</u>
              This command takes the JSON markup encoding a parsing expression grammar and  contained  in  <u>text</u>,
              and  generates  the  canonical  serialization  of  said  grammar,  as  specified  in  section  <b>PEG</b>
              <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>.  The created value is then returned as the result of the command.

</pre><h4><b>JSON</b> <b>GRAMMAR</b> <b>EXCHANGE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>json</b> format for parsing expression grammars was written as a data exchange format not bound  to  Tcl.
       It  was  defined  to  allow  the  exchange of grammars with PackRat/PEG based parser generators for other
       languages.

       It is formally specified by the rules below:

       [1]    The JSON of any PEG is a JSON object.

       [2]    This object holds a single key, <b>pt::grammar::peg</b>, and its value. This value holds the contents  of
              the grammar.

       [3]    The  contents  of  the  grammar  are  a JSON object holding the set of nonterminal symbols and the
              starting expression. The relevant keys and their values are

              <b>rules</b>  The value is a JSON object whose keys are the names of the nonterminal symbols known to the
                     grammar.

                     [1]    Each nonterminal symbol may occur only once.

                     [2]    The empty string is not a legal nonterminal symbol.

                     [3]    The value for each symbol is a JSON object  itself.  The  relevant  keys  and  their
                            values in this dictionary are

                            <b>is</b>     The  value  is  a  JSON  string  holding the Tcl serialization of the parsing
                                   expression describing the symbols sentennial structure, as specified  in  the
                                   section <b>PE</b> <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>.

                            <b>mode</b>   The  value  is  a  JSON  holding holding one of three values specifying how a
                                   parser should handle the semantic value produced by the symbol.

                                   <b>value</b>  The semantic value of the nonterminal symbol  is  an  abstract  syntax
                                          tree  consisting  of  a  single  node node for the nonterminal itself,
                                          which has the ASTs of the symbol's right hand side as its children.

                                   <b>leaf</b>   The semantic value of the nonterminal symbol  is  an  abstract  syntax
                                          tree consisting of a single node node for the nonterminal, without any
                                          children.  Any  ASTs  generated  by  the  symbol's right hand side are
                                          discarded.

                                   <b>void</b>   The nonterminal has no semantic  value.  Any  ASTs  generated  by  the
                                          symbol's right hand side are discarded (as well).

              <b>start</b>  The value is a JSON string holding the Tcl serialization of the start parsing expression of
                     the grammar, as specified in the section <b>PE</b> <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>.

       [4]    The  terminal  symbols  of the grammar are specified implicitly as the set of all terminal symbols
              used in the start expression and on the RHS of the grammar rules.

       As an aside to the advanced reader, this is pretty much the same as the Tcl serialization of PE grammars,
       as specified in section <b>PEG</b> <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>, except that the Tcl  dictionaries  and  lists  of  that
       format  are mapped to JSON objects and arrays. Only the parsing expressions themselves are not translated
       further, but kept as JSON strings containing a nested Tcl list, and there is no concept of canonicity for
       the JSON either.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       Assuming the following PEG for simple mathematical expressions

              PEG calculator (Expression)
                  Digit      &lt;- '0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'       ;
                  Sign       &lt;- '-' / '+'                                     ;
                  Number     &lt;- Sign? Digit+                                  ;
                  Expression &lt;- Term (AddOp Term)*                            ;
                  MulOp      &lt;- '*' / '/'                                     ;
                  Term       &lt;- Factor (MulOp Factor)*                        ;
                  AddOp      &lt;- '+'/'-'                                       ;
                  Factor     &lt;- '(' Expression ')' / Number                   ;
              END;

       a JSON serialization for it is

              {
                  "pt::grammar::peg" : {
                      "rules" : {
                          "AddOp"     : {

                              "mode" : "value"
                          },
                          "Digit"     : {
                              "is"   : "\/ {t 0} {t 1} {t 2} {t 3} {t 4} {t 5} {t 6} {t 7} {t 8} {t 9}",
                              "mode" : "value"
                          },
                          "Expression" : {
                              "is"   : "\/ {x {t (} {n Expression} {t )}} {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}",
                              "mode" : "value"
                          },
                          "Factor"    : {
                              "is"   : "x {n Term} {* {x {n AddOp} {n Term}}}",
                              "mode" : "value"
                          },
                          "MulOp"     : {
                              "is"   : "\/ {t *} {t \/}",
                              "mode" : "value"
                          },
                          "Number"    : {
                              "is"   : "x {? {n Sign}} {+ {n Digit}}",
                              "mode" : "value"
                          },
                          "Sign"      : {
                              "is"   : "\/ {t -} {t +}",
                              "mode" : "value"
                          },
                          "Term"      : {
                              "is"   : "n Number",
                              "mode" : "value"
                          }
                      },
                      "start" : "n Expression"
                  }
              }

       and a Tcl serialization of the same is

              pt::grammar::peg {
                  rules {
                      AddOp      {is {/ {t -} {t +}}                                                                mode value}
                      Digit      {is {/ {t 0} {t 1} {t 2} {t 3} {t 4} {t 5} {t 6} {t 7} {t 8} {t 9}}                mode value}
                      Expression {is {x {n Term} {* {x {n AddOp} {n Term}}}}                                        mode value}
                      Factor     {is {/ {x {t (} {n Expression} {t )}} {n Number}}                                  mode value}
                      MulOp      {is {/ {t *} {t /}}                                                                mode value}
                      Number     {is {x {? {n Sign}} {+ {n Digit}}}                                                 mode value}
                      Sign       {is {/ {t -} {t +}}                                                                mode value}
                      Term       {is {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}                                    mode value}
                  }
                  start {n Expression}
              }

       The similarity of the latter to the JSON should be quite obvious.

</pre><h4><b>PEG</b> <b>SERIALIZATION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Parsing Expression Grammars as immutable
       values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between <u>regular</u> and <u>canonical</u> serializations.  While a PEG may have more than one  regular
       serialization only exactly one of them will be <u>canonical</u>.

       regular serialization

              [1]    The serialization of any PEG is a nested Tcl dictionary.

              [2]    This  dictionary  holds a single key, <b>pt::grammar::peg</b>, and its value. This value holds the
                     contents of the grammar.

              [3]    The contents of the grammar are a Tcl dictionary holding the set of nonterminal symbols and
                     the starting expression. The relevant keys and their values are

                     <b>rules</b>  The value is a Tcl dictionary whose keys are the names of  the  nonterminal  symbols
                            known to the grammar.

                            [1]    Each nonterminal symbol may occur only once.

                            [2]    The empty string is not a legal nonterminal symbol.

                            [3]    The  value  for each symbol is a Tcl dictionary itself. The relevant keys and
                                   their values in this dictionary are

                                   <b>is</b>     The value is the serialization of the  parsing  expression  describing
                                          the  symbols  sentennial  structure,  as  specified  in the section <b>PE</b>
                                          <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>.

                                   <b>mode</b>   The value can be one of three values specifying how  a  parser  should
                                          handle the semantic value produced by the symbol.

                                          <b>value</b>  The  semantic  value  of  the nonterminal symbol is an abstract
                                                 syntax  tree  consisting  of  a  single  node  node   for   the
                                                 nonterminal  itself,  which  has the ASTs of the symbol's right
                                                 hand side as its children.

                                          <b>leaf</b>   The semantic value of the nonterminal  symbol  is  an  abstract
                                                 syntax   tree   consisting  of  a  single  node  node  for  the
                                                 nonterminal, without any children. Any ASTs  generated  by  the
                                                 symbol's right hand side are discarded.

                                          <b>void</b>   The  nonterminal  has  no semantic value. Any ASTs generated by
                                                 the symbol's right hand side are discarded (as well).

                     <b>start</b>  The value is the serialization of the start parsing expression of  the  grammar,  as
                            specified in the section <b>PE</b> <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>.

              [4]    The  terminal  symbols  of  the grammar are specified implicitly as the set of all terminal
                     symbols used in the start expression and on the RHS of the grammar rules.

       canonical serialization
              The canonical serialization of a grammar has the format as specified in  the  previous  item,  and
              then  additionally  satisfies  the  constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
              serializations of this grammar.

              [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are sorted in ascending dictionary order,
                     as generated by Tcl's builtin command <b>lsort</b> <b>-increasing</b> <b>-dict</b>.

              [2]    The string representation of the value is the canonical representation of a Tcl dictionary.
                     I.e. it does not contain superfluous whitespace.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       Assuming the following PEG for simple mathematical expressions

              PEG calculator (Expression)
                  Digit      &lt;- '0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'       ;
                  Sign       &lt;- '-' / '+'                                     ;
                  Number     &lt;- Sign? Digit+                                  ;
                  Expression &lt;- Term (AddOp Term)*                            ;
                  MulOp      &lt;- '*' / '/'                                     ;
                  Term       &lt;- Factor (MulOp Factor)*                        ;
                  AddOp      &lt;- '+'/'-'                                       ;
                  Factor     &lt;- '(' Expression ')' / Number                   ;
              END;

       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is

              pt::grammar::peg {

</pre><h4><b>PE</b> <b>SERIALIZATION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Parsing Expressions as immutable  values
       for transport, comparison, etc.

       We  distinguish  between  <u>regular</u> and <u>canonical</u> serializations.  While a parsing expression may have more
       than one regular serialization only exactly one of them will be <u>canonical</u>.

                     [1]    For  parsing  expressions <b>e1</b>, <b>e2</b>, ... the result of [list / <b>e1</b> <b>e2</b> ... ] is a parsing
                            expression as well.  This is the <u>ordered</u> <u>choice</u>, aka <u>prioritized</u> <u>choice</u>.

                     [2]    For parsing expressions <b>e1</b>, <b>e2</b>, ... the result of [list x <b>e1</b> <b>e2</b> ... ] is  a  parsing

                     [3]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list * <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>kleene</u> <u>closure</u>, describing zero or more repetitions.

                     [4]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list + <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>positive</u> <u>kleene</u> <u>closure</u>, describing one or more repetitions.

                     [5]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list &amp; <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>and</u> <u>lookahead</u> <u>predicate</u>.

                     [6]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list ! <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>not</u> <u>lookahead</u> <u>predicate</u>.

                     [7]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list ? <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>optional</u> <u>input</u>.

       Canonical serialization
              The  canonical  serialization  of a parsing expression has the format as specified in the previous
              item, and then additionally satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique  among  all  the
              possible serializations of this parsing expression.

              [1]    The  string representation of the value is the canonical representation of a pure Tcl list.
                     I.e. it does not contain superfluous whitespace.

              [2]    Terminals are <u>not</u> encoded as ranges (where start and end of the range are identical).

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       Assuming the parsing expression shown on the right-hand side of the rule

                  Expression &lt;- Term (AddOp Term)*

       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is

                  {x {n Term} {* {x {n AddOp} {n Term}}}}
