</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Are  you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In that case please read the overview
       provided by the <u>Introduction</u> <u>to</u> <u>Parser</u> <u>Tools</u>. This document is the entrypoint to  the  whole  system  the
       current package is a part of.

       This package implements the converter from parsing expression grammars to CPARAM markup.

       It  resides in the Export section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools, and can be used either directly with
       the other packages of this layer, or indirectly through the export manager provided  by  <b>pt::peg::export</b>.
       The latter is intented for use in untrusted environments and done through the corresponding export plugin
       <b>pt::peg::export::cparam</b> sitting between converter and export manager.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       The  API  provided  by  this package satisfies the specification of the Converter API found in the <u>Parser</u>
       <u>Tools</u> <u>Export</u> <u>API</u> specification.

       <b>pt::peg::to::cparam</b> <b>reset</b>
              This command resets the configuration of the package to its default settings.

       <b>pt::peg::to::cparam</b> <b>configure</b>
              This command returns a dictionary containing the current configuration of the package.

       <b>pt::peg::to::cparam</b> <b>configure</b> <u>option</u>
              This command returns the current value of the specified configuration <u>option</u> of the  package.  For
              the set of legal options, please read the section <b>Options</b>.

       <b>pt::peg::to::cparam</b> <b>configure</b> <u>option</u> <u>value</u>...
              This command sets the given configuration <u>option</u>s of the package, to the specified <u>value</u>s. For the
              set of legal options, please read the section <b>Options</b>.

       <b>pt::peg::to::cparam</b> <b>convert</b> <u>serial</u>
              This  command  takes  the canonical serialization of a parsing expression grammar, as specified in
              section <b>PEG</b> <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>, and contained in <u>serial</u>, and generates  CPARAM  markup  encoding
              the  grammar,  per  the current package configuration.  The created string is then returned as the
              result of the command.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The converter to C code recognizes the following configuration variables and  changes  its  behaviour  as
       they specify.

       <b>-file</b> string
              The  value of this option is the name of the file or other entity from which the grammar came, for
              which the command is run. The default value is <b>unknown</b>.

       <b>-name</b> string
              The value of this option is the name of the grammar we  are  processing.   The  default  value  is
              <b>a_pe_grammar</b>.

       <b>-user</b> string
              The  value  of this option is the name of the user for which the command is run. The default value
              is <b>unknown</b>.

       <b>-template</b> string
              The value of this option is a  string  into  which  to  put  the  generated  text  and  the  other
              configuration  settings. The various locations for user-data are expected to be specified with the
              placeholders listed below. The default value is "<b>@code@</b>".

              <b>@user@</b> To be replaced with the value of the option <b>-user</b>.

              <b>@format@</b>
                     To be replaced with the the constant <b>C/PARAM</b>.

              <b>@file@</b> To be replaced with the value of the option <b>-file</b>.

              <b>@name@</b> To be replaced with the value of the option <b>-name</b>.

              <b>@code@</b> To be replaced with the generated Tcl code.

              The following options are special, in that they will occur within  the  generated  code,  and  are
              replaced there as well.

              <b>@statedecl@</b>
                     To be replaced with the value of the option <b>state-decl</b>.

              <b>@stateref@</b>

              <b>@strings@</b>
                     To be replaced with the value of the option <b>string-varname</b>.

              <b>@self@</b> To be replaced with the value of the option <b>self-command</b>.

              <b>@def@</b>  To be replaced with the value of the option <b>fun-qualifier</b>.

              <b>@ns@</b>   To be replaced with the value of the option <b>namespace</b>.

              <b>@main@</b> To be replaced with the value of the option <b>main</b>.

              <b>@prelude@</b>
                     To be replaced with the value of the option <b>prelude</b>.

       <b>-state-decl</b> string
              A  C  string  representing  the  argument declaration to use in the generated parsing functions to
              refer to the parsing state. In essence type and argument name.  The default value  is  the  string
              <b>RDE_PARAM</b> <b>p</b>.

       <b>-state-ref</b> string
              A C string representing the argument named used in the generated parsing functions to refer to the
              parsing state.  The default value is the string <b>p</b>.

       <b>-self-command</b> string
              A  C  string representing the reference needed to call the generated parser function (methods ...)
              from another parser fonction, per the chosen framework (template).  The default value is the empty
              string.

       <b>-fun-qualifier</b> string
              A C string containing the attributes to give to the generated functions  (methods  ...),  per  the
              chosen framework (template).  The default value is <b>static</b>.

       <b>-namespace</b> string
              The  name  of  the  C  namespace the parser functions (methods, ...) shall reside in, or a general
              prefix to add to the function names.  The default value is the empty string.

       <b>-main</b> string
              The name of the main function (method, ...) to be called by the  chosen  framework  (template)  to
              start parsing input.  The default value is <b>__main</b>.

       <b>-string-varname</b> string
              The  name  of  the variable used for the table of strings used by the generated parser, i.e. error
              messages, symbol names, etc.  The default value is <b>p_string</b>.

       <b>-prelude</b> string
              A snippet of code to be inserted at the head of each  generated  parsing  function.   The  default
              value is the empty string.

       <b>-indent</b> integer
              The number of characters to indent each line of the generated code by.  The default value is <b>0</b>.

       <b>-comments</b> boolean
              A  flag  controlling  the generation of code comments containing the original parsing expression a
              parsing function is for.  The default value is <b>on</b>.

       While the high parameterizability of this converter, as shown by the multitude of options it supports, is
       an advantage to the advanced user, allowing her to customize the output of the  converter  as  needed,  a
       novice user will likely not see the forest for the trees.

       To  help  these latter users an adjunct package is provided, containing a canned configuration which will
       generate immediately useful full parsers. It is

       <b>pt::cparam::configuration::critcl</b>
              Generated parsers are embedded into a <b>Critcl</b>-based framework.

</pre><h4><b>C/PARAM</b> <b>CODE</b> <b>REPRESENTATION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>PARSING</b> <b>EXPRESSION</b> <b>GRAMMARS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>c</b> format is executable code, a parser for the grammar. The parser implementation is written in C  and
       can be tweaked to the users' needs through a multitude of options.

       The  <b>critcl</b>  format, for example, is implemented as a canned configuration of these options on top of the
       generator for <b>c</b>.

       The bulk of such a framework has to be specified through the option <b>-template</b>. The additional options

       <b>-fun-qualifier</b> string

       <b>-main</b> string

       <b>-namespace</b> string

       <b>-prelude</b> string

       <b>-self-command</b> string

       <b>-state-decl</b> string

       <b>-state-ref</b> string

       <b>-string-varname</b> string

       provide code snippets which help to glue framework and generated code together. Their placeholders are in
       the <u>generated</u> code.  Further the options

       <b>-indent</b> integer

       <b>-comments</b> boolean

       allow for the customization of the code indent (default none), and whether to generate  comments  showing
       the parsing expressions a function is for (default on).

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       We  are  forgoing  an  example of this representation, with apologies.  It would be way to large for this
       document.

</pre><h4><b>PEG</b> <b>SERIALIZATION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Parsing Expression Grammars as immutable
       values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between <u>regular</u> and <u>canonical</u> serializations.  While a PEG may have more than one  regular
       serialization only exactly one of them will be <u>canonical</u>.

       regular serialization

              [1]    The serialization of any PEG is a nested Tcl dictionary.

              [2]    This  dictionary  holds a single key, <b>pt::grammar::peg</b>, and its value. This value holds the
                     contents of the grammar.

              [3]    The contents of the grammar are a Tcl dictionary holding the set of nonterminal symbols and
                     the starting expression. The relevant keys and their values are

                     <b>rules</b>  The value is a Tcl dictionary whose keys are the names of  the  nonterminal  symbols
                            known to the grammar.

                            [1]    Each nonterminal symbol may occur only once.

                            [2]    The empty string is not a legal nonterminal symbol.

                            [3]    The  value  for each symbol is a Tcl dictionary itself. The relevant keys and
                                   their values in this dictionary are

                                   <b>is</b>     The value is the serialization of the  parsing  expression  describing
                                          the  symbols  sentennial  structure,  as  specified  in the section <b>PE</b>
                                          <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>.

                                   <b>mode</b>   The value can be one of three values specifying how  a  parser  should
                                          handle the semantic value produced by the symbol.

                                          <b>value</b>  The  semantic  value  of  the nonterminal symbol is an abstract
                                                 syntax  tree  consisting  of  a  single  node  node   for   the
                                                 nonterminal  itself,  which  has the ASTs of the symbol's right
                                                 hand side as its children.

                                          <b>leaf</b>   The semantic value of the nonterminal  symbol  is  an  abstract
                                                 syntax   tree   consisting  of  a  single  node  node  for  the
                                                 nonterminal, without any children. Any ASTs  generated  by  the
                                                 symbol's right hand side are discarded.

                                          <b>void</b>   The  nonterminal  has  no semantic value. Any ASTs generated by
                                                 the symbol's right hand side are discarded (as well).

                     <b>start</b>  The value is the serialization of the start parsing expression of  the  grammar,  as
                            specified in the section <b>PE</b> <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>.

              [4]    The  terminal  symbols  of  the grammar are specified implicitly as the set of all terminal
                     symbols used in the start expression and on the RHS of the grammar rules.

       canonical serialization
              The canonical serialization of a grammar has the format as specified in  the  previous  item,  and
              then  additionally  satisfies  the  constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
              serializations of this grammar.

              [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are sorted in ascending dictionary order,
                     as generated by Tcl's builtin command <b>lsort</b> <b>-increasing</b> <b>-dict</b>.

              [2]    The string representation of the value is the canonical representation of a Tcl dictionary.
                     I.e. it does not contain superfluous whitespace.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       Assuming the following PEG for simple mathematical expressions

              PEG calculator (Expression)
                  Digit      &lt;- '0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'       ;
                  Sign       &lt;- '-' / '+'                                     ;
                  Number     &lt;- Sign? Digit+                                  ;
                  Expression &lt;- Term (AddOp Term)*                            ;
                  MulOp      &lt;- '*' / '/'                                     ;
                  Term       &lt;- Factor (MulOp Factor)*                        ;
                  AddOp      &lt;- '+'/'-'                                       ;
                  Factor     &lt;- '(' Expression ')' / Number                   ;
              END;

       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is

              pt::grammar::peg {
                  rules {
                      AddOp      {is {/ {t -} {t +}}                                                                mode value}
                      Digit      {is {/ {t 0} {t 1} {t 2} {t 3} {t 4} {t 5} {t 6} {t 7} {t 8} {t 9}}                mode value}
                      Expression {is {x {n Term} {* {x {n AddOp} {n Term}}}}                                        mode value}
                      Factor     {is {/ {x {t (} {n Expression} {t )}} {n Number}}                                  mode value}
                      MulOp      {is {/ {t *} {t /}}                                                                mode value}
                      Number     {is {x {? {n Sign}} {+ {n Digit}}}                                                 mode value}
                      Sign       {is {/ {t -} {t +}}                                                                mode value}
                      Term       {is {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}                                    mode value}
                  }
                  start {n Expression}
              }

</pre><h4><b>PE</b> <b>SERIALIZATION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Parsing Expressions as immutable  values
       for transport, comparison, etc.

       We  distinguish  between  <u>regular</u> and <u>canonical</u> serializations.  While a parsing expression may have more
       than one regular serialization only exactly one of them will be <u>canonical</u>.

       Regular serialization

              <b>Atomic</b> <b>Parsing</b> <b>Expressions</b>

                     [1]    The string <b>epsilon</b> is an atomic parsing expression. It matches the empty string.

                     [2]    The string <b>dot</b> is an atomic parsing expression. It matches any character.

                     [3]    The string <b>alnum</b> is an atomic parsing expression. It matches any Unicode alphabet or
                            digit character. This is a custom extension of PEs based on  Tcl's  builtin  command
                            <b>string</b> <b>is</b>.

                     [4]    The  string  <b>alpha</b>  is an atomic parsing expression. It matches any Unicode alphabet
                            character. This is a custom extension of PEs based on Tcl's builtin  command  <b>string</b>
                            <b>is</b>.

                     [5]    The  string  <b>ascii</b> is an atomic parsing expression. It matches any Unicode character

              <b>Combined</b> <b>Parsing</b> <b>Expressions</b>

                     [1]    For  parsing  expressions <b>e1</b>, <b>e2</b>, ... the result of [list / <b>e1</b> <b>e2</b> ... ] is a parsing
                            expression as well.  This is the <u>ordered</u> <u>choice</u>, aka <u>prioritized</u> <u>choice</u>.

                     [2]    For parsing expressions <b>e1</b>, <b>e2</b>, ... the result of [list x <b>e1</b> <b>e2</b> ... ] is  a  parsing
                            expression as well.  This is the <u>sequence</u>.

                     [3]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list * <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>kleene</u> <u>closure</u>, describing zero or more repetitions.

                     [4]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list + <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>positive</u> <u>kleene</u> <u>closure</u>, describing one or more repetitions.

                     [5]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list &amp; <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>and</u> <u>lookahead</u> <u>predicate</u>.

                     [6]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list ! <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>not</u> <u>lookahead</u> <u>predicate</u>.

                     [7]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list ? <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>optional</u> <u>input</u>.

       Canonical serialization
              The  canonical  serialization  of a parsing expression has the format as specified in the previous
              item, and then additionally satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique  among  all  the
              possible serializations of this parsing expression.

              [1]    The  string representation of the value is the canonical representation of a pure Tcl list.
                     I.e. it does not contain superfluous whitespace.

              [2]    Terminals are <u>not</u> encoded as ranges (where start and end of the range are identical).

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       Assuming the parsing expression shown on the right-hand side of the rule

                  Expression &lt;- Term (AddOp Term)*

       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is

                  {x {n Term} {* {x {n AddOp} {n Term}}}}
