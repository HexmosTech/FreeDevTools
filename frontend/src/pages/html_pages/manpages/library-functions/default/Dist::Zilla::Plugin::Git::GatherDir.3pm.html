</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::GatherDir - Gather all tracked files in a Git working directory

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.051

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       In your <u>dist.ini</u>:

           [Git::GatherDir]
           root = .                     ; this is the default
           prefix =                     ; this is the default
           include_dotfiles = 0         ; this is the default
           include_untracked = 0        ; this is the default
           exclude_filename = dir/skip  ; there is no default
           exclude_match = ^local_      ; there is no default

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a trivial variant of the GatherDir plugin.  It looks in the directory named in the "root"
       attribute and adds all the Git tracked files it finds there (as determined by "git ls-files").  If the
       root begins with a tilde, the tilde portion is passed through glob() first.

       Most users just need:

         [Git::GatherDir]

       ...and this will pick up all tracked files from the current directory into the dist.  You can use it
       multiple times, as you can any other plugin, by providing a plugin name.  For example, if you want to
       include external specification files into a subdir of your dist, you might write:

         [Git::GatherDir]
         ; this plugin needs no config and gathers most of your files

         [Git::GatherDir / SpecFiles]
         ; this plugin gets all tracked files in the root dir and adds them under ./spec
         root   = <a href="file:~/projects/my-project/spec">~/projects/my-project/spec</a>
         prefix = spec

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       This plugin inherits attributes from Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GatherDir, with the following modifications:

   <b>root</b>
       See "root" in Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GatherDir.  It does not need to be the root of a Git repository, but
       it must be inside a repository.

   <b>include_untracked</b>
       By default, files not tracked by Git will not be gathered.  If this is set to a true value, then
       untracked files not covered by a Git ignore pattern (i.e. those reported by "git ls-files -o
       --exclude-standard") are also gathered (and you'll probably want to use Git::Check to ensure all files
       are checked in before a release).

       "include_untracked" requires at least Git 1.5.4, but you should probably not use it if your Git is older
       than 1.6.5.2.  Versions before that would not list files matched by your <u>.gitignore</u>, even if they were
       already being tracked by Git (which means they will not be gathered, even though they should be).
       Whether that is a problem depends on the contents of your exclude files (including the global one, if
       any).

   <b>follow_symlinks</b>
       Git::GatherDir does not honor GatherDir's follow_symlinks option.  While the attribute exists (because
       Git::GatherDir is a subclass), setting it has no effect.

       Directories that are symlinks will not be gathered.  Instead, you'll get a message saying "WARNING: %s is
       symlink to directory, skipping it".  To suppress the warning, add that directory to "exclude_filename" or
       "exclude_match".  To gather the files in the symlinked directory, use a second instance of GatherDir or
       Git::GatherDir with appropriate "root" and "prefix" options.

       Files which are symlinks are always gathered.
