</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Component::Client::Ping is non-blocking ICMP ping client.  It lets several other sessions ping
       through it in parallel, and it lets them continue doing other things while they wait for responses.

       Ping client components are not proper objects.  Instead of being created, as most objects are, they are
       "spawned" as separate sessions.  To avoid confusion (and hopefully not cause other confusion), they must
       be spawned with a "spawn" method, not created anew with a "new" one.

       PoCo::Client::Ping's "spawn" method takes a few named parameters:

       Alias =&gt; $session_alias
         "Alias"  sets  the  component's alias.  It is the target of <b>post()</b> calls.  See the synopsis.  The alias
         defaults to "pinger".

       Socket =&gt; $raw_socket
         "Socket" allows developers to open an existing raw socket rather than  letting  the  component  attempt
         opening one itself.  If omitted, the component will create its own raw socket.

         This is useful for people who would rather not perform a security audit on POE, since it allows them to
         create a raw socket in their own code and then run POE at reduced privileges.

       Timeout =&gt; $ping_timeout
         "Timeout"  sets  the  default  amount of time (in seconds) a Ping component will wait for a single ICMP
         echo reply before retrying.  It is 1 by default.  It is possible and meaningful to set the timeout to a
         fractional number of seconds.

         This default timeout is only used for ping requests that don't include their own timeouts.

       Retry =&gt; $ping_attempts
         "Retry" sets the default number of attempts a ping will be sent before it should be considered  failed.
         It is 1 by default.

       OneReply =&gt; 0|1
         Set  "OneReply"  to  prevent  the  Ping  component  from  waiting  the full timeout period for replies.
         Normally the ICMP protocol allows for multiple replies to a single request, so it's proper to wait  for
         late responses.  This option disables the wait, ending the ping transaction at the first response.  Any
         subsequent responses will be silently ignored.

         "OneReply"  is  disabled  by  default,  and  a  single  successful  request  will generate at least two
         responses.  The first response is a successful ICMP ECHO REPLY  event.   The  second  is  an  undefined
         response event, signifying that the timeout period has ended.

         A  ping  request will generate exactly one reply when "OneReply" is enabled.  This reply will represent
         either the first ICMP ECHO REPLY to arrive or that the timeout period has ended.

       Parallelism =&gt; $limit
         Parallelism sets POE::Component::Client::Ping's maximum number of simultaneous ICMP  requests.   Higher
         numbers  speed  up  the  processing  of large host lists, up to the point where the operating system or
         network becomes oversaturated and begin to drop packets.

         The difference can be dramatic.  A tuned Parallelism can enable responses down to 1ms, depending on the
         network, although it will take longer to get through the hosts list.

           Pinging 762 hosts at Parallelism=64
           Starting to ping hosts.
           Pinged 10.0.0.25       - Response from 10.0.0.25       in  0.002s
           Pinged 10.0.0.200      - Response from 10.0.0.200      in  0.003s
           Pinged 10.0.0.201      - Response from 10.0.0.201      in  0.001s

           real  1m1.923s
           user  0m2.584s
           sys   0m0.207s

         Responses will take significantly longer with an untuned Parallelism, but the total run  time  will  be
         quicker.

           Pinging 762 hosts at Parallelism=500
           Starting to ping hosts.
           Pinged 10.0.0.25       - Response from 10.0.0.25       in  3.375s
           Pinged 10.0.0.200      - Response from 10.0.0.200      in  1.258s
           Pinged 10.0.0.201      - Response from 10.0.0.201      in  2.040s

           real  0m13.410s
           user  0m6.390s
           sys   0m0.290s

         Excessively high parallelism values may saturate the OS or network, resulting in few or no responses.

           Pinging 762 hosts at Parallelism=1000
           Starting to ping hosts.

           real  0m20.520s
           user  0m7.896s
           sys   0m0.297s

         By  default,  POE::Component::Client::Ping  will guess at an optimal Parallelism value based on the raw
         socket receive buffer size and the operating system's nominal ICMP packet size.  The latter  figure  is
         3000 octets for Linux and 100 octets for other systems.  ICMP packets are generally under 90 bytes, but
         operating  systems may use alternative numbers when calculating buffer capacities.  The component tries
         to mimic calculations observed in the wild.

         When in doubt, experiment with different Parallelism values and use the one that works best.

       BufferSize =&gt; $bytes
         If set, then the size of the receive buffer of the raw socket will be modified to the given value.  The
         default  size  of  the receive buffer is operating system dependent. If the buffer cannot be set to the
         given value, a warning will be generated but the system will continue working. Note that if the  buffer
         is  set  too  small  and  too  many ping replies arrive at the same time, then the operating system may
         discard the ping replies and mistakenly cause this component to believe the ping to have timed out.  In
         this case, you will typically see discards being noted in the counters displayed by 'netstat -s'.

         Increased BufferSize values can expand the practical limit for Parallelism.

       AlwaysDecodeAddress =&gt; 0|1
         If  set,  then  any input addresses will always be looked up, even if the hostname happens to be only 4
         characters in size.  Ideally, you should be passing addresses in to the system to avoid  slow  hostname
         lookups,  but if you must use hostnames and there is a possibility that you might have short hostnames,
         then you should set this.

       Payload =&gt; $bytes
         Sets the ICMP payload (data bytes).  Otherwise the component generates 56 data bytes internally.   Note
         that some firewalls will discard ICMP packets with nonstandard payload sizes.

       Sessions  communicate asynchronously with the Client::Ping component.  They post ping requests to it, and
       they receive pong events back.

       Requests are posted to the component's "ping" handler.  They include the name of an event to  post  back,
       an  address  to ping, and an optional amount of time to wait for responses.  The address may be a numeric
       dotted quad, a packed inet_aton address, or a host name.  Host names are not recommended:  they  must  be
       looked  up  for every ping request, and DNS lookups can be very slow.  The optional timeout overrides the
       one set when "spawn" is called.

       Ping responses come with two array references:

         my ($request, $response) = @_[ARG0, ARG1];

       $request contains information about the original request:

         my (
           $req_address, $req_timeout, $req_time, $req_user_args,
         ) = @$request;

       $req_address
         This is the original request address.  It matches the address posted along  with  the  original  "ping"
         request.

         It is useful along with $req_user_args for pairing requests with their corresponding responses.

       $req_timeout
         This  is  the  original  request  timeout.   It's  either the one passed with the "ping" request or the
         default timeout set with "spawn".

       $req_time
         This is the time that the "ping" event was received by the Ping component.  It is a real  number  based
         on the current system's <b>time()</b> epoch.

       $req_user_args
         This  is  a scalar containing arbitrary data that can be sent along with a request.  It's often used to
         provide continuity between requests and their responses.  $req_user_args may  contain  a  reference  to
         some larger data structure.

         To  use  it,  replace  the  response  event with an array reference in the original request.  The array
         reference should contain two items: the actual response event and a scalar with the  context  data  the
         program needs back.  See the SYNOPSIS for an example.

       $response  contains  information  about  the  ICMP  ping response.  There may be multiple responses for a
       single request.

         my ($response_address, $roundtrip_time, $reply_time, $reply_ttl) =
         @$response;

       $response_address
         This  is  the  address  that  responded  to  the  ICMP  echo  request.   It  may  be   different   than
         $request_address, especially if the request was sent to a broadcast address.

         $response_address  will  be  undefined if $request_timeout seconds have elapsed.  This marks the end of
         responses for a given request.  Programs can assume that no more responses will be sent for the request
         address.  They may use this marker to initiate another ping request.

       $roundtrip_time
         This is the number of seconds that elapsed  between  the  ICMP  echo  request's  transmission  and  its
         corresponding  response's  receipt.   It's  a  real number. This is purely the trip time and does *not*
         include any time spent queueing if the system's parallelism limit caused the ping  transmission  to  be
         delayed.

       $reply_time
         This  is  the  time when the ICMP echo response was received.  It is a real number based on the current
         system's <b>time()</b> epoch.

       $reply_ttl
         This is the ttl for the echo response packet we received.

       If the ":const" tagset is imported the following constants will be exported:

       REQ_ADDRESS, REQ_TIMEOUT, REQ_TIME REQ_USER_ARGS, RES_ADDRESS, RES_ROUNDTRIP, RES_TIME, RES_TTL

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       This component's ICMP ping code was lifted from Net::Ping, which is an excellent  module  when  you  only
       need to ping one host at a time.

       See POE, of course, which includes a lot of documentation about how POE works.

       Also see the test program, t/01_ping.t, in the component's distribution.
