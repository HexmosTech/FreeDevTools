</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Component::Jabber::XMPP - connect using the XMPP Jabber protocol

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This is a Protocol implementation for the specifics in the XMPP protocol during connection
       initialization.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       PCJ::XMPP provides all the mechanisms to negotiate TLS, SASL, resource binding, and session negotiation
       that PCJ needs to successfully establish an XMPP connection. In essence, it implements XMPP Core and a
       smidgeon of XMPP IM.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Please see PCJ::Protocol for what methods this class supports.

</pre><h4><b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Listed are the exported events that make their way into the PCJ session:

       set_auth
         This handles the initial SASL authentication portion of the XMPP connection.

       init_input_handler
         This is our entry point. This is what PCJ uses to deliver events to us.

       build_tls_wheel
         If TLS is required by the server, this is where that negotiation process happens.

       challenge_response
         This handles the subsequent SASL authentication steps.

       binding
         This handles the resource binding

       session_establish
         This handles session binding.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Currently,  only  DIGEST-MD5  and PLAIN SASL mechanisms are supported. Server implementations are free to
       include more strigent mechanisms, but these are the bare minimum  required.  (And  PLAIN  isn't  /really/
       allowed by the spec, but it is included because it was a requested feature)

       The  underlying  backend  has  changed  this  release  to  now  use  a  new  Node implementation based on
       XML::LibXML::Element. Please see POE::Filter::XML::Node documentation for the relevant API changes.
