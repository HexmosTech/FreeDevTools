</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "Protocol::IRC" - IRC protocol handling

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This mix-in class provides a base layer of IRC message handling logic. It allows reading of IRC messages
       from a string buffer and dispatching them to handler methods on its instance.

       Protocol::IRC::Client provides an extension to this logic that may be more convenient for IRC client
       implementations. Much of the code provided here is still useful in client applications, so the reader
       should be familiar with both modules.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGE</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       Every incoming message causes a sequence of message handling to occur. First, the message is parsed, and
       a hash of data about it is created; this is called the hints hash. The message and this hash are then
       passed down a sequence of potential handlers.

       Each handler indicates by return value, whether it considers the message to have been handled. Processing
       of the message is not interrupted the first time a handler declares to have handled a message. Instead,
       the hints hash is marked to say it has been handled. Later handlers can still inspect the message or its
       hints, using this information to decide if they wish to take further action.

       A message with a command of "COMMAND" will try handlers in following places:

       1.  A method called "on_message_COMMAND"

            $irc-&gt;on_message_COMMAND( $message, \%hints )

       2.  A method called "on_message"

            $irc-&gt;on_message( 'COMMAND', $message, \%hints )

       For  server  numeric  replies,  if  the numeric reply has a known name, it will be attempted first at its
       known name, before falling back to the numeric if it was  not  handled.  Unrecognised  numerics  will  be
       attempted only at their numeric value.

       Because  of  the  wide  variety  of  messages in IRC involving various types of data the message handling
       specific cases for certain types of message, including adding extra hints hash items, or  invoking  extra
       message handler stages. These details are noted here.

       Many  of these messages create new events; called synthesized messages. These are messages created by the
       "Protocol::IRC" object itself, to better represent some of the details derived from the primary ones from
       the server.  These events all take lower-case command names,  rather  than  capitals,  and  will  have  a
       "synthesized" key in the hints hash, set to a true value. These are dispatched and handled identically to
       regular primary events, detailed above.

       If  any  handler  of the synthesized message returns true, then this marks the primary message handled as
       well.

       If a message is received that has a gating disposition, extra processing is  applied  to  it  before  the
       processing above. The effect on its gate is given as a string (one of "more", "done", "fail") to handlers
       in the following places:

       1.  A method called "on_message_gate_EFFECT_GATE"

            $irc-&gt;on_message_gate_EFFECT_GATE( $message, \%hints )

       2.  A method called "on_message_gate_EFFECT"

            $irc-&gt;on_message_gate_EFFECT( 'GATE', $message, \%hints )

       3.  A method called "on_message_gate"

            $irc-&gt;on_message_gate( 'EFFECT', 'GATE', $message, \%hints )

   <b>Message</b> <b>Hints</b>
       When messages arrive they are passed to the appropriate message handling method, which the implementation
       may  define.  As well as the message, a hash of extra information derived from or relating to the message
       is also given.

       The following keys will be present in any message hint hash:

       handled =&gt; BOOL
               Initially false. Will be set to true the first time a handler returns a true value.

       prefix_nick =&gt; STRING
       prefix_user =&gt; STRING
       prefix_host =&gt; STRING
               Values split from the message prefix; see the "Protocol::IRC::Message" "prefix_split" method.

       prefix_name =&gt; STRING
               Usually the prefix nick, or the hostname in case  the  nick  isn't  defined  (usually  on  server
               messages).

       prefix_is_me =&gt; BOOL
               True if the nick mentioned in the prefix refers to this connection.

       Added  to  this  set, will be all the values returned by the message's "named_args" method. Some of these
       values may cause yet more values to be generated.

       If the message type defines a "target_name":

       •       target_type =&gt; STRING

               Either "channel" or "user", as returned by "classify_name".

       •       target_is_me =&gt; BOOL

               True if the target name is a user and refers to this connection.

       Any key whose name ends in "_nick" or "_name" will have a corresponding key added with "_folded" suffixed
       on its name, containing the value casefolded using "casefold_name". This is for the convenience of string
       comparisons, hash keys, etc..

       Any of these keys that are not the "prefix_name" will additionally have a corresponding key with "_is_me"
       replacing the "_nick" or "_name", containing the boolean result of calling  the  "is_nick_me"  method  on
       that  name.  This  makes  it  simpler  to  detect  commands  or results affecting the user the connection
       represents.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>on_read</b>
          $irc-&gt;on_read( $buffer )

       Informs the protocol implementation that more bytes have been read from the peer. This method will modify
       the $buffer directly, and remove from it the prefix of bytes it has consumed. Any bytes remaining  should
       be stored by the caller for next time.

       Any messages found in the buffer will be passed, in sequence, to the "incoming_message" method.

   <b>incoming_message</b>
          $irc-&gt;incoming_message( $message )

       Invoked  by  the  "on_read"  method  for  every  incoming  IRC message. This method implements the actual
       dispatch into various handler methods as described in the "MESSAGE HANDLING" section above.

       This method is exposed so that subclasses can override it, primarily to wrap extra logic before or  after
       the main dispatch (e.g. for logging or other processing).

   <b>send_message</b>
       This method takes arguments in three different forms, depending on their number and type.

       If  the first argument is a reference then it must contain a "Protocol::IRC::Message" instance which will
       be sent directly:

          $irc-&gt;send_message( $message )

       Otherwise, the first argument must be a plain string that gives the command name. If the second  argument
       is   a   hash,   it   provides   named   arguments   in   a  form  similar  to  "new_from_named_args"  in
       Protocol::IRC::Message, otherwise the remaining arguments must be the prefix string and other  positional
       arguments, as plain strings:

          $irc-&gt;send_message( $command, { %args } )

          $irc-&gt;send_message( $command, $prefix, @args )

       <u>Named</u> <u>Argument</u> <u>Mangling</u>

       For symmetry with incoming message processing, this method applies some adjustment of named arguments for
       convenience of callers.

       •   Callers may define a named argument of "target"; it will be renamed to "target_name".

       •   If  a named argument of "text" is defined and an "encoder" exists, the argument value will be encoded
           using this encoder.

   <b>send_ctcp</b>
          $irc-&gt;send_ctcp( $prefix, $target, $verb, $argstr )

       Shortcut to sending a CTCP message. Sends a PRIVMSG to the given target, containing the  given  verb  and
       argument string.

   <b>send_ctcpreply</b>
          $irc-&gt;send_ctcpreply( $prefix, $target, $verb, $argstr )

       Shortcut to sending a CTCP reply. As "send_ctcp" but using a NOTICE instead.

</pre><h4><b>ISUPPORT-DRIVEN</b> <b>UTILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods are controlled by the server information given in the "ISUPPORT" settings. They use
       the "isupport" required method to query the information required.

   <b>casefold_name</b>
          $name_folded = $irc-&gt;casefold_name( $name )

       Returns  the $name, folded in case according to the server's "CASEMAPPING" "ISUPPORT". Such a folded name
       will compare using "eq" according to whether the server would consider it the same name.

       Useful for use in hash keys or similar.

   <b>cmp_prefix_flags</b>
          $cmp = $irc-&gt;cmp_prefix_flags( $lhs, $rhs )

       Compares two channel occupant prefix flags, and returns a signed integer to indicate which  of  them  has
       higher  priviledge,  according  to  the  server's  ISUPPORT  declaration.  Suitable for use in a "sort()"
       function or similar.

   <b>cmp_prefix_modes</b>
          $cmp = $irc-&gt;cmp_prefix_modes( $lhs, $rhs )

       Similar to "cmp_prefix_flags", but compares channel occupant "MODE" command flags.

   <b>prefix_mode2flag</b>
          $flag = $irc-&gt;prefix_mode2flag( $mode )

       Converts a channel occupant "MODE" flag (such as "o") into a name prefix flag (such as "@").

   <b>prefix_flag2mode</b>
          $mode = $irc-&gt;prefix_flag2mode( $flag )

       The inverse of "prefix_mode2flag".

   <b>classify_name</b>
          $classification = $irc-&gt;classify_name( $name )

       Returns "channel" if the given name matches the pattern of names allowed for channels  according  to  the
       server's "CHANTYPES" "ISUPPORT". Returns "user" if not.

   <b>is_nick_me</b>
          $me = $irc-&gt;is_nick_me( $nick )

       Returns true if the given nick refers to that in use by the connection.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>MESSAGE</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       The following messages are handled internally by "Protocol::IRC".

   <b>PING</b>
       "PING" messages are automatically replied to with "PONG".

   <b>NOTICE</b> <b>and</b> <b>PRIVMSG</b>
       Because  "NOTICE"  and  "PRIVMSG"  are so similar, they are handled together by synthesized events called
       "text", "ctcp" and "ctcpreply". Depending on the contents of the text, and whether it was supplied  in  a
       "PRIVMSG" or a "NOTICE", one of these three events will be created.

       In all cases, the hints hash will contain a "is_notice" key being true or false, depending on whether the
       original  messages was a "NOTICE" or a "PRIVMSG", a "target_name" key containing the message target name,
       a case-folded version of the name in a "target_name_folded" key, and a classification of the target  type
       in a "target_type" key.

       For  the "user" target type, it will contain a boolean in "target_is_me" to indicate if the target of the
       message is the user represented by this connection.

       For the "channel" target type, it will  contain  a  "restriction"  key  containing  the  channel  message
       restriction, if present.

       For normal "text" messages, it will contain a key "text" containing the actual message text.

       For  either  CTCP message type, it will contain keys "ctcp_verb" and "ctcp_args" with the parsed message.
       The "ctcp_verb" will contain the first space-separated token, and "ctcp_args" will be a string containing
       the rest of the line, otherwise unmodified. This type of message is also subject to a  special  stage  of
       handler dispatch, involving the CTCP verb string. For messages with "VERB" as the verb, the following are
       tried. "CTCP" may stand for either "ctcp" or "ctcpreply".

       1.  A method called "on_message_CTCP_VERB"

            $irc-&gt;on_message_CTCP_VERB( $message, \%hints )

       2.  A method called "on_message_CTCP"

            $irc-&gt;on_message_CTCP( 'VERB', $message, \%hintss )

       3.  A method called "on_message"

            $irc-&gt;on_message( 'CTCP VERB', $message, \%hints )

</pre><h4><b>REQUIRED</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       As  this class is an abstract base class, a concrete implementation must provide the following methods to
       complete it and make it useable.

   <b>write</b>
          $irc-&gt;write( $string )

       Requests the byte string to be sent to the peer

   <b>encoder</b>
          $encoder = $irc-&gt;encoder

       Optional. If supplied, returns an Encode object used to encode or decode the bytes appearing in a  "text"
       field  of  a message. If set, all text strings will be returned, and should be given, as Unicode strings.
       They will be encoded or decoded using this object.

   <b>invoke</b>
          $result = $irc-&gt;invoke( $name, @args )

       Optional. If provided, invokes the message handling routine called $name  with  the  given  arguments.  A
       default  implementation is provided which simply attempts to invoke a method of the given name, or return
       false if no method of that name exists.

       If an implementation does override this method, care should be taken to ensure that  methods  are  tested
       for  and  invoked  if present, in addition to any other work the method wishes to perform, as this is the
       basis by which derived message handling works.

   <b>isupport</b>
          $value = $irc-&gt;isupport( $field )

       Should return the value of the given "ISUPPORT" field.

       As well as the all-capitals server-supplied fields, the following fields may be  requested.  Their  names
       are all lowercase and contain underscores, to distinguish them from server-supplied fields.

       prefix_modes =&gt; STRING
               The mode characters from "PREFIX" (e.g. "ohv")

       prefix_flags =&gt; STRING
               The flag characters from "PREFIX" (e.g. "@%+")

       prefixflag_re =&gt; Regexp
               A precompiled regexp that matches any of the prefix flags

       prefix_map_m2f =&gt; HASH
               A map from mode characters to flag characters

       prefix_map_f2m =&gt; HASH
               A map from flag characters to mode characters

       chanmodes_list =&gt; ARRAY
               A 4-element array containing the split portions of "CHANMODES";

                [ $listmodes, $argmodes, $argsetmodes, $boolmodes ]

       channame_re =&gt; Regexp
               A  precompiled  regexp  that  matches  any  string  beginning  with a channel prefix character in
               "CHANTYPES".

   <b>nick</b>
          $nick = $irc-&gt;nick

       Should return the current nick in use by the connection.

   <b>nick_folded</b>
          $nick_folded = $irc-&gt;nick_folded

       Optional. If supplied, should return the current nick as case-folded by the  "casefold_name"  method.  If
       not provided, this will be performed by case-folding the result from "nick".
