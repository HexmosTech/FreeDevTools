   <b>Requirements</b>
       You  need  to  install  the  perl module Perl::LanguageServer to make this extension work, e.g. run "cpan
       Perl::LanguageServer" on your target system.

       Please make sure to always run the newest version of Perl::LanguageServer as well.

       NOTE: Perl::LanguageServer depend on AnyEvent::AIO and Coro. There is a warning that this might not  work
       with newer Perls. It works fine for Perl::LanguageServer. So just confirm the warning and install it.

       Perl::LanguageServer  depends  on other Perl modules. It is a good idea to install most of then with your
       linux package manager.

       e.g. on Debian/Ubuntu run:

            sudo apt install libanyevent-perl libclass-refresh-perl libcompiler-lexer-perl \
            libdata-dump-perl libio-aio-perl libjson-perl libmoose-perl libpadwalker-perl \
            libscalar-list-utils-perl libcoro-perl

            sudo cpan Perl::LanguageServer

       e.g. on Centos 7 run:

             sudo yum install perl-App-cpanminus perl-AnyEvent-AIO perl-Coro
             sudo cpanm Class::Refresh
             sudo cpanm Compiler::Lexer
             sudo cpanm Hash::SafeKeys
             sudo cpanm Perl::LanguageServer

       In case any of the above packages are not available for your os version, just leave them  out.  The  cpan
       command  will  install  missing  dependencies.  In  case the test fails, when running cpan "install", you
       should try to run "force install".

       •   "pathMap":   mapping   of   local   to  remote  paths  for  this  debug  session  (overwrites  global
           "perl.path_map")

   <b>Remote</b> <b>syntax</b> <b>check</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>debugging</b>
       If you developing on a remote machine, you can instruct the Perl::LanguageServer to run  on  that  remote
       machine, so the correct modules etc. are available for syntax check and debugger is started on the remote
       machine.  To do so set sshAddr and sshUser, preferably in your workspace configuration.

       Example:

           "sshAddr": "10.11.12.13",
           "sshUser": "root"

       Also set sshWorkspaceRoot, so the local workspace path can be mapped to the remote one.

       Example:  if  your  local  path  is  \10.11.12.13\share\path\to\ws  and  on  the  remote machine you have
       /path/to/ws

           "sshWorkspaceRoot": "/path/to/ws"

       The other possibility is to provide a pathMap. This allows one to having multiple mappings.

       Examples:

           "perl.pathMap": [
               ["remote uri", "local uri"],
               ["remote uri", "local uri"]
           ]

           "perl.pathMap": [
               [
               "file:///",
               "file:///home/systems/mountpoint/"
               ]
           ]

   <b>Syntax</b> <b>check</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>debugging</b> <b>inside</b> <b>a</b> <b>container</b>
       You can run the  LanguageServer  and/or  debugger  inside  a  container  by  setting  "containerCmd"  and
       "conatinerName".  There are more container options, see above.

       .vscode/settings.json

           {
               "perl": {
                   "enable": true,
                   "containerCmd": "docker",
                   "containerName": "perl_container",
               }
           }

       This  will  start the whole Perl::LanguageServer inside the container. This is espacally helpfull to make
       syntax check working, if there is a different setup inside and outside the container.

       In this case you need to tell the Perl::LanguageServer how  to  map  local  paths  to  paths  inside  the
       container. This is done by setting "perl.pathMap" (see above).

       Example:

           "perl.pathMap": [
               [
               "file:///path/inside/the/container",
               "file:///local/path/outside/the/container"
               ]
           ]

       It's  also  possible  to  run  the  LanguageServer outside the container and only the debugger inside the
       container. This is especially helpfull, when the container is not always running, while you are  editing.
       To  make  only  the  debugger  running  inside  the  container,  put  "containerCmd", "conatinerName" and
       "pasth_map" in your "launch.json".  You can have different setting for each debug session.

       Normaly the arguments for the "containerCmd" are  automatically  build.  In  case  you  want  to  use  an
       unsupported "containerCmd" you need to specifiy apropriate "containerArgs".

   <b>FAQ</b>
       <u>Working</u> <u>directory</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>defined</u>

       It  is  not  defined  what  the  current  working  directory  is  at  the  start  of  a perl program.  So
       Perl::LanguageServer makes no assumptions about it. To solve the problem you can set  the  directory  via
       cwd configuration parameter in launch.json for debugging.

       <u>Module</u> <u>not</u> <u>found</u> <u>when</u> <u>debugging</u> <u>or</u> <u>during</u> <u>syntax</u> <u>check</u>

       If  you  reference  a  module with a relative path or if you assume that the current working directory is
       part of the Perl search path, it will not work.  Instead set the perl include path to  a  fixed  absolute
       path. In your settings.json do something like:

               "perl.perlInc": [
                   "/path/a/lib",
                   "/path/b/lib",
                   "/path/c/lib",
               ],
       Include path works for syntax check and inside of debugger.
       C&lt;perl.perlInc&gt; should be an absolute path.

       <u>AnyEvent,</u> <u>Coro</u> <u>Warning</u> <u>during</u> <u>install</u>

       You  need  to  install  the  AnyEvent::IO  and  Coro. Just ignore the warning that it might not work. For
       Perl::LanguageServer it works fine.

       <u>'richterger.perl'</u> <u>failed:</u> <u>options.port</u> <u>should</u> <u>be</u> <u>&gt;=</u> <u>0</u> <u>and</u> <u>&lt;</u> <u>65536</u>

       Change port setting from string to integer

       <u>Error</u> <u>"Can't</u> <u>locate</u> <u>MODULE_NAME"</u>

       Please make sure the path to the module is in "perl.perlInc" setting and use absolute path names  in  the
       perlInc  settings  or make sure you are running in the expected directory by setting the "cwd" setting in
       the lauch.json.

       <u>ERROR:</u> <u>Unknown</u> <u>perlmethod</u> <u>rpcnotsetTraceNotification</u>

       This is not an issue, that just means that not all features of the debugging  protocol  are  implemented.
       Also it says ERROR, it's just a warning and you can safely ignore it.

       <u>The</u> <u>debugger</u> <u>sometimes</u> <u>stops</u> <u>at</u> <u>random</u> <u>places</u>

       Upgrade to Version 2.4.0

       <u>Message</u> <u>about</u> <u>Perl::LanguageServer</u> <u>has</u> <u>crashed</u> <u>5</u> <u>times</u>

       This  is  a  problem  when more than one instance of Perl::LanguageServer is running.  Upgrade to Version
       2.4.0 solves this problem.

       <u>The</u> <u>program</u> <u>I</u> <u>want</u> <u>to</u> <u>debug</u> <u>needs</u> <u>some</u> <u>input</u> <u>via</u> <u>stdin</u>

       You can read stdin from a  file  during  debugging.  To  do  so  add  the  following  parameter  to  your
       "launch.json":

       ""args": [ "&lt;", "/path/to/stdin.txt" ]"

       e.g.

       "{
           "type": "perl",
           "request": "launch",
           "name": "Perl-Debug",
           "program": "${workspaceFolder}/${relativeFile}",
           "stopOnEntry": true,
           "reloadModules": true,
           "env": {
               "REQUEST_METHOD": "POST",
               "CONTENT_TYPE": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
               "CONTENT_LENGTH": 34
           }
           "args": [ "&lt;", "/path/to/stdin.txt" ] }"

       <u>Carton</u> <u>support</u>

       If  you  are  using  L&lt;https://metacpan.org/pod/Carton&gt;  to manage dependencies, add the full path to the
       Carton "lib" dir to your workspace settings file at ".vscode/settings.json". For example:

       Linux

           {
             "perl.perlInc": ["/home/myusername/projects/myprojectname/local/lib/perl5"]
           }

       Mac

           {
             "perl.perlInc": ["/Users/myusername/projects/myprojectname/local/lib/perl5"]
           }

   <b>Known</b> <b>Issues</b>
       Does not yet work on windows, due to issues with reading from stdin.  I wasn't able to  find  a  reliable
       way to do a non-blocking read from stdin on windows.  I would be happy, if anyone knows how to do this in
       Perl.

       Anyway, Perl::LanguageServer runs without problems inside of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

           starting "Perl::LanguageServer" if another instance of "Perl::LanguageServer" is running on the  same
           machine (thanks to hakonhagland)

       •   Add configuration "debugAdapterPortRange", for choosing range of port for dynamic port assignment

       •   Add  support  for  using LanguageServer and debugger inside a Container.  Currently docker containers
           und containers running inside kubernetes are supported.

       •   When starting debugger session and "stopOnEntry" is false, do not switch to sourefile where  debugger
           would stop, when "stopOnEntry" is true.
