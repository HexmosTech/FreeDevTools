</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::xAP - A base class for protocols such as IMAP, ACAP, IMSP, and ICAP.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       "use Net::xAP;"

       <b>WARNING:</b> <b>This</b> <b>code</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>release.</b>  <b>Expect</b> <b>the</b> <b>interface</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>from</b> <b>release</b> <b>to</b> <b>release.</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This base class implements the substrate common across the IMAP, ACAP, IMSP, and ICAP protocols.  It
       provides the interface to the network calls and implements a small amount of glue to assist in
       implementing interfaces to this protocol family.

</pre><h4><b>END-PROGRAMMER</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods are potentially useful for end-programmers.

   <b>last_command_time</b>
       Return what time the most recent command was sent to the server.  The return value is a "time" integer.

   <b>connection</b>
       Returns the connection object being used by the object.

</pre><h4><b>PROTOCOL-DEVELOPER</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods are probably only useful to protocol developers.

   <b>new</b> <b>$host,</b> <b>$peerport</b> <b>[,</b> <b>%options]</b>
       Create a new instance of Net::xAP, connects to $host, and returns a reference to the object.

       The $host parameter is the name of the host to contact.  If $host starts with a "/" character, the
       parameter is assumed to contain the name of a program and the given program is spawned as a child
       process.  This is useful for driving programs that can be operated interactively from the command-line,
       such as UW-imapd.

       The $peerport parameter specifies the TCP port used for the network connection. The parameter should be
       in the syntax understood by "IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new".  This parameter is ignored if a child process is
       spawned.

       The %options parameter specifies any options to use.  The following list enumerates the options, and
       their default values, currently understood by "Net::xAP":

       "Synchronous =&gt; 1"
           Setting  this  option  causes  "Net::xAP"  to issue a "response" method immediately after sending the
           command  to  the  server.   Currently,  this  option  should  always  be  left  on.   Non-synchronous
           command/response processing has not been tested.

           One  down-side  to  Synchronous  mode  is  that  commands  cannot be sent to the server from within a
           callback.  Instead, the results should be saved, and the commands should be sent  after  the  current
           command has completed.

       "NonSyncLits =&gt; 0"
           Setting this option causes "Net::xAP" to use non-synchronizing literals.  This should only be enabled
           if the protocol and server this feature.

       "Debug =&gt; 0"
           Setting  this option causes debug output to be written to "stderr".  See the "debug_print" method for
           a description of the output format.

       "InternetDraft =&gt; 0"
           Setting this option adds support for various extensions that  are  still  in  Internet  Draft.   This
           option  is only intended to be used by protocol developers.  Most bug reports related to this feature
           will be ignored.

       All options are also passed to the internal call to "IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new", unless a child IMAP  process
       is spawned.

   <b>command</b> <b>$callback,</b> <b>$command</b> <b>[,</b> <b>@args]</b>
       The "command" is used to send commands to the server.

       The  $callback  parameter  should  be  a  reference to a subroutine. It will be called when a response is
       received from the server.

       @args is a list of $type-$value pairs.  The $type indicates what type of data type  to  use  for  $value.
       This is used to control the encoding necessary to pass the command arguments to the server.

       The following $types are understood:

       "ATOM"
           The data will sent raw to the server.

       "ASTRING"
           The  data  will  be  sent  to  the  server as an atom, a quoted string, or a literal depending on the
           content of $value.

       "PARENS"
           The data in $value will be  interpreted  as  an  array  reference  and  be  sent  inside  a  pair  of
           parentheses.

       "STRING"
           The  data will be sent to the server as either a quoted string or literal depending on the content of
           $value.

       "QSTRING"
           The data will be sent to the server as a quoted string.

       If the "Synchronous" option is set this method will return a response object, otherwise  it  will  return
       the sequence number associated with the command just sent to the server.

   <b>parse_fields</b> <b>$str</b>
       Splits  the  specified  $str  into  fields.   A list reference is returned contain the individual fields.
       Parenthetical clauses are represented as nested list references of arbitrary depth.  Quoted  strings  are
       stripped of their surrounding quotes and escaped "\\" and "\"" characters are unescaped.

   <b>response</b>
       Reads response lines from the server until one of the lines is a completion response.  For each response,
       the appropriate callbacks are triggered.  This is automatically called if the "Synchronous" option is on.

   <b>getline</b>
       Get one 'line' of data from the server, including any literal payloads.

   <b>close_connection</b>
       Closes the connection to the server, returning the results of the operation.

   <b>sequence</b>
       Returns the sequence number of the last command issued to the server.

   <b>next_sequence</b>
       Returns the sequence number that will be assigned to the next command issued.

   <b>pending</b>
       Returns  a list of sequence numbers for the commands that are still awaiting a complete response from the
       server.

       The list is sorted numerically.

   <b>debug</b> <b>[$boolean]</b>
       Returns the value of the debug option for the object.

       If $boolean is specified, the debug state is set to the given value.

   <b>debug_print</b> <b>$direction,</b> <b>$text</b>
       Prints $text to "STDERR", preceded by an indication of traffic direction, the  object  reference,  and  a
       timestamp. The parameter $direction is used to indicate the direction of the traffic related to the debug
       call.  Use 0 for data being sent to the server, or 1 for data coming from the server.

   <b>debug_text</b> <b>$text</b>
       A  stub  method intended to be overridden by subclasses.  It provides subclasses with the ability to make
       alterations to $text before being output by  "debug_print"  method.   The  base  class  version  does  no
       alteration of $text.

</pre><h4><b>RESPONSE</b> <b>OBJECTS</b></h4><pre>
       A  response  object  is  the data type returned by the "response" method.  A few convenience routines are
       provided at the Net::xAP level that are likely to be common across several protocols.

   <b>new</b>
       Creates a new response object.

   <b>tag</b>
       Returns the tag associated with the response object.

   <b>status</b>
       Returns the command status associated with the response object.  This will be "OK", "NO", or "BAD".

   <b>text</b>
       Returns the human readable text associated with the status of the response object.

       This will typically be overridden by a subclass of the "xAP" class to handle things like status codes.

   <b>status_code</b>
       Returns a list reference containing the response code portion of the server response.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       With only a few exceptions, the methods provided in this class are intended for use by developers  adding
       support for additional protocols.  Don't muck with this level, unless you know what you're doing.
