       Carton::Doc::Install - Install the dependencies

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         carton install [--deployment] [--cached] [--path=PATH] [--without develop]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Install the dependencies for your application. This command has two modes and the behavior is slightly
       different.

   <b>DEVELOPMENT</b> <b>MODE</b>
       carton install
           If  you  run  "carton  install"  without  any  arguments  and  if  <u>cpanfile</u>  exists, carton will scan
           dependencies from <u>cpanfile</u> and install the modules.

       If you run "carton install" for the first time (i.e. <u>cpanfile.snapshot</u> does not exist), carton will fetch
       all the modules specified, resolve dependencies and install all required modules from CPAN.

       If <u>cpanfile.snapshot</u> file does exist, carton will still try to install modules specified  or  updated  in
       <u>cpanfile</u>, but uses <u>cpanfile.snapshot</u> for the dependency resolution, and then cascades to CPAN.

       carton  will  analyze  all  the  dependencies  and  their  version  information,  and  it  is  saved into
       <u>cpanfile.snapshot</u> file. It  is  important  to  add  <u>cpanfile.snapshot</u>  file  into  a  version  controlled
       repository and commit the changes as you update your dependencies.

   <b>DEPLOYMENT</b> <b>MODE</b>
       If  you  specify the "--deployment" command line option or the <u>cpanfile.snapshot</u> exists, carton will only
       use the dependencies specified in the <u>cpanfile.snapshot</u> instead of resolving dependencies.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --deployment
           Force the deployment mode. See "DEPLOYMENT MODE" above.

       --cached
           Locate distribution tarballs in "vendor/cache" rather than fetching  them  from  CPAN  mirrors.  This
           requires  you  to  run  "carton  bundle"  prior  to  the deployment and commit or sync the content of
           "vendor" directory to the other host you run "carton install" on.

       --cpanfile
           Specify the alternate path for cpanfile.  By  default,  "carton  install"  will  look  for  the  file
           "cpanfile"  in  the current directory, then upwards till the root directory, in case the command runs
           from a sub directory.

           Carton assumes the directory where your  cpanfile  (or  altenate  path)  exists  as  a  project  root
           directory,  and  will  look  for  the  snapshot  file  as  well  as  install  directory ("local") and
           "vendor/cache" relative to it.

       --path
           Specify the path to install modules to.  Defaults  to  <u>local</u>  in  the  directory  relative  to  where
           "cpanfile" is.

           <b>NOTE</b>:  this  option,  as of version 1.0, is not preserved across multiple runs of "carton install" or
           other commands such as  "carton  list"  or  "carton  exec".  You  can  choose  to  set  the  path  in
           "PERL_CARTON_PATH" environment variable to persist it across commands.

       --without
           By  default,  "carton install" will install all the phases for dependencies, including "develop". You
           can specify phases or features to exclude, in the comma separated list.

             carton install --deployment --without develop

           <b>NOTE</b>: "--without" for the initial installation (without cpanfile.snapshot) is not supported  at  this
           moment.
