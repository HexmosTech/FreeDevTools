       Module::Install::Philosophy - The concepts behind Module::Install

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes the personal philosophy behind the creation of <b>CPAN::MakeMaker</b> (the predecessor
       of <b>Module::Install</b>).  The views expressed here belong to Brian Ingerson; if they are not of interest to
       you, you can safely ignore this document.

</pre><h4><b>I</b> <b>HAVE</b> <b>A</b> <b>DREAM</b></h4><pre>
       I say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment, I still
       have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the Perl Module dream.

       I have a dream that one day this community will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We
       hold these truths to be self-evident: that all Perl authors are created equal."

       I have a dream that one day even the state of the "CGI::" namespace, a desert state, sweltering with the
       heat of injustice and oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

       I have a dream that my four modules will one day live in an archive where they will not be judged by the
       number of their prerequisites but by the content of their source code.

       I have a dream today.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The above is obviously a mutation of the monumental speech by great Martin Luther King
       (&lt;<a href="http://web66.coled.umn.edu/new/MLK/MLK.html">http://web66.coled.umn.edu/new/MLK/MLK.html</a>&gt;).  While the contexts are vastly different, I feel that
       there are some serious parallelisms.

       The CPAN has become a place that is not free of injustice. This situation has arisen not out of directed
       oppression, but from a failure of our community to keep its tools sharp. It is the culmination of many
       small decisions made in the name of practicality. This is a sad state for an institution that was created
       to allow all interested people to contribute equally to the best of their ability.

       This assertion is rooted in my personal experience as an author. When I created my first Perl module,
       Inline.pm, I knew that I had done something important. But how was I to make a dent in vast Perl
       community?

       As a complete unknown in the Perl community, my voice did not travel far. I repeatedly tried to get even
       an acknowledgment from the gurus familiar with XS. No success. I resorted to sending messages with
       ridiculous subjects to "<a href="mailto:modules@perl.org">modules@perl.org</a>".
       (&lt;<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2000-08/msg00078.html">http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2000-08/msg00078.html</a>&gt;) No response. Through sheer
       determination and shameless self-promotion I eventually got the word out, and I hope the world is a
       slightly better place for it.

       Since then, Inline has won awards and I have had the privilege to meet almost all of Perl's finest. But I
       still remember the pain of starting out, and want to help invite more people into this wonderful world.

       One thing I have learned from experience is that the Perl community (and throw in the Python and Ruby
       people as well) is a small drop in the vast ocean of programming. It's a giant pot of Java out there; and
       a sea of C. Perl may not be the biggest fish, but with some care and cunning we could become a much
       bigger school.

       These are the current problems that I see with CPAN and the core modules:

       •   New Modules don't help Older Perls

           If  I  were to guess what percent of all Perl5 installations were at the current release level (5.8.0
           in October 2002) I would say 3-5%. That may even be generous. I'd say that over 40% of  installations
           might still be at 5.005 or earlier.

           The  biggest  problem  with  adding a module to the core is that it only helps a small subset of Perl
           users for a long long time. Worse yet, a good module author will still probably avoid using the  core
           additions as prerequisites, because they want their new module to work as well on 5.005 as on 5.8.

           CPAN::MakeMaker should be able to help in this regard. For example, instead of putting Inline.pm into
           the  core  for  5.9, I can now effectively get it into the core for every version of Perl that Inline
           supports.

       •   Author Exclusiveness

           Not just anybody can get a module into the core. It seems you have to know people in high places.  If
           I were a brilliant new talent with a great new module, it would have a harder time getting the ear of
           the  pumpking,  then  if  I were, say, Damian Conway. In fact, I probably wouldn't even know where to
           start.

       •   Reduced Competition

           One comment I've heard from some very good Perl programmers is "Everything important has already been
           done". Their feeling is that even though a module is suboptimal, it would be a waste of time to write
           a competing module. Who would use it instead of the one already in the core?

           When I write a competing module, I know that I have to make it at least twice as good as the existing
           one to even get noticed. That's not a bad thing, but should everybody be forced into that situation?

           For example, let's say that you have created a really useful CGI script.   Let's  also  say  that  it
           makes  use  of your own <b>CGI::Special</b> module, because <b>CGI.pm</b> doesn't meet your needs. Even though your
           script might be generally useful and worth sharing, the fact that it requires a  non-standard  module
           can  only  negatively  affect  its  acceptance.  Trying  to  get  general acceptance for the superior
           <b>CGI::Special</b> module will be harder still.

           Core modules are assumed by the general public to be "Best of Breed".  While this  may  be  true  for
           some  modules  at  some  point in time, it keeps talented people from attempting to "breed" something
           better.

       •   Core Bloat

           Every time we add a module to the core it gets bigger and bigger. And we can't  ever  remove  modules
           from the core, once they've been added.

           If I had my druthers, we'd remove all modules from the core that weren't necessary for either running
           Perl  or  installing modules. Of course, we'd need to set things up so that installing modules was so
           easy, that it could be done on the fly if necessary. Is this  easily  accomplishable?   Nope.  Is  it
           impossible? Nope. We have the best language in the world to help us do it!

       •   Maintenance Bitrot

           Believe  it or not, Perl authors can sometimes acquire a "Life Beyond Perl". They get families or new
           hobbies or even hit by a bus. (This would be a "Death Beyond Perl".) The fact is, that once  somebody
           writes a piece of code and shares it with the world, they are expected to maintain it for all time.

           That is being generous. There are others that think that once their module has become popular or made
           it  into  the core, they don't need to keep fixing and improving it. I have personally been guilty of
           this sin.

           And then there's the Damian Conway Effect. This plagues the exceptional authors who are so innovative
           and prolific they simply don't have time to maintain everything they have written.

       I initially formalized these opinions at the YAPC (Yet Another Perl Conference) in June 2001. Since  then
       I have been trying to think of technological solutions to fix these social problems.

       One idea was dubbed NAPC. NAPC is CPAN backwards. It is a large system of precompiled modules that can be
       installed  on  the  fly,  with  the  goal  of reducing the number of modules in the core. NAPC hasn't got
       started yet. I'd still like to do it someday, but it's a big problem with a lot of issues.

       <b>CPAN::MakeMaker</b> (and now <b>Module::Install</b>) on the other hand,  is  simple  and  ultimately  flexible.   It
       should  work  with  all  of  the existing CPAN processes without requiring any changes from them. And new
       features can be continuously added. Even though it doesn't scratch all of my philosophical  CPAN  itches,
       it's a good start.
