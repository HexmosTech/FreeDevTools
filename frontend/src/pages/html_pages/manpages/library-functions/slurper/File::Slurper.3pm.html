</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::Slurper - A simple, sane and efficient module to slurp a file

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.014

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use File::Slurper 'read_text';
        my $content = read_text($filename);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides functions for fast and correct slurping and spewing. All functions are optionally
       exported. All functions throw exceptions on errors, write functions don't return any meaningful value.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>read_text($filename,</b> <b>$encoding,</b> <b>$crlf)</b>
       Reads file $filename into a scalar and decodes it from $encoding (which defaults to UTF-8). If $crlf is
       true, crlf translation is performed. The default for this argument is off. The special value 'auto' will
       set it to a platform specific default value.

   <b>read_binary($filename)</b>
       Reads file $filename into a scalar without any decoding or transformation.

   <b>read_lines($filename,</b> <b>$encoding,</b> <b>$crlf,</b> <b>$skip_chomp)</b>
       Reads file $filename into a list/array line-by-line, after decoding from $encoding, optional crlf
       translation and chomping. It will always use newline as separator.

   <b>write_text($filename,</b> <b>$content,</b> <b>$encoding,</b> <b>$crlf)</b>
       Writes $content to file $filename, encoding it to $encoding (which defaults to UTF-8). It can also take a
       "crlf" argument that works exactly as in read_text.

   <b>write_binary($filename,</b> <b>$content)</b>
       Writes $content to file $filename as binary data.

   <b>read_dir($dirname)</b>
       Open "dirname" and return all entries except "." and "..".

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       This module tries to make it as easy as possible to read and write files correctly and fast. The most
       correct way of doing this is not always obvious (e.g. #83126
       &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=83126&gt;), and just as often the most obvious correct way
       is not the fastest correct way. This module hides away all such complications behind an easy intuitive
       interface.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       This module has an optional dependency on PerlIO::utf8_strict. Installing this will make UTF-8 encoded IO
       significantly faster, but should not otherwise affect the operation of this module. This may change into
       a dependency on the related Unicode::UTF8 in the future.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       •   Path::Tiny

           A minimalistic abstraction handling not only IO but also paths.

       •   IO::All

           An attempt to expose as many IO related features as possible via a single API.

       •   File::Slurp

           This  is  a  previous  generation  file slurping module. It has a number of issues, as described here
           &lt;<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/leon_timmermans/2015/08/fileslurp-is-broken-and-wrong.html">http://blogs.perl.org/users/leon_timmermans/2015/08/fileslurp-is-broken-and-wrong.html</a>&gt;.

       •   File::Slurp::Tiny

           This was my previous attempt at a better file slurping module. It's mostly (but not entirely) a drop-
           in replacement for File::Slurp, which is both a  feature  (easy  conversion)  and  a  bug  (interface
           issues).

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       •   "open_text"/"open_binary"?

       •   "drain_handle"?
