</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       LiveJournal - A Perl implementation of the LiveJournal protocol

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use LiveJournal;

        my %info = (
               user =&gt; 'foo',
               password =&gt; 'bar',
        );

        my $lj = LiveJournal-&gt;new(\%info);

        my $response = $lj-&gt;login();

        print "Logged in successfully\n" if ($response-&gt;{success} eq "OK");

        ...

        my $friend = LiveJournal::Friend-&gt;new();

        my $response = $friend-&gt;check();

        ...

        my $journal = LiveJournal::Journal-&gt;new();

        my $response = $journal-&gt;syncitems();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is implements the LiveJournal protocol.  See
       <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/developer/protocol.bml">http://www.livejournal.com/developer/protocol.bml</a> for details.  Data is requested from the server through
       <u>mode</u> <u>lines</u>.  Many methods return a hash reference containing key/value pairs returned by the server.
       Descriptions of possible responses can be found at <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/developer/modelist.bml">http://www.livejournal.com/developer/modelist.bml</a>

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       new (INFO)
           This  is the constructor for a new LiveJournal object.  "INFO" is a hash containing at least <u>username</u>
           and <u>password</u> (plaintext) or <u>hpassword</u> (MD5 hash) key/value pairs.  You may also include  a  <u>URL</u>,  for
           which the default is <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/cgi-bin/log.cgi">http://www.livejournal.com/cgi-bin/log.cgi</a>.  To use a proxy, add a <u>proxy</u> key and
           value.

       LiveJournal::livejournal-&gt;new([ FILES ])
           If  you  want  to  use a file in the livejournalrc format to store your data, you can use this method
           instead.  "FILES" is an array reference to the file(s) you want to load.  If you don't  specify  any,
           it  will use the first one found of <a href="file:~/.livejournalrc">~/.livejournalrc</a>, <a href="file:~/.livejournal.rc">~/.livejournal.rc</a>, or /etc/livejournalrc.  This
           will return an object in the LiveJournal class.

</pre><h4><b>BASE</b> <b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       login ([ INFO ])
           Log in to the LiveJournal server.  Returns a hash reference.  The server returns whether the password
           is good or not, the user's name, an optional message to be displayed to the user, and the list of the
           user's friend groups.  "INFO" is an optional hash reference containing the  optional  keys  <b>getmoods</b>,
           <b>getmenus</b>, and <b>getpickws</b>.

           <b>getmoods</b>  should  exist and be the number of the highest mood ID you have cached/stored on the user's
           computer. For example, if you logged in last time with and got mood IDs 1, 2, 4, and 5, then send "5"
           as the value of "getmoods". The server will return every new mood that has an internal MoodID greater
           than 5. If you've never downloaded moods before, send "0".

           <b>getmenus</b> should exist if you want to get a list/tree of web jump menus to show in your client.

           <b>getpickws</b> should exist if you want to receive that list of picture keywords.

       user ()
           Returns the username

       password ()
           Returns the password or hpassword, whichever is set.

       version ([VERSION])
           Returns the version string.  You may alter the version string by passing a "VERSION".

       access ([ INFO ])
           Sets/returns the journals that the  user  has  the  ability  to  post  to.   This  method  is  called
           automatically by "parse_login()".  It returns a list reference containing each journal.

       friend_group ([ INFO ])
           Sets/returns  the  friend group information.  This method is called automatically by "parse_login()".
           It returns a hash of hashes containing <b>name</b> and <b>sortorder</b> key/value pairs.  We use a hash instead  of
           an  array  here  because the group numbers start from 1 and it seemed more appropriate than having an
           undef 0 element or requiring adding 1 all the time.

       friend_group_max ([ MAX ])
           Sets/returns  the  maximum  friend_group  number.    This   method   is   called   automatically   by
           "parse_login()".

       menu ([ INFO ])
           Sets/returns   the   menu  text  and  URL  information.   This  method  is  called  automatically  by
           "parse_login()".  You can use the list of lists of hashes it returns as data for menus.

       mood ([ INFO ])
           Sets/returns the mood information.  This method is called automatically by "parse_login()".   Returns
           a list of hashes containing the keys <b>id</b> and <b>name</b> for each mood.

       mood_count ([ COUNT ])
           Sets/returns the number of moods.  This method is called automatically by "parse_login()".

       name ([ NAME ])
           Sets/returns  the  name  of  the  the  logged  in  user.   This  method  is  called  automatically by
           "parse_login()".

       pic_keyword ([ KEYWORDS ])
           Sets/returns the picture keywords.  This method is called automatically by "parse_login()".   Returns
           a reference to a list of the keywords.

       escape (STRING)
           Use this method to escape strings.  "STRING" is any string.  All non-alphanumeric characters and non-
           whitespace are converted to their %hex values.  Spaces are converted to <b>+</b>s.

</pre><h4><b>FRIEND</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       check ()
           Poll  the server to see if the friends list has been updated. This request is extremely quick, and is
           the preferred way for users to see when their friends list is updated.  Returns a hash reference.

       get ([ [ FRIENDOF ] [, GROUPS ] ])
           Takes two optional arguments.  If "FRIENDOF" is set to 1, you will also get back the  info  from  the
           "friendof"  mode.   If  "GROUPS"  is set to 1, you will get the info from the "getfriendgroups" mode.
           This method returns a hash reference which should be passed to <b>parse()</b> to be more useful.  <b>YOU</b> <b>SHOULD</b>
           <b>ALWAYS</b> <b>USE</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>METHOD</b> <b>BEFORE</b> <b>VIEWING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>AFTER</b> <b>MODIFYING</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>FRIENDS</b> <b>LIST</b> <b>TO</b> <b>AVOID</b> <b>INCONSISTENCIES.</b>

       parse (FRIENDS)
           Takes one argument: the hash reference returned from <b>get()</b>.   Returns  a  hash  of  lists  of  hashes
           containing the info (user, name, fg, bg, etc) for each friend such as:

           'friend' =&gt;
               [
                  {
                   'fg'        =&gt; '#000000',
                   'bg'        =&gt; '#FFFFFF',
                   'groupmask' =&gt; '3',
                   'user'      =&gt; 'SomeUser',
                   'name'      =&gt; 'Some X. Name'
                  }
               ]

           You should call <b>parse()</b> anytime you call <b>get()</b> to keep your friend count up to date.

       edit (FRIENDS)
           This method is used to add and edit friends to your friends list.  It takes a hash of hash references
           structure  which  has the <b>username</b> as the first level of keys.  The second level contains optional <b>fg</b>
           and <b>bg</b> colors in #RRGGBB format.

           'newfriend' =&gt;
              {
               'fg' =&gt; '#000000',
               'bg' =&gt; '#FFFFFF',
              }

           <b>newfriend</b> is the name of the new user.  <b>number</b> should be the sum of "numfriends() +  n"  where  n  is
           incremented for each friend you are adding.

       add (FRIEND, [ FG [, BG ] ])
           Use  this  method  to  add a user from your friends list.  "FRIEND" is a username.  "FG" and "BG" are
           foreground and background values in #RRGGBB format.

       remove (USERS)
           Use this method to remove users from your friends  list.   Pass  it  an  array  reference  containing
           usernames.  Returns a hash reference.

       friendof ()
           This method returns a hash reference of the users that list you as a friend.  This hash reference can
           be passed to <b>parse()</b>.

       lastupdate ([ LAST ])
           Returns or sets the last time <b>check</b> was used.  <b>check()</b> sets this value so you don't have to.

       numfriends ([ NUMBER ])
           This method sets and returns the number of friends you have.  It is automatically called from <b>parse()</b>
           so you shouldn't have to worry about setting it manually.

       friends ()
           Sets  and  returns  your friends list.  This method is called by "parse()" automatically to propagate
           the hash.

       getgroups ()
           This method returns a hash reference containing information about your friend groups

       editgroups (INFO)
           Use this method to create or edit a friend group.  You can modify the name, sort  order,  and  public
           attributes  of  the  group  by passing a hashref containing the keys called <b>name</b>, <b>sort</b>, or <b>public</b> and
           respective new values.  You can also add a friend to a group or groups by passing their username as a
           key and the new groupmask as a value.

       deletegroups (NUMBERS)
           This method deletes a friend group.  Pass it an array reference containing the numbers of the  groups
           to delete.

       friends_by_group ()
           Returns a hash of list references containing users and the groups they are members of.

       add_friend_to_group (USER, GROUP)
           Use this method to add a friend to a user group.  "USER" is the username of the person and "GROUP" is
           the group number.

       remove_friend_from_group (USER, GROUP)
           Use  this  method  to  remove  a  friend from a user group.  "USER" is the username of the person and
           "GROUP" is the group number.

</pre><h4><b>JOURNAL</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       get (INFO)
           Use this method to download parts of a user's journal.  "INFO" is  a  hash  reference  containing  at
           least a key called <b>selecttype</b> and a value of either <b>syncitems</b>, <b>day</b>, <b>lastn</b>, or <b>one</b>.

           <b>syncitems</b>  will  use  the  "lastcync()" method by default, otherwise pass it a date in the <u>yyyy-mm-dd</u>
           <u>hh::mm::ss</u> format.

           If you use <b>day</b>, you may provide <b>year</b>, <b>month</b>, and <b>day</b> keys to specify which day.  Default is today.

           The <b>lastn</b> value requires a <b>howmany</b> key which says how many of the  most  recent  items  to  download.
           Maximum is 50.  Default is 20.

           If  you  want  a  particular  entry,  you  should  use  the  <b>one</b> value and a complimentary <b>itemid</b> key
           containing the id of the item you want to grab.

           For further detail, see <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/developer/modeinfo.bml">http://www.livejournal.com/developer/modeinfo.bml</a>?getevents

       post (INFO)
           This method is used to post a journal entry.  "INFO" is a hash reference containing at least an <b>event</b>
           key with a value of the post content.  The date keys are created for you.

           For further detail, see <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/developer/modeinfo.bml">http://www.livejournal.com/developer/modeinfo.bml</a>?postevent

       edit (INFO)
           Used to edit user's past journal entry.  "INFO" is a a hash reference containing at least the  <u>itemid</u>
           and     <u>event</u>     being     submitted.      Other     optional     values     are    documented    at
           <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/developer/modeinfo.bml">http://www.livejournal.com/developer/modeinfo.bml</a>?editevent

       remove (ITEMID)
           Used to delete a past journal entry.  "ITEMID" is a scalar containing the unique item id to delete.

       syncitems ()
           Returns a hash reference containing items (journal entries, to-do items,  comments)  that  have  been
           created or updated on LiveJournal since you last downloaded them.

       lastsync ([ LAST ])
           Returns  or  sets  the last time <b>syncitems()</b> was used.  <b>syncitems()</b> sets this value so you don't have
           to.

       getdaycounts ()
           This mode retrieves the number of journal entries per day. Useful for populating calendar widgets  in
           GUI clients.
