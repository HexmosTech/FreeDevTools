</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       UR::Context::Process - Implements a generic interface to the current application.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         $name = UR::Context::Process-&gt;base_name;

         $name = UR::Context::Process-&gt;prog_name;
         UR::Context::Process-&gt;prog_name($name);

         $name = UR::Context::Process-&gt;pkg_name;
         UR::Context::Process-&gt;pkg_name($name);

         $name = UR::Context::Process-&gt;title;
         UR::Context::Process-&gt;title($name);

         $version = UR::Context::Process-&gt;version;
         UR::Context::Process-&gt;version($version);

         $author = UR::Context::Process-&gt;author;
         UR::Context::Process-&gt;author($author);

         $author_email = UR::Context::Process-&gt;author_email;
         UR::Context::Process-&gt;author_email($author_email);

         $support_email = UR::Context::Process-&gt;support_email;

         $login = UR::Context::Process-&gt;real_user_name;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides methods to set and retrieve various names associated with the program and the
       program version number.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       These methods provide the accessor and set methods for various names associated with an application.

       get_current
            $ctx = UR::Context::Process-&gt;get_current();

           This is the context which represents the current process.

           Also available as UR::Context-&gt;<b>get_process()</b>;

       <b>has_changes()</b>
            $bool = UR::Context::Process-&gt;has_changes();

           Returns  true  if  the  current  process  has changes which might be committed back to the underlying
           context.

       _create_for_current_process
            $ctx = UR::Context::Process-&gt;_create_for_current_process(@PARAMS)

           This is only used internally by UR.  It materializes  a  new  object  to  represent  a  real  process
           somewhere.

           TODO:  Remove  the exception from <b>create()</b>, and allow other processes to be created explicitly w/ the
           appropriate characteristics.

       base_name
             $name = UR::Context::Process-&gt;base_name;

           This is "basename($0, '.pl'))".

       prog_name
             $name = UR::Context::Process-&gt;prog_name;
             UR::Context::Process-&gt;prog_name($name);

           This method is used to access and set the name of the program name.

           This name is used in the output of the "version" and "usage" subroutines (see "version" and "usage").
           If given an argument, this method sets the program name and  returns  the  new  name  or  "undef"  if
           unsuccessful.

           It defaults to "basename" if unspecified.

       pkg_name
             $name = UR::Context::Process-&gt;pkg_name;
             UR::Context::Process-&gt;pkg_name($name);

           This  method  is  used  to access and set the GNU-standard package name for the package to which this
           program belongs.  This is does <b>NOT</b> refer-to a Perl package.  It allows a set of specific programs  to
           be grouped together under a common name, which is used in standard message output, and is used in the
           output of the "version" subroutine (see "version" output.

           If  given  an  argument, this method sets the package name and returns the the new name or "undef" if
           unsuccessful.  Without an argument, the current package name is returned.

           It defaults to "prog_name" when unspecified, which in turn defaults to  "base_name",  which  in  turn
           defaults to basename($0).

       title
             $name = UR::Context::Process-&gt;title;
             UR::Context::Process-&gt;title($name);

           This  gets and sets the "friendly name" for an application.  It is often mixed-case, with spaces, and
           is used in autogenerated documentation, and sometimes as a header in generic GUI components.  Without
           an argument, it returns the current title.  If  an  argument  is  specified,  this  method  sets  the
           application title and returns the new title or "undef" if unsuccessful.

           It  defaults  to  "pkg_name"  when  otherwise unspecified, which in turn defaults to "prog_name" when
           unspecified, which in turn defaults to "base_name" when unspecified, which defaults  to  basename($0)
           when unspecified.

       version
             $version = UR::Context::Process-&gt;version;
             UR::Context::Process-&gt;version($version);

           This method is used to access and set the package version.  This version is used in the output of the
           "print_version"  method (see "print_version" in App::Getopt).  If given an argument, this method sets
           the package version and returns the version or "undef" if unsuccessful.   Without  an  argument,  the
           current package version is returned.

           This message defaults to $main::VERSION if not set.  Note that $main::VERSION may be "undef".

       author
             $author = UR::Context::Process-&gt;author;
             UR::Context::Process-&gt;author($author);

           This method is used to access and set the package author.  If given an argument, this method sets the
           package  author  and returns the author or "undef" if unsuccessful.  Without an argument, the current
           author is returned.

       author_email
             $author_email = UR::Context::Process-&gt;author_email;
             UR::Context::Process-&gt;author_email($author_email);

           This method is used to access and set the package author's email address.  This information  is  used
           in  the output of the "usage" method (see "usage" in App::Getopt).  If given an argument, this method
           sets the package author's email address  and  returns  email  address  or  "undef"  if  unsuccessful.
           Without an argument, the current email address is returned.

       support_email
             $support_email = UR::Context::Process-&gt;support_email;
             UR::Context::Process-&gt;support_email($support_email);

           This  method  is  used  to  access and set the email address to which the user should go for support.
           This information is used in the output of the "usage" method (see "usage" in App::Getopt).  If  given
           an  argument, this method sets the support email address and returns that email address or "undef" if
           unsuccessful.  Without an argument, the current email address is returned.

       real_user_name
             $login = UR::Context::Process-&gt;real_user_name;

           This method is used to get the login name of the effective user id of the running script.

       fork $pid = UR::Context::Process-&gt;fork;
           Safe <b>fork()</b> wrapper.

           Handles properly disconnecting database handles if necessary so that data  sources  in  children  are
           still valid.  Also ensures that the active UR::Context::process has the child's PID recorded within.

       effective_user_name
             $login = UR::Context::Process-&gt;effective_user_name;

           This method is used to get the login name of the effective user id of the running script.

       original_program_path
            $path = UR::Context::Process-&gt;original_program_path;

           This  method  is used to (try to) get the original program path of the running script.  This will not
           change even if the current working directory is changed.  (In truth it will find the path at the time
           UR::Context::Process was used.  So, a chdir before that happens will cause incorrect results; in that
           case, undef will be returned.
