</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Mouse::Meta::Attribute - The Mouse attribute metaclass

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Mouse version v2.5.11

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a meta object protocol for Mouse attributes, which is a subset of Moose::Meta::Attribute.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"new(%options)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>Mouse::Meta::Attribute"</b>
       Instantiates a new Mouse::Meta::Attribute. Does nothing else.

       It adds the following options to the constructor:

       "is =&gt; 'ro', 'rw', 'bare'"
           This  provides  a  shorthand  for  specifying  the  "reader",  "writer",  or "accessor" names. If the
           attribute is read-only ('ro') then it will have a "reader" method with  the  same  attribute  as  the
           name.

           If  it is read-write ('rw') then it will have an "accessor" method with the same name. If you provide
           an explicit "writer" for a read-write attribute, then you will have a "reader" with the same name  as
           the attribute, and a "writer" with the name you provided.

           Use  'bare'  when you are deliberately not installing any methods (accessor, reader, etc.) associated
           with this attribute; otherwise, Moose will issue a deprecation warning when this attribute  is  added
           to a metaclass.

       "isa =&gt; Type"
           This  option  accepts a type. The type can be a string, which should be a type name. If the type name
           is unknown, it is assumed to be a class name.

           This option can also accept a Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object.

           If you <u>also</u> provide a "does" option, then your "isa" option must be a class name, and that class must
           do the role specified with "does".

       "does =&gt; Role"
           This is short-hand for saying that the attribute's type must be an object which does the named role.

           <b>This</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>supported.</b>

       "coerce =&gt; Bool"
           This option is only valid for objects with a type constraint ("isa"). If this is true, then coercions
           will be applied whenever this attribute is set.

           You can make both this and the "weak_ref" option true.

       "trigger =&gt; CodeRef"
           This option accepts a subroutine reference, which will be called after the attribute is set.

       "required =&gt; Bool"
           An attribute which is required must be provided to the constructor. An attribute  which  is  required
           can also have a "default" or "builder", which will satisfy its required-ness.

           A required attribute must have a "default", "builder" or a non-"undef" "init_arg"

       "lazy =&gt; Bool"
           A  lazy  attribute  must  have a "default" or "builder". When an attribute is lazy, the default value
           will not be calculated until the attribute is read.

       "weak_ref =&gt; Bool"
           If this is true, the attribute's value will be stored as a weak reference.

       "auto_deref =&gt; Bool"
           If this is true, then the reader will dereference the value when it is  called.  The  attribute  must
           have a type constraint which defines the attribute as an array or hash reference.

       "lazy_build =&gt; Bool"
           Setting this to true makes the attribute lazy and provides a number of default methods.

             has 'size' =&gt; (
                 is         =&gt; 'ro',
                 lazy_build =&gt; 1,
             );

           is equivalent to this:

             has 'size' =&gt; (
                 is        =&gt; 'ro',
                 lazy      =&gt; 1,
                 builder   =&gt; '_build_size',
                 clearer   =&gt; 'clear_size',
                 predicate =&gt; 'has_size',
             );

   <b>associate_method(MethodName)</b>
       Associates  a method with the attribute. Typically, this is called internally when an attribute generates
       its accessors.

       Currently the argument <u>MethodName</u> is ignored in Mouse.

   <b>"verify_against_type_constraint(Item)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>TRUE</b> <b>|</b> <b>ERROR"</b>
       Checks that the given value passes this attribute's type constraint. Returns "true" on success, otherwise
       "confess"es.

   <b>"clone_and_inherit_options(options)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>Mouse::Meta::Attribute"</b>
       Creates a new attribute in the owner class, inheriting options from parent classes.  Accessors and helper
       methods are installed. Some error checking is done.

   <b>"get_read_method_ref"</b>
   <b>"get_write_method_ref"</b>
       Returns the subroutine reference of a method suitable for reading or writing the attribute's value in the
       associated class. These methods always return a subroutine reference, regardless of whether  or  not  the
       attribute is read- or write-only.
