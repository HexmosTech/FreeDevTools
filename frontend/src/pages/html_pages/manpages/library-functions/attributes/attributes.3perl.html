</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       attributes - get/set subroutine or variable attributes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         sub foo : method ;
         my ($x,@y,%z) : Bent = 1;
         my $s = sub : method { ... };

         use attributes ();    # optional, to get subroutine declarations
         my @attrlist = attributes::get(\&amp;foo);

         use attributes 'get'; # import the attributes::get subroutine
         my @attrlist = get \&amp;foo;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Subroutine declarations and definitions may optionally have attribute lists associated with them.
       (Variable "my" declarations also may, but see the warning below.)  Perl handles these declarations by
       passing some information about the call site and the thing being declared along with the attribute list
       to this module.  In particular, the first example above is equivalent to the following:

           use attributes __PACKAGE__, \&amp;foo, 'method';

       The second example in the synopsis does something equivalent to this:

           use attributes ();
           my ($x,@y,%z);
           attributes::-&gt;import(__PACKAGE__, \$x, 'Bent');
           attributes::-&gt;import(__PACKAGE__, \@y, 'Bent');
           attributes::-&gt;import(__PACKAGE__, \%z, 'Bent');
           ($x,@y,%z) = 1;

       Yes, that's a lot of expansion.

       <b>WARNING</b>: attribute declarations for variables are still evolving.  The semantics and interfaces of such
       declarations could change in future versions.  They are present for purposes of experimentation with what
       the semantics ought to be.  Do not rely on the current implementation of this feature.

       There are only a few attributes currently handled by Perl itself (or directly by this module, depending
       on how you look at it.)  However, package-specific attributes are allowed by an extension mechanism.
       (See "Package-specific Attribute Handling" below.)

       The setting of subroutine attributes happens at compile time.  Variable attributes in "our" declarations
       are also applied at compile time.  However, "my" variables get their attributes applied at run-time.
       This means that you have to <u>reach</u> the run-time component of the "my" before those attributes will get
       applied.  For example:

           my $x : Bent = 42 if 0;

       will neither assign 42 to $x <u>nor</u> will it apply the "Bent" attribute to the variable.

       An attempt to set an unrecognized attribute is a fatal error.  (The error is trappable, but it still
       stops the compilation within that "eval".)  Setting an attribute with a name that's all lowercase letters
       that's not a built-in attribute (such as "foo") will result in a warning with <b>-w</b> or "use warnings
       'reserved'".

   <b>What</b> <b>"import"</b> <b>does</b>
       In the description it is mentioned that

         sub foo : method;

       is equivalent to

         use attributes __PACKAGE__, \&amp;foo, 'method';

       As you might know this calls the "import" function of "attributes" at compile time with these parameters:
       'attributes', the caller's package name, the reference to the code and 'method'.

         attributes-&gt;import( __PACKAGE__, \&amp;foo, 'method' );

       So you want to know what "import" actually does?

       First of all "import" gets the type of the third parameter ('CODE' in this case).  "attributes.pm" checks
       if there is a subroutine called "MODIFY_&lt;reftype&gt;_ATTRIBUTES" in the caller's namespace (here: 'main').
       In this case a subroutine "MODIFY_CODE_ATTRIBUTES" is required.  Then this method is called to check if
       you have used a "bad attribute".  The subroutine call in this example would look like

         MODIFY_CODE_ATTRIBUTES( 'main', \&amp;foo, 'method' );

       "MODIFY_&lt;reftype&gt;_ATTRIBUTES" has to return a list of all "bad attributes".  If there are any bad
       attributes "import" croaks.

       (See "Package-specific Attribute Handling" below.)

   <b>Built-in</b> <b>Attributes</b>
       The following are the built-in attributes for subroutines:

       lvalue
           Indicates  that  the  referenced subroutine is a valid lvalue and can be assigned to.  The subroutine
           must return a modifiable value such as a scalar variable, as described in perlsub.

           This module allows one to set this attribute on a subroutine  that  is  already  defined.   For  Perl
           subroutines  (XSUBs  are  fine), it may or may not do what you want, depending on the code inside the
           subroutine, with details subject to change in future Perl versions.  You may run into  problems  with
           lvalue  context  not being propagated properly into the subroutine, or maybe even assertion failures.
           For this reason, a warning is emitted if warnings are enabled.  In other words, you  should  only  do
           this if you really know what you are doing.  You have been warned.

       method
           Indicates  that  the  referenced subroutine is a method.  A subroutine so marked will not trigger the
           "Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s" warning.

       prototype(..)
           The "prototype" attribute is an alternate means of specifying a prototype  on  a  sub.   The  desired
           prototype is within the parens.

           The prototype from the attribute is assigned to the sub immediately after the prototype from the sub,
           which  means  that  if  both  are  declared  at the same time, the traditionally defined prototype is
           ignored.  In other words, "sub foo($$) : prototype(@) {}" is indistinguishable from "sub foo(@){}".

           If illegalproto warnings are enabled, the prototype declared inside this  attribute  will  be  sanity
           checked at compile time.

       const
           This  experimental  attribute,  introduced  in  Perl 5.22, only applies to anonymous subroutines.  It
           causes the subroutine to be called as soon as the "sub" expression is evaluated.  The return value is
           captured and turned into a constant subroutine.

       The following are the built-in attributes for variables:

       shared
           Indicates that the  referenced  variable  can  be  shared  across  different  threads  when  used  in
           conjunction with the threads and threads::shared modules.

   <b>Available</b> <b>Subroutines</b>
       The following subroutines are available for general use once this module has been loaded:

       get This  routine expects a single parameter--a reference to a subroutine or variable.  It returns a list
           of attributes, which may be empty.  If passed invalid arguments, it uses <b>die()</b> (via  Carp::croak)  to
           raise  a  fatal  exception.  If it can find an appropriate package name for a class method lookup, it
           will include the results from a "FETCH_<u>type</u>_ATTRIBUTES" call in its  return  list,  as  described  in
           "Package-specific Attribute Handling" below.  Otherwise, only built-in attributes will be returned.

       reftype
           This  routine  expects  a  single parameter--a reference to a subroutine or variable.  It returns the
           built-in type of the referenced variable, ignoring any package into which it might have been blessed.
           This can be useful for determining the <u>type</u> value which forms part of the method names  described  in
           "Package-specific Attribute Handling" below.

       Note that these routines are <u>not</u> exported by default.

   <b>Package-specific</b> <b>Attribute</b> <b>Handling</b>
       <b>WARNING</b>:   the   mechanisms  described  here  are  still  experimental.   Do  not  rely  on  the  current
       implementation.  In particular, there is no provision for applying package attributes to 'cloned'  copies
       of  subroutines  used  as  closures.   (See  "Making References" in perlref for information on closures.)
       Package-specific attribute handling may change incompatibly in a future release.

       When an attribute list is present in a declaration, a check is made to see whether an attribute  'modify'
       handler  is  present  in  the  appropriate  package  (or  its  @ISA  inheritance  tree).  Similarly, when
       "attributes::get" is called on a valid reference, a check is made for an  appropriate  attribute  'fetch'
       handler.  See "EXAMPLES" to see how the "appropriate package" determination works.

       The  handler  names  are  based on the underlying type of the variable being declared or of the reference
       passed.  Because  these  attributes  are  associated  with  subroutine  or  variable  declarations,  this
       deliberately  ignores any possibility of being blessed into some package.  Thus, a subroutine declaration
       uses "CODE" as its <u>type</u>, and even a blessed hash reference uses "HASH" as its <u>type</u>.

       The class methods invoked for modifying and fetching are these:

       FETCH_<u>type</u>_ATTRIBUTES
           This method is called with two arguments:  the relevant package name, and a reference to  a  variable
           or  subroutine for which package-defined attributes are desired.  The expected return value is a list
           of associated attributes.  This list may be empty.

       MODIFY_<u>type</u>_ATTRIBUTES
           This method is called with two fixed arguments, followed by the list of attributes from the  relevant
           declaration.   The  two fixed arguments are the relevant package name and a reference to the declared
           subroutine or variable.  The expected return value is a list of attributes which were not  recognized
           by this handler.  Note that this allows for a derived class to delegate a call to its base class, and
           then only examine the attributes which the base class didn't already handle for it.

           The  call  to this method is currently made <u>during</u> the processing of the declaration.  In particular,
           this means that a subroutine reference will probably be for an undefined  subroutine,  even  if  this
           declaration is actually part of the definition.

       Calling  attributes::get()  from  within  the  scope  of  a  null  package declaration "package ;" for an
       unblessed variable reference will not provide any starting package name for the  'fetch'  method  lookup.
       Thus,  this  circumstance  will  not  result  in  a  method call for package-defined attributes.  A named
       subroutine knows to which symbol table entry it belongs (or originally belonged), and  it  will  use  the
       corresponding package.  An anonymous subroutine knows the package name into which it was compiled (unless
       it was also compiled with a null package declaration), and so it will use that package name.

   <b>Syntax</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attribute</b> <b>Lists</b>
       An  attribute  list  is  a sequence of attribute specifications, separated by whitespace or a colon (with
       optional whitespace).   Each  attribute  specification  is  a  simple  name,  optionally  followed  by  a
       parenthesised  parameter  list.  If such a parameter list is present, it is scanned past as for the rules
       for the q() operator.  (See "Quote and Quote-like Operators" in perlop.)  The parameter list is passed as
       it was found, however, and not as per q().

       Some examples of syntactically valid attribute lists:

           switch(10,foo(7,3))  :  expensive
           Ugly('\(") :Bad
           _5x5
           lvalue method

       Some examples of syntactically invalid attribute lists (with annotation):

           switch(10,foo()             # ()-string not balanced
           Ugly('(')                   # ()-string not balanced
           5x5                         # "5x5" not a valid identifier
           Y2::north                   # "Y2::north" not a simple identifier
           foo + bar                   # "+" neither a colon nor whitespace

   <b>Default</b> <b>exports</b>
       None.

   <b>Available</b> <b>exports</b>
       The routines "get" and "reftype" are exportable.

   <b>Export</b> <b>tags</b> <b>defined</b>
       The ":ALL" tag will get all of the above exports.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here are some samples of syntactically valid  declarations,  with  annotation  as  to  how  they  resolve
       internally into "use attributes" invocations by perl.  These examples are primarily useful to see how the
       "appropriate package" is found for the possible method lookups for package-defined attributes.

       1.  Code:

               package Canine;
               package Dog;
               my Canine $spot : Watchful ;

           Effect:

               use attributes ();
               attributes::-&gt;import(Canine =&gt; \$spot, "Watchful");

       2.  Code:

               package Felis;
               my $cat : Nervous;

           Effect:

               use attributes ();
               attributes::-&gt;import(Felis =&gt; \$cat, "Nervous");

       3.  Code:

               package X;
               sub foo : lvalue ;

           Effect:

               use attributes X =&gt; \&amp;foo, "lvalue";

       4.  Code:

               package X;
               sub Y::x : lvalue { 1 }

           Effect:

               use attributes Y =&gt; \&amp;Y::x, "lvalue";

       5.  Code:

               package X;
               sub foo { 1 }

               package Y;
               BEGIN { *bar = \&amp;X::foo; }

               package Z;
               sub Y::bar : lvalue ;

           Effect:

               use attributes X =&gt; \&amp;X::foo, "lvalue";

       This  last  example  is  purely  for purposes of completeness.  You should not be trying to mess with the
       attributes of something in a package that's not your own.

</pre><h4><b>MORE</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       1.
               sub MODIFY_CODE_ATTRIBUTES {
                  my ($class,$code,@attrs) = @_;

                  my $allowed = 'MyAttribute';
                  my @bad = grep { $_ ne $allowed } @attrs;

                  return @bad;
               }

               sub foo : MyAttribute {
                  print "foo\n";
               }

           This example runs.  At compile time "MODIFY_CODE_ATTRIBUTES" is called.  In that subroutine, we check
           if any attribute is disallowed and we return a list of these "bad attributes".

           As we return an empty list, everything is fine.

       2.
             sub MODIFY_CODE_ATTRIBUTES {
                my ($class,$code,@attrs) = @_;

                my $allowed = 'MyAttribute';
                my @bad = grep{ $_ ne $allowed }@attrs;

                return @bad;
             }

             sub foo : MyAttribute Test {
                print "foo\n";
             }

           This example is aborted at compile  time  as  we  use  the  attribute  "Test"  which  isn't  allowed.
           "MODIFY_CODE_ATTRIBUTES" returns a list that contains a single element ('Test').
