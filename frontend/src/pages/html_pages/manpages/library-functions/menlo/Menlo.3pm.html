</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Menlo - A CPAN client

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Menlo is a backend for <u>cpanm</u> <u>2.0</u>, developed with the goal to replace cpanm internals with a set of
       modules that are more flexible, extensible and easier to use.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Menlo is developed within cpanminus git repository at "Menlo" subdirectory at
       &lt;https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus&gt;

       Menlo::CLI::Compat started off as a copy of App::cpanminus::script, but will go under a big refactoring
       to extract all the bits out of it. Hopefully the end result will be just a shim and translation layer to
       interpret command line options.

</pre><h4><b>MOTIVATION</b></h4><pre>
       cpanm has been a popular choice of CPAN package installer for many developers, because it is lightweight,
       fast, and requires no configuration in most environments.

       Meanwhile, the way cpanm has been implemented (one God class, and all modules are packaged in one script
       with fatpacker) makes it difficult to extend, or modify the behaviors at a runtime, unless you decide to
       fork the code or monkeypatch its hidden backend class.

       cpanm also has no scriptable API or hook points, which means if you want to write a tool that works with
       cpanm, you basically have to work around its behavior by writing a shell wrapper, or parsing the output
       of its standard out or a build log file.

       Menlo will keep the best aspects of cpanm, which is dependencies free, configuration free, lightweight
       and fast to install CPAN modules. At the same time, it's impelmented as a standard perl module, available
       on CPAN, and you can extend its behavior by either using its modular interfaces, or writing plugins to
       hook into its behaviors.

</pre><h4><b>FAQ</b></h4><pre>
       Dependencies free? I see many prerequisites in Menlo.
           Menlo  is  a  set  of  libraries  and  uses  non-core CPAN modules as its dependencies. App-cpanminus
           distribution embeds Menlo and all of its runtime dependencies into a fatpacked binary,  so  that  you
           can install App-cpanminus or Menlo without having any CPAN client to begin with.

       Is Menlo a new name for cpanm?
           Right now it's just a library name, but I'm comfortable calling this a new package name for cpanm 2's
           backend.
