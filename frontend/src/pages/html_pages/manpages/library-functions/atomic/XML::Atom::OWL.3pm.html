</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XML::Atom::OWL - parse an Atom file into RDF

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use XML::Atom::OWL;

        $parser = XML::Atom::OWL-&gt;new($xml, $baseuri);
        $graph  = $parser-&gt;graph;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This has a pretty similar interface to RDF::RDFa::Parser.

   <b>Constructor</b>
       "new($xml, $baseuri, \%options, $storage)"
           This method creates a new XML::Atom::OWL object and returns it.

           The  $xml variable may contain an XML (Atom) string, or an XML::LibXML::Document object. If a string,
           the document is parsed using XML::LibXML, which will throw an exception if  it  is  not  well-formed.
           XML::Atom::OWL does not catch the exception.

           The base URI is used to resolve relative URIs found in the document.

           Currently  only  one option is defined, 'no_fetch_content_src', a boolean indicating whether &lt;content
           src&gt; URLs should be automatically fetched and added to the  model  as  if  inline  content  had  been
           provided. They are fetched by default, but it's pretty rare for feeds to include this attribute.

           $storage is an RDF::Trine::Storage object. If undef, then a new temporary store is created.

   <b>Public</b> <b>Methods</b>
       "uri"
           Returns  the  base  URI  of  the document being parsed. This will usually be the same as the base URI
           provided to the constructor.

           Optionally it may be passed a parameter - an absolute or relative URI - in which case it returns  the
           same  URI  which  it  was  passed  as  a  parameter, but as an absolute URI, resolved relative to the
           document's base URI.

           This seems like two unrelated functions, but if you consider the consequence of  passing  a  relative
           URI consisting of a zero-length string, it in fact makes sense.

       "dom"
           Returns the parsed XML::LibXML::Document.

       "graph"
           This method will return an RDF::Trine::Model object with all statements of the full graph.

           This method automatically calls "consume".

       "root_identifier"
           Returns the blank node or URI for the root element of the Atom document as an RDF::Trine::Node

           Calls "consume" automatically.

       set_callbacks(\%callbacks)
           Set callback functions for the parser to call on certain events. These are only necessary if you want
           to do something especially unusual.

             $p-&gt;set_callbacks({
               'pretriple_resource' =&gt; sub { ... } ,
               'pretriple_literal'  =&gt; sub { ... } ,
               'ontriple'           =&gt; undef ,
               });

           For details of the callback functions, see the section CALLBACKS. "set_callbacks" must be used <u>before</u>
           "consume". "set_callbacks" itself returns a reference to the parser object itself.

       "consume"
           The  document  is parsed. Triples extracted from the document are passed to the callbacks as each one
           is found; triples are made available in the model returned by the "graph" method.

           This  function  returns  the  parser  object  itself,  making  it  easy  to  abbreviate  several   of
           XML::Atom::OWL's functions:

             my $iterator = XML::Atom::OWL-&gt;new(undef, $uri)
                            -&gt;consume-&gt;graph-&gt;as_stream;

           You probably only need to call this explicitly if you're using callbacks.

</pre><h4><b>CALLBACKS</b></h4><pre>
       Several  callback  functions  are  provided.  These  may be set using the "set_callbacks" function, which
       taskes a hashref of keys pointing to coderefs. The keys are named for the event to fire the callback on.

   <b>pretriple_resource</b>
       This is called when a triple has been found, but before preparing the triple for adding to the model.  It
       is only called for triples with a non-literal object value.

       The parameters passed to the callback function are:

       •   A reference to the "XML::Atom::OWL" object

       •   A reference to the "XML::LibXML::Element" being parsed

       •   Subject URI or bnode (string)

       •   Predicate URI (string)

       •   Object URI or bnode (string)

       •   Graph URI or bnode (string or undef)

       The  callback  should return 1 to tell the parser to skip this triple (not add it to the graph); return 0
       otherwise.

   <b>pretriple_literal</b>
       This is the equivalent of pretriple_resource, but is only called for triples with a literal object value.

       The parameters passed to the callback function are:

       •   A reference to the "XML::Atom::OWL" object

       •   A reference to the "XML::LibXML::Element" being parsed

       •   Subject URI or bnode (string)

       •   Predicate URI (string)

       •   Object literal (string)

       •   Datatype URI (string or undef)

       •   Language (string or undef)

       •   Graph URI or bnode (string or undef)

       Beware: sometimes both a datatype <u>and</u> a language will be passed.  This goes beyond the  normal  RDF  data
       model.)

       The  callback  should return 1 to tell the parser to skip this triple (not add it to the graph); return 0
       otherwise.

   <b>ontriple</b>
       This is called once a triple is ready to be added to the graph.  (After  the  pretriple  callbacks.)  The
       parameters passed to the callback function are:

       •   A reference to the "XML::Atom::OWL" object

       •   A reference to the "XML::LibXML::Element" being parsed

       •   An RDF::Trine::Statement object.

       The  callback  should return 1 to tell the parser to skip this triple (not add it to the graph); return 0
       otherwise. The callback may modify the RDF::Trine::Statement object.
