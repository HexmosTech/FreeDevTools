</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Chemistry::Atom - Chemical atoms as objects in molecules

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Chemistry::Atom;

           my $atom = new Chemistry::Atom(
               id =&gt; 'a1',
               coords =&gt; [$x, $y, $z],
               symbol =&gt; 'Br'
           );

           print $atom-&gt;print;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module includes objects to describe chemical atoms.  An atom is defined by its symbol and its
       coordinates, among other attributes.  Atomic coordinates are described by a Math::VectorReal object, so
       that they can be easily used in vector operations.

   <b>Atom</b> <b>Attributes</b>
       In addition to common attributes such as id, name, and type, atoms have the following attributes, which
       are accessed or modified through methods defined below: bonds, coords, internal_coords, Z, symbol, etc.

       In general, to get the value of a property, use $atom-&gt;method without any parameters. To set the value,
       use $atom-&gt;method($new_value). When setting an attribute, the accessor returns the atom object, so that
       accessors can be chained:

           $atom-&gt;symbol("C")-&gt;name("CA")-&gt;coords(1,2,3);

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Chemistry::Atom-&gt;new(name =&gt; value, ...)
           Create a new Atom object with the specified attributes.

       $atom-&gt;Z($new_Z)
           Sets  and  returns  the  atomic  number  (Z). If the symbol of the atom doesn't correspond to a known
           element, Z = undef.

       $atom-&gt;symbol($new_symbol)
           Sets and returns the atomic symbol.

       $atom-&gt;mass($new_mass)
           Sets and returns the atomic mass in atomic mass units. Any arbitrary mass may be  set  explicitly  by
           using  this  method.  However, if no mass is set explicitly and this method is called as an accessor,
           the return value is the following:

           1) If the mass number is undefined (see the mass_number method below), the relative atomic mass  from
           the  1995  IUPAC  recommendation  is  used. (Table stolen from the Chemistry::MolecularMass module by
           Maksim A.  Khrapov).

           2) If the mass number is defined and the Chemistry::Isotope module is available and it knows the mass
           for the isotope, the exact mass of the isotope is used; otherwise, the mass number is returned.

       $atom-&gt;mass_number($new_mass_number)
           Sets or gets the mass number. The mass number is undefined unless is set explicitly (this module does
           not try to guess a default mass number based on the natural occurring isotope distribution).

       $atom-&gt;coords
               my $vector = $atom-&gt;coords;  # get a Math::VectorReal object
               $atom-&gt;coords($vector);      # set a Math::VectorReal object
               $atom-&gt;coords([$x, $y, $z]); # also accepts array refs
               $atom-&gt;coords($x, $y, $z);   # also accepts lists

           Sets or gets the atom's coordinates. It  can  take  as  a  parameter  a  Math::VectorReal  object,  a
           reference to an array, or the list of coordinates.

       $atom-&gt;internal_coords
               # get a Chemistry::InternalCoords object
               my $ic = $atom-&gt;internal_coords;

               # set a Chemistry::InternalCoords object
               $atom-&gt;internal_coords($vic);

               # also accepts array refs
               $atom-&gt;internal_coords([8, 1.54, 7, 109.47, 6, 120.0]);

               # also accepts lists
               $atom-&gt;internal_coords(8, 1.54, 7, 109.47, 6, 120.0);

           Sets  or gets the atom's internal coordinates. It can take as a parameter a Chemistry::InternalCoords
           object, a reference to an array, or the list of coordinates. In the last two cases, the list elements
           are the following: atom number or reference for distance, distance,  atom  number  or  reference  for
           angle, angle in degrees, atom number or reference for dihedral, dihedral in degrees.

       $atom-&gt;x3, $atom-&gt;y3, $atom-&gt;z3
           Get  the  x,  y or z 3D coordinate of the atom. This methods are just accessors that don't change the
           coordinates. $atom-&gt;x3 is short for ($atom-&gt;coords-&gt;array)[0], and so on.

       $atom-&gt;formal_charge($charge)
           Set or get the formal charge of the atom.

       $atom-&gt;formal_radical($radical)
           Set or get the formal radical multiplicity for the atom.

       $atom-&gt;implicit_hydrogens($h_count)
           Set or get the number of implicit hydrogen atoms bonded to the atom.

       $atom-&gt;hydrogens($h_count)
           Set  or  get  the  number  of  implicit  hydrogen  atoms  bonded  to  the   atom   (DEPRECATED:   USE
           "implicit_hydrogens" INSTEAD).

       $atom-&gt;total_hydrogens($h_count)
           Get the total number of hydrogen atoms bonded to the atom (implicit + explicit).

       $atom-&gt;sprout_hydrogens
           Convert  all  the  implicit hydrogens for this atom to explicit hydrogens. Note: it does <b>not</b> generate
           coordinates for the new atoms.

       $atom-&gt;collapse_hydrogens
           Delete neighboring hydrogen atoms and add them as implicit hydrogens for this atom.

       $atom-&gt;calc_implicit_hydrogens
           Use heuristics to figure out how many implicit hydrogens should the atom have to satisfy  its  normal
           "organic" valence. Returns the number of hydrogens but does not affect the atom object.

       $atom-&gt;add_implicit_hydrogens
           Similar  to calc_implicit_hydrogens, but it also sets the number of implicit hydrogens in the atom to
           the new calculated value. Equivalent to

               $atom-&gt;implicit_hydrogens($atom-&gt;calc_implicit_hydrogens);

           It returns the atom object.

       $atom-&gt;aromatic($bool)
           Set or get whether the atom is considered to be aromatic. This property may be  set  arbitrarily,  it
           doesn't imply any kind of "intelligent aromaticity detection"! (For that, look at the Chemistry::Ring
           module).

       $atom-&gt;valence
           Returns  the  sum  of the bond orders of the bonds in which the atom participates, including implicit
           hydrogens (which are assumed to have bond orders of one).

       $atom-&gt;explicit_valence
           Like "valence", but excluding implicit hydrogen atoms. To  get  the  raw  number  of  bonds,  without
           counting bond orders, call $atom-&gt;bonds in scalar context.

       $atom-&gt;delete
           Calls $mol-&gt;delete_atom($atom) on the atom's parent molecule.

       $atom-&gt;parent
           Returns the atom's containing object (the molecule to which the atom belongs).  An atom can only have
           one parent.

       $atom-&gt;neighbors($from)
           Return  a  list of neighbors. If an atom object $from is specified, it will be excluded from the list
           (this is useful if an atom wants to know who its neighbor's neighbors are, without counting itself).

       $atom-&gt;bonds($from)
           Return a list of bonds. If an atom object $from is specified, bonds to that  atom  will  be  excluded
           from the list.

       $atom-&gt;bonds_neighbors($from)
           Return  a  list  of  hash  references, representing the bonds and neighbors from the atom. If an atom
           object $from is specified, it will be excluded from the list.  The elements of the hash are 'to', and
           atom reference, and 'bond', a bond reference. For example,

               for my $bn ($atom-&gt;bonds_neighbors) {
                   print "bond $bn-&gt;{bond} point to atom $bn-&gt;{to}\n";
               }

       ($distance, $closest_atom) = $atom-&gt;distance($obj)
           Returns the minimum distance to $obj, which can be an atom,  a  molecule,  or  a  vector.  In  scalar
           context  it returns only the distance; in list context it also returns the closest atom found. It can
           also be called as a function, Chemistry::Atom::distance (which can be exported).

       $atom-&gt;angle($atom2, $atom3)
           Returns the angle in radians between the atoms involved. $atom2 is the atom in the middle.  Can  also
           be  called as Chemistry::Atom::angle($atom1, $atom2, $atom3). This function can be exported. Note: if
           you override this method, you may also need to override angle_deg or strange things may happen.

       $atom-&gt;angle_deg($atom2, $atom3)
           Same as <b>angle()</b>, but returns the value in degrees. May be exported.

       $atom-&gt;dihedral($atom2, $atom3, $atom4)
           Returns the  dihedral  angle  in  radians  between  the  atoms  involved.   Can  also  be  called  as
           Chemistry::Atom::dihedral($atom1,  $atom2,  $atom3,  $atom4).  May be exported. Note: if you override
           this method, you may also need to override dihedral_deg and angle or strange things may happen.

       $atom-&gt;dihedral_deg($atom2, $atom3, $atom4)
           Same as <b>dihedral()</b>, but returns the value in degrees. May be exported.

       $atom-&gt;print
           Convert the atom to a string representation (used for debugging).

       my $info = $atom-&gt;sprintf($format)
           Format interesting atomic information in a concise way, as specified by a printf-like format.

               %s - symbol
               %Z - atomic number
               %n - name
               %q - formal charge
               %h - implicit hydrogen count
               %v - valence
               %i - id
               %8.3m - mass, formatted as %8.3f with core sprintf
               %8.3x - x coordinate, formatted as %8.3f with core sprintf
               %8.3y - y coordinate, formatted as %8.3f with core sprintf
               %8.3z - z coordinate, formatted as %8.3f with core sprintf
               %% - %

       $atom-&gt;printf($format)
           Same as $atom-&gt;sprintf, but prints to standard output automatically. Used for quick and dirty  atomic
           information dumping.
