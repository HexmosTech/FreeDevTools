</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a minimal API for generating Atom syndication feeds quickly and easily.  It supports all aspects
       of the Atom format itself but has no mechanism for the inclusion of extension elements.

       You can supply strings for most things, and the module will provide useful defaults. When you want more
       control, you can provide data structures, as documented, to specify more particulars.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"new"</b>
       Takes a list of key-value pairs.

       Most keys are used to create corresponding "Atom elements".  To specify multiple instances of an element
       that may be given multiple times, pass multiple key-value pairs with the same key.

       Keys that start with a dash specify how the XML document will be generated.

       The following keys are supported:

       •   "-encoding" (<u>omissible</u>, default "us-ascii")

       •   ""id"" (<u>omissible</u>)

       •   ""link"" (<u>omissible</u>, multiple)

       •   ""title"" (<b>required</b>)

       •   ""author"" (optional, multiple)

       •   ""category"" (optional, multiple)

       •   ""contributor"" (optional, multiple)

       •   ""generator"" (optional)

       •   ""icon"" (optional)

       •   ""logo"" (optional)

       •   ""rights"" (optional)

       •   ""subtitle"" (optional)

       •   ""updated"" (optional)

   <b>"add_entry"</b>
       Takes  a  list  of  key-value  pairs,  used to create corresponding "Atom elements".  To specify multiple
       instances of an element that may be given multiple times, pass multiple key-value  pairs  with  the  same
       key.

       The following keys are supported:

       •   ""author"" (<b>required</b> unless there is a feed-level author, multiple)

       •   ""id"" (<u>omissible</u>)

       •   ""link"" (<b>required</b>, multiple)

       •   ""title"" (<b>required</b>)

       •   ""category"" (optional, multiple)

       •   ""content"" (optional)

       •   ""contributor"" (optional, multiple)

       •   ""published"" (optional)

       •   ""rights"" (optional)

       •   ""summary"" (optional)

       •   ""updated"" (optional)

   <b>"as_string"</b>
       Returns the XML representation of the feed as a string.

   <b>"print"</b>
       Outputs the XML representation of the feed to a handle which should be passed as a parameter. Defaults to
       "STDOUT" if you do not pass a handle.

</pre><h4><b>ATOM</b> <b>ELEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"author"</b>
       A "Person Construct" denoting the author of the feed or entry.

       If  you  supply  at least one author for the feed, you can omit this information from entries; the feed's
       author(s) will be assumed as the author(s) for those entries. If you do not supply  any  author  for  the
       feed, you <b>must</b> supply one for each entry.

   <b>"category"</b>
       One or more categories that apply to the feed or entry. You can supply a string which will be used as the
       category term. The full range of details that can be provided by passing a hash instead of a string is as
       follows:

       "term" (<b>required</b>)
           The category term.

       "scheme" (optional)
           A URI that identifies a categorization scheme.

           It  is  common  to  provide  the  base  of  some  kind  of by-category URL here. F.ex., if the weblog
           "<a href="http://www.example.com/blog/">http://www.example.com/blog/</a>"   can   be    browsed    by    category    using    URLs    such    as
           "<a href="http://www.example.com/blog/category/personal">http://www.example.com/blog/category/personal</a>",             you             would             supply
           "<a href="http://www.example.com/blog/category/">http://www.example.com/blog/category/</a>" as the scheme and, in that case, "personal" as the term.

       "label" (optional)
           A human-readable version of the term.

   <b>"content"</b>
       The actual, honest-to-goodness, body of the entry. This is like a "Text  Construct",  with  a  couple  of
       extras.

       In  addition  to  the  "type"  values  of  a  "Text Construct", you can also supply any MIME Type (except
       multipart types, which the Atom format specification forbids). If you specify a "text/*" type,  the  same
       rules  apply as for "text".  If you pass a "*/xml" or "*/*+xml" type, the same rules apply as for "xhtml"
       (except in that case there is no wrapper  "&lt;div&gt;"  element).  Any  other  type  will  be  transported  as
       Base64-encoded binary.

       XXX Furthermore, you can supply a "src" key in place of the "content" key. In that case, the value of the
       "src"  key  should  be  a  URL  denoting  the actual location of the content. FIXME This is not currently
       supported. XXX

   <b>"contributor"</b>
       A "Person Construct" denoting a contributor to the feed or entry.

   <b>"generator"</b>
       The software used to generate the feed. Can be supplied as a string or as a hash  with  "uri",  "version"
       and  "name"  keys.  Can also be undef to suppress the element entirely. If nothing is passed, defaults to
       reporting XML::Atom::SimpleFeed as the generator.

   <b>"icon"</b>
       The URI of a small image whose width and height should be identical.

   <b>"id"</b>
       A URI that is a permanent, globally unique identifier for the feed or entry that <b>MUST</b> <b>NEVER</b> <b>CHANGE</b>.

       You are encouraged to generate a UUID using Data::UUID for the purpose of identifying  entries/feeds.  It
       should be stored alongside the resource corresponding to the entry/feed, f.ex. in a column of the article
       table   of   your   weblog   database.   To   use  it  as  an  identifier  in  the  entry/feed,  use  the
       "urn:uuid:########-####-####-####-############" URI form.

       If you do not specify an ID, the permalink will be  used  instead.  This  is  unwise,  as  permalinks  do
       unfortunately occasionally change.  <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>permalink</b> <b>NEVER</b> <b>CHANGES.</b>

   <b>"link"</b>
       A link element. You can either supply a bare string as the parameter, which will be used as the permalink
       URI,  or  a hash. The permalink for a feed is generally a browser-viewable weblog, upload browser, search
       engine results page or similar web page; for an entry, it is generally a browser-viewable article, upload
       details page, search result or similar web page. This URI <u>should</u> be unique. If you supply a hash, you can
       provide the following range of details in the given hash keys:

       "rel" (optional)
           The link relationship. If omitted, defaults to "alternate" (note that you can only have one alternate
           link per feed/entry). Other permissible values are "related", "self", "enclosure" and "via", as  well
           as any URI.

       "href" (<b>required</b> URL)
           Where the link points to.

       "type" (optional)
           An advisory media type that provides a hint about the type of the resource pointed to by the link.

       "hreflang" (optional)
           The language of the resource pointed to by the link, an an RFC3066 language tag.

       "title" (optional)
           Human-readable information about the link.

       "length" (optional)
           A hint about the content length in bytes of the resource pointed to by the link.

   <b>"logo"</b>
       The URI of an image that should be twice as wide as it is high.

   <b>"published"</b>
       A  "Date  Construct"  denoting  the  moment in time when the entry was first published. This should never
       change.

   <b>"rights"</b>
       A "Text Construct" containing a human-readable statement of legal rights for the content of the  feed  or
       entry. This is not intended for machine processing.

   <b>"subtitle"</b>
       A "Text Construct" containing an optional additional description of the feed.

   <b>"summary"</b>
       A "Text Construct" giving a short summary of the entry.

   <b>"title"</b>
       A "Text Construct" containing the title of the feed or entry.

   <b>"updated"</b>
       A  "Date  Construct" denoting the moment in time when the feed or entry was last updated. Defaults to the
       current date and time if omitted.

       In entries, you can use this element to signal <u>significant</u> changes at your discretion.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>ATOM</b> <b>CONSTRUCTS</b></h4><pre>
       A number of Atom elements share a common structure. The following sections outline the data you  can  (or
       must) pass in each case.

   <b>Date</b> <b>Construct</b>
       A string denoting a date and time in W3CDTF format. You can generate those using something like

        use POSIX 'strftime';
        my $now = strftime '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ', gmtime;

       However,  you can also simply pass a Unix timestamp (a positive integer) or an object that responds to an
       "epoch" method call. (Make sure that the timezone reported by such objects is correct!)

       The following datetime classes from CPAN are compatible with this interface:

       •   Time::Piece

       •   DateTime

       •   Time::Moment

       •   Panda::Date

       •   Class::Date

       •   Time::Object (an obsolete precursor to Time::Piece)

       •   Time::Date (version 0.05 or newer)

       The following are not:

       •   DateTime::Tiny

           This class lacks both an "epoch" method or any way to emulate one – as well as any  timezone  support
           in  the  first  place.  That makes it unsuitable in principle for use in Atom feeds – unless you have
           separate information about the timezone.

       •   Date::Handler

           This class has a suitable method… but sadly, calls it "Epoch".  So it is  left  up  to  you  to  call
           "$dh-&gt;Epoch" to pass such values.

   <b>Person</b> <b>Construct</b>
       You can supply a string to Person Construct parameters, which will be used as the name of the person. The
       full range of details that can be provided by passing a hash instead of a string is as follows:

       "name" (<b>required</b>)
           The name of the person.

       "email" (optional)
           The person's email address.

       "uri" (optional)
           A  URI  to  distinguish  this  person.  This  would usually be a homepage, but need not actually be a
           dereferencable URL.

   <b>Text</b> <b>Construct</b>
       You can supply a string to Text Construct parameters, which will be used  as  the  HTML  content  of  the
       element.

       FIXME details, text/html/xhtml

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       •   Atom Enabled (&lt;<a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/">http://www.atomenabled.org/</a>&gt;)

       •   W3CDTF Spec (&lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime">http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime</a>&gt;)

       •   RFC 3066 (&lt;<a href="http://rfc.net/rfc3066.html">http://rfc.net/rfc3066.html</a>&gt;)

       •   XML::Atom::Syndication

       •   XML::Feed

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In "content" elements, the "src" attribute cannot be used, and non-XML or non-text media types do not get
       Base64-encoded automatically. This is a bug.

       There are practically no tests. This is a bug.

       Support  for  "xml:lang"  and  "xml:base"  is  completely  absent.  This is a bug and should be partially
       addressed in a future version. There are  however  no  plans  to  allow  these  attributes  on  arbitrary
       elements.

       There  are  no  plans  to  ever  support generating feeds with arbitrary extensions, although support for
       specific extensions may or may not be added in the future.

       The "source" element is not and may never be supported.

       Nothing is done to ensure that text constructs with type "xhtml" and entry contents using either that  or
       an  XML  media type are well-formed. So far, this is by design. You should strongly consider using an XML
       writer if you want to include content with such types in your feed.
