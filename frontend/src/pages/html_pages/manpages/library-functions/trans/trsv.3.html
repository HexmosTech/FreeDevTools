           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                      On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
                      N must be at least zero.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension ( LDA, N )
                      Before entry with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading n by n
                      upper triangular part of the array A must contain the upper
                      triangular matrix and the strictly lower triangular part of
                      A is not referenced.
                      Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading n by n
                      lower triangular part of the array A must contain the lower
                      triangular matrix and the strictly upper triangular part of
                      A is not referenced.
                      Note that when  DIAG = 'U' or 'u', the diagonal elements of
                      A are not referenced either, but are assumed to be unity.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                      On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
                      in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least
                      max( 1, n ).

           <u>X</u>

                     X is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension at least
                      ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ).
                      Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n
                      element right-hand side vector b. On exit, X is overwritten
                      with the solution vector x.

           <u>INCX</u>

                     INCX is INTEGER
                      On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of
                      X. INCX must not be zero.
