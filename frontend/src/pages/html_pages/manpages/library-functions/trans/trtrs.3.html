       <b>CTRTRS</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CTRTRS solves a triangular system of the form

               A * X = B,  A**T * X = B,  or  A**H * X = B,

            where A is a triangular matrix of order N, and B is an N-by-NRHS matrix.

            This subroutine verifies that A is nonsingular, but callers should note that only exact
            singularity is detected. It is conceivable for one or more diagonal elements of A to be
            subnormally tiny numbers without this subroutine signalling an error.

            If a possible loss of numerical precision due to near-singular matrices is a concern, the
            caller should verify that A is nonsingular within some tolerance before calling this subroutine.

                     triangular matrix, and the strictly lower triangular part of

                     &gt; 0:  if INFO = i, the i-th diagonal element of A is exactly zero,
                          indicating that the matrix is singular and the solutions

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0:  successful exit
