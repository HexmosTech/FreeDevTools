       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CTPSV  solves one of the systems of equations

            where b and x are n element vectors and A is an n by n unit, or
            non-unit, upper or lower triangular matrix, supplied in packed form.

            No test for singularity or near-singularity is included in this
            routine. Such tests must be performed before calling this routine.

                                             triangular.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                      On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
                      N must be at least zero.

           <u>AP</u>

                     AP is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension at least
                      ( ( n*( n + 1 ) )/2 ).
                      Before entry with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the array AP must
                      contain the upper triangular matrix packed sequentially,
                      column by column, so that AP( 1 ) contains a( 1, 1 ),
                      AP( 2 ) and AP( 3 ) contain a( 1, 2 ) and a( 2, 2 )
                      respectively, and so on.
                      Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the array AP must
                      contain the lower triangular matrix packed sequentially,
                      column by column, so that AP( 1 ) contains a( 1, 1 ),
                      AP( 2 ) and AP( 3 ) contain a( 2, 1 ) and a( 3, 1 )
                      respectively, and so on.
                      Note that when  DIAG = 'U' or 'u', the diagonal elements of
                      A are not referenced, but are assumed to be unity.

           <u>X</u>

                     X is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension at least
                      ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ).
                      Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n
                      element right-hand side vector b. On exit, X is overwritten
                      with the solution vector x.

           <u>INCX</u>

                     INCX is INTEGER
                      On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of
                      X. INCX must not be zero.
