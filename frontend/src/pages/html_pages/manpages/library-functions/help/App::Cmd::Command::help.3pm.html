</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Cmd::Command::help - display a command's help screen

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.337

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command will either list all of the application commands and their abstracts, or display the usage
       screen for a subcommand with its description.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The help text is generated from three sources:

       •   The "usage_desc" method

       •   The "description" method

       •   The "opt_spec" data structure

       The  "usage_desc"  method  provides  the  opening  usage  line,  following the specification described in
       Getopt::Long::Descriptive.   In  some  cases,  the  default  "usage_desc"  in  App::Cmd::Command  may  be
       sufficient and you will only need to override it to provide additional command line usage information.

       The  "opt_spec"  data structure is used with Getopt::Long::Descriptive to generate the description of the
       options.

       Subcommand classes should override the "discription" method to provide  additional  information  that  is
       prepended before the option descriptions.

       For example, consider the following subcommand module:

         package YourApp::Command::initialize;

         # This is the default from App::Cmd::Command
         sub usage_desc {
           my ($self) = @_;
           my $desc = $self-&gt;SUPER::usage_desc; # "%c COMMAND %o"
           return "$desc [DIRECTORY]";
         }

         sub description {
           return "The initialize command prepares the application...";
         }

         sub opt_spec {
           return (
             [ "skip-refs|R",  "skip reference checks during init", ],
             [ "values|v=s@",  "starting values", { default =&gt; [ 0, 1, 3 ] } ],
           );
         }

         ...

       That module would generate help output like this:

         $ yourapp help initialize
         yourapp initialize [-Rv] [long options...] [DIRECTORY]

         The initialize command prepares the application...

               --help            This usage screen
               -R --skip-refs    skip reference checks during init
               -v --values       starting values
