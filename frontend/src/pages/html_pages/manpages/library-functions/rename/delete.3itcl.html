       itcl::delete - delete things in the interpreter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>itcl::delete</b> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>delete</b>  command  is  used to delete things in the interpreter.  It is implemented as an ensemble, so
       extensions can add their own options and extend the behavior of this command.   By  default,  the  <b>delete</b>
       command handles the destruction of namespaces.

       The  <u>option</u>  argument determines what action is carried out by the command.  The legal <u>options</u> (which may
       be abbreviated) are:

       <b>delete</b> <b>class</b> <u>name</u> ?<u>name...</u>?
              Deletes one or more <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b> classes called <u>name</u>.  This deletes all objects in  the  class,  and
              all derived classes as well.

              If  an  error  is  encountered while destructing an object, it will prevent the destruction of the
              class and any remaining objects.  To destroy the entire class without regard for errors,  use  the
              "<b>delete</b> <b>namespace</b>" command.

       <b>delete</b> <b>object</b> <u>name</u> ?<u>name...</u>?
              Deletes  one  or  more  <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b>  objects  called  <u>name</u>.   An  object is deleted by invoking all
              destructors in its class hierarchy, in order from most- to least-specific.  If all destructors are
              successful, data associated with the object is deleted and the <u>name</u> is removed as a  command  from
              the interpreter.

              If  the  access command for an object resides in another namespace, then its qualified name can be
              used:

                     itcl::delete object foo::bar::x

              If an error is encountered while destructing an object, the <b>delete</b>  command  is  aborted  and  the
              object remains alive.  To destroy an object without regard for errors, use the "<b>rename</b>" command to
              destroy the object access command.

       <b>delete</b> <b>namespace</b> <u>name</u> ?<u>name...</u>?
              Deletes  one  or  more  namespaces  called  <u>name</u>.   This deletes all commands and variables in the
              namespace, and deletes all child  namespaces  as  well.   When  a  namespace  is  deleted,  it  is
              automatically removed from the import lists of all other namespaces.
