</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Email::Folder::Mbox - reads raw RFC822 mails from an mbox file

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.860

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This isa Email::Folder::Reader - read about its API there.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Does exactly what it says on the tin - fetches raw RFC822 mails from an mbox.

       The mbox format is described at <a href="http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/mbox.html">http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/mbox.html</a>

       We attempt to read an mbox as through it's the mboxcl2 variant, falling back to regular mbox mode if
       there is no "Content-Length" header to be found.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       The new constructor takes extra options.

       "fh"
           When  filename  is  set  to "FH" than Email::Folder::Mbox will read mbox archive from filehandle "fh"
           instead from disk file "filename".

       "eol"
           This indicates what the line-ending style is to be.  The default is "\n", but for handling files with
           mac line-endings you would want to specify "eol =&gt; "\x0d""

       "jwz_From_"
           The value is taken as a boolean that governs what is used match as a message separator.

           If false we use the mutt style

            /^From \S+\s+(?:Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun)/
            /^From (?:Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun)/;

           If true we use

            /^From /

           In deference to this extract from &lt;<a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/content-length.html">http://www.jwz.org/doc/content-length.html</a>&gt;

             Essentially the only safe way to parse that file format is to
             consider all lines which begin with the characters ``From ''
             (From-space), which are preceded by a blank line or
             beginning-of-file, to be the division between messages.  That is, the
             delimiter is "\n\nFrom .*\n" except for the very first message in the
             file, where it is "^From .*\n".

             Some people will tell you that you should do stricter parsing on
             those lines: check for user names and dates and so on.  They are
             wrong.  The random crap that has traditionally been dumped into that
             line is without bound; comparing the first five characters is the
             only safe and portable thing to do. Usually, but not always, the next
             token on the line after ``From '' will be a user-id, or email
             address, or UUCP path, and usually the next thing on the line will be
             a date specification, in some format, and usually there's nothing
             after that.  But you can't rely on any of this.

           Defaults to false.

       "unescape"
           This boolean value indicates whenever lines which starts with

            /^&gt;+From /

           should be unescaped (= removed leading '&gt;' char). This is needed for mboxrd and mboxcl variants.  But
           there is no way to detect for used mbox variant, so default value is false.

       "seek_to"
           Seek  to  an  offset  when opening the mbox.  When used in combination with -&gt;tell you may be able to
           resume reading, with a trailing wind.

       "next_message"
           This returns next message as string

       "next_messageref"
           This returns next message as ref to string

       "tell"
           This returns the current filehandle position in the mbox.

       "next_from"
           This returns the From_ line for next message. Call it before -&gt;next_message.

       "messageid"
           This returns the messageid of last read message. Call if after -&gt;next_message.
