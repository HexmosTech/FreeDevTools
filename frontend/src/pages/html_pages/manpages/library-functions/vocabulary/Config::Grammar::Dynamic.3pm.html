       Config::Grammar::Dynamic - A grammar-based, user-friendly config parser

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Config::Grammar::Dynamic is like Config::Grammar but with some additional features useful for building
       configuration grammars that are dynamic, i.e.  where the syntax changes according to configuration
       entries in the same file.

       The following keys can be additionally specified in the grammar when using this module:

   <b>Special</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Keys</b>
       _dyn        A  subroutine  reference  (function  pointer)  that will be called when a new section of this
                   syntax is encountered. The subroutine will get three arguments: the  syntax  of  the  section
                   name  (string  or  regexp),  the  actual name encountered (this will be the same as the first
                   argument for non-regexp sections) and a reference to the grammar tree of the  section.   This
                   subroutine can then modify the grammar tree dynamically.

       _dyndoc     A  hash reference that lists interesting names for the section that should be documented. The
                   keys of the hash are the names and the values in the hash are strings  that  can  contain  an
                   explanation  for  the  name. The <b>_dyn()</b> subroutine is then called for each of these names and
                   the differences of the resulting grammar and the original one are documented. This module can
                   currently document differences in the _vars list, listing new variables and removed ones, and
                   differences in the _sections list, listing the new and removed sections.

       _recursive  Array containing the list of those sub-sections that are <u>recursive</u>, ie.  that can  contain  a
                   new sub-section with the same syntax as themselves.

                   The  same  effect  can  be  accomplished  with  circular  references in the grammar tree or a
                   suitable <b>_dyn</b> section  subroutine  (see  below},  so  this  facility  is  included  just  for
                   convenience.

   <b>Special</b> <b>Variable</b> <b>Keys</b>
       _dyn        A  subroutine  reference (function pointer) that will be called when the variable is assigned
                   some value in the config file. The subroutine will get  three  arguments:  the  name  of  the
                   variable,  the  value  assigned  and  a  reference to the grammar tree of this section.  This
                   subroutine can then modify the grammar tree dynamically.

                   Note that no <b>_dyn()</b> call is made for default and inherited values of the variable.

       _dyndoc     A hash reference that lists interesting values for the variable that  should  be  documented.
                   The  keys  of the hash are the values and the values in the hash are strings that can contain
                   an explanation for the value. The <b>_dyn()</b> subroutine is then called for each of  these  values
                   and the differences of the resulting grammar and the original one are documented. This module
                   can currently document differences in the _vars list, listing new variables and removed ones,
                   and differences in the _sections list, listing the new and removed sections.
