       DOM-ecmascript - XML::Grove and ECMA Script Language Binding

</pre><h4><b>XML::Grove</b> <b>and</b> <b>DOM</b> <b>Level</b> <b>One</b></h4><pre>
       XML::Grove is similar in concept to the ECMA Script Language Binding to DOM Level 1 Core (Appendix E of
       the DOM Recommendation).

       <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/</a> ecma-script-language-binding.html &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM</a>-
       Level-1/ecma-script-language-binding.html&gt;

       The ECMA Script Language Binding presents DOM properties as ECMA Script object properties.  The same is
       true for XML::Grove, XML::Grove presents DOM properties as Perl blessed hashes.

       The biggest difference between the ECMA Script Language Binding and XML::Grove is that XML::Grove uses a
       Perl hash for nodes, Perl arrays for NodeLists, Perl hashes for NamedNodeLists so those object classes
       don't exist in XML::Grove.  Because those classes don't exist, you use ordinary Perl syntax for
       manipulating the DOM properties (lists and named node lists) instead of methods like `"nextSibling()"' or
       `"replaceChild()"'.  Element attributes in XML::Grove are stored in Perl hashes; attribute types are
       available through the document object.

       Another difference is that XML::Grove attempts to marry the PerlSAX and DOM naming so that less (no?)
       name-changing occurs between using PerlSAX interfaces and filters and DOM modules.  Where conflicts
       occur, the PerlSAX naming is used.

       XML::Grove uses a blessed hash for nodes, so the node type is available using Perl's `"ref()"' instead of
       using a `"nodeType()"' method and all class names are prefixed with `"XML::Grove::"'.

       The following object descriptions are the most basic and common provided by many PerlSAX parsers.
       PerlSAX parsers often provide additional properties or objects, refer to your PerlSAX parser
       documentation for details.

</pre><h4><b>Document</b> <b>Object</b> <b>Model</b> <b>Level</b> <b>1</b> <b>Core</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Object</b> <b>XML::Grove::Document</b>
       Contents    The children of this object.  This property is an array.

       Entities    The  entities  declared  in  this  document.   This  property is a hash of XML::Grove::Entity
                   objects keyed by entity name.

       Notations   The notations declared in this document.  This property is  a  hash  of  XML::Grove::Notation
                   objects keyed by notation name.

   <b>Object</b> <b>XML::Grove::Element</b>
       Name        The tag type name for this element.  This property is a string.

       Attributes  The  attributes  for  this element.  This property is a hash and it's hash values are strings
                   (or arrays with some grove builders).

       Contents    The children of this object.  This property is an array of XML::Grove objects.

   <b>Object</b> <b>XML::Grove::Characters</b>
       Data        The text of the character data.  This property is a string.

   <b>Object</b> <b>XML::Grove::Comment</b>
       Data        The text of the character data.  This property is a string.

   <b>Object</b> <b>XML::Grove::CData</b>
       The "CData" object is called a "CDATASection" in DOM.

       Data        The text of the character data.  This property is a string.

   <b>Object</b> <b>XML::Grove::Notation</b>
       Name        The name of this notation.  This property is a string.

       SystemId    The system identifier of this notation.  This property is a string.

       PublicId    The public identifier of this notation.  This property is a string.

   <b>Object</b> <b>XML::Grove::Entity</b>
       Name        The name of this entity.  This property is a string.

       SystemId    The system identifier of this notation.  This property is a string.

       PublicId    The public identifier of this notation.  This property is a string.

       Notation    The notation declared for this entity.  This property is either the name of the notation as a
                   string or an "XML::Grove::Notation" object.

   <b>Object</b> <b>XML::Grove::PI</b>
       The "PI" object is called a "ProcessingInstruction" in DOM.

       Target      The target of the processing instruction.  This property is a string.

       Data        The text of the processing instruction.  This property is a string.
