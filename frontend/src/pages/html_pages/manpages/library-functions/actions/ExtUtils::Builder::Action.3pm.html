</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ExtUtils::Builder::Action - The ExtUtils::Builder Action role

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.017

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        $_-&gt;execute for @actions;

        open my $script, '&gt;', 'foo.sh';
        print $script shell_quote(@{$_}) for map { $_-&gt;to_command } @actions;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Actions are the cornerstone of the ExtUtils::Builder framework. They provide an interface between build
       tools (ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Build) and building extensions. This allows both sides to be
       completely independent from each other. It is a flexible abstraction around pieces of work, this work can
       be a piece of perl code, an external command, a mix of those or possibly other things.

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       An action can be consumed in many ways. It can be "execute"d, which is often the simplest way to deal
       with them. It can be serialized to commands that can be passed on to system or strings that can be
       "eval"led. If a consumer can deal with multiple of these, the "preference" method can be used to choose
       between options. On composite actions, "flatten" can be called to retrieve the constituent actions, on
       primitive actions it's just an identity operator. This is particularly useful before calling preference,
       because different sub-actions are likely to have different preferences.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>execute(%arguments)</b>
       Execute this action immediately. This may throw an exception on errors, but doesn't otherwise return
       anything. %arguments may be used by the command.

       â€¢   quiet

           If true, this suppresses logging.

   <b>to_command(%options)</b>
       Convert  the  action  into  a set of platform appropriate commands. It returns a list of array-refs, each
       array-ref being an individual command that  can  be  passes  to  "system"  or  equivalent.  %options  can
       influence  how  something  is serialized in action-type specific ways, but shouldn't fundamentally affect
       the action that is performed. All options are optional.

       perl
           This contains the path to the current perl interpreter.

       config
           This should contain an ExtUtils::Config object, or equivalent.

   <b>to_code(%options)</b>
       This returns a list of strings that can be evalled to sub-refs. %options can influence how  something  is
       serialized in action-type specific ways, but shouldn't fundamentally affect the action that is performed.

   <b>to_code_hash(%options)</b>
       This returns a list of hashes that can be used to create Action::Code objects.

   <b>preference(@possibilities)</b>
       This  action  returns  the  favored out of @possibilities. Valid values are "execute", "code", "command",
       "flatten". If no arguments are given, the favorite from all valid values is given.

   <b>flatten</b>
       This action returns all actions behind this action. It may return itself, it may return a  long  list  of
       actions, it may even return an empty list.
