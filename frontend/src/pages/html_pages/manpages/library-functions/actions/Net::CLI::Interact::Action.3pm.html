       Net::CLI::Interact::Action - Sent data or matched response from connected device

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class is used internally by Net::CLI::Interact and it's unlikely that an end-user will need to make
       use of Action objects directly. The interface is documented here as a matter of record.

       An Action object represents <u>either</u> some kind of text or command to send to a connected device, <u>or</u> a
       regular expression matching the response from a connected device. Such Actions are built up into
       ActionSets which describe a conversation with the connected device.

       If the Action is a "send" type, then after execution it can be cloned and augmented with the response
       text of the command. If the response is likely to be paged, then the Action may also store instruction in
       how to trigger and consume the pages.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>type</b>
       Denotes the kind of Action, which may be "send" or "match".

   <b>value</b>
       In the case of "send", a String command to send to the device. In the case of "match", a regular
       expression reference to match response from the device. In special circumstances an array reference of
       regular expression references is also valid, and each will be checked for a match against the device
       response.

   <b>no_ors</b>
       Only applies to the "send" kind. Whether to skip appending the <u>output</u> <u>record</u> <u>separator</u> (newline) to the
       "send" command when sent to the connected device.

   <b>continuation</b>
       Only applies to the "send" kind. When response output is likely to be paged, this stores an ActionSet
       that contains two Actions: one for the "match" which indicates output has paused at the end of a page,
       and one for the "send" command which triggers printing of the next page.

   <b>params</b>
       Only applies to the "send" kind, and contains a list of parameters which are substituted into the "value"
       using Perl's "sprintf" function. Insufficient parameters causes "sprintf" to die.

   <b>num_params</b>
       Only applies to the "send" kind, and returns the number of parameters which are required for the current
       "value". Used for error checking when setting "params".

   <b>response</b>
       A stash for the returned prompt which matched and triggered the end of this action.

   <b>response_stash</b>
       A stash for the returned output following a "send" command, but not including the matched prompt which
       ended the action. This slot is used by the "match" action as it slurps output, but the content is then
       transferred over to the partner "send" in the ActionSet.

   <b>prompt_hit</b>
       When a command is successfully issued, the response is terminated by a prompt.  However that prompt can
       be one of a list, defined in the Action. This slot records the regular expression from that list which
       was actually matched.

   <b>clone</b>
       Returns a new Action, which is a shallow clone of the existing one. All the reference based slots will
       share data, but you can add (for example) a "response" without affecting the original Action. Used when
       preparing to execute an Action which has been retrieved from the Phrasebook.
