       Catalyst::Action::DeserializeMultiPart - Deserialize Data in a Multipart Request

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package Foo::Controller::Bar;

           __PACKAGE__-&gt;config(
               # see Catalyst::Action::Deserialize for standard config
           );

           sub begin :ActionClass('DeserializeMultiPart') DeserializePart('REST') {}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This action will deserialize multipart HTTP POST, PUT, OPTIONS and DELETE requests.  It is a simple
       extension of Catalyst::Action::Deserialize with the exception that rather than using the entire request
       body (which may contain multiple sections), it will look for a single part in the request body named
       according to the "DeserializePart" attribute on that action (defaulting to "REST").  If a part is found
       under that name, it then proceeds to deserialize the request as normal based on the content-type of that
       individual part.  If no such part is found, the request would be processed as if no data was sent.

       This module's code will only come into play if the following conditions are met:

       •   The "Content-type" of the request is "multipart/*"

       •   The request body (as returned by "$c-"request-&gt;body&gt; is not defined

       •   There  is  a  part  of  the  request  body  (as  returned by "$c-"request-&gt;upload($DeserializePart)&gt;)
           available

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURING</b> <b>HTTP::Body</b></h4><pre>
       By   default,   HTTP::Body    parses    "multipart/*"    requests    as    an    HTTP::Body::OctetStream.
       HTTP::Body::OctetStream does not separate out the individual parts of the request body.  In order to make
       use of the individual parts, HTTP::Body must be told which content types to map to HTTP::Body::MultiPart.
       This  module  makes  the  assumption that you would like to have all "multipart/mixed" requests parsed by
       HTTP::Body::MultiPart module.  This is done by a package variable inside  HTTP::Body:  $HTTP::Body::Types
       (a HASH ref).

       <b>WARNING:</b>  As  this  module modifies the behaviour of HTTP::Body globally, adding it to an application can
       have unintended consequences as multipart bodies will be parsed differently from before.

       Feel free to add other content-types to this hash if needed or if you would prefer that "multipart/mixed"
       NOT be added to this hash, simply delete it after loading this module.

           # in your controller
           use Catalyst::Action::DeserializeMultiPart;

           delete $HTTP::Body::Types-&gt;{'multipart/mixed'};
           $HTTP::Body::Types-&gt;{'multipart/my-crazy-content-type'} = 'HTTP::Body::MultiPart';

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       This is a simple sub-class of Catalyst::Action::Deserialize.
