</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       signal — signal management

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/signal.h">signal.h</a>&gt;

       void (*signal(int <u>sig</u>, void (*<u>func</u>)(int)))(int);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  <u>signal</u>()  function  chooses  one  of  three  ways in which receipt of the signal number <u>sig</u> is to be
       subsequently handled. If the value of <u>func</u> is SIG_DFL, default handling for that signal shall occur.   If
       the  value of <u>func</u> is SIG_IGN, the signal shall be ignored.  Otherwise, the application shall ensure that
       <u>func</u> points to a function to be called when that signal occurs. An invocation of such a function  because
       of a signal, or (recursively) of any further functions called by that invocation (other than functions in
       the standard library), is called a ``signal handler''.

       When  a signal occurs, and <u>func</u> points to a function, it is implementation-defined whether the equivalent
       of a:

           signal(<u>sig</u>, SIG_DFL);

       is executed or the implementation prevents some implementation-defined set of signals (at least including
       <u>sig</u>) from occurring until the current signal handling has completed. (If the value of <u>sig</u> is SIGILL,  the
       implementation may alternatively define that no action is taken.) Next the equivalent of:

           (*func)(sig);

       is  executed. If and when the function returns, if the value of <u>sig</u> was SIGFPE, SIGILL, or SIGSEGV or any
       other implementation-defined value corresponding to a computational exception, the behavior is undefined.
       Otherwise, the program shall resume execution at the point it was interrupted. The ISO C standard  places
       a restriction on applications relating to the use of <u>raise</u>() from signal handlers.  This restriction does
       not  apply  to  POSIX applications, as POSIX.1‐2008 requires <u>raise</u>() to be async-signal-safe (see <u>Section</u>
       <u>2.4.3</u>, <u>Signal</u> <u>Actions</u>).

       If the process is multi-threaded, or if the process is single-threaded and a signal handler  is  executed
       other than as the result of:

        *  The process calling <u>abort</u>(), <u>raise</u>(), <u>kill</u>(), <u>pthread_kill</u>(), or <u>sigqueue</u>() to generate a signal that
           is not blocked

        *  A pending signal being unblocked and being delivered before the call that unblocked it returns

       the behavior is undefined if the signal handler refers to any object other than <u>errno</u> with static storage
       duration other than by assigning a value to an object declared as <b>volatile</b> <b>sig_atomic_t</b>, or if the signal
       handler  calls  any  function  defined in this standard other than one of the functions listed in <u>Section</u>
       <u>2.4</u>, <u>Signal</u> <u>Concepts</u>.

       At program start-up, the equivalent of:

           signal(<u>sig</u>, SIG_IGN);

       is executed for some signals, and the equivalent of:

           signal(<u>sig</u>, SIG_DFL);

       is executed for all other signals (see <u>exec</u>).

       The <u>signal</u>() function shall not change the setting of <u>errno</u> if successful.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       If the request can be honored, <u>signal</u>() shall return the value of  <u>func</u>  for  the  most  recent  call  to
       <u>signal</u>()  for  the specified signal <u>sig</u>.  Otherwise, SIG_ERR shall be returned and a positive value shall
       be stored in <u>errno</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>signal</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The <u>sig</u> argument is not a valid signal number or an attempt is made to catch a signal that  cannot
              be caught or ignore a signal that cannot be ignored.

       The <u>signal</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> An attempt was made to set the action to SIG_DFL for a signal that cannot be caught or ignored (or
              both).

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>sigaction</u>()  function  provides a more comprehensive and reliable mechanism for controlling signals;
       new applications should use <u>sigaction</u>() rather than <u>signal</u>().

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
