</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pthread_kill — send a signal to a thread

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/signal.h">signal.h</a>&gt;

       int pthread_kill(pthread_t <u>thread</u>, int <u>sig</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pthread_kill</u>() function shall request that a signal be delivered to the specified thread.

       As in <u>kill</u>(), if <u>sig</u> is zero, error checking shall be performed but no signal shall actually be sent.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful  completion,  the  function shall return a value of zero.  Otherwise, the function shall
       return an error number. If the <u>pthread_kill</u>() function fails, no signal shall be sent.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pthread_kill</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The value of the <u>sig</u> argument is an invalid or unsupported signal number.

       The <u>pthread_kill</u>() function shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pthread_kill</u>() function provides a mechanism for asynchronously directing a signal at a thread in the
       calling process. This could be used, for example, by one thread to affect broadcast delivery of a  signal
       to a set of threads.

       Note  that  <u>pthread_kill</u>()  only  causes the signal to be handled in the context of the given thread; the
       signal action (termination or stopping) affects the process as a whole.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       If an implementation detects use of a thread ID after the end of its lifetime, it is recommended that the
       function should fail and report an <b>[ESRCH]</b> error.

       Existing implementations vary on the result of a <u>pthread_kill</u>() with a thread ID indicating  an  inactive
       thread  (a terminated thread that has not been detached or joined). Some indicate success on such a call,
       while others give an error of <b>[ESRCH]</b>.  Since the  definition  of  thread  lifetime  in  this  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017  covers  inactive  threads, the <b>[ESRCH]</b> error as described is inappropriate in this case. In
       particular, this means that an application cannot have one thread check for termination of  another  with
       <u>pthread_kill</u>().

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A  future  version  of this standard may require that <u>pthread_kill</u>() not fail with <b>[ESRCH]</b> in the case of
       sending signals to an inactive thread (a terminated thread not yet detached or joined),  even  though  no
       signal will be delivered because the thread is no longer running.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
