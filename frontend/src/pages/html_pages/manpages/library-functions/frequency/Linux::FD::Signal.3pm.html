</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Linux::FD::Signal - Signal filehandles for Linux

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.017

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Linux::FD::Signal;

        my $fh = Linux::FD::Signal-&gt;new($sigset, @flags);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module creates a filehandle that can be used to accept signals targetted at the caller, similar but
       not identical to Signal::Pipe. It provides an alternative to conventional signal handlers or
       "sigwaitinfo", with the advantage that the file descriptor may easily be monitored by mechanisms such as
       "select", "poll", and "epoll".

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new($sigmask)</b>
       The $sigmask argument specifies the set of signals that the caller wishes to accept via the file
       descriptor. This should either be a signal name(without the "SIG" prefix) or a POSIX::SigSet object.
       Normally, the set of signals to be received via the file descriptor should be blocked to prevent the
       signals being handled according to their default dispositions. It is not possible to receive SIGKILL or
       SIGSTOP signals via a signalfd file descriptor; these signals are silently ignored if specified in
       $sigmask. @flags is an optional list of flags, currently limited to 'non-blocking' (requires Linux
       2.6.27).

   <b>set_mask($sigmask)</b>
       Sets the signal mask to a new value. Its argument works exactly the same as "new"'s

   <b>receive()</b>
       If one or more of the signals specified in mask is pending for the process, then it returns the
       information of one signalfd_siginfo structures (see below) that describe the signals.

       As a consequence of the receive, the signals are consumed, so that they are no longer pending for the
       process (i.e., will not be caught by signal handlers, and cannot be accepted using sigwaitinfo).

       If none of the signals in mask is pending for the process, then the receive either blocks until one of
       the signals in mask is generated for the process, or fails with the error "EAGAIN" if the file descriptor
       has been made non-blocking.

       The information is returned as a hashref with the following keys: "signo", "errno", "code", "pid", "uid",
       "fd", "tid", "band", "overrun", "trapno", "status", "int", "ptr", "utime", "stime", "address". All of
       these are returned as integers. Some of them are only useful in certain circumstances, others may not be
       useful from perl at all.
