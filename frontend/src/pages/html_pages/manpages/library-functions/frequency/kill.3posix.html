</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       kill — send a signal to a process or a group of processes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/signal.h">signal.h</a>&gt;

       int kill(pid_t <u>pid</u>, int <u>sig</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>kill</u>()  function  shall  send  a  signal to a process or a group of processes specified by <u>pid</u>.  The
       signal to be sent is specified by <u>sig</u> and is either one from the list given in <u>&lt;signal.h&gt;</u> or 0. If <u>sig</u> is
       0 (the null signal), error checking is performed but no signal is actually sent. The null signal  can  be
       used to check the validity of <u>pid</u>.

       For  a  process  to  have  permission to send a signal to a process designated by <u>pid</u>, unless the sending
       process has appropriate privileges, the real or effective user ID of the sending process shall match  the
       real or saved set-user-ID of the receiving process.

       If <u>pid</u> is greater than 0, <u>sig</u> shall be sent to the process whose process ID is equal to <u>pid</u>.

       If  <u>pid</u> is 0, <u>sig</u> shall be sent to all processes (excluding an unspecified set of system processes) whose
       process group ID is equal to the process group ID of the sender, and for which the process has permission
       to send a signal.

       If <u>pid</u> is -1, <u>sig</u> shall be sent to all processes (excluding an unspecified set of system  processes)  for
       which the process has permission to send that signal.

       If  <u>pid</u>  is  negative,  but  not  -1, <u>sig</u> shall be sent to all processes (excluding an unspecified set of
       system processes) whose process group ID is equal to the absolute value of <u>pid</u>, and for which the process
       has permission to send a signal.

       If the value of <u>pid</u> causes <u>sig</u> to be generated for the sending process, and if <u>sig</u> is not blocked for the
       calling thread and if no other thread has <u>sig</u> unblocked or is waiting in a <u>sigwait</u>()  function  for  <u>sig</u>,
       either  <u>sig</u>  or  at  least  one  pending unblocked signal shall be delivered to the sending thread before
       <u>kill</u>() returns.

       The user ID tests described above shall not be applied when sending SIGCONT to a process that is a member
       of the same session as the sending process.

       An implementation that provides extended security  controls  may  impose  further  implementation-defined
       restrictions on the sending of signals, including the null signal. In particular, the system may deny the
       existence of some or all of the processes specified by <u>pid</u>.

       The  <u>kill</u>()  function  is  successful  if  the process has permission to send <u>sig</u> to any of the processes
       specified by <u>pid</u>.  If <u>kill</u>() fails, no signal shall be sent.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise,  -1  shall  be  returned  and  <u>errno</u>  set  to
       indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>kill</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The value of the <u>sig</u> argument is an invalid or unsupported signal number.

       <b>EPERM</b>  The process does not have permission to send the signal to any receiving process.

       <b>ESRCH</b>  No process or process group can be found corresponding to that specified by <u>pid</u>.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The   semantics   for   permission  checking  for  <u>kill</u>()  differed  between  System  V  and  most  other
       implementations, such as Version 7 or 4.3 BSD. The semantics chosen for this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 agree
       with System V.  Specifically, a set-user-ID process cannot protect itself against signals  (or  at  least
       not  against  SIGKILL)  unless  it  changes  its real user ID.  This choice allows the user who starts an
       application to send it signals even if it changes its effective user ID.  The other semantics  give  more
       power to an application that wants to protect itself from the user who ran it.

       Some implementations provide semantic extensions to the <u>kill</u>() function when the absolute value of <u>pid</u> is
       greater than some maximum, or otherwise special, value. Negative values are a flag to <u>kill</u>().  Since most
       implementations  return  <b>[ESRCH]</b>  in  this  case,  this  behavior  is  not  included  in  this  volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, although a conforming implementation could provide such an extension.

       The unspecified processes to which a signal cannot be sent may include the scheduler or <u>init</u>.

       There was initially strong sentiment to specify that, if <u>pid</u> specifies that  a  signal  be  sent  to  the
       calling  process  and  that  signal is not blocked, that signal would be delivered before <u>kill</u>() returns.
       This would permit a process to call <u>kill</u>() and  be  guaranteed  that  the  call  never  return.  However,
       historical implementations that provide only the <u>signal</u>() function make only the weaker guarantee in this
       volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  because  they  only  deliver one signal each time a process enters the kernel.
       Modifications to such implementations to support the <u>sigaction</u>() function generally require entry to  the
       kernel  following  return  from  a  signal-catching  function,  in order to restore the signal mask. Such
       modifications have the effect of satisfying the stronger requirement, at least when <u>sigaction</u>() is  used,
       but  not  necessarily  when  <u>signal</u>()  is  used.  The  standard developers considered making the stronger
       requirement except when <u>signal</u>() is used, but felt this would be unnecessarily complex. Implementors  are
       encouraged to meet the stronger requirement whenever possible. In practice, the weaker requirement is the
       same,  except  in  the  rare case when two signals arrive during a very short window. This reasoning also
       applies to a similar requirement for <u>sigprocmask</u>().

       In 4.2 BSD, the SIGCONT signal can be sent to any  descendant  process  regardless  of  user-ID  security
       checks.   This  allows  a  job  control shell to continue a job even if processes in the job have altered
       their user IDs (as in the <u>su</u> command). In keeping with the addition of the concept of  sessions,  similar
       functionality  is  provided  by allowing the SIGCONT signal to be sent to any process in the same session
       regardless of user ID security checks. This is less restrictive than  BSD  in  the  sense  that  ancestor
       processes  (in  the same session) can now be the recipient.  It is more restrictive than BSD in the sense
       that descendant processes that form new sessions are now  subject  to  the  user  ID  checks.  A  similar
       relaxation  of  security  is  not  necessary  for  the  other job control signals since those signals are
       typically sent by the terminal driver in recognition of special  characters  being  typed;  the  terminal
       driver bypasses all security checks.

       In  secure  implementations,  a  process  may  be  restricted from sending a signal to a process having a
       different security label.  In order to prevent the existence or nonexistence of a process from being used
       as a covert channel, such processes should appear nonexistent to the sender; that is, <b>[ESRCH]</b>  should  be
       returned, rather than <b>[EPERM]</b>, if <u>pid</u> refers only to such processes.

       Historical  implementations  varied  on the result of a <u>kill</u>() with <u>pid</u> indicating a zombie process. Some
       indicated success on such a call (subject to permission checking), while others gave an error of <b>[ESRCH]</b>.
       Since the definition of process lifetime in this volume of  POSIX.1‐2017  covers  zombie  processes,  the
       <b>[ESRCH]</b>  error as described is inappropriate in this case and implementations that give this error do not
       conform. This means that an application  cannot  have  a  parent  process  check  for  termination  of  a
       particular child by sending it the null signal with <u>kill</u>(), but must instead use <u>waitpid</u>() or <u>waitid</u>().

       There  is  some  belief  that the name <u>kill</u>() is misleading, since the function is not always intended to
       cause process termination. However, the name is common to all historical implementations, and any  change
       would be in conflict with the goal of minimal changes to existing application code.
