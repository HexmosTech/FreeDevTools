</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       probe::signal.send.return - Signal being sent to a process completed (deprecated in SystemTap 2.1)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       signal.send.return

</pre><h4><b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>shared</u>
           Indicates whether the sent signal is shared by the thread group.

       <u>send2queue</u>
           Indicates whether the sent signal was sent to an existing sigqueue

       <u>retstr</u>
           The return value to either __group_send_sig_info, specific_send_sig_info, or send_sigqueue

       <u>name</u>
           The name of the function used to send out the signal

</pre><h4><b>CONTEXT</b></h4><pre>
       The signal's sender. (correct?)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Possible __group_send_sig_info and specific_send_sig_info return values are as follows;

       0 -- The signal is successfully sent to a process, which means that, (1) the signal was ignored by the
       receiving process, (2) this is a non-RT signal and the system already has one queued, and (3) the signal
       was successfully added to the sigqueue of the receiving process.

       -EAGAIN -- The sigqueue of the receiving process is overflowing, the signal was RT, and the signal was
       sent by a user using something other than <b>kill</b>.

       Possible send_group_sigqueue and send_sigqueue return values are as follows;

       0 -- The signal was either successfully added into the sigqueue of the receiving process, or a SI_TIMER
       entry is already queued (in which case, the overrun count will be simply incremented).

       1 -- The signal was ignored by the receiving process.

       -1 -- (send_sigqueue only) The task was marked exiting, allowing * posix_timer_event to redirect it to
       the group leader.
