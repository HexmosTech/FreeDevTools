</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sigwait — wait for queued signals

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/signal.h">signal.h</a>&gt;

       int sigwait(const sigset_t *restrict <u>set</u>, int *restrict <u>sig</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>sigwait</u>() function shall select a pending signal from <u>set</u>, atomically clear it from the system's set
       of pending signals, and return that signal number in the location referenced by <u>sig</u>.   If  prior  to  the
       call  to  <u>sigwait</u>() there are multiple pending instances of a single signal number, it is implementation-
       defined whether upon successful return there are any remaining pending signals for  that  signal  number.
       If the implementation supports queued signals and there are multiple signals queued for the signal number
       selected, the first such queued signal shall cause a return from <u>sigwait</u>() and the remainder shall remain
       queued.  If  no signal in <u>set</u> is pending at the time of the call, the thread shall be suspended until one
       or more becomes pending. The signals defined by <u>set</u> shall have been blocked at the time of  the  call  to
       <u>sigwait</u>();  otherwise,  the  behavior is undefined. The effect of <u>sigwait</u>() on the signal actions for the
       signals in <u>set</u> is unspecified.

       If more than one thread is using <u>sigwait</u>() to wait for the same signal, no more than one of these threads
       shall return from <u>sigwait</u>() with the signal number. If more than a single thread is blocked in  <u>sigwait</u>()
       for  a  signal  when  that  signal  is  generated for the process, it is unspecified which of the waiting
       threads returns from <u>sigwait</u>().  If the signal is generated for a specific thread, as by  <u>pthread_kill</u>(),
       only that thread shall return.

       Should any of the multiple pending signals in the range SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX be selected, it shall be the
       lowest  numbered  one. The selection order between realtime and non-realtime signals, or between multiple
       pending non-realtime signals, is unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, <u>sigwait</u>() shall store the  signal  number  of  the  received  signal  at  the
       location  referenced by <u>sig</u> and return zero. Otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
       error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>sigwait</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The <u>set</u> argument contains an invalid or unsupported signal number.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       To provide a convenient way for a thread to wait for a signal, this volume of POSIX.1‐2017  provides  the
       <u>sigwait</u>() function. For most cases where a thread has to wait for a signal, the <u>sigwait</u>() function should
       be quite convenient, efficient, and adequate.

       However,  requests  were made for a lower-level primitive than <u>sigwait</u>() and for semaphores that could be
       used by threads. After some consideration, threads were allowed to  use  semaphores  and  <u>sem_post</u>()  was
       defined to be async-signal-safe.

       In  summary,  when it is necessary for code run in response to an asynchronous signal to notify a thread,
       <u>sigwait</u>() should be used to handle the signal. Alternatively, if the implementation provides  semaphores,
       they  also  can  be  used, either following <u>sigwait</u>() or from within a signal handling routine previously
       registered with <u>sigaction</u>().
