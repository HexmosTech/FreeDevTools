       proc - Create a Tcl procedure

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>proc</b> <u>name</u> <u>args</u> <u>body</u>
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>proc</b>  command  creates  a  new Tcl procedure named <u>name</u>, replacing any existing command or procedure
       there may have been by that name.  Whenever the new command is invoked, the  contents  of  <u>body</u>  will  be
       executed  by  the  Tcl  interpreter.   Normally,  <u>name</u>  is unqualified (does not include the names of any
       containing namespaces), and the new procedure is created in the current namespace.  If <u>name</u> includes  any
       namespace  qualifiers,  the  procedure  is created in the specified namespace.  <u>Args</u> specifies the formal
       arguments to the procedure.  It consists of a list, possibly empty, each of whose elements specifies  one
       argument.   Each  argument  specifier  is  also a list with either one or two fields.  If there is only a
       single field in the specifier then it is the name of the argument; if there  are  two  fields,  then  the
       first  is  the argument name and the second is its default value.  Arguments with default values that are
       followed by non-defaulted arguments become required arguments; enough actual arguments must  be  supplied
       to allow all arguments up to and including the last required formal argument.

       When  <u>name</u> is invoked a local variable will be created for each of the formal arguments to the procedure;
       its value will be the value of corresponding argument in the invoking command or the  argument's  default
       value.   Actual  arguments  are  assigned  to formal arguments strictly in order.  Arguments with default
       values need not be specified in a procedure invocation.  However, there must be enough  actual  arguments
       for all the formal arguments that do not have defaults, and there must not be any extra actual arguments.
       Arguments  with  default  values  that  are  followed by non-defaulted arguments become de-facto required
       arguments, though this may change in a future version of  Tcl;  portable  code  should  ensure  that  all
       optional arguments come after all required arguments.

       There  is  one  special case to permit procedures with variable numbers of arguments.  If the last formal
       argument has the name “<b>args</b>”, then a call to the procedure may contain more  actual  arguments  than  the
       procedure has formal arguments.  In this case, all of the actual arguments starting at the one that would
       be  assigned to <b>args</b> are combined into a list (as if the <b>list</b> command had been used); this combined value
       is assigned to the local variable <b>args</b>.

       When <u>body</u> is being executed, variable  names  normally  refer  to  local  variables,  which  are  created
       automatically   when  referenced  and  deleted  when  the  procedure  returns.   One  local  variable  is
       automatically created for each of the procedure's arguments.  Other variables can  only  be  accessed  by
       invoking one of the <b>global</b>, <b>variable</b>, <b>upvar</b> or <b>namespace</b> <b>upvar</b> commands.  The current namespace when <u>body</u>
       is  executed  will be the namespace that the procedure's name exists in, which will be the namespace that
       it was created in unless it has been changed with <b>rename</b>.

       The <b>proc</b> command returns an empty string.  When a procedure is invoked, the procedure's return  value  is
       the  value specified in a <b>return</b> command.  If the procedure does not execute an explicit <b>return</b>, then its
       return value is the value of the last command executed in the procedure's body.  If an error occurs while
       executing the procedure body, then the procedure-as-a-whole will return that same error.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This is a procedure that takes two arguments and prints both their sum and their product. It also returns
       the string “OK” to the caller as an explicit result.

              <b>proc</b> printSumProduct {x y} {
                  set sum [expr {$x + $y}]
                  set prod [expr {$x * $y}]
                  puts "sum is $sum, product is $prod"
                  return "OK"
              }

       This is a procedure that accepts arbitrarily many arguments and prints them out, one by one.

              <b>proc</b> printArguments args {
                  foreach arg $args {
                      puts $arg
                  }
              }

       This procedure is a bit like the <b>incr</b> command, except it multiplies the contents of the named variable by
       the value, which defaults to <b>2</b>:

              <b>proc</b> mult {varName {multiplier 2}} {
                  upvar 1 $varName var
                  set var [expr {$var * $multiplier}]
              }
