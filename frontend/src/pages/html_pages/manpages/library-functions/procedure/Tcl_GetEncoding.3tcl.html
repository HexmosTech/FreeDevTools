                                                         is used.

       Tcl_Size <u>srcLen</u> (in)                              Length of <u>src</u> or <u>tsrc</u>  in  bytes.   If  the  length  is
                                                         negative, the encoding-specific length of the string is
                                                         used.

                                                         needs  to  occur  after  the last byte is converted and
                                                         then to reset to an initial  state.  The  <b>TCL_PROFILE_*</b>
                                                         bits  defined in the <b>PROFILES</b> section below control the
                                                         encoding profile to be used for  dealing  with  invalid

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       These   routines   convert   between  Tcl's  internal  character  representation,  UTF-8,  and  character
       representations used by various operating systems or file systems, such as Unicode, ASCII, or  Shift-JIS.
       When  operating  on  strings, such as such as obtaining the names of files or displaying characters using
       international fonts, the strings must be translated into  one  or  possibly  multiple  formats  that  the
       various  system  calls  can  use.   For  instance,  on a Japanese Unix workstation, a user might obtain a
       filename represented in the EUC-JP file encoding and then translate the characters to the  jisx0208  font
       encoding in order to display the filename in a Tk widget.  The purpose of the encoding package is to help
       bridge the translation gap.  UTF-8 provides an intermediate staging ground for all the various encodings.
       In  the  example  above,  text  would  be translated into UTF-8 from whatever file encoding the operating
       system is using.  Then it would be translated from UTF-8 into whatever font encoding the display routines
       require.

       Some basic encodings are compiled into Tcl.  Others can be defined by the user or dynamically loaded from
       encoding files in a platform-independent manner.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b> finds an encoding given its <u>name</u>.  The name may refer to a built-in Tcl encoding, a user-
       defined encoding registered by calling <b>Tcl_CreateEncoding</b>, or a dynamically-loadable encoding file.   The
       return  value  is  a token that represents the encoding and can be used in subsequent calls to procedures
       such as <b>Tcl_GetEncodingName</b>, <b>Tcl_FreeEncoding</b>, and <b>Tcl_UtfToExternal</b>.  If the name did not refer  to  any
       known or loadable encoding, NULL is returned and an error message is returned in <u>interp</u>.

       The  encoding  package  maintains  a  database of all encodings currently in use.  The first time <u>name</u> is
       seen, <b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b> returns an encoding with a reference count of 1.  If the  same  <u>name</u>  is  requested
       further  times,  then  the  reference  count  for  that  encoding  is incremented without the overhead of
       allocating a new encoding and all its associated data structures.

       When an <u>encoding</u> is no longer needed, <b>Tcl_FreeEncoding</b> should be called to release it.  When an  <u>encoding</u>
       is  no  longer  in  use  anywhere  (i.e.,  it  has  been  freed  as  many  times  as  it has been gotten)
       <b>Tcl_FreeEncoding</b> will release all storage the encoding was using and delete it from the database.

       <b>Tcl_GetEncodingFromObj</b> treats the string representation of <u>objPtr</u> as  an  encoding  name,  and  finds  an
       encoding with that name, just as <b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b> does. When an encoding is found, it is cached within the
       <b>objPtr</b>  value  for  future  reference,  the  <b>Tcl_Encoding</b>  token  is written to the storage pointed to by
       <u>encodingPtr</u>, and the value <b>TCL_OK</b> is returned. If no such encoding  is  found,  the  value  <b>TCL_ERROR</b>  is
       returned,  and  no  writing  to <b>*</b><u>encodingPtr</u> takes place. Just as with <b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b>, the caller should
       call <b>Tcl_FreeEncoding</b> on the resulting encoding token when that token will no longer be used.

       <b>Tcl_ExternalToUtfDString</b> converts a source buffer <u>src</u>  from  the  specified  <u>encoding</u>  into  UTF-8.   The
       converted  bytes  are stored in <u>dstPtr</u>, which is then null-terminated.  The caller should eventually call
       <b>Tcl_DStringFree</b> to free any information stored in <u>dstPtr</u>.  When converting, if any of the  characters  in
       the  source  buffer  cannot  be  represented in the target encoding, a default fallback character will be
       used.  The return value is a pointer to the value stored in the DString.

       <b>Tcl_ExternalToUtfDStringEx</b> is a more flexible version  of  older  <b>Tcl_ExternalToUtfDString</b>  function.  It
       takes  three  additional  parameters,  <b>interp</b>,  <b>flags</b> and <b>errorIdxPtr</b>. The <b>flags</b> parameter may be used to
       specify the profile to be used for the transform. The <b>TCL_ENCODING_START</b>  and  <b>TCL_ENCODING_END</b>  bits  in
       <b>flags</b>  are  ignored  as  the  function  assumes the entire source string to be decoded is passed into the
       function. On success, the function returns <b>TCL_OK</b> with the converted string stored in <b>*dstPtr</b>. For errors
       <u>other</u> <u>than</u> <u>conversion</u> <u>errors</u>, such as invalid flags, the function returns <b>TCL_ERROR</b> with an error message
       in <b>interp</b> if it is not NULL.  For  conversion  errors,  <b>Tcl_ExternalToUtfDStringEx</b>  returns  one  of  the
       <b>TCL_CONVERT_*</b>  errors  listed  below  for  <b>Tcl_ExternalToUtf</b>.   When  one  of  these conversion errors is
       returned, an error message is stored in <b>interp</b> only if <b>errorIdxPtr</b> is NULL. Otherwise, no  error  message
       is  stored  as  the  function  expects the caller is interested the decoded data up to that point and not
       treating this as  an  immediate  error  condition.   The  index  of  the  error  location  is  stored  in
       <b>*errorIdxPtr</b>.

       The  caller  must  call <b>Tcl_DStringFree</b> to free up the <b>*dstPtr</b> resources irrespective of the return value
       from the function.

       <b>Tcl_ExternalToUtf</b> converts a source buffer <u>src</u> from the specified <u>encoding</u>  into  UTF-8.   Up  to  <u>srcLen</u>
       bytes  are  converted  from the source buffer and up to <u>dstLen</u> converted bytes are stored in <u>dst</u>.  In all
       cases, <u>*srcReadPtr</u> is filled with the number of bytes that  were  successfully  converted  from  <u>src</u>  and
       <u>*dstWrotePtr</u>  is filled with the corresponding number of bytes that were stored in <u>dst</u>.  The return value
       is one of the following:

              <b>TCL_OK</b>                       All bytes of <u>src</u> were converted.

              <b>TCL_CONVERT_NOSPACE</b>          The destination buffer was not large enough for all of the  converted
                                           data; as many characters as could fit were converted though.

              <b>TCL_CONVERT_MULTIBYTE</b>        The  last  few  bytes  in  the  source buffer were the beginning of a
                                           multibyte sequence, but more  bytes  were  needed  to  complete  this
                                           sequence.   A subsequent call to the conversion routine should pass a
                                           buffer containing the unconverted bytes that  remained  in  <u>src</u>  plus
                                           some  further  bytes  from  the source stream to properly convert the
                                           formerly split-up multibyte sequence.

              <b>TCL_CONVERT_SYNTAX</b>           The source buffer contained an invalid byte  or  character  sequence.
                                           This  may  occur if the input stream has been damaged or if the input
                                           encoding method was misidentified.

              <b>TCL_CONVERT_UNKNOWN</b>          The source buffer contained a character that could not be represented
                                           in the target encoding.

       <b>Tcl_UtfToExternalDString</b> converts a source buffer <u>src</u>  from  UTF-8  into  the  specified  <u>encoding</u>.   The
       converted  bytes  are  stored  in <u>dstPtr</u>, which is then terminated with the appropriate encoding-specific
       null.  The caller should eventually call <b>Tcl_DStringFree</b> to free any information stored in <u>dstPtr</u>.   When
       converting, if any of the characters in the source buffer cannot be represented in the target encoding, a
       default  fallback  character  will  be  used.   The  return value is a pointer to the value stored in the
       DString.

       <b>Tcl_UtfToExternalDStringEx</b> is an enhanced  version  of  <b>Tcl_UtfToExternalDString</b>  that  transforms  UTF-8
       encoded  source  data  to a specified <u>encoding</u>. Except for the direction of the transform, the parameters
       and return values are identical to those of  <b>Tcl_ExternalToUtfDStringEx</b>.  See  that  function  above  for
       details about the same.

       Irrespective of the return code from the function, the caller must free resources associated with <b>*dstPtr</b>
       when the function returns.

       <b>Tcl_UtfToExternal</b>  converts  a  source  buffer  <u>src</u> from UTF-8 into the specified <u>encoding</u>.  Up to <u>srcLen</u>
       bytes are converted from the source buffer and up to <u>dstLen</u> converted bytes are stored in  <u>dst</u>.   In  all
       cases,  <u>*srcReadPtr</u>  is  filled  with  the  number of bytes that were successfully converted from <u>src</u> and
       <u>*dstWrotePtr</u> is filled with the corresponding number of bytes that were stored in <u>dst</u>.  The return values
       are the same as the return values for <b>Tcl_ExternalToUtf</b>.

       <b>Tcl_GetEncodingName</b> is roughly the inverse of <b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b>.  Given an <u>encoding</u>, the  return  value  is
       the  <u>name</u>  argument  that was used to create the encoding.  The string returned by <b>Tcl_GetEncodingName</b> is
       only guaranteed to persist until the <u>encoding</u> is deleted.  The caller must not modify this string.

       <b>Tcl_GetEncodingNulLength</b> returns the length of the terminating nul  byte  sequence  for  strings  in  the
       specified encoding.

       <b>Tcl_SetSystemEncoding</b> sets the default encoding that should be used whenever the user passes a NULL value
       for  the  <u>encoding</u> argument to any of the other encoding functions.  If <u>name</u> is NULL, the system encoding
       is reset to the default system encoding, <b>binary</b>.  If the name did not refer  to  any  known  or  loadable
       encoding,  <b>TCL_ERROR</b>  is  returned  and  an  error  message is left in <u>interp</u>.  Otherwise, this procedure
       increments the reference count of the new system encoding, decrements the  reference  count  of  the  old
       system encoding, and returns <b>TCL_OK</b>.

       <b>Tcl_GetEncodingNameFromEnvironment</b>  provides  a  means for the Tcl library to report the encoding name it
       believes to be the correct one to use as the system encoding, based on system calls  and  examination  of
       the  environment  suitable  for  the platform.  It accepts <u>bufPtr</u>, a pointer to an uninitialized or freed
       <b>Tcl_DString</b> and writes the encoding name to it.  The <b>Tcl_DStringValue</b> is returned.

       <b>Tcl_GetEncodingNames</b> sets the <u>interp</u> result to a list consisting of the names of all the  encodings  that
       are  currently  defined  or  can  be  dynamically  loaded,  searching  the  encoding  path  specified  by
       <b>Tcl_SetEncodingSearchPath</b>.  This procedure does not ensure that the dynamically-loadable  encoding  files
       contain valid data, but merely that they exist.

       <b>Tcl_CreateEncoding</b>  defines a new encoding and registers the C procedures that are called back to convert
       between the encoding and UTF-8.  Encodings created by <b>Tcl_CreateEncoding</b> are thereafter  visible  in  the
       database  used  by  <b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b>.   Just  as with the <b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b> procedure, the return value is a
       token that represents the encoding and can be used in  subsequent  calls  to  other  encoding  functions.
       <b>Tcl_CreateEncoding</b>  returns  an  encoding  with a reference count of 1. If an encoding with the specified
       <u>name</u> already exists, then its entry in the database is replaced with the new encoding; the token for  the
       old encoding will remain valid and continue to behave as before, but users of the new token will now call
       the new encoding procedures.

       The  <u>typePtr</u>  argument  to <b>Tcl_CreateEncoding</b> contains information about the name of the encoding and the
       procedures that will be called to convert between this encoding and UTF-8.  It is defined as follows:

              typedef struct {
                  const char *<u>encodingName</u>;
                  Tcl_EncodingConvertProc *<u>toUtfProc</u>;
                  Tcl_EncodingConvertProc *<u>fromUtfProc</u>;
                  Tcl_EncodingFreeProc *<u>freeProc</u>;
                  void *<u>clientData</u>;
                  Tcl_Size <u>nullSize</u>;
              } <b>Tcl_EncodingType</b>;

       The <u>encodingName</u> provides a string name for the encoding, by which it can be referred in other procedures
       such as <b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b>.  The <u>toUtfProc</u> refers to a callback procedure to invoke  to  convert  text  from
       this  encoding into UTF-8.  The <u>fromUtfProc</u> refers to a callback procedure to invoke to convert text from
       UTF-8 into this encoding.  The <u>freeProc</u> refers to a callback procedure to invoke when  this  encoding  is
       deleted.   The <u>freeProc</u> field may be NULL.  The <u>clientData</u> contains an arbitrary one-word value passed to
       <u>toUtfProc</u>, <u>fromUtfProc</u>, and <u>freeProc</u> whenever they are called.  Typically, this is a pointer  to  a  data
       structure  containing  encoding-specific  information  that  can be used by the callback procedures.  For
       instance, two very similar encodings such as <b>ascii</b> and <b>macRoman</b> may use the same callback procedure,  but
       use  different  values  of <u>clientData</u> to control its behavior.  The <u>nullSize</u> specifies the number of zero
       bytes that signify end-of-string in this encoding.  It must be <b>1</b> (for single-byte or multi-byte encodings
       like ASCII or Shift-JIS) or <b>2</b> (for double-byte encodings like Unicode).  Constant-sized encodings with  3
       or more bytes per character (such as CNS11643) are not accepted.

       The callback procedures <u>toUtfProc</u> and <u>fromUtfProc</u> should match the type <b>Tcl_EncodingConvertProc</b>:

              typedef int <b>Tcl_EncodingConvertProc</b>(
                      void *<u>clientData</u>,
                      const char *<u>src</u>,
                      int <u>srcLen</u>,
                      int <u>flags</u>,
                      Tcl_EncodingState *<u>statePtr</u>,
                      char *<u>dst</u>,
                      int <u>dstLen</u>,
                      int *<u>srcReadPtr</u>,
                      int *<u>dstWrotePtr</u>,
                      int *<u>dstCharsPtr</u>);

       The  <u>toUtfProc</u> and <u>fromUtfProc</u> procedures are called by the <b>Tcl_ExternalToUtf</b> or <b>Tcl_UtfToExternal</b> family
       of functions to perform the actual conversion.  The <u>clientData</u> parameter to these procedures is the  same
       as  the  <u>clientData</u>  field  specified to <b>Tcl_CreateEncoding</b> when the encoding was created.  The remaining
       arguments to the callback  procedures  are  the  same  as  the  arguments,  documented  at  the  top,  to
       <b>Tcl_ExternalToUtf</b>  or <b>Tcl_UtfToExternal</b>, with the following exceptions.  If the <u>srcLen</u> argument to one of
       those high-level functions is  negative,  the  value  passed  to  the  callback  procedure  will  be  the
       appropriate  encoding-specific  string  length  of  <u>src</u>.   If  any  of  the  <u>srcReadPtr</u>,  <u>dstWrotePtr</u>, or
       <u>dstCharsPtr</u> arguments to one of the high-level functions is NULL, the corresponding value passed  to  the
       callback procedure will be a non-NULL location.

       The callback procedure <u>freeProc</u>, if non-NULL, should match the type <b>Tcl_EncodingFreeProc</b>:

              typedef void <b>Tcl_EncodingFreeProc</b>(
                      void *<u>clientData</u>);

       This  <u>freeProc</u>  function is called when the encoding is deleted.  The <u>clientData</u> parameter is the same as
       the <u>clientData</u> field specified to <b>Tcl_CreateEncoding</b> when the encoding was created.

       <b>Tcl_GetEncodingSearchPath</b> and <b>Tcl_SetEncodingSearchPath</b>  are  called  to  access  and  set  the  list  of
       filesystem directories searched for encoding data files.

       The  value  returned  by  <b>Tcl_GetEncodingSearchPath</b>  is  the  value stored by the last successful call to
       <b>Tcl_SetEncodingSearchPath</b>.  If no calls to <b>Tcl_SetEncodingSearchPath</b> have occurred, Tcl will  compute  an
       initial value based on the environment.  There is one encoding search path for the entire process, shared
       by all threads in the process.

       <b>Tcl_SetEncodingSearchPath</b>  stores  <u>searchPath</u>  and  returns  <b>TCL_OK</b>, unless <u>searchPath</u> is not a valid Tcl
       list, which causes <b>TCL_ERROR</b> to be returned.  The elements of <u>searchPath</u> are  not  verified  as  existing
       readable filesystem directories.  When searching for encoding data files takes place, and non-existent or
       non-readable filesystem directories on the <u>searchPath</u> are silently ignored.

</pre><h4><b>ENCODING</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Space  would  prohibit  precompiling  into  Tcl  every possible encoding algorithm, so many encodings are
       stored on disk as dynamically-loadable encoding files.  This behavior also  allows  the  user  to  create
       additional  encoding  files  that  can  be loaded using the same mechanism.  These encoding files contain
       information about the tables and/or escape sequences  used  to  map  between  an  external  encoding  and
       Unicode.  The external encoding may consist of single-byte, multi-byte, or double-byte characters.

       Each  dynamically-loadable  encoding  is  represented  as  a  text  file.   The initial line of the file,
       beginning with a “#” symbol, is a comment that provides a human-readable description of  the  file.   The
       next line identifies the type of encoding file.  It can be one of the following letters:

       [1] <b>S</b>  A  single-byte  encoding, where one character is always one byte long in the encoding.  An example
              is <b>iso8859-1</b>, used by many European languages.

       [2] <b>D</b>  A double-byte encoding, where one character is always two bytes long in the encoding.  An  example
              is <b>big5</b>, used for Chinese text.

       [3] <b>M</b>  A multi-byte encoding, where one character may be either one or two bytes long.  Certain bytes are
              lead bytes, indicating that another byte must follow and that together the two bytes represent one
              character.  Other bytes are not lead bytes and represent themselves.  An example is <b>shiftjis</b>, used
              by many Japanese computers.

       [4] <b>E</b>  An  escape-sequence  encoding,  specifying  that  certain  sequences  of  bytes  do  not represent
              characters, but commands that describe how following bytes should be interpreted.

       The rest of the lines in the file depend on the type.

       Cases [1], [2], and [3] are collectively referred to as table-based  encoding  files.   The  lines  in  a
       table-based  encoding  file are in the same format as this example taken from the <b>shiftjis</b> encoding (this
       is not the complete file):

       The third line of the file is three numbers.  The first number is the fallback character (in base 16)  to
       use  when  converting  from UTF-8 to this encoding.  The second number is a <b>1</b> if this file represents the
       encoding for a symbol font, or <b>0</b> otherwise.  The last number (in base 10)  is  how  many  pages  of  data
       follow.

       Subsequent  lines  in  the example above are pages that describe how to map from the encoding into 2-byte
       Unicode.  The first line in a page identifies the page number.  Following it are 256 double-byte numbers,
       arranged as 16 rows of 16 numbers.  Given a character in the encoding, the high byte of that character is
       used to select which page, and the low byte of that character is used as an index to select  one  of  the
       double-byte  numbers  in  that  page  - the value obtained being the corresponding Unicode character.  By
       examination of the example above, one can see that the characters 0x7E and 0x8163 in <b>shiftjis</b> map to 203E
       and 2026 in Unicode, respectively.

       Following the first page will be all the other pages, each in the same format as the  first:  one  number
       identifying the page followed by 256 double-byte Unicode characters.  If a character in the encoding maps
       to the Unicode character 0000, it means that the character does not actually exist.  If all characters on
       a page would map to 0000, that page can be omitted.

       Case  [4] is the escape-sequence encoding file.  The lines in an this type of file are in the same format
       as this example taken from the <b>iso2022-jp</b> encoding:

              # Encoding file: iso2022-jp, escape-driven
              E
              init           {}
              final          {}
              iso8859-1      \x1B(B
              jis0201        \x1B(J

       In the file, the first column represents an option and the second column is the associated  value.   <b>init</b>
       is a string to emit or expect before the first character is converted, while <b>final</b> is a string to emit or
       expect  after  the  last character.  All other options are names of table-based encodings; the associated
       value is the escape-sequence that marks that encoding.  Tcl syntax is used for the values; in  the  above
       example, for instance, “<b>{}</b>” represents the empty string and “<b>\x1B</b>” represents character 27.

       When  <b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b>  encounters  an  encoding  <u>name</u>  that  has  not been loaded, it attempts to load an
       encoding file called <u>name</u><b>.enc</b> from the <b>encoding</b> subdirectory of each directory that Tcl searches for  its
       script library.  If the encoding file exists, but is malformed, an error message will be left in <u>interp</u>.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCE</b> <b>COUNT</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tcl_GetEncodingFromObj</b>  does  not  modify the reference count of its <u>objPtr</u> argument; it only reads. Note
       however that this function may set the interpreter result; if that is the only place that  is  holding  a
       reference to the object, it will be deleted.

       <b>Tcl_GetEncodingSearchPath</b> returns an object with a reference count of at least 1.

</pre><h4><b>PROFILES</b></h4><pre>
       Encoding  profiles  define  the  manner  in  which  errors  in the encoding transforms are handled by the
       encoding functions. An application can specify the profile to be  used  by  OR-ing  the  <b>flags</b>  parameter
       passed  to  the  function  with  at most one of <b>TCL_ENCODING_PROFILE_TCL8</b>, <b>TCL_ENCODING_PROFILE_STRICT</b> or
       <b>TCL_ENCODING_PROFILE_REPLACE</b>.  These correspond to the <b>tcl8</b>, <b>strict</b> and <b>replace</b> profiles respectively. If
       none are specified, a version-dependent default profile is used.  For Tcl 9.0,  the  default  profile  is
       <b>strict</b>.

       For details about profiles, see the <b>PROFILES</b> section in the documentation of the <b>encoding</b> command.
