</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mlock, munlock — lock or unlock a range of process address space (<b>REALTIME</b>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

       int mlock(const void *<u>addr</u>, size_t <u>len</u>);
       int munlock(const void *<u>addr</u>, size_t <u>len</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>mlock</u>()  function  shall  cause  those  whole  pages containing any part of the address space of the
       process starting at address <u>addr</u> and continuing for <u>len</u> bytes to be  memory-resident  until  unlocked  or
       until  the  process  exits  or <u>exec</u>s another process image. The implementation may require that <u>addr</u> be a
       multiple of {PAGESIZE}.

       The <u>munlock</u>() function shall unlock those whole pages containing any part of the  address  space  of  the
       process  starting  at address <u>addr</u> and continuing for <u>len</u> bytes, regardless of how many times <u>mlock</u>() has
       been called by the process for any of the pages in the specified range. The  implementation  may  require
       that <u>addr</u> be a multiple of {PAGESIZE}.

       If any of the pages in the range specified to a call to <u>munlock</u>() are also mapped into the address spaces
       of other processes, any locks established on those pages by another process are unaffected by the call of
       this  process  to  <u>munlock</u>().  If any of the pages in the range specified by a call to <u>munlock</u>() are also
       mapped into other portions of the address space of the calling process outside the range  specified,  any
       locks established on those pages via the other mappings are also unaffected by this call.

       Upon  successful  return  from <u>mlock</u>(), pages in the specified range shall be locked and memory-resident.
       Upon successful return from <u>munlock</u>(), pages in the specified range shall be unlocked with respect to the
       address space of the process. Memory residency of unlocked pages is unspecified.

       Appropriate privileges are required to lock process memory with <u>mlock</u>().

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <u>mlock</u>() and <u>munlock</u>() functions shall return a value of zero.  Otherwise,
       no change is made to any locks in the address space of the process, and the function shall return a value
       of -1 and set <u>errno</u> to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>mlock</u>() and <u>munlock</u>() functions shall fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM</b> Some  or  all  of the address range specified by the <u>addr</u> and <u>len</u> arguments does not correspond to
              valid mapped pages in the address space of the process.

       The <u>mlock</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> Some or all of the memory identified by the operation could not be locked when the call was made.

       The <u>mlock</u>() and <u>munlock</u>() functions may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The <u>addr</u> argument is not a multiple of {PAGESIZE}.

       The <u>mlock</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM</b> Locking the pages mapped by the specified range would exceed an  implementation-defined  limit  on
              the amount of memory that the process may lock.

       <b>EPERM</b>  The calling process does not have appropriate privileges to perform the requested operation.
