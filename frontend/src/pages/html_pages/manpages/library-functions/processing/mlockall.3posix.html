</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mlockall, munlockall — lock/unlock the address space of a process (<b>REALTIME</b>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

       int mlockall(int <u>flags</u>);
       int munlockall(void);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>mlockall</u>()  function  shall  cause  all  of the pages mapped by the address space of a process to be
       memory-resident until unlocked or until the process exits or  <u>exec</u>s  another  process  image.  The  <u>flags</u>
       argument determines whether the pages to be locked are those currently mapped by the address space of the
       process,  those  that  are  mapped  in  the  future,  or both. The <u>flags</u> argument is constructed from the
       bitwise-inclusive OR of one or more of the following symbolic constants, defined in <u>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</u>:

       MCL_CURRENT Lock all of the pages currently mapped into the address space of the process.

       MCL_FUTURE  Lock all of the pages that become mapped into the address space of the process in the future,
                   when those mappings are established.

       If MCL_FUTURE is specified, and the automatic locking of future mappings eventually causes the amount  of
       locked  memory  to  exceed  the  amount  of available physical memory or any other implementation-defined
       limit, the behavior is implementation-defined.  The  manner  in  which  the  implementation  informs  the
       application of these situations is also implementation-defined.

       The  <u>munlockall</u>()  function  shall unlock all currently mapped pages of the address space of the process.
       Any pages that become mapped into the address space of the process after a call to <u>munlockall</u>() shall not
       be locked, unless there is an intervening call to <u>mlockall</u>() specifying MCL_FUTURE or a  subsequent  call
       to  <u>mlockall</u>()  specifying  MCL_CURRENT.  If  pages mapped into the address space of the process are also
       mapped into the address spaces  of  other  processes  and  are  locked  by  those  processes,  the  locks
       established by the other processes shall be unaffected by a call by this process to <u>munlockall</u>().

       Upon  successful  return  from  the  <u>mlockall</u>() function that specifies MCL_CURRENT, all currently mapped
       pages of the address space of the process shall be memory-resident and  locked.   Upon  return  from  the
       <u>munlockall</u>()  function,  all currently mapped pages of the address space of the process shall be unlocked
       with respect to the address space of the process.  The memory residency of unlocked pages is unspecified.

       Appropriate privileges are required to lock process memory with <u>mlockall</u>().

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, the  <u>mlockall</u>()  function  shall  return  a  value  of  zero.  Otherwise,  no
       additional  memory shall be locked, and the function shall return a value of -1 and set <u>errno</u> to indicate
       the error. The effect of failure of <u>mlockall</u>() on previously existing  locks  in  the  address  space  is
       unspecified.

       If  it is supported by the implementation, the <u>munlockall</u>() function shall always return a value of zero.
       Otherwise, the function shall return a value of -1 and set <u>errno</u> to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>mlockall</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> Some or all of the memory identified by the operation could not be locked when the call was made.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The <u>flags</u> argument is zero, or includes unimplemented flags.

       The <u>mlockall</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM</b> Locking all of the pages currently mapped into the address space of the process  would  exceed  an
              implementation-defined limit on the amount of memory that the process may lock.

       <b>EPERM</b>  The calling process does not have appropriate privileges to perform the requested operation.
