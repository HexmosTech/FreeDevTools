</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>MPI_Dist_graph_create</u> creates a new communicator <u>comm_dist_graph</u>  with  distributed  graph  topology  and
       returns a handle to the new communicator.  The number of processes in <u>comm_dist_graph</u> is identical to the
       number  of  processes  in <u>comm_old</u>. Concretely, each process calls the constructor with a set of directed
       (source,destination) communication edges as described below. Every process passes an array  of  <u>n</u>  source
       nodes in the <u>sources</u> array. For each source node, a non-negative number of destination nodes is specified
       in  the  <u>degrees</u>  array. The destination nodes are stored in the corresponding consecutive segment of the
       <u>destinations</u> array. More precisely, if the i-th node in sources is s,  this  specifies  <u>degrees</u>[i]  <u>edges</u>
       (s,d)  with  d  of  the j-th such edge stored in <u>destinations</u>[<u>degrees</u>[0]+…+<u>degrees</u>[i-1]+j]. The weight of
       this edge is stored in <u>weights</u>[<u>degrees</u>[0]+…+<u>degrees</u>[i-1]+j]. Both the <u>sources</u> and the <u>destinations</u> arrays
       may contain the same node more than once, and the order in which nodes  are  listed  as  destinations  or
       sources  is  not  signicant.  Similarly,  different  processes may specify edges with the same source and
       destination nodes. Source and destination nodes must be process ranks of  comm_old.  Different  processes
       may specify different numbers of source and destination nodes, as well as different source to destination
       edges.  This  allows  a  fully  distributed  specification of the communication graph. Isolated processes
       (i.e., processes with no outgoing or incoming edges, that is, processes that do not occur  as  source  or
       destination  node  in  the  graph  specification)  are  allowed.  The  call  to  <u>MPI_Dist_graph_create</u> is
       collective.

       If reorder = false, all processes will have the same rank in comm_dist_graph as in comm_old. If reorder =
       true then the MPI library is free to  remap  to  other  processes  (of  comm_old)  in  order  to  improve
       communication  on the edges of the communication graph. The weight associated with each edge is a hint to
       the MPI library about the amount or intensity of communication on that edge, and may be used to compute a

</pre><h4><b>WEIGHTS</b></h4><pre>
       Weights are specified as non-negative integers and  can  be  used  to  influence  the  process  remapping
       strategy  and  other  internal  MPI  optimizations.  For  instance,  approximate count arguments of later
       communication calls along specific edges could be used as their edge weights. Multiplicity of  edges  can
       likewise  indicate  more  intense communication between pairs of processes. However, the exact meaning of
       edge weights is not specified by the MPI standard and is left to the implementation. An  application  can
       supply  the  special  value  MPI_UNWEIGHTED for the weight array to indicate that all edges have the same
       (effectively no) weight. It is erroneous to supply MPI_UNWEIGHTED for  some  but  not  all  processes  of
       comm_old. If the graph is weighted but <u>n</u> = 0, then MPI_WEIGHTS_EMPTY or any arbitrary array may be passed
       to weights. Note that MPI_UNWEIGHTED and MPI_WEIGHTS_EMPTY are not special weight values; rather they are
       special values for the total array argument. In Fortran, MPI_UNWEIGHTED and MPI_WEIGHTS_EMPTY are objects
       like MPI_BOTTOM (not usable for initialization or assignment). See MPI-3 section 2.5.4.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Almost  all  MPI  routines  return  an  error  value; C routines as the return result of the function and
       Fortran routines in the last argument.

       Before the error value is returned, the current MPI  error  handler  associated  with  the  communication
       object  (e.g.,  communicator, window, file) is called.  If no communication object is associated with the
       MPI call, then the call is considered attached to MPI_COMM_SELF and will call the  associated  MPI  error
       handler.   When   MPI_COMM_SELF   is   not  initialized  (i.e.,  before  <u>MPI_Init</u>/<u>MPI_Init_thread</u>,  after
       <u>MPI_Finalize</u>, or when using the Sessions Model exclusively) the error raises the initial  error  handler.
       The  initial  error handler can be changed by calling <u>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</u> on MPI_COMM_SELF when using
       the World model, or the mpi_initial_errhandler CLI argument to mpiexec or info  key  to  <u>MPI_Comm_spawn</u>/‐
       <u>MPI_Comm_spawn_multiple</u>.   If no other appropriate error handler has been set, then the MPI_ERRORS_RETURN
       error handler is called for MPI I/O functions and the MPI_ERRORS_ABORT error handler is  called  for  all
       other MPI functions.

       Open MPI includes three predefined error handlers that can be used:

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL</b> Causes the program to abort all connected MPI processes.

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_ABORT</b> An error handler that can be invoked on a communicator, window, file, or session. When
         called  on  a  communicator,  it  acts  as if <u>MPI_Abort</u> was called on that communicator. If called on a
         window or file, acts as if <u>MPI_Abort</u> was called on a communicator containing the group of processes  in
         the corresponding window or file. If called on a session, aborts only the local process.

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_RETURN</b> Returns an error code to the application.

       MPI applications can also implement their own error handlers by calling:

       • <u>MPI_Comm_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</u>

       • <u>MPI_File_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_File_set_errhandler</u>

       • <u>MPI_Session_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Session_set_errhandler</u> or at <u>MPI_Session_init</u>

       • <u>MPI_Win_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Win_set_errhandler</u>

       Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.

       See the <u>MPI</u> <u>man</u> <u>page</u> for a full list of <u>MPI</u> <u>error</u> <u>codes</u>.

       See the Error Handling section of the MPI-3.1 standard for more information.
