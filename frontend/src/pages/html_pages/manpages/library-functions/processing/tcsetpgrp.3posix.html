</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tcsetpgrp — set the foreground process group ID

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;

       int tcsetpgrp(int <u>fildes</u>, pid_t <u>pgid_id</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  process  has  a  controlling  terminal,  <u>tcsetpgrp</u>()  shall  set the foreground process group ID
       associated with the terminal to <u>pgid_id</u>.  The application shall ensure  that  the  file  associated  with
       <u>fildes</u>  is  the  controlling  terminal  of  the calling process and the controlling terminal is currently
       associated with the session of the calling process. The  application  shall  ensure  that  the  value  of
       <u>pgid_id</u> matches a process group ID of a process in the same session as the calling process.

       Attempts  to  use  <u>tcsetpgrp</u>() from a process which is a member of a background process group on a <u>fildes</u>
       associated with its controlling terminal shall cause the process group to be sent a  SIGTTOU  signal.  If
       the  calling  thread  is blocking SIGTTOU signals or the process is ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process
       shall be allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is sent.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise,  -1  shall  be  returned  and  <u>errno</u>  set  to
       indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>tcsetpgrp</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>fildes</u> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>EINVAL</b> This implementation does not support the value in the <u>pgid_id</u> argument.

       <b>EIO</b>    The  process group of the writing process is orphaned, the calling thread is not blocking SIGTTOU,
              and the process is not ignoring SIGTTOU.

       <b>ENOTTY</b> The calling process does not have a controlling terminal, or  the  file  is  not  the  controlling
              terminal,  or  the  controlling  terminal  is no longer associated with the session of the calling
              process.

       <b>EPERM</b>  The value of <u>pgid_id</u> is a value supported by the implementation, but does not  match  the  process
              group ID of a process in the same session as the calling process.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
