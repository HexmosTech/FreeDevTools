</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>MPI_Dist_graph_create_adjacent</u> creates a new communicator <u>comm_dist_graph</u> with distributed graph topology
       and  returns a handle to the new communicator. The number of processes in <u>comm_dist_graph</u> is identical to
       the number of processes in <u>comm_old</u>. Each process passes all information about its incoming and  outgoing
       edges  in the virtual distributed graph topology. The calling processes must ensure that each edge of the
       graph is described in the source and in the destination process with  the  same  weights.  If  there  are
       multiple  edges  for a given (source,dest) pair, then the sequence of the weights of these edges does not
       matter. The complete communication topology is the combination of all edges shown in the  <u>sources</u>  arrays
       of  all  processes  in  comm_old,  which  must  be identical to the combination of all edges shown in the
       <u>destinations</u> arrays. Source and destination ranks must be process ranks of comm_old. This allows a  fully
       distributed  specification  of  the  communication  graph.  Isolated  processes  (i.e., processes with no
       outgoing or incoming edges, that is, processes that have specified indegree and  outdegree  as  zero  and
       thus  do  not  occur  as  source or destination rank in the graph specification) are allowed. The call to
       <u>MPI_Dist_graph_create_adjacent</u> is collective.

</pre><h4><b>WEIGHTS</b></h4><pre>
       Weights are specified as non-negative integers and  can  be  used  to  influence  the  process  remapping
       strategy  and  other  internal  MPI  optimizations.  For  instance,  approximate count arguments of later
       communication calls along specific edges could be used as their edge weights. Multiplicity of  edges  can
       likewise  indicate  more  intense communication between pairs of processes. However, the exact meaning of
       edge weights is not specified by the MPI standard and is left to the implementation. An  application  can
       supply  the  special  value  MPI_UNWEIGHTED for the weight array to indicate that all edges have the same
       (effectively no) weight. It is erroneous to supply MPI_UNWEIGHTED for  some  but  not  all  processes  of
       comm_old.  If  the  graph  is  weighted  but <u>indegree</u> or <u>outdegree</u> is zero, then MPI_WEIGHTS_EMPTY or any
       arbitrary array may be passed to sourceweights or destweights respectively. Note that MPI_UNWEIGHTED  and
       MPI_WEIGHTS_EMPTY  are  not  special  weight  values;  rather they are special values for the total array
       argument. In Fortran, MPI_UNWEIGHTED and MPI_WEIGHTS_EMPTY are objects like MPI_BOTTOM  (not  usable  for
       initialization or assignment).  See MPI-3 section 2.5.4.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Almost  all  MPI  routines  return  an  error  value; C routines as the return result of the function and
       Fortran routines in the last argument.

       Before the error value is returned, the current MPI  error  handler  associated  with  the  communication
       object  (e.g.,  communicator, window, file) is called.  If no communication object is associated with the
       MPI call, then the call is considered attached to MPI_COMM_SELF and will call the  associated  MPI  error
       handler.   When   MPI_COMM_SELF   is   not  initialized  (i.e.,  before  <u>MPI_Init</u>/<u>MPI_Init_thread</u>,  after
       <u>MPI_Finalize</u>, or when using the Sessions Model exclusively) the error raises the initial  error  handler.
       The  initial  error handler can be changed by calling <u>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</u> on MPI_COMM_SELF when using
       the World model, or the mpi_initial_errhandler CLI argument to mpiexec or info  key  to  <u>MPI_Comm_spawn</u>/‐
       <u>MPI_Comm_spawn_multiple</u>.   If no other appropriate error handler has been set, then the MPI_ERRORS_RETURN
       error handler is called for MPI I/O functions and the MPI_ERRORS_ABORT error handler is  called  for  all
       other MPI functions.

       Open MPI includes three predefined error handlers that can be used:

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL</b> Causes the program to abort all connected MPI processes.

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_ABORT</b> An error handler that can be invoked on a communicator, window, file, or session. When
         called  on  a  communicator,  it  acts  as if <u>MPI_Abort</u> was called on that communicator. If called on a
         window or file, acts as if <u>MPI_Abort</u> was called on a communicator containing the group of processes  in
         the corresponding window or file. If called on a session, aborts only the local process.

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_RETURN</b> Returns an error code to the application.

       MPI applications can also implement their own error handlers by calling:

       • <u>MPI_Comm_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</u>

       • <u>MPI_File_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_File_set_errhandler</u>

       • <u>MPI_Session_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Session_set_errhandler</u> or at <u>MPI_Session_init</u>

       • <u>MPI_Win_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Win_set_errhandler</u>

       Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.

       See the <u>MPI</u> <u>man</u> <u>page</u> for a full list of <u>MPI</u> <u>error</u> <u>codes</u>.

       See the Error Handling section of the MPI-3.1 standard for more information.
