</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>

       This  set  of functions provides a POSIX-style API for the PCRE regular expression 8-bit library. See the
       <b>pcreapi</b>  documentation  for  a  description  of  PCRE's  native  API,  which  contains  much   additional
       functionality. There is no POSIX-style wrapper for PCRE's 16-bit and 32-bit library.

       The  functions  described here are just wrapper functions that ultimately call the PCRE native API. Their
       prototypes are defined in the <b>pcreposix.h</b> header file, and on Unix systems the library itself  is  called
       <b>pcreposix.a</b>, so can be accessed by adding <b>-lpcreposix</b> to the command for linking an application that uses
       them. Because the POSIX functions call the native ones, it is also necessary to add <b>-lpcre</b>.

       I  have implemented only those POSIX option bits that can be reasonably mapped to PCRE native options. In
       addition, the option REG_EXTENDED is defined with the value zero. This has no effect, but since  programs
       that  are  written  to  the  POSIX  interface  often  use  it,  this makes it easier to slot in PCRE as a
       replacement library. Other POSIX options are not even defined.

       There are also some other options that are not defined by POSIX. These have been added at the request  of
       users who want to make use of certain PCRE-specific features via the POSIX calling interface.

       When  PCRE  is called via these functions, it is only the API that is POSIX-like in style. The syntax and
       semantics of the regular expressions themselves are still those  of  Perl,  subject  to  the  setting  of
       various  PCRE  options,  as described below. "POSIX-like in style" means that the API approximates to the
       POSIX definition; it is not fully POSIX-compatible, and in multi-byte encoding  domains  it  is  probably
       even less compatible.

       The  header  for these functions is supplied as <b>pcreposix.h</b> to avoid any potential clash with other POSIX
       libraries. It can, of course, be renamed or aliased as <b>regex.h</b>, which is the "correct" name. It  provides
       two  structure  types,  <u>regex_t</u>  for  compiled  internal  forms,  and  <u>regmatch_t</u>  for returning captured
       substrings. It also defines some constants whose names start with "REG_";  these  are  used  for  setting
       options and identifying error codes.

</pre><h4><b>COMPILING</b> <b>A</b> <b>PATTERN</b></h4><pre>

       The  function  <b>regcomp()</b>  is called to compile a pattern into an internal form. The pattern is a C string
       terminated by a binary zero, and is passed in the argument <u>pattern</u>. The <u>preg</u> argument is a pointer  to  a
       <b>regex_t</b> structure that is used as a base for storing information about the compiled regular expression.

       The argument <u>cflags</u> is either zero, or contains one or more of the bits defined by the following macros:

         REG_DOTALL

       The  PCRE_DOTALL  option  is  set  when  the  regular  expression is passed for compilation to the native
       function. Note that REG_DOTALL is not part of the POSIX standard.

         REG_ICASE

       The PCRE_CASELESS option is set when the regular expression is  passed  for  compilation  to  the  native
       function.

         REG_NEWLINE

       The  PCRE_MULTILINE  option  is  set  when the regular expression is passed for compilation to the native
       function. Note that this does <u>not</u> mimic the defined POSIX behaviour for REG_NEWLINE  (see  the  following
       section).

         REG_NOSUB

       The  PCRE_NO_AUTO_CAPTURE  option  is  set  when  the regular expression is passed for compilation to the
       native function. In addition, when a pattern that is compiled with this flag is passed to  <b>regexec()</b>  for
       matching, the <u>nmatch</u> and <u>pmatch</u> arguments are ignored, and no captured strings are returned.

         REG_UCP

       The  PCRE_UCP option is set when the regular expression is passed for compilation to the native function.
       This causes PCRE to use Unicode properties when matchine \d, \w, etc., instead of just recognizing  ASCII
       values. Note that REG_UTF8 is not part of the POSIX standard.

         REG_UNGREEDY

       The  PCRE_UNGREEDY  option  is  set  when  the regular expression is passed for compilation to the native
       function. Note that REG_UNGREEDY is not part of the POSIX standard.

         REG_UTF8

       The PCRE_UTF8 option is set when the regular expression is passed for compilation to the native function.
       This causes the pattern itself and all data strings used for matching it to be treated as UTF-8  strings.
       Note that REG_UTF8 is not part of the POSIX standard.

       In the absence of these flags, no options are passed to the native function.  This means the the regex is
       compiled with PCRE default semantics. In particular, the way it handles newline characters in the subject
       string  is the Perl way, not the POSIX way. Note that setting PCRE_MULTILINE has only <u>some</u> of the effects
       specified for REG_NEWLINE. It does not affect the way newlines are matched by . (they are not)  or  by  a
       negative class such as [^a] (they are).

       The  yield  of  <b>regcomp()</b>  is zero on success, and non-zero otherwise. The <u>preg</u> structure is filled in on
       success, and one member of the structure is public: <u>re_nsub</u> contains the number of capturing  subpatterns
       in the regular expression. Various error codes are defined in the header file.

       NOTE:  If  the  yield  of  <b>regcomp()</b>  is  non-zero,  you must not attempt to use the contents of the <u>preg</u>
       structure. If, for example, you pass it to <b>regexec()</b>, the result is undefined and your program is  likely
       to crash.

</pre><h4><b>MATCHING</b> <b>NEWLINE</b> <b>CHARACTERS</b></h4><pre>

       This  area  is  not simple, because POSIX and Perl take different views of things.  It is not possible to
       get PCRE to obey POSIX semantics, but then PCRE was never intended to be a POSIX  engine.  The  following
       table lists the different possibilities for matching newline characters in PCRE:

                                 Default   Change with

         . matches newline          no     PCRE_DOTALL
         newline matches [^a]       yes    not changeable
         $ matches \n at end        yes    PCRE_DOLLARENDONLY
         $ matches \n in middle     no     PCRE_MULTILINE
         ^ matches \n in middle     no     PCRE_MULTILINE

       This is the equivalent table for POSIX:

                                 Default   Change with

         . matches newline          yes    REG_NEWLINE
         newline matches [^a]       yes    REG_NEWLINE
         $ matches \n at end        no     REG_NEWLINE
         $ matches \n in middle     no     REG_NEWLINE
         ^ matches \n in middle     no     REG_NEWLINE

       PCRE's  behaviour  is  the  same as Perl's, except that there is no equivalent for PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY in
       Perl. In both PCRE and Perl, there is no way to stop newline from matching [^a].

       The default POSIX newline handling can be obtained by setting PCRE_DOTALL  and  PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY,  but
       there is no way to make PCRE behave exactly as for the REG_NEWLINE action.

</pre><h4><b>MATCHING</b> <b>A</b> <b>PATTERN</b></h4><pre>

       The  function  <b>regexec()</b>  is  called to match a compiled pattern <u>preg</u> against a given <u>string</u>, which is by
       default terminated by a zero byte (but see REG_STARTEND below), subject to the options in  <u>eflags</u>.  These
       can be:

         REG_NOTBOL

       The PCRE_NOTBOL option is set when calling the underlying PCRE matching function.

         REG_NOTEMPTY

       The  PCRE_NOTEMPTY  option  is  set  when  calling  the  underlying  PCRE  matching  function.  Note that
       REG_NOTEMPTY is not part of the POSIX standard. However, setting this option  can  give  more  POSIX-like
       behaviour in some situations.

         REG_NOTEOL

       The PCRE_NOTEOL option is set when calling the underlying PCRE matching function.

         REG_STARTEND

       The  string  is  considered to start at <u>string</u> + <u>pmatch[0].rm_so</u> and to have a terminating NUL located at
       <u>string</u> + <u>pmatch[0].rm_eo</u> (there need not actually be a NUL at that location), regardless of the value  of
       <u>nmatch</u>. This is a BSD extension, compatible with but not specified by IEEE Standard 1003.2 (POSIX.2), and
       should  be  used  with caution in software intended to be portable to other systems. Note that a non-zero
       <u>rm_so</u> does not imply REG_NOTBOL; REG_STARTEND affects only the location of the  string,  not  how  it  is
       matched.

       If  the  pattern was compiled with the REG_NOSUB flag, no data about any matched strings is returned. The
       <u>nmatch</u> and <u>pmatch</u> arguments of <b>regexec()</b> are ignored.

       If the value of <u>nmatch</u> is zero, or if the value <u>pmatch</u> is NULL, no data  about  any  matched  strings  is
       returned.

       Otherwise,the  portion of the string that was matched, and also any captured substrings, are returned via
       the <u>pmatch</u> argument, which points to an array of <u>nmatch</u> structures of  type  <u>regmatch_t</u>,  containing  the
       members <u>rm_so</u> and <u>rm_eo</u>. These contain the offset to the first character of each substring and the offset
       to  the  first  character  after  the  end of each substring, respectively. The 0th element of the vector
       relates to the entire portion of <u>string</u> that was matched; subsequent elements  relate  to  the  capturing
       subpatterns of the regular expression. Unused entries in the array have both structure members set to -1.

       A  successful  match  yields  a zero return; various error codes are defined in the header file, of which
       REG_NOMATCH is the "expected" failure code.

</pre><h4><b>ERROR</b> <b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>

       The <b>regerror()</b> function maps a non-zero errorcode from either  <b>regcomp()</b>  or  <b>regexec()</b>  to  a  printable
       message.  If  <u>preg</u>  is  not  NULL, the error should have arisen from the use of that structure. A message
       terminated by a binary zero is placed in <u>errbuf</u>. The length  of  the  message,  including  the  zero,  is
       limited to <u>errbuf_size</u>. The yield of the function is the size of buffer needed to hold the whole message.

</pre><h4><b>MEMORY</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>

       Compiling  a regular expression causes memory to be allocated and associated with the <u>preg</u> structure. The
       function <b>regfree()</b> frees all such memory,  after  which  <u>preg</u>  may  no  longer  be  used  as  a  compiled
       expression.
