</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PWRITY - draws text and other characters using polylines.

</pre><h4><b>UTILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This routine is part of the Pwrite_family utility in NCAR Graphics. To see the overview man page for this
       utility, type "man pwrite_family".

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       PWRITY is obsolete.  It has been replaced by the PLCHHQ, PLCHMQ, and PLCHLQ entries of the Plotchar
       utility.

       PWRITY continues to be provided for compatibility of early NCAR Graphics codes.  If you are writing new
       code, we suggest that you use Plotchar.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL PWRITY (X,Y,IDPC,NCHAR,JSIZE,JOR,JCTR)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       X           (an  input  parameter  of type REAL) defining the X world coordinate of the text string to be
                   drawn using polylines.

       Y           (an input parameter of type REAL) defining the Y world coordinate of the text  string  to  be
                   drawn using polylines.

       IDPC        (an input string of type CHARACTER) which are the characters to be drawn.

       NCHAR       (an input parameter of type INTEGER) giving the number of characters in the IDPC string.

       JSIZE       (an input parameter of type INTEGER) giving the width of the characters to be drawn.

                   0  -   8./1023. NDCs
                   1  -  12./1023. NDCs
                   2  -  16./1023. NDCs
                   3  -  24./1023. NDCs

                   If greater than 3:

                   FLOAT(JSIZE)/1023. NDCs

                   One  can relate these sizes to a viewport in normalized device coordinates (each axis runs 0.
                   to 1.) by dividing by 1023.  That is a character of  width  .05  would  take  up  5%  of  the
                   possible picture width meaning that less than 20 characters could fit on a line.

                   Note  that  there  is  an  important  difference  in how text sizes are handled in GKS versus
                   PWRITY.  In GKS, text size is given in terms of character  heights.   In  PWRITY,  text  size
                   (JSIZE) is given in character width.

       JOR         (an input parameter of type INTEGER) giving the orientation at which the IDPC string is to be
                   drawn.  JOR is measured counter-clockwise from the positive X axis.

       JCTR        (an  input  parameter  of  type  INTEGER)  giving the centering option for the IDPC character
                   string.

                       0, (X,Y) is the center of the entire IDPC string.
                      -1, (X,Y) is the center of the left edge of the
                                first character.
                       1  (X,Y) is the center of the right edge of the
                                last character.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use PWRITY, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, ncarg_c,  and  ncarg_c,  preferably  in
       that order.
