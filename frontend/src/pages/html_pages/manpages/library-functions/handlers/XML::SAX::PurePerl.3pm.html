       XML::SAX::PurePerl - Pure Perl XML Parser with SAX2 interface

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use XML::Handler::Foo;
         use XML::SAX::PurePerl;
         my $handler = XML::Handler::Foo-&gt;new();
         my $parser = XML::SAX::PurePerl-&gt;new(Handler =&gt; $handler);
         $parser-&gt;parse_uri("myfile.xml");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements an XML parser in pure perl. It is written around the upcoming perl 5.8's unicode
       support and support for multiple document encodings (using the PerlIO layer), however it has been ported
       to work with ASCII/UTF8 documents under lower perl versions.

       The SAX2 API is described in detail at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/perl-xml/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/perl-xml/</a>, in the CVS archive,
       under libxml-perl/docs. Hopefully those documents will be in a better location soon.

       Please refer to the SAX2 documentation for how to use this module - it is merely a front end to SAX2, and
       implements nothing that is not in that spec (or at least tries not to - please email me if you find
       errors in this implementation).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       XML::SAX::PurePerl is <b>slow</b>. Very slow. I suggest you use something else in fact. However it is great as a
       fallback parser for XML::SAX, where the user might not be able to install an XS based parser or C
       library.

       Currently lots, probably. At the moment the weakest area is parsing DOCTYPE declarations, though the code
       is in place to start doing this. Also parsing parameter entity references is causing me much confusion,
       since it's not exactly what I would call trivial, or well documented in the XML grammar. XML documents
       with internal subsets are likely to fail.

       I am however trying to work towards full conformance using the Oasis test suite.
