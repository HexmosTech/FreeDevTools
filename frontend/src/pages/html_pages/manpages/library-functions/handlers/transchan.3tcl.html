</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Tcl-level  handler  for  a  channel  transformation  has to be a command with subcommands (termed an
       <u>ensemble</u> despite not implying that it must be created with <b>namespace</b> <b>ensemble</b> <b>create</b>; this  mechanism  is
       not  tied to <b>namespace</b> <b>ensemble</b> in any way). Note that <u>cmdPrefix</u> is whatever was specified in the call to
       <b>chan</b> <b>push</b>, and may consist of multiple arguments; this will be expanded to multiple words in place of the
       prefix.

       Of all the possible subcommands, the handler <u>must</u> support <b>initialize</b> and  <b>finalize</b>.  Transformations  for
       writable  channels  must  also support <b>write</b>, and transformations for readable channels must also support
       <b>read</b>.

       Note that in the descriptions below <u>cmdPrefix</u> may be more than one word, and <u>handle</u> is the value returned
       by the <b>chan</b> <b>push</b> call used to create the transformation.

   <b>GENERIC</b> <b>SUBCOMMANDS</b>
       The following subcommands are relevant to all types of channel.

       <u>cmdPrefix</u> <b>clear</b> <u>handle</u>
              This optional subcommand is called to signify to  the  transformation  that  any  data  stored  in
              internal  buffers  (either incoming or outgoing) must be cleared. It is called when a <b>chan</b> <b>seek</b> is
              performed on the channel being transformed.

       <u>cmdPrefix</u> <b>finalize</b> <u>handle</u>
              This mandatory subcommand is called last for the given <u>handle</u>, and then never again, and it exists
              to allow for cleaning up  any  Tcl-level  data  structures  associated  with  the  transformation.
              <u>Warning!</u>  Any  errors thrown by this subcommand will be ignored. It is not guaranteed to be called
              if the interpreter is deleted.

       <u>cmdPrefix</u> <b>initialize</b> <u>handle</u> <u>mode</u>
              This mandatory subcommand is called first, and then  never  again  (for  the  given  <u>handle</u>).  Its
              responsibility  is  to  initialize all parts of the transformation at the Tcl level. The <u>mode</u> is a
              list containing any of <b>read</b> and <b>write</b>.

              <b>write</b>  implies that the channel is writable.

              <b>read</b>   implies that the channel is readable.

              The return value of the subcommand should be a  list  containing  the  names  of  all  subcommands
              supported  by  this  handler.  Any error thrown by the subcommand will prevent the creation of the
              transformation. The thrown error will appear as error thrown by <b>chan</b> <b>push</b>.

   <b>READ-RELATED</b> <b>SUBCOMMANDS</b>
       These subcommands are used for handling transformations applied to  readable  channels;  though  strictly
       <b>read</b> is optional, it must be supported if any of the others is or the channel will be made non-readable.

       <u>cmdPrefix</u> <b>drain</b> <u>handle</u>
              This  optional  subcommand  is called whenever data in the transformation input (i.e. read) buffer
              has to be forced upward, i.e. towards the user or script.  The result returned by  the  method  is
              taken  as  the  <u>binary</u> data to push upward to the level above this transformation (the reader or a
              higher-level transformation).

              In  other  words,  when  this  method  is  called  the  transformation  cannot  defer  the  actual
              transformation  operation  anymore  and  has  to  transform  all data waiting in its internal read
              buffers and return the result of that action.

       <u>cmdPrefix</u> <b>limit?</b> <u>handle</u>
              This optional subcommand is called to allow the Tcl I/O engine  to  determine  how  far  ahead  it
              should  read. If present, it should return an integer number greater than zero which indicates how
              many bytes ahead should be read, or an integer less than zero to indicate that the I/O engine  may
              read as far ahead as it likes.

       <u>cmdPrefix</u> <b>read</b> <u>handle</u> <u>buffer</u>
              This subcommand, which must be present if the transformation is to work with readable channels, is
              called  whenever  the  base  channel,  or  a transformation below this transformation, pushes data
              upward. The <u>buffer</u> contains the binary data which has been given to  us  from  below.  It  is  the
              responsibility  of  this  subcommand  to  actually  transform the data. The result returned by the
              subcommand is taken as the binary data to push further upward to  the  transformation  above  this
              transformation. This can also be the user or script that originally read from the channel.

              Note  that  the  result  is  allowed  to  be  empty,  or  even less than the data we received; the
              transformation is not required to transform everything given to it right now.  It  is  allowed  to
              store  incoming  data in internal buffers and to defer the actual transformation until it has more
              data.

   <b>WRITE-RELATED</b> <b>SUBCOMMANDS</b>
       These subcommands are used for handling transformations applied to  writable  channels;  though  strictly
       <b>write</b> is optional, it must be supported if any of the others is or the channel will be made non-writable.

       <u>cmdPrefix</u> <b>flush</b> <u>handle</u>
              This  optional  subcommand  is called whenever data in the transformation 'write' buffer has to be
              forced downward, i.e. towards the base channel. The result returned by the subcommand is taken  as
              the  binary  data to write to the transformation below the current transformation. This can be the
              base channel as well.

              In other words, when this  subcommand  is  called  the  transformation  cannot  defer  the  actual
              transformation  operation  anymore  and  has  to  transform all data waiting in its internal write
              buffers and return the result of that action.

       <u>cmdPrefix</u> <b>write</b> <u>handle</u> <u>buffer</u>
              This subcommand, which must be present if the transformation is to work with writable channels, is
              called whenever the user, or a transformation above this transformation, writes data downward. The
              <u>buffer</u> contains the binary data which has been written to us. It is  the  responsibility  of  this
              subcommand to actually transform the data.

              The  result  returned by the subcommand is taken as the binary data to write to the transformation
              below this transformation. This can be the base channel as well. Note that the result  is  allowed
              to  be  empty,  or  less  than  the  data  we got; the transformation is not required to transform
              everything which was written to it right now. It is allowed to store this data in internal buffers
              and to defer the actual transformation until it has more data.
