       XML::Handler::YAWriter - Yet another Perl SAX XML Writer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use XML::Handler::YAWriter;

         my $ya = new XML::Handler::YAWriter( %options );
         my $perlsax = new XML::Parser::PerlSAX( 'Handler' =&gt; $ya );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       YAWriter implements Yet Another XML::Handler::Writer. The reasons for this one are that I needed a
       flexible escaping technique, and want some kind of pretty printing. If an instance of YAWriter is created
       without any options, the default behavior is to produce an array of strings containing the XML in :

         @{$ya-&gt;{Strings}}

   <b>Options</b>
       Options are given in the usual 'key' =&gt; 'value' idiom.

       Output IO::File
           This option tells YAWriter to use an already open file for output, instead of using $ya-&gt;{Strings} to
           store  the  array of strings. It should be noted that the only thing the object needs to implement is
           the print method. So anything can be used to receive a stream of strings from YAWriter.

       AsFile string
           This option will cause start_document to open named file  and  end_document  to  close  it.  Use  the
           literal dash "-" if you want to print on standard output.

       AsPipe string
           This  option  will  cause  start_document  to open a pipe and end_document to close it. The pipe is a
           normal shell command. Secure shell comes handy but has a 2GB limit on most systems.

       AsArray boolean
           This option will force storage of the XML in $ya-&gt;{Strings}, even if the Output option is given.

       AsString boolean
           This option will cause end_document to return the complete XML document in a single string. Most  SAX
           drivers return the value of end_document as a result of their parse method. As this may not work with
           some  combinations  of SAX drivers and filters, a join of $ya-&gt;{Strings} in the controlling method is
           preferred.

       Encoding string
           This will change the default encoding from UTF-8 to anything you like.  You should ensure that  given
           data are already in this encoding or provide an Escape hash, to tell YAWriter about the recoding.

       Escape hash
           The  Escape  hash defines substitutions that have to be done to any string, with the exception of the
           processing_instruction and doctype_decl methods, where I think that escaping of target and data would
           cause more trouble than necessary.

           The default value for Escape is

               $XML::Handler::YAWriter::escape = {
                       '&amp;'  =&gt; '&amp;amp;',
                       '&lt;'  =&gt; '&amp;lt;',
                       '&gt;'  =&gt; '&amp;gt;',
                       '"'  =&gt; '&amp;quot;',
                       '--' =&gt; '&amp;#45;&amp;#45;'
                       };

           YAWriter will use an evaluated sub to make the recoding based on a given Escape hash reasonably fast.
           Future versions may use XS to improve this performance bottleneck.

       Pretty hash
           Hash of string =&gt; boolean tuples, to define kind of prettyprinting. Default to undef. Possible string
           values:

           AddHiddenNewline boolean
               Add hidden newline before "&gt;"

           AddHiddenAttrTab boolean
               Add hidden tabulation for attributes

           CatchEmptyElement boolean
               Catch empty Elements, apply "/&gt;" compression

           CatchWhiteSpace boolean
               Catch whitespace with comments

           CompactAttrIndent
               Places Attributes on the same line as the Element

           IsSGML boolean
               This option will cause start_document, processing_instruction and doctype_decl to appear as SGML.
               The SGML is still well-formed of course, if your SAX events are well-formed.

           NoComments boolean
               Supress Comments

           NoDTD boolean
               Supress DTD

           NoPI boolean
               Supress Processing Instructions

           NoProlog boolean
               Supress &lt;?xml ... ?&gt; Prolog

           NoWhiteSpace boolean
               Supress WhiteSpace to clean documents from prior pretty printing.

           PrettyWhiteIndent boolean
               Add visible indent before any eventstring

           PrettyWhiteNewline boolean
               Add visible newlines before any eventstring

           SAX1 boolean (not yet implemented)
               Output only SAX1 compliant eventstrings

   <b>Notes:</b>
       Correct handling of start_document and end_document is required!

       The YAWriter Object initialises  its  structures  during  start_document  and  does  its  cleanup  during
       end_document.   If  you  forget  to call start_document, any other method will break during the run. Most
       likely place is the encode method, trying  to  eval  undef  as  a  subroutine.  If  you  forget  to  call
       end_document, you should not use a single instance of YAWriter more than once.

       For  small documents AsArray may be the fastest method and AsString the easiest one to receive the output
       of YAWriter. But AsString and AsArray may run out of memory with infinite SAX streams.  The  only  method
       XML::Handler::Writer  calls  on  a  given  Output  object is the print method. So it's easy to use a self
       written Output object to improve streaming.

       A single instance of XML::Handler::YAWriter is able to produce more than one file in  a  single  run.  Be
       sure  to  provide  a  fresh  IO::File  as Output before you call start_document and close this File after
       calling end_document. Or provide a filename in AsFile, so start_document and end_document  can  open  and
       close its own filehandle.

       Automatic recoding between 8bit and 16bit does not work in any Perl correctly !

       I have Perl-5.00563 at home and here I can specify "use utf8;" in the right places to make recoding work.
       But I dislike saying "use 5.00555;" because many systems run 5.00503.

       If  you  use  some  8bit  character  set  internally  and want use national characters, either state your
       character as Encoding to be ISO-8859-1, or provide an Escape hash similar to the following :

           $ya-&gt;{'Escape'} = {
                           '&amp;'  =&gt; '&amp;amp;',
                           '&lt;'  =&gt; '&amp;lt;',
                           '&gt;'  =&gt; '&amp;gt;',
                           '"'  =&gt; '&amp;quot;',
                           '--' =&gt; '&amp;#45;&amp;#45;'
                           'ö' =&gt; '&amp;ouml;'
                           'ä' =&gt; '&amp;auml;'
                           'ü' =&gt; '&amp;uuml;'
                           'Ö' =&gt; '&amp;Ouml;'
                           'Ä' =&gt; '&amp;Auml;'
                           'Ü' =&gt; '&amp;Uuml;'
                           'ß' =&gt; '&amp;szlig;'
                           };

       You may abuse YAWriter to clean whitespace from XML documents. Take a look at test.pl,  doing  just  that
       with  an XML::Edifact message, without querying the DTD. This may work in 99% of the cases where you want
       to get rid of ignorable whitespace caused by the various forms of pretty printing.

           my $ya = new XML::Handler::YAWriter(
               'Output' =&gt; new IO::File ( "&gt;-" );
               'Pretty' =&gt; {
                   'NoWhiteSpace'=&gt;1,
                   'NoComments'=&gt;1,
                   'AddHiddenNewline'=&gt;1,
                   'AddHiddenAttrTab'=&gt;1,
               } );

       XML::Handler::Writer implements any method XML::Parser::PerlSAX wants.   This  extends  the  Java  SAX1.0
       specification.  I  have  in mind using Pretty=&gt;SAX1=&gt;1 to disable this feature, if abusing YAWriter for a
       SAX proxy.
