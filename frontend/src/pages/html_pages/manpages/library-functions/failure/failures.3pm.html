           use Safe::Isa; # for $_isa

                   ...
               }
               else {
                   ...
               }
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module lets you define an exception hierarchy quickly and simply.

       Here were my design goals:

       •   minimalist interface

       •   80% of features in 20% of lines of code

       •   depend only on core modules (nearly achieved)

       •   support hierarchical error types

       •   identify errors types by name (class) not by parsing strings

       •   leave (possibly expensive) trace decisions to the thrower

       Currently, "failures" is implemented in under 70 lines of code.

       Failure  objects  are  implemented with Class::Tiny to allow easy subclassing (see custom::failures), but
       "Class::Tiny" only requires core modules, so other than that exception, the 'core only' goal is achieved.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Defining</b> <b>failure</b> <b>categories</b>
           use failures qw/foo::bar foo::baz/;

       This will define the following classes in the "failure" namespace:

       •   "failure"

       •   "failure::foo"

       •   "failure::foo::bar"

       •   "failure::foo::baz"

       Subclasses inherit, so "failure::foo::bar" is-a "failure::foo" and "failure::foo" is-a "failure".

   <b>Attributes</b>
       A failure class has three attributes: "msg", "payload", and "trace".  Their  usage  is  described  below.
       Accessors exist for all three.

   <b>Throwing</b> <b>failures</b>
       The "throw" method of a failure class takes a single, optional argument that modifies how failure objects
       are stringified.

       If no argument is given, a default message is generated if the object is stringified:

           say failure::foo::bar-&gt;throw;
           # Caught failure::foo::bar

       With  a single, non-hash-reference argument, the argument is used for the "msg" attribute and is appended
       if the object is stringified.

           say failure::foo::bar-&gt;throw("Ouch!");
           # Caught failure::foo::bar: Ouch!

       With a hash reference argument, the "msg" key provides the string to append to the default error.  If you
       have extra data to attach to the exception, use the "payload" key:

           failure::foo::bar-&gt;throw({
               msg     =&gt; "Ouch!",
               payload =&gt; $extra_data,
           });

       If an optional "trace" key is provided, it is appended if the object is stringified.  To loosely  emulate
       "die" and provide a simple filename and line number, use the "failure-&gt;line_trace" class method:

           failure::foo::bar-&gt;throw({
               msg =&gt; "Ouch!",
               trace =&gt; failure-&gt;line_trace,
           });

           # Caught failure::foo::bar: Ouch!
           #
           # Failure caught at &lt;FILENAME&gt; line &lt;NUMBER&gt;

       To  provide  a  trace just like the Carp module (including respecting @CARP_NOT) use the "croak_trace" or
       "confess_trace" class methods:

           failure::foo::bar-&gt;throw({
               msg =&gt; "Ouch!",
               trace =&gt; failure-&gt;croak_trace,
           });

           # Caught failure::foo::bar: Ouch!
           #
           # Failure caught at &lt;CALLING-FILENAME&gt; line &lt;NUMBER&gt;

           failure::foo::bar-&gt;throw({
               msg =&gt; "Ouch!",
               trace =&gt; failure-&gt;confess_trace,
           });

           # Caught failure::foo::bar: Ouch!
           #
           # Failure caught at &lt;FILENAME&gt; line &lt;NUMBER&gt;
           #   [confess stack trace continues]

       You can provide a "trace" key with any object that overrides stringification, like Devel::StackTrace:

           failure::foo::bar-&gt;throw({
               msg =&gt; "Ouch!",
               trace =&gt; Devel::StackTrace-&gt;new,
           });

           # Caught failure::foo::bar: Ouch!
           #
           # [stringified Devel::StackTrace object]

   <b>Catching</b> <b>failures</b>
       Use Try::Tiny, of course.  Within a catch block, you know that $_ is defined, but it still  might  be  an
       unblessed  reference  or something that is risky to call "isa" on.  If you load Safe::Isa, you get a code
       reference in $_isa that calls "isa" only on objects.

       So catching looks like this:

           use Try::Tiny;
           use Safe::Isa;

           try { ... }
           catch {
               if ( $_-&gt;$_isa("failure::foo") ) {
                   # handle it
               }
           };

       If you need to rethrow the exception, just use "die":

           elsif ( $_-&gt;$_isa("failure") ) {
               die $_;
           }

   <b>Overriding</b> <b>failure</b> <b>class</b> <b>behavior</b>
       See custom::failures.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       There are many error/exception systems on CPAN.  This one is designed to be minimalist.

       If you have more complex or substantial needs, people I know and trust seem to be recommending:

       •   Throwable — exceptions as a Moo/Moose role

       •   Throwable::X — Throwable extended with extra goodies

       Here are other modules I found that weren't appropriate for my needs or didn't suit my taste:

       •   Class::Throwable — no hierarchy and always builds a full stack trace

       •   Error::Tiny — blends Try::Tiny and a trivial exception base class

       •   Exception::Base — complexity on par with Exception::Class, but highly optimized for speed

       •   Exception::Class — once highly recommended, but even the author now suggests Throwable

       •   Exception::Simple — very simple, but always uses "caller" and has no hierarchy

       •   Exception::Tiny — not bad, but always uses "caller" and setting up a hierarchy requires extra work

       •   Ouch — simple, well-thought out, but no hierarchy; also cutesy function names

       Here are some that I'm very dubious about:

       •   Err — alpha since 2012

       •   Error — no longer recommended by maintainer

       •   errors — "still under design" since 2009

       •   Exception — dates back to 1996 and undocumented
