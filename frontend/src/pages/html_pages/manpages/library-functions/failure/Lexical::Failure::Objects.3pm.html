</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Lexical::Failure::Objects - Special failure objects for Lexical::Failure

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Lexical::Failure::Objects version 0.000001

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements the "failure objects" returned by the optional 'failobj' mechanism of the
       "Lexical::Failure" module.

       When "ON_FAILURE 'failobj'" is in effect, any call to "fail" will return one of these objects, which
       simulates a special out-of-band value that you can either explicitly test for failure or else simply
       ignore and automatically get an exception.

       For example, given the subroutine:

           package Math;
           use Lexical::Failure;

           sub inverse_square {
               my ($n) = @_;

               if ($n == 0) {
                   fail "Can't invert zero";
               }

               return 1/$n**2;
           }

       when 'failobj' is the selected failure signalling strategy:

           use Math (fail =&gt; 'failobj')

       then failure can either be tested for explicitly:

           # This block skipped if $n == 0...
           if (my $inv_sq = Math::inverse_square($n) {
               print $inv_sq;
           }

       or else simply ignored, in which case an exception will automatically be thrown:

           print inverse_square($n);    # ...throw exception if $n == 0

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       If it is used as a boolean, a failure object evaluates false (i.e. it acts as if "ON_FAILURE 'undef'" had
       been in effect).

       If it is used as a value in <u>any</u> other way (as a string, as a reference, as a regex, as a filehandle,
       etc., etc.), or if it's ignored and allowed to go out of scope without being evaluated at all, then a
       failure object throws an exception (i.e. it acts as if "ON_FAILURE 'croak'" had been in effect).

   <b>Constructor</b> <b>("new()")</b>
       The class's constructor expects two named arguments:

           $failure_obj = Lexical::Failure::Objects-&gt;new(
                              msg     =&gt; $MESSAGE_STR_OR_OBJ,
                              context =&gt; [$PACKAGE, $FILE, $LINE, $SUBNAME],
                          );

       You should never normally need to construct failure objects directly; it's better to let
       "Lexical::Failure" craete them automatically via its 'failobj' mechanism.

   <b>Methods</b>
       "Lexical::Failure::Objects" also provides four methods with which you can query the location of the
       failure that they represent. None of these methods takes any arguments.

       "$failobj-&gt;subname()"
           Returns  the  name  of  the subroutine in which the failure was signaled.  That is, the equivalent of
           "(caller 0)[3]".

       "$failobj-&gt;file()"
           Returns the name of the file containing the subroutine call from which failure  was  signaled.   That
           is, the equivalent of "(caller 0)[1]".

       "$failobj-&gt;line()"
           Returns  the  line  number  of  the  subroutine  call  from which failure was signaled.  That is, the
           equivalent of "(caller 0)[2]".

       "$failobj-&gt;context()"
           Returns a string summarizing the information provided by the previous three methods, in the form:

               "call to &lt;subname&gt; at &lt;file&gt; line &lt;line&gt;"

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       None of their own.

       If they throw an exception (when misused or  ignored),  it  will  be  the  exception  that  "fail"  would
       otherwise have thrown.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
