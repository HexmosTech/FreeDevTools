</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>tdbc::odbc</b> driver provides a database interface that conforms to Tcl DataBase Connectivity (TDBC) and
       allows  a Tcl script to connect to any SQL database presenting an ODBC interface.  It is also provided as
       a worked example of how to write a database driver in C, so that driver authors have a starting point for
       further development.

       Connection to an ODBC database is established by invoking <b>tdbc::odbc::connection</b> <b>create</b>, passing  it  the
       name to be used as a connection handle, followed by a standard ODBC connection string. As an alternative,
       <b>tdbc::odbc::connection</b>  <b>new</b>  may  be  used to create a database connection with an automatically assigned
       name. The return value from <b>tdbc::odbc::connection</b> <b>new</b> is the name that was  chosen  for  the  connection
       handle.

       The  connection  string  will  include  at least a <b>DRIVER</b> or <b>DSN</b> keyword, and may include others that are
       defined by a particular ODBC driver. (If the local ODBC system supports a graphical user  interface,  the
       <b>-parent</b>  option  (see  below)  may  allow  calling <b>tdbc::odbc::connection</b> <b>create</b> with an empty connection
       string.)

       The side  effect  of  <b>tdbc::odbc::connection</b>  <b>create</b>  is  to  create  a  new  database  connection..  See
       <b>tdbc::<a href="../man3tcl/connection.3tcl.html">connection</a>(3tcl)</b> for the details of how to use the connection to manipulate a database.

       In  addition  to  a standard TDBC interface, <b>tdbc::odbc</b> supports three additional ccommands. The first of
       these, <b>tdbc::odbc::datasources</b>, which returns a Tcl list enumerating the named data sources available  to
       the   program  (for  connection  with  the  <b>DSN</b>  keyword  in  the  connection  string).   The  result  of
       <b>tdbc::odbc::datasources</b> may be constrained to only system data sources  or  only  user  data  sources  by
       including the <b>-system</b> or <b>-user</b> options, respectively.

       The  <b>tdbc::odbc::drivers</b>  command  returns a dictionary whose keys are the names of drivers available for
       the <b>DRIVER</b> keyword in the connection string, and whose values are descriptions of the drivers.

       The <b>tdbc::odbc::datasource</b> command allows configuration of named  data  sources  on  those  systems  that
       support  the  ODBC Installer application programming interface. It accepts a <u>command</u>, which specifies the
       operation to be performed, the name of a <u>driver</u> for the database in question, and a set of  keyword-value
       pairs that are interpreted by the given driver. The <u>command</u> must be one of the following:

       <b>add</b>    Adds  a  user  data  source. The keyword-value pairs must include at least a <b>DSN</b> option naming the
              data source

       <b>add_system</b>
              Adds a system data source. The keyword-value pairs must include at least a <b>DSN</b> option  naming  the
              data source

       <b>configure</b>
              Configures  a  user  data source. The keyword-value pairs will usually include a <b>DSN</b> option naming
              the data source. Some drivers will support other options, such as  the  <b>CREATE_DB</b>  option  to  the
              Microsoft Access driver on Windows.

       <b>configure_system</b>
              Configures a system data source.

       <b>remove</b> Removes  a user data source. The keyword-value pairs must include a <b>DSN</b> option specifying the data
              source to remove.

       <b>remove_system</b>
              Removes a system data source. The keyword-value pairs must include a  <b>DSN</b>  option  specifying  the
              data source to remove.

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>tdbc::odbc::connection</b>  <b>create</b>  object  command  supports  the  <b>-encoding</b>, <b>-isolation</b>, <b>-readonly</b> and
       <b>-timeout</b> options common to all TDBC drivers. The <b>-encoding</b> option will  succeed  only  if  the  requested
       encoding is the same as the system encoding; <b>tdbc::odbc</b> does not attempt to specify alternative encodings
       to an ODBC driver. (Some drivers accept encoding specifications in the connection string.)

       In  addition,  if Tk is present in the requesting interpreter, and the local system's ODBC driver manager
       supports a graphical user interface, the <b>tdbc::odbc::connection</b> <b>create</b> object command supports a  <b>-parent</b>
       option, whose value is the path name of a Tk window. If this option is specified, and a connection string
       does  not  specify  all  the  information needed to connect to an interface, the ODBC driver manager will
       display a dialog box to request whatever additional information is required. The  requesting  interpreter
       will block until the user dismisses the dialog, at which point the connection is made.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Sincs ODBC connection strings are driver specific, it is often difficult to find the documentation needed
       to  compose them. The following examples are known to work on most Windows systems and provide at least a
       few useful things that a program can do.

              tdbc::odbc::connection create db \
                  "DSN={PAYROLL};UID={aladdin};PWD={Sesame}"
       Connects to a named data source "PAYROLL", providing "aladdin" as a user name and "Sesame" as a password.
       Uses <b>db</b> as the name of the connection.

              set connString {DRIVER={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};}
              append connString {FIL={MS Access}\;}
              append connString {DBQ=} \
                  [file nativename [file normalize $fileName]]
              tdbc::odbc::connection create db2 -readonly 1 $connString
       Opens a connection to a Microsoft Access database file whose name is in <u>$fileName</u>. The database is opened
       in read-only mode. The resulting connection is called "db2".

              tdbc::odbc::connection create db3 \
                  "DRIVER=SQLite3;DATABASE=$fileName"
       Opens a connection to a SQLite3 database whose name is in "$fileName".

              tdbc::odbc::datasource add \
                  {Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)} \
                  DSN=MyTestDatabase \
                  DBQ=[file native [file normalize $fileName]]
       Creates a new user data source with the name, "MyTestDatabase" bound to a  Microsoft  Access  file  whose
       path  name  is  in  "$fileName".  No  connection  is  made  to  the  data  source until the program calls
       <b>tdbc::odbc::connection</b> <b>create</b>.

              tdbc::odbc::datasource configure \
                  {Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)} \
                  CREATE_DB=[file native [file normalize $fileName]] \
                  General
       Creates a new, empty Microsoft Access database in the file identified by "$fileName".  No  connection  is
       made to the database until the program calls <b>tdbc::odbc::connection</b> <b>create</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ADDITIONAL</b> <b>CONNECTION</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       In  addition  to  the usual methods on the tdbc::<a href="../man3tcl/connection.3tcl.html">connection</a>(3tcl) object, connections to an ODBC database
       support one additional method:

       <u>$connection</u>
              This method takes the given driver-native SQL code <u>sqlStatement</u> and evaluates it without preparing
              it. The statement is not tokenized and must not contain variable  substitutions.   Evaluating  the
              <u>sqlStatement</u>  produces  a result set of zero or more rows.  The result of the command is a list of
              dictionaries, with one list element per row in the result set (in a similar  format  to  the  list
              returned  by  <u>$connection</u>  <u>allrows</u> <u>-as</u> <u>dicts</u>).  <u>This</u> <u>command</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>recommended</u> for anything where
              the usual <u>prepare</u> or <u>preparecall</u> methods work correctly. It is provided so  that  data  management
              language  statements  that  are  not  implemented  by the driver's prepared statement API (such as
              <b>CREATE</b> <b>DATABASE</b> or <b>CREATE</b> <b>PROCEDURE</b>),  or  that  contain  characters  that  are  reserved  by  the
              tokenizer, can be executed.
