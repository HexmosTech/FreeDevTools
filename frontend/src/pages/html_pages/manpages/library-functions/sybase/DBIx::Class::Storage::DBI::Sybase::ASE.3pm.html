</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Sybase::ASE - Sybase ASE SQL Server support for DBIx::Class

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This subclass supports DBD::Sybase for real (non-Microsoft) Sybase databases.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If your version of Sybase does not support placeholders, then your storage will be reblessed to
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Sybase::ASE::NoBindVars.  You can also enable that driver explicitly, see the
       documentation for more details.

       With this driver there is unfortunately no way to get the "last_insert_id" without doing a "SELECT
       MAX(col)". This is done safely in a transaction (locking the table.) See "INSERTS WITH PLACEHOLDERS".

       A recommended connect_info setting:

         on_connect_call =&gt; [['datetime_setup'], ['blob_setup', log_on_update =&gt; 0]]

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>connect_call_blob_setup</b>
       Used as:

         on_connect_call =&gt; [ [ 'blob_setup', log_on_update =&gt; 0 ] ]

       Does "$dbh-&gt;{syb_binary_images} = 1;" to return "IMAGE" data as raw binary instead of as a hex string.

       Recommended.

       Also sets the "log_on_update" value for blob write operations. The default is 1, but 0 is better if your
       database is configured for it.

       See "Handling IMAGE/TEXT data with <b>syb_ct_get_data()</b>/<b>syb_ct_send_data()</b>" in DBD::Sybase.

   <b>connect_call_datetime_setup</b>
       Used as:

         on_connect_call =&gt; 'datetime_setup'

       In connect_info to set:

         $dbh-&gt;syb_date_fmt('ISO_strict'); # output fmt: 2004-08-21T14:36:48.080Z
         $dbh-&gt;do('set dateformat mdy');   # input fmt:  08/13/1979 18:08:55.080

       This works for both "DATETIME" and "SMALLDATETIME" columns, note that "SMALLDATETIME" columns only have
       minute precision.

</pre><h4><b>Schema::Loader</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
       As of version 0.05000, DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader should work well with most versions of Sybase ASE.

</pre><h4><b>FreeTDS</b></h4><pre>
       This driver supports DBD::Sybase compiled against FreeTDS (&lt;<a href="http://www.freetds.org/">http://www.freetds.org/</a>&gt;) to the best of our
       ability, however it is recommended that you recompile DBD::Sybase against the Sybase Open Client
       libraries. They are a part of the Sybase ASE distribution:

       The Open Client FAQ is here: &lt;<a href="http://www.isug.com/Sybase_FAQ/ASE/section7.html">http://www.isug.com/Sybase_FAQ/ASE/section7.html</a>&gt;.

       Sybase ASE for Linux (which comes with the Open Client libraries) may be downloaded here:
       &lt;<a href="http://response.sybase.com/forms/ASE_Linux_Download">http://response.sybase.com/forms/ASE_Linux_Download</a>&gt;.

       To see if you're using FreeTDS run:

         perl -MDBI -le 'my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect($dsn, $user, $pass); print $dbh-&gt;{syb_oc_version}'

       It is recommended to set "tds version" for your ASE server to 5.0 in "/etc/freetds/freetds.conf".

       Some versions or configurations of the libraries involved will not support placeholders, in which case
       the storage will be reblessed to DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Sybase::ASE::NoBindVars.

       In some configurations, placeholders will work but will throw implicit type conversion errors for
       anything that's not expecting a string. In such a case, the "auto_cast" option from
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::AutoCast is automatically set, which you may enable on connection with
       connect_call_set_auto_cast.  The type info for the "CAST"s is taken from the "data_type" in
       DBIx::Class::ResultSource definitions in your Result classes, and are mapped to a Sybase type (if it
       isn't already) using a mapping based on SQL::Translator.

       In other configurations, placeholders will work just as they do with the Sybase Open Client libraries.

       Inserts or updates of TEXT/IMAGE columns will <b>NOT</b> work with FreeTDS.

</pre><h4><b>INSERTS</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>PLACEHOLDERS</b></h4><pre>
       With placeholders enabled, inserts are done in a transaction so that there are no concurrency issues with
       getting the inserted identity value using "SELECT MAX(col)", which is the only way to get the "IDENTITY"
       value in this mode.

       In addition, they are done on a separate connection so that it's possible to have active cursors when
       doing an insert.

       When using "DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Sybase::ASE::NoBindVars" transactions are unnecessary and not
       used, as there are no concurrency issues with SELECT @@IDENTITY which is a session variable.

</pre><h4><b>TRANSACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Due to limitations of the TDS protocol and DBD::Sybase, you cannot begin a transaction while there are
       active cursors, nor can you use multiple active cursors within a transaction. An active cursor is, for
       example, a ResultSet that has been executed using "next" or "first" but has not been exhausted or reset.

       For example, this will not work:

         $schema-&gt;txn_do(sub {
           my $rs = $schema-&gt;resultset('Book');
           while (my $result = $rs-&gt;next) {
             $schema-&gt;resultset('MetaData')-&gt;create({
               book_id =&gt; $result-&gt;id,
               ...
             });
           }
         });

       This won't either:

         my $first_row = $large_rs-&gt;first;
         $schema-&gt;txn_do(sub { ... });

       Transactions done for inserts in "AutoCommit" mode when placeholders are in use are not affected, as they
       are done on an extra database handle.

       Some workarounds:

       •   use DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated

       •   connect another Schema

       •   load the data from your cursor with "all" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet

</pre><h4><b>MAXIMUM</b> <b>CONNECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  TDS  protocol  makes  separate connections to the server for active statements in the background. By
       default the number of such connections is limited to 25, on both the client side and the server side.

       This is a bit too low for a complex DBIx::Class application, so on connection the client side setting  is
       set  to  256  (see  "maxConnect" in DBD::Sybase.) You can override it to whatever setting you like in the
       DSN.

       See
       &lt;<a href="http://infocenter.sybase.com/help/index.jsp">http://infocenter.sybase.com/help/index.jsp</a>?topic=/com.sybase.help.ase_15.0.sag1/html/sag1/sag1272.htm&gt;
       for information on changing the setting on the server side.

</pre><h4><b>DATES</b></h4><pre>
       See "connect_call_datetime_setup" to setup date formats for DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITED</b> <b>QUERIES</b></h4><pre>
       Because ASE does not have a good way to limit results in SQL that works for all  types  of  queries,  the
       limit dialect is set to GenericSubQ.

       Fortunately,  ASE  and  DBD::Sybase support cursors properly, so when GenericSubQ is too slow you can use
       the software_limit DBIx::Class::ResultSet attribute to simulate limited queries by skipping over records.

</pre><h4><b>TEXT/IMAGE</b> <b>COLUMNS</b></h4><pre>
       DBD::Sybase compiled with FreeTDS will <b>NOT</b> allow you to insert or update "TEXT/IMAGE" columns.

       Setting "$dbh-&gt;{LongReadLen}" will also not work with FreeTDS use either:

         $schema-&gt;storage-&gt;dbh-&gt;do("SET TEXTSIZE $bytes");

       or

         $schema-&gt;storage-&gt;set_textsize($bytes);

       instead.

       However, the "LongReadLen" you pass in connect_info is used to  execute  the  equivalent  "SET  TEXTSIZE"
       command on connection.

       See "connect_call_blob_setup" for a connect_info setting you need to work with "IMAGE" columns.

</pre><h4><b>BULK</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       The experimental DBD::Sybase Bulk API support is used for populate in <b>void</b> context, in a transaction on a
       separate connection.

       To use this feature effectively, use a large number of rows for each populate call, eg.:

         while (my $rows = $data_source-&gt;get_100_rows()) {
           $rs-&gt;populate($rows);
         }

       <b>NOTE:</b>  the  add_columns  calls  in  your "Result" classes <b>must</b> list columns in database order for this to
       work. Also, you may have to unset the "LANG" environment variable before loading your app, as "BCP -Y" is
       not yet supported in DBD::Sybase .

       When inserting IMAGE columns using this method, you'll need to use "connect_call_blob_setup" as well.

</pre><h4><b>COMPUTED</b> <b>COLUMNS</b></h4><pre>
       If you have columns such as:

         created_dtm AS getdate()

       represent them in your Result classes as:

         created_dtm =&gt; {
           data_type =&gt; undef,
           default_value =&gt; \'getdate()',
           is_nullable =&gt; 0,
           inflate_datetime =&gt; 1,
         }

       The "data_type" must exist and must be "undef". Then empty inserts will work on tables with such columns.

</pre><h4><b>TIMESTAMP</b> <b>COLUMNS</b></h4><pre>
       "timestamp"     columns     in     Sybase     ASE     are      not      really      timestamps,      see:
       &lt;<a href="http://dba.fyicenter.com/Interview-Questions/SYBASE/The_timestamp_datatype_in_Sybase_.html">http://dba.fyicenter.com/Interview-Questions/SYBASE/The_timestamp_datatype_in_Sybase_.html</a>&gt;.

       They should be defined in your Result classes as:

         ts =&gt; {
           data_type =&gt; 'timestamp',
           is_nullable =&gt; 0,
           inflate_datetime =&gt; 0,
         }

       The  "&lt;inflate_datetime  ="  0&gt;&gt;  is  necessary if you use DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime, and most
       people do, and still want to be able to read these values.

       The values will come back as hexadecimal.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       •   Transitions to AutoCommit=0 (starting a transaction) mode by exhausting  any  active  cursors,  using
           eager cursors.

       •   Real limits and limited counts using stored procedures deployed on startup.

       •   Blob update with a LIKE query on a blob, without invalidating the WHERE condition.

       •   bulk_insert using prepare_cached (see comments.)
