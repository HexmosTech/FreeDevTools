</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DBD::Sybase - Sybase database driver for the DBI module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use DBI;

           $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:", $user, $passwd);

           # See the DBI module documentation for full details

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       DBD::Sybase is a Perl module which works with the DBI module to provide access to Sybase databases.

</pre><h4><b>Connecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>Sybase</b></h4><pre>
   <b>The</b> <b>interfaces</b> <b>file</b>
       The DBD::Sybase module is built on top of the Sybase <u>Open</u> <u>Client</u> <u>Client</u> <u>Library</u> API. This library makes
       use of the Sybase <u>interfaces</u> file (<u>sql.ini</u> on Win32 machines) to make a link between a logical server
       name (e.g. SYBASE) and the physical machine / port number that the server is running on. The OpenClient
       library uses the environment variable <b>SYBASE</b> to find the location of the <u>interfaces</u> file, as well as
       other files that it needs (such as locale files). The <b>SYBASE</b> environment is the path to the Sybase
       installation (eg '/usr/local/sybase').  If you need to set it in your scripts, then you <u>must</u> set it in a
       "BEGIN{}" block:

          BEGIN {
              $ENV{SYBASE} = '/opt/sybase/11.0.2';
          }

          my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:Sybase:', $user, $passwd);

   <b>Specifying</b> <b>the</b> <b>server</b> <b>name</b>
       The server that DBD::Sybase connects to defaults to <u>SYBASE</u>, but can be specified in two ways.

       You can set the <u>DSQUERY</u> environement variable:

           $ENV{DSQUERY} = "ENGINEERING";
           $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:Sybase:', $user, $passwd);

       Or you can pass the server name in the first argument to <b>connect()</b>:

           $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:server=ENGINEERING", $user, $passwd);

   <b>Specifying</b> <b>other</b> <b>connection</b> <b>specific</b> <b>parameters</b>
       It is sometimes necessary (or beneficial) to specify other connection properties. Currently the following
       are supported:

       server
           Specify the server that we should connect to.

                $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:server=BILLING",
                                    $user, $passwd);

           The default server is <u>SYBASE</u>, or the value of the <u>$DSQUERY</u> environment variable, if it is set.

       host
       port
           If  you  built DBD::Sybase with OpenClient 12.5.1 or later, then you can use the <u>host</u> and <u>port</u> values
           to define the server you want to connect to.  This  will  by-pass  the  server  name  lookup  in  the
           interfaces  file.   This is useful in the case where the server hasn't been entered in the interfaces
           file.

                $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:host=db1.domain.com;port=4100",
                                    $user, $passwd);

       maxConnect
           By default DBD::Sybase  (and  the  underlying  OpenClient  libraries)  is  limited  to  openening  25
           simultaneous  connections  to  one or more database servers.  If you need more than 25 connections at
           the same time, you can use the <u>maxConnect</u> option to increase this number.

                $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:maxConnect=100",
                                    $user, $passwd);

       database
           Specify the database that should be made the default database.

                $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:database=sybsystemprocs",
                                    $user, $passwd);

           This is equivalent to

               $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:Sybase:', $user, $passwd);
               $dbh-&gt;do("use sybsystemprocs");

       charset
           Specify the character set that the client uses.

                $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:charset=iso_1",
                                    $user, $passwd);

           The default charset used depends on the locale that the application runs in. If you wish to  interact
           with  unicode  varaiables (see syb_enable_utf8, below) then you should set charset=utf8. Note however
           that this means that Sybase will expect all data sent to it for char/varchar columns to be encoded in
           utf8 (e.g. sending iso8859-1 characters like e-grave, etc).

       language
           Specify the language that the client uses.

                $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:language=us_english",
                                    $user, $passwd);

           Note that the language has to have been installed on the server (via langinstall  or  sp_addlanguage)
           for  this  to work. If the language is not installed the session will default to the default language
           of the server.

       packetSize
           Specify the network packet size that the connection should  use.  Using  a  larger  packet  size  can
           increase  performance  for  certain  types of queries.  See the Sybase documentation on how to enable
           this feature on the server.

                $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:packetSize=8192",
                                    $user, $passwd);

       interfaces
           Specify the location of an alternate <u>interfaces</u> file:

                $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:interfaces=/usr/local/sybase/interfaces",
                                    $user, $passwd);

       loginTimeout
           Specify the number of seconds that DBI-&gt;<b>connect()</b> will wait for a response from the Sybase server. If
           the server fails to respond before the specified number of seconds the DBI-&gt;<b>connect()</b> call fails with
           a timeout error. The default value is 60 seconds, which is usually enough, but on a busy server it is
           sometimes necessary to increase this value:

                $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:loginTimeout=240", # wait up to 4 minutes
                                    $user, $passwd);

       timeout
           Specify the number of seconds after which any Open Client calls will timeout the connection and  mark
           it  as dead. Once a timeout error has been received on a connection it should be closed and re-opened
           for further processing.

           Setting this value to 0 or a negative number will result in an unlimited timeout value. See also  the
           Open Client documentation on CS_TIMEOUT.

                $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:timeout=240", # wait up to 4 minutes
                                    $user, $passwd);

       scriptName
           Specify  the  name for this connection that will be displayed in sp_who (ie in the sysprocesses table
           in the <u>program_name</u> column).

               $dbh=DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:scriptName=myScript", $user, $password);

       hostname
           Specify the hostname that will be displayed by sp_who (and will be stored in the hostname  column  of
           sysprocesses)..

               $dbh=DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:hostname=kiruna", $user, $password);

       tdsLevel
           Specify  the  TDS  protocol  level to use when connecting to the server.  Valid values are CS_TDS_40,
           CS_TDS_42, CS_TDS_46, CS_TDS_495 and CS_TDS_50.  In general this is automatically negotiated  between
           the  client  and  the server, but in certain cases this may need to be forced to a lower level by the
           client.

               $dbh=DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:tdsLevel=CS_TDS_42", $user, $password);

           <b>NOTE</b>: Setting the tdsLevel below CS_TDS_495 will disable a number of features,  ?-style  placeholders
           and CHAINED non-AutoCommit mode, in particular.

       encryptPassword
           Specify  the  use of the client password encryption supported by CT-Lib.  Specify a value of 1 to use
           encrypted passwords. Set to a value &gt; 1 to also enable asymetric password encryption.

               $dbh=DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:encryptPassword=1", $user, $password);

       kerberos
           Note: Requires OpenClient 11.1.1 or later.

           Sybase and OpenClient can use Kerberos to perform network-based  login.   If  you  use  Kerberos  for
           authentication   you   can   use   this  feature  and  pass  a  kerberos  serverprincipal  using  the
           "kerberos=value" parameter:

               $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:kerberos=$serverprincipal", '', '');

           In addition, if you have a system for retrieving Kerberos serverprincipals at run-time you  can  tell
           DBD::Sybase to call a perl subroutine to get the serverprincipal from <b>connect()</b>:

               sub sybGetPrinc {
                   my $srv = shift;
                   return the serverprincipal...
               }
               $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:Sybase:server=troll', '', '', { syb_kerberos_serverprincipal =&gt; \&amp;sybGetPrinc });

           The subroutine will be called with one argument (the server that we will connect to, using the normal
           Sybase  behavior  of  checking  the  DSQUERY  environment  variable  if no server is specified in the
           <b>connect()</b>) and is expected to return a string (the Kerberos serverprincipal) to the caller.

       sslCAFile
           Specify the location of an alternate <u>trusted.txt</u> file for SSL connection negotiation:

             $dbh-&gt;DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:sslCAFile=/usr/local/sybase/trusted.txt.ENGINEERING", $user, $password);

       bulkLogin
           Set this to 1 if the connection is going to be used for a bulk-load operation (see <u>Experimental</u> <u>Bulk-</u>
           <u>Load</u> <u>functionality</u> elsewhere in this document.)

             $dbh-&gt;DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:bulkLogin=1", $user, $password);

       serverType
           Tell DBD::Sybase what the server type is. Defaults to ASE. Setting it to something else will  prevent
           certain  actions  (such  as  setting options, fetching the ASE version via @@version, etc.) and avoid
           spurious errors.

       tds_keepalive
           Set this to 1 to tell OpenClient to enable the KEEP_ALIVE attribute on the connection. Default 1.

       These different parameters (as well as the server name) can be strung together by separating  each  entry
       with a semi-colon:

           $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:server=ENGINEERING;packetSize=8192;language=us_english;charset=iso_1",
                               $user, $pwd);

</pre><h4><b>Handling</b> <b>Multiple</b> <b>Result</b> <b>Sets</b></h4><pre>
       Sybase's  Transact  SQL  has  the ability to return multiple result sets from a single SQL statement. For
       example the query:

           select b.title, b.author, s.amount
             from books b, sales s
            where s.authorID = b.authorID
            order by b.author, b.title
           compute sum(s.amount) by b.author

       which lists sales by author and title and also computes the total sales by author returns  two  types  of
       rows. The DBI spec doesn't really handle this situation, nor the more hairy

           exec my_proc @p1='this', @p2='that', @p3 out

       where "my_proc" could return any number of result sets (ie it could perform an unknown number of "select"
       statements.

       I've  decided  to  handle  this by returning an empty row at the end of each result set, and by setting a
       special Sybase attribute in $sth which you can check to see if there is more  data  to  be  fetched.  The
       attribute is <b>syb_more_results</b> which you should check to see if you need to re-start the fetch() loop.

       To make sure all results are fetched, the basic "fetch" loop can be written like this:

            {
                while($d = $sth-&gt;fetch) {
                   ... do something with the data
                }

                redo if $sth-&gt;{syb_more_results};
            }

       You  can  get  the  type of the current result set with $sth-&gt;{syb_result_type}. This returns a numerical
       value, as defined in $SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/include/cspublic.h:

               #define CS_ROW_RESULT           (CS_INT)4040
               #define CS_CURSOR_RESULT        (CS_INT)4041
               #define CS_PARAM_RESULT         (CS_INT)4042
               #define CS_STATUS_RESULT        (CS_INT)4043
               #define CS_MSG_RESULT           (CS_INT)4044
               #define CS_COMPUTE_RESULT       (CS_INT)4045

       In particular, the return status of a stored procedure is returned as  CS_STATUS_RESULT  (4043),  and  is
       normally  the last result set that is returned in a stored proc execution, but see the <b>syb_do_proc_status</b>
       attribute for an alternative way of handling this result type. See <b>Executing</b> <b>Stored</b> <b>Procedures</b>  elsewhere
       in this document for more information.

       If you add a

           use DBD::Sybase;

       to your script then you can use the symbolic values (CS_xxx_RESULT) instead of the numeric values in your
       programs, which should make them easier to read.

       See  also  the  "$sth-"syb_output_params&gt;  call  to  handle  stored  procedures  that  <b>only</b> return <b>OUTPUT</b>
       parameters.

</pre><h4><b>$sth-&gt;execute()</b> <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> <b>behavior</b></h4><pre>
       DBD::Sybase has the ability to handle multi-statement SQL commands in a single batch.  For  example,  you
       could insert several rows in a single batch like this:

          $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("
          insert foo(one, two, three) values(1, 2, 3)
          insert foo(one, two, three) values(4, 5, 6)
          insert foo(one, two, three) values(10, 11, 12)
          insert foo(one, two, three) values(11, 12, 13)
          ");
          $sth-&gt;execute;

       If  any one of the above inserts fails for any reason then $sth-&gt;execute will return "undef", <b>HOWEVER</b> the
       inserts that didn't fail will still be in the database, unless "AutoCommit" is off.

       It's also possible to write a statement like this:

          $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("
          insert foo(one, two, three) values(1, 2, 3)
          select * from bar
          insert foo(one, two, three) values(10, 11, 12)
          ");
          $sth-&gt;execute;

       If the second "insert" is the one that fails, then $sth-&gt;execute will <b>NOT</b> return "undef". The error  will
       get flagged after the rows from "bar" have been fetched.

       I know that this is not as intuitive as it could be, but I am constrained by the Sybase API here.

       As  an  aside,  I  know  that  the example above doesn't really make sense, but I need to illustrate this
       particular sequence... You can also see the t/fail.t test script which shows this particular behavior.

</pre><h4><b>Sybase</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Attributes</b></h4><pre>
       There are a number of handle  attributes that are specific to this driver.  These  attributes  all  start
       with <b>syb_</b> so as to not clash with any normal DBI attributes.

   <b>Database</b> <b>Handle</b> <b>Attributes</b>
       The following Sybase specific attributes can be set at the Database handle level:

       syb_show_sql (bool)
           If set then the current statement is included in the string returned by $dbh-&gt;errstr.

       syb_show_eed (bool)
           If  set, then extended error information is included in the string returned by $dbh-&gt;errstr. Extended
           error information include the index causing a duplicate insert to fail, for example.

       syb_err_handler (subroutine ref)
           This attribute is used to set an ad-hoc error handler callback  (ie  a  perl  subroutine)  that  gets
           called before the normal error handler does it's job.  If this subroutine returns 0 then the error is
           ignored. This is useful for handling PRINT statements in Transact-SQL, for handling messages from the
           Backup Server, showplan output, dbcc output, etc.

           The subroutine is called with nine parameters:

             o the Sybase error number
             o the severity
             o the state
             o the line number in the SQL batch
             o the server name (if available)
             o the stored procedure name (if available)
             o the message text
             o the current SQL command buffer
             o either of the strings "client" (for Client Library errors) or
               "server" (for server errors, such as SQL syntax errors, etc),
               allowing you to identify the error type.

           As  a  contrived  example,  here is a port of the distinct error and message handlers from the Sybase
           documentation:

             Example:

             sub err_handler {
                 my($err, $sev, $state, $line, $server,
                   $proc, $msg, $sql, $err_type) = @_;

                 my @msg = ();
                 if($err_type eq 'server') {
                    push @msg,
                      ('',
                       'Server message',
                       sprintf('Message number: %ld, Severity %ld, State %ld, Line %ld',
                               $err,$sev,$state,$line),
                       (defined($server) ? "Server '$server' " : '') .
                       (defined($proc) ? "Procedure '$proc'" : ''),
                       "Message String:$msg");
                 } else {
                    push @msg,
                      ('',
                       'Open Client Message:',
                       sprintf('Message number: SEVERITY = (%ld) NUMBER = (%ld)',
                               $sev, $err),
                       "Message String: $msg");
                 }
                 print STDERR join("\n",@msg);
                 return 0; ## CS_SUCCEED
             }

           In a simpler and more focused example, this error handler traps showplan messages:

              %showplan_msgs = map { $_ =&gt; 1}  (3612 .. 3615, 6201 .. 6299, 10201 .. 10299);
              sub err_handler {
                 my($err, $sev, $state, $line, $server,
                   $proc, $msg, $sql, $err_type) = @_;

                  if($showplan_msgs{$err}) { # it's a showplan message
                    print SHOWPLAN "$err - $msg\n";
                    return 0;    # This is not an error
                  }
                  return 1;
              }

           and this is how you would use it:

               $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:Sybase:server=troll', 'sa', '');
               $dbh-&gt;{syb_err_handler} = \&amp;err_handler;
               $dbh-&gt;do("set showplan on");
               open(SHOWPLAN, "&gt;&gt;/var/tmp/showplan.log") || die "Can't open showplan log: $!";
               $dbh-&gt;do("exec someproc");    # get the showplan trace for this proc.
               $dbh-&gt;disconnect;

           <b>NOTE</b> - if you set the error handler in the DBI-&gt;<b>connect()</b> call like this

               $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:Sybase:server=troll', 'sa', '',
                               { syb_err_handler =&gt; \&amp;err_handler });

           then the <b>err_handler()</b> routine will get called if there is an error during
                  the connect itself. This is <b>new</b> behavior in DBD::Sybase 0.95.

       syb_flush_finish (bool)
           If $dbh-&gt;{syb_flush_finish} is set then $dbh-&gt;finish will drain any results remaining for the current
           command by actually fetching them.  The default behaviour is to issue a ct_cancel(CS_CANCEL_ALL), but
           this <u>appears</u> to cause connections to hang or to fail in certain cases (although I've never  witnessed
           this  myself.)   I  would  recommend  leaving this set to the default value unless this really causes
           issues.

       syb_dynamic_supported (bool)
           This is a read-only attribute that returns TRUE if the  dataserver  you  are  connected  to  supports
           ?-style placeholders. Typically placeholders are not supported when using DBD::Sybase to connect to a
           MS-SQL server.

       syb_chained_txn (bool)
           If set then we use CHAINED transactions when AutoCommit is off.  Otherwise we issue an explicit BEGIN
           TRAN as needed. The default is on if it is supported by the server.

           This attribute should usually be used only during the <b>connect()</b> call:

               $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:Sybase:', $user, $pwd, {syb_chained_txn =&gt; 1});

           Using it at any other time with <b>AutoCommit</b> turned <b>off</b> will <b>force</b> <b>a</b> <b>commit</b> on the current handle.

       syb_quoted_identifier (bool)
           If  set,  then  identifiers  that would normally clash with Sybase reserved words can be quoted using
           "identifier". In this case strings must be quoted with the single quote.

           This attribute can only be set if the database handle is idle (no active statement handle.)

           Default is for this attribute to be <b>off</b>.

       syb_rowcount (int)
           Setting this attribute to non-0 will limit the number of rows returned by a <u>SELECT</u>, or affected by an
           <u>UPDATE</u> or <u>DELETE</u> statement to the <u>rowcount</u> value. Setting it back to 0 clears the limit.

           This attribute can only be set if the database handle is idle.

           Default is for this attribute to be <b>0</b>.

       syb_do_proc_status (bool)
           Setting this attribute causes $sth-&gt;<b>execute()</b> to fetch the return status of any executed stored procs
           in the SQL being executed. If the return status is non-0 then $sth-&gt;<b>execute()</b> will  report  that  the
           operation failed.

           <b>NOTE</b>  The  result status is NOT the first result set that is fetched from a stored proc execution. If
           the procedure includes SELECT  statements  then  these  will  be  fetched  first,  which  means  that
           "$sth-"execute&gt;  will  NOT  return  a  failure in that case as DBD::Sybase won't have seen the result
           status yet at that point.

           The RaiseError will NOT be triggered by a non-0 return status if  there  isn't  an  associated  error
           message  either generated by Sybase (duplicate insert error, etc) or generated in the procedure via a
           T-SQL "raiserror" statement.

           Setting this attribute does <b>NOT</b> affect existing $sth handles,  only  those  that  are  created  after
           setting it. To change the behavior of an existing $sth handle use $sth-&gt;{syb_do_proc_status}.

           The  proc  status  is available in $sth-&gt;{syb_proc_status} after all the result sets in the procedure
           have been processed.

           The default is for this attribute to be <b>off</b>.

       syb_use_bin_0x
           If set, BINARY and VARBINARY values are prefixed with '0x' in the result. The default is off.

       syb_binary_images
           If set, IMAGE data is returned in raw binary format. Otherwise the data is converted to  a  long  hex
           string. The default is off.

       syb_oc_version (string)
           Returns  the  identification  string  of  the version of Client Library that this binary is currently
           using. This is a read-only attribute.

           For example:

               troll (7:59AM):348 &gt; perl -MDBI -e '$dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Sybase:", "sa"); print "$dbh-&gt;{syb_oc_version}\n";'
               Sybase Client-Library/11.1.1/P/Linux Intel/Linux 2.2.5 i586/1/OPT/Mon Jun  7 07:50:21 1999

           This is very useful information to have when reporting a problem.

       syb_server_version
       syb_server_version_string
           These two attributes return the Sybase server version, respectively version string, and can  be  used
           to turn server-specific functionality on or off.

           Example:

               print "$dbh-&gt;{syb_server_version}\n$dbh-&gt;{syb_server_version_string}\n";

           prints

               12.5.2
               Adaptive Server Enterprise/12.5.2/EBF 12061 ESD#2/P/Linux Intel/Enterprise Linux/ase1252/1844/32-bit/OPT/Wed Aug 11 21:36:26 2004

       syb_failed_db_fatal (bool)
           If  this  is  set,  then  a  <b>connect()</b>  request  where the <u>database</u> specified doesn't exist or is not
           accessible will fail. This needs to be set in the attribute hash  passed  during  the  DBI-&gt;<b>connect()</b>
           call to be effective.

           Default: off

       syb_no_child_con (bool)
           If  this  attribute  is  set then DBD::Sybase will <b>not</b> allow multiple simultaneously active statement
           handles on one database handle (i.e.  multiple $dbh-&gt;<b>prepare()</b> calls  without  completely  processing
           the results from any existing statement handle). This can be used to debug situations where incorrect
           or  unexpected  results  are  found  due  to  the  creation  of a sub-connection where the connection
           attributes (in particular the current database) are different.

           Default: off

       syb_bind_empty_string_as_null (bool)
           If this attribute is set then an empty string (i.e. "") passed as a parameter to  an  $sth-&gt;<b>execute()</b>
           call will be converted to a NULL value. If the attribute is not set then an empty string is converted
           to a single space.

           Default: off

       syb_cancel_request_on_error (bool)
           If this attribute is set then a failure in a multi-statement request (for example, a stored procedure
           execution)  will  cause $sth-&gt;<b>execute()</b> to return failure, and will cause any other results from this
           request to be discarded.

           The default value (<b>on</b>) changes the behavior that DBD::Sybase exhibited up to version 0.94.

           Default: on

       syb_date_fmt (string)
           Defines the date/time conversion string when fetching data. See  the  entry  for  the  syb_date_fmt()
           method elsewhere in this document for a description of the available formats.

       syb_has_blk (bool)
           This read-only attribute is set to TRUE if the BLK API is available in this version of DBD::Sybase.

       syb_disconnect_in_child (bool)
           Sybase  client  library allows using opened connections across a fork (i.e. the opened connection can
           be used in the child process). DBI by default will set flags such that this connection will be closed
           when the child process terminates. This is in  most  cases  not  what  you  want.  DBI  provides  the
           InactiveDestroy attribute to control this, but you have to set this attribute manually as it defaults
           to   False   (i.e.   when  DESTROY  is  called  for  the  handle  the  connection  is  closed).   The
           syb_disconnect_in_child attribute attempts to correct this - the default is for this attribute to  be
           False  -  thereby  inhibitting  the  closing of the connection(s) when the current process ID doesn't
           match the process ID that created the connection.

           Default: off

       syb_enable_utf8 (bool)
           If this attribute is set then DBD::Sybase will convert  UNIVARCHAR,  UNICHAR,  and  UNITEXT  data  to
           Perl's  internal  utf-8 encoding when they are retrieved. Updating a unicode column will cause Sybase
           to convert any incoming data from utf-8 to its internal utf-16 encoding.

           This feature requires OpenClient 15.x to work.

           Default: off

   <b>Statement</b> <b>Handle</b> <b>Attributes</b>
       The following read-only attributes are available at the statement level:

       syb_more_results (bool)
           See the discussion on handling multiple result sets above.

       syb_result_type (int)
           Returns the numeric result type of the current result set. Useful when executing stored procedurs  to
           determine  what  type  of  information is currently fetchable (normal select rows, output parameters,
           status results, etc...).

       syb_do_proc_status (bool)
           See above (under Database Handle Attributes) for an explanation.

       syb_proc_status (read-only)
           If syb_do_proc_status is set, then the return status of  stored  procedures  will  be  available  via
           $sth-&gt;{syb_proc_status}.

       syb_no_bind_blob (bool)
           If  set  then  any IMAGE or TEXT columns in a query are <b>NOT</b> returned when calling $sth-&gt;fetch (or any
           variation).

           Instead, you would use

               $sth-&gt;syb_ct_get_data($column, \$data, $size);

           to retrieve the IMAGE or TEXT data. If $size is 0 then the entire item is fetched, otherwis  you  can
           call this in a loop to fetch chunks of data:

               <a href="../man1/while.1.html">while</a>(1) {
                   $sth-&gt;syb_ct_get_data($column, \$data, 1024);
                   last unless $data;
                   print OUT $data;
               }

           The  fetched  data  is  still  subject to Sybase's TEXTSIZE option (see the SET command in the Sybase
           reference   manual).   This   can   be   manipulated   with   DBI's   <b>LongReadLen</b>   attribute,    but
           "$dbh-"{LongReadLen}&gt;  <u>must</u>  be set before $dbh-&gt;<b>prepare()</b> is called to take effect (this is a change
           in 1.05 - previously you could call it after the <b>prepare()</b>  but  before  the  <b>execute()</b>).  Note  that
           LongReadLen has no effect when using DBD::Sybase with an MS-SQL server.

           <b>Note</b>: The IMAGE or TEXT column that is to be fetched this way <u>must</u> be <u>last</u> in the select list.

           See  also  the  description  of  the  <b>ct_get_data()</b> API call in the Sybase OpenClient manual, and the
           "Working with TEXT/IMAGE columns" section elsewhere in this document.

</pre><h4><b>Controlling</b> <b>DATETIME</b> <b>output</b> <b>formats</b></h4><pre>
       By default DBD::Sybase will return <u>DATETIME</u> and <u>SMALLDATETIME</u> columns in the <u>Nov</u> <u>15</u> <u>1998</u> <u>11:13AM</u>  format.
       This can be changed via a private <b>syb_date_fmt()</b> method.

       The syntax is

           $dbh-&gt;syb_date_fmt($fmt);

       where $fmt is a string representing the format that you want to apply.

       Note that this requires DBI 1.37 or later.

       The formats are based on Sybase's standard conversion routines. The following subset of available formats
       has been implemented:

       LONG
           Nov 15 1998 11:30:11:496AM

       LONGMS
           New with ASE 15.5 - for bigtime/bigdatetime datatypes, includes microseconds:

           Apr  7 2010 10:40:33.532315PM

       SHORT
           Nov 15 1998 11:30AM

       DMY4_YYYY
           15 Nov 1998

       MDY1_YYYY
           11/15/1998

       DMY1_YYYY
           15/11/1998

       DMY2_YYYY
           15.11.1998

       YMD3_YYYY
           19981115

       HMS 11:30:11

       ISO 2004-08-21 14:36:48.080

       ISO_strict
           2004-08-21T14:36:48.080Z

           Note  that  Sybase  has  no concept of a timezone, so the trailing "Z" is really not correct (assumes
           that the time is in UTC). However, there is no guarantee that the client and the server  run  in  the
           same timezone, so assuming the timezone of the client isn't really a valid option either.

</pre><h4><b>Retrieving</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>from</b> <b>stored</b> <b>procedures</b></h4><pre>
       Sybase  lets  you  pass define <b>OUTPUT</b> parameters to stored procedures, which are a little like parameters
       passed by reference in C (or perl.)

       In Transact-SQL this is done like this

          declare @id_value int, @id_name <a href="../man10/char.10.html">char</a>(10)
          exec my_proc @name = 'a string', @number = 1234, @id = @id_value OUTPUT, @out_name = @id_name OUTPUT
          -- Now @id_value and @id_name are set to whatever 'my_proc' set @id and @out_name to

       So how can we get at @param using DBD::Sybase?

       If your stored procedure <b>only</b> returns <b>OUTPUT</b> parameters, then you can use this shorthand:

           $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare('...');
           $sth-&gt;execute;
           @results = $sth-&gt;syb_output_params();

       This will return an array for all the OUTPUT parameters in the proc  call,  and  will  ignore  any  other
       results. The array will be undefined if there are no OUTPUT params, or if the stored procedure failed for
       some reason.

       The more generic way looks like this:

          $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("declare \@id_value int, \@id_name
             exec my_proc @name = 'a string', @number = 1234, @id = @id_value OUTPUT, @out_name = @id_name OUTPUT");
          $sth-&gt;execute;
          {
             while($d = $sth-&gt;fetch) {
                if($sth-&gt;{syb_result_type} == 4042) { # it's a PARAM result
                   $id_value = $d-&gt;[0];
                   $id_name  = $d-&gt;[1];
                }
             }

             redo if $sth-&gt;{syb_more_results};
          }

       So the OUTPUT params are returned as one row in a special result set.

</pre><h4><b>Multiple</b> <b>active</b> <b>statements</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>$dbh</b></h4><pre>
       It  is possible to open multiple active statements on a single database handle. This is done by opening a
       new physical connection in $dbh-&gt;<b>prepare()</b> if there is already an active statement handle for this $dbh.

       This feature has been implemented to improve compatibility with other drivers, but should not be used  if
       you are coding directly to the Sybase driver.

       The  "syb_no_child_con"  attribute  controls  whether  this  feature  is  turned  on. If it is FALSE (the
       default), then multiple statement handles are supported. If it is TRUE then multiple  statements  on  the
       same database handle are disabled. Also see below for interaction with AutoCommit.

       If  AutoCommit is <b>OFF</b> then multiple statement handles on a single $dbh is <b>NOT</b> supported. This is to avoid
       various deadlock problems that can crop up  in  this  situation,  and  because  you  will  not  get  real
       transactional  integrity  using  multiple  statement  handles simultaneously as these in reality refer to
       different physical connections.

   <b>prepare_cached</b>
       DBD::Sybase maps <b>prepare_cached()</b> to <b>prepare()</b> to avoid possible issues with having  a  statement  handle
       being kept active outside of the driver's control.

       DBD::Sybase  (and  the  underlying  TDS  protocol) doesn't easily support having more than one active SQL
       statement on a given connection (database handle). Caching a statement handle is only useful if it can be
       reused without reparsing and recompiling it, which is only  possible  with  Sybase  if  you  use  ?-style
       placeholders (see below).

       In  addition,  as  DBD::Sybase  will  attempt  to  emulate  the  ability to have more than one active SQL
       statement on a database handle by opening additional connections this has  significant  side  effects  on
       transaction management. See also the <b>syb_no_child_con</b> attribute.

</pre><h4><b>Working</b> <b>with</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>and</b> <b>TEXT</b> <b>columns</b></h4><pre>
       DBD::Sybase  can store and retrieve IMAGE or TEXT data (aka "blob" data) via standard SQL statements. The
       <b>LongReadLen</b> handle attribute controls the maximum size of IMAGE or TEXT data being returned for each data
       element.

       When using standard SQL the default for IMAGE data is to be converted to a hex string, but  you  can  use
       the <u>syb_binary_images</u> handle attribute to change this behaviour. Alternatively you can use something like

           $binary = pack("H*", $hex_string);

       to do the conversion.

       IMAGE  and  TEXT  datatypes  can <b>not</b> be passed as parameters using ?-style placeholders, and placeholders
       can't refer to IMAGE or TEXT columns (this is a limitation of the TDS protocol  used  by  Sybase,  not  a
       DBD::Sybase limitation.)

       There is an alternative way to access and update IMAGE/TEXT data using the natice OpenClient API. This is
       done via $h-&gt;<b>func()</b> calls, and is, unfortunately, a little convoluted.

   <b>Handling</b> <b>IMAGE/TEXT</b> <b>data</b> <b>with</b> <b>syb_ct_get_data()/syb_ct_send_data()</b>
       With  DBI 1.37 and later you can call all of these <b>ct_xxx()</b> calls directly as statement handle methods by
       prefixing them with syb_, so for example

           $sth-&gt;func($col, $dataref, $numbytes, 'ct_fetch_data');

       becomes

           $sth-&gt;syb_ct_fetch_data($col, $dataref, $numbytes);

       $len = ct_fetch_data($col, $dataref, $numbytes)
           The <b>ct_get_data()</b> call allows you to fetch IMAGE/TEXT data in raw format, either in one piece  or  in
           chunks. To use this function you must set the <u>syb_no_bind_blob</u> statement handle to <u>TRUE</u>.

           <b>ct_get_data()</b>  takes 3 parameters: The column number (starting at 1) of the query, a scalar ref and a
           byte count. If the byte count is 0 then we read as many bytes as possible.

           Note that the IMAGE/TEXT column <b>must</b> be <b>last</b> in the select list for this to work.

           The call sequence is:

               $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("select id, img from some_table where id = 1");
               $sth-&gt;{syb_no_bind_blob} = 1;
               $sth-&gt;execute;
               while($d = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref) {
                  # The data is in the second column
                  $len = $sth-&gt;syb_ct_get_data(2, \$img, 0);
                  # with DBI 1.33 and earlier, this would be
                  # $len = $sth-&gt;func(2, \$img, 0, 'ct_get_data');
               }

           <b>ct_get_data()</b> returns the number of bytes that were effectively fetched, so that when fetching chunks
           you can do something like this:

              <a href="../man1/while.1.html">while</a>(1) {
                 $len = $sth-&gt;syb_ct_get_data(2, $imgchunk, 1024);
                 ... do something with the $imgchunk ...
                 last if $len != 1024;
              }

           To explain further: Sybase stores IMAGE/TEXT data separately from normal table data, in  a  chain  of
           pagesize  blocks (a Sybase database page is defined at the server level, and can be 2k, 4k, 8k or 16k
           in size.) To update an IMAGE/TEXT column Sybase needs to find the head of this chain, which is  known
           as  the  "text  pointer".  As there is no <u>where</u> clause when the <b>ct_send_data()</b> API is used we need to
           retrieve the <u>text</u> <u>pointer</u> for the correct data item first, which is done via the ct_data_info(CS_GET)
           call. Subsequent <b>ct_send_data()</b> calls will then know which data item to update.

       $status = ct_data_info($action, $column, $attr)
           <b>ct_data_info()</b> is used to fetch or update the CS_IODESC structure for the IMAGE/TEXT data  item  that
           you  wish  to  update. $action should be one of "CS_SET" or "CS_GET", $column is the column number of
           the active select statement (ignored for a CS_SET operation) and $attr is a hash ref used to set  the
           values in the struct.

           <b>ct_data_info()</b>  must  be first called with CS_GET to fetch the CS_IODESC structure for the IMAGE/TEXT
           data item that you wish to update. Then you must update  the  value  of  the  <u>total_txtlen</u>  structure
           element  to the length (in bytes) of the IMAGE/TEXT data that you are going to insert, and optionally
           set the <u>log_on_update</u> to <b>TRUE</b> to enable full logging of the operation.

           ct_data_info(CS_GET) will <u>fail</u> if the IMAGE/TEXT data for which the CS_IODESC  is  being  fetched  is
           NULL.  If  you  have a NULL value that needs updating you must first update it to some non-NULL value
           (for example an empty string) using standard SQL before you can retrieve the  CS_IODESC  entry.  This
           actually  makes  sense  because as long as the data item is NULL there is <b>no</b> <u>text</u> <u>pointer</u> and no TEXT
           page chain for that item.

           See the <b>ct_send_data()</b> entry below for an example.

       <b>ct_prepare_send()</b>
           <b>ct_prepare_send()</b> must be called to initialize a IMAGE/TEXT write operation.  See the  <b>ct_send_data()</b>
           entry below for an example.

       <b>ct_finish_send()</b>
           <b>ct_finish_send()</b>  is  called  to finish/commit an IMAGE/TEXT write operation.  See the <b>ct_send_data()</b>
           entry below for an example.

       ct_send_data($image, $bytes)
           Send $bytes bytes of $image to the database. The request must have been set up via  <b>ct_prepare_send()</b>
           and <b>ct_data_info()</b> for this to work. <b>ct_send_data()</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> on success, and <b>FALSE</b> on failure.

           In  this  example,  we  wish to update the data in the <u>img</u> column where the <u>id</u> column is 1. We assume
           that DBI is at version 1.37 or later and use the direct method calls:

             # first we need to find the CS_IODESC data for the data
             $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("select img from imgtable where id = 1");
             $sth-&gt;execute;
             while($sth-&gt;fetch) {    # don't care about the data!
                 $sth-&gt;syb_ct_data_info('CS_GET', 1);
             }

             # OK - we have the CS_IODESC values, so do the update:
             $sth-&gt;syb_ct_prepare_send();
             # Set the size of the new data item (that we are inserting), and make
             # the operation unlogged
             $sth-&gt;syb_ct_data_info('CS_SET', 1, {total_txtlen =&gt; length($image), log_on_update =&gt; 0});
             # now transfer the data (in a single chunk, this time)
             $sth-&gt;syb_ct_send_data($image, length($image));
             # commit the operation
             $sth-&gt;syb_ct_finish_send();

           The <b>ct_send_data()</b> call can also transfer the data in chunks, however you must know the total size of
           the image before you start the insert. For example:

             # update a database entry with a new version of a file:
             my $size = -s $file;
             # first we need to find the CS_IODESC data for the data
             $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("select img from imgtable where id = 1");
             $sth-&gt;execute;
             while($sth-&gt;fetch) {    # don't care about the data!
                 $sth-&gt;syb_ct_data_info('CS_GET', 1);
             }

             # OK - we have the CS_IODESC values, so do the update:
             $sth-&gt;syb_ct_prepare_send();
             # Set the size of the new data item (that we are inserting), and make
             # the operation unlogged
             $sth-&gt;syb_ct_data_info('CS_SET', 1, {total_txtlen =&gt; $size, log_on_update =&gt; 0});

             # open the file, and store it in the db in 1024 byte chunks.
             open(IN, $file) || die "Can't open $file: $!";
             while($size) {
                 $to_read = $size &gt; 1024 ? 1024 : $size;
                 $bytesread = read(IN, $buff, $to_read);
                 $size -= $bytesread;

                 $sth-&gt;syb_ct_send_data($buff, $bytesread);
             }
             close(IN);
             # commit the operation
             $sth-&gt;syb_ct_finish_send();

</pre><h4><b>AutoCommit,</b> <b>Transactions</b> <b>and</b> <b>Transact-SQL</b></h4><pre>
       When $h-&gt;{AutoCommit} is <u>off</u> all data modification SQL statements that you  issue  (insert/update/delete)
       will only take effect if you call $dbh-&gt;commit.

       DBD::Sybase   implements   this   via   two   distinct   methods,   depending   on  the  setting  of  the
       $h-&gt;{syb_chained_txn} attribute and the version of the server that is being accessed.

       If $h-&gt;{syb_chained_txn} is <u>off</u>, then the DBD::Sybase driver will send a  <b>BEGIN</b>  <b>TRAN</b>  before  the  first
       $dbh-&gt;<b>prepare()</b>,  and  after  each  call to $dbh-&gt;<b>commit()</b> or $dbh-&gt;<b>rollback()</b>. This works fine, but will
       cause any SQL that contains any <u>CREATE</u> <u>TABLE</u> (or other  DDL)  statements  to  fail.  These  <u>CREATE</u>  <u>TABLE</u>
       statements  can be burried in a stored procedure somewhere (for example, "sp_helprotect" creates two temp
       tables when it is run).  You <u>can</u> get around this limit by setting  the  "ddl  in  tran"  option  (at  the
       database level, via "sp_dboption".) You should be aware that this can have serious effects on performance
       as this causes locks to be held on certain system tables for the duration of the transaction.

       If  $h-&gt;{syb_chained_txn}  is  <u>on</u>,  then  DBD::Sybase  sets the <u>CHAINED</u> option, which tells Sybase not to
       commit anything automatically.  Again, you will need to call $dbh-&gt;<b>commit()</b> to make any  changes  to  the
       data permanent.

</pre><h4><b>Behavior</b> <b>of</b> <b>$dbh-&gt;last_insert_id</b></h4><pre>
       This version of DBD::Sybase includes support for the <b>last_insert_id()</b> call, with the following caveats:

       The  <b>last_insert_id()</b> call is simply a wrapper around a "select @@identity" query. To be successful (i.e.
       to return the correct value) this must be executed on the same connection as the  INSERT  that  generated
       the new IDENTITY value. Therefore the statement handle that was used to perform the insert <b>must</b> have been
       closed/freed  before  <b>last_insert_id()</b> can be called. Otherwise <b>last_insert_id()</b> will be forced to open a
       different connection to perform the query, and will return an invalid value (usually in this case it will
       return 0).

       <b>last_insert_id()</b> ignores any parameters passed to it, and will  NOT  return  the  last  @@identity  value
       generated  in  the  case  where  placeholders were used, or where the insert was encapsulated in a stored
       procedure.

</pre><h4><b>Using</b> <b>?</b> <b>Placeholders</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>bind</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>to</b> <b>$sth-&gt;execute</b></h4><pre>
       DBD::Sybase supports the use of ? placeholders in SQL statements as long as the  underlying  library  and
       database  engine  supports  it.  It  does this by using what Sybase calls <u>Dynamic</u> <u>SQL</u>. The ? placeholders
       allow you to write something like:

               $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("select * from employee where empno = ?");

               # Retrieve rows from employee where empno == 1024:
               $sth-&gt;<a href="../man1024/execute.1024.html">execute</a>(1024);
               while($data = $sth-&gt;fetch) {
                   print "@$data\n";
               }

              # Now get rows where empno = 2000:

               $sth-&gt;<a href="../man2000/execute.2000.html">execute</a>(2000);
               while($data = $sth-&gt;fetch) {
                   print "@$data\n";
               }

       When you use ? placeholders Sybase goes and creates a temporary stored procedure that corresponds to your
       SQL statement. You then pass variables to $sth-&gt;execute or $dbh-&gt;do, which get inserted in the query, and
       any rows are returned.

       DBD::Sybase  uses   the   underlying   Sybase   API   calls   to   handle   ?-style   placeholders.   For
       select/insert/update/delete  statements  DBD::Sybase  calls  the  <b>ct_dynamic()</b>  family  of Client Library
       functions, which gives DBD::Sybase data type information for each parameter to the query.

       You can only use ?-style placeholders for  statements  that  return  a  single  result  set,  and  the  ?
       placeholders  can  only  appear  in  a  <b>WHERE</b> clause, in the <b>SET</b> clause of an <b>UPDATE</b> statement, or in the
       <b>VALUES</b> list of an <b>INSERT</b> statement.

       The DBI docs mention the following regarding NULL values and placeholders:

              Binding an `undef' (NULL) to the placeholder will not
              select rows which have a NULL `product_code'! Refer to the
              SQL manual for your database engine or any SQL book for
              the reasons for this.  To explicitly select NULLs you have
              to say "`WHERE product_code IS NULL'" and to make that
              general you have to say:

                ... WHERE (product_code = ? OR (? IS NULL AND product_code IS NULL))

              and bind the same value to both placeholders.

       This will <u>not</u> work with a Sybase database server. If you attempt the above construct  you  will  get  the
       following error:

           The datatype of a parameter marker used in the dynamic prepare statement could not be resolved.

       The  specific  problem  here  is  that  when  using ? placeholders the <b>prepare()</b> operation is sent to the
       database server for parameter resoltion. This extracts  the  datatypes  for  each  of  the  placeholders.
       Unfortunately  the  "? is null" construct doesn't tie the ? placeholder with an existing table column, so
       the database server can't find the data  type.  As  this  entire  operation  happens  inside  the  Sybase
       libraries there is no easy way for DBD::Sybase to work around it.

       Note  that  Sybase will normally handle the "foo = NULL" construct the same way that other systems handle
       "foo is NULL", so the convoluted construct that is described above is not necessary to obtain the correct
       results when querying a Sybase database.

       The underlying API does not support ?-style placeholders for stored procedures, but see  the  section  on
       titled <b>Stored</b> <b>Procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>Placeholders</b> elsewhere in this document.

       ?-style placeholders can <b>NOT</b> be used to pass TEXT or IMAGE data items to the server. This is a limitation
       of the TDS protocol, not of DBD::Sybase.

       There is also a performance issue: OpenClient creates stored procedures in tempdb for each <b>prepare()</b> call
       that  includes  ?  placeholders.  Creating  these  objects  requires updating system tables in the tempdb
       database, and can therefore create a performance hotspot if a lot of <b>prepare()</b> statements  from  multiple
       clients are executed simultaneously. This problem has been corrected for Sybase 11.9.x and later servers,
       as  they  create "lightweight" temporary stored procs which are held in the server memory cache and don't
       affect the system tables at all.

       In general however I find that if your application is going to run against Sybase it is better  to  write
       ad-hoc stored procedures rather than use the ? placeholders in embedded SQL.

       Out of curiosity I did some simple timings to see what the overhead of doing a prepare with ? placehoders
       is  vs. a straight SQL prepare and vs. a stored procedure prepare. Against an 11.0.3.3 server (linux) the
       placeholder prepare is significantly slower, and you need to do  ~30  <b>execute()</b>  calls  on  the  prepared
       statement  to  make  up for the overhead.  Against a 12.0 server (solaris) however the situation was very
       different, with placeholder <b>prepare()</b>  calls  <u>slightly</u>  faster  than  straight  SQL  <b>prepare()</b>.  This  is
       something that I <u>really</u> don't understand, but the numbers were pretty clear.

       In all cases stored proc <b>prepare()</b> calls were <u>clearly</u> faster, and consistently so.

       This test did not try to gauge concurrency issues, however.

       It  is  not  possible to retrieve the last <u>IDENTITY</u> value after an insert done with ?-style placeholders.
       This is a Sybase limitation/bug, not a DBD::Sybase problem.  For  example,  assuming  table  <u>foo</u>  has  an
       identity column:

         $dbh-&gt;do("insert foo(col1, col2) values(?, ?)", undef, "string1", "string2");
         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare('select @@identity')
           || die "Can't prepare the SQL statement: $DBI::errstr";
         $sth-&gt;execute || die "Can't execute the SQL statement: $DBI::errstr";

         #Get the data back.
         while (my $row = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref()) {
           print "IDENTITY value = $row-&gt;[0]\n";
         }

       will  always  return  an identity value of 0, which is obviously incorrect.  This behaviour is due to the
       fact that the handling of ?-style placeholders  is  implemented  using  temporary  stored  procedures  in
       Sybase,  and  the  value of @@identity is reset when the stored procedure has executed. Using an explicit
       stored procedure to do the insert and trying to retrieve @@identity after it has executed results in  the
       same behaviour.

       Please see the discussion on Dynamic SQL in the OpenClient C Programmer's Guide for details. The guide is
       available on-line at <a href="http://sybooks.sybase.com/">http://sybooks.sybase.com/</a>

</pre><h4><b>Calling</b> <b>Stored</b> <b>Procedures</b></h4><pre>
       DBD::Sybase  handles stored procedures in the same way as any other Transact-SQL statement. The only real
       difference is that Sybase stored procedures always return an extra result set with the <u>return</u> <u>status</u> from
       the proc which corresponds to the <u>return</u> statement in the stored procedure code. This result set  with  a
       single row is always returned last and has a result type of CS_STATUS_RESULT (4043).

       By  default  this  result set is returned like any other, but you can ask DBD::Sybase to process it under
       the covers via the $h-&gt;{syb_do_proc_status} attribute. If this attribute is  set  then  DBD::Sybase  will
       process the CS_STATUS_RESULT result set itself, place the return status value in $sth-&gt;{syb_proc_status},
       and  possibly  raise an error if the result set is different from 0. Note that a non-0 return status will
       <b>NOT</b> cause $sth-&gt;execute to return a failure code if the proc has at  least  one  other  result  set  that
       returned rows (reason: the rows are returned and fetched before the return status is seen).

   <b>Stored</b> <b>Procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>Placeholders</b>
       DBD::Sybase  has  the  ability  to  use  ?-style  placeholders  as  parameters  to stored proc calls. The
       requirements are that the stored procedure call be initiated with an "exec"  and  that  it  be  the  only
       statement in the batch that is being <b>prepared()</b>:

       For example, this prepares a stored proc call with named parameters:

           my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("exec my_proc \@p1 = ?, \@p2 = ?");
           $sth-&gt;execute('one', 'two');

       You can also use positional parameters:

           my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("exec my_proc ?, ?");
           $sth-&gt;execute('one', 'two');

       You may <u>not</u> mix positional and named parameter in the same prepare.

       You <u>can't</u> mix placeholder parameters and hard coded parameters. For example

           $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("exec my_proc \@p1 = 1, \@p2 = ?");

       will <u>not</u> work - because the @p1 parameter isn't parsed correctly and won't be sent to the server.

       You  can  specify  <u>OUTPUT</u>  parameters in the usual way, but you can <b>NOT</b> use <b>bind_param_inout()</b> to get the
       output result - instead you have to call <b>fetch()</b> and/or $sth-&gt;func('syb_output_params'):

           my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("exec my_proc \@p1 = ?, \@p2 = ?, \@p3 = ? OUTPUT ");
           $sth-&gt;execute('one', 'two', 'three');
           my (@data) = $sth-&gt;syb_output_params();

       DBD::Sybase does not attempt to figure out the correct parameter type for each  parameter  (it  would  be
       possible  to  do this for most cases, but there are enough exceptions that I preferred to avoid the issue
       for the time being).  DBD::Sybase  defaults  all  the  parameters  to  SQL_CHAR,  and  you  have  to  use
       <b>bind_param()</b> with an explicit type value to set this to something different. The type is then remembered,
       so you only need to use the explicit call once for each parameter:

           my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("exec my_proc \@p1 = ?, \@p2 = ?");
           $sth-&gt;bind_param(1, 'one', SQL_CHAR);
           $sth-&gt;bind_param(2, 2.34, SQL_FLOAT);
           $sth-&gt;execute;
           ....
           $sth-&gt;execute('two', 3.456);
           etc...

       Note that once a type has been defined for a parameter you can't change it.

       When  binding  SQL_NUMERIC  or  SQL_DECIMAL  data you may get fatal conversion errors if the scale or the
       precision exceeds the size of the target parameter definition.

       For example, consider the following stored proc definition:

           declare proc my_proc @p1 numeric(5,2) as...

       and the following prepare/execute snippet:

           my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("exec my_proc \@p1 = ?");
           $sth-&gt;bind_param(1, 3.456, SQL_NUMERIC);

       This generates the following error:

       DBD::Sybase::st execute failed: Server message number=241 severity=16  state=2  line=0  procedure=dbitest
       text=Scale error during implicit conversion of NUMERIC value '3.456' to a NUMERIC field.

       You can tell Sybase (and DBD::Sybase) to ignore these sorts of errors by setting the <u>arithabort</u> option:

           $dbh-&gt;do("set arithabort off");

       See the <u>set</u> command in the Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise Reference Manual for more information on the
       set command and on the arithabort option.

</pre><h4><b>Other</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
   <b>DBD::Sybase</b> <b>private</b> <b>Database</b> <b>Handle</b> <b>Methods</b>
       $bool = $dbh-&gt;syb_isdead
           Tests the connection to see if the connection has been marked DEAD by OpenClient.  The connection can
           get marked DEAD if an error occurs on the connection, or the connection fails.

   <b>DBD::Sybase</b> <b>private</b> <b>Statement</b> <b>Handle</b> <b>Methods</b>
       @data = $sth-&gt;syb_describe([$assoc])
           Retrieves  the  description  of each of the output columns of the current result set. Each element of
           the returned array is a reference to a hash that describes the column. The following fields are  set:
           NAME, TYPE, SYBTYPE, MAXLENGTH, SCALE, PRECISION, STATUS.

           You could use it like this:

              my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("select name, uid from sysusers");
              $sth-&gt;execute;
              my @description = $sth-&gt;syb_describe;
              print "$description[0]-&gt;{NAME}\n";         # prints name
              print "$description[0]-&gt;{MAXLENGTH}\n";    # prints 30
              ....

              while(my $row = $sth-&gt;fetch) {
                 ....
              }

           The  STATUS  field is a string which can be tested for the following values: CS_CANBENULL, CS_HIDDEN,
           CS_IDENTITY, CS_KEY, CS_VERSION_KEY, CS_TIMESTAMP and CS_UPDATABLE. See table 3-46 of the Open Client
           Client Library Reference Manual for a description of each of these values.

           The TYPE field is the data type that Sybase::CTlib converts the column to when retrieving  the  data,
           so a DATETIME column will be returned as a CS_CHAR_TYPE column.

           The SYBTYPE field is the real Sybase data type for this column.

           <u>Note</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>symbolic</u> <u>values</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>CS_xxx</u> <u>symbols</u> <u>isn't</u> <u>available</u> <u>yet</u> <u>in</u> <u>DBD::Sybase.</u>

</pre><h4><b>Experimental</b> <b>Bulk-Load</b> <b>Functionality</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NOTE</b>:  This feature requires that the <u>libblk.a</u> library be available at build time. This is not always the
       case if the Sybase SDK isn't installed. You can test the $dbh-&gt;{syb_has_blk} attribute to see if the  BLK
       api calls are available in your copy of DBD::Sybase.

       Starting  with  release  1.04.2  DBD::Sybase  has  the  ability to use Sybase's BLK (bulk-loading) API to
       perform fast data loads. Basic usage is as follows:

         my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:Sybase:server=MY_SERVER;bulkLogin=1', $user, $pwd);

         $dbh-&gt;begin_work;  # optional.
         my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("insert the_table values(?, ?, ?, ?, ?)",
                                 {syb_bcp_attribs =&gt; { identity_flag =&gt; 0,
                                                      identity_column =&gt; 0 }}});
         while(&lt;DATA&gt;) {
           chomp;
           my @row = split(/\|/, $_);   # assume a pipe-delimited file...
           $sth-&gt;execute(@row);
         }
         $dbh-&gt;commit;
         print "Sent ", $sth-&gt;rows, " to the server\n";
         $sth-&gt;finish;

       First, you need to specify the new <u>bulkLogin</u> attribute in the  connection  string,  which  turns  on  the
       CS_BULK_LOGIN property for the connection. Without this property the BLK api will not be functional.

       You  call  $dbh-&gt;<b>prepare()</b>  with  a regular INSERT statement and the special <u>syb_bcp_attribs</u> attribute to
       turn on BLK handling of the data.  The <u>identity_flag</u> sub-attribute can be set to 1 if  your  source  data
       includes  the  values  for the target table's IDENTITY column. If the target table has an IDENTITY column
       but you want the insert operation to generate a new value for each row then leave <u>identity_flag</u> at 0, but
       set <u>identity_col</u> to the column number of the identity column (it's usually the first column in the table,
       but not always.)

       The number of placeholders in the INSERT statement <u>must</u> correspond to the number of columns in the table,
       and the input data <u>must</u> be in the same order as the table's physical column order. Any column list in the
       INSERT statement (i.e. <u>insert</u> <u>table(a,</u> <u>b,</u> <u>c,...)</u> <u>values(...)</u> is ignored.

       The value of AutoCommit  is  ignored  for  BLK  operations  -  rows  are  only  commited  when  you  call
       $dbh-&gt;commit.

       You  can  call  $dbh-&gt;rollback  to  cancel any uncommited rows, but this <u>also</u> cancels the rest of the BLK
       operation: any attempt to load rows to the server after a call to $dbh-&gt;<b>rollback()</b> will fail.

       If a row fails to load due to a CLIENT side error (such as a data conversion error) then  $sth-&gt;<b>execute()</b>
       will return a failure (i.e. false) and $sth-&gt;errstr will have the reason for the error.

       If  a row fails on the SERVER side (for example due to a duplicate row error) then the entire batch (i.e.
       between two $dbh-&gt;<b>commit()</b> calls) will fail. This is normal behavior for BLK/bcp.

       The Bulk-Load API is very sensitive to data conversion issues, as all the conversions are handled on  the
       client side, and the row is pre-formatted before being sent to the server. By default any conversion that
       is flagged by Sybase's <b>cs_convert()</b> call will result in a failed row. Some of these conversion errors are
       patently  fatal  (e.g. converting 'Feb 30 2001' to a DATETIME value...), while others are debatable (e.g.
       converting 123.456 to a NUMERIC(6,2) which results in a loss  of  precision).  The  default  behavior  of
       failing  any  row  that  has  a  conversion error in it can be modified by using a special error handler.
       Returning 0 from this handler tells DBD::Sybase to fail this row, and returning 1  means  that  we  still
       want  to  try  to  send the row to the server (obviously Sybase's internal code can still fail the row at
       that point.)  You set the handler like this:

           DBD::Sybase::syb_set_cslib_cb(\&amp;handler);

       and a sample handler:

          sub cslib_handler {
            my ($layer, $origin, $severity, $errno, $errmsg, $osmsg, $blkmsg) = @_;

            print "Layer: $layer, Origin: $origin, Severity: $severity, Error: $errno\n";
            print $msg;
            print $osmsg if($osmsg);
            print $blkmsg if $blkmsg;

            return 1 if($errno == 36)

            return 0;
          }

       Please see the t/xblk.t test script for some examples.

       Reminder - this is an <u>experimental</u> implementation. It may change in the future, and it could be buggy.

</pre><h4><b>Using</b> <b>DBD::Sybase</b> <b>with</b> <b>MS-SQL</b></h4><pre>
       MS-SQL started out as Sybase 4.2, and there are still a lot of similarities  between  Sybase  and  MS-SQL
       which  makes  it  possible  to  use  DBD::Sybase  to  query  a  MS-SQL dataserver using either the Sybase
       OpenClient libraries or the FreeTDS libraries (see <a href="http://www.freetds.org">http://www.freetds.org</a>).

       However, using the Sybase libraries to query an MS-SQL server  has  certain  limitations.  In  particular
       ?-style  placeholders are not supported (although support when using the FreeTDS libraries is possible in
       a future release of the libraries), and certain <b>syb_</b> attributes may not be supported.

       Sybase defaults the TEXTSIZE attribute (aka <b>LongReadLen</b>) to 32k, but MS-SQL 7 doesn't  seem  to  do  that
       correctly, resulting in very large memory requests when querying tables with TEXT/IMAGE data columns. The
       work-around  is  to  set TEXTSIZE to some decent value via $dbh-&gt;{LongReadLen} (if that works - I haven't
       had any confirmation that it does) or via $dbh-&gt;do("set textsize &lt;somesize&gt;");

</pre><h4><b>nsql</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>nsql()</b> call is a direct port of the function of the same name that exists in Sybase::DBlib. From 1.08
       it has been extended to offer new functionality.

       Usage:

          @data = $dbh-&gt;func($sql, $type, $callback, $options, 'nsql');

       If the DBI version is 1.37 or later, then you can also call it this way:

          @data = $dbh-&gt;syb_nsql($sql, $type, $callback, $options);

       This executes the query in $sql, and returns all the data in @data. The $type parameter can  be  used  to
       specify  that  each returned row be in array form (i.e. $type passed as 'ARRAY', which is the default) or
       in hash form ($type passed as 'HASH') with column names as keys.

       If $callback is specified it is taken as a reference to a perl sub, and each row returned by the query is
       passed to this subroutine <u>instead</u> of being returned by the routine (to allow processing of  large  result
       sets, for example).

       If $options is specified and is a HASH ref, the following keys affect the value returned by <b>nsql()</b>:

       oktypes =&gt; [...]
           This  generalises  <u>syb_nsql_nostatus</u>  (see below) by ignoring any result sets which are of a type not
           listed.

       bytype =&gt; 0|1|'merge'
           If this option is set to a true value, each result set will be returned as the value of a  hash,  the
           key  of  which  is  the  result  type of this result set as defined by the CS_*_TYPE values described
           above. If the special value 'merge' is used, result sets of the  same  type  will  be  catenated  (as
           <b>nsql()</b>  does  by  default) into a single array of results and the result of the <b>nsql()</b> call will be a
           single hash keyed by result type. Usage is better written %data = $dbh-&gt;syb_nsql(...) in this case.

       arglist =&gt; [...]
           This option provides support for placeholders in the SQL query passed to <b>nsql()</b>.  Each time  the  SQL
           statement  is  executed  the  array  value of this option will be passed as the parameter list to the
           <b>execute()</b> method.

       Note that if $callback is omitted, a hash reference in that parameter position will be interpreted as  an
       option hash if no hash reference is found in the $options parameter position.

       "nsql" also checks three special attributes to enable deadlock retry logic (<u>Note</u> none of these attributes
       have any effect anywhere else at the moment):

       syb_deadlock_retry <u>count</u>
           Set  this  to a non-0 value to enable deadlock detection and retry logic within <b>nsql()</b>. If a deadlock
           error is detected (error code 1205) then the entire batch is re-submitted  up  to  <u>syb_deadlock_retry</u>
           times. Default is 0 (off).

       syb_deadlock_sleep <u>seconds</u>
           Number of seconds to sleep between deadlock retries. Default is 60.

       syb_deadlock_verbose (bool)
           Enable verbose logging of deadlock retry logic. Default is off.

       syb_nsql_nostatus (bool)
           If  true  then  stored  procedure  return  status  values (i.e. results of type CS_STATUS_RESULT) are
           ignored.

       Deadlock detection will be added to the $dbh-&gt;<b>do()</b> method in a future version of DBD::Sybase.

</pre><h4><b>Multi-Threading</b></h4><pre>
       DBD::Sybase is thread-safe (i.e. can be used in a multi-threaded perl application  where  more  than  one
       thread accesses the database server) with the following restrictions:

       •   perl version &gt;= 5.8

           DBD::Sybase  requires the use of <u>ithreads</u>, available in the perl 5.8.0 release. It will not work with
           the older 5.005 threading model.

       •   Sybase thread-safe libraries

           Sybase's Client Library comes in two flavors. DBD::Sybase must find the thread-safe  version  of  the
           libraries  (ending  in  _r on Unix/linux). This means Open Client 11.1.1 or later. In particular this
           means that you can't use the 10.0.4 libraries from the free 11.0.3.3 release on linux if you want  to
           use multi-threading.

           Note: when using perl &gt;= 5.8 with the thread-safe libraries (libct_r.so, etc) then signal handling is
           broken  and  any  signal  delivered  to  the  perl process will result in a segmentation fault. It is
           recommended in that case to link with the non-threadsafe libraries.

       •   use DBD::Sybase

           You <u>must</u> include the "use DBD::Sybase;" line in your program.  This  is  needed  because  DBD::Sybase
           needs to do some setup <u>before</u> the first thread is started.

       You   can  check  to  see  if  your  version  of  DBD::Sybase  is  thread-safe  at  run-time  by  calling
       <b>DBD::Sybase::thread_enabled()</b>. This will return <u>true</u> if multi-threading is available.

       See t/thread.t for a simple example.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       You can run out of space in the tempdb database if you use a lot of calls with bind variables (ie ?-style
       placeholders) without closing the connection and Sybase 11.5.x or older. This is because  Sybase  creates
       stored  procedures for each <b>prepare()</b> call.  In 11.9.x and later Sybase will create "light-weight" stored
       procedures which don't use up any space in the tempdb database.

       The <b>primary_key_info()</b> method will only  return  data  for  tables  where  a  declarative  "primary  key"
       constraint was included when the table was created.

       I  have  a  simple bug tracking database at <a href="http://www.peppler.org/bugdb/">http://www.peppler.org/bugdb/</a> .  You can use it to view known
       problems, or to report new ones.
