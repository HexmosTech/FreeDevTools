</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Geo::Converter::WKT2KML - Simple converter between WKT and KML

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Geo::Converter::WKT2KML;

           # Convert WKT to KML's geometry fragment
           wkt2kml('POINT(135 35)');

           # Convert KML's geometry fragment to KML
           kml2wkt('&lt;Point&gt;&lt;coordinates&gt;135,35&lt;/coordinates&gt;&lt;/Point&gt;');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
           This module provides two functions, wkt2kml and kml2wkt.
           These are convert geometry formats WKT (Well-Known Text) and KML
           each other.

           This module can interpret only geometry fragment of KML, cannot
           interpret full spec KML.
           Only elements can be understood are:

            * Point
            * LineString
            * Polygon
            * MultiGeometry
            * (Belows are child elements of aboves)
            * coordinates
            * LinearRing
            * outerBoundaryIs
            * innerBoundaryIs

           WKT is also understood full spec one.
           "POINT ZM ..." or "POLYGON EMPTY" are cannot interpreted.
           Only commands can be understood are:

            * POINT
            * MULTIPOINT
            * LINESTRING
            * MULTILINESTRING
            * POLYGON
            * MULTIPOLYGON
            * GEOMETRYCOLLECTION

</pre><h4><b>EXPORT</b></h4><pre>
       wkt2kml($wkt)
           Returns KML geometry fragment.

       kml2wkt($kml_fragment)
           Returns WKT.
