</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Moose::Manual::Support - Policies regarding support, releases, and compatibility.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.2207

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b> <b>POLICY</b></h4><pre>
       There are two principles to Moose's policy of supported behavior.

       1.  Moose favors correctness over everything.

       2.  Moose supports documented and tested behavior, not accidental behavior or side effects.

       If  a  behavior  has  never been documented or tested, the behavior is <u>officially</u> undefined. Relying upon
       undocumented and untested behavior is done at your own risk.

       If a behavior is documented or tested but found to be incorrect later, the behavior  will  go  through  a
       deprecation  period. During the deprecation period, use of that feature will cause a warning. Eventually,
       the deprecated feature will be removed.

       In some cases, it is not possible to deprecate a behavior. In this case,  the  behavior  will  simply  be
       changed in a major release.

</pre><h4><b>RELEASE</b> <b>SCHEDULE</b></h4><pre>
       Moose is on a system of quarterly major releases, with minor releases as needed between major releases. A
       minor  release  is defined as one that makes every attempt to preserve backwards compatibility. Currently
       this means that we did not introduce any new dependency conflicts, and that we did not make  any  changes
       to  documented  or tested behavior (this typically means that minor releases will not change any existing
       tests in the test suite, although they can add new ones). A minor release can include  new  features  and
       bug fixes.

       Major  releases may be backwards incompatible. Moose prioritizes correctness over backwards compatibility
       or performance; see  the  DEPRECATION  POLICY  to  understand  how  backwards  incompatible  changes  are
       announced.

       Major  releases are scheduled to happen during fixed release windows. If the window is missed, then there
       will not be a major release until the next release window. The release windows are one  month  long,  and
       occur during the months of January, April, July, and October.

       Before a major release, a series of development releases will be made so that users can test the upcoming
       major release before it is distributed to CPAN. It is in the best interests of everyone involved if these
       releases are tested as widely as possible.

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATION</b> <b>POLICY</b></h4><pre>
       Moose has always prioritized correctness over performance and backwards compatibility.

       Major  deprecations or API changes are documented in the Changes file as well as in Moose::Manual::Delta.
       The Moose developers will also make an effort to warn users of upcoming deprecations and breakage through
       the Moose blog (<a href="http://blog.moose.perl.org">http://blog.moose.perl.org</a>).

       Deprecated APIs will be preserved for at least one year <u>after</u> <u>the</u> <u>major</u>  <u>release</u>  <u>which</u>  <u>deprecates</u>  <u>that</u>
       <u>API</u>. Deprecated APIs will only be removed in a major release.

       Moose  will also warn during installation if the version of Moose being installed will break an installed
       dependency. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Perl install process these warnings may  be  easy  to
       miss.

</pre><h4><b>BACKWARDS</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       We try to ensure compatibility by having a extensive test suite (last count over 18000 tests), as well as
       testing a number of packages (currently just under 100 packages) that depend on Moose before any release.

       The current list of downstream dependencies that are tested is in "xt/author/test-my-dependents.t".

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>NUMBERS</b></h4><pre>
       Moose  version  numbers  consist  of three parts, in the form X.YYZZ. The X is the "special magic number"
       that only gets changed for really big changes. Think of this as being like the "5" in Perl 5.12.1.

       The YY portion is the major version number. Moose uses even numbers for stable releases, and odd  numbers
       for trial releases. The ZZ is the minor version, and it simply increases monotonically. It starts at "00"
       each time a new major version is released.

       Semantically,  this means that any two releases which share a major version should be API-compatible with
       each other. In other words, 2.0200, 2.0201, and 2.0274 are all API-compatible.

       Prior to version 2.0, Moose version numbers were monotonically incrementing  two  decimal  values  (0.01,
       0.02, ... 1.11, 1.12, etc.).

       Moose was declared production ready at version 0.18 (via &lt;<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/">http://www.perlmonks.org/</a>?node_id=608144&gt;).

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       As  of  version  2.16,  Moose will officially support being run on perl 5.10.1+. Our current policy is to
       support the earliest version of Perl shipped in the latest stable release of any major  operating  system
       (this  tends  to  mean  CentOS).  We will provide at least six months notice (two major releases) when we
       decide to increase the officially supported Perl version.

       "Officially supported" does not mean that these are the only versions of Perl that Moose will work  with.
       Our  declared  perl dependency will remain at 5.8.3 as long as our test suite continues to pass on 5.8.3.
       What this does mean is that the core Moose dev team will not be spending any time fixing bugs on versions
       that aren't officially supported, and new contributions will not be rejected due  to  being  incompatible
       with  older versions of perl except in the most trivial of cases. We will, however, still welcome patches
       to make Moose compatible with earlier versions, if other  people  are  still  interested  in  maintaining
       compatibility.  As  such,  the  current  minimum  required  version  of  5.8.3 will remain for as long as
       downstream users are happy to assist with maintenance.

       Note that although performance regressions are acceptable in order to  maintain  backwards  compatibility
       (as  long  as they only affect the older versions), functionality changes and buggy behavior will not be.
       If it becomes impossible to provide identical functionality between modern Perl versions and  unsupported
       Perl versions, we will increase our declared perl dependency instead.

</pre><h4><b>CONTRIBUTING</b></h4><pre>
       Moose   has   an   open   contribution  policy.  Anybody  is  welcome  to  submit  a  patch.  Please  see
       Moose::Manual::Contributing for more details.
