</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Inline-Support - Support Information for Inline.pm and related modules.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document contains all of the latest support information for "Inline.pm" and the recognized Inline
       Language Support Modules (ILSMs) available on CPAN.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>LANGUAGES</b></h4><pre>
       The most important language that Inline supports is "C". That is because Perl itself is written in "C".
       By giving a your Perl scripts access to "C", you in effect give them access to the entire glorious
       internals of Perl. (Caveat scriptor :-)

       As of this writing, Inline also supports:

       •   C++

       •   Java

       •   Python

       •   Tcl

       •   Assembly

       •   CPR

       •   And even Inline::Foo! :)

       Projects that I would most like to see happen in the year 2001 are:

       •   Fortran

       •   Ruby

       •   Lisp

       •   Guile

       •   Bash

       •   Perl4

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>PLATFORMS</b></h4><pre>
       "Inline::C"  should work anywhere that CPAN extension modules (those that use XS) can be installed, using
       the typical install format of:

           perl Makefile.PL
           make
           make test
           make install

       It has been tested on many Unix and Windows variants.

       <b>NOTE</b>: "Inline::C" requires Perl 5.005 or higher because "Parse::RecDescent" requires it. (Something to do
       with the "qr" operator)

       Inline has been successfully tested at one time or another on the following platforms:

       •   Linux

       •   Solaris

       •   SunOS

       •   HPUX

       •   AIX

       •   FreeBSD

       •   OpenBSD

       •   BeOS

       •   OS X

       •   WinNT

       •   Win2K

       •   WinME

       •   Win98

       •   Cygwin

       The Microsoft tests deserve a little more explanation. I used the following:

       •   Windows NT 4.0 (service pack 6)

       •   Perl 5.005_03 (ActiveState build 522)

       •   MS Visual C++ 6.0

       •   The "nmake" make utility (distributed w/ Visual C++)

       "Inline::C" pulls all of its base configuration (including which "make" utility to use) from "Config.pm".
       Since your MSWin32 version of Perl  probably  came  from  ActiveState  (as  a  binary  distribution)  the
       "Config.pm"  will  indicate that "nmake" is the system's "make" utility. That is because ActiveState uses
       Visual C++ to compile Perl.

       To install "Inline.pm" (or any other CPAN module) on MSWin32 w/ Visual C++, use these:

           perl Makefile.PL
           nmake
           nmake test
           nmake install

       Inline has also been made to work with Mingw32/gcc on all Windows platforms.  This is a free compiler for
       Windows. You must also use a perl built with that compiler.

       The "Cygwin" test was done on a Windows 98 machine using the Cygwin  Unix/Win32  porting  layer  software
       from  Cygnus. The "perl" binary on this machine was also compiled using the Cygwin tool set ("gcc"). This
       software is freely available from &lt;<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/</a>&gt;

       If you get Inline to work on a new platform, please send me email email. If it doesn't work, let me  know
       as well and I'll see what can be done.
