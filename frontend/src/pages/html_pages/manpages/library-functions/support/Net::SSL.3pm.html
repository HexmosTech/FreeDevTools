</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::SSL - support for Secure Sockets Layer

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new Creates a new "Net::SSL" object.

       configure
           Configures a "Net::SSL" socket for operation.

       configure_certs
           Sets up a certificate file to use for communicating with on the socket.

       connect
       die_with_error
       get_cipher
       get_lwp_object
           Walks  up  the  caller  stack and looks for something blessed into the "LWP::UserAgent" namespace and
           returns it. Vaguely deprecated.

       get_peer_certificate
           Gets the peer certificate from the underlying "Crypt::SSLeay::Conn" object.

       get_peer_verify
       get_shared_ciphers
       getchunk
           Attempts to read up to 32KiB of data from the socket. Returns "undef" if nothing was read,  otherwise
           returns the data as a scalar.

       pending
           Provides access to OpenSSL's "pending" attribute on the SSL connection object.

       getline
           Reads  one  character  at  a time until a newline is encountered, and returns the line, including the
           newline. Grossly inefficient.

       print
           Concatenates the input parameters and writes them to the socket.  Does not honour $, nor $<a href="file:/.">/.</a>  Returns
           the number of bytes written.

       printf
           Performs  a  "sprintf"  of  the  input parameters (thus, the first parameter must be the format), and
           writes the result to the socket.  Returns the number of bytes written.

       proxy
           Returns the hostname of an  https  proxy  server,  as  specified  by  the  "HTTPS_PROXY"  environment
           variable.

       proxy_connect_helper
           Helps set up a connection through a proxy.

       read
           Performs a read on the socket and returns the result.

       ssl_context
       sysread
           Is an alias of "read".

       timeout
           Returns  the  timeout  value  of  the  socket  as  defined by the implementing class or 60 seconds by
           default.

       blocking
           Returns a boolean indicating whether the underlying socket is in blocking mode. By default,  Net::SSL
           sockets are in blocking mode.

               $sock-&gt;<a href="../man0/blocking.0.html">blocking</a>(0); # set to non-blocking mode

           This method simply calls the underlying "blocking" method of the IO::Socket object.

       write
           Writes the parameters passed in (thus, a list) to the socket. Returns the number of bytes written.

       syswrite
           Is an alias of "write".

       accept
           Not yet implemented. Will die if called.

       getc
           Not yet implemented. Will die if called.

       getlines
           Not yet implemented. Will die if called.

       ungetc
           Not yet implemented. Will die if called.

       send_useragent_to_proxy
           By  default  (as  of  version 2.80 of "Net::SSL" in the 0.54 distribution of Crypt::SSLeay), the user
           agent string is no longer sent to the proxy (but will continue to be sent to the remote host).

           The previous behaviour was of marginal benefit, and could cause fatal  errors  in  certain  scenarios
           (see CPAN bug #4759) and so no longer happens by default.

           To  reinstate  the old behaviour, call "Net::SSL::send_useragent_to_proxy" with a true value (usually
           1).

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
         "no port given for proxy server &lt;proxy&gt;"

       A proxy was specified for configuring a socket, but no port number was given. Ensure that  the  proxy  is
       specified as a host:port pair, such as "proxy.example.com:8086".

         "configure certs failed: &lt;contents of $@&gt;; &lt;contents of $!&gt;"

         "proxy connect failed: &lt;contents of $@&gt;; &lt;contents of $!&gt;"

         "Connect failed: &lt;contents of $@&gt;; &lt;contents of $!&gt;"

       During <b>connect()</b>.

   <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b>
       IO::Socket::INET
           "Net::SSL"   is  implemented  by  subclassing  "IO::Socket::INET",  hence  methods  not  specifically
           overridden are defined by that package.

       Net::SSLeay
           A package that provides a Perl-level interface to the "openssl" secure sockets layer library.
