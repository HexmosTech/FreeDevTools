</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DBI::Gofer::Execute - Executes Gofer requests and returns Gofer responses

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         $executor = DBI::Gofer::Execute-&gt;new( { ...config... });

         $response = $executor-&gt;execute_request( $request );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Accepts a DBI::Gofer::Request object, executes the requested DBI method calls, and returns a
       DBI::Gofer::Response object.

       Any error, including any internal 'fatal' errors are caught and converted into a DBI::Gofer::Response
       object.

       This module is usually invoked by a 'server-side' Gofer transport module.  They usually have names in the
       ""DBI::Gofer::Transport::*"" namespace.  Examples include: DBI::Gofer::Transport::stream and
       DBI::Gofer::Transport::mod_perl.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>check_request_sub</b>
       If defined, it must be a reference to a subroutine that will 'check' the request.  It is passed the
       request object and the executor as its only arguments.

       The subroutine can either return the original request object or die with a suitable error message (which
       will be turned into a Gofer response).

       It can also construct and return a new request that should be executed instead of the original request.

   <b>check_response_sub</b>
       If defined, it must be a reference to a subroutine that will 'check' the response.  It is passed the
       response object, the executor, and the request object.  The sub may alter the response object and return
       undef, or return a new response object.

       This mechanism can be used to, for example, terminate the service if specific database errors are seen.

   <b>forced_connect_dsn</b>
       If set, this DSN is always used instead of the one in the request.

   <b>default_connect_dsn</b>
       If set, this DSN is used if "forced_connect_dsn" is not set and the request does not contain a DSN
       itself.

   <b>forced_connect_attributes</b>
       A reference to a hash of <b>connect()</b> attributes. Individual attributes in "forced_connect_attributes" will
       take precedence over corresponding attributes in the request.

   <b>default_connect_attributes</b>
       A reference to a hash of <b>connect()</b> attributes. Individual attributes in the request take precedence over
       corresponding attributes in "default_connect_attributes".

   <b>max_cached_dbh_per_drh</b>
       If set, the loaded drivers will be checked to ensure they don't have more than this number of cached
       connections. There is no default value. This limit is not enforced for every request.

   <b>max_cached_sth_per_dbh</b>
       If set, all the cached statement handles will be cleared once the number of cached statement handles
       rises above this limit. The default is 1000.

   <b>forced_single_resultset</b>
       If true, then only the first result set will be fetched and returned in the response.

   <b>forced_response_attributes</b>
       A reference to a data structure that can specify extra attributes to be returned in responses.

         forced_response_attributes =&gt; {
             DriverName =&gt; {
                 dbh =&gt; [ qw(dbh_attrib_name) ],
                 sth =&gt; [ qw(sth_attrib_name) ],
             },
         },

       This can be useful in cases where the driver has not implemented the <b>private_attribute_info()</b> method and
       DBI::Gofer::Execute's own fallback list of private attributes doesn't include the driver or attributes
       you need.

   <b>track_recent</b>
       If set, specifies the number of recent requests and responses that should be kept by the <b>update_stats()</b>
       method for diagnostics. See DBI::Gofer::Transport::mod_perl.

       Note that this setting can significantly increase memory use. Use with caution.

   <b>forced_gofer_random</b>
       Enable forced random failures and/or delays for testing. See "DBI_GOFER_RANDOM" below.

</pre><h4><b>DRIVER-SPECIFIC</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       Gofer needs to know about any driver-private attributes that should have their values sent back to the
       client.

       If the driver doesn't support <b>private_attribute_info()</b> method, and very few do, then the module falls
       back to using some hard-coded details, if available, for the driver being used. Currently hard-coded
       details are available for the mysql, Pg, Sybase, and SQLite drivers.

</pre><h4><b>TESTING</b></h4><pre>
       DBD::Gofer, DBD::Execute and related packages are well tested by executing the DBI test suite with
       DBI_AUTOPROXY configured to route all DBI calls via DBD::Gofer.

       Because Gofer includes timeout and 'retry on error' mechanisms there is a need for some way to trigger
       delays and/or errors. This can be done via the "forced_gofer_random" configuration item, or else the
       DBI_GOFER_RANDOM environment variable.

   <b>DBI_GOFER_RANDOM</b>
       The value of the "forced_gofer_random" configuration item (or else the DBI_GOFER_RANDOM environment
       variable) is treated as a series of tokens separated by commas.

       The tokens can be one of three types:

       fail=R%
           Set  the current failure rate to R where R is a percentage.  The value R can be floating point, e.g.,
           "fail=0.05%".  Negative values for R have special meaning, see below.

       err=N
           Sets the current failure err value to N (instead  of  the  DBI's  default  'standard  err  value'  of
           2000000000). This is useful when you want to simulate a specific error.

       delayN=R%
           Set the current random delay rate to R where R is a percentage, and set the current delay duration to
           N seconds. The values of R and N can be floating point, e.g., "delay0.5=0.2%".  Negative values for R
           have special meaning, see below.

           If R is an odd number (R % 2 == 1) then a message is logged via <b>warn()</b> which will be returned to, and
           echoed at, the client.

       methodname
           Applies  the  current  fail,  err, and delay values to the named method.  If neither a fail nor delay
           have been set yet then a warning is generated.

       For example:

         $executor = DBI::Gofer::Execute-&gt;new( {
           forced_gofer_random =&gt; "fail=0.01%,do,delay60=1%,execute",
         });

       will cause the <b>do()</b> method to fail for 0.01% of calls, and the <b>execute()</b> method to fail  0.01%  of  calls
       and be delayed by 60 seconds on 1% of calls.

       If  the percentage value ("R") is negative then instead of the failures being triggered randomly (via the
       <b>rand()</b> function) they are triggered via a sequence number. In other words ""fail=-20%"" will  mean  every
       fifth call will fail.  Each method has a distinct sequence number.
