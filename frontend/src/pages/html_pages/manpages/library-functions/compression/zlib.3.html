</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       zlib - compression/decompression library

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       [see <u>zlib.h</u> for full description]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>zlib</u>  library is a general purpose data compression library.  The code is thread safe, assuming that
       the standard library functions used are thread safe, such as memory allocation routines.  It provides in-
       memory compression and decompression functions, including integrity  checks  of  the  uncompressed  data.
       This  version of the library supports only one compression method (deflation) but other algorithms may be
       added later with the same stream interface.

       Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large enough or can be done by repeated calls
       of the compression function.  In the latter case, the application must provide more input and/or  consume
       the output (providing more output space) before each call.

       The  library also supports reading and writing files in <u><a href="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</a></u>(1) (.gz) format with an interface similar to
       that of stdio.

       The library does not install any signal handler.  The decoder checks the consistency  of  the  compressed
       data, so the library should never crash even in the case of corrupted input.

       All  functions  of  the  compression  library are documented in the file <u>zlib.h</u>.  The distribution source
       includes examples of use of the library in the files <u>test/example.c</u> and <u>test/minigzip.c,</u> as well as other
       examples in the <u>examples/</u> directory.

       Changes to this version are documented in the file <u>ChangeLog</u> that accompanies the source.

       <u>zlib</u> is built in to many languages and operating systems, including but  not  limited  to  Java,  Python,
       .NET, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Swift, and Go.

       An  experimental  package  to  read  and write files in the .zip format, written on top of <u>zlib</u> by Gilles
       Vollant (<a href="mailto:info@winimage.com">info@winimage.com</a>), is available at:

              <a href="http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html">http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html</a> and also in the <u>contrib/minizip</u> directory of the main
              <u>zlib</u> source distribution.

       The data format used by the <u>zlib</u> library is described by RFC (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952  in  the
       files:

              <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950</a> (for the zlib header and trailer format)
              <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951</a> (for the deflate compressed data format)
              <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1952">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1952</a> (for the gzip header and trailer format)

       Mark  Nelson  wrote  an  article about <u>zlib</u> for the Jan. 1997 issue of  Dr. Dobb's Journal; a copy of the
       article is available at:

</pre><h4><b>REPORTING</b> <b>PROBLEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Before reporting a problem, please check the <u>zlib</u> web site to verify that you have the latest version  of
       <u>zlib</u>; otherwise, obtain the latest version and see if the problem still exists.  Please read the <u>zlib</u> FAQ
       at:

       before  asking  for  help.   Send  questions  and/or  comments  to <a href="mailto:zlib@gzip.org">zlib@gzip.org</a>, or (for the Windows DLL
       version) to Gilles Vollant (<a href="mailto:info@winimage.com">info@winimage.com</a>).
