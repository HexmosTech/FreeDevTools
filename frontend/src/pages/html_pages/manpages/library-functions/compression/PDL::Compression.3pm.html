       PDL::Compression - compression utilities

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These routines generally accept some data as a PDL and compress it into a smaller PDL.  Algorithms
       typically work on a single dimension and thread over other dimensions, producing a threaded table of
       compressed values if more than one dimension is fed in.

       The Rice algorithm, in particular, is designed to be identical to the RICE_1 algorithm used in internal
       FITS-file compression (see PDL::IO::FITS).

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use PDL::Compression

        ($y,$xsize) = $x-&gt;rice_compress();
        $c = $y-&gt;rice_expand($xsize);

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>rice_compress</b>
         Signature: (in(n); [o]<a href="../manm/out.m.html">out</a>(m); int[o]len(); int blocksize)

       Squishes an input PDL along the 0 dimension by Rice compression.  In scalar context, you get back only
       the compressed PDL; in list context, you also get back ancillary information that is required to
       uncompress the data with rice_uncompress.

       Multidimensional data are threaded over - each row is compressed separately, and the returned PDL is
       squished to the maximum compressed size of any row.  If any of the streams could not be compressed (the
       algorithm produced longer output), the corresponding length is set to -1 and the row is treated as if it
       had length 0.

       Rice compression only works on integer data types -- if you have floating point data you must first
       quantize them.

       The underlying algorithm is identical to the Rice compressor used in CFITSIO (and is used by
       PDL::IO::FITS to load and save compressed FITS images).

       The optional blocksize indicates how many samples are to be compressed as a unit; it defaults to 32.

       How it works:

       Rice compression is a subset of Golomb compression, and works on data sets where variation between
       adjacent samples is typically small compared to the dynamic range of each sample.  In this implementation
       (originally written by Richard White and contributed to CFITSIO in 1999), the data are divided into
       blocks of samples (by default 32 samples per block).  Each block has a running difference applied, and
       the difference is bit-folded to make it positive definite.  High order bits of the difference stream are
       discarded, and replaced with a unary representation; low order bits are preserved.  Unary representation
       is very efficient for small numbers, but large jumps could give rise to ludicrously large bins in a plain
       Golomb code; such large jumps ("high entropy" samples) are simply recorded directly in the output stream.

       Working on astronomical or solar image data, typical compression ratios of 2-3 are achieved.

         $out = $pdl-&gt;rice_compress($blocksize);
         ($out, $len, $blocksize, $dim0) = $pdl-&gt;rice_compress;

         $new = $out-&gt;rice_expand;

       rice_compress ignores the bad-value flag of the input ndarrays.  It will set the bad-value flag of all
       output ndarrays if the flag is set for any of the input ndarrays.

   <b>rice_expand</b>
         Signature: (in(n); [o]<a href="../manm/out.m.html">out</a>(m); int blocksize)

       Unsquishes a PDL that has been squished by rice_compress.

            ($out, $len, $blocksize, $dim0) = $pdl-&gt;rice_compress;
            $copy = $out-&gt;rice_expand($dim0, $blocksize);

       rice_expand ignores the bad-value flag of the input ndarrays.  It will set the bad-value flag of all
       output ndarrays if the flag is set for any of the input ndarrays.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       •  Currently headers are ignored.

       •  Currently there is only one compression algorithm.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       •  Add object encapsulation

       •  Add test suite
