</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       toplevel surface

       This interface defines an xdg_surface role which allows a surface to, among other things, set window-like
       properties such as maximize, fullscreen, and minimize, set application-specific metadata like title and
       id, and well as trigger user interactive operations such as interactive resize and move.

       Unmapping an xdg_toplevel means that the surface cannot be shown by the compositor until it is explicitly
       mapped again. All active operations (e.g., move, resize) are canceled and all attributes (e.g. title,
       state, stacking, ...) are discarded for an xdg_toplevel surface when it is unmapped. The xdg_toplevel
       returns to the state it had right after xdg_surface.get_toplevel. The client can re-map the toplevel by
       perfoming a commit without any buffer attached, waiting for a configure event and handling it as usual
       (see xdg_surface description).

       Attaching a null buffer to a toplevel unmaps the surface.

   <b>void</b> <b>xdg_toplevel_t::close</b> <b>(bool</b> <b>post</b> <b>=</b> <b>true)</b>
       surface wants to be closed The close event is sent by the compositor when the user wants the surface to
       be closed. This should be equivalent to the user clicking the close button in client-side decorations, if
       your application has any.

       This is only a request that the user intends to close the window. The client may choose to ignore this
       request, or show a dialog to ask the user to save their data, etc.

   <b>void</b> <b>xdg_toplevel_t::configure</b> <b>(int32_t</b> <b>width,</b> <b>int32_t</b> <b>height,</b> <b>array_t</b> <b>const</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>states,</b> <b>bool</b> <b>post</b> <b>=</b> <b>true)</b>
       suggest a surface change

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>width</u>
           <u>height</u>
           <u>states</u>

       This configure event asks the client to resize its toplevel surface or to change its state. The
       configured state should not be applied immediately. See xdg_surface.configure for details.

       The width and height arguments specify a hint to the window about how its surface should be resized in
       window geometry coordinates. See set_window_geometry.

       If the width or height arguments are zero, it means the client should decide its own window dimension.
       This may happen when the compositor needs to configure the state of the surface but doesn't have any
       information about any previous or expected dimension.

       The states listed in the event specify how the width/height arguments should be interpreted, and possibly
       how it should be drawn.

       Clients must send an ack_configure in response to this event. See xdg_surface.configure and
       xdg_surface.ack_configure for details.

       Definition at line <b>1336</b> of file <b>wayland-server-protocol-extra.cpp</b>.

   <b>void</b> <b>xdg_toplevel_t::configure_bounds</b> <b>(int32_t</b> <b>width,</b> <b>int32_t</b> <b>height,</b> <b>bool</b> <b>post</b> <b>=</b> <b>true)</b>
       recommended window geometry bounds

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>width</u>
           <u>height</u>

       The configure_bounds event may be sent prior to a xdg_toplevel.configure event to communicate the bounds
       a window geometry size is recommended to constrain to.

       The passed width and height are in surface coordinate space. If width and height are 0, it means bounds
       is unknown and equivalent to as if no configure_bounds event was ever sent for this surface.

       The bounds can for example correspond to the size of a monitor excluding any panels or other shell
       components, so that a surface isn't created in a way that it cannot fit.

       The bounds may change at any point, and in such a case, a new xdg_toplevel.configure_bounds will be sent,
       followed by xdg_toplevel.configure and xdg_surface.configure.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(seat_t,</b> <b>uint32_t)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>xdg_toplevel_t::on_move</b> <b>()</b>
       start an interactive move

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>seat</u> the wl_seat of the user event
           <u>serial</u> the serial of the user event

       Start an interactive, user-driven move of the surface.

       This request must be used in response to some sort of user action like a button press, key press, or
       touch down event. The passed serial is used to determine the type of interactive move (touch, pointer,
       etc).

       The server may ignore move requests depending on the state of the surface (e.g. fullscreen or maximized),
       or if the passed serial is no longer valid.

       If triggered, the surface will lose the focus of the device (wl_pointer, wl_touch, etc) used for the
       move. It is up to the compositor to visually indicate that the move is taking place, such as updating a
       pointer cursor, during the move. There is no guarantee that the device focus will return when the move is
       completed.

       start an interactive resize

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>seat</u> the wl_seat of the user event
           <u>serial</u> the serial of the user event
           <u>edges</u> which edge or corner is being dragged

       Start a user-driven, interactive resize of the surface.

       This request must be used in response to some sort of user action like a button press, key press, or
       touch down event. The passed serial is used to determine the type of interactive resize (touch, pointer,
       etc).

       The server may ignore resize requests depending on the state of the surface (e.g. fullscreen or
       maximized).

       If triggered, the client will receive configure events with the 'resize' state enum value and the
       expected sizes. See the 'resize' enum value for more details about what is required. The client must also
       acknowledge configure events using 'ack_configure'. After the resize is completed, the client will
       receive another 'configure' event without the resize state.

       If triggered, the surface also will lose the focus of the device (wl_pointer, wl_touch, etc) used for the
       resize. It is up to the compositor to visually indicate that the resize is taking place, such as updating
       a pointer cursor, during the resize. There is no guarantee that the device focus will return when the
       resize is completed.

       The edges parameter specifies how the surface should be resized, and is one of the values of the
       resize_edge enum. Values not matching a variant of the enum will cause a protocol error. The compositor
       may use this information to update the surface position for example when dragging the top left corner.
       The compositor may also use this information to adapt its behavior, e.g. choose an appropriate cursor
       image.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(std::string)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>xdg_toplevel_t::on_set_app_id</b> <b>()</b>
       set application ID

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>app_id</u>

       Set an application identifier for the surface.

       The app ID identifies the general class of applications to which the surface belongs. The compositor can
       use this to group multiple surfaces together, or to determine how to launch a new application.

       For D-Bus activatable applications, the app ID is used as the D-Bus service name.

       The compositor shell will try to group application surfaces together by their app ID. As a best practice,
       it is suggested to select app ID's that match the basename of the application's .desktop file. For
       example, 'org.freedesktop.FooViewer' where the .desktop file is 'org.freedesktop.FooViewer.desktop'.

       Like other properties, a set_app_id request can be sent after the xdg_toplevel has been mapped to update
       the property.

       See the desktop-entry specification [0] for more details on application identifiers and how they relate
       to well-known D-Bus names and .desktop files.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(output_t)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>xdg_toplevel_t::on_set_fullscreen</b> <b>()</b>
       set the window as fullscreen on an output

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>output</u>

       Make the surface fullscreen.

       After requesting that the surface should be fullscreened, the compositor will respond by emitting a
       configure event. Whether the client is actually put into a fullscreen state is subject to compositor
       policies. The client must also acknowledge the configure when committing the new content (see
       ack_configure).

       The output passed by the request indicates the client's preference as to which display it should be set
       fullscreen on. If this value is NULL, it's up to the compositor to choose which display will be used to
       map this surface.

       If the surface doesn't cover the whole output, the compositor will position the surface in the center of
       the output and compensate with with border fill covering the rest of the output. The content of the
       border fill is undefined, but should be assumed to be in some way that attempts to blend into the
       surrounding area (e.g. solid black).

       If the fullscreened surface is not opaque, the compositor must make sure that other screen content not
       part of the same surface tree (made up of subsurfaces, popups or similarly coupled surfaces) are not
       visible below the fullscreened surface.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(int32_t,</b> <b>int32_t)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>xdg_toplevel_t::on_set_max_size</b> <b>()</b>
       set the maximum size

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>width</u>
           <u>height</u>

       Set a maximum size for the window.

       The client can specify a maximum size so that the compositor does not try to configure the window beyond
       this size.

       The width and height arguments are in window geometry coordinates. See xdg_surface.set_window_geometry.

       Values set in this way are double-buffered. They will get applied on the next commit.

       The compositor can use this information to allow or disallow different states like maximize or fullscreen
       and draw accurate animations.

       Similarly, a tiling window manager may use this information to place and resize client windows in a more
       effective way.

       The client should not rely on the compositor to obey the maximum size. The compositor may decide to
       ignore the values set by the client and request a larger size.

       If never set, or a value of zero in the request, means that the client has no expected maximum size in
       the given dimension. As a result, a client wishing to reset the maximum size to an unspecified state can
       use zero for width and height in the request.

       Requesting a maximum size to be smaller than the minimum size of a surface is illegal and will result in
       a protocol error.

       The width and height must be greater than or equal to zero. Using strictly negative values for width and
       height will result in a protocol error.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void()&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>xdg_toplevel_t::on_set_maximized</b> <b>()</b>
       maximize the window Maximize the surface.

       After requesting that the surface should be maximized, the compositor will respond by emitting a
       configure event. Whether this configure actually sets the window maximized is subject to compositor
       policies. The client must then update its content, drawing in the configured state. The client must also
       acknowledge the configure when committing the new content (see ack_configure).

       It is up to the compositor to decide how and where to maximize the surface, for example which output and
       what region of the screen should be used.

       If the surface was already maximized, the compositor will still emit a configure event with the
       'maximized' state.

       If the surface is in a fullscreen state, this request has no direct effect. It may alter the state the
       surface is returned to when unmaximized unless overridden by the compositor.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>parent</u>

       Set the 'parent' of this surface. This surface should be stacked above the parent surface and all other
       ancestor surfaces.

       Parent windows should be set on dialogs, toolboxes, or other 'auxiliary' surfaces, so that the parent is
       raised when the dialog is raised.

       Setting a null parent for a child window removes any parent-child relationship for the child. Setting a
       null parent for a window which currently has no parent is a no-op.

       If the parent is unmapped then its children are managed as though the parent of the now-unmapped parent
       has become the parent of this surface. If no parent exists for the now-unmapped parent then the children
       are managed as though they have no parent surface.

       decorations, giving the user a menu that they can use to maximize or minimize the window.

       This request asks the compositor to pop up such a window menu at the given position, relative to the
       local surface coordinates of the parent surface. There are no guarantees as to what menu items the window
       menu contains.

       This request must be used in response to some sort of user action like a button press, key press, or
       touch down event.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void()&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>xdg_toplevel_t::on_unset_fullscreen</b> <b>()</b>
       unset the window as fullscreen Make the surface no longer fullscreen.

       After requesting that the surface should be unfullscreened, the compositor will respond by emitting a
       configure event. Whether this actually removes the fullscreen state of the client is subject to
       compositor policies.

       Making a surface unfullscreen sets states for the surface based on the following: the state(s) it may
       have had before becoming fullscreen any state(s) decided by the compositor any state(s) requested by the
       client while the surface was fullscreen

       The compositor may include the previous window geometry dimensions in the configure event, if applicable.

       The client must also acknowledge the configure when committing the new content (see ack_configure).

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void()&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>xdg_toplevel_t::on_unset_maximized</b> <b>()</b>
       unmaximize the window Unmaximize the surface.

       After requesting that the surface should be unmaximized, the compositor will respond by emitting a
       configure event. Whether this actually un-maximizes the window is subject to compositor policies. If
       available and applicable, the compositor will include the window geometry dimensions the window had prior
       to being maximized in the configure event. The client must then update its content, drawing it in the
       configured state. The client must also acknowledge the configure when committing the new content (see
       ack_configure).

       It is up to the compositor to position the surface after it was unmaximized; usually the position the
       surface had before maximizing, if applicable.

       If the surface was already not maximized, the compositor will still emit a configure event without the
       'maximized' state.

       If the surface is in a fullscreen state, this request has no direct effect. It may alter the state the
       surface is returned to when unmaximized unless overridden by the compositor.

       Post 'not enough memory' error to the client

       If the compositor has not enough memory to fulfill a certail request of the client, this function can be
