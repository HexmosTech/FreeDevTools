       toplevel surface

       This interface defines an xdg_surface role which allows a surface to, among other things, set window-like
       properties such as maximize, fullscreen, and minimize, set application-specific metadata like title and
       id, and well as trigger user interactive operations such as interactive resize and move.

   <b>void</b> <b>zxdg_toplevel_v6_t::close</b> <b>(bool</b> <b>post</b> <b>=</b> <b>true)</b>
       surface wants to be closed The close event is sent by the compositor when the user wants the surface to
       be closed. This should be equivalent to the user clicking the close button in client-side decorations, if
       your application has any.

       This is only a request that the user intends to close the window. The client may choose to ignore this
       request, or show a dialog to ask the user to save their data, etc.

       Definition at line <b>8585</b> of file <b>wayland-server-protocol-unstable.cpp</b>.

   <b>void</b> <b>zxdg_toplevel_v6_t::configure</b> <b>(int32_t</b> <b>width,</b> <b>int32_t</b> <b>height,</b> <b>array_t</b> <b>const</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>states,</b> <b>bool</b> <b>post</b> <b>=</b> <b>true)</b>
       suggest a surface change

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>width</u>
           <u>height</u>
           <u>states</u>

       This configure event asks the client to resize its toplevel surface or to change its state. The
       configured state should not be applied immediately. See xdg_surface.configure for details.

       The width and height arguments specify a hint to the window about how its surface should be resized in
       window geometry coordinates. See set_window_geometry.

       If the width or height arguments are zero, it means the client should decide its own window dimension.
       This may happen when the compositor needs to configure the state of the surface but doesn't have any
       information about any previous or expected dimension.

       The states listed in the event specify how the width/height arguments should be interpreted, and possibly
       how it should be drawn.

       Clients must send an ack_configure in response to this event. See xdg_surface.configure and
       xdg_surface.ack_configure for details.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(seat_t,</b> <b>uint32_t)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>zxdg_toplevel_v6_t::on_move</b> <b>()</b>
       start an interactive move

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>seat</u> the wl_seat of the user event
           <u>serial</u> the serial of the user event

       Start an interactive, user-driven move of the surface.

       This request must be used in response to some sort of user action like a button press, key press, or
       touch down event. The passed serial is used to determine the type of interactive move (touch, pointer,
       etc).

       The server may ignore move requests depending on the state of the surface (e.g. fullscreen or maximized),
       or if the passed serial is no longer valid.

       If triggered, the surface will lose the focus of the device (wl_pointer, wl_touch, etc) used for the
       move. It is up to the compositor to visually indicate that the move is taking place, such as updating a
       pointer cursor, during the move. There is no guarantee that the device focus will return when the move is
       completed.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(seat_t,</b> <b>uint32_t,</b> <b>zxdg_toplevel_v6_resize_edge)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>zxdg_toplevel_v6_t::on_resize</b> <b>()</b>
       start an interactive resize

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>seat</u> the wl_seat of the user event
           <u>serial</u> the serial of the user event
           <u>edges</u> which edge or corner is being dragged

       Start a user-driven, interactive resize of the surface.

       This request must be used in response to some sort of user action like a button press, key press, or
       touch down event. The passed serial is used to determine the type of interactive resize (touch, pointer,
       etc).

       The server may ignore resize requests depending on the state of the surface (e.g. fullscreen or
       maximized).

       If triggered, the client will receive configure events with the 'resize' state enum value and the
       expected sizes. See the 'resize' enum value for more details about what is required. The client must also
       acknowledge configure events using 'ack_configure'. After the resize is completed, the client will
       receive another 'configure' event without the resize state.

       If triggered, the surface also will lose the focus of the device (wl_pointer, wl_touch, etc) used for the
       resize. It is up to the compositor to visually indicate that the resize is taking place, such as updating
       a pointer cursor, during the resize. There is no guarantee that the device focus will return when the
       resize is completed.

       The edges parameter specifies how the surface should be resized, and is one of the values of the
       resize_edge enum. The compositor may use this information to update the surface position for example when
       dragging the top left corner. The compositor may also use this information to adapt its behavior, e.g.
       choose an appropriate cursor image.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(std::string)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>zxdg_toplevel_v6_t::on_set_app_id</b> <b>()</b>
       set application ID

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>app_id</u>

       Set an application identifier for the surface.

       The app ID identifies the general class of applications to which the surface belongs. The compositor can
       use this to group multiple surfaces together, or to determine how to launch a new application.

       For D-Bus activatable applications, the app ID is used as the D-Bus service name.

       The compositor shell will try to group application surfaces together by their app ID. As a best practice,
       it is suggested to select app ID's that match the basename of the application's .desktop file. For
       example, 'org.freedesktop.FooViewer' where the .desktop file is 'org.freedesktop.FooViewer.desktop'.

       See the desktop-entry specification [0] for more details on application identifiers and how they relate
       to well-known D-Bus names and .desktop files.

       set the window as fullscreen on a monitor

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>output</u>

       Make the surface fullscreen.

       You can specify an output that you would prefer to be fullscreen. If this value is NULL, it's up to the
       compositor to choose which display will be used to map this surface.

       If the surface doesn't cover the whole output, the compositor will position the surface in the center of
       the output and compensate with black borders filling the rest of the output.

       set the maximum size

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>width</u>
           <u>height</u>

       Set a maximum size for the window.

       The client can specify a maximum size so that the compositor does not try to configure the window beyond
       this size.

       The width and height arguments are in window geometry coordinates. See xdg_surface.set_window_geometry.

       Values set in this way are double-buffered. They will get applied on the next commit.

       The compositor can use this information to allow or disallow different states like maximize or fullscreen
       and draw accurate animations.

       Similarly, a tiling window manager may use this information to place and resize client windows in a more
       effective way.

       The client should not rely on the compositor to obey the maximum size. The compositor may decide to
       ignore the values set by the client and request a larger size.

       If never set, or a value of zero in the request, means that the client has no expected maximum size in
       the given dimension. As a result, a client wishing to reset the maximum size to an unspecified state can
       use zero for width and height in the request.

       Requesting a maximum size to be smaller than the minimum size of a surface is illegal and will result in
       a protocol error.

       The width and height must be greater than or equal to zero. Using strictly negative values for width and
       height will result in a protocol error.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void()&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>zxdg_toplevel_v6_t::on_set_maximized</b> <b>()</b>
       maximize the window Maximize the surface.

       After requesting that the surface should be maximized, the compositor will respond by emitting a
       configure event with the 'maximized' state and the required window geometry. The client should then
       update its content, drawing it in a maximized state, i.e. without shadow or other decoration outside of
       the window geometry. The client must also acknowledge the configure when committing the new content (see
       ack_configure).

       It is up to the compositor to decide how and where to maximize the surface, for example which output and
       what region of the screen should be used.

       If the surface was already maximized, the compositor will still emit a configure event with the
       'maximized' state.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>width</u>
           <u>height</u>

       Set a minimum size for the window.

       The client can specify a minimum size so that the compositor does not try to configure the window below
       this size.

       The width and height arguments are in window geometry coordinates. See xdg_surface.set_window_geometry.

       Clients implementing client-side decorations might want to show a context menu when right-clicking on the
       decorations, giving the user a menu that they can use to maximize or minimize the window.

       This request asks the compositor to pop up such a window menu at the given position, relative to the
       local surface coordinates of the parent surface. There are no guarantees as to what menu items the window
       menu contains.

       This request must be used in response to some sort of user action like a button press, key press, or

       unmaximize the window Unmaximize the surface.

       After requesting that the surface should be unmaximized, the compositor will respond by emitting a
       configure event without the 'maximized' state. If available, the compositor will include the window
       geometry dimensions the window had prior to being maximized in the configure request. The client must
       then update its content, drawing it in a regular state, i.e. potentially with shadow, etc. The client
       must also acknowledge the configure when committing the new content (see ack_configure).

       It is up to the compositor to position the surface after it was unmaximized; usually the position the
       surface had before maximizing, if applicable.

       If the surface was already not maximized, the compositor will still emit a configure event without the
       'maximized' state.
