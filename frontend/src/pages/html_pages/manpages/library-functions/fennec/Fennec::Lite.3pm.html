</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Fennec::Lite - Minimalist Fennec, the commonly used bits.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Fennec does a ton, but it may be hard to adopt it all at once. It also is a large project, and has not
       yet been fully split into component projects.  Fennec::Lite takes a minimalist approach to do for Fennec
       what Mouse does for Moose.

       Fennec::Lite is a single module file with no non-core dependencies. It can easily be used by any project,
       either directly, or by copying it into your project. The file itself is less than 300 lines of code at
       the time of this writing, that includes whitespace.

       This module does not cover any of the more advanced features such as result capturing or SPEC workflows.
       This module only covers test grouping and group randomization. You can also use the FENNEC_ITEM variable
       with a group name or line number to run a specific test group only. Test::Builder is used under the hood
       for TAP output.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>SIMPLE</b>
           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>
           use strict;

           # Brings in Test::More for us.
           use Fennec::Lite;

           tests good =&gt; sub {
               ok( 1, "A good test" );
           };

           # You most call run_tests() after declaring your tests.
           run_tests();
           done_testing();

               ],
               alias_to =&gt; {

               my $string = @_;
               return bless({ construction_string =&gt; $string }, $class );
           }

               is(
                   $self-&gt;construction_string,
                   "This is the construction string",
                   "Constructed properly"
               );

               skip =&gt; "This will fail badly",
               sub =&gt; sub { die "oops" },
           );

           run_tests( "This is the construction string" );

   <b>Pure</b> <b>OO</b> <b>Interface</b>
           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>
           use strict;
           use warnings;

           use Fennec::Lite ();
           use Test::More;

           my $fennec = Fennec::Lite-&gt;new( test_class =&gt; __PACKAGE__ );

           $fennec-&gt;add_tests( "test name" =&gt; sub {
               ok( ... );
           });

           $fennec-&gt;run_tests;

           done_testing();

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTED</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>YOU</b></h4><pre>
       When you use Fennec::Lite, Test::More is automatically imported for you. In addition Test::Warn and
       Test::Exception will also be loaded, but only if they are installed.

</pre><h4><b>IMPORT</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
           use Fennec::Lite %ARGS

       plan =&gt; 'no_plan' || $count
           Plan to pass into Test::More.

       random =&gt; $bool
           True by default. When true test groups will be run in random order.

       testing =&gt; $CLASS_NAME
           Declare what class you ore testing. Provides $CLASS and <b>CLASS()</b>, both of which are simply the name of
           the class being tested.

       alias =&gt; @PACKAGES
           Create  alias functions your the given package. An alias is a function that returns the package name.
           The aliases will be named after the last part of the package name.

       alias_to =&gt; { $ALIAS =&gt; $PACKAGE, ... }
           Define aliases, keys are alias names, values are tho package names they should return.

</pre><h4><b>RUNNING</b> <b>IN</b> <b>RANDOM</b> <b>ORDER</b></h4><pre>
       By default test groups will be run in a random order. The random seed is  the  current  date  (YYYYMMDD).
       This  is  used  so that the order does not change on the day you are editing your code. However the ardor
       will change daily allowing for automated testing to find order dependent failures.

       You can manually set the random seed to reproduce a failure. The FENNEC_SEED environment variable will be
       used as the seed when it is present.

           $ FENNEC_SEED="20100915" prove -I lib -v t/*.t

</pre><h4><b>RUNNING</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>GROUPS</b></h4><pre>
       You can use the FENNEC_ITEM variable with a group name or line number to run a specific test group only.

           $ FENNEC_ITEM="22" prove -I lib -v t/MyTest.t
           $ FENNEC_ITEM="Test Group A" prove -I lib -v t/MyTest.t

       This can easily be integrated into an editor such as vim or emacs.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTED</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       tests $name =&gt; $coderef,
       tests $name =&gt; ( code =&gt; $coderef, todo =&gt; $reason )
       tests $name =&gt; ( code =&gt; $coderef, skip =&gt; $reason )
       tests $name =&gt; ( sub =&gt; $coderef )
       tests $name =&gt; ( method =&gt; $coderef )
           Declare a test group. The first argument must always be the test group name. In the 2 part  form  the
           second  argument  must  be  a coderef. In the multi-part form you may optionally declare the group as
           todo, or as a skip. A coderef must always be provided, in multi-part  form  you  may  use  the  code,
           method, or sub params for this purpose, they are all the same.

       run_tests( %params )
           Instantiate  an instance of the test class, passing %params to the constructor.  If no constructor is
           present a default is used. All tests that have been added will be run. All tests will be cleared, you
           may continue to declare tests and call run_tests again to run the new tests.

       <b>fennec()</b>
           Returns the instance of Fennec::Lite created when you imported it. This is the instance that  <b>tests()</b>
           and <b>run_tests()</b> act upon.

       fennec_accessors( @NAMES )
           Quickly generate get/set accessors for your test class. You could alternatively do it manually or use
           Moose.

</pre><h4><b>PURE</b> <b>OO</b> <b>INTERFACE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $tests_ref = $fennec-&gt;<b>tests()</b>
           Get a reference to the array of tests that have been added since the last run.

       $classname = $fennec-&gt;test_class( $classname )
           Get/Set  the class name that will be used to create test objects that will act as the invocant on all
           test methods.

       $seed = $fennec-&gt;seed( $newseed )
           Get/Set the random seed that will be used to re-seed <b>srand()</b> before randomizing  tests,  as  well  as
           before each test.

       $bool = $fennec-&gt;random( $bool )
           Turn random on/off.

       $fennec-&gt;add_tests( $name =&gt; sub { ... })
       $fennec-&gt;add_tests( $name, %args, method =&gt; sub { ... })
           Add a test group.

       $fennec-&gt;run_tests( %test_class_construction_args )
           Run the test groups

       $bool = $fennec-&gt;run_skip_test( \%test )
           Run a skip test (really just returns true)

       $bool = $fennec-&gt;run_todo_group( \%test )
           Run a group as TODO

       $bool = $fennec-&gt;run_test_group( \%test )
           Run a test group.

       ( $bool, $error ) = $fennec-&gt;run_test_eval( \%test )
           Does the actual test running in an eval to capture errors.

       $fennec-&gt;test_eval_error( $bool, $error, \%test )
           Handle a test eval error.

</pre><h4><b>Extending</b> <b>Fennec::Lite</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  tradition  of the Fennec project, Fennec::Lite is designed to be extensible. You can even easily
       subclass/edit Fennec::Lite to work with alternatives to Test::Builder.

   <b>METHODS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>OVERRIDE</b>
       $fennec-&gt;<b>init()</b>
           Called by  new  prior  to  returning  the  newly  constructed  object.  In  Fennec::Lite  this  loads
           Test::Builder  and  puts  a  reference  to  it  in  the  <b>TB()</b>  accessor.  If  you  do want to replace
           Test::Builder in your subclass you may do so by overriding <b>init()</b>.

       $fennec-&gt;run_skip_test( \%test )
           Calls Test::Builder-&gt;skip( $reason ), then returns true. Override this if you  replace  Test::Builder
           in your subclass.

       $fennec-&gt;run_todo_group( \%test )
           Calls  <b>run_test_eval()</b>  in  a  TODO environment. Currently uses Test::Builder to start/stop TODO mode
           around the test. Override this if you wish to replace Test::Builder.

       $fennec-&gt;test_eval_error( $bool, $error, \%test )
           Handle an exception thrown in a test group method. Currently calls Test::Bulder-&gt;ok( 0, GROUP_NAME ).

       @list = <b>must_load()</b>
           Returns a list of modules that MUST be loaded into tho calling class (unless used in OO  form).  This
           is currently only Test::More.

       @list = <b>may_load()</b>
           Returns a list of modules that should be loaded only if they are installed.

       $name_to_code_ref = <b>module_loaders()</b>
           Returns a hashref containing package =&gt; sub { ... }. Use this if you need to load modules in a custom
           way, currently Test::More has a special loader in here to account for plans.

       $fennec-&gt;<b>import_hook()</b>
           Called  on  the  instance  that  was created by <b>import()</b>, runs at the very end of the import process.
           Currently does nothing.

</pre><h4><b>FENNEC</b> <b>PROJECT</b></h4><pre>
       This module is part of the Fennec project. See Fennec for more details.  Fennec is a project  to  develop
       an  extensible  and  powerful  testing  framework.   Together the tools that make up the Fennec framework
       provide a potent testing environment.

       The tools provided by Fennec are also useful on their own. Sometimes a tool created for Fennec is  useful
       outside the greater framework. Such tools are turned into their own projects. This is one such project.

       Fennec - The core framework
         The primary Fennec project that ties them all together.
