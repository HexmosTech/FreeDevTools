       PDLACON - estimate the 1-norm of a square, real distributed matrix A

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       SUBROUTINE PDLACON( N, V, IV, JV, DESCV, X, IX, JX, DESCX, ISGN, EST, KASE )

           INTEGER         IV, IX, JV, JX, KASE, N

           DOUBLE          PRECISION EST

           INTEGER         DESCV( * ), DESCX( * ), ISGN( * )

           DOUBLE          PRECISION V( * ), X( * )

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       PDLACON  estimates  the 1-norm of a square, real distributed matrix A.  Reverse communication is used for
       evaluating matrix-vector products.  X and V are aligned with the distributed matrix A,  this  information
       is implicitly contained within IV, IX, DESCV, and DESCX.

       Notes
       =====

       Each  global  data  object  is  described  by  an  associated description vector.  This vector stores the
       information required to establish the mapping between an object element and its corresponding process and
       memory location.

       Let A be a generic term for any 2D block  cyclicly  distributed  array.   Such  a  global  array  has  an
       associated  description  vector  DESCA.  In the following comments, the character _ should be read as "of
       the global array".

       NOTATION        STORED IN      EXPLANATION
       --------------- -------------- -------------------------------------- DTYPE_A(global) DESCA( DTYPE_  )The
       descriptor type.  In this case,
                                      DTYPE_A = 1.
       CTXT_A (global) DESCA( CTXT_ ) The BLACS context handle, indicating
                                      the BLACS process grid A is distribu-
                                      ted over. The context itself is glo-
                                      bal, but the handle (the integer
                                      value) may vary.
       M_A    (global) DESCA( M_ )    The number of rows in the global
                                      array A.
       N_A    (global) DESCA( N_ )    The number of columns in the global
                                      array A.
       MB_A   (global) DESCA( MB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the rows of the array.
       NB_A   (global) DESCA( NB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the columns of the array.
       RSRC_A (global) DESCA( RSRC_ ) The process row over which the first
                                      row  of  the  array  A is distributed.  CSRC_A (global) DESCA( CSRC_ ) The
       process column over which the
                                      first column of the array A is
                                      distributed.
       LLD_A  (local)  DESCA( LLD_ )  The leading dimension of the local
                                      array.  LLD_A &gt;= MAX(1,LOCr(M_A)).

       Let K be the number of rows or columns of a distributed matrix, and assume  that  its  process  grid  has
       dimension p x q.
       LOCr( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process would receive if K were distributed over the
       p processes of its process column.
       Similarly,  LOCc(  K  )  denotes  the  number  of  elements  of  K that a process would receive if K were
       distributed over the q processes of its process row.
       The values of LOCr() and LOCc() may be determined via a call to the ScaLAPACK tool function, NUMROC:
               LOCr( M ) = NUMROC( M, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ),
               LOCc( N ) = NUMROC( N, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ).  An upper bound for these quantities may  be
       computed by:
               LOCr( M ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(M/MB_A)/NPROW )*MB_A
               LOCc( N ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(N/NB_A)/NPCOL )*NB_A

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       N       (global input) INTEGER
               The length of the distributed vectors V and X.  N &gt;= 0.

       V       (local workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION pointer into the local
               memory to an array of dimension LOCr(N+MOD(IV-1,MB_V)). On the final return, V = A*W, where EST =
               norm(V)/norm(W) (W is not returned).

       IV      (global input) INTEGER
               The row index in the global array V indicating the first row of sub( V ).

       JV      (global input) INTEGER
               The column index in the global array V indicating the first column of sub( V ).

       DESCV   (global and local input) INTEGER array of dimension DLEN_.
               The array descriptor for the distributed matrix V.

       X       (local input/local output) DOUBLE PRECISION pointer into the
               local memory to an array of dimension LOCr(N+MOD(IX-1,MB_X)). On an intermediate return, X should
               be  overwritten by A * X,   if KASE=1, A' * X,  if KASE=2, PDLACON must be re-called with all the
               other parameters unchanged.

       IX      (global input) INTEGER
               The row index in the global array X indicating the first row of sub( X ).

       JX      (global input) INTEGER
               The column index in the global array X indicating the first column of sub( X ).

       DESCX   (global and local input) INTEGER array of dimension DLEN_.
               The array descriptor for the distributed matrix X.

       ISGN    (local workspace) INTEGER array, dimension
               LOCr(N+MOD(IX-1,MB_X)). ISGN is aligned with X and V.

       EST     (global output) DOUBLE PRECISION
               An estimate (a lower bound) for norm(A).

       KASE    (local input/local output) INTEGER
               On the initial call to PDLACON, KASE should be 0.  On an intermediate return, KASE will be  1  or
               2,  indicating  whether  X  should  be overwritten by A * X  or A' * X.  On the final return from
               PDLACON, KASE will again be 0.
