       PCGELS - solve overdetermined or underdetermined complex linear systems involving an M-by-N matrix sub( A
       ) = A(IA:IA+M-1,JA:JA+N-1),

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       SUBROUTINE PCGELS( TRANS, M, N, NRHS, A, IA, JA, DESCA, B, IB, JB, DESCB, WORK, LWORK, INFO )

           CHARACTER      TRANS

           INTEGER        IA, IB, INFO, JA, JB, LWORK, M, N, NRHS

           INTEGER        DESCA( * ), DESCB( * )

           COMPLEX        A( * ), B( * ), WORK( * )

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       PCGELS  solves overdetermined or underdetermined complex linear systems involving an M-by-N matrix sub( A
       ) = A(IA:IA+M-1,JA:JA+N-1), or its conjugate-transpose, using a QR or LQ factorization of sub( A  ).   It
       is assumed that sub( A ) has full rank.

       The following options are provided:

       1. If TRANS = 'N' and m &gt;= n:  find the least squares solution of
          an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
                       minimize || sub( B ) - sub( A )*X ||.

       2. If TRANS = 'N' and m &lt; n:  find the minimum norm solution of
          an underdetermined system sub( A ) * X = sub( B ).

       3. If TRANS = 'C' and m &gt;= n:  find the minimum norm solution of
          an undetermined system sub( A )**H * X = sub( B ).

       4. If TRANS = 'C' and m &lt; n:  find the least squares solution of
          an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
                       minimize || sub( B ) - sub( A )**H * X ||.

       where  sub(  B  )  denotes B( IB:IB+M-1, JB:JB+NRHS-1 ) when TRANS = 'N' and B( IB:IB+N-1, JB:JB+NRHS-1 )
       otherwise. Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be handled in a single call; When
       TRANS = 'N', the solution vectors are stored as the columns of the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix  sub(
       B ) and the M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix sub( B ) otherwise.

       Notes
       =====

       Each  global  data  object  is  described  by  an  associated description vector.  This vector stores the
       information required to establish the mapping between an object element and its corresponding process and
       memory location.

       Let A be a generic term for any 2D block  cyclicly  distributed  array.   Such  a  global  array  has  an
       associated  description  vector  DESCA.  In the following comments, the character _ should be read as "of
       the global array".

       NOTATION        STORED IN      EXPLANATION
       --------------- -------------- -------------------------------------- DTYPE_A(global) DESCA( DTYPE_  )The
       descriptor type.  In this case,
                                      DTYPE_A = 1.
       CTXT_A (global) DESCA( CTXT_ ) The BLACS context handle, indicating
                                      the BLACS process grid A is distribu-
                                      ted over. The context itself is glo-
                                      bal, but the handle (the integer
                                      value) may vary.
       M_A    (global) DESCA( M_ )    The number of rows in the global
                                      array A.
       N_A    (global) DESCA( N_ )    The number of columns in the global
                                      array A.
       MB_A   (global) DESCA( MB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the rows of the array.
       NB_A   (global) DESCA( NB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the columns of the array.
       RSRC_A (global) DESCA( RSRC_ ) The process row over which the first
                                      row  of  the  array  A is distributed.  CSRC_A (global) DESCA( CSRC_ ) The
       process column over which the
                                      first column of the array A is
                                      distributed.
       LLD_A  (local)  DESCA( LLD_ )  The leading dimension of the local
                                      array.  LLD_A &gt;= MAX(1,LOCr(M_A)).

       Let K be the number of rows or columns of a distributed matrix, and assume  that  its  process  grid  has
       dimension p x q.
       LOCr( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process would receive if K were distributed over the
       p processes of its process column.
       Similarly,  LOCc(  K  )  denotes  the  number  of  elements  of  K that a process would receive if K were
       distributed over the q processes of its process row.
       The values of LOCr() and LOCc() may be determined via a call to the ScaLAPACK tool function, NUMROC:
               LOCr( M ) = NUMROC( M, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ),
               LOCc( N ) = NUMROC( N, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ).  An upper bound for these quantities may  be
       computed by:
               LOCr( M ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(M/MB_A)/NPROW )*MB_A
               LOCc( N ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(N/NB_A)/NPCOL )*NB_A

       N       (global input) INTEGER
               The  number of columns to be operated on, i.e. the number of columns of the distributed submatrix

               The number of right hand sides, i.e. the number of columns of the distributed submatrices sub(  B
               ) and X.  NRHS &gt;= 0.

       A       (local input/local output) COMPLEX pointer into the
               local memory to an array of local dimension ( LLD_A, LOCc(JA+N-1) ).  On entry, the M-by-N matrix
               A.  if M &gt;= N, sub( A ) is overwritten by details of its QR factorization as returned by PCGEQRF;
               if M &lt;  N, sub( A ) is overwritten by details of its LQ factorization as returned by PCGELQF.

       IA      (global input) INTEGER

               contains the local pieces of the  distributed  matrix  B  of  right  hand  side  vectors,  stored
               columnwise;  sub(  B  ) is M-by-NRHS if TRANS='N', and N-by-NRHS otherwise.  On exit, sub( B ) is
               overwritten by the solution vectors, stored columnwise:  if TRANS = 'N' and M &gt;= N, rows 1  to  N
               of  sub(  B  )  contain  the  least squares solution vectors; the residual sum of squares for the
               solution in each column is given by the sum of squares of elements N+1 to M in  that  column;  if
               TRANS  =  'N'  and  M  &lt; N, rows 1 to N of sub( B ) contain the minimum norm solution vectors; if

       WORK    (local workspace/local output) COMPLEX array,
               dimension (LWORK) On exit, <a href="../man1/WORK.1.html">WORK</a>(1) returns the minimal and optimal LWORK.

       LWORK   (local or global input) INTEGER
               The  dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK is local input and must be at least LWORK &gt;= LTAU + MAX(
               LWF, LWS ) where If M &gt;= N, then LTAU = NUMROC( JA+MIN(M,N)-1, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ),  LWF

               NB_A Else LTAU = NUMROC( IA+MIN(M,N)-1, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ), LWF  = MB_A * ( MpA0 + NqA0
               + MB_A ) LWS  = MAX( (MB_A*(MB_A-1))/2, ( NpB0 + MAX( NqA0 + NUMROC( NUMROC( N+IROFFB,  MB_A,  0,
               0, NPROW ), MB_A, 0, 0, LCMP ), NRHSqB0 ) )*MB_A ) + MB_A * MB_A End if

               where LCMP = LCM / NPROW with LCM = ILCM( NPROW, NPCOL ),

               NRHS+ICOFFB, NB_B, MYCOL, IBCOL, NPCOL ),

               ILCM, INDXG2P and NUMROC are ScaLAPACK tool functions; MYROW,  MYCOL,  NPROW  and  NPCOL  can  be
               determined by calling the subroutine BLACS_GRIDINFO.

               If  LWORK  =  -1,  then  LWORK is global input and a workspace query is assumed; the routine only
               calculates the minimum and optimal size for all work arrays. Each of these values is returned  in
               the first entry of the corresponding work array, and no error message is issued by PXERBLA.

       INFO    (global output) INTEGER
               = 0:  successful exit
               &lt;  0:   If  the  i-th  argument  is  an  array  and the j-entry had an illegal value, then INFO =
               -(i*100+j), if the i-th argument is a scalar and had an illegal value, then INFO = -i.
