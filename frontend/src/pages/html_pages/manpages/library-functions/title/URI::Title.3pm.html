</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       URI::Title - get the titles of things on the web in a sensible way

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.904

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use URI::Title qw( title );
         my $title = title('<a href="http://microsoft.com">http://microsoft.com</a>');
         print "Title is $title\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       I keep having to find the title of things on the web. This seems like a really simple request, just <b>get()</b>
       the object, parse for a title tag, you're done. Ha, I wish. There are several problems with this
       approach:

       What if the resource is on a very slow server? Do we wait for ever or what?
       What if the resource is a 900 gig file? You don't want to download that.
       What if the page title isn't in a title tag, but is buried in the HTML somewhere?
       What if the resource is an MP3 file, or a word document or something?
       ...

       So, let's solve these issues once.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       only one, the title(url) method. Call it with an url, get the title if possible, undef if it wasn't. Very
       simple.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       WWW::GetPageTitle  - similar this module, but just handles web pages.  The author of that module suggests
       you should use "URI::Title".

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Embedded title metadata of png files can be extracted if you have  installed  either  Image::ExifTool  or
       Image::PNG::Libpng.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       Many, many, many things. Still unimplemented:

       Get titles of MP3 files, Word Docs, PDFs, etc.
       Configurable.. well, anything, in fact. Timeout would be a good start.
       Better error reporting.

</pre><h4><b>CREDITS</b></h4><pre>
       Invented because of a conversation with rjp, who contributed some eyeball-melting and as-yet-unused  code
       to  get titles from MP3s and PDFs, and hex, who has also solved the problem, and got bits done in a nicer
       way than I did.
