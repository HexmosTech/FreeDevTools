</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Term::Clui.pm - Perl module offering a Command-Line User Interface

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Term::Clui;
        $chosen = choose("A Title", @a_list);  # single choice
        @chosen = choose("A Title", @a_list);  # multiple choice
        # multi-line question-texts are possible...
        $x = choose("Which ?\n(Mouse, or Arrow-keys and Return)", @w);
        $x = choose("Which ?\n".help_text(), @w);

        if (confirm($text)) { do_something(); };

        $answer = ask($question);
        $answer = ask($question,$suggestion);
        $password = ask_password("Enter password:");
        $filename = ask_filename("Which file ?");  # with Tab-completion

        $newtext = edit($title, $oldtext);
        edit($filename);

        view($title, $text)  # if $title is not a filename
        view($textfile)  # if $textfile _is_ a filename

        edit(choose("Edit which file ?", grep(-T, readdir D)));

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Term::Clui offers a high-level user interface to give the user of command-line applications a consistent
       "look and feel".  Its metaphor for the computer is as a human-like conversation-partner, and as each
       question/response is completed it is summarised onto one line, and remains on screen, so that the history
       of the session gradually accumulates on the screen and is available for review, or for cut/paste.  This
       user interface can therefore be intermixed with standard applications which write to STDOUT or STDERR,
       such as <u>make</u>, <u>pgp</u>, <u>rcs</u> etc.

       For the user, <u><b>choose()</b></u> uses either (since 1.50) the mouse; or arrow keys (or hjkl) and Return; also <b>q</b> to
       quit, and SpaceBar or Button3 to highlight multiple choices.  <u><b>confirm()</b></u> expects y, Y, n or N.  In
       general, ctrl-L redraws the (currently active bit of the) screen.  <u><b>edit()</b></u> and <u><b>view()</b></u> use the default
       EDITOR and PAGER if possible.

       It's fast, simple, and has few external dependencies.  It doesn't use <u>curses</u> (which is a whole-of-screen
       interface); it uses a small subset of vt100 sequences (up down left right normal and reverse) which are
       very portable, and also (since 1.50) the <u>SET_ANY_EVENT_MOUSE</u> and <u>kmous</u> (terminfo) sequences, which are
       supported by all <u>xterm</u>, <u>rxvt</u>, <u>konsole</u>, <u>screen</u>, <u>linux</u>, <u>gnome</u> and <u>putty</u> terminals.

       There is an associated file selector, Term::Clui::FileSelect

       Since version 1.60, a speaking interface is provided for the visually-impaired user; it employs <u>eflite</u> or
       <u>espeak</u>.  Speech is turned on if the <u>CLUI_SPEAK</u> environment variable is set to any non-empty string.
       Since version 1.62, if <u>speakup</u> is running, it is silenced while Term::Clui runs, and then restored.
       Because Term::Clui's metaphor for the computer is a human-like conversation-partner, this works very
       naturally.  The application needs no modification.

       There is an equivalent Python3 module, with (as far as possible) the same calling interface, at
       <a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/PJB/Term-Clui-1.71/py/TermClui.py">http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/PJB/Term-Clui-1.71/py/TermClui.py</a>

       This is Term::Clui.pm version 1.71

</pre><h4><b>WINDOW-SIZE</b></h4><pre>
       Term::Clui attempts to handle the WINCH signal.  If the window size is changed, then as soon as the user
       enters the next keystroke (such as ctrl-L) the current question/response will be redisplayed to fit the
       new size.

       The first line of the question, the one which will remain on-screen, is not re-formatted, but is left to
       be dealt with by the width of the window.  Subsequent lines are split into blank-separated words which
       are filled into the available width; lines beginning with white-space are treated as the beginning of a
       new indented paragraph, individual words which will not fit onto one line are truncated, and successive
       blank lines are collapsed into one.  If the question will not fit within the available rows, it is
       truncated.

       If the available choice items in a <u><b>choose()</b></u> overflow the screen, the user is asked to enter "clue"
       letters, and as soon as the items matching them will fit onto the screen they are displayed as a choice.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>ask</u>( $question );  OR <u>ask</u>( $question, $default );
          Asks  the user the question and returns a string answer, with no newline character at the end.  If the
          optional second argument is present, it is offered to the user as a  default.   If  the  <u>$question</u>  is
          multi-line, the entry-field is at the top to the right of the first line, and the subsequent lines are
          formatted within the screen width and displayed beneath, as with <u>choose</u>.

          For  the  user,  left  and  right  arrow keys move backward and forward through the string, delete and
          backspace erase the previous character, ctrl-A moves to the beginning, ctrl-E to the end,  and  ctrl-D
          or ctrl-X clear the current string.

       <u>ask_password</u>( $question );
          Does the same with no echo, as used for password entry.

       <u>ask_filename</u>( $question );
          Uses <u>Term::ReadLine::Gnu</u> to provide filename-completion with the <u>Tab</u> key, but also displays multi-line
          questions in the same way as <u>ask</u> and <u>choose</u> do.  This function was introduced in version 1.65.

       <u>choose</u>( $question, @list );
          Displays the question, and formats the list items onto the lines beneath it.

          If  <u>choose</u>  is  called in a scalar context, the user can choose an item using arrow keys (or hjkl) and
          Return, or cancel the choice with a "q".  <u>choose</u> then returns the chosen item,  or  <u>undefined</u>  if  the
          choice was cancelled.

          If  <u>choose</u>  is  called  in an array context, the user can also mark an item with the SpaceBar.  <u>choose</u>
          then returns the list of marked items, (including the item highlit when Return  was  pressed),  or  an
          empty array if the choice was cancelled.

          A  DBM  database  is  maintained  of  the question and its chosen response.  The next time the user is
          offered a choice with the same question, if that response is still in the list it  is  highlighted  as
          the  default;  otherwise  the  first  item  is highlighted.  Different parts of the code, or different
          applications using <u>Term::Clui.pm</u> can therefore exchange defaults simply by  using  the  same  question
          words,  such as "Which printer ?".  Multiple choices are not remembered, as the danger exists that the
          user might fail to notice some of the highlit items (for example, all the items might not fit onto one
          screen).

          The database <u><a href="file:~/.clui_dir/choices">~/.clui_dir/choices</a></u> or <u>$ENV{CLUI_DIR}/choices</u> is available  to  be  read  or  written  if
          lower-level   manipulation   is   needed,   and  the  <u>EXPORT_OK</u>  routines  <u>get_default</u>($question)  and
          <u>set_default</u>($question, $choice) should be used for this purpose, as they  handle  DBM's  problem  with
          concurrent  accesses.   The  whole  default  database mechanism can be disabled by <u>CLUI_DIR=OFF</u> if you
          really want to :-(

          If the items won't fit on the screen, the user is asked to enter a substring as a clue. As soon as the
          matching items will fit, they are displayed to be chosen as normal. If the user pressed  "q"  at  this
          choice,  they are asked if they wish to change their substring clue; if they reply "n" to this, choose
          quits and returns <u>undefined</u>.

          If the $question is multi-line, The first line is put at the top as usual with  the  choices  arranged
          beneath  it;  the  subsequent lines are formatted within the screen width and displayed at the bottom.
          After the choice is made all but the first line is erased, and the first line remains  on-screen  with
          the  choice  appended  after it.  You should therefore try to arrange multi-line questions so that the
          first line is the question in short form, and subsequent lines are explanation and elaboration.

       <u>confirm</u>( $question );
          Asks the question, takes "y", "n", "Y" or "N" as a response.  If the $question  is  multi-line,  after
          the  response,  all  but the first line is erased, and the first line remains on-screen with <u>Yes</u> or <u>No</u>
          appended after it; you should therefore try to arrange multi-line questions so that the first line  is
          the  question  in  short  form, and subsequent lines are explanation and elaboration.  Returns true or
          false.

       <u>edit</u>( $title, $text );  OR  <u>edit</u>( $filename );
          Uses the environment variable EDITOR ( or <u>vi</u> :-) Uses RCS if directory RCS/ exists

       <u>sorry</u>( $message );
          Similar to <u>warn</u> <u>"Sorry,</u> <u>$message\n";</u>

       <u>inform</u>( $message );
          Similar to <u>warn</u> <u>"$message\n";</u> except that it doesn't add the newline at the end if  there  already  is
          one, and it uses <u>/dev/tty</u> rather than <u>STDERR</u> if it can.

       <u>view</u>( $title, $text );  OR  <u>view</u>( $filename );
          If  the  <u>$text</u>  is longer than a screenful, uses the environment variable PAGER ( or <u>less</u> ) to display
          it.  If it is one or two lines it just omits the title and displays it.  Otherwise it  uses  a  simple
          built-in  routine  which  expects  either  "q" or <u>Return</u> from the user; if the user presses <u>Return</u> the
          displayed text remains on the screen and the dialogue continues after it, if the user presses "q"  the
          text is erased.

          If  there  is  only one argument and it's a filename, then the user's PAGER displays it, except (since
          1.65) if it's a <u>.doc</u> file, when either <u>wvText</u>, <u>antiword</u> or <u>catdoc</u> is  used  to  extract  its  contents
          first.

       <u>help_text</u>( $mode );
          This returns a short help message for the user.  If <u>mode</u> is "ask" then the text describes the keys the
          user has available when responding to an <u>&amp;ask</u> question; If <u>mode</u> is "multi" then the text describes the
          keys  and  mouse actions the user has available when responding to a multiple-choice <u>&amp;choose</u> question;
          otherwise, the text describes the keys and mouse actions the user has available when responding  to  a
          single-choice <u>&amp;choose</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORT_OK</b> <b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  routines  are not exported by default, but are exported under the <u>ALL</u> tag, so if you need
       them you should:

        import Term::Clui qw(:ALL);

       <u>beep</u>()
          Beeps.

       <u>timestamp</u>()
          Returns a sortable timestamp string in "YYYYMMDD hhmmss" form.

       <u>get_default</u>( $question )
          Consults the database <u><a href="file:~/.clui_dir/choices">~/.clui_dir/choices</a></u> or <u>$ENV{CLUI_DIR}/choices</u> and returns the  choice  that  the
          user made the last time this question was asked.  This is better than opening the database directly as
          it handles DBM's problem with concurrent accesses.

       <u>set_default</u>( $question, $new_default )
          Opens  the  database <u><a href="file:~/.clui_dir/choices">~/.clui_dir/choices</a></u> or <u>$ENV{CLUI_DIR}/choices</u> and sets the default response which
          will be offered to the user made the next time this question is asked.  This is  better  than  opening
          the database directly as it handles DBM's problem with concurrent accesses.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       It  requires  Exporter, which is core Perl.  It uses Term::ReadKey if it's available; and uses Term::Size
       if it's available; if not, it tries <u>tput</u> before guessing 80x24.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The environment variable <u>CLUI_DIR</u> can be used (by programmer or user)  to  override  <u><a href="file:~/.clui_dir">~/.clui_dir</a></u>  as  the
       directory in which <u><b>choose()</b></u> keeps its database of previous choices.  The whole default database mechanism
       can be disabled by <u>CLUI_DIR</u> <u>=</u> <u>OFF</u> if you really want to :-(

       If  either  the  LANG  or  the  LC_TYPE  environment  variables  contain  the  string <u>utf8</u> or <u>utf-8</u> (case
       insensitive), then <u><b>choose()</b></u> and <u><b>inform()</b></u> open <u>/dev/tty</u> with a <u>utf8</u> encoding.

       If the environment variable <u>CLUI_SPEAK</u> is set or  if  <u>EDITOR</u>  is  set  to  <u>emacspeak</u>,  and  if  <u>flite</u>  is
       installed, then <u>Term::Clui</u> will use <u>flite</u> to speak its questions and choices out loud.

       If  the  environment  variable  <u>CLUI_MOUSE</u> is set to <u>OFF</u> then <u><b>choose()</b></u> will not interpret mouse-clicks as
       making a choice.  The advantage of this is that the mouse can then be used to highlight  and  paste  text
       from this window as usual.

       <u>Term::Clui</u> also consults the environment variables HOME, LOGDIR, EDITOR and PAGER, if they are set.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       These scripts using Term::Clui and Term::Clui::FileSelect are to be found in the <u>examples</u> subdirectory of
       the build directory.

       <u>linux_admin</u>
          I use this script a lot at work, for routine system administration of linux boxes, particularly Fedora
          and Debian.  It includes crontab, chkconfig, update-rc.d, visudo, vipw, starting and stopping daemons,
          reconfiguring  squid  samba  or  apache,  editing  sysconfig  or  running  any  of the system-config-*
          utilities, and much else.

       <u>audio_stuff</u>
          This script offers  an  arrow-key-and-return  interface  integrating  aplaymidi,  cdrecord,  cdda2wav,
          icedax, lame, mkisofs, muscript, normalize, normalize-audio, mpg123, sndfile-play, timidity, wodim and
          so on, allowing audio files to be ripped, burned, played, or converted between Muscript, MIDI, WAV and
          MP3 formats.

       <u>login_shell</u>
          This  script offers the naive user arrow-key-and-return access to a text-based browser, a mail client,
          a news client, ssh and ftp and various other stuff.

       <u>test_script</u>
          This is the test script, as used during development.

       <u>choose</u>
          This is a script which wraps Term::Clui::choose for use at  the  shell-script  level.  It  can  either
          choose  between  command-line arguments, or, with the <b>-f</b> (filter) option, between lines of STDIN, like
          grep.  A <b>-m</b> (multiple) option allows multiple-choice.  This can be a very useful script, and  you  may
          want to copy it into <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin/">/usr/local/bin/</a></u> or elsewhere in your PATH.
