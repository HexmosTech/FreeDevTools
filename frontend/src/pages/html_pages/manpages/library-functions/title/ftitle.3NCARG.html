</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       FTITLE - Used for unscrolled movie or video titles. It reads, from standard input, the information
       necessary to define the desired title frames, and then calls STITLE to create those frames.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL FTITLE (MTST)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_ftitle (int mtst)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MTST        (an  input expression of type INTEGER) is a switch indicating whether this is a "real" run or
                   a "practice" run:

                   0      means "real run".

                   1      means "practice run".

                   During real runs, each title frame is repeated as many times as necessary to display it for a
                   user-specified time period (at ´NFS´ frames per second). Blank frames are placed  before  the
                   first  title  frame  (´TM1´  seconds  worth of them), between consecutive title frames (´TM2´
                   seconds worth of them), and after the last title frame (´TM2´ + ´TM3´ seconds worth of them).
                   Blank frames are to allow for splicing.

                   If the user has turned on fade-in (by setting the internal parameter ´FIN´ non-zero),  and/or
                   fade-out  (by  setting the internal parameter ´FOU´ non-zero), the required fade-in and fade-
                   out frames will be generated, as well.

                   During practice runs, each title frame will occur from one to three times (once for  fade-in,
                   once  for the stationary holding time, and once for fade-out); each of these frames will have
                   a legend indicating how many seconds the frame represents in a real  run.  Each  sequence  of
                   blank  frames  will  be replaced by a single frame with a message indicating how many seconds
                   worth of blank frames it represents.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument description is the same as the FORTRAN argument description.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       FTITLE reads data from the unit specified by the internal parameter ´ICU´, which has the default value 5,
       to specify standard input; this parameter can be given a different value to  specify  that  another  unit
       should be read instead.

       The  input  data  are read in groups.  Each group represents one title frame.  There can be any number of
       groups.  FTITLE keeps processing groups until a group with  NCDS  =  0  is  read  or  an  end-of-file  is
       encountered.  A group consists of the following:

       •   A  header  line  from  which  variables  NCDS,  TIME,  and  SIZE  are  read, using the FORTRAN format
           "(I5,2F5.1)".

           NCDS is the number of text lines that follow.  If NCDS = 0, FTITLE  quits  (returns  to  the  calling
           routine without doing anything else).

           TIME  is  the  time,  in seconds, that the title frame should be displayed (not including fade-in and
           fade-out, if any).

           SIZE is the desired character size, given as a multiplier of the  default  height  specified  by  the
           value  of  the  internal  parameter ´PSZ´, the default value of which is 21 (out of 1023).  Values of
           SIZE from .75 to 2.5 are recommended.

       •   Text lines, each containing one line of the title frame.  PLOTCHAR function  codes  may  be  used  as
           specified in the documentation for that package.  Characters should not appear beyond column 80.

       The  internal  parameters  'ALN',  'BGB',  'BGC', 'BGF', 'BGG', 'BGR', 'FGB', 'FGC', 'FGF', 'FGG', 'FGR',
       'FIN', 'FOU', 'GSZ', 'ICO', 'ICU', 'LOG', 'LX1', 'LX2', 'LY1', 'LY2', 'MAP', 'NFS', 'NXE', 'NXS',  'ORV',
       'PSZ',  'SBK',  'SFG', 'TM1', 'TM2', 'TM3', 'VPB', 'VPL', 'VPR', 'VPT', and 'WID' all affect the behavior
       of FTITLE in one way or another.  Some of these have been mentioned above; all are described in the "man"
       page for "scrolled_title_params".

       Example: Suppose the input file contains the following three lines

           3   3.  1.5
       A
       Frame
       of Titles

       The resulting title frame has three lines of text.  It is displayed for three seconds.  Characters have a
       size of 1.5 times the default character size.

       FTITLE allows a maximum of 80 characters per line of text including Plotchar  function  codes.   No  more
       than  120  lines of text can be displayed on a single frame.  Titles are centered horizontally unless you
       have changed the value of the internal parameter 'ICO'.  Vertical  spacing  is  automatically  determined
       using the current value of the internal parameter 'GSZ'.

       For  more  detailed control of titles, use the routine STITLE, which can be used to generate either fixed
       or scrolled titles.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant example: slex02.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use FTITLE or c_ftitle, load the NCAR Graphics  libraries  ncarg,  ncarg_gks,  ncarg_c,  and  ncarg_c,
       preferably in that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       See  the  scrolled_title  man  page  for  a  description  of  all  Scrolled_title  error  messages and/or
       informational messages.
