</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Scrolled_title - Creates movie titles. The titles can be scrolled, faded in, and/or faded out.
       Foreground and background colors can be specified.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       The package Scrolled_title has eight user entry points, as follows: FTITLE, STITLE, SLGETI, SLGETR,
       SLOGAP, SLSETI, SLSETR, and SLRSET.

       FTITLE      stands for "fixed titles" and is used when the following conditions are met:

                   •      Each group of text lines is to fit on one frame (no scrolling).

                   •      All test lines in a group are to be written in the same color.

                   •      Vertical spacing of text lines is to be done automatically.

                   •      Text lines are to be centered horizontally.

                   •      There are to be no more than 80 characters per text line (including Plotchar "function
                          codes").

                   •      In  production  mode,  blank frames are to be generated before and after each group of
                          title frames.

                   •      No more than 120 text lines are to be displayed on a single frame.

       STITLE      stands for "scrolled titles" and is used when the above conditions are not met.

       SLOGAP      is used to generate blank-frame gaps in a manner consistent with FTITLE.

       SLSETI and SLSETR
                   are used to set the values of "internal parameters"  whose  values  affect  the  behavior  of
                   FTITLE and/or STITLE.

       SLGETI and SLGETR
                   are used to retrieve the current values of internal parameters.

       SLRSET      is ued to reset the values of all internal parameters of STITLE to the original defaults.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use Scrolled_title routines, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, ncarg_c, and ncarg_c,
       preferably in that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       The error messages described can be written to the output unit by routines in the package Scrolled_title.
       Unless otherwise indicated, these errors are fatal and cause the user´s program to terminate execution.

            FTITLE - PREMATURE EOF ON CARD INPUT UNIT

                 FTITLE has encountered an end-of-file on the card input in a place where one  should  not  have
                 been.

            FTITLE - READ ERROR ON CARD INPUT UNIT

                 FTITLE has executed a FORTRAN READ statement and the "ERR=..." exit has been taken.

            FTITLE - TOO MANY INPUT CARDS IN GROUP

                 The first card of a title group contains a value of NCDS greater than 120.  FTITLE can't handle
                 that many lines.

            FTITLE - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR

                 When  FTITLE  was  called,  there  was  an unrecovered outstanding error.  The routine does not
                 continue; it forces the error message to be printed and then substitutes this one for it.

            SLBKGD - ERROR RETURN FROM GQFACI: i
            SLBKGD - ERROR RETURN FROM GQFAIS: I

                 A GKS routine has returned a non-zero error flag with value "i".  This most likely  means  that
                 GKS is in the wrong state.

            SLGCLR - TOO MANY COLORS DEFINED

                 More  than  256  colors  have  been  made known to STITLE.  It has no room in which to maintain
                 information about them all.

            SLGETI - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR

                 When SLGETI was called, there was an unrecovered  outstanding  error.   The  routine  does  not
                 continue; it forces the error message to be printed and then substitutes this one for it.

            SLGETR -- INVALID KEYWORD: xxx

                 The  first argument in a call to SLGETR is not the name of one of the known internal parameters
                 of STITLE.  This error message can occur as the result of a call to SLGETI.

            SLGETR - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR

                 When SLGETR was called, there was an unrecovered  outstanding  error.   The  routine  does  not
                 continue; it forces the error message to be printed and then substitutes this one for it.

            SLGWID - ERROR RETURN FROM GQACWK: i

                 A  GKS  routine has returned a non-zero error flag with value "i".  This most likely means that
                 GKS is in the wrong state.

            SLGWID - NO ACTIVE WORKSTATIONS

                 STITLE uses the routine SLGWID to determine the ID of the first active workstation (to  use  in
                 calls  dealing  with color) and it has found that there are currently no active workstations at
                 all.

            SLOGAP - ERROR RETURN FROM GQTXCI: i

                 A GKS routine has returned a non-zero error flag with value "i".  This most likely  means  that
                 GKS is in the wrong state.

            SLOGAP - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR

                 When  SLOGAP  was  called,  there  was  an unrecovered outstanding error.  The routine does not
                 continue; it forces the error message to be printed and then substitutes this one for it.

            SLRSET - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR

                 When SLOGAP was called, there was an unrecovered  outstanding  error.   The  routine  does  not
                 continue; it forces the error message to be printed and then substitutes this one for it.

            SLSCLR - TOO MANY COLORS DEFINED

                 More  than  256  colors  have  been  made known to STITLE.  It has no room in which to maintain
                 information about them all.

            SLSETI - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR

                 When SLSETI was called, there was an unrecovered  outstanding  error.   The  routine  does  not
                 continue; it forces the error message to be printed and then substitutes this one for it.

            SLSETR -- INVALID KEYWORD: xxx

                 The  first argument in a call to SLSETR is not the name of one of the known internal parameters
                 of STITLE.  This error message can occur as the result of a call to SLSETI.

            SLSETR - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR

                 When SLSETR was called, there was an unrecovered  outstanding  error.   The  routine  does  not
                 continue; it forces the error message to be printed and then substitutes this one for it.

            STITLE - ERROR RETURN FROM GQCLIP: i
            STITLE - ERROR RETURN FROM GQCNTN: i
            STITLE - ERROR RETURN FROM GQPLCI: i
            STITLE - ERROR RETURN FROM GQPMCI: i
            STITLE - ERROR RETURN FROM GQTXCI: i

                 A  GKS  routine has returned a non-zero error flag with value "i".  This most likely means that
                 GKS is in the wrong state.

            STITLE - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR

                 When STITLE was called, there was an unrecovered  outstanding  error.   The  routine  does  not
                 continue; it forces the error message to be printed and then substitutes this one for it.
