</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pthread_mutex_consistent — mark state protected by robust mutex as consistent

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</a>&gt;

       int pthread_mutex_consistent(pthread_mutex_t *<u>mutex</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If  <u>mutex</u> is a robust mutex in an inconsistent state, the <u>pthread_mutex_consistent</u>() function can be used
       to mark the state protected by the mutex referenced by <u>mutex</u> as consistent again.

       If an owner of a robust mutex terminates while holding the mutex, the mutex becomes inconsistent and  the
       next thread that acquires the mutex lock shall be notified of the state by the return value <b>[EOWNERDEAD]</b>.
       In this case, the mutex does not become normally usable again until the state is marked consistent.

       If  the thread which acquired the mutex lock with the return value <b>[EOWNERDEAD]</b> terminates before calling
       either <u>pthread_mutex_consistent</u>() or <u>pthread_mutex_unlock</u>(), the next thread that acquires the mutex lock
       shall be notified about the state of the mutex by the return value <b>[EOWNERDEAD]</b>.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <u>mutex</u> argument to <u>pthread_mutex_consistent</u>() does
       not refer to an initialized mutex.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <u>pthread_mutex_consistent</u>() function  shall  return  zero.  Otherwise,  an
       error value shall be returned to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pthread_mutex_consistent</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The mutex object referenced by <u>mutex</u> is not robust or does not protect an inconsistent state.

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>pthread_mutex_consistent</u>()  function  is  only responsible for notifying the implementation that the
       state protected by the mutex has been recovered and that normal operations with the mutex can be resumed.
       It is the responsibility of the application to recover the state so it can be reused. If the  application
       is not able to perform the recovery, it can notify the implementation that the situation is unrecoverable
       by  a  call  to  <u>pthread_mutex_unlock</u>() without a prior call to <u>pthread_mutex_consistent</u>(), in which case
       subsequent threads that attempt to lock the  mutex  will  fail  to  acquire  the  lock  and  be  returned
       <b>[ENOTRECOVERABLE]</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <u>mutex</u> argument to <u>pthread_mutex_consistent</u>()
       does  not  refer  to  an initialized mutex, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an
       <b>[EINVAL]</b> error.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
