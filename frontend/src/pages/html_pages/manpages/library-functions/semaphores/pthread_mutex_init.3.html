</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A mutex is a MUTual EXclusion device, and is useful for protecting shared data structures from concurrent
       modifications, and implementing critical sections and monitors.

       A mutex has two possible states: unlocked (not owned by any thread), and locked (owned by one thread).  A
       mutex can never be owned by two different threads simultaneously.  A thread attempting to  lock  a  mutex
       that is already locked by another thread is suspended until the owning thread unlocks the mutex first.

       <b>pthread_mutex_init</b>  initializes  the  mutex  object pointed to by <u>mutex</u> according to the mutex attributes
       specified in <u>mutexattr</u>.  If <u>mutexattr</u> is <b>NULL</b>, default attributes are used instead.

       The LinuxThreads implementation supports only one mutex attributes,  the  <u>mutex</u>  <u>kind</u>,  which  is  either
       ``fast'',  ``recursive'', or ``error checking''.  The kind of a mutex determines whether it can be locked
       again by a thread that already owns it.  The default kind is ``fast''.  See <b><a href="../man3/pthread_mutexattr_init.3.html">pthread_mutexattr_init</a></b>(3) for
       more information on mutex attributes.

       Variables  of  type  <b>pthread_mutex_t</b>  can  also  be   initialized   statically,   using   the   constants
       <b>PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER</b>  (for  fast  mutexes),  <b>PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER_NP</b>  (for  recursive
       mutexes), and <b>PTHREAD_ERRORCHECK_MUTEX_INITIALIZER_NP</b> (for error checking mutexes).

       <b>pthread_mutex_lock</b> locks the given mutex.  If the mutex is currently  unlocked,  it  becomes  locked  and
       owned  by the calling thread, and <b>pthread_mutex_lock</b> returns immediately.  If the mutex is already locked
       by another thread, <b>pthread_mutex_lock</b> suspends the calling thread until the mutex is unlocked.

       If the mutex is already locked by the calling thread, the behavior of <b>pthread_mutex_lock</b> depends  on  the
       kind of the mutex.  If the mutex is of the ``fast'' kind, the calling thread is suspended until the mutex
       is  unlocked,  thus  effectively  causing the calling thread to deadlock.  If the mutex is of the ``error
       checking'' kind, <b>pthread_mutex_lock</b> returns immediately with the error code <b>EDEADLK</b>.  If the mutex is  of
       the  ``recursive''  kind,  <b>pthread_mutex_lock</b>  succeeds  and returns immediately, recording the number of
       times the calling thread has locked the mutex.  An equal number of <b>pthread_mutex_unlock</b>  operations  must
       be performed before the mutex returns to the unlocked state.

       <b>pthread_mutex_trylock</b>  behaves  identically  to  <b>pthread_mutex_lock</b>,  except  that  it does not block the
       calling thread if the mutex is already locked by another thread (or by the calling thread in the case  of
       a ``fast'' mutex).  Instead, <b>pthread_mutex_trylock</b> returns immediately with the error code <b>EBUSY</b>.

       <b>pthread_mutex_unlock</b> unlocks the given mutex.  The mutex is assumed to be locked and owned by the calling
       thread  on  entrance to <b>pthread_mutex_unlock</b>.  If the mutex is of the ``fast'' kind, <b>pthread_mutex_unlock</b>
       always returns it to the unlocked state.  If it is of the ``recursive'' kind, it decrements  the  locking
       count  of  the mutex (number of <b>pthread_mutex_lock</b> operations performed on it by the calling thread), and
       only when this count reaches zero is the mutex actually unlocked.

       On ``error checking'' and ``recursive'' mutexes, <b>pthread_mutex_unlock</b> actually checks  at  run-time  that
       the  mutex  is  locked  on  entrance,  and  that  it  was  locked  by the same thread that is now calling
       <b>pthread_mutex_unlock</b>.  If these conditions are not met, an error code is returned and the  mutex  remains
       unchanged.   ``Fast''  mutexes  perform  no such checks, thus allowing a locked mutex to be unlocked by a
       thread other than its owner.  This is non-portable behavior and must not be relied upon.

       <b>pthread_mutex_destroy</b> destroys a mutex object, freeing the resources it might hold.  The  mutex  must  be
       unlocked  on  entrance.   In  the  LinuxThreads  implementation,  no  resources are associated with mutex
       objects, thus <b>pthread_mutex_destroy</b> actually does nothing except checking that the mutex is unlocked.

</pre><h4><b>CANCELLATION</b></h4><pre>
       None of the mutex functions is a cancelation point, not even <b>pthread_mutex_lock</b>, in  spite  of  the  fact
       that  it  can  suspend  a thread for arbitrary durations.  This way, the status of mutexes at cancelation
       points is predictable, allowing cancelation handlers to unlock precisely those mutexes that  need  to  be
       unlocked  before  the  thread  stops  executing.  Consequently, threads using deferred cancelation should
       never hold a mutex for extended periods of time.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNC-SIGNAL</b> <b>SAFETY</b></h4><pre>
       The mutex functions are not async-signal safe.  What this means is that they should not be called from  a
       signal  handler.  In particular, calling <b>pthread_mutex_lock</b> or <b>pthread_mutex_unlock</b> from a signal handler
       may deadlock the calling thread.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pthread_mutex_init</b> always returns 0.  The other mutex functions return 0 on success and a non-zero  error
       code on error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>pthread_mutex_lock</b> function returns the following error code on error:

              <b>EINVAL</b> The mutex has not been properly initialized.

              <b>EDEADLK</b>
                     The mutex is already locked by the calling thread (``error checking'' mutexes only).

       The <b>pthread_mutex_trylock</b> function returns the following error codes on error:

              <b>EBUSY</b>  The mutex could not be acquired because it was currently locked.

              <b>EINVAL</b> The mutex has not been properly initialized.

       The <b>pthread_mutex_unlock</b> function returns the following error code on error:

              <b>EINVAL</b> The mutex has not been properly initialized.

              <b>EPERM</b>  The calling thread does not own the mutex (``error checking'' mutexes only).

       The <b>pthread_mutex_destroy</b> function returns the following error code on error:

              <b>EBUSY</b>  The mutex is currently locked.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       A shared global variable <u>x</u> can be protected by a mutex as follows:

              <b>int</b> <b>x;</b>
              <b>pthread_mutex_t</b> <b>mut</b> <b>=</b> <b>PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;</b>

       All   accesses   and  modifications  to  <u>x</u>  should  be  bracketed  by  calls  to  <b>pthread_mutex_lock</b>  and
       <b>pthread_mutex_unlock</b> as follows:

              <b>pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;mut);</b>
              <b>/*</b> <b>operate</b> <b>on</b> <b>x</b> <b>*/</b>
              <b>pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;mut);</b>
