</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pthread_mutex_timedlock — lock a mutex

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</a>&gt;
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/time.h">time.h</a>&gt;

       int pthread_mutex_timedlock(pthread_mutex_t *restrict <u>mutex</u>,
           const struct timespec *restrict <u>abstime</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>pthread_mutex_timedlock</u>() function shall lock the mutex object referenced by <u>mutex</u>.  If the mutex is
       already  locked,  the  calling  thread  shall  block  until  the  mutex  becomes  available  as  in   the
       <u>pthread_mutex_lock</u>() function. If the mutex cannot be locked without waiting for another thread to unlock
       the mutex, this wait shall be terminated when the specified timeout expires.

       The  timeout shall expire when the absolute time specified by <u>abstime</u> passes, as measured by the clock on
       which timeouts are based (that is, when the value of that clock equals or exceeds  <u>abstime</u>),  or  if  the
       absolute time specified by <u>abstime</u> has already been passed at the time of the call.

       The  timeout  shall  be  based  on  the CLOCK_REALTIME clock.  The resolution of the timeout shall be the
       resolution of the clock on which it is based. The <b>timespec</b> data type is defined in the <u>&lt;time.h&gt;</u> header.

       Under no circumstance shall the function fail with a timeout if the mutex can be locked immediately.  The
       validity of the <u>abstime</u> parameter need not be checked if the mutex can be locked immediately.

       As  a  consequence  of  the  priority  inheritance  rules  (for mutexes initialized with the PRIO_INHERIT
       protocol), if a timed mutex wait is terminated because its timeout expires, the priority of the owner  of
       the  mutex  shall  be  adjusted  as necessary to reflect the fact that this thread is no longer among the
       threads waiting for the mutex.

       If <u>mutex</u> is a robust mutex and the process containing the owning  thread  terminated  while  holding  the
       mutex lock, a call to <u>pthread_mutex_timedlock</u>() shall return the error value <b>[EOWNERDEAD]</b>.  If <u>mutex</u> is a
       robust   mutex   and   the   owning   thread   terminated  while  holding  the  mutex  lock,  a  call  to
       <u>pthread_mutex_timedlock</u>() may return the error value <b>[EOWNERDEAD]</b> even if the process in which the owning
       thread resides has not terminated. In these cases, the mutex is locked by the thread  but  the  state  it
       protects  is  marked as inconsistent. The application should ensure that the state is made consistent for
       reuse and when that is complete call <u>pthread_mutex_consistent</u>().  If the application is unable to recover
       the state, it should unlock the mutex without a prior call to <u>pthread_mutex_consistent</u>(), after which the
       mutex is marked permanently unusable.

       If <u>mutex</u> does not refer to an initialized mutex object, the behavior is undefined.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       If successful, the <u>pthread_mutex_timedlock</u>() function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall
       be returned to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pthread_mutex_timedlock</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> The mutex could not be acquired because the maximum number of recursive locks for <u>mutex</u>  has  been
              exceeded.

       <b>EDEADLK</b>
              The mutex type is PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK and the current thread already owns the mutex.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The  mutex  was  created with the protocol attribute having the value PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT and the
              calling thread's priority is higher than the mutex' current priority ceiling.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The process or thread would have blocked, and the <u>abstime</u> parameter specified a nanoseconds  field
              value less than zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million.

       <b>ENOTRECOVERABLE</b>
              The state protected by the mutex is not recoverable.

       <b>EOWNERDEAD</b>
              The mutex is a robust mutex and the process containing the previous owning thread terminated while
              holding the mutex lock. The mutex lock shall be acquired by the calling thread and it is up to the
              new owner to make the state consistent.

       <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>
              The mutex could not be locked before the specified timeout expired.

       The <u>pthread_mutex_timedlock</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EDEADLK</b>
              A deadlock condition was detected.

       <b>EOWNERDEAD</b>
              The  mutex  is  a  robust  mutex and the previous owning thread terminated while holding the mutex
              lock. The mutex lock shall be acquired by the calling thread and it is up to the new owner to make
              the state consistent.

       This function shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Applications that have assumed that non-zero return values are errors will need  updating  for  use  with
       robust  mutexes,  since  a  valid  return  for a thread acquiring a mutex which is protecting a currently
       inconsistent state is <b>[EOWNERDEAD]</b>.  Applications that do not check the error returns, due to ruling  out
       the  possibility  of such errors arising, should not use robust mutexes. If an application is supposed to
       work with normal and robust mutexes, it should check all  return  values  for  error  conditions  and  if
       necessary take appropriate action.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Refer to <u>pthread_mutex_lock</u>().

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
