</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       al_rumble_haptic - Allegro 5 API

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
              #include &lt;allegro5/allegro.h&gt;

              bool al_rumble_haptic(ALLEGRO_HAPTIC *hap,
                 double intensity, double duration, ALLEGRO_HAPTIC_EFFECT_ID *id)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Uploads  a  simple  rumble  effect  to  the haptic device and starts playback immediately.  The parameter
       intensity is a relative magnitude between 0.0 and 1.0 that determines the intensity of the rumble effect.
       The duration determines the duration of the effect in seconds.

       You must also pass in a pointer to a user allocated <a href="../man3alleg5/ALLEGRO_HAPTIC_EFFECT_ID.3alleg5.html">ALLEGRO_HAPTIC_EFFECT_ID</a>(3alleg5).  It it is stored a
       reference to be used to control  playback  of  the  effect.   Returns  true  if  the  rumble  effect  was
       successfully uploaded and started, false if not.

       In   case   false   is   returned,   the   rumble   effect   will   be   automatically   released  as  if
       <a href="../man3alleg5/al_release_haptic_effect.3alleg5.html">al_release_haptic_effect</a>(3alleg5) had been called, so there is no need to call it again manually in  this
       case.   However,  if true is returned, it is necessary to call <a href="../man3alleg5/al_release_haptic_effect.3alleg5.html">al_release_haptic_effect</a>(3alleg5) when the
       effect isnâ€™t needed anymore, to prevent the amount of available effects on the haptic device from running
       out.

</pre><h4><b>SINCE</b></h4><pre>
       5.1.8

              <u>[Unstable</u> <u>API]:</u> Perhaps could be simplified due to limited support for all  the  exposed  features
              across all of the platforms.  Awaiting feedback from users.
