       SAMPLE - Stores sound data. Allegro game programming library.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;allegro.h&gt;</b>

       <b>typedef</b> <b>struct</b> <b>SAMPLE</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
          int bits;                   - 8 or 16
          int stereo;                 - sample type flag
          int freq;                   - sample frequency
          int priority;               - 0-255
          unsigned long len;          - length (in samples)
          unsigned long loop_start;   - loop start position
          unsigned long loop_end;     - loop finish position
          void *data;                 - raw sample data

       A  sample structure, which holds sound data, used by the digital sample routines. You can consider all of
       these fields as read only except priority, loop_start and loop_end, which you can change them for example
       after loading a sample from disk.

       The priority is a value from 0 to 255 (by default set to 128) and controls how  hardware  voices  on  the
       sound  card  are  allocated  if  you attempt to play more than the driver can handle. This may be used to
       ensure that the less important sounds are cut off while the important ones are preserved.

       The variables loop_start and loop_end specify the loop position in sample units, and are set  by  default
       to the start and end of the sample.

       If you are creating your own samples on the fly, you might also want to modify the raw data of the sample
       pointed  by  the  data  field.  The sample data are always in unsigned format. This means that if you are
       loading a PCM encoded sound file with signed 16-bit samples, you would have to XOR every two bytes  (i.e.
       every sample value) with 0x8000 to change the signedness.
