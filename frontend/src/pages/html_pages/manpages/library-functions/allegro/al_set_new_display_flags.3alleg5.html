       al_set_new_display_flags - Allegro 5 API

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
              #include &lt;allegro5/allegro.h&gt;

              void al_set_new_display_flags(int flags)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sets  various  flags  to  be  used when creating new displays on the calling thread.  flags is a bitfield
       containing any reasonable combination of the following:

       ALLEGRO_WINDOWED
              Prefer a windowed mode.

              Under multi-head X (not XRandR/TwinView), the use of more than one adapter is  impossible  due  to
              bugs  in X and GLX.  <a href="../man3alleg5/al_create_display.3alleg5.html">al_create_display</a>(3alleg5) will fail if more than one adapter is attempted to
              be used.

       ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN_WINDOW
              Make the window span the entire screen.  Unlike ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN  this  will  never  attempt  to
              modify  the  screen  resolution.   Instead the pixel dimensions of the created display will be the
              same as the desktop.

              The passed width and height are only used if the window is switched out of fullscreen  mode  later
              but will be ignored initially.

              Under Windows and X11 a fullscreen display created with this flag will behave differently from one
              created  with  the  ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN flag - even if the ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN display is passed the
              desktop dimensions.  The exact difference is platform dependent, but  some  things  which  may  be
              different  is  how  alt-tab works, how fast you can toggle between fullscreen/windowed mode or how
              additional monitors behave while your display is in fullscreen mode.

              Additionally under X, the use of more than one adapter in multi-head mode or  with  true  Xinerama
              enabled  is  impossible  due  to  bugs  in  X/GLX,  creation will fail if more than one adapter is
              attempted to be used.

       ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN
              Prefer a fullscreen mode.

              Under X the use of more than one FULLSCREEN display when using multi-head X, or true  Xinerama  is
              not  possible  due  to  bugs  in X and GLX, display creation will fail if more than one adapter is
              attempted to be used.

                     <u>Note:</u> Prefer using  ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN_WINDOW  as  it  typically  provides  a  better  user
                     experience  as  the monitor doesnâ€™t change resolution and switching away from your game via
                     Alt-Tab works smoothly.  ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN is typically less well  supported  compared  to
                     ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN_WINDOW.

       ALLEGRO_RESIZABLE
              The display is resizable (only applicable if combined with ALLEGRO_WINDOWED).

       ALLEGRO_MAXIMIZED
              The display window will be maximized (only applicable if combined with ALLEGRO_RESIZABLE).  Since:
              5.1.12

       ALLEGRO_OPENGL
              Require the driver to provide an initialized OpenGL context after returning successfully.

       ALLEGRO_OPENGL_3_0
              Require the driver to provide an initialized OpenGL context compatible with OpenGL version 3.0.

       ALLEGRO_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPATIBLE
              If this flag is set, the OpenGL context created with ALLEGRO_OPENGL_3_0 will be forward compatible
              <u>only</u>,  meaning that all of the OpenGL API declared deprecated in OpenGL 3.0 will not be supported.
              Currently, a display created with this flag will <u>not</u> be compatible with Allegro drawing  routines;
              the display option ALLEGRO_COMPATIBLE_DISPLAY will be set to false.

       ALLEGRO_OPENGL_ES_PROFILE
              Used together with ALLEGRO_OPENGL, requests that the OpenGL context uses the OpenGL ES profile.  A
              specific  version  can be requested with <a href="../man3alleg5/al_set_new_display_option.3alleg5.html">al_set_new_display_option</a>(3alleg5).  Note: Currently this
              is only supported by the X11/GLX driver.  Since: 5.1.13

       ALLEGRO_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE
              Used together with ALLEGRO_OPENGL, requests that the OpenGL context uses the OpenGL Core  profile.
              A specific version can be requested with <a href="../man3alleg5/al_set_new_display_option.3alleg5.html">al_set_new_display_option</a>(3alleg5).  Note: Currently this
              is only supported by the X11/GLX driver.  Since: 5.2.7

       ALLEGRO_DIRECT3D
              Require the driver to do rendering with Direct3D and provide a Direct3D device.

       ALLEGRO_PROGRAMMABLE_PIPELINE
              Require  a  programmable  graphics pipeline.  This flag is required to use <a href="../man3alleg5/ALLEGRO_SHADER.3alleg5.html">ALLEGRO_SHADER</a>(3alleg5)
              objects.  Since: 5.1.6

       ALLEGRO_FRAMELESS
              Try to create a window without a frame (i.e. no border or titlebar).  This  usually  does  nothing
              for  fullscreen modes, and even in windowed modes it depends on the underlying platform whether it
              is supported or not.  Since: 5.0.7, 5.1.2

       ALLEGRO_NOFRAME
              Original name for ALLEGRO_FRAMELESS.  This works with older versions of Allegro.

       ALLEGRO_GENERATE_EXPOSE_EVENTS
              Let the display generate expose events.

       ALLEGRO_GTK_TOPLEVEL
              Create a GTK toplevel window for the display, on X. This flag  is  conditionally  defined  by  the
              native  dialog  addon.   You  must  call  <a href="../man3alleg5/al_init_native_dialog_addon.3alleg5.html">al_init_native_dialog_addon</a>(3alleg5)  for it to succeed.
              ALLEGRO_GTK_TOPLEVEL is incompatible with ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN.  Since: 5.1.5

       ALLEGRO_DRAG_AND_DROP
              If a display is created with the ALLEGRO_DRAG_AND_DROP flag it  will  generate  ALLEGRO_EVENT_DROP
              events when files or text are dropped over the display.

                     <u>[Unstable</u>  <u>API]:</u>  This  is  an  experimental  feature  and currently only works for the X11
                     backend.

              Since: 5.2.9

       0 can be used for default values.
