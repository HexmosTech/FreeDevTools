       al_fixed - Allegro 5 API

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
              #include &lt;allegro5/allegro.h&gt;

              typedef int32_t al_fixed;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A fixed point number.

       Allegro  provides some routines for working with fixed point numbers, and defines the type al_fixed to be
       a signed 32-bit integer.  The high word is used for the integer part and the low word for  the  fraction,
       giving  a  range  of  -32768  to 32767 and an accuracy of about four or five decimal places.  Fixed point
       numbers can be assigned, compared, added, subtracted, negated and shifted (for multiplying or dividing by
       powers of two) using the normal integer operators, but you  should  take  care  to  use  the  appropriate
       conversion routines when mixing fixed point with integer or floating point values.  Writing fixed_point_1
       + fixed_point_2 is OK, but fixed_point + integer is not.

       The only advantage of fixed point math routines is that you donâ€™t require a floating point coprocessor to
       use  them.  This was great in the time period of i386 and i486 machines, but stopped being so useful with
       the coming of the Pentium class of processors.  From Pentium onwards, CPUs have increased their  strength
       in  floating  point  operations,  equaling  or  even  surpassing integer math performance.  However, many
       embedded processors have no FPUs so fixed point maths can still be useful there.

       Depending on the type of operations your program may need, using floating point types may be faster  than
       fixed types if you are targeting a specific machine class.
