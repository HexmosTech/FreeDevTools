</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       al_get_standard_path - Allegro 5 API

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
              #include &lt;allegro5/allegro.h&gt;

              ALLEGRO_PATH *al_get_standard_path(int id)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Gets  a  system  path,  depending  on  the  id  parameter.   Some  of  these paths may be affected by the
       organization and application name, so be sure to set those before calling this function.

       The paths are not guaranteed to be unique (e.g., SETTINGS and DATA may be the same on some platforms), so
       you should be sure your filenames are unique if you need to avoid naming collisions.   Also,  a  returned
       path may not actually exist on the file system.

       ALLEGRO_RESOURCES_PATH
              If  you  bundle  data  in a location relative to your executable, then you should use this path to
              locate that data.  On most platforms, this is the directory that contains the executable file.

              If called from an OS X app bundle, then  this  will  point  to  the  internal  resource  directory
              (&lt;bundle.app&gt;/Contents/Resources).   To  maintain  consistency,  if  you put your resources into a
              directory called “data” beneath the executable on some other platform  (like  Windows),  then  you
              should also create a directory called “data” under the OS X app bundle’s resource folder.

              You should not try to write to this path, as it is very likely read-only.

              If   you  install  your  resources  in  some  other  system  directory  (e.g.,  in  <a href="file:/usr/share">/usr/share</a>  or
              C:\ProgramData), then you are responsible for keeping track of that yourself.

       ALLEGRO_TEMP_PATH
              Path to the directory for temporary files.

       ALLEGRO_USER_HOME_PATH
              This is the user’s home directory.  You should  not  normally  write  files  into  this  directory
              directly,  or  create  any  sub  folders  in  it,  without explicit permission from the user.  One
              practical application of this path would be to use it as the starting place of a file selector  in
              a GUI.

       ALLEGRO_USER_DOCUMENTS_PATH
              This location is easily accessible by the user, and is the place to store documents and files that
              the user might want to later open with an external program or transfer to another place.

              You should not save files here unless the user expects it, usually by explicit permission.

       ALLEGRO_USER_DATA_PATH
              If  your  program  saves any data that the user doesn’t need to access externally, then you should
              place it here.  This is generally the least intrusive place to store data.  This path will usually
              not be present on the file system, so make sure to create it before writing to it.

       ALLEGRO_USER_SETTINGS_PATH
              If you are saving configuration files (especially if the user may want to  edit  them  outside  of
              your program), then you should place them here.  This path will usually not be present on the file
              system, so make sure to create it before writing to it.

       ALLEGRO_EXENAME_PATH
              The full path to the executable.

       Returns NULL on failure.  The returned path should be freed with <a href="../man3alleg5/al_destroy_path.3alleg5.html">al_destroy_path</a>(3alleg5).
