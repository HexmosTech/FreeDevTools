       file_select_ex - Displays the Allegro file selector with a caption.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;allegro.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>file_select_ex(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*message,</b> <b>char</b> <b>*path,</b> <b>const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*ext,</b> <b>int</b> <b>size,</b> <b>int</b> <b>w,</b> <b>int</b> <b>h);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Displays  the Allegro file selector, with the message as caption. The path parameter contains the initial
       filename to display (this can be used to set the starting directory, or to provide a default filename for
       a save-as operation). The user selection is returned by altering the path buffer, whose maximum  capacity
       in  bytes  is  specified by the size parameter.  Note that it should have room for at least 80 characters
       (not bytes), so you should reserve 6x that amount, just to  be  sure.  The  list  of  files  is  filtered
       according  to  the  file  extensions  in  the  ext parameter.  Passing NULL includes all files; "PCX;BMP"
       includes only files with `.PCX' or `.BMP' extensions. If you wish to control files by  their  attributes,
       one  of  the  fields  in  the  extension  list  can  begin  with  a slash, followed by a set of attribute
       characters. Any attribute written on its own, or with a '+' before it, indicates to  include  only  files
       which  have  that attribute set. Any attribute with a '-' before it indicates to leave out any files with
       that attribute. The flag characters are `r' (read-only), `h' (hidden), `s' (system), `d' (directory)  and
       `a'  (archive).  For  example,  an extension string of "PCX;BMP;/+r-h" will display only PCX or BMP files
       that are read-only and not hidden. The directories are not affected in the same way as the other files by
       the extension string: the extensions are never taken into account for them and the other  attributes  are
       taken into account only when 'd' is mentioned in the string; in other words, all directories are included
       when 'd' is not mentioned in the string. The file selector is stretched to the width and height specified
       in  the  w and h parameters, and to the size of the standard Allegro font.  If either the width or height
       argument is set to zero, it is stretched to the corresponding screen  dimension.  This  function  returns
       zero if it was closed with the Cancel button or non-zero if it was OK'd.
