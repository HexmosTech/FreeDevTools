       set_volume_per_voice - Sets the volume of a voice. Allegro game programming library.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;allegro.h&gt;</b>

       <b>void</b> <b>set_volume_per_voice(int</b> <b>scale);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       By  default,  Allegro  will  play  a centered sample at half volume on both the left and right channel. A
       sample panned to the far right or left will be played at maximum volume on that  channel  only.  This  is
       done  so  you  can  play  a single panned sample without distortion. If you play multiple samples at full
       volume, the mixing process can result in clipping, a noticeable form of distortion. The more samples, the
       more likely clipping is to occur, and the more clipping, the worse the output will sound.

       If clipping is a problem - or if the output is too quiet - this function can be used to adjust the volume
       of each voice. You should first check that your speakers are at a  reasonable  volume,  Allegro's  global
       volume  is  at  maximum (see set_volume() below), and any other mixers such as the Windows Volume Control
       are set reasonably. Once you are sure that Allegro's output level is unsuitable for your application, use
       this function to adjust it.

       Each time you increase the parameter by one, the volume of each voice will halve.  For  example,  if  you
       pass 4, you can play up to 16 centred samples at maximum volume without distortion.

       If  you  pass  0  to  this function, each centred sample will play at the maximum volume possible without
       distortion, as will all samples played through a mono driver. Samples at the extreme left and right  will
       distort  if  played at full volume. If you wish to play panned samples at full volume without distortion,
       you should pass 1 to this function.  Note: this is  different  from  the  function's  behaviour  in  WIPs
       3.9.34,  3.9.35  and 3.9.36. If you used this function under one of these WIPs, you will have to increase
       your parameter by one to get the same volume.

       Note: The default behaviour has changed as of Allegro 4.1.15. If you would like the behaviour of  earlier
       versions  of  Allegro,  pass  -1 to this function. Allegro will choose a value dependent on the number of
       voices, so that if you reserve n voices, you can play up to n/2 normalised samples  with  centre  panning
       without  risking distortion. The exception is when you have fewer than 8 voices, where the volume remains
       the same as for 8 voices. Here are the values, dependent on the number of voices:

          1-8 voices - <a href="../man2/set_volume_per_voice.2.html">set_volume_per_voice</a>(2)
           16 voices - <a href="../man3/set_volume_per_voice.3.html">set_volume_per_voice</a>(3)
           32 voices - <a href="../man4/set_volume_per_voice.4.html">set_volume_per_voice</a>(4)
           64 voices - <a href="../man5/set_volume_per_voice.5.html">set_volume_per_voice</a>(5)

       Of  course  this  function  does  not  override  the   volume   you   specify   with   play_sample()   or
       voice_set_volume().  It  simply  alters  the  overall output of the program. If you play samples at lower
       volumes, or if they are not normalised, then you can play more of them without distortion.

       It is recommended that you hard-code the parameter into your program, rather  than  offering  it  to  the
       user. The user can alter the volume with the configuration file instead, or you can provide for this with
       set_volume().

       To restore volume per voice to its default behaviour, pass 1.
