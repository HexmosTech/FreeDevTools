</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       sqitch-engine - Manage database engine configuration

</pre><h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4><pre>
         sqitch engine
         sqitch engine [-v | --verbose]
         sqitch engine add &lt;name&gt; [engine-options]
         sqitch engine alter &lt;name&gt; [engine-options]
         sqitch engine remove &lt;name&gt;
         sqitch engine show &lt;name&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Manage the database engines you deploy to. The list of supported engines includes:

       •   "firebird"

       •   "mysql"

       •   "oracle"

       •   "pg"

       •   "sqlite"

       •   "vertica"

       •   "exasol"

       •   "snowflake"

       Each engine may have a number of properties:

       "target"
           The  name  or URI of the database target. Note that if the value is a URI, the engine in the URI must
           match the engine being added or altered. The default is "db:$engine". See sqitch-target  for  details
           on target configuration.

       "registry"
           The name of the registry schema or database. The default is "sqitch".

       "client"
           The command-line client to use. If not specified, each engine looks in the OS Path for an appropriate
           client.

       "top_dir"
           The  path  to  the  top directory for the engine. This directory generally contains the plan file and
           subdirectories for deploy, revert, and verify  scripts,  as  well  as  reworked  instances  of  those
           scripts. The default is <u>.</u>, the current directory.

       "plan_file"
           The plan file to use for this engine. The default is "$top_dir/sqitch.plan".

       "deploy_dir"
           The  path  to  the deploy directory for the engine. This directory contains all of the deploy scripts
           referenced by changes in the "plan_file". The default is "$top_dir/deploy".

       "revert_dir"
           The path to the revert directory for the engine. This directory contains all of  the  revert  scripts
           referenced by changes in the "plan_file". The default is "$top_dir/revert".

       "verify_dir"
           The  path  to  the verify directory for the engine. This directory contains all of the verify scripts
           referenced by changes in the "plan_file". The default is "$top_dir/verify".

       "reworked_dir"
           The path to the reworked directory for the engine. This directory contains all subdirectories for all
           reworked scripts referenced by changes in the "plan_file". The default is $top_dir.

       "reworked_deploy_dir"
           The path to the reworked deploy directory for the engine. This directory contains all of the reworked
           deploy scripts referenced by changes in the "plan_file". The default is "$reworked_dir/deploy".

       "reworked_revert_dir"
           The path to the reworked revert directory for the engine. This directory contains all of the reworked
           revert scripts referenced by changes in the "plan_file". The default is "$reworked_dir/revert".

       "reworked_verify_dir"
           The path to the reworked verify directory for the engine. This directory contains all of the reworked
           verify scripts referenced by changes in the "plan_file". The default is "$reworked_dir/verify".

       "extension"
           The file name extension to append to change names to create script file names.  The default is "sql".

       Each of these  overrides  the  corresponding  core  configuration  --  for  example,  the  "core.target",
       "core.plan_file", "core.registry", and "core.client" config options.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       List Option
           "-v"
           "--verbose"
                 sqitch engine --verbose

               Be more verbose when listing engines.

       Add and Alter Options
           "--top-dir"
                 sqitch engine add pg --top-dir sql

               Specifies  the  top  directory to use for the engine. Typically contains the deployment plan file
               and the change script directories.

           "--plan-file"
           "-f"
                 sqitch engine add pg --plan-file my.plan

               Specifies the path to the deployment plan file. Defaults to "$top_dir/sqitch.plan".

                 sqitch engine add pg --extension ddl

               Specifies the file name extension to use for change script file names.  Defaults to "sql".

           "--dir"
                 sqitch engine add pg --dir deploy=dep --dir revert=rev --dir verify=tst

               Sets the path to a script directory. May be specified multiple times.  Supported keys are:

               •   "deploy"

               •   "revert"

               •   "verify"

               Specifies the name or URI &lt;https://github.com/libwww-perl/uri-db/&gt; of the target database for the
               engine.

           "--registry"
                 sqitch engine add pg --registry meta

               Specifies the name of the database object where  Sqitch's  state  and  history  data  is  stored.
               Typically  a  schema  name  (as  in  PostgreSQL  and Oracle) or a database name (as in SQLite and
               MySQL). Defaults to "sqitch".

           "--client"
                 sqitch engine add pg --client /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql

               Specifies the path to the command-line client for the engine. Defaults to a client in the current
               path named appropriately for the engine.

           "-s"
           "--set"
               Set a variable name and value for use by the database engine client, if  it  supports  variables.
               The format must be "name=value", e.g., "--set defuser='Homer Simpson'".

</pre><h4><b>Actions</b></h4><pre>
       With  no arguments, shows a list of existing engines. Several actions are available to perform operations
       on the engines.

   <b>"add"</b>
       Add an engine named "&lt;name&gt;" for the database at "&lt;uri&gt;". The "--set"  option  specifies  engine-specific
       properties.  A  new  plan  file  and  new script script directories will be created if they don't already
       exist.

   <b>"alter"</b>
       Alter an engine named "&lt;name&gt;". The "--set" option  specifies  engine-specific  properties  to  set.  New
       script script directories will be created if they don't already exist.

   <b>"remove",</b> <b>"rm"</b>
       Remove the engine named "&lt;name&gt;" from the configuration. The plan file and script directories will not be
       affected.

   <b>"show"</b>
       Gives  some  information about the engine "&lt;name&gt;", including the associated properties. Specify multiple
       engine names to see information for each.

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>Variables</b></h4><pre>
       The engines are stored in the  configuration  file,  but  the  command  itself  currently  relies  on  no
       configuration variables.

</pre><h4><b>Sqitch</b></h4><pre>
       Part of the sqitch suite.
