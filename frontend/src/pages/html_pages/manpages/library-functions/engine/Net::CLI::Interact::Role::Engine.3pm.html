</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::CLI::Interact::Role::Engine - Statement execution engine

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is the core of Net::CLI::Interact, and serves to take entries from your loaded Phrasebooks,
       issue them to connected devices, and gather the returned output.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>cmd(</b> <b>$command_statement,</b> <b>\%options?</b> <b>)</b>
       Execute a single command statement on the connected device, and consume output until there is a match
       with the current <u>prompt</u>. The statement is executed verbatim on the device, with a newline appended.

       The following options are supported:

       "timeout =&gt; $seconds" (optional)
           Sets  a  value of "timeout" for the Transport local to this call of "cmd", that overrides whatever is
           set in the Transport, or the default of 10 seconds.

       "no_ors =&gt; 1" (optional)
           When passed a true value, a newline character (in fact the value of "ors") will not  be  appended  to
           the statement sent to the device.

       "match =&gt; $name | $regexpref | \@names_and_regexprefs" (optional)
           Allows  this  command (only) to complete with a custom match, which must be one or more of either the
           name of a loaded phrasebook Prompt or your own regular  expression  reference  ("qr//").  The  module
           updates the current prompt to be the same value on a successful match.

       In  scalar  context the "last_response" is returned (see below). In list context the gathered response is
       returned as a list of lines. In both cases your local platform's newline character will end all lines.

   <b>macro(</b> <b>$macro_name,</b> <b>\%options?</b> <b>)</b>
       Execute the commands contained within the named Macro, which must be loaded from a Phrasebook. Options to
       control the output, including variables for substitution into the Macro, are passed in the %options  hash
       reference.

       The following options are supported:

       "params =&gt; \@values" (optional)
           If  the  Macro  contains  commands using "sprintf" Format variables then the corresponding parameters
           must be passed in this value as an array reference.

           Values are consumed from the provided array reference and passed to the "send" commands in the  Macro
           in order, as needed. An exception will be thrown if there are insufficient parameters.

       "timeout =&gt; $seconds" (optional)
           Sets a value of "timeout" for the Transport local to this call of "macro", that overrides whatever is
           set in the Transport, or the default of 10 seconds.

       An  exception  will  be thrown if the Match statements in the Macro are not successful against the output
       returned from the device. This is based on the value of "timeout", which controls  how  long  the  module
       waits for matching output.

       In  scalar  context the "last_response" is returned (see below). In list context the gathered response is
       returned as a list of lines. In both cases your local platform's newline character will end all lines.

   <b>last_response</b>
       Returns the gathered output after issuing the last recent "send" command within the most recent "cmd"  or
       "prompt". That is, you get the output from the last command sent to the connected device.

       In  scalar  context  all data is returned. In list context the gathered response is returned as a list of
       lines. In both cases your local platform's newline character will end all lines.

   <b>last_actionset</b>
       Returns the complete ActionSet that was constructed from the most recent "macro" or "cmd" execution. This
       will be a sequence of Actions that correspond to "send" and "match" statements.

       In the case of a Macro these directly relate to the  contents  of  your  Phrasebook,  with  the  possible
       addition  of  "match"  statements  added  automatically. In the case of a "cmd" execution, an "anonymous"
       Macro is constructed which consists of a single "send" and a single "match".
