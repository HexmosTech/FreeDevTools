</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       minput_get_command -

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>MPlist</b>* <b>minput_get_command</b> (MSymbol <u>language</u>, MSymbol <u>name</u>, MSymbol <u>command</u>)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       @brief Get information about input method command(s).

       The minput_get_command() function returns information about
       the command @b command of the input method specified by @b language and
       @b name.  An input method command is a pseudo key event to which one
       or more actual input key sequences are assigned.

       There are two kinds of commands, global and local.  A global
       command has a global definition, and the description and the key
       assignment may be inherited by a local command.  Each input method
       defines a local command which has a local key assignment.  It may
       also declare a local command that inherits the definition of a
       global command of the same name.

       If @b language is #Mt and @b name is #Mnil, this function returns
       information about a global command.  Otherwise information about a
       local command is returned.

       If @b command is #Mnil, information about all commands is returned.

       The return value is a @e well-formed plist (@ref m17nPlist) of this
       format:

         ((NAME DESCRIPTION STATUS [KEYSEQ ...]) ...)

       NAME is a symbol representing the command name.

       DESCRIPTION is an M-text describing the command, or <b>Mnil</b> if the command has no description.

       STATUS is a symbol representing how the key assignment is decided. The value is <b>Mnil</b> (the default key
       assignment), <b>Mcustomized</b> (the key assignment is customized by per-user customization file), or
       <b>Mconfigured</b> (the key assignment is set by the call of <b>minput_config_command()</b>). For a local command only,
       it may also be <b>Minherited</b> (the key assignment is inherited from the corresponding global command).

       KEYSEQ is a plist of one or more symbols representing a key sequence assigned to the command. If there's
       no KEYSEQ, the command is currently disabled (i.e. no key sequence can trigger actions of the command).

       If <b>command</b> is not <b>Mnil</b>, the first element of the returned plist contains the information about <b>command</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       If the requested information was found, a pointer to a non-empty plist is returned. As the plist is kept
       in the library, the caller must not modify nor free it.

       Otherwise (the specified input method or the specified command does not exist), NULL is returned.

</pre><h4><b>Example:</b></h4><pre>
           MText *
           get_im_command_description (MSymbol language, MSymbol name, MSymbol command)
           {
             /* Return a description of the command COMMAND of the input method
                specified by LANGUAGE and NAME.  */
             MPlist *cmd = minput_get_command (language, name, command);
             MPlist *plist;

             if (! cmds)
               return NULL;
             plist = mplist_value (cmds);  /* (NAME DESCRIPTION STATUS KEY-SEQ ...) */
             plist = mplist_next (plist);  /* (DESCRIPTION STATUS KEY-SEQ ...) */
             return  (mplist_key (plist) == Mtext
                  ? (MText *) mplist_value (plist)
                  : NULL);
           }
