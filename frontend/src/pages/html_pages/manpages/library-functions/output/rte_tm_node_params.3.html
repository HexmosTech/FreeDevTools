       Node parameters

       Each non-leaf node has multiple inputs (its children nodes) and single output (which is input to its
       parent node). It arbitrates its inputs using Strict Priority (SP) and Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ)
       algorithms to schedule input packets to its output while observing its shaping (rate limiting)
       constraints.

       Algorithms such as Weighted Round Robin (WRR), Byte-level WRR, Deficit WRR (DWRR), etc. are considered
       approximations of the WFQ ideal and are assimilated to WFQ, although an associated implementation-
       dependent trade-off on accuracy, performance and resource usage might exist.

       Children nodes with different priorities are scheduled using the SP algorithm based on their priority,
       with zero (0) as the highest priority. Children with the same priority are scheduled using the WFQ
       algorithm according to their weights. The WFQ weight of a given child node is relative to the sum of the
       weights of all its sibling nodes that have the same priority, with one (1) as the lowest weight. For each
       SP priority, the WFQ weight mode can be set as either byte-based or packet-based.

       Each leaf node sits on top of a Tx queue of the current Ethernet port. Hence, the leaf nodes are
       predefined, with their node IDs set to 0 .. (N-1), where N is the number of Tx queues configured for the
       current Ethernet port. The non-leaf nodes have their IDs generated by the application.

</pre><h4><b>Field</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>shaper_profile_id</b>
       Shaper profile for the private shaper. The absence of the private shaper for the current node is
       indicated by setting this parameter to RTE_TM_SHAPER_PROFILE_ID_NONE.

       Definition at line <b>1097</b> of file <b>rte_tm.h</b>.

   <b>uint32_t*</b> <b>shared_shaper_id</b>
       User allocated array of valid shared shaper IDs.

       Definition at line <b>1100</b> of file <b>rte_tm.h</b>.

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>n_shared_shapers</b>
       Number of shared shaper IDs in the <u>shared_shaper_id</u> array.

       Definition at line <b>1103</b> of file <b>rte_tm.h</b>.

   <b>int*</b> <b>wfq_weight_mode</b>
       WFQ weight mode for each SP priority. When NULL, it indicates that WFQ is to be used for all priorities.
       When non-NULL, it points to a pre-allocated array of <u>n_sp_priorities</u> values, with non-zero value for
       byte-mode and zero for packet-mode.

       Definition at line <b>1116</b> of file <b>rte_tm.h</b>.

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>n_sp_priorities</b>
       Number of SP priorities.

       Definition at line <b>1119</b> of file <b>rte_tm.h</b>.

   <b>struct</b>  <b>{</b> <b>...</b> <b>}</b>  <b>nonleaf</b>
       Parameters only valid for non-leaf nodes.

   <b>enum</b> <b>rte_tm_cman_mode</b> <b>cman</b>
       Congestion management mode

       Definition at line <b>1125</b> of file <b>rte_tm.h</b>.

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>wred_profile_id</b>
       WRED profile for private WRED context. The absence of a private WRED context for the current leaf node is
       indicated by value RTE_TM_WRED_PROFILE_ID_NONE.

       Definition at line <b>1136</b> of file <b>rte_tm.h</b>.

   <b>uint32_t*</b> <b>shared_wred_context_id</b>
       User allocated array of shared WRED context IDs. When set to NULL, it indicates that the current leaf
       node should not currently be part of any shared WRED contexts.

       Definition at line <b>1143</b> of file <b>rte_tm.h</b>.

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>n_shared_wred_contexts</b>
       Number of elements in the <u>shared_wred_context_id</u> array. Only valid when <u>shared_wred_context_id</u> is non-
       NULL, in which case it should be non-zero.

       Definition at line <b>1150</b> of file <b>rte_tm.h</b>.

   <b>struct</b>  <b>{</b> <b>...</b> <b>}</b>  <b>wred</b>
       WRED parameters (only valid when <u>cman</u> is set to WRED).

   <b>struct</b>  <b>{</b> <b>...</b> <b>}</b>  <b>leaf</b>
       Parameters only valid for leaf nodes.

   <b>uint64_t</b> <b>stats_mask</b>
       Mask of statistics counter types to be enabled for this node. This needs to be a subset of the statistics
       counter types available for the current node. Any statistics counter type not included in this set is to
       be disabled for the current node.
