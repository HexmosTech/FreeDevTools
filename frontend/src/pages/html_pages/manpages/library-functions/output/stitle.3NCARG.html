</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       STITLE - Creates scrolled movie or video titles. It receives all input through the argument list.

</pre><h4><b>UTILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This routine is part of the Scrolled_title utility in NCAR Graphics.  To see the overview man page for
       this utility, type "man scrolled_title".

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        CALL STITLE (CRDS,NCDS,IYST,IYND,TMST,TMMV,TMND,MTST)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_stitle (char *crds[], int ncds, int iyst,
       int iynd, float tmst, float tmmv, float tmnd, int mtst)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       CRDS        (an input array, dimensioned NCDS, of type CHARACTER*n, where "n" is greater than or equal to
                   21) is the "card input buffer". This array must be filled, prior to calling STITLE, either by
                   internal  manipulations  or  by  reading  n-character "cards". Each element of the array CRDS
                   represents one line on the scroll (or, sometimes, a continuation  of  a  previous  line)  and
                   contains the following:

                   •      Columns  1-5: MX, the X coordinate of the line of text on the scroll. This is normally
                          a value between 1 and 1024, inclusive. Exactly how the  line  of  text  is  positioned
                          relative  to  the  specified  X  coordinate  depends  on the value of ICNT (in columns
                          14-15).

                          If the value -9999 is used for MX, it indicates a continuation line:  characters  from
                          columns  21  through "n" are just appended to the characters from the previous card to
                          form the line of text. Any number of continuation cards may be  used,  but  the  total
                          number of characters in a line of text must not be greater than 512.

                          Trailing  blanks  are  omitted  from each card, including those that are followed by a
                          continuation card; thus, if there are to be blanks between  the  characters  from  one
                          card  and  the  characters  from  a  continuation card, those blanks must be placed in
                          columns 21 and following of the continuation card.

                          On a continuation card, columns 6-20 are ignored.

                   •      Columns 6-10: MY, the Y coordinate of the line of text on the  scroll.  MY  may  range
                          from -9999 to 99999.

                   •      Columns  11-13: ICLR, the index of the color to be used for the line of text.  If this
                          field is blank, the default foreground color specified by the value  of  the  internal
                          parameter ´FGC´ will be used.

                   •      Columns 14-15: ICNT, the centering option:

                          0      means "start the text at MX".

                          1      means "center the text about MX".

                          2      means "end the text at MX".

                   •      Columns  16-20:  SIZE,  the  desired  size of the characters to be used in writing the
                          line. SIZE is given as a multiplier of a default height specified by the value of  the
                          internal  parameter  ´PSZ´,  the default value of which is 21 (out of 1024). Values of
                          SIZE from .75 to 2.5 are recommended.

                   •      Columns 21-n: Text for this line (or for continuation of a line when MX = -9999).

       NCDS        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the dimension of the array CRDS (i.e., the number of
                   card images in it).

       IYST        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the Y coordinate that will be at the center  of  the
                   screen when the text is first displayed.

       IYND        (an  input  expression of type INTEGER) is the Y coordinate that will be at the center of the
                   screen when the text is last displayed.

       TMST        (an input expression of type REAL) is the time in seconds that the scroll will be  stationary
                   at IYST. One second is recommended.

       TMMV        (an  input  expression  of  type REAL) is the time to move the scroll from IYST to IYND. This
                   should be the time required to read the text aloud at slow to normal speed.

       TMND        (an input expression of type REAL) is the time that the scroll will be  stationary  at  IYND.
                   One second is recommended.

       MTST        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is a switch to indicate whether this is a "real" run or
                   a "practice" run.

                   0      means "real run".

                   1      means "practice run".

                   During  real  runs,  frames  are  created for the fade-in sequence (if the user has turned on
                   fade-in by setting the internal parameter ´FIN´ non-zero), the  stationary  sequence  at  the
                   start  (if  TMST  is  non-zero),  the  scrolling  time  (if TMMV is non-zero), the stationary
                   sequence at the end (if TMND is non-zero), and the fade-out sequence (if the user has  turned
                   on fade-out by setting the internal parameter ´FOU´ non-zero).

                   During  practice runs, only selected frames are created: a frame for the fade-in sequence (if
                   fade-in is turned on), a frame for the  stationary  time  at  the  start,  a  set  of  frames
                   representing  the scrolling sequence, a frame for the stationary time at the end, and a frame
                   for the fade-out sequence (if fade-out is turned on). Each has a legend indicating either for
                   how many seconds the frame will be shown or, if it is part of a  scroll  sequence,  how  many
                   seconds  into  the  scroll  time  it  occurs; during real runs, these legends are omitted, of
                   course.

                   Fade-in and fade-out are also affected by the values of the internal parameters ´BGF´,  which
                   selects  the  type  of fade-in/fade-out to be used for the background color, and ´FGF´, which
                   serves the same function for the foreground color.  (The older parameters ´SBK´ and ´SFG´ may
                   still be referenced, but their use is no longer recommended; setting ´SBK´ has the effect  of
                   giving  ´BGF´  an  appropriate  value  and  setting  ´SFG´  has the effect of giving ´FGF´ an
                   apprpriate value.)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       STITLE takes input through its argument list and generates graphic output that moves a body  of  text  up
       through  the  viewing  window.  This  is  done by outputting the appropriate number of frames required to
       generate a movie sequence of a duration specified by you.

       At each frame STITLE skips plotting lines of text that are completely outside of the viewing  window  and
       clips those that are partially outside the window.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant examples: fslfont, slex01, slex02, tstitl.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use  STITLE  or  c_stitle,  load  the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, ncarg_c, and ncarg_c,
       preferably in that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       See the  scrolled_title  man  page  for  a  description  of  all  Scrolled_title  error  messages  and/or
       informational messages.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
