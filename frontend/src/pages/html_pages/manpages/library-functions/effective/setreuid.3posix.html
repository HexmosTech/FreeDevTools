</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       setreuid — set real and effective user IDs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;

       int setreuid(uid_t <u>ruid</u>, uid_t <u>euid</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>setreuid</u>()  function  shall set the real and effective user IDs of the current process to the values
       specified by the <u>ruid</u> and <u>euid</u> arguments. If <u>ruid</u> or <u>euid</u> is -1, the corresponding effective or real user
       ID of the current process shall be left unchanged.

       A process with appropriate privileges can set either ID to any value.  An unprivileged process  can  only
       set  the  effective user ID if the <u>euid</u> argument is equal to either the real, effective, or saved user ID
       of the process.

       If the real user ID is being set (<u>ruid</u> is not -1), or the effective user ID is being set to a  value  not
       equal  to  the  real user ID, then the saved set-user-ID of the current process shall be set equal to the
       new effective user ID.

       It is unspecified whether a process without appropriate privileges is permitted to change the  real  user
       ID to match the current effective user ID or saved set-user-ID of the process.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful  completion,  0  shall  be  returned.  Otherwise,  -1 shall be returned and <u>errno</u> set to
       indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>setreuid</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The value of the <u>ruid</u> or <u>euid</u> argument is invalid or out-of-range.

       <b>EPERM</b>  The current process does not have appropriate privileges, and either an attempt was made to change
              the effective user ID to a value other than the real user  ID  or  the  saved  set-user-ID  or  an
              attempt was made to change the real user ID to a value not permitted by the implementation.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Setting</b> <b>the</b> <b>Effective</b> <b>User</b> <b>ID</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Real</b> <b>User</b> <b>ID</b>
       The  following  example  sets  the  effective user ID of the calling process to the real user ID, so that
       files created later will be owned by the current user. It also sets the saved  set-user-ID  to  the  real
       user ID, so any future attempt to set the effective user ID back to its previous value will fail.

           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;
           #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
           ...
           setreuid(getuid(), getuid());
           ...

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Earlier  versions  of  this  standard  did  not  specify  whether  the  saved set-user-ID was affected by
       <u>setreuid</u>() calls. This version specifies common existing practice that constitutes an important  security
       feature.  The  ability to set both the effective user ID and saved set-user-ID to be the same as the real
       user ID means that any security weakness in code that is executed  after  that  point  cannot  result  in
       malicious  code being executed with the previous effective user ID. Privileged applications could already
       do this using just <u>setuid</u>(), but for non-privileged applications the only standard method available is to
       use this feature of <u>setreuid</u>().

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
