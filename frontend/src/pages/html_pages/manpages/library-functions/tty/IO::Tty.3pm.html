</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       IO::Tty - Low-level allocate a pseudo-Tty, import constants.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       1.20

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use IO::Tty qw(TIOCNOTTY);
           ...
           # use only to import constants, see IO::Pty to create ptys.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "IO::Tty" is used internally by "IO::Pty" to create a pseudo-tty.  You wouldn't want to use it directly
       except to import constants, use "IO::Pty".  For a list of importable constants, see IO::Tty::Constant.

       Windows is now supported, but ONLY under the Cygwin environment, see &lt;<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/</a>&gt;.

       Please note that pty creation is very system-dependend.  From my experience, any modern POSIX system
       should be fine.  Find below a list of systems that "IO::Tty" should work on.  A more detailed table
       (which is slowly getting out-of-date) is available from the project pages document manager at SourceForge
       &lt;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/expectperl/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/expectperl/</a>&gt;.

       If you have problems on your system and your system is listed in the "verified" list, you probably have
       some non-standard setup, e.g. you compiled your Linux-kernel yourself and disabled ptys (bummer!).
       Please ask your friendly sysadmin for help.

       If your system is not listed, unpack the latest version of "IO::Tty", do a 'perl Makefile.PL; make; make
       test; uname -a' and send me (<u><a href="mailto:RGiersig@cpan.org">RGiersig@cpan.org</a></u>) the results and I'll see what I can deduce from that.
       There are chances that it will work right out-of-the-box...

       If it's working on your system, please send me a short note with details (version number, distribution,
       etc. 'uname -a' and 'perl -V' is a good start; also, the output from "perl Makefile.PL" contains a lot of
       interesting info, so please include that as well) so I can get an overview.  Thanks!

</pre><h4><b>VERIFIED</b> <b>SYSTEMS,</b> <b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       This is a list of systems that "IO::Tty" seems to work on ('make test' passes) with comments about
       "features":

       •   AIX 4.3

           Returns EIO instead of EOF when the slave is closed.  Benign.

       •   AIX 5.x

       •   FreeBSD 4.4

           EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

       •   OpenBSD 2.8

           The    ioctl    TIOCSCTTY    sometimes    fails.    This   is   also   known   in   Tcl/Expect,   see
           <a href="http://expect.nist.gov/FAQ.html">http://expect.nist.gov/FAQ.html</a>

           EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

       •   Darwin 7.9.0

       •   HPUX 10.20 &amp; 11.00

           EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

       •   IRIX 6.5

       •   Linux 2.2.x &amp; 2.4.x

           Returns EIO instead of EOF when the slave is closed.  Benign.

       •   OSF 4.0

           EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

       •   Solaris 8, 2.7, 2.6

           Has the "feature" of returning EOF just once?!

           EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

       •   Windows NT/2k/XP (under Cygwin)

           When you send (print) a too long line (&gt;160 chars) to a non-raw pty, the call just hangs forever  and
           even <b>alarm()</b> cannot get you out.  Don't complain to me...

           EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

       •   z/OS

       The following systems have not been verified yet for this version, but a previous version worked on them:

       •   SCO Unix

       •   NetBSD

           probably the same as the other *BSDs...
