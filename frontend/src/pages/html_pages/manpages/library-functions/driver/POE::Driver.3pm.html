       POE::Driver - an abstract interface for buffered, non-blocking I/O

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This is a contrived example of how POE::Filter and POE::Driver objects may be used in a stand-alone
       application.

         my $driver = POE::Driver::SysRW-&gt;new();
         my $filter = POE::Filter::Line-&gt;new();

         my $list_of_octet_chunks = $filter-&gt;put("A line of text.");

         $driver-&gt;put( $list_of_octet_chunks );

         my $octets_remaining_in_buffer = $driver-&gt;flush($filehandle);
         die "couldn't flush everything" if $octets_remaining_in_buffer;

         while (1) {
           my $octets_list = $driver-&gt;get($filehandle);
           die $! unless defined $octets_list;

           $filter-&gt;get_one_start($octets_list);
           while (my $line = $filter-&gt;get_one()) {
             print "Input: $line\n";
           }
         }

       Most programs will use POE::Filter and POE::Driver objects as parameters to POE::Wheel constructors.  See
       the synopses for particular classes for details.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Driver is a common API for I/O drivers that can read from and write to various files, sockets,
       pipes, and other devices.

       POE "drivers" implement the specifics of reading and writing to devices.  Drivers plug into POE::Wheel
       objects so that wheels may support a large number of device types without implementing a separate
       subclass for each.

       As mentioned in the SYNOPSIS, POE::Driver objects may be used in stand-alone applications.

   <b>Public</b> <b>Driver</b> <b>Methods</b>
       These methods are the generic Driver interface, and every driver must implement them.  Specific drivers
       may have additional methods related to their particular tasks.

       <u>new</u>

       <b>new()</b> creates, initializes, and returns a new driver.  Specific drivers may have different constructor
       parameters.  The default constructor parameters should configure the driver for the most common use case.

       <u>get</u> <u>FILEHANDLE</u>

       <b>get()</b> immediately tries to read information from a FILEHANDLE.  It returns an array reference on
       success---even if nothing was read from the FILEHANDLE.  <b>get()</b> returns undef on error, and $! will be set
       to the reason why <b>get()</b> failed.

       The returned arrayref will be empty if nothing was read from the FILEHANDLE.

       In an EOF condition, <b>get()</b> returns undef with the numeric value of $!  set to zero.

       The arrayref returned by <b>get()</b> is suitable for passing to any POE::Filter's <b>get()</b> or <b>get_one_start()</b>
       method.  Wheels do exactly this internally.

       put ARRAYREF
           <b>put()</b>  accepts  an  ARRAYREF  of  raw  octet chunks.  These octets are added to the driver's internal
           output queue or buffer.  <b>put()</b> returns the number of octets pending output after the new  octets  are
           buffered.

           Some drivers may flush data immediately from their <b>put()</b> methods.

       flush FILEHANDLE
           <b>flush()</b> attempts to write a driver's buffered data to a given FILEHANDLE.  The driver should flush as
           much data as possible in a single <b>flush()</b> call.

           <b>flush()</b>  returns  the  number  of  octets  remaining in the driver's output queue or buffer after the
           maximum amount of data has been written.

           <b>flush()</b> denotes success or failure by the value of $! after it returns.  $! will  always  numerically
           equal  zero  on success.  On failure, $! will contain the usual Errno value.  In either case, <b>flush()</b>
           will return the number of octets in the driver's output queue.

       get_out_messages_buffered
           <b>get_out_messages_buffered()</b> returns the number of messages enqueued in  the  driver's  output  queue,
           rounded up to the nearest whole message.  Some applications require the message count rather than the
           octet count.

           Messages  are raw octet chunks enqueued by <b>put()</b>.  The following <b>put()</b> call enqueues two messages for
           a total of six octets:

             $filter-&gt;put( [ "one", "two" ] );

           It is possible for a <b>flush()</b> call to write part of a message.  A partial message still counts as  one
           message.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The SEE ALSO section in POE contains a table of contents covering the entire POE distribution.

       POE::Wheel - A base class for POE::Session mix-ins.

       POE::Filter - A base class for data parsers and serializers.

       POE::Driver::SysRW - A driver that encapsulates <b>sysread()</b> and buffered <b>syswrite()</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There  is no POE::Driver::SendRecv, but nobody has needed one so far.  <b>sysread()</b> and <b>syswrite()</b> manage to
       do almost everything people need.

       In theory, drivers should be pretty much interchangeable.  In practice, there seems to be an  impermeable
       barrier between the different SOCK_* types.
