       DBI::DBD - Perl DBI Database Driver Writer's Guide

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         perldoc DBI::DBD

   <b>Version</b> <b>and</b> <b>volatility</b>
       This document is <u>still</u> a minimal draft which is in need of further work.

       Please read the <b>DBI</b> documentation first and fully.  Then look at the implementation of some high-profile
       and regularly maintained drivers like DBD::Oracle, DBD::ODBC, DBD::Pg etc. (Those are no no particular
       order.)

       Then reread the <b>DBI</b> specification and the code of those drivers again as you're reading this. It'll help.
       Where this document and the driver code differ it's likely that the driver code is more correct,
       especially if multiple drivers do the same thing.

       This document is a patchwork of contributions from various authors.  More contributions (preferably as
       patches) are very welcome.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document is primarily intended to help people writing new database drivers for the Perl Database
       Interface (Perl DBI).  It may also help others interested in discovering why the internals of a <b>DBD</b>
       driver are written the way they are.

       This is a guide.  Few (if any) of the statements in it are completely authoritative under all possible
       circumstances.  This means you will need to use judgement in applying the guidelines in this document.
       If in <u>any</u> doubt at all, please do contact the <u>dbi-dev</u> mailing list (details given below) where Tim Bunce
       and other driver authors can help.

</pre><h4><b>CREATING</b> <b>A</b> <b>NEW</b> <b>DRIVER</b></h4><pre>
       The first rule for creating a new database driver for the Perl DBI is very simple: <b>DON'T!</b>

       There is usually a driver already available for the database you want to use, almost regardless of which
       database you choose. Very often, the database will provide an ODBC driver interface, so you can often use
       <b>DBD::ODBC</b> to access the database. This is typically less convenient on a Unix box than on a Microsoft
       Windows box, but there are numerous options for ODBC driver managers on Unix too, and very often the ODBC
       driver is provided by the database supplier.

       Before deciding that you need to write a driver, do your homework to ensure that you are not wasting your
       energies.

       [As of December 2002, the consensus is that if you need an ODBC driver manager on Unix, then the unixODBC
       driver (available from &lt;<a href="http://www.unixodbc.org/">http://www.unixodbc.org/</a>&gt;) is the way to go.]

       The second rule for creating a new database driver for the Perl DBI is also very simple: <b>Don't</b> <b>--</b> <b>get</b>
       <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>you!</b>

       Nevertheless, there are occasions when it is necessary to write a new driver, often to use a proprietary
       language or API to access the database more swiftly, or more comprehensively, than an ODBC driver can.
       Then you should read this document very carefully, but with a suitably sceptical eye.

       If there is something in here that does not make any sense, question it.  You might be right that the
       information is bogus, but don't come to that conclusion too quickly.

   <b>URLs</b> <b>and</b> <b>mailing</b> <b>lists</b>
       The primary web-site for locating <b>DBI</b> software and information is

         <a href="http://dbi.perl.org/">http://dbi.perl.org/</a>

       There are two main and one auxiliary mailing lists for people working with <b>DBI</b>.  The primary lists are
       <u><a href="mailto:dbi-users@perl.org">dbi-users@perl.org</a></u> for general users of <b>DBI</b> and <b>DBD</b> drivers, and <u><a href="mailto:dbi-dev@perl.org">dbi-dev@perl.org</a></u> mainly for <b>DBD</b> driver
       writers (don't join the <u>dbi-dev</u> list unless you have a good reason).  The auxiliary list is
       <u><a href="mailto:dbi-announce@perl.org">dbi-announce@perl.org</a></u> for announcing new releases of <b>DBI</b> or <b>DBD</b> drivers.

       You can join these lists by accessing the web-site &lt;<a href="http://dbi.perl.org/">http://dbi.perl.org/</a>&gt;.  The lists are closed so you
       cannot send email to any of the lists unless you join the list first.

       You should also consider monitoring the <u>comp.lang.perl.*</u> newsgroups, especially <u>comp.lang.perl.modules</u>.

   <b>The</b> <b>Cheetah</b> <b>book</b>
       The definitive book on Perl DBI is the Cheetah book, so called because of the picture on the cover. Its
       proper title is '<u>Programming</u> <u>the</u> <u>Perl</u> <u>DBI:</u> <u>Database</u> <u>programming</u> <u>with</u> <u>Perl</u>' by Alligator Descartes and Tim
       Bunce, published by O'Reilly Associates, February 2000, ISBN 1-56592-699-4. Buy it now if you have not
       already done so, and read it.

   <b>Locating</b> <b>drivers</b>
       Before writing a new driver, it is in your interests to find out whether there already is a driver for
       your database.  If there is such a driver, it would be much easier to make use of it than to write your
       own!

       The primary web-site for locating Perl software is &lt;<a href="http://search.cpan.org/">http://search.cpan.org/</a>&gt;.  You should look under the
       various modules listings for the software you are after. For example:

         <a href="http://search.cpan.org/modlist/Database_Interfaces">http://search.cpan.org/modlist/Database_Interfaces</a>

       Follow the <b>DBD::</b> and <b>DBIx::</b> links at the top to see those subsets.

       See the <b>DBI</b> docs for information on <b>DBI</b> web sites and mailing lists.

   <b>Registering</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>driver</b>
       Before going through any official registration process, you will need to establish that there is no
       driver already in the works. You'll do that by asking the <b>DBI</b> mailing lists whether there is such a
       driver available, or whether anybody is working on one.

       When you get the go ahead, you will need to establish the name of the driver and a prefix for the driver.
       Typically, the name is based on the name of the database software it uses, and the prefix is a
       contraction of that. Hence, <b>DBD::Oracle</b> has the name <u>Oracle</u> and the prefix '<u>ora</u><b>_</b>'. The prefix must be
       lowercase and contain no underscores other than the one at the end.

       This information will be recorded in the <b>DBI</b> module. Apart from documentation purposes, registration is a
       prerequisite for installing private methods.

       If you are writing a driver which will not be distributed on CPAN, then you should choose a prefix
       beginning with '<u>x</u><b>_</b>', to avoid potential prefix collisions with drivers registered in the future. Thus, if
       you wrote a non-CPAN distributed driver called <b>DBD::CustomDB</b>, the prefix might be '<u>x_cdb</u><b>_</b>'.

       This document assumes you are writing a driver called <b>DBD::Driver</b>, and that the prefix '<u>drv</u><b>_</b>' is assigned
       to the driver.

   <b>Two</b> <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>database</b> <b>driver</b>
       There are two distinct styles of database driver that can be written to work with the Perl DBI.

       Your driver can be written in pure Perl, requiring no C compiler.  When feasible, this is the best
       solution, but most databases are not written in such a way that this can be done. Some examples of pure
       Perl drivers are <b>DBD::File</b> and <b>DBD::CSV</b>.

       Alternatively, and most commonly, your driver will need to use some C code to gain access to the
       database. This will be classified as a C/XS driver.

   <b>What</b> <b>code</b> <b>will</b> <b>you</b> <b>write?</b>
       There are a number of files that need to be written for either a pure Perl driver or a C/XS driver. There
       are no extra files needed only by a pure Perl driver, but there are several extra files needed only by a
       C/XS driver.

       <u>Files</u> <u>common</u> <u>to</u> <u>pure</u> <u>Perl</u> <u>and</u> <u>C/XS</u> <u>drivers</u>

       Assuming that your driver is called <b>DBD::Driver</b>, these files are:

       •   <u>Makefile.PL</u>

       •   <u>META.yml</u>

       •   <u>README</u>

       •   <u>MANIFEST</u>

       •   <u>Driver.pm</u>

       •   <u>lib/Bundle/DBD/Driver.pm</u>

       •   <u>lib/DBD/Driver/Summary.pm</u>

       •   <u>t/*.t</u>

       The first four files are mandatory. <u>Makefile.PL</u> is used to control how the driver is built and installed.
       The  <u>README</u>  file  tells  people who download the file about how to build the module and any prerequisite
       software that must be installed. The <u>MANIFEST</u> file is used  by  the  standard  Perl  module  distribution
       mechanism.  It lists all the source files that need to be distributed with your module. <u>Driver.pm</u> is what
       is loaded by the <b>DBI</b> code; it contains the methods peculiar to your driver.

       Although the <u>META.yml</u> file is not <b>required</b> you are advised to create one. Of  particular  importance  are
       the  <u>build_requires</u> and <u>configure_requires</u> attributes which newer CPAN modules understand.  You use these
       to tell the CPAN module (and CPANPLUS) that your build and configure mechanisms  require  DBI.  The  best
       reference        for        META.yml        (at        the        time        of        writing)       is
       &lt;<a href="http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec-v1.4.html">http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec-v1.4.html</a>&gt;.  You  can  find  a  reasonable  example  of  a
       <u>META.yml</u> in DBD::ODBC.

       The  <u>lib/Bundle/DBD/Driver.pm</u>  file  allows you to specify other Perl modules on which yours depends in a
       format that allows someone to type a simple command and ensure that all the pre-requisites are  in  place
       as well as building your driver.

       The  <u>lib/DBD/Driver/Summary.pm</u>  file contains (an updated version of) the information that was included -
       or that would have been included - in the appendices of the Cheetah book as a summary of the abilities of
       your driver and the associated database.

       The files in the <u>t</u> subdirectory are unit  tests  for  your  driver.   You  should  write  your  tests  as
       stringently as possible, while taking into account the diversity of installations that you can encounter:

       •   Your tests should not casually modify operational databases.

       •   You should never damage existing tables in a database.

       •   You  should  code  your  tests  to use a constrained name space within the database. For example, the
           tables (and all other named objects) that are created could all begin with '<u>dbd_drv</u><b>_</b>'.

       •   At the end of a test run, there should be no testing objects left behind in the database.

       •   If you create any databases, you should remove them.

       •   If your database supports temporary tables that are automatically removed at the end  of  a  session,
           then exploit them as often as possible.

       •   Try  to make your tests independent of each other. If you have a test <u>t/t11dowhat.t</u> that depends upon
           the successful running of <u>t/t10thingamy.t</u>, people cannot run  the  single  test  case  <u>t/t11dowhat.t</u>.
           Further,  running <u>t/t11dowhat.t</u> twice in a row is likely to fail (at least, if <u>t/t11dowhat.t</u> modifies
           the database at all) because the database at the start of the second run is not what you saw  at  the
           start of the first run.

       •   Document in your <u>README</u> file what you do, and what privileges people need to do it.

       •   You  can,  and  probably should, sequence your tests by including a test number before an abbreviated
           version of the test name; the tests are run in the order in which the names are  expanded  by  shell-
           style globbing.

       •   It is in your interests to ensure that your tests work as widely as possible.

       Many  drivers  also install sub-modules <b>DBD::Driver::SubModule</b> for any of a variety of different reasons,
       such as to support the metadata methods (see the discussion  of  "METADATA  METHODS"  below).  Such  sub-
       modules  are conventionally stored in the directory <u>lib/DBD/Driver</u>. The module itself would usually be in
       a file <u>SubModule.pm</u>. All such sub-modules should themselves be version stamped (see the  discussions  far
       below).

       <u>Extra</u> <u>files</u> <u>needed</u> <u>by</u> <u>C/XS</u> <u>drivers</u>

       The  software for a C/XS driver will typically contain at least four extra files that are not relevant to
       a pure Perl driver.

       •   <u>Driver.xs</u>

       •   <u>Driver.h</u>

       •   <u>dbdimp.h</u>

       •   <u>dbdimp.c</u>

       The <u>Driver.xs</u> file is used to generate C code that Perl can call to gain access to the  C  functions  you
       write that will, in turn, call down onto your database software.

       The  <u>Driver.h</u>  header is a stylized header that ensures you can access the necessary Perl and <b>DBI</b> macros,
       types, and function declarations.

       The <u>dbdimp.h</u> is used to specify which functions have been implemented by your driver.

       The <u>dbdimp.c</u> file is where you write the C code that does the real work of translating  between  Perl-ish
       data types and what the database expects to use and return.

       There  are  some  (mainly  small, but very important) differences between the contents of <u>Makefile.PL</u> and
       <u>Driver.pm</u> for pure Perl and C/XS drivers, so those files are described both in the section on creating  a
       pure Perl driver and in the section on creating a C/XS driver.

       Obviously, you can add extra source code files to the list.

   <b>Requirements</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>driver</b> <b>and</b> <b>driver</b> <b>writer</b>
       To  be  remotely useful, your driver must be implemented in a format that allows it to be distributed via
       CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (&lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a>&gt; and  &lt;<a href="http://search.cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org</a>&gt;).   Of
       course,  it is easier if you do not have to meet this criterion, but you will not be able to ask for much
       help if you do not do so, and no-one is likely to want to install your module if they have to learn a new
       installation mechanism.

</pre><h4><b>CREATING</b> <b>A</b> <b>PURE</b> <b>PERL</b> <b>DRIVER</b></h4><pre>
       Writing a pure Perl driver is surprisingly simple. However, there are some problems you should  be  aware
       of.  The  best option is of course picking up an existing driver and carefully modifying one method after
       the other.

       Also look carefully at <b>DBD::AnyData</b> and <b>DBD::Template</b>.

       As an example we take a look at the <b>DBD::File</b> driver, a driver for accessing plain files as tables, which
       is part of the <b>DBD::CSV</b> package.

       The minimal set of files we have to implement are <u>Makefile.PL</u>, <u>README</u>, <u>MANIFEST</u> and <u>Driver.pm</u>.

   <b>Pure</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Makefile.PL</b>
       You typically start with writing <u>Makefile.PL</u>, a  Makefile  generator.  The  contents  of  this  file  are
       described  in  detail  in  the  ExtUtils::MakeMaker  man pages. It is definitely a good idea if you start
       reading them. At least you should know about the variables <u>CONFIGURE</u>, <u>DEFINED</u>, <u>PM</u>, <u>DIR</u>,  <u>EXE_FILES</u>,  <u>INC</u>,
       <u>LIBS</u>,  <u>LINKTYPE</u>,  <u>NAME</u>,  <u>OPTIMIZE</u>,  <u>PL_FILES</u>,  <u>VERSION</u>,  <u>VERSION_FROM</u>,  <u>clean</u>, <u>depend</u>, <u>realclean</u> from the
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker man page: these are used in almost any <u>Makefile.PL</u>.

       Additionally read the section on <u>Overriding</u> <u>MakeMaker</u> <u>Methods</u> and  the  descriptions  of  the  <u>distcheck</u>,
       <u>disttest</u> and <u>dist</u> targets: They will definitely be useful for you.

       Of special importance for <b>DBI</b> drivers is the <u>postamble</u> method from the ExtUtils::MM_Unix man page.

       For  Emacs  users, I recommend the <u>libscan</u> method, which removes Emacs backup files (file names which end
       with a tilde '~') from lists of files.

       Now an example, I use the word "Driver" wherever you should insert your driver's name:

         # -*- perl -*-

         use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;

         WriteMakefile(
             dbd_edit_mm_attribs( {
                 'NAME'         =&gt; 'DBD::Driver',
                 'VERSION_FROM' =&gt; 'Driver.pm',
                 'INC'          =&gt; '',
                 'dist'         =&gt; { 'SUFFIX'   =&gt; '.gz',
                                     'COMPRESS' =&gt; 'gzip -9f' },
                 'realclean'    =&gt; { FILES =&gt; '*.xsi' },
                 'PREREQ_PM'    =&gt; '1.03',
                 'CONFIGURE'    =&gt; sub {
                     eval {require DBI::DBD;};
                     if ($@) {
                         warn $@;
                         exit 0;
                     }
                     my $dbi_arch_dir = dbd_dbi_arch_dir();
                     if (exists($opts{INC})) {
                         return {INC =&gt; "$opts{INC} -I$dbi_arch_dir"};
                     } else {
                         return {INC =&gt; "-I$dbi_arch_dir"};
                     }
                 }
             },
             { create_pp_tests =&gt; 1})
         );

         package MY;
         sub postamble { return main::dbd_postamble(@_); }
         sub libscan {
             my ($self, $path) = @_;
             ($path =~ m/\~$/) ? undef : $path;
         }

       Note the calls to dbd_edit_mm_attribs() and dbd_postamble().

       The second hash  reference  in  the  call  to  dbd_edit_mm_attribs()  (containing  create_pp_tests())  is
       optional;  you should not use it unless your driver is a pure Perl driver (that is, it does not use C and
       XS code). Therefore, the call to dbd_edit_mm_attribs() is not  relevant  for  C/XS  drivers  and  may  be
       omitted;  simply  use  the  (single)  hash  reference  containing  NAME  etc  as  the  only  argument  to
       WriteMakefile().

       Note that the dbd_edit_mm_attribs() code will fail if you do not have a  <u>t</u>  sub-directory  containing  at
       least one test case.

       <u>PREREQ_PM</u>  tells  MakeMaker  that  DBI (version 1.03 in this case) is required for this module. This will
       issue a warning that DBI 1.03 is missing if someone attempts to install your DBD without  DBI  1.03.  See
       <u>CONFIGURE</u>  below  for why this does not work reliably in stopping cpan testers failing your module if DBI
       is not installed.

       <u>CONFIGURE</u> is a subroutine called by MakeMaker during "WriteMakefile".  By putting the "require  DBI::DBD"
       in  this  section  we  can attempt to load DBI::DBD but if it is missing we exit with success. As we exit
       successfully without creating a Makefile when DBI::DBD is missing cpan testers will not report a failure.
       This may seem at odds with <u>PREREQ_PM</u> but <u>PREREQ_PM</u> does not cause "WriteMakefile"  to  fail  (unless  you
       also  specify  PREREQ_FATAL which is strongly discouraged by MakeMaker) so "WriteMakefile" would continue
       to call "dbd_dbi_arch_dir" and fail.

       All drivers must use dbd_postamble() or risk running into problems.

       Note the specification of <u>VERSION_FROM</u>; the named file (<u>Driver.pm</u>) will be scanned  for  the  first  line
       that  looks like an assignment to <u>$VERSION</u>, and the subsequent text will be used to determine the version
       number.  Note the commentary in  ExtUtils::MakeMaker  on  the  subject  of  correctly  formatted  version
       numbers.

       If your driver depends upon external software (it usually will), you will need to add code to ensure that
       your  environment  is workable before the call to WriteMakefile(). If you need to check for the existence
       of an external library and perhaps modify <u>INC</u> to include the paths to where the external  library  header
       files  are  located and you cannot find the library or header files make sure you output a message saying
       they cannot be found but "exit 0" (success) <b>before</b> calling "WriteMakefile" or CPAN testers will fail your
       module if the external library is not found.

       A full-fledged <u>Makefile.PL</u> can be quite large (for example, the files for <b>DBD::Oracle</b>  and  <b>DBD::Informix</b>
       are both over 1000 lines long, and the Informix one uses - and creates - auxiliary modules too).

       See   also  ExtUtils::MakeMaker  and  ExtUtils::MM_Unix.  Consider  using  CPAN::MakeMaker  in  place  of
       <u>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</u>.

   <b>README</b>
       The README file should describe what the driver is for, the pre-requisites for  the  build  process,  the
       actual build process, how to report errors, and who to report them to.

       Users  will  find  ways  of  breaking  the  driver build and test process which you would never even have
       dreamed to be possible in your worst nightmares. Therefore, you need to write this document  defensively,
       precisely and concisely.

       As  always,  use  the  <u>README</u> from one of the established drivers as a basis for your own; the version in
       <b>DBD::Informix</b> is worth a look as it has been quite successful in heading off problems.

       •   Note that users will have versions of Perl and <b>DBI</b> that are both older and newer than  you  expected,
           but  this will seldom cause much trouble.  When it does, it will be because you are using features of
           <b>DBI</b> that are not supported in the version they are using.

       •   Note that users will have versions of the database software that are both older and  newer  than  you
           expected. You will save yourself time in the long run if you can identify the range of versions which
           have been tested and warn about versions which are not known to be OK.

       •   Note that many people trying to install your driver will not be experts in the database software.

       •   Note that many people trying to install your driver will not be experts in C or Perl.

   <b>MANIFEST</b>
       The  <u>MANIFEST</u>  will  be  used  by  the  Makefile's dist target to build the distribution tar file that is
       uploaded to CPAN. It should list every file that you want to include in your distribution, one per line.

   <b>lib/Bundle/DBD/Driver.pm</b>
       The CPAN module provides an extremely powerful bundle mechanism that allows you to specify pre-requisites
       for your driver.

       The primary pre-requisite is <b>Bundle::DBI</b>; you may want or need to add some more. With the bundle  set  up
       correctly, the user can type:

               perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::DBD::Driver'

       and Perl will download, compile, test and install all the Perl modules needed to build your driver.

       The  prerequisite  modules  are  listed  in  the "CONTENTS" section, with the official name of the module
       followed by a dash and an informal name or description.

       •   Listing <b>Bundle::DBI</b> as the main pre-requisite simplifies life.

       •   Don't forget to list your driver.

       •   Note that unless the DBMS is itself a Perl module, you cannot list it  as  a  pre-requisite  in  this
           file.

       •   You should keep the version of the bundle the same as the version of your driver.

       •   You should add configuration management, copyright, and licensing information at the top.

       A suitable skeleton for this file is shown below.

         =head1 NAME

         Bundle::DBD::Driver - A bundle to install all DBD::Driver related modules

         =head1 SYNOPSIS

         C&lt;perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::DBD::Driver'&gt;

         =head1 CONTENTS

         Bundle::DBI  - Bundle for DBI by TIMB (Tim Bunce)

         DBD::Driver  - DBD::Driver by YOU (Your Name)

         =head1 DESCRIPTION

         This bundle includes all the modules used by the Perl Database
         Interface (DBI) driver for Driver (DBD::Driver), assuming the
         use of DBI version 1.13 or later, created by Tim Bunce.

         If you've not previously used the CPAN module to install any
         bundles, you will be interrogated during its setup phase.
         But when you've done it once, it remembers what you told it.
         You could start by running:

           C&lt;perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::CPAN'&gt;

         This bundle was created by ripping off Bundle::libnet created by
         Graham Barr E&lt;lt&gt;F&lt;<a href="mailto:gbarr@ti.com">gbarr@ti.com</a>&gt;E&lt;gt&gt;, and radically simplified
         with some information from Jochen Wiedmann E&lt;lt&gt;F&lt;<a href="mailto:joe@ispsoft.de">joe@ispsoft.de</a>&gt;E&lt;gt&gt;.
         The template was then included in the DBI::DBD documentation by

   <b>lib/DBD/Driver/Summary.pm</b>
       There  is  no  substitute  for taking the summary file from a driver that was documented in the Perl book
       (such as <b>DBD::Oracle</b> or <b>DBD::Informix</b> or <b>DBD::ODBC</b>, to name but three), and adapting it to  describe  the
       facilities available via <b>DBD::Driver</b> when accessing the Driver database.

   <b>Pure</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Driver.pm</b>
       The  <u>Driver.pm</u>  file  defines  the  Perl  module  <b>DBD::Driver</b>  for your driver.  It will define a package
       <b>DBD::Driver</b> along with some version information, some variable definitions, and a function driver() which
       will have a more or less standard structure.

       It will also define three sub-packages of <b>DBD::Driver</b>:

       DBD::Driver::dr
           with methods connect(), data_sources() and disconnect_all();

       DBD::Driver::db
           with methods such as prepare();

       DBD::Driver::st
           with methods such as execute() and fetch().

       The <u>Driver.pm</u> file will also contain the documentation specific to <b>DBD::Driver</b>  in  the  format  used  by
       perldoc.

       In a pure Perl driver, the <u>Driver.pm</u> file is the core of the implementation. You will need to provide all
       the key methods needed by <b>DBI</b>.

       Now let's take a closer look at an excerpt of <u>File.pm</u> as an example.  We ignore things that are common to
       any module (even non-DBI modules) or really specific to the <b>DBD::File</b> package.

       <u>The</u> <u>DBD::Driver</u> <u>package</u>

       The header

         package DBD::File;

         use strict;

         our $VERSION = "1.23.00"  # Version number of DBD::File

       This  is  where  the  version number of your driver is specified, and is where <u>Makefile.PL</u> looks for this
       information. Please ensure that any other modules added with your driver are also version stamped so that
       CPAN does not get confused.

       It is recommended that you use a two-part (1.23) or three-part (1.23.45) version  number.  Also  consider
       the  CPAN  system, which gets confused and considers version 1.10 to precede version 1.9, so that using a
       raw CVS, RCS or SCCS version number is probably not appropriate (despite being very common).

       For Subversion you could use:

         our $VERSION = "12.012346";

       (use lots of leading zeros on the second portion so if you move the code  to  a  shared  repository  like
       svn.perl.org  the much larger revision numbers won't cause a problem, at least not for a few years).  For
       RCS or CVS you can use:

         our $VERSION = "11.22";

       which pads out the fractional part with leading zeros so all is well (so long as you don't go past x.99)

         our $drh = undef;         # holds driver handle once initialized

       This is where the driver handle will be stored, once created.  Note that you may assume there is only one
       handle for your driver.

       The driver constructor

       The driver() method is the driver handle constructor. Note that the driver() method is in the <b>DBD::Driver</b>
       package, not in one of the sub-packages <b>DBD::Driver::dr</b>, <b>DBD::Driver::db</b>, or <b>DBD::Driver::db</b>.

         sub driver
         {
             return $drh if $drh;      # already created - return same one
             my ($class, $attr) = @_;

             $class .= "::dr";

             DBD::Driver::db-&gt;install_method('drv_example_dbh_method');
             DBD::Driver::st-&gt;install_method('drv_example_sth_method');

             # not a 'my' since we use it above to prevent multiple drivers
             $drh = DBI::_new_drh($class, {
                     'Name'        =&gt; 'File',
                     'Version'     =&gt; $VERSION,
                     'Attribution' =&gt; 'DBD::File by Jochen Wiedmann',
                 })
                 or return undef;

             return $drh;
         }

       This is a reasonable example of how <b>DBI</b> implements its handles. There are  three  kinds:  <b>driver</b>  <b>handles</b>
       (typically  stored  in <u>$drh</u>; from now on called <u>drh</u> or <u>$drh</u>), <b>database</b> <b>handles</b> (from now on called <u>dbh</u> or
       <u>$dbh</u>) and <b>statement</b> <b>handles</b> (from now on called <u>sth</u> or <u>$sth</u>).

       The prototype of DBI::_new_drh() is

         $drh = DBI::_new_drh($class, $public_attrs, $private_attrs);

       with the following arguments:

       <u>$class</u>
           is typically the class for your driver, (for example, "DBD::File::dr"), passed as the first  argument
           to the driver() method.

       <u>$public_attrs</u>
           is  a  hash  ref  to attributes like <u>Name</u>, <u>Version</u>, and <u>Attribution</u>.  These are processed and used by
           <b>DBI</b>. You had better not make any assumptions about them nor should you add private attributes here.

       <u>$private_attrs</u>
           This is another (optional) hash ref with your private attributes.  <b>DBI</b> will store them and  otherwise
           leave them alone.

       The  DBI::_new_drh()  method  and  the driver() method both return "undef" for failure (in which case you
       must look at <u>$DBI::err</u> and <u>$DBI::errstr</u> for the failure information, because you have no driver handle to
       use).

       Using <b>install_method()</b> to expose driver-private methods

           DBD::Foo::db-&gt;install_method($method_name, \%attr);

       Installs the driver-private method named by $method_name into the DBI method  dispatcher  so  it  can  be
       called directly, avoiding the need to use the <b>func()</b> method.

       It  is  called  as  a static method on the driver class to which the method belongs. The method name must
       begin with the corresponding registered driver-private prefix. For example, for DBD::Oracle  $method_name
       must being with '"ora_"', and for DBD::AnyData it must begin with '"ad_"'.

       The  "\%attr"  attributes  can  be  used  to provide fine control over how the DBI dispatcher handles the
       dispatching of the method. However it's undocumented at the moment. See the IMA_* #define's in DBI.xs and
       the O=&gt;0x000x values in the initialization of %DBI::DBI_methods in DBI.pm.  (Volunteers to polish up  and
       document the interface are very welcome to get in touch via <a href="mailto:dbi-dev@perl.org">dbi-dev@perl.org</a>).

       Methods  installed using install_method default to the standard error handling behaviour for DBI methods:
       clearing err and errstr before calling the method, and checking for errors to trigger RaiseError etc.  on
       return. This differs from the default behaviour of <b>func()</b>.

       Note  for  driver authors: The DBD::Foo::xx-&gt;install_method call won't work until the class-hierarchy has
       been  setup.  Normally  the  DBI  looks  after  that  just  after  the  driver  is  loaded.  This   means
       <b>install_method()</b>  can't  be  called at the time the driver is loaded unless the class-hierarchy is set up
       first. The way to do that is to call the <b>setup_driver()</b> method:

           DBI-&gt;setup_driver('DBD::Foo');

       before using <b>install_method()</b>.

       The CLONE special subroutine

       Also needed here, in the <b>DBD::Driver</b> package, is a CLONE() method that will be called  by  perl  when  an
       interpreter  is  cloned.  All your CLONE() method needs to do, currently, is clear the cached <u>$drh</u> so the
       new interpreter won't start using the cached <u>$drh</u> from the old interpreter:

         sub CLONE {
           undef $drh;
         }

       See &lt;<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl/pod/perlmod.pod">http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl/pod/perlmod.pod</a>#Making_your_module_threadsafe&gt; for details.

       <u>The</u> <u>DBD::Driver::dr</u> <u>package</u>

       The next lines of code look as follows:

         package DBD::Driver::dr; # ====== DRIVER ======

         $DBD::Driver::dr::imp_data_size = 0;

       Note that no <u>@ISA</u> is needed here, or for the other <b>DBD::Driver::*</b> classes, because the <b>DBI</b> takes care  of
       that for you when the driver is loaded.

        *FIX ME* Explain what the imp_data_size is, so that implementors aren't
        practicing cargo-cult programming.

       The database handle constructor

       The database handle constructor is the driver's (hence the changed namespace) connect() method:

         sub connect
         {
             my ($drh, $dr_dsn, $user, $auth, $attr) = @_;

             # Some database specific verifications, default settings
             # and the like can go here. This should only include
             # syntax checks or similar stuff where it's legal to
             # 'die' in case of errors.
             # For example, many database packages requires specific
             # environment variables to be set; this could be where you
             # validate that they are set, or default them if they are not set.

             my $driver_prefix = "drv_"; # the assigned prefix for this driver

             # Process attributes from the DSN; we assume ODBC syntax
             # here, that is, the DSN looks like var1=val1;...;varN=valN
             foreach my $var ( split /;/, $dr_dsn ) {
                 my ($attr_name, $attr_value) = split '=', $var, 2;
                 return $drh-&gt;set_err($DBI::stderr, "Can't parse DSN part '$var'")
                     unless defined $attr_value;

                 # add driver prefix to attribute name if it doesn't have it already
                 $attr_name = $driver_prefix.$attr_name
                     unless $attr_name =~ /^$driver_prefix/o;

                 # Store attribute into %$attr, replacing any existing value.
                 # The DBI will STORE() these into $dbh after we've connected
                 $attr-&gt;{$attr_name} = $attr_value;
             }

             # Get the attributes we'll use to connect.
             # We use delete here because these no need to STORE them
             my $db = delete $attr-&gt;{drv_database} || delete $attr-&gt;{drv_db}
                 or return $drh-&gt;set_err($DBI::stderr, "No database name given in DSN '$dr_dsn'");
             my $host = delete $attr-&gt;{drv_host} || 'localhost';
             my $port = delete $attr-&gt;{drv_port} || 123456;

             # Assume you can attach to your database via drv_connect:
             my $connection = drv_connect($db, $host, $port, $user, $auth)
                 or return $drh-&gt;set_err($DBI::stderr, "Can't connect to $dr_dsn: ...");

             # create a 'blank' dbh (call superclass constructor)
             my ($outer, $dbh) = DBI::_new_dbh($drh, { Name =&gt; $dr_dsn });

             $dbh-&gt;STORE('Active', 1 );
             $dbh-&gt;{drv_connection} = $connection;

             return $outer;
         }

       This is mostly the same as in the <u>driver</u> <u>handle</u> <u>constructor</u> above.  The arguments are described in DBI.

       The constructor DBI::_new_dbh() is called, returning a database handle.  The constructor's prototype is:

         ($outer, $inner) = DBI::_new_dbh($drh, $public_attr, $private_attr);

       with  similar  arguments to those in the <u>driver</u> <u>handle</u> <u>constructor</u>, except that the <u>$class</u> is replaced by
       <u>$drh</u>. The <u>Name</u> attribute is a standard <b>DBI</b> attribute (see "Database Handle Attributes" in DBI).

       In scalar context, only the outer handle is returned.

       Note the use of the STORE() method for setting the <u>dbh</u> attributes.   That's  because  within  the  driver
       code,  the  handle  object  you  have is the 'inner' handle of a tied hash, not the outer handle that the
       users of your driver have.

       Because you have the inner handle, tie magic doesn't get invoked when you get or set values in the  hash.
       This  is  often  very  handy  for  speed  when  you want to get or set simple non-special driver-specific
       attributes.

       However, some attribute values, such as those handled by the <b>DBI</b> like <u>PrintError</u>, don't actually exist in
       the hash and must be read via "$h-&gt;FETCH($attrib)" and set via "$h-&gt;STORE($attrib, $value)".  If  in  any
       doubt, use these methods.

       The <b>data_sources()</b> method

       The  data_sources()  method  must  populate  and  return  a list of valid data sources, prefixed with the
       "<u>dbi:Driver</u>" incantation that allows them to be used  in  the  first  argument  of  the  "DBI-&gt;connect()"
       method.   An  example  of  this  might  be scanning the <u>$HOME/.odbcini</u> file on Unix for ODBC data sources
       (DSNs).

       As a trivial example, consider a fixed list of data sources:

         sub data_sources
         {
             my($drh, $attr) = @_;
             my(@list) = ();
             # You need more sophisticated code than this to set @list...
             push @list, "dbi:Driver:abc";
             push @list, "dbi:Driver:def";
             push @list, "dbi:Driver:ghi";
             # End of code to set @list
             return @list;
         }

       The <b>disconnect_all()</b> method

       If you need to release any resources when the driver  is  unloaded,  you  can  provide  a  disconnect_all
       method.

       Other driver handle methods

       If you need any other driver handle methods, they can follow here.

       Error handling

       It  is  quite  likely  that something fails in the connect method.  With <b>DBD::File</b> for example, you might
       catch an error when setting the current directory  to  something  not  existent  by  using  the  (driver-
       specific) <u>f_dir</u> attribute.

       To report an error, you use the set_err() method:

         $h-&gt;set_err($err, $errmsg, $state);

       This  will ensure that the error is recorded correctly and that <u>RaiseError</u> and <u>PrintError</u> etc are handled
       correctly.

       Typically you'll always use the method instance, aka your method's first argument.

       As set_err() always returns "undef" your error handling code can usually be simplified to something  like
       this:

         return $h-&gt;set_err($err, $errmsg, $state) if ...;

       <u>The</u> <u>DBD::Driver::db</u> <u>package</u>

         package DBD::Driver::db; # ====== DATABASE ======

         $DBD::Driver::db::imp_data_size = 0;

       The statement handle constructor

       There's nothing much new in the statement handle constructor, which is the prepare() method:

         sub prepare
         {
             my ($dbh, $statement, @attribs) = @_;

             # create a 'blank' sth
             my ($outer, $sth) = DBI::_new_sth($dbh, { Statement =&gt; $statement });

             $sth-&gt;STORE('NUM_OF_PARAMS', ($statement =~ tr/?//));

             $sth-&gt;{drv_params} = [];

             return $outer;
         }

       This  is  still  the  same  --  check the arguments and call the super class constructor DBI::_new_sth().
       Again, in scalar context, only the outer handle is returned. The <u>Statement</u> attribute should be cached  as
       shown.

       Note  the  prefix  <u>drv</u><b>_</b>  in  the  attribute  names: it is required that all your private attributes use a
       lowercase prefix unique to your driver.  As mentioned earlier  in  this  document,  the  <b>DBI</b>  contains  a
       registry  of  known  driver  prefixes  and  may  one  day warn about unknown attributes that don't have a
       registered prefix.

       Note that we parse the statement here  in  order  to  set  the  attribute  <u>NUM_OF_PARAMS</u>.  The  technique
       illustrated  is  not  very  reliable;  it  can be confused by question marks appearing in quoted strings,
       delimited identifiers or in SQL comments that are part of the SQL statement. We could  set  <u>NUM_OF_PARAMS</u>
       in  the  execute() method instead because the <b>DBI</b> specification explicitly allows a driver to defer this,
       but then the user could not call bind_param().

       Transaction handling

       Pure Perl drivers will rarely support transactions.  Thus  your  commit()  and  rollback()  methods  will
       typically be quite simple:

         sub commit
         {
             my ($dbh) = @_;
             if ($dbh-&gt;FETCH('Warn')) {
                 warn("Commit ineffective while AutoCommit is on");
             }
             0;
         }

         sub rollback {
             my ($dbh) = @_;
             if ($dbh-&gt;FETCH('Warn')) {
                 warn("Rollback ineffective while AutoCommit is on");
             }
             0;
         }

       Or even simpler, just use the default methods provided by the <b>DBI</b> that do nothing except return "undef".

       The <b>DBI</b>'s default begin_work() method can be used by inheritance.

       The <b>STORE()</b> and <b>FETCH()</b> methods

       These methods (that we have already used, see above) are called for you, whenever the user does a:

         $dbh-&gt;{$attr} = $val;

       or, respectively,

         $val = $dbh-&gt;{$attr};

       See perltie for details on tied hash refs to understand why these methods are required.

       The  <b>DBI</b> will handle most attributes for you, in particular attributes like <u>RaiseError</u> or <u>PrintError</u>. All
       you have to do is handle your driver's  private  attributes  and  any  attributes,  like  <u>AutoCommit</u>  and
       <u>ChopBlanks</u>, that the <b>DBI</b> can't handle for you.

       A good example might look like this:

         sub STORE
         {
             my ($dbh, $attr, $val) = @_;
             if ($attr eq 'AutoCommit') {
                 # AutoCommit is currently the only standard attribute we have
                 # to consider.
                 if (!$val) { die "Can't disable AutoCommit"; }
                 return 1;
             }
             if ($attr =~ m/^drv_/) {
                 # Handle only our private attributes here
                 # Note that we could trigger arbitrary actions.
                 # Ideally we should warn about unknown attributes.
                 $dbh-&gt;{$attr} = $val; # Yes, we are allowed to do this,
                 return 1;             # but only for our private attributes
             }
             # Else pass up to DBI to handle for us
             $dbh-&gt;SUPER::STORE($attr, $val);
         }

         sub FETCH
         {
             my ($dbh, $attr) = @_;
             if ($attr eq 'AutoCommit') { return 1; }
             if ($attr =~ m/^drv_/) {
                 # Handle only our private attributes here
                 # Note that we could trigger arbitrary actions.
                 return $dbh-&gt;{$attr}; # Yes, we are allowed to do this,
                                       # but only for our private attributes
             }
             # Else pass up to DBI to handle
             $dbh-&gt;SUPER::FETCH($attr);
         }

       The  <b>DBI</b>  will  actually  store  and  fetch driver-specific attributes (with all lowercase names) without
       warning or error, so there's actually no need to implement driver-specific any code in your  FETCH()  and
       STORE() methods unless you need extra logic/checks, beyond getting or setting the value.

       Unless  your  driver  documentation  indicates  otherwise,  the  return  value  of  the STORE() method is
       unspecified and the caller shouldn't use that value.

       Other database handle methods

       As with the driver package, other database handle methods may follow  here.   In  particular  you  should
       consider  a  (possibly  empty)  disconnect()  method and possibly a quote() method if <b>DBI</b>'s default isn't
       correct for you. You may also need the type_info_all() and get_info() methods, as described elsewhere  in
       this document.

       Where  reasonable use "$h-&gt;SUPER::foo()" to call the <b>DBI</b>'s method in some or all cases and just wrap your
       custom behavior around that.

       If you want to use private trace flags you'll probably want to be able to set them by name.  To  do  that
       you'll  need  to  define  a  parse_trace_flag()  method  (note  that's  "parse_trace_flag", singular, not
       "parse_trace_flags", plural).

         sub parse_trace_flag {
             my ($h, $name) = @_;
             return 0x01000000 if $name eq 'foo';
             return 0x02000000 if $name eq 'bar';
             return 0x04000000 if $name eq 'baz';
             return 0x08000000 if $name eq 'boo';
             return 0x10000000 if $name eq 'bop';
             return $h-&gt;SUPER::parse_trace_flag($name);
         }

       All private flag names must be lowercase, and all private flags must be in the top 8 of the 32 bits.

       <u>The</u> <u>DBD::Driver::st</u> <u>package</u>

       This package follows the same pattern the others do:

         package DBD::Driver::st;

         $DBD::Driver::st::imp_data_size = 0;

       The <b>execute()</b> and <b>bind_param()</b> methods

       This is perhaps the most difficult method because  we  have  to  consider  parameter  bindings  here.  In
       addition  to that, there are a number of statement attributes which must be set for inherited <b>DBI</b> methods
       to function correctly (see "Statement attributes" below).

       We present a simplified implementation by using the <u>drv_params</u> attribute from above:

         sub bind_param
         {
             my ($sth, $pNum, $val, $attr) = @_;
             my $type = (ref $attr) ? $attr-&gt;{TYPE} : $attr;
             if ($type) {
                 my $dbh = $sth-&gt;{Database};
                 $val = $dbh-&gt;quote($sth, $type);
             }
             my $params = $sth-&gt;{drv_params};
             $params-&gt;[$pNum-1] = $val;
             1;
         }

         sub execute
         {
             my ($sth, @bind_values) = @_;

             # start of by finishing any previous execution if still active
             $sth-&gt;finish if $sth-&gt;FETCH('Active');

             my $params = (@bind_values) ?
                 \@bind_values : $sth-&gt;{drv_params};
             my $numParam = $sth-&gt;FETCH('NUM_OF_PARAMS');
             return $sth-&gt;set_err($DBI::stderr, "Wrong number of parameters")
                 if @$params != $numParam;
             my $statement = $sth-&gt;{'Statement'};
             for (my $i = 0;  $i &lt; $numParam;  $i++) {
                 $statement =~ s/?/$params-&gt;[$i]/; # XXX doesn't deal with quoting etc!
             }
             # Do anything ... we assume that an array ref of rows is
             # created and store it:
             $sth-&gt;{'drv_data'} = $data;
             $sth-&gt;{'drv_rows'} = @$data; # number of rows
             $sth-&gt;STORE('NUM_OF_FIELDS') = $numFields;
             $sth-&gt;{Active} = 1;
             @$data || '0E0';
         }

       There are a number of things you should note here.

       We initialize the <u>NUM_OF_FIELDS</u> and <u>Active</u> attributes here, because they are essential for bind_columns()
       to work.

       We use attribute "$sth-&gt;{Statement}" which we created within prepare(). The attribute "$sth-&gt;{Database}",
       which is nothing else than the <u>dbh</u>, was automatically created by <b>DBI</b>.

       Finally, note that (as specified in the <b>DBI</b> specification) we return the  string  '0E0'  instead  of  the
       number 0, so that the result tests true but equal to zero.

         $sth-&gt;execute() or die $sth-&gt;errstr;

       The <b>execute_array()</b>, <b>execute_for_fetch()</b> and <b>bind_param_array()</b> methods

       In  general,  DBD's  only  need  to  implement  execute_for_fetch() and "bind_param_array". DBI's default
       execute_array() will invoke the DBD's execute_for_fetch() as needed.

       The  following  sequence  describes  the  interaction   between   DBI   "execute_array"   and   a   DBD's
       "execute_for_fetch":

       1.  App calls "$sth-&gt;execute_array(\%attrs, @array_of_arrays)"

       2.  If    @array_of_arrays   was   specified,   DBI   processes   @array_of_arrays   by   calling   DBD's
           bind_param_array(). Alternately, App may have directly called bind_param_array()

       3.  DBD validates and binds each array

       4.  DBI retrieves the validated param arrays from DBD's ParamArray attribute

       5.  DBI calls DBD's "execute_for_fetch($fetch_tuple_sub, \@tuple_status)", where &amp;$fetch_tuple_sub  is  a
           closure  to  iterate over the returned ParamArray values, and "\@tuple_status" is an array to receive
           the disposition status of each tuple.

       6.  DBD iteratively calls &amp;$fetch_tuple_sub to retrieve parameter tuples to be added to its bulk database
           operation/request.

       7.  when DBD reaches the limit of tuples it can handle in a single  database  operation/request,  or  the
           &amp;$fetch_tuple_sub  indicates  no more tuples by returning undef, the DBD executes the bulk operation,
           and reports the disposition of each tuple in \@tuple_status.

       8.  DBD repeats steps 6 and 7 until all tuples are processed.

       E.g., here's the essence of DBD::Oracle's execute_for_fetch:

              while (1) {
                  my @tuple_batch;
                  for (my $i = 0; $i &lt; $batch_size; $i++) {
                       push @tuple_batch, [ @{$fetch_tuple_sub-&gt;() || last} ];
                  }
                  last unless @tuple_batch;
                  my $res = ora_execute_array($sth, \@tuple_batch,
                     scalar(@tuple_batch), $tuple_batch_status);
                  push @$tuple_status, @$tuple_batch_status;
              }

       Note that DBI's default <b>execute_array()</b>/<b>execute_for_fetch()</b> implementation requires the use of positional
       (i.e., '?') placeholders. Drivers  which  <b>require</b>  named  placeholders  must  either  emulate  positional
       placeholders  (e.g.,  see  DBD::Oracle),  or must implement their own <b>execute_array()</b>/<b>execute_for_fetch()</b>
       methods to properly sequence bound parameter arrays.

       Fetching data

       Only one method needs  to  be  written  for  fetching  data,  fetchrow_arrayref().   The  other  methods,
       fetchrow_array(),  fetchall_arrayref(),  etc, as well as the database handle's "select*" methods are part
       of <b>DBI</b>, and call fetchrow_arrayref() as necessary.

         sub fetchrow_arrayref
         {
             my ($sth) = @_;
             my $data = $sth-&gt;{drv_data};
             my $row = shift @$data;
             if (!$row) {
                 $sth-&gt;STORE(Active =&gt; 0); # mark as no longer active
                 return undef;
             }
             if ($sth-&gt;FETCH('ChopBlanks')) {
                 map { $_ =~ s/\s+$//; } @$row;
             }
             return $sth-&gt;_set_fbav($row);
         }
         *fetch = \&amp;fetchrow_arrayref; # required alias for fetchrow_arrayref

       Note the use of the method _set_fbav() -- this is required so that bind_col() and bind_columns() work.

       If an error occurs which leaves the <u>$sth</u> in a state where remaining rows can't  be  fetched  then  <u>Active</u>
       should be turned off before the method returns.

       The rows() method for this driver can be implemented like this:

         sub rows { shift-&gt;{drv_rows} }

       because it knows in advance how many rows it has fetched.  Alternatively you could delete that method and
       so  fallback  to  the  <b>DBI</b>'s  own  method  which  does  the  right  thing based on the number of calls to
       _set_fbav().

       The more_results method

       If your driver doesn't support multiple result sets, then don't even implement this method.

       Otherwise, this method needs to get the statement handle ready to fetch results from the next result set,
       if there is one. Typically you'd start with:

           $sth-&gt;finish;

       then you should delete all the attributes from the attribute cache that may no longer be relevant for the
       new result set:

           delete $sth-&gt;{$_}
               for qw(NAME TYPE PRECISION SCALE ...);

       for drivers written in C use:

           hv_delete((HV*)SvRV(sth), "NAME", 4, G_DISCARD);
           hv_delete((HV*)SvRV(sth), "NULLABLE", 8, G_DISCARD);
           hv_delete((HV*)SvRV(sth), "NUM_OF_FIELDS", 13, G_DISCARD);
           hv_delete((HV*)SvRV(sth), "PRECISION", 9, G_DISCARD);
           hv_delete((HV*)SvRV(sth), "SCALE", 5, G_DISCARD);
           hv_delete((HV*)SvRV(sth), "TYPE", 4, G_DISCARD);

       Don't forget to also delete, or update, any driver-private attributes that may not  be  correct  for  the
       next resultset.

       The NUM_OF_FIELDS attribute is a special case. It should be set using STORE:

           $sth-&gt;STORE(NUM_OF_FIELDS =&gt; 0); /* for DBI &lt;= 1.53 */
           $sth-&gt;STORE(NUM_OF_FIELDS =&gt; $new_value);

       for drivers written in C use this incantation:

           /* Adjust NUM_OF_FIELDS - which also adjusts the row buffer size */
           DBIc_NUM_FIELDS(imp_sth) = 0; /* for DBI &lt;= 1.53 */
           DBIc_STATE(imp_xxh)-&gt;set_attr_k(sth, sv_2mortal(newSVpvn("NUM_OF_FIELDS",13)), 0,
               sv_2mortal(newSViv(mysql_num_fields(imp_sth-&gt;result)))
           );

       For  DBI  versions  prior to 1.54 you'll also need to explicitly adjust the number of elements in the row
       buffer array (DBIc_FIELDS_AV(imp_sth)) to match the new result set. Fill any new values with <b><a href="../man0/newSV.0.html">newSV</a></b>(0) not
       &amp;sv_undef.  Alternatively you could free DBIc_FIELDS_AV(imp_sth) and set it to null, but that would  mean
       <b>bind_columns()</b> wouldn't work across result sets.

       Statement attributes

       The main difference between <u>dbh</u> and <u>sth</u> attributes is, that you should implement a lot of attributes here
       that are required by the <b>DBI</b>, such as <u>NAME</u>, <u>NULLABLE</u>, <u>TYPE</u>, etc. See "Statement Handle Attributes" in DBI
       for a complete list.

       Pay  attention  to  attributes which are marked as read only, such as <u>NUM_OF_PARAMS</u>. These attributes can
       only be set the first time a statement is executed. If a statement is prepared,  then  executed  multiple
       times, warnings may be generated.

       You  can  protect  against  these  warnings,  and  prevent the recalculation of attributes which might be
       expensive to calculate (such as the <u>NAME</u> and <u>NAME_*</u> attributes):

           my $storedNumParams = $sth-&gt;FETCH('NUM_OF_PARAMS');
           if (!defined $storedNumParams or $storedNumFields &lt; 0) {
               $sth-&gt;STORE('NUM_OF_PARAMS') = $numParams;

               # Set other useful attributes that only need to be set once
               # for a statement, like $sth-&gt;{NAME} and $sth-&gt;{TYPE}
           }

       One particularly important attribute to set correctly (mentioned in "ATTRIBUTES COMMON TO ALL HANDLES" in
       DBI is <u>Active</u>. Many <b>DBI</b> methods, including bind_columns(), depend on this attribute.

       Besides that the STORE() and FETCH() methods are mainly the same as above for <u>dbh</u>'s.

       Other statement methods

       A trivial finish() method to  discard  stored  data,  reset  any  attributes  (such  as  <u>Active</u>)  and  do
       "$sth-&gt;SUPER::finish()".

       If you've defined a parse_trace_flag() method in <b>::db</b> you'll also want it in <b>::st</b>, so just alias it in:

         *parse_trace_flag = \&amp;DBD::foo:db::parse_trace_flag;

       And perhaps some other methods that are not part of the <b>DBI</b> specification, in particular to make metadata
       available.  Remember that they must have names that begin with your drivers registered prefix so they can
       be installed using install_method().

       If  DESTROY()  is  called  on  a  statement handle that's still active ("$sth-&gt;{Active}" is true) then it
       should effectively call finish().

           sub DESTROY {
               my $sth = shift;
               $sth-&gt;finish if $sth-&gt;FETCH('Active');
           }

   <b>Tests</b>
       The test process should conform as closely as possibly to the Perl standard test harness.

       In particular, most (all) of the tests should be run in the <u>t</u> sub-directory, and should simply produce an
       "ok" when run under "make test".  For details on how this is done, see the Camel book and the section  in
       Chapter 7, "The Standard Perl Library" on Test::Harness.

       The  tests  may  need  to  adapt  to  the  type  of  database which is being used for testing, and to the
       privileges of the user testing the driver. For example, the <b>DBD::Informix</b> test code has  to  adapt  in  a
       number  of  places  to the type of database to which it is connected as different Informix databases have
       different capabilities: some of the tests are for databases without  transaction  logs;  others  are  for
       databases  with  a  transaction  log;  some  versions  of  the  server  have support for blobs, or stored
       procedures, or user-defined data types, and others do not.

       When a complete file of tests must be skipped, you can provide a reason in a pseudo-comment:

           if ($no_transactions_available)
           {
               print "1..0 # Skip: No transactions available\n";
               exit 0;
           }

       Consider downloading the <b>DBD::Informix</b> code and look at the code in <u>DBD/Informix/TestHarness.pm</u> which  is
       used throughout the <b>DBD::Informix</b> tests in the <u>t</u> sub-directory.

</pre><h4><b>CREATING</b> <b>A</b> <b>C/XS</b> <b>DRIVER</b></h4><pre>
       Please  also  see  the  section  under  "CREATING  A  PURE  PERL  DRIVER"  regarding  the creation of the
       <u>Makefile.PL</u>.

       Creating a new C/XS driver from scratch will always be a daunting  task.   You  can  and  should  greatly
       simplify  your  task  by  taking  a  good reference driver implementation and modifying that to match the
       database product for which you are writing a driver.

       The de facto reference driver has been the one for <b>DBD::Oracle</b> written by Tim  Bunce,  who  is  also  the
       author  of  the  <b>DBI</b>  package.  The <b>DBD::Oracle</b> module is a good example of a driver implemented around a
       C-level API.

       Nowadays it it seems better to base on <b>DBD::ODBC</b>, another driver  maintained  by  Tim  and  Jeff  Urlwin,
       because  it  offers a lot of metadata and seems to become the guideline for the future development. (Also
       as <b>DBD::Oracle</b> digs deeper into the Oracle 8 OCI interface it'll get even more hairy than it is now.)

       The <b>DBD::Informix</b> driver is one driver implemented using embedded SQL instead of  a  function-based  API.
       <b>DBD::Ingres</b> may also be worth a look.

   <b>C/XS</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Driver.pm</b>
       A  lot  of  the code in the <u>Driver.pm</u> file is very similar to the code for pure Perl modules - see above.
       However, there are also some subtle (and not so subtle) differences, including:

       •       The variables <u>$DBD::Driver::{dr|db|st}::imp_data_size</u> are not defined here, but in the  XS  code,
               because they declare the size of certain C structures.

       •       Some   methods  are  typically  moved  to  the  XS  code,  in  particular  prepare(),  execute(),
               disconnect(), disconnect_all() and the STORE() and FETCH() methods.

       •       Other methods are still part of <u>Driver.pm</u>, but have callbacks to the XS code.

       •       If the driver-specific parts of the <u>imp_drh_t</u> structure need to be  formally  initialized  (which
               does  not  seem  to  be  a  common requirement), then you need to add a call to an appropriate XS
               function in the driver method of DBD::Driver::driver(), and you define the corresponding function
               in <u>Driver.xs</u>, and you define the C code in <u>dbdimp.c</u> and the prototype in <u>dbdimp.h</u>.

               For example, <b>DBD::Informix</b> has such a requirement, and adds the following call after the call  to
               _new_drh() in <u>Informix.pm</u>:

                 DBD::Informix::dr::driver_init($drh);

               and the following code in <u>Informix.xs</u>:

                 # Initialize the DBD::Informix driver data structure
                 void
                 driver_init(drh)
                     SV *drh
                     CODE:
                     <a href="../man0/ST.0.html">ST</a>(0) = dbd_ix_dr_driver_init(drh) ? &amp;sv_yes : &amp;sv_no;

               and the code in <u>dbdimp.h</u> declares:

                 extern int dbd_ix_dr_driver_init(SV *drh);

               and the code in <u>dbdimp.ec</u> (equivalent to <u>dbdimp.c</u>) defines:

                 /* Formally initialize the DBD::Informix driver structure */
                 int
                 dbd_ix_dr_driver(SV *drh)
                 {
                     D_imp_drh(drh);
                     imp_drh-&gt;n_connections = 0;       /* No active connections */
                     imp_drh-&gt;current_connection = 0;  /* No current connection */
                     imp_drh-&gt;multipleconnections = (ESQLC_VERSION &gt;= 600) ? True : False;
                     dbd_ix_link_newhead(&amp;imp_drh-&gt;head);  /* Empty linked list of connections */
                     return 1;
                 }

               <b>DBD::Oracle</b>  has  a  similar  requirement but gets around it by checking whether the private data
               part of the driver handle is all zeroed out, rather than add extra functions.

       Now let's take a closer look at an excerpt from <u>Oracle.pm</u> (revised heavily to remove  idiosyncrasies)  as
       an example, ignoring things that were already discussed for pure Perl drivers.

       <u>The</u> <u>connect</u> <u>method</u>

       The  connect  method  is the database handle constructor.  You could write either of two versions of this
       method: either one which takes connection attributes (new code) and one  which  ignores  them  (old  code
       only).

       If  you  ignore  the  connection  attributes, then you omit all mention of the <u>$auth</u> variable (which is a
       reference to a hash of attributes), and the XS system manages the differences for you.

         sub connect
         {
             my ($drh, $dbname, $user, $auth, $attr) = @_;

             # Some database specific verifications, default settings
             # and the like following here. This should only include
             # syntax checks or similar stuff where it's legal to
             # 'die' in case of errors.

             my $dbh = DBI::_new_dbh($drh, {
                     'Name'   =&gt; $dbname,
                 })
                 or return undef;

             # Call the driver-specific function _login in Driver.xs file which
             # calls the DBMS-specific function(s) to connect to the database,
             # and populate internal handle data.
             DBD::Driver::db::_login($dbh, $dbname, $user, $auth, $attr)
                 or return undef;

             $dbh;
         }

       This is mostly the same as in the pure Perl case, the exception being the use  of  the  private  _login()
       callback, which is the function that will really connect to the database. It is implemented in <u>Driver.xst</u>
       (you  should  not  implement it) and calls dbd_db_login6() or "dbd_db_login6_sv" from <u>dbdimp.c</u>. See below
       for details.

       If your driver has driver-specific attributes which may be passed in the connect method and hence end  up
       in $attr in "dbd_db_login6" then it is best to delete any you process so DBI does not send them again via
       STORE after connect. You can do this in C like this:

         DBD_ATTRIB_DELETE(attr, "my_attribute_name",
                           strlen("my_attribute_name"));

       However,  prior to DBI subversion version 11605 (and fixed post 1.607) DBD_ATTRIB_DELETE segfaulted so if
       you cannot guarantee the DBI version will be post 1.607 you need to use:

         hv_delete((HV*)SvRV(attr), "my_attribute_name",
                            strlen("my_attribute_name"), G_DISCARD);

        *FIX ME* Discuss removing attributes in Perl code.

       <u>The</u> <u>disconnect_all</u> <u>method</u>

        *FIX ME* T.B.S

       <u>The</u> <u>data_sources</u> <u>method</u>

       If your data_sources() method can be implemented in pure Perl, then do so because it is easier than doing
       it in XS code (see the section above for pure Perl drivers).

       If your data_sources()  method  must  call  onto  compiled  functions,  then  you  will  need  to  define
       <u>dbd_dr_data_sources</u>  in  your  <u>dbdimp.h</u>  file, which will trigger <u>Driver.xst</u> (in <b>DBI</b> v1.33 or greater) to
       generate the XS code that calls your actual C function (see the discussion below for details) and you  do
       not code anything in <u>Driver.pm</u> to handle it.

       <u>The</u> <u>prepare</u> <u>method</u>

       The  prepare  method  is  the statement handle constructor, and most of it is not new. Like the connect()
       method, it now has a C callback:

         package DBD::Driver::db; # ====== DATABASE ======
         use strict;

         sub prepare
         {
             my ($dbh, $statement, $attribs) = @_;

             # create a 'blank' sth
             my $sth = DBI::_new_sth($dbh, {
                 'Statement' =&gt; $statement,
                 })
                 or return undef;

             # Call the driver-specific function _prepare in Driver.xs file
             # which calls the DBMS-specific function(s) to prepare a statement
             # and populate internal handle data.
             DBD::Driver::st::_prepare($sth, $statement, $attribs)
                 or return undef;
             $sth;
         }

        *FIX ME* T.B.S

       <u>Other</u> <u>methods?</u>

        *FIX ME* T.B.S

   <b>Driver.xs</b>
       <u>Driver.xs</u> should look something like this:

         #include "Driver.h"

         DBISTATE_DECLARE;

         INCLUDE: Driver.xsi

         MODULE = DBD::Driver    PACKAGE = DBD::Driver::dr

         /* Non-standard drh XS methods following here, if any.       */
         /* If none (the usual case), omit the MODULE line above too. */

         MODULE = DBD::Driver    PACKAGE = DBD::Driver::db

         /* Non-standard dbh XS methods following here, if any.       */
         /* Currently this includes things like _list_tables from     */
         /* DBD::mSQL and DBD::mysql.                                 */

         MODULE = DBD::Driver    PACKAGE = DBD::Driver::st

         /* Non-standard sth XS methods following here, if any.       */
         /* In particular this includes things like _list_fields from */
         /* DBD::mSQL and DBD::mysql for accessing metadata.          */

       Note especially the include of <u>Driver.xsi</u> here: <b>DBI</b> inserts stub functions for almost all private methods
       here which will typically do much work for you.

       Wherever you really have to implement something, it will call a private function in <u>dbdimp.c</u>, and this is
       what you have to implement.

       You need to set up an extra routine if your driver needs to export constants of its own, analogous to the
       SQL types available when you say:

         use DBI qw(:sql_types);

        *FIX ME* T.B.S

   <b>Driver.h</b>
       <u>Driver.h</u> is very simple and the operational contents should look like this:

         #ifndef DRIVER_H_INCLUDED
         #define DRIVER_H_INCLUDED

         #define NEED_DBIXS_VERSION 93    /* 93 for DBI versions 1.00 to 1.51+ */
         #define PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT      /* if used require DBI 1.51+ */

         #include &lt;DBIXS.h&gt;      /* installed by the DBI module  */

         #include "dbdimp.h"

         #include "dbivport.h"   /* see below                    */

         #include &lt;dbd_xsh.h&gt;    /* installed by the DBI module  */

         #endif /* DRIVER_H_INCLUDED */

       The <u>DBIXS.h</u> header defines most of the interesting information that the writer of a driver needs.

       The file <u>dbd_xsh.h</u> header provides prototype declarations for the C functions that you  might  decide  to
       implement.  Note  that  you  should  normally  only  define  one  of  dbd_db_login(),  dbd_db_login6() or
       "dbd_db_login6_sv" unless you are intent on supporting really old versions of <b>DBI</b> (prior to <b>DBI</b> 1.06)  as
       well  as  modern  versions.  The  only  standard,  <b>DBI</b>-mandated  functions  that you need write are those
       specified in the <u>dbd_xsh.h</u> header. You might also add extra driver-specific functions in <u>Driver.xs</u>.

       The <u>dbivport.h</u> file should be <u>copied</u> from the latest <b>DBI</b> release into your  distribution  each  time  you
       modify  your  driver.  Its job is to allow you to enhance your code to work with the latest <b>DBI</b> API while
       still allowing your driver to be compiled and used with older versions of the <b>DBI</b> (for example, when  the
       DBIh_SET_ERR_CHAR()  macro was added to <b>DBI</b> 1.41, an emulation of it was added to <u>dbivport.h</u>). This makes
       users happy and your life easier. Always read the notes in <u>dbivport.h</u> to check for any limitations in the
       emulation that you should be aware of.

       With <b>DBI</b> v1.51 or better I recommend that  the  driver  defines  <u>PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT</u>  before  <u>DBIXS.h</u>  is
       included.  This  can significantly improve efficiency when running under a thread enabled perl. (Remember
       that the standard perl in most Linux distributions is built with threads enabled.  So is ActiveState perl
       for Windows, and perl built for Apache mod_perl2.)  If you do this there are some things to keep in mind:

       •   If <u>PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT</u> is defined, then every function that calls the Perl API will need to start out
           with a "dTHX;" declaration.

       •   You'll know which functions need this, because the C  compiler  will  complain  that  the  undeclared
           identifier  "my_perl"  is  used if <u>and</u> <u>only</u> <u>if</u> the perl you are using to develop and test your driver
           has threads enabled.

       •   If you don't remember to test with a thread-enabled perl before making a  release  it's  likely  that
           you'll get failure reports from users who are.

       •   For  driver  private  functions it is possible to gain even more efficiency by replacing "dTHX;" with
           "pTHX_" prepended to the parameter list and then "aTHX_" prepended to the  argument  list  where  the
           function is called.

       See  "How  multiple  interpreters  and  concurrency are supported" in perlguts for additional information
       about <u>PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT</u>.

   <b>Implementation</b> <b>header</b> <b>dbdimp.h</b>
       This header file has two jobs:

       First it defines data structures for your private part of the handles.  Note that the DBI  provides  many
       common  fields  for you. For example the statement handle (imp_sth) already has a row_count field with an
       IV type that accessed via the DBIc_ROW_COUNT(imp_sth) macro. Using this is strongly recommended  as  it's
       built  in  to  some  DBI  internals so the DBI can 'just work' in more cases and you'll have less driver-
       specific code to write.  Study DBIXS.h to see what's included with each type of handle.

       Second it defines macros that rename the generic names like dbd_db_login()  to  database  specific  names
       like  ora_db_login().  This avoids name clashes and enables use of different drivers when you work with a
       statically linked perl.

       It also will have the important task of disabling XS methods that you don't want to implement.

       Finally, the macros will also be used to select alternate implementations of some functions. For example,
       the dbd_db_login() function is not passed the attribute hash.

       Since <b>DBI</b> v1.06, if a dbd_db_login6() macro is defined (for a function with 6 arguments), it will be used
       instead with the attribute hash passed as the sixth argument.

       Since <b>DBI</b> post v1.607, if a dbd_db_login6_sv() macro is defined (for a function  like  dbd_db_login6  but
       with  scalar  pointers  for  the dbname, username and password), it will be used instead. This will allow
       your login6 function to see if there are any Unicode characters in the dbname.

       Similarly defining dbd_db_do4_iv is preferred  over  dbd_db_do4,  dbd_st_rows_iv  over  dbd_st_rows,  and
       dbd_st_execute_iv  over  dbd_st_execute.  The *_iv forms are declared to return the IV type instead of an
       int.

       People used to just pick Oracle's <u>dbdimp.c</u> and use the same  names,  structures  and  types.  I  strongly
       recommend  against  that. At first glance this saves time, but your implementation will be less readable.
       It was just hell when I had to separate <b>DBI</b> specific parts, Oracle specific parts,  mSQL  specific  parts
       and mysql specific parts in <b>DBD::mysql</b>'s <u>dbdimp.h</u> and <u>dbdimp.c</u>. (<b>DBD::mysql</b> was a port of <b>DBD::mSQL</b> which
       was based on <b>DBD::Oracle</b>.) [Seconded, based on the experience taking <b>DBD::Informix</b> apart, even though the
       version inherited in 1996 was only based on <b>DBD::Oracle</b>.]

       This  part  of the driver is <u>your</u> <u>exclusive</u> <u>part</u>. Rewrite it from scratch, so it will be clean and short:
       in other words, a better piece of code. (Of course keep an eye on other people's work.)

         struct imp_drh_st {
             dbih_drc_t com;           /* MUST be first element in structure   */
             /* Insert your driver handle attributes here */
         };

         struct imp_dbh_st {
             dbih_dbc_t com;           /* MUST be first element in structure   */
             /* Insert your database handle attributes here */
         };

         struct imp_sth_st {
             dbih_stc_t com;           /* MUST be first element in structure   */
             /* Insert your statement handle attributes here */
         };

         /*  Rename functions for avoiding name clashes; prototypes are  */
         /*  in dbd_xsh.h                                                */
         #define dbd_init            drv_dr_init
         #define dbd_db_login6_sv    drv_db_login_sv
         #define dbd_db_do           drv_db_do
         ... many more here ...

       These structures implement your private part of the handles.

       You  <u>have</u>  to  use  the   name   "imp_dbh_{dr|db|st}"   and   the   first   field   <u>must</u>   be   of   type
       <u>dbih_drc_t|_dbc_t|_stc_t</u> and <u>must</u> be called "com".

       You should never access these fields directly, except by using the <u><b>DBIc_xxx()</b></u> macros below.

   <b>Implementation</b> <b>source</b> <b>dbdimp.c</b>
       Conventionally,  <u>dbdimp.c</u>  is  the main implementation file (but <b>DBD::Informix</b> calls the file <u>dbdimp.ec</u>).
       This section includes a short note on each function that is used in the <u>Driver.xsi</u> template and thus  <u>has</u>
       to be implemented.

       Of course, you will probably also need to implement other support functions, which should usually be file
       static if they are placed in <u>dbdimp.c</u>. If they are placed in other files, you need to list those files in
       <u>Makefile.PL</u> (and <u>MANIFEST</u>) to handle them correctly.

       It  is wise to adhere to a namespace convention for your functions to avoid conflicts. For example, for a
       driver with prefix <u>drv</u><b>_</b>, you might call externally visible functions <u>dbd_drv_xxxx</u>. You should also  avoid
       non-constant global variables as much as possible to improve the support for threading.

       Since  Perl  requires  support for function prototypes (ANSI or ISO or Standard C), you should write your
       code using function prototypes too.

       It is possible to use either the  unmapped  names  such  as  dbd_init()  or  the  mapped  names  such  as
       dbd_ix_dr_init()  in  the  <u>dbdimp.c</u>  file.   <b>DBD::Informix</b> uses the mapped names which makes it easier to
       identify where to look for linkage problems at runtime (which will report errors using the mapped names).

       Most other drivers, and in particular <b>DBD::Oracle</b>, use the unmapped names in the source code which  makes
       it  a  little  easier  to compare code between drivers and eases discussions on the <u>dbi-dev</u> mailing list.
       The majority of the code fragments here will use the unmapped names.

       Ultimately, you should provide implementations for most of the functions listed in the <u>dbd_xsh.h</u>  header.
       The  exceptions  are  optional  functions  (such  as  dbd_st_rows()) and those functions with alternative
       signatures, such  as  "dbd_db_login6_sv",  dbd_db_login6()  and  <u><b>dbd_db_login()</b></u>.  Then  you  should  only
       implement one of the alternatives, and generally the newer one of the alternatives.

       <u>The</u> <u>dbd_init</u> <u>method</u>

         #include "Driver.h"

         DBISTATE_DECLARE;

         void dbd_init(dbistate_t* dbistate)
         {
             DBISTATE_INIT;  /*  Initialize the DBI macros  */
         }

       The  dbd_init()  function  will  be  called  when  your  driver is first loaded; the bootstrap command in
       DBD::Driver::dr::driver() triggers this, and the call is generated in the  <u>BOOT</u>  section  of  <u>Driver.xst</u>.
       These  statements  are needed to allow your driver to use the <b>DBI</b> macros.  They will include your private
       header file <u>dbdimp.h</u> in turn.  Note that <u>DBISTATE_INIT</u> requires the name of the argument to dbd_init() to
       be called dbistate().

       <u>The</u> <u>dbd_drv_error</u> <u>method</u>

       You need a function to record errors so <b>DBI</b> can access them properly.  You can call it whatever you like,
       but we'll call it dbd_drv_error() here.

       The argument list depends on your database software; different systems provide different ways to  get  at
       error information.

         static void dbd_drv_error(SV *h, int rc, const char *what)
         {

       Note that <u>h</u> is a generic handle, may it be a driver handle, a database or a statement handle.

             D_imp_xxh(h);

       This  macro will declare and initialize a variable <u>imp_xxh</u> with a pointer to your private handle pointer.
       You may cast this to to <u>imp_drh_t</u>, <u>imp_dbh_t</u> or <u>imp_sth_t</u>.

       To record the error correctly, equivalent to the set_err() method, use one of the  DBIh_SET_ERR_CHAR(...)
       or DBIh_SET_ERR_SV(...) macros, which were added in <b>DBI</b> 1.41:

         DBIh_SET_ERR_SV(h, imp_xxh, err, errstr, state, method);
         DBIh_SET_ERR_CHAR(h, imp_xxh, err_c, err_i, errstr, state, method);

       For  "DBIh_SET_ERR_SV"  the <u>err</u>, <u>errstr</u>, <u>state</u>, and <u>method</u> parameters are "SV*" (use &amp;sv_undef instead of
       NULL).

       For "DBIh_SET_ERR_CHAR" the <u>err_c</u>, <u>errstr</u>, <u>state</u>, <u>method</u> parameters are "char*".

       The <u>err_i</u> parameter is an "IV" that's used instead of <u>err_c</u> if <u>err_c</u> is "Null".

       The <u>method</u> parameter can be ignored.

       The "DBIh_SET_ERR_CHAR" macro is usually the simplest to use when you just have an integer error code and
       an error message string:

         DBIh_SET_ERR_CHAR(h, imp_xxh, Nullch, rc, what, Nullch, Nullch);

       As you can see, any parameters that aren't relevant to you can be "Null".

       To make drivers compatible with <b>DBI</b> &lt; 1.41 you should be using  <u>dbivport.h</u>  as  described  in  "Driver.h"
       above.

       The (obsolete) macros such as "DBIh_EVENT2" should be removed from drivers.

       The  names  "dbis"  and "DBIS", which were used in previous versions of this document, should be replaced
       with the DBIc_DBISTATE(imp_xxh) macro.

       The name "DBILOGFP", which was also used in previous versions of this document,  should  be  replaced  by
       DBIc_LOGPIO(imp_xxh).

       Your code should not call the C "&lt;stdio.h&gt;" I/O functions; you should use PerlIO_printf() as shown:

             if (DBIc_TRACE_LEVEL(imp_xxh) &gt;= 2)
                 PerlIO_printf(DBIc_LOGPIO(imp_xxh), "foobar %s: %s\n",
                     foo, neatsvpv(errstr,0));

       That's the first time we see how tracing works within a <b>DBI</b> driver. Make use of this as often as you can,
       but don't output anything at a trace level less than 3. Levels 1 and 2 are reserved for the <b>DBI</b>.

       You  can  define  up  to  8  private  trace flags using the top 8 bits of DBIc_TRACE_FLAGS(imp), that is:
       0xFF000000. See the parse_trace_flag() method elsewhere in this document.

       <u>The</u> <u>dbd_dr_data_sources</u> <u>method</u>

       This method is optional; the support for it was added in <b>DBI</b> v1.33.

       As noted in the discussion of <u>Driver.pm</u>, if the data sources can be determined by pure Perl code,  do  it
       that  way.  If,  as  in <b>DBD::Informix</b>, the information is obtained by a C function call, then you need to
       define a function that matches the prototype:

         extern AV *dbd_dr_data_sources(SV *drh, imp_drh_t *imp_drh, SV *attrs);

       An outline implementation for <b>DBD::Informix</b> follows, assuming that the  sqgetdbs()  function  call  shown
       will  return  up to 100 databases names, with the pointers to each name in the array dbsname and the name
       strings themselves being stores in dbsarea.

         AV *dbd_dr_data_sources(SV *drh, imp_drh_t *imp_drh, SV *attr)
         {
             int ndbs;
             int i;
             char *dbsname[100];
             char  dbsarea[10000];
             AV *av = Nullav;

             if (sqgetdbs(&amp;ndbs, dbsname, 100, dbsarea, sizeof(dbsarea)) == 0)
             {
                 av = NewAV();
                 av_extend(av, (I32)ndbs);
                 sv_2mortal((SV *)av);
                 for (i = 0; i &lt; ndbs; i++)
                   av_store(av, i, newSVpvf("dbi:Informix:%s", dbsname[i]));
             }
             return(av);
         }

       The actual <b>DBD::Informix</b> implementation has a number of extra lines of  code,  logs  function  entry  and
       exit, reports the error from sqgetdbs(), and uses "#define"'d constants for the array sizes.

       <u>The</u> <u>dbd_db_login6</u> <u>method</u>

         int dbd_db_login6_sv(SV* dbh, imp_dbh_t* imp_dbh, SV* dbname,
                              SV* user, SV* auth, SV *attr);

         or

         int dbd_db_login6(SV* dbh, imp_dbh_t* imp_dbh, char* dbname,
                          char* user, char* auth, SV *attr);

       This  function  will  really connect to the database. The argument <u>dbh</u> is the database handle. <u>imp_dbh</u> is
       the pointer to the handles private data, as is <u>imp_xxx</u> in dbd_drv_error() above.  The  arguments  <u>dbname</u>,
       <u>user</u>, <u>auth</u> and <u>attr</u> correspond to the arguments of the driver handle's connect() method.

       You  will  quite  often use database specific attributes here, that are specified in the DSN. I recommend
       you parse the DSN (using Perl) within the connect() method and pass the  segments  of  the  DSN  via  the
       attributes parameter through _login() to dbd_db_login6().

       Here's how you fetch them; as an example we use <u>hostname</u> attribute, which can be up to 12 characters long
       excluding null terminator:

         SV** svp;
         STRLEN len;
         char* hostname;

         if ( (svp = DBD_ATTRIB_GET_SVP(attr, "drv_hostname", 12)) &amp;&amp; SvTRUE(*svp)) {
             hostname = SvPV(*svp, len);
             DBD_ATTRIB_DELETE(attr, "drv_hostname", 12); /* avoid later STORE */
         } else {
             hostname = "localhost";
         }

       If you handle any driver specific attributes in the dbd_db_login6 method you probably want to delete them
       from  "attr" (as above with DBD_ATTRIB_DELETE). If you don't delete your handled attributes DBI will call
       "STORE" for each attribute after the connect/login and this is at best redundant for attributes you  have
       already processed.

       <b>Note:</b>  <b>Until</b> <b>revision</b> <b>11605</b> <b>(post</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>1.607),</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>DBD_ATTRIBUTE_DELETE</b> <b>so</b> <b>unless</b> <b>you</b>
       <b>require</b> <b>a</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>version</b> <b>after</b> <b>1.607</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>each</b> <b>DBD_ATTRIBUTE_DELETE</b> <b>call</b> <b>with:</b>

         hv_delete((HV*)SvRV(attr), key, key_len, G_DISCARD)

       Note that you can also obtain standard attributes such as <u>AutoCommit</u> and <u>ChopBlanks</u> from  the  attributes
       parameter, using "DBD_ATTRIB_GET_IV" for integer attributes.

       If,  for  example,  your  database  does  not  support transactions but <u>AutoCommit</u> is set off (requesting
       transaction support), then you can emulate a 'failure to connect'.

       Now you should really connect to the database. In general, if the connection fails, it is best to  ensure
       that all allocated resources are released so that the handle does not need to be destroyed separately. If
       you  are successful (and possibly even if you fail but you have allocated some resources), you should use
       the following macros:

         DBIc_IMPSET_on(imp_dbh);

       This indicates that the driver (implementor) has allocated resources in the <u>imp_dbh</u>  structure  and  that
       the implementors private dbd_db_destroy() function should be called when the handle is destroyed.

         DBIc_ACTIVE_on(imp_dbh);

       This  indicates  that  the handle has an active connection to the server and that the dbd_db_disconnect()
       function should be called before the handle is destroyed.

       Note that if you do need to fail, you should report errors via the <u>drh</u> or <u>imp_drh</u> rather than via <u>dbh</u>  or
       <u>imp_dbh</u>  because  <u>imp_dbh</u> will be destroyed by the failure, so errors recorded in that handle will not be
       visible to <b>DBI</b>, and hence not the user either.

       Note too, that the function is passed <u>dbh</u> and <u>imp_dbh</u>, and there is a  macro  "D_imp_drh_from_dbh"  which
       can  recover  the  <u>imp_drh</u>  from  the <u>imp_dbh</u>. However, there is no <b>DBI</b> macro to provide you with the <u>drh</u>
       given either the <u>imp_dbh</u> or the <u>dbh</u> or the <u>imp_drh</u> (and there's no way to recover the <u>dbh</u> given just  the
       <u>imp_dbh</u>).

       This  suggests  that, despite the above notes about dbd_drv_error() taking an "SV *", it may be better to
       have two error routines, one taking <u>imp_dbh</u> and one taking <u>imp_drh</u> instead. With  care,  you  can  factor
       most  of  the  formatting code out so that these are small routines calling a common error formatter. See
       the code in <b>DBD::Informix</b> 1.05.00 for more information.

       The dbd_db_login6() function should return <u>TRUE</u> for success, <u>FALSE</u> otherwise.

       Drivers  implemented  long  ago  may  define  the  five-argument  function  dbd_db_login()   instead   of
       dbd_db_login6().  The  missing  argument  is  the  attributes.  There are ways to work around the missing
       attributes, but they are ungainly; it is much better to use the 6-argument form.  Even later drivers will
       use dbd_db_login6_sv() which provides the dbname, username and password as SVs.

       <u>The</u> <u>dbd_db_commit</u> <u>and</u> <u>dbd_db_rollback</u> <u>methods</u>

         int dbd_db_commit(SV *dbh, imp_dbh_t *imp_dbh);
         int dbd_db_rollback(SV* dbh, imp_dbh_t* imp_dbh);

       These are used for commit and rollback. They should return <u>TRUE</u> for success, <u>FALSE</u> for error.

       The arguments <u>dbh</u> and <u>imp_dbh</u> are the same as for dbd_db_login6() above; I will omit describing  them  in
       what follows, as they appear always.

       These functions should return <u>TRUE</u> for success, <u>FALSE</u> otherwise.

       <u>The</u> <u>dbd_db_disconnect</u> <u>method</u>

       This  is  your  private  part  of  the  disconnect()  method.  Any  <u>dbh</u>  with  the <u>ACTIVE</u> flag on must be
       disconnected. (Note that you have to set it in dbd_db_connect() above.)

         int dbd_db_disconnect(SV* dbh, imp_dbh_t* imp_dbh);

       The database handle will return <u>TRUE</u> for success, <u>FALSE</u> otherwise.  In any case it should do a:

         DBIc_ACTIVE_off(imp_dbh);

       before returning so <b>DBI</b> knows that dbd_db_disconnect() was executed.

       Note that there's nothing to stop a <u>dbh</u> being <u>disconnected</u> while it still have active children.  If  your
       database  API  reacts  badly  to trying to use an <u>sth</u> in this situation then you'll need to add code like
       this to all <u>sth</u> methods:

         if (!DBIc_ACTIVE(DBIc_PARENT_COM(imp_sth)))
           return 0;

       Alternatively, you can add code to your driver to keep explicit track of the statement handles that exist
       for each database handle and arrange to destroy those handles before  disconnecting  from  the  database.
       There  is  code to do this in <b>DBD::Informix</b>. Similar comments apply to the driver handle keeping track of
       all the database handles.

       Note that the code which destroys the subordinate handles should only  release  the  associated  database
       resources and mark the handles inactive; it does not attempt to free the actual handle structures.

       This  function  should return <u>TRUE</u> for success, <u>FALSE</u> otherwise, but it is not clear what anything can do
       about a failure.

       <u>The</u> <u>dbd_db_discon_all</u> <u>method</u>

         int dbd_discon_all (SV *drh, imp_drh_t *imp_drh);

       This function may be called at shutdown time. It should make  best-efforts  to  disconnect  all  database
       handles  -  if  possible.  Some databases don't support that, in which case you can do nothing but return
       'success'.

       This function should return <u>TRUE</u> for success, <u>FALSE</u> otherwise, but it is not clear what anything  can  do
       about a failure.

       <u>The</u> <u>dbd_db_destroy</u> <u>method</u>

       This  is  your  private  part  of the database handle destructor. Any <u>dbh</u> with the <u>IMPSET</u> flag on must be
       destroyed, so that you can safely free resources. (Note that you  have  to  set  it  in  dbd_db_connect()
       above.)

         void dbd_db_destroy(SV* dbh, imp_dbh_t* imp_dbh)
         {
             DBIc_IMPSET_off(imp_dbh);
         }

       The  <b>DBI</b>  <u>Driver.xst</u>  code will have called dbd_db_disconnect() for you, if the handle is still 'active',
       before calling dbd_db_destroy().

       Before returning the function must switch <u>IMPSET</u> to off, so <b>DBI</b> knows that the destructor was called.

       A <b>DBI</b> handle doesn't keep references to its children. But children do keep references to  their  parents.
       So a database handle won't be "DESTROY"'d until all its children have been "DESTROY"'d.

       <u>The</u> <u>dbd_db_STORE_attrib</u> <u>method</u>

       This function handles

         $dbh-&gt;{$key} = $value;

       Its prototype is:

         int dbd_db_STORE_attrib(SV* dbh, imp_dbh_t* imp_dbh, SV* keysv,
                                 SV* valuesv);

       You  do not handle all attributes; on the contrary, you should not handle <b>DBI</b> attributes here: leave this
       to <b>DBI</b>. (There are two exceptions, <u>AutoCommit</u> and <u>ChopBlanks</u>, which you should care about.)

       The return value is <u>TRUE</u> if you have handled the attribute or <u>FALSE</u> otherwise. If  you  are  handling  an
       attribute  and something fails, you should call dbd_drv_error(), so <b>DBI</b> can raise exceptions, if desired.
       If dbd_drv_error() returns, however, you have a problem: the  user  will  never  know  about  the  error,
       because he typically will not check "$dbh-&gt;errstr()".

       I  cannot  recommend  a general way of going on, if dbd_drv_error() returns, but there are examples where
       even the <b>DBI</b> specification expects that you croak(). (See the <u>AutoCommit</u> method in DBI.)

       If you have to store attributes, you should either use your private data structure  <u>imp_xxx</u>,  the  handle
       hash (via "(HV*)SvRV(dbh)"), or use the private <u>imp_data</u>.

       The first is best for internal C values like integers or pointers and where speed is important within the
       driver.  The  handle hash is best for values the user may want to get/set via driver-specific attributes.
       The private <u>imp_data</u> is an additional "SV" attached to the handle. You could think of it  as  an  unnamed
       handle attribute. It's not normally used.

       <u>The</u> <u>dbd_db_FETCH_attrib</u> <u>method</u>

       This is the counterpart of dbd_db_STORE_attrib(), needed for:

         $value = $dbh-&gt;{$key};

       Its prototype is:

         SV* dbd_db_FETCH_attrib(SV* dbh, imp_dbh_t* imp_dbh, SV* keysv);

       Unlike  all  previous  methods this returns an "SV" with the value. Note that you should normally execute
       sv_2mortal(), if you return a nonconstant value. (Constant values are &amp;sv_undef, &amp;sv_no and &amp;sv_yes.)

       Note, that <b>DBI</b> implements a caching algorithm for attribute values.  If you think, that an attribute  may
       be fetched, you store it in the <u>dbh</u> itself:

         if (cacheit) /* cache value for later DBI 'quick' fetch? */
             hv_store((HV*)SvRV(dbh), key, kl, cachesv, 0);

       <u>The</u> <u>dbd_st_prepare</u> <u>method</u>

       This  is  the  private  part of the prepare() method. Note that you <b>must</b> <b>not</b> really execute the statement
       here. You may, however, preparse and validate the statement, or do similar things.

         int dbd_st_prepare(SV* sth, imp_sth_t* imp_sth, char* statement,
                            SV* attribs);

       A typical, simple, possibility is to do nothing and  rely  on  the  perl  prepare()  code  that  set  the
       <u>Statement</u> attribute on the handle. This attribute can then be used by dbd_st_execute().

       If  the  driver  supports  placeholders  then  the  <u>NUM_OF_PARAMS</u>  attribute  must  be  set  correctly by
       dbd_st_prepare():

         DBIc_NUM_PARAMS(imp_sth) = ...

       If you can, you should also setup attributes like <u>NUM_OF_FIELDS</u>, <u>NAME</u>, etc. here, but <b>DBI</b> doesn't require
       that - they can be deferred until <b>execute()</b> is called. However, if you do, document it.

       In any case you should set the <u>IMPSET</u> flag, as you did in dbd_db_connect() above:

         DBIc_IMPSET_on(imp_sth);

       <u>The</u> <u>dbd_st_execute</u> <u>method</u>

       This is where a statement will really be executed.

         int dbd_st_execute(SV* sth, imp_sth_t* imp_sth);

       "dbd_st_execute" should return -2 for any error, -1 if the number of rows affected  is  unknown  else  it
       should be the number of affected (updated, inserted) rows.

       Note  that  you  must  be aware a statement may be executed repeatedly.  Also, you should not expect that
       finish() will be called between two executions, so you might need code,  like  the  following,  near  the
       start of the function:

         if (DBIc_ACTIVE(imp_sth))
             dbd_st_finish(h, imp_sth);

       If  your driver supports the binding of parameters (it should!), but the database doesn't, you must do it
       here. This can be done as follows:

         SV *svp;
         char* statement = DBD_ATTRIB_GET_PV(h, "Statement", 9, svp, "");
         int numParam = DBIc_NUM_PARAMS(imp_sth);
         int i;

         for (i = 0; i &lt; numParam; i++)
         {
             char* value = dbd_db_get_param(sth, imp_sth, i);
             /* It is your drivers task to implement dbd_db_get_param,    */
             /* it must be setup as a counterpart of dbd_bind_ph.         */
             /* Look for '?' and replace it with 'value'.  Difficult      */
             /* task, note that you may have question marks inside        */
             /* quotes and comments the like ...  :-(                     */
             /* See DBD::mysql for an example. (Don't look too deep into  */
             /* the example, you will notice where I was lazy ...)        */
         }

       The next thing is to really execute the statement.

       Note that you must set the attributes  <u>NUM_OF_FIELDS</u>,  <u>NAME</u>,  etc  when  the  statement  is  successfully
       executed  if the driver has not already done so: they may be used even before a potential fetchrow().  In
       particular you have to tell <b>DBI</b> the number of fields that the statement has, because it will be  used  by
       <b>DBI</b> internally. Thus the function will typically ends with:

         if (isSelectStatement) {
             DBIc_NUM_FIELDS(imp_sth) = numFields;
             DBIc_ACTIVE_on(imp_sth);
         }

       It  is  important  that the <u>ACTIVE</u> flag only be set for "SELECT" statements (or any other statements that
       can return many values from the database using a cursor-like mechanism). See dbd_db_connect()  above  for
       more explanations.

       There  plans  for  a  preparse  function  to  be  provided by <b>DBI</b>, but this has not reached fruition yet.
       Meantime, if you want to know how ugly it can get, try looking at the dbd_ix_preparse() in  <b>DBD::Informix</b>
       <u>dbdimp.ec</u> and the related functions in <u>iustoken.c</u> and <u>sqltoken.c</u>.

       <u>The</u> <u>dbd_st_fetch</u> <u>method</u>

       This  function  fetches  a row of data. The row is stored in in an array, of "SV"'s that <b>DBI</b> prepares for
       you. This has two advantages: it is fast (you even reuse the "SV"'s, so they don't  have  to  be  created
       after the first fetchrow()), and it guarantees that <b>DBI</b> handles bind_cols() for you.

       What you do is the following:

         AV* av;
         int numFields = DBIc_NUM_FIELDS(imp_sth); /* Correct, if NUM_FIELDS
             is constant for this statement. There are drivers where this is
             not the case! */
         int chopBlanks = DBIc_is(imp_sth, DBIcf_ChopBlanks);
         int i;

         if (!fetch_new_row_of_data(...)) {
             ... /* check for error or end-of-data */
             DBIc_ACTIVE_off(imp_sth); /* turn off Active flag automatically */
             return Nullav;
         }
         /* get the fbav (field buffer array value) for this row       */
         /* it is very important to only call this after you know      */
         /* that you have a row of data to return.                     */
         av = DBIc_DBISTATE(imp_sth)-&gt;get_fbav(imp_sth);
         for (i = 0; i &lt; numFields; i++) {
             SV* sv = fetch_a_field(..., i);
             if (chopBlanks &amp;&amp; SvOK(sv) &amp;&amp; type_is_blank_padded(field_type[i])) {
                 /*  Remove white space from end (only) of sv  */
             }
             sv_setsv(AvARRAY(av)[i], sv); /* Note: (re)use! */
         }
         return av;

       There's  no  need  to  use  a  fetch_a_field() function returning an "SV*".  It's more common to use your
       database API functions to fetch the data as character strings and use code like this:

         sv_setpvn(AvARRAY(av)[i], char_ptr, char_count);

       "NULL" values must be returned as "undef". You can use code like this:

         SvOK_off(AvARRAY(av)[i]);

       The function returns the "AV" prepared by <b>DBI</b> for success or "Nullav" otherwise.

        *FIX ME* Discuss what happens when there's no more data to fetch.
        Are errors permitted if another fetch occurs after the first fetch
        that reports no more data. (Permitted, not required.)

       If an error occurs which leaves the <u>$sth</u> in a state where remaining rows can't  be  fetched  then  <u>Active</u>
       should be turned off before the method returns.

       <u>The</u> <u>dbd_st_finish3</u> <u>method</u>

       The  "$sth-&gt;finish()"  method  can  be  called  if  the user wishes to indicate that no more rows will be
       fetched even if the database has more rows to offer, and the <b>DBI</b> code can call the function when  handles
       are being destroyed. See the <b>DBI</b> specification for more background details.

       In both circumstances, the <b>DBI</b> code ends up calling the dbd_st_finish3() method (if you provide a mapping
       for dbd_st_finish3() in <u>dbdimp.h</u>), or dbd_st_finish() otherwise.  The difference is that dbd_st_finish3()
       takes  a  third argument which is an "int" with the value 1 if it is being called from a destroy() method
       and 0 otherwise.

       Note that <b>DBI</b> v1.32 and earlier test  on  dbd_db_finish3()  to  call  dbd_st_finish3();  if  you  provide
       dbd_st_finish3(), either define dbd_db_finish3() too, or insist on <b>DBI</b> v1.33 or later.

       All  it  <u>needs</u> to do is turn off the <u>Active</u> flag for the <u>sth</u>.  It will only be called by <u>Driver.xst</u> code,
       if the driver has set <u>ACTIVE</u> to on for the <u>sth</u>.

       Outline example:

         int dbd_st_finish3(SV* sth, imp_sth_t* imp_sth, int from_destroy) {
             if (DBIc_ACTIVE(imp_sth))
             {
                 /* close cursor or equivalent action */
                 DBIc_ACTIVE_off(imp_sth);
             }
             return 1;
         }

       The from_destroy parameter is true if dbd_st_finish3() is being  called  from  DESTROY()  -  and  so  the
       statement  is  about  to  be  destroyed.   For many drivers there is no point in doing anything more than
       turning off the <u>Active</u> flag in this case.

       The function returns <u>TRUE</u> for success, <u>FALSE</u> otherwise, but there isn't a lot anyone can do to recover if
       there is an error.

       <u>The</u> <u>dbd_st_destroy</u> <u>method</u>

       This function is the private part of the statement handle destructor.

         void dbd_st_destroy(SV* sth, imp_sth_t* imp_sth) {
             ... /* any clean-up that's needed */
             DBIc_IMPSET_off(imp_sth); /* let DBI know we've done it   */
         }

       The <b>DBI</b> <u>Driver.xst</u> code will call dbd_st_finish() for you, if the <u>sth</u> has the  <u>ACTIVE</u>  flag  set,  before
       calling dbd_st_destroy().

       <u>The</u> <u>dbd_st_STORE_attrib</u> <u>and</u> <u>dbd_st_FETCH_attrib</u> <u>methods</u>

       These  functions  correspond  to dbd_db_STORE() and dbd_db_FETCH() attrib above, except that they are for
       statement handles.  See above.

         int dbd_st_STORE_attrib(SV* sth, imp_sth_t* imp_sth, SV* keysv,
                                 SV* valuesv);
         SV* dbd_st_FETCH_attrib(SV* sth, imp_sth_t* imp_sth, SV* keysv);

       <u>The</u> <u>dbd_bind_ph</u> <u>method</u>

       This function is internally used by the bind_param() method, the bind_param_inout() method and by the <b>DBI</b>
       <u>Driver.xst</u> code if execute() is called with any bind parameters.

         int dbd_bind_ph (SV *sth, imp_sth_t *imp_sth, SV *param,
                          SV *value, IV sql_type, SV *attribs,
                          int is_inout, IV maxlen);

       The <u>param</u> argument holds an "IV" with the parameter number (1,  2,  ...).   The  <u>value</u>  argument  is  the
       parameter value and <u>sql_type</u> is its type.

       If your driver does not support bind_param_inout() then you should ignore <u>maxlen</u> and croak if <u>is_inout</u> is
       <u>TRUE</u>.

       If  your  driver  <u>does</u>  support  bind_param_inout()  then  you  should  note that <u>value</u> is the "SV" <u>after</u>
       dereferencing the reference passed to bind_param_inout().

       In drivers of simple databases the function will, for example, store the value in a parameter  array  and
       use it later in dbd_st_execute().  See the <b>DBD::mysql</b> driver for an example.

       <u>Implementing</u> <u>bind_param_inout</u> <u>support</u>

       To provide support for parameters bound by reference rather than by value, the driver must do a number of
       things.   First,  and  most  importantly,  it  must  note the references and stash them in its own driver
       structure.  Secondly, when a value is bound to a column, the driver must discard any  previous  reference
       bound  to  the  column.  On each execute, the driver must evaluate the references and internally bind the
       values resulting from the references.  This is only applicable if the user writes:

         $sth-&gt;execute;

       If the user writes:

         $sth-&gt;execute(@values);

       then  <b>DBI</b>  automatically  calls  the  binding  code  for  each  element  of  <u>@values</u>.   These  calls  are
       indistinguishable from explicit user calls to bind_param().

   <b>C/XS</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Makefile.PL</b>
       The  <u>Makefile.PL</u>  file  for a C/XS driver is similar to the code needed for a pure Perl driver, but there
       are a number of extra bits of information needed by the build system.

       For example, the attributes list passed to WriteMakefile() needs to specify the object files that need to
       be compiled and built into the shared object (DLL). This is often, but  not  necessarily,  just  <u>dbdimp.o</u>
       (unless that should be <u>dbdimp.obj</u> because you're building on MS Windows).

       Note  that you can reliably determine the extension of the object files from the <u>$Config{obj_ext}</u> values,
       and there are many other useful pieces of configuration information lurking in that hash.  You get access
       to it with:

           use Config;

   <b>Methods</b> <b>which</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b>
       The  <b>DBI</b>  code  implements  the  majority  of  the  methods  which  are  accessed  using   the   notation
       "DBI-&gt;function()",  the  only  exceptions  being "DBI-&gt;connect()" and "DBI-&gt;data_sources()" which require
       support from the driver.

       The <b>DBI</b> code implements the following documented driver, database and statement functions  which  do  not
       need to be written by the <b>DBD</b> driver writer.

       $dbh-&gt;<b>do()</b>
           The  default implementation of this function prepares, executes and destroys the statement.  This can
           be replaced if there is a better way to  implement  this,  such  as  "EXECUTE  IMMEDIATE"  which  can
           sometimes be used if there are no parameters.

       $h-&gt;<b>errstr()</b>
       $h-&gt;<b>err()</b>
       $h-&gt;<b>state()</b>
       $h-&gt;<b>trace()</b>
           The <b>DBD</b> driver does not need to worry about these routines at all.

       $h-&gt;{ChopBlanks}
           This  attribute needs to be honored during fetch() operations, but does not need to be handled by the
           attribute handling code.

       $h-&gt;{RaiseError}
           The <b>DBD</b> driver does not need to worry about this attribute at all.

       $h-&gt;{PrintError}
           The <b>DBD</b> driver does not need to worry about this attribute at all.

       $sth-&gt;<b>bind_col()</b>
           Assuming the driver uses the "DBIc_DBISTATE(imp_xxh)-&gt;get_fbav()" function (C drivers, see below), or
           the "$sth-&gt;_set_fbav($data)" method (Perl drivers) the driver does not need to do anything about this
           routine.

       $sth-&gt;<b>bind_columns()</b>
           Regardless of whether the driver uses "DBIc_DBISTATE(imp_xxh)-&gt;get_fbav()", the driver does not  need
           to do anything about this routine as it simply iteratively calls "$sth-&gt;bind_col()".

       The  <b>DBI</b>  code  implements  a  default  implementation of the following functions which do not need to be
       written by the <b>DBD</b> driver writer unless the default implementation is incorrect for the Driver.

       $dbh-&gt;<b>quote()</b>
           This should only be written if the database does  not  accept  the  ANSI  SQL  standard  for  quoting
           strings,  with  the  string  enclosed in single quotes and any embedded single quotes replaced by two
           consecutive single quotes.

           For the two argument form of quote, you need to implement  the  type_info()  method  to  provide  the
           information that quote needs.

       $dbh-&gt;<b>ping()</b>
           This  should  be  implemented  as  a  simple efficient way to determine whether the connection to the
           database is still alive. Typically code like this:

             sub ping {
                 my $dbh = shift;
                 $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare_cached(q{
                     select * from A_TABLE_NAME where 1=0
                 }) or return 0;
                 $sth-&gt;execute or return 0;
                 $sth-&gt;finish;
                 return 1;
             }

           where <u>A_TABLE_NAME</u> is the name of a table that always exists (such as a database system catalogue).

       $drh-&gt;default_user
           The default implementation of default_user will get the database username and  password  fields  from
           $ENV{DBI_USER} and $ENV{DBI_PASS}. You can override this method. It is called as follows:

             ($user, $pass) = $drh-&gt;default_user($user, $pass, $attr)

</pre><h4><b>METADATA</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The  exposition  above  ignores the <b>DBI</b> MetaData methods.  The metadata methods are all associated with a
       database handle.

   <b>Using</b> <b>DBI::DBD::Metadata</b>
       The <b>DBI::DBD::Metadata</b> module is a good semi-automatic way for the developer of a <b>DBD</b> module to write the
       get_info() and type_info() functions quickly and accurately.

       <u>Generating</u> <u>the</u> <u>get_info</u> <u>method</u>

       Prior to <b>DBI</b> v1.33, this existed as the method write_getinfo_pm() in the <b>DBI::DBD</b> module. From <b>DBI</b> v1.33,
       it exists as the method write_getinfo_pm() in the <b>DBI::DBD::Metadata</b> module. This discussion assumes  you
       have <b>DBI</b> v1.33 or later.

       You examine the documentation for write_getinfo_pm() using:

           perldoc DBI::DBD::Metadata

       To  use  it,  you  need  a  Perl  <b>DBI</b> driver for your database which implements the get_info() method. In
       practice, this means you need to install <b>DBD::ODBC</b>, an ODBC driver manager, and an ODBC driver  for  your
       database.

       With the pre-requisites in place, you might type:

           perl -MDBI::DBD::Metadata -we \
              "write_getinfo_pm (qw{ dbi:ODBC:foo_db username password Driver })"

       The procedure writes to standard output the code that should be added to your <u>Driver.pm</u> file and the code
       that should be written to <u>lib/DBD/Driver/GetInfo.pm</u>.

       You should review the output to ensure that it is sensible.

       <u>Generating</u> <u>the</u> <u>type_info</u> <u>method</u>

       Given  the  idea  of  the  write_getinfo_pm()  method,  it  was  not  hard  to  devise a parallel method,
       write_typeinfo_pm(), which does the analogous job  for  the  <b>DBI</b>  type_info_all()  metadata  method.  The
       write_typeinfo_pm() method was added to <b>DBI</b> v1.33.

       You examine the documentation for write_typeinfo_pm() using:

           perldoc DBI::DBD::Metadata

       The setup is exactly analogous to the mechanism described in "Generating the get_info method".

       With the pre-requisites in place, you might type:

           perl -MDBI::DBD::Metadata -we \
              "write_typeinfo_pm (qw{ dbi:ODBC:foo_db username password Driver })"

       The procedure writes to standard output the code that should be added to your <u>Driver.pm</u> file and the code
       that should be written to <u>lib/DBD/Driver/TypeInfo.pm</u>.

       You should review the output to ensure that it is sensible.

   <b>Writing</b> <b>DBD::Driver::db::get_info</b>
       If you use the <b>DBI::DBD::Metadata</b> module, then the code you need is generated for you.

       If you decide not to use the <b>DBI::DBD::Metadata</b> module, you should probably borrow the code from a driver
       that has done so (e.g.  <b>DBD::Informix</b> from version 1.05 onwards) and crib the code from there, or look at
       the  code  that  generates  that module and follow that. The method in <u>Driver.pm</u> will be very simple; the
       method in <u>lib/DBD/Driver/GetInfo.pm</u> is not very much more complex unless your DBMS itself  is  much  more
       complex.

       Note that some of the <b>DBI</b> utility methods rely on information from the get_info() method to perform their
       operations correctly. See, for example, the quote_identifier() and quote methods, discussed below.

   <b>Writing</b> <b>DBD::Driver::db::type_info_all</b>
       If you use the "DBI::DBD::Metadata" module, then the code you need is generated for you.

       If  you  decide  not  to  use the "DBI::DBD::Metadata" module, you should probably borrow the code from a
       driver that has done so (e.g.  "DBD::Informix" from version 1.05 onwards) and crib the code  from  there,
       or  look  at  the  code  that generates that module and follow that. The method in <u>Driver.pm</u> will be very
       simple; the method in <u>lib/DBD/Driver/TypeInfo.pm</u> is not very much more complex unless your DBMS itself is
       much more complex.

   <b>Writing</b> <b>DBD::Driver::db::type_info</b>
       The guidelines on writing this method are still not really clear.  No sample implementation is available.

   <b>Writing</b> <b>DBD::Driver::db::table_info</b>

   <b>Writing</b> <b>DBD::Driver::db::foreign_key_info</b>
        *FIX ME* The guidelines on writing this method have not been written yet.
        No sample implementation is available.

   <b>Writing</b> <b>DBD::Driver::db::tables</b>
       This method generates an array of names in a format suitable for being  embedded  in  SQL  statements  in
       places where a table name is expected.

       If  your  database  hews  close  enough  to  the  SQL  standard or if you have implemented an appropriate
       table_info() function and and the appropriate quote_identifier() function, then the <b>DBI</b>  default  version
       of this method will work for your driver too.

       Otherwise, you have to write a function yourself, such as:

           sub tables
           {
               my($dbh, $cat, $sch, $tab, $typ) = @_;
               my(@res);
               my($sth) = $dbh-&gt;table_info($cat, $sch, $tab, $typ);
               my(@arr);
               while (@arr = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_array)
               {
                   push @res, $dbh-&gt;quote_identifier($arr[0], $arr[1], $arr[2]);
               }
               return @res;
           }

       See also the default implementation in <u>DBI.pm</u>.

   <b>Writing</b> <b>DBD::Driver::db::quote</b>
       This  method  takes a value and converts it into a string suitable for embedding in an SQL statement as a
       string literal.

       If your DBMS accepts the SQL standard notation for strings (single quotes around the string  as  a  whole
       with  any embedded single quotes doubled up), then you do not need to write this method as <b>DBI</b> provides a
       default method that does it for you.

       If your DBMS uses an alternative notation or escape mechanism, then you need  to  provide  an  equivalent
       function.  For  example,  suppose  your  DBMS  used  C  notation with double quotes around the string and
       backslashes escaping both double quotes and backslashes themselves. Then you might write the function as:

           sub quote
           {
               my($dbh, $str) = @_;
               $str =~ s/["\\]/\\$&amp;/gmo;
               return qq{"$str"};
           }

       Handling newlines and other control characters is left as an exercise for the reader.

       This sample method ignores the <u>$data_type</u> indicator which is the optional second argument to the method.

   <b>Writing</b> <b>DBD::Driver::db::quote_identifier</b>
       This method is called to ensure that the name of the given  table  (or  other  database  object)  can  be
       embedded into an SQL statement without danger of misinterpretation. The result string should be usable in
       the text of an SQL statement as the identifier for a table.

       If  your  DBMS  accepts the SQL standard notation for quoted identifiers (which uses double quotes around
       the identifier as a whole, with any embedded double quotes doubled up) and accepts  <u>"schema"."identifier"</u>
       (and  <u>"catalog"."schema"."identifier"</u>  when  a  catalog is specified), then you do not need to write this
       method as <b>DBI</b> provides a default method that does it for you.

       In fact, even if your DBMS does not handle exactly that notation but you have implemented the  get_info()
       method  and  it gives the correct responses, then it will work for you. If your database is fussier, then
       you need to implement your own version of the function.

       For example, <b>DBD::Informix</b> has to deal with an environment variable <u>DELIMIDENT</u>. If it is  not  set,  then
       the  DBMS  treats names enclosed in double quotes as strings rather than names, which is usually a syntax
       error. Additionally, the catalog portion of the name  is  separated  from  the  schema  and  table  by  a
       different  delimiter  (colon  instead  of  dot),  and  the  catalog  portion is never enclosed in quotes.
       (Fortunately, valid strings for the catalog will never contain weird characters that  might  need  to  be
       escaped, unless you count dots, dashes, slashes and at-signs as weird.) Finally, an Informix database can
       contain  objects  that  cannot  be  accessed  because  they  were  created  by a user with the <u>DELIMIDENT</u>
       environment  variable  set,  but  the  current  user  does  not  have  it  set.  By  design  choice,  the
       quote_identifier()  method encloses those identifiers in double quotes anyway, which generally triggers a
       syntax error, and the metadata methods which generate lists of tables etc omit those identifiers from the
       result sets.

           sub quote_identifier
           {
               my($dbh, $cat, $sch, $obj) = @_;
               my($rv) = "";
               my($qq) = (defined $ENV{DELIMIDENT}) ? '"' : '';
               $rv .= qq{$cat:} if (defined $cat);
               if (defined $sch)
               {
                   if ($sch !~ m/^\w+$/o)
                   {
                       $qq = '"';
                       $sch =~ s/$qq/$qq$qq/gm;
                   }
                   $rv .= qq{$qq$sch$qq.};
               }
               if (defined $obj)
               {
                   if ($obj !~ m/^\w+$/o)
                   {
                       $qq = '"';
                       $obj =~ s/$qq/$qq$qq/gm;
                   }
                   $rv .= qq{$qq$obj$qq};
               }
               return $rv;
           }

       Handling newlines and other control characters is left as an exercise for the reader.

       Note that there is an optional fourth parameter to this function which  is  a  reference  to  a  hash  of
       attributes; this sample implementation ignores that.

       This sample implementation also ignores the single-argument variant of the method.

</pre><h4><b>TRACING</b></h4><pre>
       Tracing  in  DBI  is controlled with a combination of a trace level and a set of flags which together are
       known as the trace settings. The trace settings are stored in a single integer and  divided  into  levels
       and flags by a set of masks ("DBIc_TRACE_LEVEL_MASK" and "DBIc_TRACE_FLAGS_MASK").

       Each  handle  has  it's own trace settings and so does the DBI. When you call a method the DBI merges the
       handles settings into its own for the duration of the call: the trace flags of the handle are  OR'd  into
       the trace flags of the DBI, and if the handle has a higher trace level then the DBI trace level is raised
       to match it. The previous DBI trace settings are restored when the called method returns.

   <b>Trace</b> <b>Level</b>
       The  trace  level  is  the  first  4  bits  of the trace settings (masked by "DBIc_TRACE_FLAGS_MASK") and
       represents trace levels of 1 to 15. Do not output anything at trace  levels  less  than  3  as  they  are
       reserved for DBI.

       For advice on what to output at each level see "Trace Levels" in DBI.

       To test for a trace level you can use the "DBIc_TRACE_LEVEL" macro like this:

         if (DBIc_TRACE_LEVEL(imp_xxh) &gt;= 2) {
             PerlIO_printf(DBIc_LOGPIO(imp_xxh), "foobar");
         }

       Also  <b>note</b> the use of PerlIO_printf which you should always use for tracing and never the C "stdio.h" I/O
       functions.

   <b>Trace</b> <b>Flags</b>
       Trace flags are used to enable tracing of specific activities within the DBI and drivers. The DBI defines
       some trace flags and drivers can define others. DBI trace flag names begin  with  a  capital  letter  and
       driver  specific  names  begin  with a lowercase letter. For a list of DBI defined trace flags see "Trace
       Flags" in DBI.

       If you want to use private trace flags you'll probably want to be able to set them by name.  Drivers  are
       expected  to  override the parse_trace_flag (note the singular) and check if $trace_flag_name is a driver
       specific trace flags and, if not, then call the DBIs default <b>parse_trace_flag()</b>. To do that  you'll  need
       to define a <b>parse_trace_flag()</b> method like this:

         sub parse_trace_flag {
             my ($h, $name) = @_;
             return 0x01000000 if $name eq 'foo';
             return 0x02000000 if $name eq 'bar';
             return 0x04000000 if $name eq 'baz';
             return 0x08000000 if $name eq 'boo';
             return 0x10000000 if $name eq 'bop';
             return $h-&gt;SUPER::parse_trace_flag($name);
         }

       All  private  flag  names must be lowercase, and all private flags must be in the top 8 of the 32 bits of
       DBIc_TRACE_FLAGS(imp) i.e., 0xFF000000.

       If you've defined a <b>parse_trace_flag()</b> method in ::db you'll also want it in ::st, so just alias it in:

         *parse_trace_flag = \&amp;DBD::foo:db::parse_trace_flag;

       You may want to act on the current 'SQL' trace flag that DBI defines to output SQL  prepared/executed  as
       DBI currently does not do SQL tracing.

   <b>Trace</b> <b>Macros</b>
       Access to the trace level and trace flags is via a set of macros.

         DBIc_TRACE_SETTINGS(imp) returns the trace settings
         DBIc_TRACE_LEVEL(imp) returns the trace level
         DBIc_TRACE_FLAGS(imp) returns the trace flags
         DBIc_TRACE(imp, flags, flaglevel, level)

         e.g.,

         DBIc_TRACE(imp, 0, 0, 4)
           if level &gt;= 4

         DBIc_TRACE(imp, DBDtf_FOO, 2, 4)
           if tracing DBDtf_FOO &amp; level&gt;=2 or level&gt;=4

         DBIc_TRACE(imp, DBDtf_FOO, 2, 0)
           as above but never trace just due to level

</pre><h4><b>WRITING</b> <b>AN</b> <b>EMULATION</b> <b>LAYER</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>AN</b> <b>OLD</b> <b>PERL</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       Study  <u>Oraperl.pm</u>  (supplied  with  <b>DBD::Oracle</b>)  and  <u>Ingperl.pm</u>  (supplied  with  <b>DBD::Ingres</b>)  and the
       corresponding <u>dbdimp.c</u> files for ideas.

       Note that the emulation code sets "$dbh-&gt;{CompatMode} = 1;" for each connection so that the internals  of
       the driver can implement behaviour compatible with the old interface when dealing with those handles.

   <b>Setting</b> <b>emulation</b> <b>perl</b> <b>variables</b>
       For  example, ingperl has a <u>$sql_rowcount</u> variable. Rather than try to manually update this in <u>Ingperl.pm</u>
       it can be done faster in C code.  In dbd_init():

         sql_rowcount = perl_get_sv("Ingperl::sql_rowcount", GV_ADDMULTI);

       In the relevant places do:

         if (DBIc_COMPAT(imp_sth))     /* only do this for compatibility mode handles */
             sv_setiv(sql_rowcount, the_row_count);

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>MISCELLANEOUS</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>The</b> <b>imp_xyz_t</b> <b>types</b>
       Any handle has a corresponding C structure filled with private data.  Some of this data is  reserved  for
       use by <b>DBI</b> (except for using the DBIc macros below), some is for you. See the description of the <u>dbdimp.h</u>
       file  above  for  examples.  Most functions in <u>dbdimp.c</u> are passed both the handle "xyz" and a pointer to
       "imp_xyz". In rare cases, however, you may use the following macros:

       D_imp_dbh(dbh)
           Given a function argument <u>dbh</u>, declare a variable <u>imp_dbh</u> and initialize it with  a  pointer  to  the
           handles  private  data.  Note:  This  must  be  a  part of the function header, because it declares a
           variable.

       D_imp_sth(sth)
           Likewise for statement handles.

       D_imp_xxx(h)
           Given any handle, declare a variable <u>imp_xxx</u> and initialize it with a pointer to the handles  private
           data.  It  is safe, for example, to cast <u>imp_xxx</u> to "imp_dbh_t*", if "DBIc_TYPE(imp_xxx) == DBIt_DB".
           (You can also call "sv_derived_from(h, "DBI::db")", but that's much slower.)

       D_imp_dbh_from_sth
           Given a <u>imp_sth</u>, declare a variable <u>imp_dbh</u> and initialize it with a pointer to the  parent  database
           handle's implementors structure.

   <b>Using</b> <b>DBIc_IMPSET_on</b>
       The  driver code which initializes a handle should use DBIc_IMPSET_on() as soon as its state is such that
       the cleanup code must be called.  When this happens is determined by your driver code.

       <b>Failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>structures.</b>

       For example, <b>DBD::Informix</b> maintains a linked list of database handles in the  driver,  and  within  each
       handle,  a linked list of statements. Once a statement is added to the linked list, it is crucial that it
       is cleaned up (removed from the list). When <u><b>DBIc_IMPSET_on()</b></u> was being called too late, it  was  able  to
       cause all sorts of problems.

   <b>Using</b> <b>DBIc_is(),</b> <b>DBIc_has(),</b> <b>DBIc_on()</b> <b>and</b> <b>DBIc_off()</b>
       Once upon a long time ago, the only way of handling the internal <b>DBI</b> boolean flags/attributes was through
       macros such as:

         DBIc_WARN       DBIc_WARN_on        DBIc_WARN_off
         DBIc_COMPAT     DBIc_COMPAT_on      DBIc_COMPAT_off

       Each of these took an <u>imp_xxh</u> pointer as an argument.

       Since  then,  new  attributes have been added such as <u>ChopBlanks</u>, <u>RaiseError</u> and <u>PrintError</u>, and these do
       not have the full set of macros. The approved method for handling these is now the four macros:

         DBIc_is(imp, flag)
         DBIc_has(imp, flag)       an alias for DBIc_is
         DBIc_on(imp, flag)
         DBIc_off(imp, flag)
         DBIc_set(imp, flag, on)   set if on is true, else clear

       Consequently, the "DBIc_XXXXX" family of macros is now mostly deprecated and  new  drivers  should  avoid
       using  them,  even  though  the  older  drivers  will  probably  continue to do so for quite a while yet.
       However...

       There is  an  <u>important</u>  <u>exception</u>  to  that.  The  <u>ACTIVE</u>  and  <u>IMPSET</u>  flags  should  be  set  via  the
       DBIc_ACTIVE_on()  and  DBIc_IMPSET_on() macros, and unset via the DBIc_ACTIVE_off() and DBIc_IMPSET_off()
       macros.

   <b>Using</b> <b>the</b> <b>get_fbav()</b> <b>method</b>
       <b>THIS</b> <b>IS</b> <b>CRITICAL</b> <b>for</b> <b>C/XS</b> <b>drivers</b>.

       The "$sth-&gt;bind_col()" and "$sth-&gt;bind_columns()" documented in the <b>DBI</b> specification do not have  to  be
       implemented by the driver writer because <b>DBI</b> takes care of the details for you.

       However,    the    key    to   ensuring   that   bound   columns   work   is   to   call   the   function
       "DBIc_DBISTATE(imp_xxh)-&gt;get_fbav()" in the code which fetches a row of data.

       This returns an "AV", and each element of the "AV" contains the "SV" which should be set to  contain  the
       returned data.

       The  pure  Perl  equivalent is the "$sth-&gt;_set_fbav($data)" method, as described in the part on pure Perl
       drivers.

   <b>Casting</b> <b>strings</b> <b>to</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>types</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>SQL</b> <b>type</b>
       DBI from 1.611 (and DBIXS_REVISION 13606) defines the sql_type_cast_svpv method which may be used to cast
       a string representation of a value to a more specific Perl type based on a SQL type. You should  consider
       using  this  method  when  processing bound column data as it provides some support for the TYPE bind_col
       attribute which is rarely used in drivers.

         int sql_type_cast_svpv(pTHX_ SV *sv, int sql_type, U32 flags, void *v)

       "sv" is what you would like cast, "sql_type" is one of the DBI defined SQL  types  (e.g.,  "SQL_INTEGER")
       and "flags" is a bitmask as follows:

       DBIstcf_STRICT
           If set this indicates you want an error state returned if the cast cannot be performed.

       DBIstcf_DISCARD_STRING
           If set and the pv portion of the "sv" is cast then this will cause sv's pv to be freed up.

       sql_type_cast_svpv returns the following states:

        -2 sql_type is not handled - sv not changed
        -1 sv is undef, sv not changed
         0 sv could not be cast cleanly and DBIstcf_STRICT was specified
         1 sv could not be case cleanly and DBIstcf_STRICT was not specified
         2 sv was cast ok

       The  current implementation of sql_type_cast_svpv supports "SQL_INTEGER", "SQL_DOUBLE" and "SQL_NUMERIC".
       "SQL_INTEGER" uses sv_2iv and hence may set IV, UV or NV  depending  on  the  number.  "SQL_DOUBLE"  uses
       sv_2nv so may set NV and "SQL_NUMERIC" will set IV or UV or NV.

       DBIstcf_STRICT   should   be  implemented  as  the  StrictlyTyped  attribute  and  DBIstcf_DISCARD_STRING
       implemented as the DiscardString attribute to the bind_col method and both default to off.

       See DBD::Oracle for an example of how this is used.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCLASSING</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>DRIVERS</b></h4><pre>
       This is definitely an open subject. It can be done, as demonstrated by the <b>DBD::File</b> driver,  but  it  is
       not as simple as one might think.

       (Note that this topic is different from subclassing the <b>DBI</b>. For an example of that, see the <u>t/subclass.t</u>
       file supplied with the <b>DBI</b>.)

       The  main  problem  is  that the <u>dbh</u>'s and <u>sth</u>'s that your connect() and prepare() methods return are not
       instances of your <b>DBD::Driver::db</b> or <b>DBD::Driver::st</b>  packages,  they  are  not  even  derived  from  it.
       Instead  they are instances of the <b>DBI::db</b> or <b>DBI::st</b> classes or a derived subclass. Thus, if you write a
       method mymethod() and do a

         $dbh-&gt;mymethod()

       then the autoloader will search for that method in the package <b>DBI::db</b>.  Of course you can instead to a

         $dbh-&gt;func('mymethod')

       and that will indeed work, even if mymethod() is inherited, but not without additional work. Setting <u>@ISA</u>
       is not sufficient.

   <b>Overwriting</b> <b>methods</b>
       The first problem is, that the connect() method has no  idea  of  subclasses.  For  example,  you  cannot
       implement base class and subclass in the same file: The install_driver() method wants to do a

         require DBD::Driver;

       In  particular,  your  subclass  <b>has</b>  to be a separate driver, from the view of <b>DBI</b>, and you cannot share
       driver handles.

       Of course that's not much of a problem. You should even be able to inherit  the  base  classes  connect()
       method.  But  you  cannot  simply  overwrite  the  method, unless you do something like this, quoted from
       <b>DBD::CSV</b>:

         sub connect ($$;$$$) {
             my ($drh, $dbname, $user, $auth, $attr) = @_;

             my $this = $drh-&gt;DBD::File::dr::connect($dbname, $user, $auth, $attr);
             if (!exists($this-&gt;{csv_tables})) {
                 $this-&gt;{csv_tables} = {};
             }

             $this;
         }

       Note that we cannot do a

         $drh-&gt;SUPER::connect($dbname, $user, $auth, $attr);

       as we would usually do in a an OO environment, because <u>$drh</u> is an instance of <b>DBI::dr</b>. And note, that the
       connect() method of <b>DBD::File</b> is able to handle subclass attributes. See the  description  of  Pure  Perl
       drivers above.

       It is essential that you always call superclass method in the above manner. However, that should do.

   <b>Attribute</b> <b>handling</b>
       Fortunately  the  <b>DBI</b> specifications allow a simple, but still performant way of handling attributes. The
       idea is based on the convention that any driver uses a prefix <u>driver</u><b>_</b> for its private methods. Thus  it's
       always  clear  whether  to  pass attributes to the super class or not. For example, consider this STORE()
       method from the <b>DBD::CSV</b> class:

         sub STORE {
             my ($dbh, $attr, $val) = @_;
             if ($attr !~ /^driver_/) {
                 return $dbh-&gt;DBD::File::db::STORE($attr, $val);
             }
             if ($attr eq 'driver_foo') {
             ...
         }
