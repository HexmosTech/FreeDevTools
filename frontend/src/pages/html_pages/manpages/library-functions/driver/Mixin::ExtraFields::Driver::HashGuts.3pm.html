</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Mixin::ExtraFields::Driver::HashGuts - store extras in a hashy object's guts

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.140003

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package Your::HashBased::Class;

         use Mixin::ExtraFields -fields =&gt; { driver =&gt; 'HashGuts' };

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This driver class implements an extremely simple storage mechanism: extras are stored on the object on
       which the mixed-in methods are called.  By default, they are stored under the key returned by the
       "default_has_key" method, but this can be changed by providing a "hash_key" argument to the driver
       configuration, like so:

         use Mixin::ExtraFields -fields =&gt; {
           driver =&gt; { class =&gt; 'HashGuts', hash_key =&gt; "\0Something\0Wicked\0" }
         };

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the methods required by Mixin::ExtraFields::Driver, the following methods are provided:

   <b>hash_key</b>
         my $key = $driver-&gt;hash_key;

       This method returns the key where the driver will store its extras.

   <b>default_hash_key</b>
       If no "hash_key" argument is given for the driver, this method is called during driver initialization.
       It will return a unique string to be used as the hash key.

   <b>storage</b>
       This method returns the hashref of storage used for extras.  Individual objects get weak references to
       their id within this hashref.

   <b>storage_for</b>
         my $stash = $driver-&gt;storage_for($object, $id);

       This method returns the hashref to use to store extras for the given object and id.  This hashref is
       stored on both the hash-based object (in its "hash_key" entry) and on the driver (in the entry for $id in
       its "storage" hash).

       All objects with the same id should end up with the same hash in their "hash_key" field.  <b>None</b> of these
       references are weakened, which means two things:  first, even if all objects with a given id go out of
       scope, future objects with that id will retain the original extras; secondly, memory used to store extras
       is never reclaimed.  If this is a problem, use a more sophisticated driver.
