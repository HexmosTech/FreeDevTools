</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Data::ObjectDriver::Driver::BaseCache - parent class for caching object drivers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Data::ObjectDriver::Driver::BaseCache provides behavior utilized for all caching object drivers for use
       with Data::ObjectDriver. That behavior is looking up requested objects in a cache, and falling back to
       another Data::ObjectDriver for a cache miss.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Drivers based on Data::ObjectDriver::Driver::BaseCache support all standard operations for
       Data::ObjectDriver object drivers (lookup, search, update, insert, replace, remove, and fetch_data).
       BaseCache-derived drivers also support:

   <b>"Data::ObjectDriver::Driver::BaseCache-&gt;new(</b> <b>%params</b> <b>)"</b>
       Creates a new instance of a BaseCache driver. Required members of %params are:

       •   "cache"

           The  object with which to interface with the external cache. For example, for the "Memcached" caching
           object driver, the value of the "cache" member should be a "Cache::Memcached" object.

       •   "fallback"

           The "Data::ObjectDriver" object driver to which to fall back when the cache does not  yet  contain  a
           requested  object.  The  "fallback" member is also the object driver to which updates and inserts are
           passed.

   <b>"$driver-&gt;cache_key($class,</b> <b>$primary_key)"</b>
       Returns the cache key for an object of the given class with the given primary key. The cache key is  used
       with the external cache to identify an object.

       In  BaseCache's  implementation,  the  key  is the class name and all the column names of the primary key
       concatenated, separated by single colons.

   <b>"$driver-&gt;get_multi_from_cache(@cache_keys)"</b>
       Returns the objects corresponding to the given cache keys, as represented in the external cache.

   <b>"Data::ObjectDriver::Driver::BaseClass-&gt;Disabled([</b> <b>$value</b> <b>])"</b>
       Returns whether caches of the given class are disabled, first updating the disabled state of  drivers  of
       the  given class to $value, if given. When a caching driver is disabled, all operations are automatically
       passed through to the fallback object driver.

       Note that, if you disable and re-enable a caching driver, some of the cached data may be invalid  due  to
       updates that were performed while the driver was disabled not being reflected in the external cache.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCLASSING</b></h4><pre>
       When  creating  a  caching  driver from "BaseCache", the behavior for interaction with the external cache
       (through the "cache" member of the constructor) must be defined by implementing these methods:

   <b>"$driver-&gt;add_to_cache($cache_key,</b> <b>$obj_repr)"</b>
       Sets the cache entry for $cache_key to the given object representation. This  method  is  used  when  the
       corresponding object is being saved to the database for the first time.

   <b>"$driver-&gt;update_cache($cache_key,</b> <b>$obj_repr)"</b>
       Sets  the  cache  entry  for  $cache_key to the given object representation. This method is used when the
       corresponding object already exists in the database and is being saved.

   <b>"$driver-&gt;remove_from_cache($cache_key)"</b>
       Clears the given cache entry. This method is used when the corresponding object is being deleted from the
       database.

   <b>"$driver-&gt;get_from_cache($cache_key)"</b>
       Returns the object corresponding to the given cache key, as it exists in the external cache.

   <b>"$driver-&gt;inflate($class,</b> <b>$obj_repr)"</b>
       Returns an instance of $class containing the data in the representation $obj_repr, as returned  from  the
       "get_from_cache" method.

       In  BaseCache's  implementation,  no  operation  is  performed. "get_from_cache" should itself return the
       appropriate instances of "Data::ObjectDriver::BaseObject".

   <b>"$driver-&gt;deflate($obj)"</b>
       Returns a representation of the given "Data::ObjectDriver::BaseObject" instance, suitable for passing  to
       the "add_to_cache" and "update_cache" methods.

       In  BaseCache's  implementation,  no  operation  is  performed.  "add_to_cache" and "update_cache" should
       themselves accept "Data::ObjectDriver::BaseObject" instances.
