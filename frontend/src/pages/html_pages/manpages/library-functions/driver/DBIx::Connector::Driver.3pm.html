</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DBIx::Connector::Driver - Database-specific connection interface

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Some of the things that DBIx::Connector does are implemented differently by different drivers, or the
       official interface provided by the DBI may not be implemented for a particular driver. The driver-
       specific code therefore is encapsulated in this separate driver class.

       Most of the DBI drivers work uniformly, so in most cases the implementation provided here in
       DBIx::Connector::Driver will work just fine. It's only when something is different that a driver subclass
       needs to be added. In such a case, the subclass's name is the same as the DBI driver. For example the
       driver for DBD::Pg is DBIx::Connector::Driver::Pg and the driver for DBD::mysql is
       DBIx::Connector::Driver::mysql.

       If you're just a user of DBIx::Connector, you can ignore the driver classes.  DBIx::Connector uses them
       internally to do its magic, so you needn't worry about them.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       In case you need to implement a driver, here's the interface you can modify.

   <b>Constructor</b>
       <u>"new"</u>

         my $driver = DBIx::Connector::Driver-&gt;new( $driver );

       Constructs and returns a driver object. Each driver class is implemented as a singleton, so the same
       driver object is always returned for the same driver.  The "driver" parameter should be a Perl DBI driver
       name, such as "Pg" for DBD::Pg or "SQLite" for DBD::SQLite. If a subclass has been defined for $driver,
       then the object will be of that class.  Otherwise it will be an instance of the driver base class.

   <b>Instance</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <u>"ping"</u>

         $driver-&gt;ping($dbh);

       Calls "$dbh-&gt;ping". Override if for some reason the DBI driver doesn't do it right.

       <u>"begin_work"</u>

         $driver-&gt;begin_work($dbh);

       Calls "$dbh-&gt;begin_work". Override if for some reason the DBI driver doesn't do it right.

       <u>"commit"</u>

         $driver-&gt;commit($dbh);

       Calls "$dbh-&gt;commit". Override if for some reason the DBI driver doesn't do it right.

       <u>"rollback"</u>

         $driver-&gt;rollback($dbh);

       Calls "$dbh-&gt;rollback". Override if for some reason the DBI driver doesn't do it right.

       <u>"savepoint"</u>

         $driver-&gt;savepoint($dbh, $name);

       A no-op. Override if your database does in fact support savepoints. The driver subclass should create a
       savepoint with the given $name. See the implementations in DBIx::Connector::Driver::Pg and
       DBIx::Connector::Driver::Oracle for examples.

       <u>"release"</u>

         $driver-&gt;release($dbh, $name);

       A no-op. Override if your database does in fact support savepoints. The driver subclass should release
       the savepoint with the given $name. See the implementations in DBIx::Connector::Driver::Pg and
       DBIx::Connector::Driver::Oracle for examples.

       <u>"rollback_to"</u>

         $driver-&gt;rollback_to($dbh, $name);

       A no-op. Override if your database does in fact support savepoints. The driver subclass should rollback
       to the savepoint with the given $name. See the implementations in DBIx::Connector::Driver::Pg and
       DBIx::Connector::Driver::Oracle for examples.
