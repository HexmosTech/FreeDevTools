</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Authorization::Driver - Base module for building driver classes for
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Authorization

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        package CGI::Application::Plugin::Authorization::Driver::MyDriver;
        use base qw(CGI::Application::Plugin::Authorization::Driver);

         sub authorize_user {
             my $self = shift;
             my @params = @_;

             if ( &gt;&gt;&gt; Valid Access Permissions &lt;&lt;&lt; ) {
                 return 1;
             }
             return;
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is a base class for all driver classes for the CGI::Application::Plugin::Authorization
       plugin.  Each driver class is required to provide only one method to authorize the given parameters.
       Often this will be a list of groups that the user needs to be a part of, although it could be anything.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       This is a constructor that can create a new Driver object.  It requires an Authorization object as its
       first parameter, and any number of other parameters that will be used as options depending on which
       Driver object is being created.  You shouldn't need to call this as the Authorization plugin takes care
       of creating Driver objects.

   <b>initialize</b>
       This method will be called right after a new Driver object is created.  So any startup customizations can
       be dealt with here.

   <b>options</b>
       This will return a list of options that were provided when this driver was configured by the user.

   <b>find_option</b>
       This method will search the Driver options for a specific key and return the value it finds.  This method
       assumes that the Driver configuration contains a hash of information.  If it does not, then you will have
       to parse the option manually in the subclass.

   <b>authz</b>
       This will return the underlying CGI::Application::Plugin::Authorization object.  In most cases it will
       not be necessary to access this.

   <b>username</b>
       This will return the name of the current logged in user by calling the "username" method documented in
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Authorization.

   <b>authorize</b>
        # User must be in the admin group to have access to this runmode
        return $self-&gt;authz-&gt;forbidden unless $self-&gt;authz-&gt;authorize('admin');

       This method will verify that the currently logged in user (as found through username) passes the
       authorization checks based on the given parameters, usually a list of groups.

   <b>authorize_user</b>
       This method needs to be provided by the driver class.  It needs to be an object method that accepts a
       username, followed by a list of parameters, and will verify that the user passes the authorization checks
       based on the given parameters.  It should return a true value if the checks succeed.
