</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CHI::Driver::File - File-based cache using one file per entry in a multi-level directory structure

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.61

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use CHI;

           my $cache = CHI-&gt;new(
               driver         =&gt; 'File',
               root_dir       =&gt; '/path/to/cache/root',
               depth          =&gt; 3,
               max_key_length =&gt; 64
           );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This cache driver stores data on the filesystem, so that it can be shared between processes on a single
       machine, or even on multiple machines if using NFS.

       Each item is stored in its own file. By default, during a set, a temporary file is created and then
       atomically renamed to the proper file. While not the most efficient, it eliminates the need for locking
       (with multiple overlapping sets, the last one "wins") and makes this cache usable in environments like
       NFS where locking might normally be undesirable.

       By default, the base filename is the key itself, with unsafe characters escaped similar to URL escaping.
       If the escaped key is larger than "max_key_length" (default 248 characters), it will be digested. You may
       want to lower "max_key_length" if you are storing a lot of items as long filenames can be more expensive
       to work with.

       The files are evenly distributed within a multi-level directory structure with a customizable "depth", to
       minimize the time needed to search for a given entry.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       When using this driver, the following options can be passed to CHI-&gt;<b>new()</b> in addition to the CHI.

       root_dir
           The  location in the filesystem that will hold the root of the cache.  Defaults to a directory called
           'chi-driver-file' under the OS default temp directory (e.g. '<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>' on UNIX). This directory  will  be
           created as needed on the first cache set.

       depth
           The  number  of  subdirectories deep to place cache files. Defaults to 2. This should be large enough
           that no leaf directory has more than a few hundred files. Each non-leaf directory contains up  to  16
           subdirectories (0-9, A-F).

       dir_create_mode
           Permissions mode to use when creating directories. Defaults to 0775.

       file_create_mode
           Permissions mode to use when creating files, modified by the current umask.  Defaults to 0666.

       file_extension
           Extension to append to filename. Default is ".dat".

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       path_to_key ( $key )
           Returns  the full path to the cache file representing $key, whether or not that entry exists. Returns
           the empty list if a valid path cannot be computed, for example if the key is too long.

       path_to_namespace
           Returns the full path to the directory representing this cache's namespace, whether or not it has any
           entries.

</pre><h4><b>TEMPORARY</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>RENAME</b></h4><pre>
       By default, during a set, a temporary file is created and then atomically renamed  to  the  proper  file.
       This eliminates the need for locking. You can subclass and override method <u>generate_temporary_filename</u> to
       either  change  the  path  of the temporary filename, or skip the temporary file and rename altogether by
       having it return undef.
