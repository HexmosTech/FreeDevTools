</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       If the application wants to directly talk to the braille terminal, it should use Raw Mode. In this
       special mode, the driver gives the whole control of the terminal to it: <u>brltty</u> doesn't work any more.

       For this, it simply has to call <b>brlapi_enterRawMode()</b>, then <b>brlapi_sendRaw()</b> and <b>brlapi_recvRaw()</b>, and
       finally give control back thanks to <b>brlapi_leaveRawMode()</b>.

       Special care of the terminal should be taken, since one might completely trash the terminal's data, or
       even lock it! The application should always check for terminal's type thanks to <b>brlapi_getDriverName()</b>.

       The client can also make brltty close the driver by using <b>brlapi_suspendDriver()</b>, and resume it again
       with <b>brlapi_resumeDriver()</b>. This should not be used if possible: raw mode should be sufficient for any
       use. If not, please ask for features :)

   <b>int</b> <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi_enterRawMode</b> <b>(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b> <b>driver)</b>
       Switch to Raw mode

       TODO: document which functions work in raw mode.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>driver</u> Specifies the name of the driver for which the raw communication will be established.

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 on success, -1 on error

   <b>int</b> <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi_leaveRawMode</b> <b>(void)</b>
       Leave Raw mode

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 on success, -1 on error

   <b>ssize_t</b> <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi_recvRaw</b> <b>(void</b> <b>*</b> <b>buffer,</b> <b>size_t</b> <b>size)</b>
       Get Raw data

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>buffer</u> points on a buffer where the function will store the received data;
           <u>size</u> holds the buffer size.

       <b>Returns</b>
           its size, -1 on error, or on interruption by a signal or a parameter change notification, in which
           case brlapi_errno will be BRLAPI_ERROR_LIBCERR and errno will be EINTR.

   <b>int</b> <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi_resumeDriver</b> <b>(void)</b>
       Resume braille driver

       <b>Returns</b>
           -1 on error

   <b>ssize_t</b> <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi_sendRaw</b> <b>(const</b> <b>void</b> <b>*</b> <b>buffer,</b> <b>size_t</b> <b>size)</b>
       Send Raw data

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>buffer</u> points on the data;
           <u>size</u> holds the packet size.

       <b>Returns</b>
           size on success, -1 on error

   <b>int</b> <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi_suspendDriver</b> <b>(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b> <b>driver)</b>
       Suspend braille driver

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>driver</u> Specifies the name of the driver which will be suspended.

       <b>Returns</b>
           -1 on error
