</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Component::Client::Ident - A component that provides non-blocking ident lookups to your sessions.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use POE::Component::Client::Ident;

          my $poco_obj = POE::Component::Client::Ident-&gt;spawn ( 'Ident-Client' );

          $kernel-&gt;post ( 'Ident-Client' =&gt; query =&gt; Socket =&gt; $socket );

          $kernel-&gt;post ( 'Ident-Client' =&gt; query =&gt; PeerAddr =&gt; '10.0.0.1',
                                                     PeerPort =&gt; 2345,
                                                     SockAddr =&gt; '192.168.1.254',
                                                     SockPort =&gt; 6669,
                                                     BuggyIdentd =&gt; 1,
                                                     TimeOut =&gt; 30 );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Component::Client::Ident is a POE component that provides non-blocking Ident lookup services to
       other components and sessions. The Ident protocol is described in RFC 1413
       &lt;<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1413.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1413.html</a>&gt;.

       The component takes requests in the form of events, spawns POE::Component::Client::Ident::Agent sessions
       to perform the Ident queries and returns the appropriate responses to the requesting session.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       "spawn"
           Takes one argument, a kernel alias to christen the new component with.

           Returns an object.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       These methods are available on the poco object returned by <b>spawn()</b>.

       "session_id"
           Returns the component's session ID.

       "shutdown"
           Takes no arguments. Causes the component to terminate gracefully. Any pending Ident::Agent components
           that are running will be closed without returning events.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The component accepts the following events:

       "query"
           Takes either the arguments:

             "PeerAddr", the remote IP address where a TCP connection has originated;
             "PeerPort", the port where the TCP has originated from;
             "SockAddr", the address of our end of the connection;
             "SockPort", the port of our end of the connection;

           OR:

             "Socket", the socket handle of the connection, the component will work out all
             the details for you. If Socket is defined, it will override the settings of the
             other arguments.

           See the documentation for Ident-Agent for extra parameters you may pass.

       "shutdown"
           Takes no arguments. Causes the component to terminate gracefully. Any pending Ident::Agent components
           that are running will be closed without returning events.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The events you can expect to receive having submitted a 'query'.

       All the events returned by the component have a hashref as ARG0. This hashref contains the arguments that
       were  passed  to  the  component. If a socket handle was passed, the hashref will contain the appropriate
       PeerAddr, PeerPort, SockAddr and Sock Port.

       "ident_client_reply"
           Returned when the component receives a USERID response from the identd. ARG0 is hashref, ARG1 is  the
           opsys  field  and ARG2 is the userid or something else depending on whether the opsys field is set to
           'OTHER' ( Don't blame me, read the RFC ).

       "ident_client_error"
           Returned when the component receives an ERROR response from  the  identd,  there  was  some  sort  of
           communication  error with the remote host ( ie. no identd running ) or it had some other problem with
           making the connection to the other host. No matter.  ARG0 is hashref, ARG1 is the type of error.
