</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Color::Palette - a set of named colors

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.100004

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The libraries in the Color-Palette distribution are meant to make it easy to build sets of named colors,
       and to write applications that can define and validate the color names they required.

       For example, a color palette might contain the following data:

         highlights =&gt; #f0f000
         background =&gt; #333
         sidebarBackground =&gt; #88d
         sidebarText       =&gt; 'highlights'
         sidebarBoder      =&gt; 'sidebarText'

       Colors can be defined by a color specifier (a Graphics::Color object, a CSS-style hex triple, or an
       arrayref of RGB values) or by a name of another color that appears in the palette.  If colors are defined
       in terms of another color that doesn't exist, an exception will be raised.

       Applications that wish to use color palettes can provide schemas that define the names they expect to be
       present in a palette.  These schemas are Color::Palette::Schema objects.

       A palette can be checked against a schema with the schema's "check" method, or may be reduced to the
       minimal set of colors needed to satisfy the schema with the palette's "optimized_for" method.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>colors</b>
       This attribute is a hashref.  Keys are color names and values are either Color objects or names of other
       colors.  To get at the color object for a name consult the "color" method.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>color</b>
         my $color_obj = $palette-&gt;color('extremeHighlight');

       This method will return the Color object to be used for the given name.

   <b>color_names</b>
         my @names = $palette-&gt;color_names;

       This method returns a list of all color names the object knows about.

   <b>as_css_hash</b>
         my $triple_for = $palette-&gt;as_css_hash

       This method returns a hashref.  Every color name known to the palette has an entry, and the value is the
       CSS-safe hex string for the resolved color.  For example, the output for the color scheme in the
       "DESCRIPTION" section would be:

         {
           highlights =&gt; '#f0f000',
           background =&gt; '#333333',
           sidebarBackground =&gt; #8888dd',
           sidebarText       =&gt; #f0f000',
           sidebarBoder      =&gt; #f0f000',
         }

   <b>as_strict_css_hash</b>
         my $hashref = $palette-&gt;as_strict_css_hash;

       This method behaves just like "as_css_hash", but the returned hashref is tied so that trying to read
       values for keys that do not exist is fatal.  The hash may also become read-only in the future.

   <b>optimized_for</b>
         my $optimized_palette = $palette-&gt;optimized_for($schema);

       This method returns a new palette containing only the colors needed to fulfill the requirements of the
       given schema.  This is useful for reducing a large palette to the small set that must be embedded in a
       document.

       "optimize_for" redispatches to this method for historical reasons.
