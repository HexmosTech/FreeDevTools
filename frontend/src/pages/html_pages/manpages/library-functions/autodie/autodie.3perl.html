       autodie - Replace functions with ones that succeed or die with lexical scope

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use autodie;            # Recommended: implies 'use autodie qw(:default)'

           use autodie qw(:all);   # Recommended more: defaults and system/exec.

           use autodie qw(open close);   # open/close succeed or die

           open(my $fh, "&lt;", $filename); # No need to check!

           {
               no autodie qw(open);          # open failures won't die
               open(my $fh, "&lt;", $filename); # Could fail silently!
               no autodie;                   # disable all autodies
           }

           print "Hello World" or die $!;    # autodie DOESN'T check print!

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
               bIlujDI' yIchegh()Qo'; yIHegh()!

               It is better to die() than to return() in failure.

                       -- Klingon programming proverb.

       The "autodie" pragma provides a convenient way to replace functions that normally return false on failure
       with equivalents that throw an exception on failure.

       The "autodie" pragma has <u>lexical</u> <u>scope</u>, meaning that functions and subroutines altered with "autodie"
       will only change their behaviour until the end of the enclosing block, file, or "eval".

       If "system" is specified as an argument to "autodie", then it uses IPC::System::Simple to do the heavy
       lifting.  See the description of that module for more information.

</pre><h4><b>EXCEPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Exceptions produced by the "autodie" pragma are members of the autodie::exception class.  The preferred
       way to work with these exceptions under Perl 5.10 is as follows:

           eval {
               use autodie;

               open(my $fh, '&lt;', $some_file);

               my @records = &lt;$fh&gt;;

               # Do things with @records...

               close($fh);
           };

           if ($@ and $@-&gt;isa('autodie::exception')) {
               if ($@-&gt;matches('open')) { print "Error from open\n";   }
               if ($@-&gt;matches(':io' )) { print "Non-open, IO error."; }
           } elsif ($@) {
               # A non-autodie exception.
           }

       See autodie::exception for further information on interrogating exceptions.

</pre><h4><b>CATEGORIES</b></h4><pre>
       Autodie uses a simple set of categories to group together similar built-ins.  Requesting a category type
       (starting with a colon) will enable autodie for all built-ins beneath that category.  For example,
       requesting ":file" will enable autodie for "close", "fcntl", "open" and "sysopen".

       The categories are currently:

           :all
               :default
                   :io
                       read
                       seek
                       sysread
                       sysseek
                       syswrite
                       :dbm
                           dbmclose
                           dbmopen
                       :file
                           binmode
                           close
                           chmod
                           chown
                           fcntl
                           flock
                           ioctl
                           open
                           sysopen
                           truncate
                       :filesys
                           chdir
                           closedir
                           opendir
                           link
                           mkdir
                           readlink
                           rename
                           rmdir
                           symlink
                           unlink
                       :ipc
                           kill
                           pipe
                           :msg
                               msgctl
                               msgget
                               msgrcv
                               msgsnd
                           :semaphore
                               semctl
                               semget
                               semop
                           :shm
                               shmctl
                               shmget
                               shmread
                       :socket
                           accept
                           bind
                           connect
                           getsockopt
                           listen
                           recv
                           send
                           setsockopt
                           shutdown
                           socketpair
                   :threads
                       fork
               :system
                   system
                   exec

       Note that while the above category system is presently a strict hierarchy, this should not be assumed.

       A plain "use autodie" implies "use autodie qw(:default)".  Note that "system" and "exec" are not enabled
       by default.  "system" requires the optional IPC::System::Simple module to be installed, and enabling
       "system" or "exec" will invalidate their exotic forms.  See "BUGS" below for more details.

       The syntax:

           use autodie qw(:1.994);

       allows the ":default" list from a particular version to be used.  This provides the convenience of using
       the default methods, but the surety that no behavioral changes will occur if the "autodie" module is
       upgraded.

       "autodie" can be enabled for all of Perl's built-ins, including "system" and "exec" with:

           use autodie qw(:all);

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTION</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>print</b>
       The autodie pragma <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>check</b> <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>"print"</b>.

   <b>flock</b>
       It is not considered an error for "flock" to return false if it fails due to an "EWOULDBLOCK" (or
       equivalent) condition.  This means one can still use the common convention of testing the return value of
       "flock" when called with the "LOCK_NB" option:

           use autodie;

           if ( flock($fh, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB) ) {
               # We have a lock
           }

       Autodying "flock" will generate an exception if "flock" returns false with any other error.

   <b>system/exec</b>
       The "system" built-in is considered to have failed in the following circumstances:

       •   The command does not start.

       •   The command is killed by a signal.

       •   The command returns a non-zero exit value (but see below).

       On success, the autodying form of "system" returns the <u>exit</u> <u>value</u> rather than the contents of $?.

       Additional allowable exit values can be supplied as an optional first argument to autodying "system":

           system( [ 0, 1, 2 ], $cmd, @args);  # 0,1,2 are good exit values

       "autodie"  uses  the  IPC::System::Simple  module  to change "system".  See its documentation for further
       information.

       Applying "autodie" to "system" or "exec" causes the exotic forms "system { $cmd } @args " or "exec { $cmd
       } @args" to be considered a syntax error until the end of the lexical scope.  If you really need  to  use
       the exotic form, you can call "CORE::system" or "CORE::exec" instead, or use "no autodie qw(system exec)"
       before calling the exotic form.

</pre><h4><b>GOTCHAS</b></h4><pre>
       Functions  called  in  list  context  are  assumed to have failed if they return an empty list, or a list
       consisting only of a single undef element.

       Some builtins (e.g. "chdir" or "truncate") has a call signature that  cannot  completely  be  represented
       with  a  Perl  prototype.   This  means  that  some valid Perl code will be invalid under autodie.  As an
       example:

         chdir(BAREWORD);

       Without autodie (and assuming BAREWORD is an open filehandle/dirhandle) this is a valid  call  to  chdir.
       But  under autodie, "chdir" will behave like it had the prototype ";$" and thus BAREWORD will be a syntax
       error (under "use strict".  Without strict, it will interpreted as a filename).

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       :void cannot be used with lexical scope
           The ":void" option is supported in Fatal, but not "autodie".  To workaround this,  "autodie"  may  be
           explicitly  disabled  until  the  end of the current block with "no autodie".  To disable autodie for
           only a single function (eg, open) use "no autodie qw(open)".

           "autodie" performs no checking of called context to determine whether  to  throw  an  exception;  the
           explicitness of error handling with "autodie" is a deliberate feature.

       No user hints defined for %s
           You've  insisted  on  hints  for user-subroutines, either by pre-pending a "!" to the subroutine name
           itself, or earlier in the list of arguments to "autodie".  However the subroutine  in  question  does
           not have any hints available.

       See also "DIAGNOSTICS" in Fatal.

</pre><h4><b>Tips</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tricks</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Importing</b> <b>autodie</b> <b>into</b> <b>another</b> <b>namespace</b> <b>than</b> <b>"caller"</b>
       It  is possible to import autodie into a different namespace by using Import::Into.  However, you have to
       pass a "caller depth" (rather than a package name) for this to work correctly.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       "Used only once" warnings can be generated when "autodie" or "Fatal" is  used  with  package  filehandles
       (eg, "FILE").  Scalar filehandles are strongly recommended instead.

       When  using  "autodie" or "Fatal" with user subroutines, the declaration of those subroutines must appear
       before the first use of "Fatal" or "autodie", or have been exported from a  module.   Attempting  to  use
       "Fatal" or "autodie" on other user subroutines will result in a compile-time error.

       Due to a bug in Perl, "autodie" may "lose" any format which has the same name as an autodying built-in or
       function.

       "autodie" may not work correctly if used inside a file with a name that looks like a string eval, such as
       <u>eval</u> <u>(3)</u>.

   <b>autodie</b> <b>and</b> <b>string</b> <b>eval</b>
       Due to the current implementation of "autodie", unexpected results may be seen when used near or with the
       string version of eval.  <u>None</u> <u>of</u> <u>these</u> <u>bugs</u> <u>exist</u> <u>when</u> <u>using</u> <u>block</u> <u>eval</u>.

       Under  Perl  5.8  only,  "autodie"  <u>does</u>  <u>not</u> propagate into string "eval" statements, although it can be
       explicitly enabled inside a string "eval".

       Under Perl 5.10 only, using a string eval when "autodie" is in effect can cause the autodie behaviour  to
       leak  into  the  surrounding  scope.  This can be worked around by using a "no autodie" at the end of the
       scope to explicitly remove autodie's effects, or by avoiding the use of string eval.

       <u>None</u> <u>of</u> <u>these</u> <u>bugs</u> <u>exist</u> <u>when</u> <u>using</u> <u>block</u> <u>eval</u>.  The use of "autodie" with block eval is considered  good
       practice.
