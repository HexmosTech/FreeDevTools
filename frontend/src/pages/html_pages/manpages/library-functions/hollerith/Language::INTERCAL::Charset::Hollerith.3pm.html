       Charset::Hollerith - convert between INTERCAL variant of Hollerith and ASCII

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Charset::Hollerith qw(hollerith2ascii);

           my $a = hollerith2ascii "(Hollerith text)";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Charset::Hollerith</u> defines functions to convert between a subset of ASCII and a subset of nonstandard
       Hollerith (since there isn't such a thing as a standard Hollerith we defined our own variant which is
       guaranteed to be incompatible with all versions of Hollerith used by IBM hardware - however, for each
       character code we have used the code used by some (but not all) IBM card reader, if the code exists in
       Hollerith at all, or we have made one up in some logical way (such as overpunching) if no IBM hardware
       had that particular character.

       The two functions <u>hollerith2ascii</u> and <u>ascii2hollerith</u> are exportable but not exported by default. They do
       the obvious thing to their argument.

</pre><h4><b>HOLLERITH</b> <b>CHARACTER</b> <b>TABLE</b></h4><pre>
       A Hollerith string is a sequence of 12-bit characters; they are encoded as two ASCII characters,
       containing 6 bits each: the first character contains punches 12, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and the second character
       contains punches 11, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9; interleaving the two characters gives the original 12 bits.  To make
       the characters printable on ASCII terminals, bit 7 is always set to 0, and bit 6 is set to the complement
       of bit 5. These two bits are ignored when reading Hollerith cards.

       Some Hollerith characters (produced by overpunching) can be converted to sequences of ASCII characters;
       <u>ascii2hollerith</u> will correctly recognise the sequences.

       The following punched cards document the encoding of characters; the last card ends with nongraphic
       symbols in ASCII so the column heading contains a two-letter abbreviation instead, and with the two
       overpunch symbols we use, change and bookworm, whose column heading shows the two characters, "C/" and
       "V-" respectively:

       PLEASE NOTE that versions of CLC-INTERCAL before 1.-94.-2 had a bug which caused a rabbit to be
       represented as 12-3-2-8 instead of 12-3-7-8. Cards punched with such older versions, and containing
       rabbits, will need to be copied with one of the rabbit holes moved from row 2 to row 7.
