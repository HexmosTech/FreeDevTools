       Dpkg::BuildDriver - drive the build of a Debian package

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class is used by dpkg-buildpackage to drive the build of a Debian package.

       <b>Note</b>: This is a private module, its API can change at any time.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $bd = Dpkg::BuildDriver-&gt;new(%opts)
           Create a new Dpkg::BuildDriver object.  It will load a build driver module as requested in the <b>Build-</b>
           <b>Drivers</b>  field  in the $opts{ctrl} Dpkg::Control::Info object or if not present, it will fall back to
           load the default <b>debian-rules</b> driver.

           Options:

           <b>ctrl</b> (required)
               A Dpkg::Control::Info object.

           <b>root_cmd</b>
               A string with the gain-root-command to use when needing  to  execute  a  command  with  root-like
               rights.   If  needed and unset, it will default to fakeroot if it is available or the module will
               error out.

           <b>as_root</b>
               A boolean to force <u>debian/rules</u> target calls as  root-like,  even  if  they  would  normally  not
               require to be executed as root-like.  This option is applied to all targets globally.

               <b>Note</b>: This option is only relevant for drivers that use <u>debian/rules</u>.

           <b>debian_rules</b>
               An  array  containing  the command to execute the <u>debian/rules</u> file and any additional arguments.
               It defaults to <b>debian/rules</b>.

               <b>Note</b>: This option is only relevant for drivers that use <u>debian/rules</u>.

           <b>rrr_override</b>
               A string that overrides the <b>Rules-Requires-Root</b> field value.

               <b>Note</b>: This option is only relevant for drivers that use <u>debian/rules</u>.

       $bd-&gt;<b>pre_check()</b>
           Perform build driver specific checks, before anything else.

           This will run after the <b>init</b> hook, and before "dpkg-source --before-build".

           <b>Note</b>: This is an optional method that can be omitted from the driver implementation.

       $bool = $bd-&gt;need_build_task($build_task, binary_task)
           Returns whether we need to use the build task.

           <b>Note</b>: This method is needed as long as we support building as root-like.  Once  that  is  not  needed
           this method will be deprecated.

       $bd-&gt;run_build_task($build_task, $binary_task)
           Executes the build task for the build.

           <b>Note</b>:  This  is  an optional method needed as long as we support building as root-like.  Once that is
           not needed this method will be deprecated.

       $bd-&gt;run_task($task)
           Executes the given task for the build.
