</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Pinto::Command::unregister - remove packages from a stack

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.14

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         pinto --root=REPOSITORY_ROOT unregister [OPTIONS] TARGET ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       !! THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL !!

       This command unregisters packages from a stack, so that they no longer appear in its index.  However, the
       archives that contain the packages will remain in the repository.  When unregistering, all the sister
       packages in the same distribution are also unregistered.

       To permanently remove an archive from the repository, use the delete command. To re-register packages on
       a stack, use the register command.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments are the targets that you want to unregister.  Targets can be specified as packages (with or
       without version number) or distributions.  For example:

         Foo::Bar                                 # Unregisters any version of Foo::Bar
         Foo::Bar~1.2                             # Unregisters Foo::Bar 1.2 or higher
         SHAKESPEARE/King-Lear-1.2.tar.gz         # Unregisters a specific distribuion

       You can also pipe arguments to this command over STDIN.  In that case, blank lines and lines that look
       like comments (i.e. starting with "#" or ';') will be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --diff-style=STYLE
           Controls  the  style  of  the  diff  reports.  STYLE must be either "concise" or "detailed".  Concise
           reports show only one record for each distribution added  or  deleted.   Detailed  reports  show  one
           record for every package added or deleted.

           The   default   style  is  "concise".   However,  the  default  style  can  changed  by  setting  the
           "PINTO_DIFF_STYLE" environment variable to your preferred STYLE.  This variable affects  the  default
           style for diff reports generated by all other commands too.

       --dry-run
           Go  through  all  the  motions,  but  do not actually commit any changes to the repository.  Use this
           option to see how the command would potentially impact the stack.

       --force
           Unregister packages even if they are pinned to  the  stack.   Take  care  when  unregistering  pinned
           packages, as it usually means that particular package is important to someone.

       --message=TEXT
       -m TEXT
           Use  TEXT  as  the  revision  history  log  message.  If you do not use the "--message" option or the
           "--use-default-message" option, then you will be prompted to enter the message via your text  editor.
           Use the "PINTO_EDITOR" or "EDITOR" or "VISUAL" environment variables to control which editor is used.
           A  log message is not required whenever the "--dry-run" option is set, or if the action did not yield
           any changes to the repository.

       --stack=NAME
           Unregisters the targets from the stack with the given NAME.  Defaults to the name of whichever  stack
           is  currently  marked  as  the  default  stack.   Use  the  stacks  command  to see the stacks in the
           repository.

       --use-default-message
       -M  Use the default value for the revision history log message.  Pinto will generate  a  semi-informative
           log  message  just  based  on  the  command  and  its arguments.  If you set an explicit message with
           "--message", the "--use-default-message" option will be silently ignored.
