</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package Module::Package::Name;

           package Module::Package::Name::flavor;
           use Moo;
           extends 'Module::Package::Plugin';

           sub main {
               my ($self) = @_;
               $self-&gt;mi-&gt;some_module_install_author_plugin;
               $self-&gt;mi-&gt;other_author_plugin;
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is the base class for Module::Package plugins.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Take a look at the Module::Package::Ingy module, for a decent starting point example. That plugin module
       is actually used to package Module::Package itself.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       To create a Module::Package plugin you need to subclass Module::Package::Plugin and override the "main"
       method, and possibly other things. This section describes how that works.

       Makefile.PL processing happens in the following order:

           - 'use inc::Module::Package...' is invoked
           - $plugin-&gt;initial is called
           - BEGIN blocks in Makefile.PL are run
           - $plugin-&gt;main is called
           - The body of Makefile.PL is run
           - $plugin-&gt;final is called

   <b>initial</b>
       This method is call during the processing of 'use inc::Module::Package'. You probably don't need to
       subclass it. If you do you probably want to call the SUPER method.

       It runs the deps_list, if any and guesses the primary modules file path.

   <b>main</b>
       This is the method you must override. Do all the things you want. You can call "all_from", if you need to
       get sequencing right, otherwise it gets called by <b>final()</b>. Don't call "WriteAll", it get's called
       automatically in <b>final()</b>.

   <b>final</b>
       This does all the things after the entire Makefile.PL body has run. You probably don't need to override
       it.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are available for use from the Makefile.PL:

           use Module::Package 'Foo:bar',
               deps_list =&gt; 0|1,
               install_bin =&gt; 0|1,
               install_share =&gt; 0|1,
               manifest_skip =&gt; 0|1,
               requires_from =&gt; 0|1;

       These options can be used by any subclass of this module.

   <b>deps_list</b>
       Default is 1.

       This option tells Module::Package to generate a "author_requires" deps list, when you run the
       Makefile.PL. This list will go in the file "pkg/deps_list.pl" if that exists, or after a '__END__'
       statement in your Makefile.PL. If neither is available, a reminder will be warned (only when the author
       runs it).

       This list is important if you want people to be able to collaborate on your modules easily.

   <b>install_bin</b>
       Default is 1.

       All files in a "bin/" directory will be installed. It will call the "install_script" plugin for you. Set
       this option to 0 to disable it.

   <b>install_share</b>
       Default is 1.

       All files in a "share/" directory will be installed. It will call the "install_share" plugin for you. Set
       this option to 0 to disable it.

   <b>manifest_skip</b>
       Default is 1.

       This option will generate a sane MANIFEST.SKIP for you and delete it again when you run "make clean". You
       can add your own skips in the file called "pkg/manifest.skip". You almost certainly want this option on.
       Set to 0 if you are weird.

   <b>requires_from</b>
       Default is 1.

       This option will attempt to find all the requirements from the primary module.  If you make any of your
       own requires or requires_from calls, this option will do nothing.
