</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Pinto::Command::unpin - free packages that have been pinned

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.14

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         pinto --root=REPOSITORY_ROOT unpin [OPTIONS] TARGET ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command unpins package in the stack, so that the stack can be merged into another stack with a newer
       packages, or so the packages can be upgraded to a newer version within this stack.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments are the targets you wish to unpin.  Targets can be specified as packages or distributions, such
       as:

         Some::Package
         Some::Other::Package

         AUTHOR/Some-Dist-1.2.tar.gz
         AUTHOR/Some-Other-Dist-1.3.zip

       When unpinning a distribution, all the packages in that distribution become unpinned.  Likewise when
       unpinning a package, all its sister packages in the same distribution also become unpinned.

       You can also pipe arguments to this command over STDIN.  In that case, blank lines and lines that look
       like comments (i.e. starting with "#" or ';') will be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --diff-style=STYLE
           Controls  the  style  of  the  diff  reports.  STYLE must be either "concise" or "detailed".  Concise
           reports show only one record for each distribution added  or  deleted.   Detailed  reports  show  one
           record for every package added or deleted.

           The   default   style  is  "concise".   However,  the  default  style  can  changed  by  setting  the
           "PINTO_DIFF_STYLE" environment variable to your preferred STYLE.  This variable affects  the  default
           style for diff reports generated by all other commands too.

       --dry-run
           Go  through  all  the  motions,  but  do not actually commit any changes to the repository.  Use this
           option to see how the command would potentially impact the stack.

       --message=TEXT
       -m TEXT
           Use TEXT as the revision history log message.  If you do  not  use  the  "--message"  option  or  the
           "--use-default-message"  option, then you will be prompted to enter the message via your text editor.
           Use the "PINTO_EDITOR" or "EDITOR" or "VISUAL" environment variables to control which editor is used.
           A log message is not required whenever the "--dry-run" option is set, or if the action did not  yield
           any changes to the repository.

       --stack=NAME
           Unpins  the  package  on  the  stack with the given NAME.  Defaults to the name of whichever stack is
           currently marked as the default stack.  Use the stacks command to see your stacks.

       --use-default-message
       -M  Use the default value for the revision history log message.  Pinto will generate  a  semi-informative
           log  message  just  based  on  the  command  and  its arguments.  If you set an explicit message with
           "--message", the "--use-default-message" option will be silently ignored.
