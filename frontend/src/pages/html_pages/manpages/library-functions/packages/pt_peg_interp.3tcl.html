</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Are  you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In that case please read the overview
       provided by the <u>Introduction</u> <u>to</u> <u>Parser</u> <u>Tools</u>. This document is the entrypoint to  the  whole  system  the
       current package is a part of.

       This  package provides a class whose instances are Packrat parsers configurable with a parsing expression
       grammar. The grammar is executed directly, i.e. interpreted, with the underlying runtime provided by  the
       package <b>pt::rde</b>, basing everything on the PARAM.

       Like  the  supporting  runtime  this package resides in the Execution section of the Core Layer of Parser
       Tools.

       IMAGE: arch_core_transform

       The interpreted grammar is copied from an instance of <b>pt::peg::container</b>, or anything providing the  same
       API,  like  the  container  classes  created  by  <b>pt::peg::to::container</b>  or the associated export plugin
       <b>pt::peg::export::container</b>.

   <b>CLASS</b> <b>API</b>
       The package exports the API described here.

       <b>::pt::peg::interp</b> <u>objectName</u> <u>grammar</u>
              The command creates a new parser object and returns the fully qualified name of the object command
              as its result. The API of this object command is described in the section <b>Object</b> <b>API</b>.  It  may  be
              used to invoke various operations on the object.

              This  new  parser is configured for the execution of an empty PEG. To configure the object for any
              other PEG use the method <b>use</b> of the <b>Object</b> <b>API</b>.

   <b>OBJECT</b> <b>API</b>
       All objects created by this package provide the following methods.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>use</b> <u>grammar</u>
              This method configures the grammar interpreter / parser for the execution of  the  PEG  stored  in
              <u>grammar</u>,  an  object which is API-compatible to instances of <b>pt::peg::container</b>. The parser copies
              the relevant information of the grammar, and does <u>not</u> take ownership of the object.

              The information of any previously used grammar is overwritten.

              The result of the method the empty string.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>destroy</b>
              This method destroys the parser instance, releasing all claimed memory and  other  resources,  and
              deleting the instance command.

              The result of the command is the empty string.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>parse</b> <u>chan</u>
              This  method runs the parser using the contents of <u>chan</u> as input (starting at the current location
              in the channel), until parsing is not possible anymore, either because parsing has  completed,  or
              run into a syntax error.

              Note here that the Parser Tools are based on Tcl 8.5+. In other words, the channel argument is not
              restricted to files, sockets, etc. We have the full power of <u>reflected</u> <u>channels</u> available.

              It  should  also  be  noted that the parser pulls the characters from the input stream as it needs
              them. If a parser created by this package has to be operated in a push aka event-driven manner  it
              will  be necessary to go to Tcl 8.6+ and use the <b>coroutine::auto</b> to wrap it into a coroutine where
              <b>read</b> is properly changed for push-operation.

              Upon successful completion the command returns an abstract syntax tree as its result.  This AST is
              in the form specified in section <b>AST</b> <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>.  As a plain nested Tcl-list it can then
              be processed with any Tcl commands the user likes, doing transformations,  semantic  checks,  etc.
              To  help  in this the package <b>pt::ast</b> provides a set of convenience commands for validation of the
              tree's basic structure, printing it for debugging, and walking it either from the  bottom  up,  or
              top down.

              When  encountering  a  syntax error the command will throw an error instead.  This error will be a
              4-element Tcl-list, containing, in the order listed below:

              [1]    The string <b>pt::rde</b> identifying it as parser runtime error.

              [2]    The location of the parse error, as character offset  from  the  beginning  of  the  parsed
                     input.

              [3]    The  location  of parse error, now as a 2-element list containing line-number and column in
                     the line.

              [4]    A set of atomic parsing expressions indicating encoding the characters  and/or  nonterminal
                     symbols  the  parser  expected  to see at the location of the parse error, but did not get.
                     For the specification of atomic parsing expressions please see the section <b>PE</b> <b>serialization</b>
                     <b>format</b>.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>parset</b> <u>text</u>
              This method runs the parser using the string in <u>text</u> as input.  In all other ways it behaves  like
              the method <b>parse</b>, shown above.

</pre><h4><b>AST</b> <b>SERIALIZATION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here  we  specify  the  format  used  by  the  Parser  Tools to serialize Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) as
       immutable values for transport, comparison, etc.

       Each node in an AST represents a nonterminal symbol of a grammar, and the range of  tokens/characters  in
       the  input  covered  by  it.  ASTs  do not contain terminal symbols, i.e. tokens/characters. These can be
       recovered from the input given a symbol's location.

       We distinguish between <u>regular</u> and <u>canonical</u> serializations.  While a tree may have more than one regular
       serialization only exactly one of them will be <u>canonical</u>.

       Regular serialization

              [1]    The serialization of any AST is the serialization of its root node.

              [2]    The serialization of any node is a Tcl list containing at least three elements.

                     [1]    The first element is the name of the nonterminal symbol stored in the node.

                     [2]    The second and third element are the locations of the first and last  token  in  the
                            token stream the node represents (covers).

                            [1]    Locations  are provided as non-negative integer offsets from the beginning of
                                   the token stream, with the first token found in the stream located at  offset
                                   0 (zero).

                            [2]    The end location has to be equal to or larger than the start location.

                     [3]    All  elements  after  the  first three represent the children of the node, which are
                            themselves nodes. This means that the serializations of nodes without children, i.e.
                            leaf nodes, have exactly three elements.  The children are stored in the  list  with
                            the leftmost child first, and the rightmost child last.

       Canonical serialization
              The canonical serialization of an abstract syntax tree has the format as specified in the previous
              item,  and  then  additionally satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique among all the
              possible serializations of this tree.

              [1]    The string representation of the value is the canonical representation of a pure Tcl  list.
                     I.e. it does not contain superfluous whitespace.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       Assuming the parsing expression grammar below

              PEG calculator (Expression)
                  Digit      &lt;- '0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'       ;
                  Sign       &lt;- '-' / '+'                                     ;
                  Number     &lt;- Sign? Digit+                                  ;
                  Expression &lt;- Term (AddOp Term)*                            ;
                  MulOp      &lt;- '*' / '/'                                     ;
                  Term       &lt;- Factor (MulOp Factor)*                        ;
                  AddOp      &lt;- '+'/'-'                                       ;
                  Factor     &lt;- '(' Expression ')' / Number                   ;
              END;

       and the input string

               120+5
       then a parser should deliver the abstract syntax tree below (except for whitespace)

              set ast {Expression 0 4
                  {Factor 0 4
                      {Term 0 2
                          {Number 0 2
                              {Digit 0 0}
                              {Digit 1 1}
                              {Digit 2 2}
                          }
                      }
                      {AddOp 3 3}
                      {Term 4 4
                          {Number 4 4
                              {Digit 4 4}
                          }
                      }
                  }
              }

       Or, more graphical

       .nf  +-  Digit  0  0  |  1  |             |  +-  Term  0  2  ---  Number  0  2  -+-  Digit  1  1  |  2  |

       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Parsing Expressions as immutable  values
       for transport, comparison, etc.

       We  distinguish  between  <u>regular</u> and <u>canonical</u> serializations.  While a parsing expression may have more
       than one regular serialization only exactly one of them will be <u>canonical</u>.

              possible serializations of this parsing expression.

              [1]    The  string representation of the value is the canonical representation of a pure Tcl list.
                     I.e. it does not contain superfluous whitespace.

              [2]    Terminals are <u>not</u> encoded as ranges (where start and end of the range are identical).

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       Assuming the parsing expression shown on the right-hand side of the rule

                  Expression &lt;- Term (AddOp Term)*

       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is

                  {x {n Term} {* {x {n AddOp} {n Term}}}}
