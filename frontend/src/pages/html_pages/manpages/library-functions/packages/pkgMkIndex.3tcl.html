       pkg_mkIndex - Build an index for automatic loading of packages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pkg_mkIndex</b> ?<u>options...</u>? <u>dir</u> ?<u>pattern</u> <u>pattern</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Pkg_mkIndex</b>  is a utility procedure that is part of the standard Tcl library.  It is used to create index
       files that allow packages to be loaded automatically when <b>package</b> <b>require</b> commands are executed.  To  use
       <b>pkg_mkIndex</b>, follow these steps:

       [1]    Create  the package(s).  Each package may consist of one or more Tcl script files or binary files.
              Binary files must be suitable for loading with the <b>load</b>  command  with  a  single  argument;   for
              example,  if  the  file  is  <b>test.so</b>  it  must be possible to load this file with the command <b>load</b>
              <b>test.so</b>.  Each script file must contain a <b>package</b> <b>provide</b>  command  to  declare  the  package  and
              version number, and each binary file must contain a call to <b>Tcl_PkgProvide</b>.

       [2]    Create the index by invoking <b>pkg_mkIndex</b>.  The <u>dir</u> argument gives the name of a directory and each
              <u>pattern</u>  argument is a <b>glob</b>-style pattern that selects script or binary files in <u>dir</u>.  The default
              pattern is <b>*.tcl</b> and <b>*.[info</b> <b>sharedlibextension]</b>.

              <b>Pkg_mkIndex</b> will create a file <b>pkgIndex.tcl</b> in <u>dir</u> with package information about  all  the  files
              given  by  the  <u>pattern</u> arguments.  It does this by loading each file into a child interpreter and
              seeing what packages and new commands appear (this is why it is essential to have <b>package</b>  <b>provide</b>
              commands  or  <b>Tcl_PkgProvide</b> calls in the files, as described above).  If you have a package split
              among scripts and binary files, or if you have dependencies among files, you may have to  use  the
              <b>-load</b>  option  or  adjust  the  order in which <b>pkg_mkIndex</b> processes the files.  See <b>COMPLEX</b> <b>CASES</b>
              below.

       [3]    Install the package as a subdirectory of one of the directories given by the <b>tcl_pkgPath</b> variable.
              If <b>$tcl_pkgPath</b> contains more than one directory, machine-dependent  packages  (e.g.,  those  that
              contain  binary  shared  libraries)  should  normally  be  installed under the first directory and
              machine-independent packages (e.g., those that contain only Tcl scripts) should be installed under
              the second directory.  The subdirectory should include the package's script and/or binary files as
              well as the <b>pkgIndex.tcl</b> file.  As long as the  package  is  installed  as  a  subdirectory  of  a
              directory in <b>$tcl_pkgPath</b> it will automatically be found during <b>package</b> <b>require</b> commands.

              If  you  install the package anywhere else, then you must ensure that the directory containing the
              package is in the <b>auto_path</b> global variable or an immediate subdirectory of one of the directories
              in <b>auto_path</b>.  <b>Auto_path</b> contains a list of directories that are searched by both the  auto-loader
              and  the  package loader; by default it includes <b>$tcl_pkgPath</b>.  The package loader also checks all
              of the subdirectories of the directories in <b>auto_path</b>.  You  can  add  a  directory  to  <b>auto_path</b>
              explicitly  in  your  application,  or  you  can  add the directory to your <b>TCLLIBPATH</b> environment
              variable:  if this environment variable is present,  Tcl  initializes  <b>auto_path</b>  from  it  during
              application startup.

       [4]    Once  the  above  steps  have been taken, all you need to do to use a package is to invoke <b>package</b>
              <b>require</b>.  For example, if versions 2.1, 2.3,  and  3.1  of  package  <b>Test</b>  have  been  indexed  by
              <b>pkg_mkIndex</b>,  the  command  <b>package</b>  <b>require</b>  <b>Test</b> will make version 3.1 available and the command
              <b>package</b> <b>require</b> <b>-exact</b> <b>Test</b> <b>2.1</b> will make version 2.1 available.  There may be many versions of  a
              package  in  the various index files in <b>auto_path</b>, but only one will actually be loaded in a given
              interpreter, based on the first call to <b>package</b> <b>require</b>.  Different versions of a package  may  be
              loaded in different interpreters.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The optional switches are:

       <b>-direct</b>        The  generated  index  will  implement direct loading of the package upon <b>package</b> <b>require</b>.
                      This is the default.

       <b>-lazy</b>          The generated index will manage to delay loading the package until the use of one  of  the
                      commands  provided by the package, instead of loading it immediately upon <b>package</b> <b>require</b>.
                      This is not compatible with the use of <u>auto_reset</u>, and therefore its use is discouraged.

       <b>-load</b> <u>pkgPat</u>   The index process will preload any packages that exist  in  the  current  interpreter  and
                      match  <u>pkgPat</u>  into  the  child interpreter used to generate the index.  The pattern match
                      uses string match rules, but without making case distinctions.  See <b>COMPLEX</b> <b>CASES</b> below.

       <b>-verbose</b>       Generate output during the indexing process.  Output is via the <b>tclLog</b> procedure, which by
                      default prints to stderr.

       <b>--</b>             End of the flags, in case <u>dir</u> begins with a dash.

</pre><h4><b>PACKAGES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>THE</b> <b>AUTO-LOADER</b></h4><pre>
       The package management facilities overlap somewhat with the auto-loader, in that both arrange  for  files
       to  be  loaded  on-demand.   However,  package management is a higher-level mechanism that uses the auto-
       loader for the last step in the loading process.   It  is  generally  better  to  index  a  package  with
       <b>pkg_mkIndex</b>  rather  than  <b>auto_mkindex</b>  because the package mechanism provides version control:  several
       versions of a package can be made available  in  the  index  files,  with  different  applications  using
       different  versions  based  on  <b>package</b>  <b>require</b> commands.  In contrast, <b>auto_mkindex</b> does not understand
       versions so it can only handle a single version of each package.  It is probably not a good idea to index
       a given package with both <b>pkg_mkIndex</b> and <b>auto_mkindex</b>.  If you use <b>pkg_mkIndex</b> to index a  package,  its
       commands  cannot  be  invoked  until  <b>package</b>  <b>require</b>  has  been used to select a version;  in contrast,
       packages indexed with <b>auto_mkindex</b> can be used immediately since there is no version control.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>IT</b> <b>WORKS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Pkg_mkIndex</b> depends on the <b>package</b> <b>unknown</b> command, the <b>package</b> <b>ifneeded</b> command,  and  the  auto-loader.
       The  first time a <b>package</b> <b>require</b> command is invoked, the <b>package</b> <b>unknown</b> script is invoked.  This is set
       by Tcl initialization to a script that evaluates all of the <b>pkgIndex.tcl</b> files  in  the  <b>auto_path</b>.   The
       <b>pkgIndex.tcl</b>  files  contain <b>package</b> <b>ifneeded</b> commands for each version of each available package;  these
       commands invoke <b>package</b> <b>provide</b> commands to announce the availability of  the  package,  and  they  setup
       auto-loader  information  to  load  the  files  of  the package.  If the <b>-lazy</b> flag was provided when the
       <b>pkgIndex.tcl</b> was generated, a given file of a given version of a given package  is  not  actually  loaded
       until  the  first  time one of its commands is invoked.  Thus, after invoking <b>package</b> <b>require</b> you may not
       see the package's commands in the interpreter, but you will be able to invoke the commands and they  will
       be auto-loaded.

</pre><h4><b>DIRECT</b> <b>LOADING</b></h4><pre>
       Some  packages,  for  instance  packages  which use namespaces and export commands or those which require
       special initialization, might select that their package files be loaded immediately upon <b>package</b>  <b>require</b>
       instead  of  delaying  the  actual  loading to the first use of one of the package's command. This is the
       default mode when generating the package index.  It can be overridden by specifying the <b>-lazy</b> argument.

</pre><h4><b>COMPLEX</b> <b>CASES</b></h4><pre>
       Most complex cases of dependencies among scripts and binary files, and packages being split among scripts
       and binary files are handled OK.  However, you may have to adjust the order in which files are  processed
       by <b>pkg_mkIndex</b>.  These issues are described in detail below.

       If each script or file contains one package, and packages are only contained in one file, then things are
       easy.  You simply specify all files to be indexed in any order with some glob patterns.

       In  general,  it  is  OK  for scripts to have dependencies on other packages.  If scripts contain <b>package</b>
       <b>require</b> commands, these are stubbed out in the interpreter used to process the scripts, so these  do  not
       cause  problems.   If  scripts call into other packages in global code, these calls are handled by a stub
       <b>unknown</b> command.  However, if scripts make variable references to other  package's  variables  in  global
       code, these will cause errors.  That is also bad coding style.

       If  binary files have dependencies on other packages, things can become tricky because it is not possible
       to stub out C-level APIs such as <b>Tcl_PkgRequire</b> API when loading a binary file.  For example, suppose the
       BLT package requires Tk, and expresses this with a call to <b>Tcl_PkgRequire</b> in its  <b>Blt_Init</b>  routine.   To
       support  this,  you must run <b>pkg_mkIndex</b> in an interpreter that has Tk loaded.  You can achieve this with
       the <b>-load</b> <u>pkgPat</u> option.  If you specify this option, <b>pkg_mkIndex</b> will load any packages listed  by  <b>info</b>
       <b>loaded</b> and that match <u>pkgPat</u> into the interpreter used to process files.  In most cases this will satisfy
       the <b>Tcl_PkgRequire</b> calls made by binary files.

       If  you  are  indexing two binary files and one depends on the other, you should specify the one that has
       dependencies last.  This way the one without dependencies will get  loaded  and  indexed,  and  then  the
       package  it  provides will be available when the second file is processed.  You may also need to load the
       first package into the temporary interpreter used to create the index by using the <b>-load</b>  flag;  it  will
       not hurt to specify package patterns that are not yet loaded.

       If  you  have  a  package that is split across scripts and a binary file, then you should avoid the <b>-load</b>
       flag. The problem is that if you load a package before computing the index it masks any other files  that
       provide  part  of  the  same  package.   If  you must use <b>-load</b>, then you must specify the scripts first;
       otherwise the package loaded from the binary file may mask the package defined by the scripts.
