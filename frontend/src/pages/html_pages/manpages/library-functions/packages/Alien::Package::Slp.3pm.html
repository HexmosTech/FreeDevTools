</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Alien::Package::Slp - an object that represents a slp package

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is an object class that represents a slp package. It is derived from Alien::Package.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       The following data is global to the class, and is used to describe the slp package format, which this
       class processes directly.

       footer_size
           Complete sizeof(slpformat) from slp.h in the stampede package manager source.

       footer_packstring
           This is the pack format string for the footer. (A=space terminated character, I=unsigned integer.)

       footer_version
           What package format are we up to now? (Lowest one this is still compatible with.)

       archtrans
           This  is  a  translation  table  between  architectures  and the number that represents them in a slp
           package.

       fieldlist
           This is a list of all the fields in the order they appear in the footer.

</pre><h4><b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       compresstype
           Holds the compression type used in the slp file.

       slpkgversion
           Holds the slp package format version of the slp file.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       checkfile
           Detect slp files by their extension.

       install
           Install a slp. Pass in the filename of the slp to install.

       getfooter
           Pulls the footer out of the slp file and returns it.

       scan
           Implement the scan method to read a slp file.

       unpack
           Unpack a slp file. They can be compressed in various ways, depending on what is in  the  compresstype
           field.

       build
           Build a slp.

       conffiles
           Set/get conffiles.

           When  the  conffiles are set, the format used by slp (a colon-delimited list) is turned into the real
           list that is used internally. The list is  changed  back  into  slp's  internal  format  when  it  is
           retrieved.

       copyright
           Set/get copyright.

           When  the  copyright  is  set,  the number used by slp is changed into a textual description. This is
           changed back into a number when the value is retrieved.

       arch
           Set/get arch.

           When the arch is set, the number used by slp is changed into a textual description. This  is  changed
           back into a number when the value is retrieved.

       release
           Set/get release version.

           When  the release version is retrieved, it is converted to an unsigned integer, as is required by the
           slp package format.
