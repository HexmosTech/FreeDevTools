</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Are  you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In that case please read the overview
       provided by the <u>Introduction</u> <u>to</u> <u>Parser</u> <u>Tools</u>. This document is the entrypoint to  the  whole  system  the
       current package is a part of.

       This  package  provides  additional  commands  to  work with the serializations of parsing expressions as
       managed by the PEG and related packages, and specified in section <b>PE</b> <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>.

       This is an internal package, for use by the higher level packages handling PEGs,  their  conversion  into
       and out of various other formats, or other uses.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       <b>::pt::pe::op</b> <b>drop</b> <u>dropset</u> <u>pe</u>
              This command removes all occurences of any of the nonterminals symbols in the set <u>dropset</u> from the
              parsing  expression  <u>pe</u>,  and simplifies it. This may result in the expression becoming "epsilon",
              i.e. matching nothing.

       <b>::pt::pe::op</b> <b>rename</b> <u>nt</u> <u>ntnew</u> <u>pe</u>
              This command renames all occurences of the nonterminal <u>nt</u> in the parsing expression <u>pe</u> into <u>ntnew</u>.

       <b>::pt::pe::op</b> <b>called</b> <u>pe</u>
              This command extracts the set of all nonterminal symbols  used,  i.e.  'called',  in  the  parsing
              expression <u>pe</u>.

       <b>::pt::pe::op</b> <b>flatten</b> <u>pe</u>
              This  command  transforms the parsing expression by eliminating sequences nested in sequences, and
              choices in choices, lifting the children of the nested expression  into  the  parent.  It  further
              eliminates all sequences and choices with only one child, as these are redundant.

              The resulting parsing expression is returned as the result of the command.

       <b>::pt::pe::op</b> <b>fusechars</b> <u>pe</u>
              This  command  transforms  the  parsing  expression  by fusing adjacent terminals in sequences and
              adjacent terminals and ranges in  choices,  it  (re)constructs  highlevel  <u>strings</u>  and  <u>character</u>
              <u>classes</u>.

              The  resulting  pseudo-parsing expression is returned as the result of the command and may contain
              the pseudo-operators <b>str</b> for character sequences, aka strings, and <b>cl</b> for character  choices,  aka
              character classes.

              The  result  is  called  a  <u>pseudo-parsing</u>  <u>expression</u> because it is not a true parsing expression
              anymore, and will fail a check with <b>::pt::peg</b> <b>verify</b> if the new pseudo-operators  are  present  in
              the  result,  but is otherwise of sound structure for a parsing expression.  Notably, the commands
              <b>::pt::peg</b> <b>bottomup</b> and <b>::pt::peg</b> <b>topdown</b> will process them without trouble.

</pre><h4><b>PE</b> <b>SERIALIZATION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Parsing Expressions as immutable  values
       for transport, comparison, etc.

       We  distinguish  between  <u>regular</u> and <u>canonical</u> serializations.  While a parsing expression may have more
       than one regular serialization only exactly one of them will be <u>canonical</u>.

                     [1]    For  parsing  expressions <b>e1</b>, <b>e2</b>, ... the result of [list / <b>e1</b> <b>e2</b> ... ] is a parsing
                            expression as well.  This is the <u>ordered</u> <u>choice</u>, aka <u>prioritized</u> <u>choice</u>.

                     [2]    For parsing expressions <b>e1</b>, <b>e2</b>, ... the result of [list x <b>e1</b> <b>e2</b> ... ] is  a  parsing
                            expression as well.  This is the <u>sequence</u>.

                     [3]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list * <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>kleene</u> <u>closure</u>, describing zero or more repetitions.

                     [4]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list + <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>positive</u> <u>kleene</u> <u>closure</u>, describing one or more repetitions.

                     [5]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list &amp; <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>and</u> <u>lookahead</u> <u>predicate</u>.

                     [6]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list ! <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>not</u> <u>lookahead</u> <u>predicate</u>.

                     [7]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list ? <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>optional</u> <u>input</u>.

       Canonical serialization
              The  canonical  serialization  of a parsing expression has the format as specified in the previous
              item, and then additionally satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique  among  all  the
              possible serializations of this parsing expression.

              [1]    The  string representation of the value is the canonical representation of a pure Tcl list.
                     I.e. it does not contain superfluous whitespace.

              [2]    Terminals are <u>not</u> encoded as ranges (where start and end of the range are identical).

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       Assuming the parsing expression shown on the right-hand side of the rule

                  Expression &lt;- Term (AddOp Term)*

       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is

                  {x {n Term} {* {x {n AddOp} {n Term}}}}
