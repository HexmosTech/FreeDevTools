</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Alien::Package::Rpm - an object that represents a rpm package

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is an object class that represents a rpm package. It is derived from Alien::Package.

</pre><h4><b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       prefixes
           Relocatable rpm packages have a prefixes field.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       checkfile
           Detect rpm files by their extension.

       install
           Install a rpm. If RPMINSTALLOPT is set in the environment, the options in it are passed to rpm on its
           command line.

       scan
           Implement the scan method to read a rpm file.

       unpack
           Implement  the  unpack  method  to unpack a rpm file. This is a little nasty because it has to handle
           relocatable rpms and has to do a bit of permissions fixing as well.

       prep
           Prepare for package building by generating the spec file.

       cleantree
           Delete the spec file.

       build
           Build a rpm. If RPMBUILDOPT is set in the environment, the options in it are passed  to  rpm  on  its
           command line.

           An  optional  parameter,  if  passed,  can be used to specify the program to use to build the rpm. It
           defaults to rpmbuild.

       version
           Set/get version.

           When retreiving the version, remove any dashes in it.

       postinst
       postrm
       preinst
       prerm
           Set/get script fields.

           When retrieving a value, we have to do some truly sick mangling. Since debian/slackware  scripts  can
           be  anything -- perl programs or binary files -- and rpm is limited to only shell scripts, we need to
           encode the files and add a scrap of shell script to make it unextract and run on the fly.

           When setting a value, we do some mangling too. Rpm maintainer scripts are  typically  shell  scripts,
           but  often lack the leading shebang line.  This can confuse dpkg, so add the shebang if it looks like
           there is no shebang magic already in place.

           Additionally, it's not uncommon for  rpm  maintainer  scripts  to  contain  bashisms,  which  can  be
           triggered  when  they  are ran on systems where <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> is not bash. To work around this, the shebang
           line of the scripts is changed to use bash.

           Also, if the rpm is relocatable, the script could refer to RPM_INSTALL_PREFIX, which is set by rpm at
           run time. Deal with this by adding code to the script to set RPM_INSTALL_PREFIX.

       arch
           Set/get arch field. When the arch field is set, some sanitizing is done first to convert  it  to  the
           debian  format used internally. When it's retrieved it's converted back to rpm form from the internal
           form.
