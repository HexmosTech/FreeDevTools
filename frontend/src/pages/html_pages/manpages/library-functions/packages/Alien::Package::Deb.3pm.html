</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Alien::Package::Deb - an object that represents a deb package

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is an object class that represents a deb package. It is derived from Alien::Package.

</pre><h4><b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       have_dpkg_deb
           Set to a true value if dpkg-deb is available.

       deb_member_list
           Set to the list of member names in the deb package.

       dirtrans
           After  the  build  stage,  set  to a hash reference of the directories we moved files from and to, so
           these moves can be reverted in the cleantree stage.

       fixperms
           If this is set to true, the generated debian/rules will run dh_fixperms.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       init
           Sets have_dpkg_deb if dpkg-deb is in the path. I prefer to use dpkg-deb, if it is available since  it
           is a lot more future-proof.

       checkfile
           Detect deb files by their extension.

       install
           Install a deb with dpkg. Pass in the filename of the deb to install.

       test
           Test a deb with lintian. Pass in the filename of the deb to test.

       get_deb_member_list
           Helper method. Pass it the name of the deb and it will return the list of ar members.

       getcontrolfile
           Helper method. Pass it the name of a control file, and it will pull it out of the deb and return it.

       get_datamember_cmd
           Helper  method.  Pass it the name of the deb and it will return the raw command needed to extract the
           data.tar member.

       scan
           Implement the scan method to read a deb file.

       unpack
           Implement the unpack method to unpack a deb file.

       getpatch
           This method tries to find a patch file to use in the prep stage. If it finds one, it returns it. Pass
           in a list of directories to search for patches in.

       prep
           Adds a populated debian directory the unpacked package tree, making it ready for building.  This  can
           either be done automatically, or via a patch file.

       build
           Build a deb.

       cleantree
           Delete the entire debian/ directory.

       package
           Set/get package name.

           Always returns the package name in lowercase with all invalid characters rmoved. The name is however,
           stored unchanged.

       version
           Set/get package version.

           When the version is set, it will be stripped of any epoch. If there is a release, the release will be
           stripped  away and used to set the release field as a side effect. Otherwise, the release will be set
           to 1.

           More sanitization of the version is done when the field is retrieved, to make  sure  it  is  a  valid
           debian version field.

       release
           Set/get package release.

           Always returns a sanitized release version. The release is however, stored unchanged.

       description
           Set/get description

           Although  the description is stored internally unchanged, this will always return a sanitized form of
           it that is compliant with Debian standards.

       date
           Returns the date, in rfc822 format.

       email
           Returns an email address for the current user.

       username
           Returns the user name of the real uid.

       savescript
           Saves script to debian directory.

       gen_postinst
           Modifies or creates a postinst. This may include generated shell code to set owners and  groups  from
           the owninfo field, and update modes from the modeinfo field.
