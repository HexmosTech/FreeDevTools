</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cryptopANT - IP Address Anonymization Library

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;cryptopANT.h&gt;</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  cryptopANT  ip  address  anonymization  library  implements  techniques  for  IPv4  and IPv6 address
       anonymization first described in:

       'Prefix-Preserving IP  Address Anonymization',
                Computer Networks, Volume 46, Issue 2, 7 October 2004, Pages 253-272, Elsevier.

       commonly known as Crypto-PAn.

       This implementation is provided by USC/ISI ANT project: <b><a href="http://ant.isi.edu">http://ant.isi.edu</a></b>

   <b>API</b> <b>Overview</b>
       <b>int</b> <b>scramble_init_from_file(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*keyfile,</b> <b>scramble_crypt_t</b> <b>c4,</b> <b>scramble_crypt_t</b> <b>c6,</b> <b>int</b> <b>*do_mac)</b>

              Initializes library from a keyfile and sets up underlying cryptographical mechanism for scrambling
              of IPv4 (c4) and IPv6 (c6) addresses.  See <b>scramble_crypt_t</b> for possible  values  of  c4  and  c6.
              Typically  used are: <b>SCRAMBLE_NONE</b> for no scrambling or <b>SCRAMBLE_AES</b> for scrambling using fast AES
              cypher.  If  the  keyfile  does  not  exist,  it  is  created.   This  function  internally  calls
              <b>scramble_readstate()</b>  and  <b>scrable_init().</b>   Returns  0  if  successful.   <b>SCRAMBLE_BLOWFISH</b>  uses
              blowfish cypher.  While previously widely used, it's no longer recommended, as scrambling of  ipv6
              addresses can be very slow.

       <b>int32_t</b>   <b>scramble_ip4(uint32_t</b> <b>input,</b> <b>int</b> <b>pass_bits)</b>
       <b>int32_t</b> <b>unscramble_ip4(uint32_t</b> <b>input,</b> <b>int</b> <b>pass_bits)</b>

              Scrambles  or  un-scrambles (input) IP address passing through first (pass_bits); the scrambled ip
              address is returned.  Please note that even if (pass_bits) is 0, first few  bits  will  be  passed
              through  to  preserve class of the input IP.  Both input and output IPs are in network byte order.
              Note that unscrambling is a  costly  operation  and  unscrambling  a  large  number  of  different
              addresses can take a long time.

       <b>void</b>   <b>scramble_ip6(struct</b> <b>in6_addr</b> <b>*input,</b> <b>int</b> <b>pass_bits)</b>
       <b>void</b> <b>unscramble_ip6(struct</b> <b>in6_addr</b> <b>*input,</b> <b>int</b> <b>pass_bits)</b>

              Scrambles  or  un-scrambles  IPv6  address  pointed to by (input) <b>in-place</b> , passing through first
              (pass_bits).  Addresses are in network byte order.  Note that unscrambling is a  costly  operation
              and unscrambling a large number of different addresses can take a long time.

       <b>int</b> <b>scramble_readstate(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*keyfile,</b> <b>scramble_state_t</b> <b>*s)</b>
       <b>int</b> <b>scramble_savestate(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*keyfile,</b> <b>const</b> <b>scramble_state_t</b> <b>*s)</b>

              These functions can read scrambling keys from keyfile into memory pointed to by (s), or save/write
              previously  initialized state (s) to a (keyfile).  After state is read, the library still needs to
              be initialized by calling <b>scramble_init()</b> Return 0 on success.

       <b>int</b> <b>scramble_init(const</b> <b>scramble_state_t</b> <b>*s)</b>

              Initializes library using state pointed by (s).  Returns 0 on success.
