</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Games::Go::Sgf2Dg - convert Smart Go Format (SGF) files to diagrams similar to those seen in Go books and
       magazines.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       sgf2dg [ option ... ] file[.sgf|.mgt]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Games::Go::Sgf2Dg</b> takes a Smart Go Format (SGF) file <u>filename</u> or <u>filename</u>.sgf or <u>filename</u>.mgt and
       produces a diagram file <u>filename</u>.suffix where suffix is determined by the <b>converter</b> (see below).

       <b>Games::Go::Sgf2Dg</b> modualizes the sgf2dg script.  As such, it parses the command line (<b>@ARGV</b>) directly,
       and has only one callable method: <b>run</b>, called as follows (by the sgf2dg script):

           Games::Go::Sgf2Dg-&gt;run;

       The default <b>converter</b> is Dg2TeX which converts the Diagram to TeX source code (sgf2dg is a superset
       replacement for the sgf2tex script and package).  If you have the GOOE fonts (provided in the same
       package as sgf2dg) correctly installed on your system you will be able to tex <u>filename</u>.tex to produce a
       .dvi file.  You can of course embed all or parts of <u>filename</u>.tex into other TeX documents.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>  | <b>-help</b>
           Print a help message and quit.

       <b>-i</b> | <b>-in</b>  &lt;filename&gt; | &lt;filename&gt;.sgf | &lt;filename&gt;.mgt
           Specifies  the  input  filename.  (STDIN  or  none for standard input.)  This option is not needed in
           ordinary use.

       <b>-o</b> | <b>-out</b> &lt;filename&gt;
           Specifies the output file.  ('STDOUT'  for  standard  output.)  If  the  input  file  is  &lt;filename&gt;,
           &lt;filename&gt;.sgf  or  &lt;filename&gt;.mgt,  then  &lt;filename&gt;.<u>converter</u>  is  the  default  (see the <b>converter</b>
           option).  This option is not needed in ordinary usage.

       <b>-t</b> | <b>-top</b> &lt;top line number&gt;
           Specifies the top line to print. Default is 1.

       <b>-b</b> | <b>-bottom</b> &lt;bottom line number&gt;
           Specifies the bottom line to print. Default is 19.

       <b>-l</b> | <b>-left</b> &lt;left line number&gt;
           Specifies the leftmost line to print. Default is 1.

       <b>-r</b> | <b>-right</b> &lt;right line number&gt;
           Specifies the rightmost line to print. Default is 19.

       <b>-break</b> | <b>-breakList</b> &lt;break list&gt;
           'break list' is a list of moves, separated by comma, with no spaces. These are breakpoints: each will
           be the last move in one diagram.

       <b>-m</b> | <b>-movesPerDiagram</b> &lt;moves per diagram&gt;
           'moves per diagram' is a positive integer, specifying  the  maximal  number  of  moves  per  diagram.
           Default  is  50  unless <b>-break</b> or <b>-breakList</b> is set, in which case the default is set to a very large
           number (10,000). The two options <b>-breakList</b> and <b>-movesPerDiagram</b> may be used together.

       <b>-n</b> | <b>-newNumbers</b>
           Begin each diagram with the number 1. The actual move numbers are still used in the label.

           <b>-newNumbers</b> and <b>-doubleDigits</b> are  alternative  schemes  for  avoiding  three-digit  numbers  in  the
           diagrams. They should probably not be used together.

       <b>-d</b> | <b>-doubleDigits</b>
           If  the  first  move of a diagram exceeds 100, the move number is reduced modulo 100. The actual move
           numbers are still used in the label.  <b>-newNumbers</b>  and  <b>-doubleDigits</b>  are  alternative  schemes  for
           avoiding three-digit numbers in the diagrams. They should probably not be used together.

       <b>-rl</b> | <b>-repeatLast</b>
           The  last  move  in  each  diagram  is  the  first move in the next. This emulates a common style for
           annotating Go games.

       <b>-ic</b> | <b>-ignoreComments</b>
           Comments embedded in the SGF with the C property are ignored.

       <b>-il</b> | <b>-ignoreLetters</b>
           Letters embedded in the SGF with the L or LB property are ignored.

       <b>-im</b> | <b>-ignoreMarks</b>
           Marks embedded in the SGF with the M or MA property are ignored.

       <b>-ip</b> | <b>-ignorePass</b>
           Passes are ignored. In sgf, a pass is a move at the fictitious point tt.  Without this option, sgf2dg
           indicates passes in the diagram comments.

       <b>-ia</b> | <b>-ignore</b> <b>all</b>
           Ignore SGF letters, marks, variations and passes.

       <b>-firstDiagram</b> &lt;diagram number&gt;
           Specifies the first diagram to print. Default is 1.

       <b>-lastDiagram</b> &lt;diagram number&gt;
           Specifies the last diagram to print. Default is to print all diagrams until the end.

       <b>-coords</b>
           Adds coordinates to right and bottom edges.

       <b>-verbose</b>
           Print diagnostic messages as the conversion proceeds.  Most  SGF  properties  produce  some  kind  of
           message.

       <b>-converter</b> | <b>-convert</b>
           Selects  different  output  converter  plugins.   Converters  available with the current distribution
           package are:

           Games::Go::Sgf2Dg::Dg2TeX       TeX source (default)
           Games::Go::Sgf2Dg::Dg2Mp        MetaPost embedded in TeX
           Games::Go::Sgf2Dg::Dg2ASCII     simple ASCII diagrams
           Games::Go::Sgf2Dg::Dg2PDF       Portable Document Format (PDF)
           Games::Go::Sgf2Dg::Dg2Ps        PostScript
           Games::Go::Sgf2Dg::Dg2Tk        Perl/Tk NoteBook/Canvas
           Games::Go::Sgf2Dg::Dg2TkPs      PostScript via Dg2Tk (Dg2Ps is prefered)
           Games::Go::Sgf2Dg::Dg2SL        Sensei's Library (by Marcel Gruenauer)

           <b>converter</b>s are quite easy to write - should take just a few hours if you are already conversant  with
           the  conversion  target.   If  you would like to create a <b>converter</b> plugin module, the easiest way is
           probably to grab a copy of Dg2Ps.pm (for example) and modify it.  Once it's working, please  be  sure
           to send us a copy so we can add it to the distribution.

           Converters  are  always  prepended  with  'Games::Go::Sgf2Dg::Dg2',  so to select the ASCII converter
           instead of the default TeX converter, use:

               -converter ASCII

           Converter names are case sensitive.

           The default output filename suffix is determined by the converter: the converter name is  lower-cased
           to become the suffix, so the ASCII converter produces &lt;filename&gt;.ascii from &lt;filename&gt;.sgf.

           You  can  also select different <b>converter</b>s by changing the name of the sgf2dg script (or better, make
           symbolic links, or copies if your system can't handle links).  The <b>converter</b> name is  extracted  from
           the name with this regular expression:

               m/sgf2(.*)/

           Anything  after  'sgf2' is assumed to be the name of a <b>converter</b> module.  For example, let's create a
           link to the script:

               $ cd <a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>
               $ ln -s sgf2dg sgf2Xyz

           Executing:

               $ sgf2Xyz foo.sgf [ options ]

           attempts to use Games::Go::Sgf2Dg::Dg2Xyz as the <b>converter</b>.  The <b>converter</b> name  extracted  from  the
           script name is case sensitive.

           Note that three extracted names are treated specially:

           tex
           diagram
           dg

           These   three   names   (when   extracted   from   the   script   name)   always   attempt   to   use
           Games::Go::Sgf2Dg::Dg2TeX as the <b>converter</b>.

</pre><h4><b>CONVERTER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Converters may be added dynamically as plugins, so this list only includes converter plugin modules  that
       are included with the Sgf2Dg distribution.

       Converter   options   are   prepended   with  the  converter  name  so  that  option  xyz  for  converter
       Games::Go::Sgf2Dg::Dg2Abc is written on the command line as:

           $ sgf2dg ... -Abc-xyz ...

       Converter options that take arguments must be quoted  so  that  the  shell  passes  the  option  and  any
       arguments as a single ARGV.  For example, if the xyz option for converter Dg2Abc takes 'foo' and 'bar' as
       additional arguments, the command line would be:

           $ sgf2dg ... "-Abc-xyz foo bar" ...

       or a more realistic example of changing the background color:

           $ sgf2dg genan-shuwa -converter Tk "-Tk-bg #d2f1b4bc8c8b"

       Since  Sgf2Dg  is  a  super-set  replacement  for the Sgf2TeX package, TeX holds the default position for
       converters.  Because of this historically priviledged position, the Dg2TeX options below do not  need  to
       be prepended with 'TeX-'.  All of the following options apply to the Dg2TeX converter.

       Other  plugins  available  at  the time of release are Dg2Mp, Dg2ASCII, Dg2PDF, Dg2Ps, Dg2Tk and Dg2TkPs.
       Dg2ASCII and Dg2TkPs take no additional  options.   Dg2Tk  doesn't  explicitly  accept  options,  but  it
       attempts  to  pass  unrecognized  options  to  the  Tk::Canvas widgets at creation time (which is why the
       example above works).

       For more information about converter-specific options, please refer to the perldoc or manual pages:

           $ perldoc Games::Go::Sgf2Dg::Dg2PDF

       or

           $ man Games::Go::Sgf2Dg::Dg2Ps

   <b>Dg2TeX</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-simple</b>
           (Dg2TeX) This generates very simple TeX which may not look so good on the page, but is convenient  if
           you intend to edit the TeX.

       <b>-mag</b> <b>number</b>
           (Dg2TeX) Changes the default \\magnification from 1000 to number.

       <b>-twoColumn</b>
           (Dg2TeX) This generates a two-column format using smaller fonts.

       <b>-bigFonts</b>
           (Dg2TeX) Use fonts magnified 1.2 times.

       <b>-texComments</b>
           (Dg2TeX)  If this option is NOT used then the characters {, } and \ found in comments are replaced by
           [, ] and /, since TeX roman fonts do not have  these  characters.  If  this  option  is  used,  these
           substitutions are not made, so you can embed TeX source (like {\bf change fonts}) directly inside the
           comments.

       <b>-floatControl</b> <b>'control_string'</b>
           (Dg2TeX)  Dg2TeX  can  float  the  diagram  to  the  left  or  the  right  of  the accompanying text.
           <b>-floatControl</b> allows you to specify the position of each diagram.  <b>control_string</b> is  a  sequence  of
           letters which specify where each diagram should be positioned.  The letters may be:

           'l': left
           'r': right
           'a': alternate
           other: random

           <b>control_string</b> letters are consumed, one per diagram, until there is only one letter left.  The final
           letter is used for all remaining diagrams.

           The default <b>control_string</b> is 'rx' which places the first diagram on the right (text on the left) and
           all remaining diagrams are placed randomly.
