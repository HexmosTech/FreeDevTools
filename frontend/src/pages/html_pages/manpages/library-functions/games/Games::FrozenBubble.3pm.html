</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Games::FrozenBubble - arcade/reflex game - THIS IS A BETA VERSION

</pre><h4><b>TIPS</b></h4><pre>
       During net/lan game choose, there is a chat system. Here are the available keys and tips:

       just type and hit enter to send a message
       page up and page down allow you to view history as in IRC programs
       arrow up and down allow you to recall previous messages you've sent
       the TAB key triggers nick completion on listening players
       in the pre-game chat, the following commands are available:
               /me &lt;action&gt;: sends an action message instead of sending a regular message
               /nick &lt;new_nick&gt;: change your nick
               /server: query the name of the server you're connected to
               /fs: toggle fullscreen
               /list: view list of listening players
               /geolocate: geolocate yourself again
               /autokick &lt;nick&gt; [&lt;text&gt;]: add/remove that nick to autokick list

       in the in-game chat, the following commands are available:
               /kick &lt;nick&gt; [&lt;text&gt;]: kick a joiner from your game (if you're
                                      creator), optionally with an explanatory text

       During a game, the following default key shortcuts are available:

       TAB: next playlist music (if sound available and when playlist is used)
       F11: toggle music
       F12: toggle sound
       Keypad Minus: lower music/sound volume
       Keypad Plus: raise music/sound volume

       When in multiplayer with 3+ players:

       F1: send malus to top left player
       F2: send malus to top right player
       F3: send malus to bottom left player
       F4: send malus to bottom right player
       F10: send malus to all opponents

       Notice:  you  can  see who you attack because the F1..F4 little text next to the player turns white - you
       can see who is attacking by the presence of the small pinguins of the opponent on the left of your igloo.

</pre><h4><b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Having</b> <b>problems</b> <b>running</b> <b>Frozen</b> <b>Bubble?</b>
       If you are colourblind, we already  have  what  you're  looking  for:  please  use  the  "-cb"commandline
       parameter, and bubbles will be printed with little geometrical symbols inside.

   <b>Fix</b> <b>your</b> <b>problems</b>
       Most  of  the  problems  you  can  encounter with Frozen-Bubble don't require contacting us directly, and
       actually we can't fix most of them.

       First, please notice that we have developed this software on the GNU/Linux platform. There are  ports  to
       other  operating  systems, but we can't and don't want to support them. If you happen to be using Frozen-
       Bubble on FreeBSD, NetBSD, Windows or Mac OS X, please contact the authors of this  "port"  if  you  have
       trouble installing/running/whatever. Thank you.

       Then,  if  you  use  Linux and installed a package provided by your distribution, you have to contact the
       guys of your distribution. We don't know the intrinsics of every  Linux  distributions  and  neither  the
       patches they have applied to Frozen-Bubble when packaging.

   <b>Troubleshoot</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>problems</b> <b>on</b> <b>GNU/Linux</b>
       First,  please notice that we are not a GNU/Linux vendor, we are not Debian, Red Hat, Ubuntu, Mandriva or
       Gentoo. So if you can't install it with apt-get, emerge, urpmi, yum or whatever, or  if  you  managed  to
       install it but it won't start or won't run properly, there are much higher chances this is a problem with
       your vendor, not with us. Try to think before contacting us: is your problem really with our software? or
       with how your vendor compiled/integrated it with the system?

       Now, to ease your life, we provide links to common problems you may encounter.

       "...cannot handle TLS data..." message at startup
           It  seems  this is related with buggy or badly installed nvidia drivers. Debian has a bugreport and a
           fix (&lt;<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi</a>?bug=223096&gt;) for this one.

       "Can't locate SDL.pm in @INC..." message at startup
           Either you didn't install sdlperl, or you installed it at the wrong location.  Check where  the  file
           <u>SDL.pm</u>  was installed on your system and what is the @INC search path of perl, there are chances they
           don't match.

               perl -e 'print join("\n", @INC)

       crash with a "SIGILL" when trying to start a new game
           You're probably using buggy "SDL-1.2.6" on an Intel processor; please update to "SDL-1.2.7"  or  more
           recent.

       "Not a HASH reference at /usr/games/frozen-bubble line 310" message at startup
           It  seems that you're using an incompatible (too recent) version of perl-SDL on FB1. Either downgrade
           or apply this patch. &lt;<a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/perl-SDL.patch">http://www.frozen-bubble.org/perl-SDL.patch</a>&gt;

       If  you  have  more  to  add,  you  may  want   to   contact   us:   "contact2   ＠   frozen-bubble.org",

</pre><h4><b>FREQUENTLY</b> <b>ASKED</b> <b>QUESTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Help!</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>download</b> <b>Frozen-Bubble</b> <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>website!</b>
       Uh, the downloads page (&lt;<a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/downloads/">http://www.frozen-bubble.org/downloads/</a>&gt;) should be fairly understandable…

       If   you're   using   Windows,   or   Mac   OS   X,   read  the  <u>Ports</u>  section  of  the  downloads  page
       (&lt;<a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/downloads/">http://www.frozen-bubble.org/downloads/</a>#Ports&gt;)!  man, you can do it, I am sure  you  can,  don't  quit
       trying so fast!

   <b>Help!</b> <b>Frozen-Bubble</b> <b>doesn't</b> <b>work!</b>
       Easy, go to the troubleshooting page (&lt;<a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/troubleshooting/">http://www.frozen-bubble.org/troubleshooting/</a>&gt;).  And don't forget
       we <b>don't</b> <b>know</b> your system or distribution, help yourself or ask your vendor.

   <b>Hey,</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>porting</b> <b>Frozen-Bubble</b> <b>to</b> <b>&lt;my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>phone</b> <b>or</b> <b>whatever&gt;?</b>
       Simple!  Because we aren't interested in this. Ask the authors of other ports, maybe they will be. But no
       use emailing us about it.  Thanks.

   <b>I'd</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>adding</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>aiming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b>
       Yes, but, see, it would not be fair to players using keyboard,  because  mouse  aiming  is  analog-based,
       whereas keys are not. So, no mouse, sorry.

   <b>My</b> <b>joystick</b> <b>doesn't</b> <b>work!</b>
       If you're not using Linux, sorry we don't know and support your system.

       If  you're  using Linux, maybe we can help. When trying to use your joystick in Frozen-Bubble, if nothing
       comes up,  most  probably  your  joystick  isn't  configured  correctly  (or  supported  in  Linux),  use
       "--joysticks-info"  commandline  parameter  to verify that FB detects your joystick properly: if it does,
       information about your joystick(s) will be printed in console on startup, and you should have no  problem
       using your joystick in FB - just trigger a direction or a button in the "change keys" dialog; if not, try
       to  load  the  proper  kernel  modules  etc  -  for example, the kernel module "joydev" is needed for all
       joysticks, but it is sometimes not automatically loaded when plugging  in  a  joystick  (even  in  modern
       distros and with USB joysticks) - after loading this kernel module, retry in FB.

   <b>Special</b> <b>keys</b>
       In the 3p/4p/5p network game, you can see F1, F2, F3 and F4 printed in the game screen - one function key
       per  remote  player. These keys allow you to aim at a particular remote player instead of everyone at the
       same time. Indeed, by default, when you create malus bubbles to be sent to your opponents (by exploding a
       larger group or when bubbles were sticked to exploding bubbles), they are distributed evenly among all of
       the (living) opponents. If you hit the, say, F2 key before (you can verify you did  because  F2  is  then
       printed  in  white on the game screen), next time you will create malus bubbles, they will all be sent to
       the top-right opponent. This feature can allow you to team up or to aim at the  strongest  opponent.  You
       can  hit  F10  to request back an evenly distribution. Notice that when using at least version 2.1.0, you
       can  see  who's  attacking  you  at  any  time  by  looking  at  at   pinguins   left   to   your   igloo
       (&lt;<a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/data/fb2.1-attackmaterialized.png">http://www.frozen-bubble.org/data/fb2.1-attackmaterialized.png</a>&gt;).

       The keys F11 and F12 are also useful (version 2.1.0 minimum): F11 allows one to toggle the music, and F12
       allows  one  to  toggle the sound (music plus sound effects).  Additionally, keypad's minus and plus keys
       allow to alter sound volume.

   <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame,</b> <b>I</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>toggle</b> <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game!</b>
       Easy, read the "Special keys" FAQ item.

   <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>2</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>computer,</b> <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>3/4/5</b> <b>player</b> <b>game</b> <b>in</b> <b>network?</b>
       Because in 3p/4p/5p game, there is room for only one player  with  full  size  graphics.  For  the  other
       players,  the  graphics  are  smaller (&lt;<a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/downloads/data/fb2-5p.png">http://www.frozen-bubble.org/downloads/data/fb2-5p.png</a>&gt;), so more
       than one local player is not possible.

   <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>chain</b> <b>reactions?</b>
       When you pop some bubbles, and another bubble was being held up by the bubbles  you  popped,  that  other
       bubble  falls and becomes a malus bubble.  In chain reaction mode, that other bubble can also rise up and
       pop some other bubbles, if you have a pair of bubbles on your screen that are the same color as it with a
       free position next to it.  This might, in turn, release more bubbles, which can  also  rise  up  and  pop
       pairs of their own color, in a big chain reaction. Let's illustrate that:

       1. First, you pop some bubbles of the same color, yellow in our example, which release some extra bubbles
       of a different color (black and purple).
           &lt;<a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/data/cr1-0.png">http://www.frozen-bubble.org/data/cr1-0.png</a>&gt;

       2. The purple bubble just falls.  The black bubble would fall too, but this is chain-reaction mode.  So
       instead of falling, the black bubble sees a group of other black bubble with a free position next to it,
       and swoops back up to be with them.
           &lt;<a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/data/cr1-1.png">http://www.frozen-bubble.org/data/cr1-1.png</a>&gt;

       3. The black bubbles pop, releasing several other bubbles.  The orange bubble sees a group of other
       orange bubbles with a free position next to it, and swoops back up to be with them.
           &lt;<a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/data/cr1-2.png">http://www.frozen-bubble.org/data/cr1-2.png</a>&gt;

       4. The orange bubbles pop, releasing a couple of other bubbles.
           &lt;<a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/data/cr1-3.png">http://www.frozen-bubble.org/data/cr1-3.png</a>&gt;

       5. But there are no more groups for these bubbles, so the chain reaction is over.

   <b>What's</b> <b>single</b> <b>player</b> <b>targetting?</b>
       Easy, read the "Special keys" FAQ item.

   <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>designers</b> <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>players</b> <b>on</b> <b>IRC?</b>
       Sure!  Please  join  the  IRC channel "#fb2-en" for English, or "#fb2-fr" for French, on irc.freenode.net
       (&lt;<a href="http://freenode.net/">http://freenode.net/</a>&gt;) - though we're rarely there. Best is to send a mail.
