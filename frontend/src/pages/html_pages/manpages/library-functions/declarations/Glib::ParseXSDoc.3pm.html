</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Glib::ParseXSDoc - Parse POD and XSub declarations from XS files.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the heart of an automatic API reference documentation system for XS-based Perl modules.  FIXME
       more info here!!

       FIXME document recognized POD directives and the output data structures

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       xsdocparse (@filenames)
           Parse  xs files for xsub signatures and pod.  Writes to standard output a data structure suitable for
           eval'ing in another Perl  script,  describing  all  the  stuff  found.   The  output  contains  three
           variables:

           $xspods = ARRAYREF
               array  of  pods found in the verbatim C portion of the XS file, listed in the order found.  These
               are assumed to pertain to the XS/C api, not the Perl api.  Any "=for apidoc" paragraphs following
               an "=object" paragraphs in the verbatim sections are stripped (as are the "=object"  paragraphs),
               and will appear instead in "$data-&gt;{$package}{pods}".

           $data = HASHREF
               big  hash  keyed  by package name (as found in the MODULE line), containing under each key a hash
               with all the xsubs and pods in that package, in  the  order  found.   Packages  are  consolidated
               across multiple files.

           FYI,  this  creates  a  new  parser  and calls "parse_file" on it for each input filename; then calls
           "swizzle_pods" to ensure that any "=for apidoc name" pods are matched up with their target xsubs; and
           finally calls Data::Dumper to write the data to stdout.  So, if you want to get  finer  control  over
           how the output is created, or keep all the data in-process, now you know how.  :-)

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $Glib::ParseXSDoc::verbose
           If true, this causes the parser to be verbose.

       $parser = Glib::ParseXSDoc-&gt;new
           Create a new xsub parser.

       string = $parser-&gt;package
           Get  the  current  package  name.  Falls back to the module name.  Will be undef if the parser hasn't
           reached the first MODULE line.

       HASHREF = $parser-&gt;pkgdata
           The data hash corresponding to the current package, honoring  the  most  recently  encountered  "=for
           object"  directive.   Ensures  that  it  exists.   Returns a reference to the member of the main data
           structure, so modifications are permanent and useful.

       $parser-&gt;parse_file (filename)
           Parse one xs file.  Stores all the collected data in <u>$parser</u>'s internal data structures.

       $parser-&gt;swizzle_pods
           Match "=for apidoc" pods to xsubs.

       $parser-&gt;preprocess_pods
           Honor the "__hide__" and "__function__" directives in "=for apidoc" lines.

           We look for the strings anywhere, but you'll typically have it at the end of the line, e.g.:

             =for apidoc symname __hide__        for detached blocks
             =for apidoc __hide__                for attached blocks

             =for apidoc symname __function__    for functions rather than methods
             =for apidoc __function__            for functions rather than methods

       bool = $parser-&gt;is_module_line ($line)
           Analyze <u>$line</u> to see if it contains an XS MODULE directive.  If so, returns true  after  setting  the
           <u>$parser</u>'s <u>module</u>, <u>package</u>, and <u>prefix</u> accordingly.

       $pod = $parser-&gt;slurp_pod_paragraph ($firstline, $term_regex=/^=cut\s*/)
           Slurp  up  POD  lines  from <u>$filehandle</u> from here to the next <u>$term_regex</u> or EOF.  Since you probably
           already read a line to determine that we needed to start a pod, you can pass that first  line  to  be
           included.

       $xsub = $parser-&gt;parse_xsub (\@lines)
       $xsub = $parser-&gt;parse_xsub (@lines)
           Parse  an  xsub  header,  in  the form of a list of lines, into a data structure describing the xsub.
           That includes pulling out the argument types, aliases, and code type.

           Without artificial intelligence, we cannot reliably determine anything about the types or  number  of
           parameters returned from xsubs with PPCODE bodies.

           OUTLIST  parameters  are  pulled  from  the  args  list  and  put  into an "outlist" key.  IN_OUTLIST
           parameters are put into both.

           Data type names are not mangled at all.

           Note that the method can take either a list of lines or a reference to a list  of  lines.   The  flat
           list  form  is  provided  for  compatibility; the reference form is preferred, to avoid duplicating a
           potentially large list of strings.

       $parser-&gt;clean_out_empty_pods
           Looks through the data member of the parser and removes any keys (and associated values) when no pod,
           enums, and xsubs exist for the package.
