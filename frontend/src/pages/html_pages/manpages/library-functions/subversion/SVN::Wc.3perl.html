</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SVN::Wc - Subversion working copy functions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Incomplete

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       SVN::Wc::parse_externals_description3($parent_directory, $desc, $canonicalize_url, $pool);
           Parse  the  string  $desc  as  an  "svn:externals"  value  and  return  a  reference  to  an array of
           _p_svn_wc_external_item2_t objects.  If $canonicalize_url is true, canonicalize the "url"  member  of
           those objects.  $parent_directory is only used in constructing error strings.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>svn_wc_status2_t</b>
       $wcstat-&gt;<b>entry()</b>
           A svn_wc_entry_t object for the item.  Can be undef if not under version control.

       $wcstat-&gt;<b>text_status()</b>
           An  integer  representing  the  status  of  the  item's  text.  Can be one of the $SVN::Wc::Status::*
           constants.

       $wcstat-&gt;<b>prop_status()</b>
           An integer representing the status of the item's properties.  Can be one of  the  $SVN::Wc::Status::*
           constants.

       $wcstat-&gt;<b>locked()</b>
           A  boolean  telling  if  the  item is locked.  A directory can be locked if a working copy update was
           interrupted.

       $wcstat-&gt;<b>copied()</b>
           A boolean telling if the item was copied.  A file or directory can be copied if  it's  scheduled  for
           addition-with-history (or part of a subtree that is scheduled as such).

       $wcstat-&gt;<b>switched()</b>
           A  boolean  telling  if  the  item  was  switched.  A file or directory can be switched if the switch
           command has been used.

       $wcstat-&gt;<b>repos_text_status()</b>
           An integer representing the status of the  item's  text  in  the  repository.   Can  be  one  of  the
           $SVN::Wc::Status::* constants.

       $wcstat-&gt;<b>repos_prop_status()</b>
           An  integer  representing  the  status of the item's properties in the repository.  Can be one of the
           $SVN::Wc::Status::* constants.

       $wcstat-&gt;<b>repos_lock()</b>
           A svn_lock_t object representing the entry's lock in the repository, if any.

       $wcstat-&gt;<b>url()</b>
           The url (actual or expected) of the item.

       $wcstat-&gt;<b>ood_last_cmt_rev()</b>
           An integer representing the youngest committed revision or $SVN::Core::INVALID_REVNUM is not  out  of
           date.

       $wcstat-&gt;<b>ood_last_cmt_date()</b>
           The date of the most recent commit as microseconds since 00:00:00 January 1, 1970 UTC or 0 if not out
           of date.

       $wcstat-&gt;<b>ood_kind()</b>
           An  integer representing the kind of the youngest commit.  Can be any of the $SVN::Node::* constants.
           Will be $SVN::Node::none if not out of date.

       $wcstat-&gt;<b>tree_conflict()</b>

       $wcstat-&gt;<b>file_external()</b>
           A boolean telling if the item is a file that was added to the working copy as an  svn:externals.   If
           file_external is TRUE, then switched is always FALSE.

       $wcstat-&gt;<b>pristine_text_status()</b>
           An  integer  representing the status of the item's text as compared to the pristine base of the file.
           Can be one of the $SVN::Wc::Status::* constants.

       $wcstat-&gt;<b>pristine_prop_status()</b>
           An integer representing the status of the item's properties as compared to the pristine base  of  the
           node.  Can be one of the $SVN::Wc::Status::* constants.

   <b>svn_wc_status_t</b>
       Same as svn_wc_status2_t, but without the repos_lock, url, ood_last_cmt_rev, ood_last_cmt_date, ood_kind,
       ood_last_cmt_author, tree_conflict, file_external, pristine_text_status, pristine_prop_status fields.
