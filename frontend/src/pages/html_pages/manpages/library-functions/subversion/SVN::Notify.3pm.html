</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       SVN::Notify - Subversion activity notification

</pre><h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4><pre>
       Use <u>svnnotify</u> in <u>post-commit</u>:

         svnnotify --repos-path "$1" --revision "$2" \
           --to <a href="mailto:developers@example.com">developers@example.com</a> [options]

         svnnotify --repos-path "$1" --revision "$2" \
           --to-cx-regex <a href="mailto:i10n@example.com">i10n@example.com</a>=I10N [options]

       Use the class in a custom script:

         use SVN::Notify;

         my $notifier = SVN::Notify-&gt;new(%params);
         $notifier-&gt;prepare;
         $notifier-&gt;execute;

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       This class may be used for sending email messages for Subversion repository activity. There are a number
       of different modes supported, and SVN::Notify is fully subclassable, to add new functionality, and offers
       comprehensive content filtering to easily modify the format of its messages. By default, A list of all
       the files affected by the commit will be assembled and listed in a single message. An additional option
       allows diffs to be calculated for the changes and either appended to the message or added as an
       attachment. See the "with_diff" and "attach_diff" options below.

</pre><h4><b>Usage</b></h4><pre>
       To use SVN::Notify, simply add a call to <u>svnnotify</u> to your Subversion repository's <u>post-commit</u> script.
       This script lives in the <u>hooks</u> directory at the root of the repository directory; consult the
       documentation in <u>post-commit.tmpl</u> for details. Make sure that you specify the complete path to <u>svnnotify</u>,
       as well as to <u>svnlook</u> and <u>sendmail</u> in the options passed to <u>svnnotify</u> so that everything executes
       properly. And if you specify any string options, be sure that they are in the encoding specified by the
       "--encoding" option, or UTF-8 if you have not specified "--encoding".

   <b>Windows</b> <b>Usage</b>
       To get SVN::Notify to work properly in a <u>post-commit</u> script, you must set the following environment
       variables, as they will likely not be present inside Apache:

       PATH=C:\perl\bin
       OS=Windows_NT
       SystemRoot=C:\WINDOWS

       See      Windows      Subversion      +      Apache     +     TortoiseSVN     +     SVN::Notify     HOWTO
       &lt;<a href="http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2006-05/0593.shtml">http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2006-05/0593.shtml</a>&gt;  for   more   detailed   information   on   getting
       SVN::Notify  running  on Windows. If you have issues with asynchronous execution, try using <u>HookStart.exe</u>
       &lt;<a href="http://www.koders.com/csharp/fidE2724F44EF2D47F1C0FE76C538006435FA20051D.aspx">http://www.koders.com/csharp/fidE2724F44EF2D47F1C0FE76C538006435FA20051D.aspx</a>&gt; to run <u>svnnotify</u>.

</pre><h4><b>Class</b> <b>Interface</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Constructor</b>
       <u>new</u>

         my $notifier = SVN::Notify-&gt;new(%params);

       Constructs and returns a new SVN::Notify object. This  object  is  a  handle  on  the  whole  process  of
       collecting  meta data and content for the commit email and then sending it. As such, it takes a number of
       parameters to affect that process.

       Each of these parameters has a corresponding command-line option that can be  passed  to  <u>svnnotify</u>.  The
       options have the same names as these parameters, but any underscores you see here should be replaced with
       dashes  when passed to <u>svnnotify</u>. Most also have a corresponding single-character option. On Perl 5.8 and
       higher, If you pass parameters to "new()", they <b>must</b> be decoded into Perl's internal form  if  they  have
       any non-ASCII characters.

       Supported parameters:

       repos_path
             svnnotify --repos-path "$PATH"
             svnnotify -p "$PATH"

           The  path  to  the  Subversion  repository.  The path is passed as the first argument when Subversion
           executes <u>post-commit</u>. So you can simply pass $1 to this parameter if you like. See the  documentation
           in <u>post-commit</u> for details. Required.

       revision
             svnnotify --revision "$REV"
             svnnotify -r "$REV"

           The revision number for the current commit. The revision number is passed as the second argument when
           Subversion  executes  <u>post-commit</u>.  So  you can simply pass $2 to this parameter if you like. See the
           documentation in <u>post-commit</u> for details. Required.

       to
             svnnotify --to <a href="mailto:commiters@example.com">commiters@example.com</a>
             svnnotify -t <a href="mailto:commiters@example.com">commiters@example.com</a> --to <a href="mailto:managers@example.com">managers@example.com</a>

           The address or addresses to which to send the notification email.  Can  be  used  multiple  times  to
           specify multiple addresses. This parameter is required unless either "to_regex_map" or "to_email_map"
           is specified.

       to_regex_map
             svnnotify --to-regex-map <a href="mailto:translate@example.com">translate@example.com</a>=L18N \
                       -x <a href="mailto:legal@example.com">legal@example.com</a>=License

           This  parameter  specifies  a  hash  reference  of  email  addresses  to  regular expression strings.
           SVN::Notify will compile the regular expression strings into regular  expression  objects,  and  then
           send  notification  messages if and only if the name of one or more of the paths affected by a commit
           matches the regular expression. This is a good way to have a notification email sent to a  particular
           mail  address  (or  comma-delimited list of addresses) only for certain parts of the subversion tree.
           This parameter is required unless "to" or "to_email_map" is specified.

           The command-line options, "--to-regex_map" and "-x", can be specified any number of times,  once  for
           each entry in the hash to be passed to "new()". The value passed to the option must be in the form of
           the  key  and  the  value separated by an equal sign. Consult the Getopt::Long documentation for more
           information.

           Here's an example complements of Matt Doar of how to use "to_regex_map" to do per-branch matching:

             author=`svnlook author $REPOS -r $REV`

             # The mail regexes should match all the top-level directories
             /usr/bin/svnnotify --repos-path "$REPOS" --revision "$REV" \
             -x <a href="mailto:eng-bar@example.com">eng-bar@example.com</a>,${EXTRAS}="^Bar" \
             -x <a href="mailto:eng-foo@example.com">eng-foo@example.com</a>,${EXTRAS}="^trunk/Foo|^branches/Foo|^tags/Foo" \
             -x $<a href="mailto:author@example.com">author@example.com</a>="^users" --subject-cx

       to_email_map
             svnnotify --to-email-map L18N=<a href="mailto:translate@example.com">translate@example.com</a> \
                       --to-email-map License=<a href="mailto:legal@example.com">legal@example.com</a>

           The inverse of "to_regex_map": The regular expression is the  hash  key  and  the  email  address  or
           addresses are the value.

       from
             svnnotify --from <a href="mailto:somewhere@example.com">somewhere@example.com</a>
             svnnotify -f <a href="mailto:elsewhere@example.com">elsewhere@example.com</a>

           The  email address to use in the "From" line of the email. If not specified, SVN::Notify will use the
           username from the commit, as returned by "svnlook info".

       user_domain
             svnnotify --user-domain example.com
             svnnotify -D example.net

           A domain name to append to the username for the "From" header of  the  email.   During  a  Subversion
           commit,  the  username  returned  by  "svnlook  info"  is  usually  something like a Unix login name.
           SVN::Notify will use this username in  the  email  "From"  header  unless  the  "from"  parameter  is
           specified.  If  you wish to have the username take the form of a real email address, specify a domain
           name and SVN::Notify will append "\@$domain_name" to the username in order to  create  a  real  email
           address. This can be useful if all of your committers have an email address that corresponds to their
           username at the domain specified by the "user_domain" parameter.

       svnlook
             svnnotify --svnlook /path/to/svnlook
             svnnotify -l /path/to/svnlook

           The  location  of  the  <u>svnlook</u>  executable.  If  not  specified, SVN::Notify will search through the
           directories in the $PATH environment variable, plus in <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a></u>, for  an  <u>svnlook</u>
           executable.  Specify  a  full  path to <u>svnlook</u> via this option or by setting the $SVNLOOK environment
           variable if <u>svnlook</u> isn't in your path or to avoid loading File::Spec.

           It's important to provide a complete path to <u>svnlook</u> because the environment during the execution  of
           <u>post-commit</u>  is  anemic,  with nary a $PATH environment variable to be found. So if <u>svnnotify</u> appears
           not to be working at all (and Subversion seems loathe to log when it dies!), make sure that you  have
           specified the complete path to a working <u>svnlook</u> executable.

       sendmail
             svnnotify --sendmail /path/to/sendmail
             svnnotify -s /path/to/sendmail

           The  location  of  the  <u>sendmail</u>  executable.  If  neither the "sendmail" nor the "smtp" parameter is
           specified, SVN::Notify will search through the directories in the $PATH environment variable, plus in
           <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a></u>, for an <u>sendmail</u> executable. Specify a full path to  <u>sendmail</u>  via  this
           option  or  by  setting the $SENDMAIL environment variable if <u>sendmail</u> isn't in your path or to avoid
           loading File::Spec. The same caveats as applied to the location of the <u>svnlook</u> executable apply here.

       set_sender
             svnnotify --set-sender
             svnnotify -E

           Uses the "-f" option to "sendmail" to set the envelope sender  address  of  the  email  to  the  same
           address  as is used for the "From" header. If you're also using the "from" option, be sure to make it
           <b>only</b> an email address. Don't include any other junk in it, like a sender's name. Ignored  when  using
           "smtp".

       smtp
             svnnotify --smtp smtp.example.com

           The  address  for  an  SMTP  server  through  which  to send the notification email.  If unspecified,
           SVN::Notify will use <u>sendmail</u> to send the message. If <u>sendmail</u> is not installed locally (such  as  on
           Windows boxes!), you <u>must</u> specify an SMTP server.

       smtp_tls
             svnnotify --smtp-tls

           Use  TLS  authentication and encrypted channels for connecting with the server.  Usually, TLS servers
           will require user/password authentication.

       smtp_user
             svnnotify --smtp-user myuser

           The  user  name  for  SMTP  authentication.  If  this  option  is  specified,  SVN::Notify  will  use
           Net::SMTP_auth to send the notification message, and will of course authenticate to the SMTP server.

       smtp_pass
             svnnotify --smtp-pass mypassword

           The password for SMTP authentication. Use in parallel with "smtp_user".

       smtp_port
             svnnotify --smtp-port 465

           The port for an SMTP server through which to send the notification email. The default port is 25.

       smtp_authtype
             svnnotify --smtp-authtype authtype

           Deprecated  in  SVN::Notify  2.83,  where  it  has become a no-op. The auth type is determined by the
           contents returned by the SMTP server's response to the "EHLO" command. See "TLS  and  AUTHentication"
           in Net::SMTP::TLS for details.

       encoding
             svnnotify --encoding UTF-8
             svnnotify -c Big5

           The  character  set typically used on the repository for log messages, file names, and file contents.
           Used to specify the character set  in  the  email  Content-Type  headers  and,  when  the  "language"
           parameter  is  specified,  the  $LANG  environment variable when launching "sendmail". See "Character
           Encoding Support" for more information. Defaults to "UTF-8".

       charset
             svnnotify --charset UTF-8

           Deprecated. Use "encoding" instead.

       svn_encoding
             svnnotify --svn-encoding euc-jp

           The character set used in files and log messages managed in  Subversion.  It's  useful  to  set  this
           option  if  you  store  files  in  Subversion  using  one character set but want to send notification
           messages in a different character set.  Therefore "encoding"  would  be  used  for  the  notification
           message,  and  "svn_encoding"  would be used to read in data from Subversion. See "Character Encoding
           Support" for more information. Defaults to the value stored in "encoding".

       diff_encoding
             svnnotify --diff-encoding iso-2022-jp

           The character set used by files in Subversion, and thus present in the the diff. It's useful  to  set
           this  option  if  you store files in Subversion using one character write log messages in a different
           character set. Therefore "svn_encoding" would be used to read the  log  message  and  "diff_encoding"
           would  be  used  to  read  the  diff  from  Subversion.  See  "Character  Encoding  Support" for more
           information. Defaults to the value stored in "svn_encoding".

       language
             svnnotify --language fr
             svnnotify -g i-klingon

           The language typically used on the repository for log messages, file names, and file  contents.  Used
           to  specify  the  email  Content-Language  header  and  to  set  the  $LANG  environment  variable to
           "$notify-&gt;language . '.' .  $notify-&gt;encoding" before executing "svnlook" and "sendmail" (but not for
           sending data to Net::SMTP). Undefined by default, meaning that no Content-Language header  is  output
           and  the  $LANG  environment  variable  will  not  be  set. See "Character Encoding Support" for more
           information.

       with_diff
             svnnotify --with-diff
             svnnotify -d

           A boolean value specifying whether or not to include the output of "svnlook diff" in the notification
           email. The diff will be inline at the end of the email unless the "attach_diff" parameter specifies a
           true value.

       attach_diff
             svnnotify --attach-diff
             svnnotify -a

           A boolean value specifying whether or not to attach the output of "svnlook diff" to the  notification
           email. Rather than being inline in the body of the email, this parameter causes SVN::Notify to attach
           the diff as a separate file, named for the user who triggered the commit and the date and time UTC at
           which  the  commit  took  place.  Specifying  this  parameter  to  a  true  value implicitly sets the
           "with_diff" parameter to a true value.

       diff_switches
             svnnotify --diff-switches '--no-diff-added'
             svnnotify -w '--no-diff-deleted'

           Switches to pass to "svnlook diff", such as "--no-diff-deleted" and "--no-diff-added". And who knows,
           maybe  someday  it  will  support  the  same  options  as  "svn  diff",  such  as  "--diff-cmd"   and
           "--extensions". Only relevant when used with "with_diff" or "attach_diff".

       diff_content_type
             svnnotify --diff-content-type 'text/x-diff'

           Sets  the  Content-Type  header for attached diffs.  The default, if this parameter is not passed, is
           'text/plain'.  This parameter has no effect if '--attach-diff' is not specified.

       reply_to
             svnnotify --reply-to <a href="mailto:devlist@example.com">devlist@example.com</a>
             svnnotify -R <a href="mailto:developers@example.net">developers@example.net</a>

           The email address to use in the "Reply-To" header of the notification email.   No  "Reply-To"  header
           will be added to the email if no value is specified for the "reply_to" parameter.

       add_headers
             svnnotify --add-header X-Approve=letMeIn

           Add a header to the notification email message. The header name and its value must be separated by an
           equals  sign.  Specify  the  option multiple times in order to add multiple headers. Headers with the
           same names are allowed. Not to be confused with the "--header" option, which adds  introductory  text
           to the beginning of the email body.

       subject_prefix
             svnnotify --subject-prefix [Devlist]
             svnnotify -P [%d (Our-Developers)]

           An  optional  string to prepend to the beginning of the subject line of the notification email. If it
           contains '%d', it will be used to place the revision number; otherwise it will simply be prepended to
           the subject, which will contain the revision number in brackets.

       subject_cx
             svnnotify --subject-cx
             svnnotify -C

           A boolean value indicating whether or not to include a the context of the commit in the subject  line
           of  the  email. In a commit that affects multiple files, the context will be the name of the shortest
           directory affected by the commit. This should indicate up to how high up  the  Subversion  repository
           tree  the  commit had an effect. If the commit affects a single file, then the context will simply be
           the name of that file.

       strip_cx_regex
             svnnotify --strip-cx-regex '^trunk/'
             svnnotify --strip-cx-regex '^trunk/' --strip-cx-regex '^branches/'
             svnnotify -X '^trunk'
             svnnotify -X '^trunk' -X '^branches'

           One or more regular expressions to be used to strip out parts of the subject  context.  This  can  be
           useful  for  very  deep Subversion trees, where the commits you're sending will always be sent from a
           particular subtree, so you'd like to remove part of the tree. Used only if "subject_cx" is set  to  a
           true value.  Pass an array reference if calling "new()" directly.

       no_first_line
             svnnotify --no-first-line
             svnnotify -O

           Omits  the  first  line  of  the  log  message  from  the  subject.  This is most useful when used in
           combination with the "subject_cx" parameter, so that just the commit  context  is  displayed  in  the
           subject and no part of the log message.

       header
             svnnotify --header 'SVN::Notify is brought to you by Kineticode.

           Adds a specified text to each message as a header at the beginning of the body of the message. Not to
           be confused with the "--add-header" option, which adds a header to the headers section of the email.

       footer
             svnnotify --footer 'Copyright (R) by Kineticode, Inc.'

           Adds a specified text to each message as a footer at the end of the body of the message.

       max_sub_length
             svnnotify --max-sub-length 72
             svnnotify -i 76

           The maximum length of the notification email subject line. SVN::Notify includes the first line of the
           commit log message, or the first sentence of the message (defined as any text up to the string ". "),
           whichever  is shorter. This could potentially be quite long. To prevent the subject from being over a
           certain number of characters, specify a maximum  length  here,  and  SVN::Notify  will  truncate  the
           subject to the last word under that length.

       max_diff_length
             svnnotify --max-diff-length 1024

           The  maximum  length  of the diff (attached or in the body). The diff output is truncated at the last
           line under the maximum character count specified and then outputs an additional line indicating  that
           the  maximum  diff  size  was  reached and output truncated. This is helpful when a large diff output
           could cause a message to bounce due to message size.

       handler
             svnnotify --handler HTML
             svnnotify -H HTML

           Specify the subclass of SVN::Notify to be constructed and  returned,  and  therefore  to  handle  the
           notification.  Of course you can just use a subclass directly, but this parameter is designed to make
           it easy to just use  "SVN::Notify-&gt;new"  without  worrying  about  loading  subclasses,  such  as  in
           <u>svnnotify</u>.  Be sure to read the documentation for your subclass of choice, as there may be additional
           parameters and existing parameters may behave differently.

       filters
             svnnotify --filter Trac -F My::Filter

             SVN::Notify-&gt;new( %params, filters =&gt; ['Markdown', 'My::Filter'] );

           Specify a more module to be loaded in the expectation that it defines output  filters.  For  example,
           SVN::Notify::Filter::Trac  loads  a  filter  that  converts log messages from Trac's markup format to
           HTML.  SVN::Notify::Filter::Markdown, available on CPAN, does the same  for  Markdown  format.  Check
           CPAN for other SVN::Notify filter modules.

           This  command-line  option  can  be  specified more than once to load multiple filters. The "filters"
           parameter to "new()" should be an array reference of modules names. If a value contains "::",  it  is
           assumed  to be a complete module name. Otherwise, it is assumed to be in the SVN::Notify::Filter name
           space.  See SVN::Notify::Filter for details on writing your own output filters (it's really  easy,  I
           promise!).

       author_url
             svnnotify --author-url '<a href="http://svn.example.com/changelog/~author">http://svn.example.com/changelog/~author</a>=%s/repos'
             svnnotify --A 'mailto:%<a href="mailto:s@example.com">s@example.com</a>'

           If  a  URL  is  specified  for  this parameter, then it will be used to create a link for the current
           author. The URL can have the "%s" format where the author's username should be put into the URL.

       revision_url
             svnnotify --revision-url '<a href="http://svn.example.com/changelog/">http://svn.example.com/changelog/</a>?cs=%s'
             svnnotify -U '<a href="http://svn.example.com/changelog/">http://svn.example.com/changelog/</a>?cs=%s'

           If a URL is specified for this parameter, then it will be used to create a  link  to  the  Subversion
           browser URL corresponding to the current revision number. It will also be used to create links to any
           other  revision  numbers mentioned in the commit message. The URL must have the "%s" format where the
           Subversion revision number should be put into the URL.

       svnweb_url
             svnnotify --svnweb-url '<a href="http://svn.example.com/index.cgi/revision/">http://svn.example.com/index.cgi/revision/</a>?rev=%s'
             svnnotify -S '<a href="http://svn.example.net/index.cgi/revision/">http://svn.example.net/index.cgi/revision/</a>?rev=%s'

           Deprecated. Use "revision_url" instead.

       viewcvs_url
             svnnotify --viewcvs-url '<a href="http://svn.example.com/viewcvs/">http://svn.example.com/viewcvs/</a>?rev=%s&amp;view=rev'

           Deprecated. Use "revision_url" instead.

       ticket_map
             svnnotify --ticket-map '\[?#\s*(\d+)\s*\]?=<a href="http://example.com/ticket">http://example.com/ticket</a>?id=%s' \
                       --ticket-map 'rt=<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html">http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html</a>?id=%s' \
                       --ticket-map '\b([A-Z0-9]+-\d+)\b=<a href="http://jira/browse/">http://jira/browse/</a>%s'

           Specifies a mapping between a regular expression and a URL. The regular expression  should  return  a
           single  match to be interpolated into the URL, which should be a "sprintf" format using "%s" to place
           the match (usually the ticket identifier) from the regex. The command-line option  may  be  specified
           any  number  of  times  for  different  ticketing  systems.  To  the API, it must be passed as a hash
           reference.

           The first example matches "[#1234]" or "#1234" or "[# 1234]". This regex should  be  as  specific  as
           possible,  preferably wrapped in "\b" to match word boundaries. If you're using SVN::Notify::HTML, be
           sure to read its documentation for a different regular expression requirement!

           Optionally, the key value  can  be  a  placeholder  for  a  regular  expression  used  internally  by
           SVN::Notify to match strings typically used for well-known ticketing systems. Those keys are:

           rt  Matches  Request Tracker (RT) ticket references of the form "Ticket # 12", "ticket 6", "RT # 52",
               "rt 52", "RT-Ticket # 213" or even "Ticket#1066".

           bugzilla
               Matches Bugzilla bug references of the form "Bug # 12" or "bug 6" or even "Bug#1066".

           jira
               Matches JIRA references of the form "JRA-1234".

           gnats
               Matches GnatsWeb references of the form "PR 1234".

       rt_url
             svnnotify --rt-url '<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html">http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html</a>?id=%s'
             svnnotify -T '<a href="http://rt.perl.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html">http://rt.perl.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html</a>?id=%s'

           A shortcut for "--ticket-map 'rt=$url'" provided for backwards compatibility.

       bugzilla_url
             svnnotify --bugzilla-url '<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi">http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi</a>?id=%s'
             svnnotify -B '<a href="http://bugs.bricolage.cc/show_bug.cgi">http://bugs.bricolage.cc/show_bug.cgi</a>?id=%s'

           A shortcut for "--ticket-map 'bugzilla=$url'" provided for backwards compatibility.

       jira_url
             svnnotify --jira-url '<a href="http://jira.atlassian.com/secure/ViewIssue.jspa">http://jira.atlassian.com/secure/ViewIssue.jspa</a>?key=%s'
             svnnotify -J '<a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewIssue.jspa">http://nagoya.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewIssue.jspa</a>?key=%s'

           A shortcut for "--ticket-map 'jira=$url'" provided for backwards compatibility.

       gnats_url
             svnnotify --gnats-url '<a href="http://gnatsweb.example.com/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl">http://gnatsweb.example.com/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl</a>?cmd=view&amp;pr=%s'
             svnnotify -G '<a href="http://gnatsweb.example.com/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl">http://gnatsweb.example.com/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl</a>?cmd=view&amp;pr=%s'

           A shortcut for "--ticket-map 'gnats=$url'" provided for backwards compatibility.

       ticket_url
             svnnotify --ticket-url '<a href="http://ticket.example.com/showticket.html">http://ticket.example.com/showticket.html</a>?id=%s'

           Deprecated. Use "ticket_map", instead.

       ticket_regex
             svnnotify --ticket-regex '\[?#\s*(\d+)\s*\]?'

           Deprecated. Use "ticket_map", instead.

       verbose
             svnnotify --verbose -V

           A value between 0 and 3 specifying how verbose SVN::Notify should be. The default is 0, meaning  that
           SVN::Notify  will  be  silent.  A value of 1 causes SVN::Notify to output some information about what
           it's doing, while 2 and 3 each cause greater verbosity. To set the verbosity  on  the  command  line,
           simply  pass  the  "--verbose"  or  "-V"  option once for each level of verbosity, up to three times.
           Output from SVN::Notify is sent to "STDOUT".

       boundary
           The boundary to use  between  email  body  text  and  attachments.  This  is  normally  generated  by
           SVN::Notify.

       subject
           The subject of the email to be sent. This attribute is normally generated by "prepare_subject()".

   <b>Class</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <u>content_type</u>

         my $content_type = SVN::Notify-&gt;content_type;

       Returns  the  content type of the notification message, "text/plain". Used to set the Content-Type header
       for the message.

       <u>register_attributes</u>

         SVN::Notify::Subclass-&gt;register_attributes(
             foo_attr =&gt; 'foo-attr=s',
             bar      =&gt; 'bar',
             bat      =&gt; undef,
         );

       This class method is used by subclasses to register new attributes. Pass in a list  of  key/value  pairs,
       where the keys are the attribute names and the values are option specifications in the format required by
       Getopt::Long.  SVN::Notify  will  create  accessors for each attribute, and if the corresponding value is
       defined, it will be used by the "get_options()" class method to get a command-line option value.

       See &lt;LSVN::Notify::HTML|SVN::Notify::HTML&gt; for an example usage of "register_attributes()".

       <u>get_options</u>

         my $options = SVN::Notify-&gt;get_options;

       Parses the command-line options in @ARGV to a hash reference suitable for passing as  the  parameters  to
       "new()".  See  "new" for a complete list of the supported parameters and their corresponding command-line
       options.

       This method use Getopt::Long to parse @ARGV. It then looks for any "handler" and "filter" options and, if
       it finds any, loads the appropriate classes and parses any options they requires from  @ARGV.  Subclasses
       and  filter  classes  should  use  "register_attributes()"  to  register  any attributes and options they
       require.

       After that, on Perl 5.8 and later, it decodes all of the string option from the encoding specified by the
       "encoding" option or UTF-8. This allows options to be passed to SVN::Notify in that encoding and  end  up
       being displayed properly in the resulting notification message.

       <u>file_label_map</u>

         my $map = SVN::Notify-&gt;file_label_map;

       Returns  a hash reference of the labels to be used for the lists of files. A hash reference of file lists
       is stored in the "files" attribute after "prepare_files()" has been called. The hash keys  in  that  list
       correspond  to  Subversion  status  codes,  and  these are mapped to their appropriate labels by the hash
       reference returned by this method:

         { U =&gt; 'Modified Paths',
           A =&gt; 'Added Paths',
           D =&gt; 'Removed Paths',
           _ =&gt; 'Property Changed'
         }

       <u>find_exe</u>

         my $exe = SVN::Notify-&gt;find_exe($exe_name);

       This method searches through the system path,  as  well  as  the  extra  directories  <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u>  and
       <u><a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a></u> (because they're common paths for "svnlook" and "sendmail" for an executable file with the name
       $exe_name.  The first one it finds is returned with its full path. If none is found, "find_exe()" returns
       undef.

</pre><h4><b>Instance</b> <b>Interface</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Instance</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <u>prepare</u>

         $notifier-&gt;prepare;

       Prepares  the  SVN::Notify  object,  collecting  all  the  data  it  needs in preparation for sending the
       notification email. Really it's just a shortcut for:

         $notifier-&gt;prepare_recipients;
         $notifier-&gt;prepare_contents;
         $notifier-&gt;prepare_files;
         $notifier-&gt;prepare_subject;

       Only it returns after the call to "prepare_recipients()" if there are no recipients  (that  is,  as  when
       recipients are specified solely by the "to_regex_map" or "to_email_map" parameter and none of the regular
       expressions match any of the affected directories).

       <u>prepare_recipients</u>

         $notifier-&gt;prepare_recipients;

       Collects  and  prepares  a  list  of the notification recipients. The recipients are a combination of the
       value passed to the "to" parameter as well as any email addresses specified as keys in the hash reference
       passed "to_regex_map" parameter or values passed to the "to_email_map" parameter, where the corresponding
       regular expressions stored in the hash matches one or more of the names of the  directories  affected  by
       the commit.

       If  the  <u>subject_cx</u>  parameter  to  "new()"  has a true value, "prepare_recipients()" also determines the
       directory name to use for the context.

       <u>prepare_contents</u>

         $notifier-&gt;prepare_contents;

       Prepares the contents of the commit message, including the name of the user who triggered the commit (and
       therefore the contents of the "From" header to be used in the email) and the log message.

       <u>prepare_files</u>

         $notifier-&gt;prepare_files;

       Prepares the lists of files affected by the commit, sorting them into their categories:  modified  files,
       added  files, and deleted files. It also compiles a list of files wherein a property was set, which might
       have some overlap with the list of modified files (if a single commit both modified  a  file  and  set  a
       property on it).

       If  the  "subject_cx"  parameter  was  specified  and  a  single  file  was  affected by the commit, then
       "prepare_files()" will also specify that file name as the context to be used in the subject line  of  the
       commit email.

       <u>prepare_subject</u>

         $notifier-&gt;prepare_subject;

       Prepares   the   subject   line   for   the   notification  email.  This  method  <b>must</b>  be  called  after
       "prepare_recipients()" and "prepare_files()", since each of those methods potentially sets up the context
       for use in the the subject line. The subject may have a prefix defined by the "subject_prefix"  parameter
       to  "new()",  it  has the revision number, it might have the context if the "subject_cx" specified a true
       value, and it will have the first sentence or line of the commit, whichever is shorter. The  subject  may
       then be truncated to the maximum length specified by the "max_sub_length" parameter.

       <u>execute</u>

         $notifier-&gt;execute;

       Sends  the  notification  message.  This involves opening a file handle to <u>sendmail</u> or a tied file handle
       connected to an SMTP server and passing  it  to  "output()".  This  is  the  main  method  used  to  send
       notifications or execute any other actions in response to Subversion activity.

       <u>output</u>

         $notifier-&gt;output($file_handle);
         $notifier-&gt;output($file_handle, $no_headers);

       Called  internally  by  "execute()"  to  output a complete email message. The file a file handle, so that
       "output()" and its related methods can print directly to the email message. The optional second argument,
       if true, will suppress the output of the email headers.

       Really "output()" is a simple wrapper around a number of other method calls.  It is  thus  essentially  a
       shortcut for:

           $notifier-&gt;output_headers($out) unless $no_headers;
           $notifier-&gt;output_content_type($out);
           $notifier-&gt;start_body($out);
           $notifier-&gt;output_metadata($out);
           $notifier-&gt;output_log_message($out);
           $notifier-&gt;output_file_lists($out);
           if ($notifier-&gt;with_diff) {
               my $diff_handle = $self-&gt;diff_handle;
               if ($notifier-&gt;attach_diff) {
                   $notifier-&gt;end_body($out);
                   $notifier-&gt;output_attached_diff($out, $diff_handle);
               } else {
                   $notifier-&gt;output_diff($out, $diff_handle);
                   $notifier-&gt;end_body($out);
               }
           } else {
               $notifier-&gt;end_body($out);
           }
           $notifier-&gt;end_message($out);

       <u>output_headers</u>

         $notifier-&gt;output_headers($file_handle);

       Outputs  the  headers for the notification message headers. Should be called only once for a single email
       message.

       <u>output_content_type</u>

         $notifier-&gt;output_content_type($file_handle);

       Outputs the content type and transfer encoding headers. These demarcate the body of the message.  If  the
       "attach_diff"  parameter  was  set to true, then a boundary string will be generated and the Content-Type
       set to "multipart/mixed" and stored as the "boundary" attribute.

       After that, this method outputs  the  content  type  returned  by  "content_type()",  the  character  set
       specified  by  the "encoding" attribute, and a Content-Transfer-Encoding of "8bit". Subclasses can either
       rely on this functionality or override this method to provide their own content type headers.

       <u>start_body</u>

         $notifier-&gt;start_body($file_handle);

       This method starts the body of the notification message, which means that it outputs the contents of  the
       "header"  attribute,  if  there  are  any.  Otherwise  it  outputs  nothing, but see subclasses for other
       behaviors.

       <u>output_metadata</u>

         $notifier-&gt;output_metadata($file_handle);

       This method outputs the metadata of the commit, including the revision number, author (user), and date of
       the revision. If the "author_url" or "revision_url" attributes have been set, then the appropriate URL(s)
       for the revision will also be output.

       <u>output_log_message</u>

         $notifier-&gt;output_log_message($file_handle);

       Outputs the commit log message, as well as the label "Log Message".

       <u>output_file_lists</u>

         $notifier-&gt;output_file_lists($file_handle);

       Outputs the lists of modified, added, and deleted  files,  as  well  as  the  list  of  files  for  which
       properties  were  changed. The labels used for each group are pulled in from the "file_label_map()" class
       method.

       <u>end_body</u>

         $notifier-&gt;end_body($file_handle);

       Closes out the body of the email by outputting the contents of the "footer" attribute, if any, and then a
       couple of newlines. Designed to be called when the body of the message is complete, and before  any  call
       to "output_attached_diff()".

       <u>output_diff</u>

         $notifier-&gt;output_diff($out_file_handle, $diff_file_handle);

       Reads diff data from $diff_file_handle and outputs it to to $out_file_handle.

       <u>output_attached_diff</u>

         $notifier-&gt;output_attached_diff($out_file_handle, $diff_file_handle);

       Reads diff data from $diff_file_handle and outputs it to to $out_file_handle as an attachment.

       <u>end_message</u>

         $notifier-&gt;end_message($file_handle);

       Outputs  the  final  part  of the message,. In this case, that means only a boundary if the "attach_diff"
       parameter is true. Designed to be called after any call to "output_attached_diff()".

       <u>run_ticket_map</u>

         $notifier-&gt;run_ticket_map( \&amp;callback, @params );

       Loops over the ticket systems you have defined, calling the $callback function for each one,  passing  to
       it the regex, url and @params specified as its parameters.

       <u>run_filters</u>

         $data = $notifier-&gt;run_filters( $output_type =&gt; $data );

       Runs the filters for $output_type on $data. Used internally by SVN::Notify and by subclasses.

       <u>filters_for</u>

         my $filters = $notifier-&gt;filters_for( $output_type );

       Returns  an  array  reference of of the filters loaded for $output_type.  Returns "undef" if there are no
       filters have been loaded for $output_type.

       <u>diff_handle</u>

         my $diff = $notifier-&gt;diff_handle;
         while (&lt;$diff&gt;) { print }

       Returns a file handle reference providing access to the the commit diff. It will usually be passed as the
       second argument to "output_diff()" or "output_attached_diff()".

   <b>Accessors</b>
       <u>repos_path</u>

         my $repos_path = $notifier-&gt;repos_path;
         $notifier = $notifier-&gt;repos_path($repos_path);

       Gets or sets the value of the "repos_path" attribute.

       <u>revision</u>

         my $revision = $notifier-&gt;revision;
         $notifier = $notifier-&gt;revision($revision);

       Gets or sets the value of the "revision" attribute.

       <u>to</u>

         my $to = $notifier-&gt;to;
         $notifier = $notifier-&gt;to($to);
         my @tos = $notifier-&gt;to;
         $notifier = $notifier-&gt;to(@tos);

       Gets or sets the list of values stored in the "to" attribute. In a scalar context, it  returns  only  the
       first value in the list, for backwards compatibility with older versions of SVN::Notify. In list context,
       it  of  course  returns the entire list. Pass in one or more values to set all of the values for the "to"
       attribute.

         $notifier = $notifier-&gt;env_lang($env_lang);

       Gets  or  sets  the  value  of  the  "env_lang"  attribute,  which  is  set to "$notify-&gt;language . '.' .
       $notify-&gt;encoding" when "language" is set, and otherwise is "undef". This attribute is used  to  set  the

             'X-Reject' =&gt; 'Me!',
         });

       Gets  or  sets  the  value of the "add_headers" attribute, which is a hash reference of the headers to be
       added to the email message. If one header needs to appear multiple times, simply pass  the  corresponding
       hash  value  as  an  array  reference  of each value for the header. Not to be confused with the "header"
       accessor, which gets and sets text to be included at the beginning of the body of the email message.

         my @strip_cx_regexs = $notifier-&gt;strip_cx_regex;
         $notifier = $notifier-&gt;strip_cx_regex(@strip_cx_regexs);

       Gets or sets the list of values stored in the "strip_cx_regex" attribute. In a scalar context, it returns
       only the first value in the list; in list context, it of course returns the entire list. Pass in  one  or
       more values to set all of the values for the "strip_cx_regex" attribute.

   <b>Character</b> <b>Encoding</b> <b>Support</b>
       SVN::Notify  has  comprehensive  support  for  character  encodings, but since it cannot always know what
       encodings your system supports or in which your data is stored in Subversion,  it  needs  your  help.  In
       plain  English,  here's  what  you  need to know to make non-ASCII characters look right in SVN::Notify's
       messages:

       •   The encoding for messages

           To tell SVN::Notify what character encoding to use when  it  sends  messages,  use  the  "--encoding"
           option.  It  defaults  to  "UTF-8", which should cover the vast majority of needs. You're using it in
           your code already, right?

       •   The character set you use in your log messages

           To tell SVN::Notify the character encoding that you use in Subversion commit log messages, as well as
           the names of the files in Subversion, use the "--svn-encoding" option, which  defaults  to  the  same
           value as "--encoding".  If, for example, you write log messages in Big5, pass "--svn-encoding Big5".

       •   The character set you use in your code

           To  tell  SVN::Notify  the  character  encoding  that  you use in the files stored in Subversion, and
           therefore that will be output in diffs, use the "--diff-encoding" option, which defaults to the  same
           value  as  "--svn-encoding".  If,  for  example,  you  write code in euc-jp but write your commit log
           messages in some other encoding, pass "--diff-encoding euc-jp".

       •   The locales supported by your OS

           SVN::Notify uses the values passed to "--encoding", "--svn-encoding", and "--diff-encoding"  to  read
           in  data  from  <u>svnlook</u>, convert it to Perl's internal encoding, and to output messages in the proper
           encoding. Most of the time, if you write code in UTF-8 and want messages delivered in UTF-8, you  can
           ignore these options.

           Sometimes,  however, <u>svnlook</u> converts its output to some other encoding.  That encoding is controlled
           by the $LANG environment variable,  which  corresponds  to  a  locale  supported  by  your  OS.  (See
           perllocale  for  instructions  for  finding  the  locales  supported  by your system.) If your system
           supports UTF-8 locales but defaults to using  some  other  locale  (causing  <u>svnlook</u>  to  output  log
           messages  in  the  wrong  encoding),  then  all you have to do is pass the "--language" option to get
           SVN::Notify to tell <u>svnlook</u> to use it. For example, if all of your data is in UTF-8, pass "--language
           en_US" to get SVN::Notify to use the <u>en_US.UTF-8</u> locale. Likewise, pass "--language sv_SE"  to  force
           the use of the <u>sv_SE.UTF-8</u> locale.

           Sometimes,  however,  the  system  does not support UTF-8 locales. Or perhaps you use something other
           than UTF-8 in your log messages or source code. This should be no problem, as  SVN::Notify  uses  the
           encoding  options  to determine the locales to use. For example, if your OS offers the <u>en_US.ISO88591</u>
           locale, pass both "--svn-encoding" and "--language", like so:

             --svn-encoding ISO-8859-1 --language en_US

           SVN::Notify will set the $LANG environment variable to "en_US.ISO88591", which <u>svnlook</u>  will  use  to
           convert  log  messages from its internal form to ISO-8859-1. SVN::Notify will convert the output from
           <u>svnlook</u> to UTF-8 (or whatever "--encoding" you've specified) before sending the message.  Of  course,
           if you have characters that don't correspond to ISO-8859-1, you'll still get some garbage characters.
           It  is  ideal  when  the OS locale supports the same encodings as you use in your source code and log
           messages, though that's not always the case.

           And finally, because the names and spellings that  OS  vendors  use  for  locales  can  vary  widely,
           SVN::Notify  will  occasionally get the name of the encoding wrong, in which case you'll see warnings
           such as this:

             svnlook: warning: cannot set LC_CTYPE locale
             svnlook: warning: environment variable LANG is en_US.ISO88591
             svnlook: warning: please check that your locale name is correct

           In such a case, if all of your data and your log messages are stored in the same  encoding,  you  can
           set the $LANG environment variable directly in your <u>post-commit</u> script before running <u>svnnotify</u>:

             LANG=en_US.ISO-88591 svnnotify -p "$1" -r "$2"

           If  the  $LANG  environment  variable  is already set in this way, SVN::Notify will not set it before
           shelling out to <u>svnlook</u>.

       This looks like a lot of information, and it is. But in most cases, if  you  exclusively  use  UTF-8  (or
       ASCII!)  in your source code and log messages, and your OS defaults to a UTF-8 locale, things should just
       work.
