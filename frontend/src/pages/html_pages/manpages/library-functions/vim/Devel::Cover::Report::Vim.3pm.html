</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Devel::Cover::Report::Vim - Backend for displaying coverage data in Vim

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.44

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        cover -report vim

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a reporting mechanism for displaying coverage data in Vim.  It is designed to be
       called from the "cover" program.

       By default, the output of this report is a file named "coverage.vim" in the directory of the coverage
       database.  To use it, run

        :so cover_db/coverage.vim

       and you should see signs in the left column indicating the coverage status of that line.

       The signs are as follows:

        P - Pod coverage
        S - Statement coverage
        R - Subroutine coverage
        B - Branch coverage
        C - Condition coverage

       The last of the criteria, in the order given above, is the one which is displayed.  Correctly covered
       criteria are shown in green.  Incorrectly covered criteria are shown in red.  Any incorrectly covered
       criterion will override a correctly covered criterion.

       If the coverage for the file being displayed is out of date the a function called <b>CoverageOld()</b> is called
       and passed the name of the file.  Similarly, for current coverage data file CoverageValid is called.

       Signs may be overridden in a file named devel-cover.vim located somewhere underneath the <a href="file:~/.vim">~/.vim</a>
       directory.

       For example, I use the solarized theme and keep the following commands in my local configuration file
       <a href="file:~/.vim/local/devel-cover.vim">~/.vim/local/devel-cover.vim</a>:

        let s:fg_cover = "#859900"
        let s:fg_error = "#dc322f"
        let s:bg_valid = "#073642"
        let s:bg_old   = "#342a2a"

        let s:types = [ "pod", "subroutine", "statement", "branch", "condition", ]

        for s:type in s:types
            exe "highlight cov_" . s:type .       " ctermbg=1 cterm=bold gui=NONE guifg=" . s:fg_cover
            exe "highlight cov_" . s:type . "_error ctermbg=1 cterm=bold gui=NONE guifg=" . s:fg_error
        endfor
        exe "highlight SignColumn ctermbg=0 guibg=" . s:bg_valid

        " highlight cov ctermbg=8 guibg=#002b36
        " highlight err ctermbg=0 guibg=#073642

        function! s:set_bg(bg)
            for s:type in s:types
                exe "highlight cov_" . s:type .       " guibg=" . a:bg
                exe "highlight cov_" . s:type . "_error guibg=" . a:bg
            endfor
            exe "highlight SignColumn ctermbg=0 guibg=" . a:bg
        endfunction

        function! CoverageValid(filename)
            call s:set_bg(s:bg_valid)
        endfunction

        function! CoverageOld(filename)
            call s:set_bg(s:bg_old)
        endfunction

       This configuration sets the background colour of the signs to a dark red when the coverage data is out of
       date.

       coverage.vim adds two user commands: :Cov and :Uncov which can be used to toggle the state of coverage
       signs.

       The idea and the vim template is shamelessly stolen from Simplecov-Vim.  See
