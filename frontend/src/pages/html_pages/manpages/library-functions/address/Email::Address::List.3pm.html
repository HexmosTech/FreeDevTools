           Foo Bar &lt;<a href="mailto:simple@example.com">simple@example.com</a>&gt;, (an obsolete comment),,,
            a group:

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Parser for From, To, Cc, Bcc, Reply-To, Sender and previous prefixed with Resent- (eg Resent-From)
       headers.

</pre><h4><b>REASONING</b></h4><pre>
       Email::Address is good at parsing addresses out of any text even mentioned headers and this module is
       derived work from Email::Address.

       However, mentioned headers are structured and contain lists of addresses. Most of the time you want to
       parse such field from start to end keeping everything even if it's an invalid input.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>parse</b>
       A class method that takes a header value (w/o name and :) and a set of named options, for example:

           my @list = Email::Address::List-&gt;parse( $line, option =&gt; 1 );

       Returns list of hashes. Each hash at least has 'type' key that describes the entry. Types:

       mailbox
           A mailbox entry with Email::Address object under value key.

           If mailbox has obsolete parts then 'obsolete' is true.

           If address (not display-name/phrase or comments, but local-part@domain) contains not ASCII chars then
           'not_ascii'  is  set  to  true. According to RFC 5322 not ASCII chars are not allowed within mailbox.
           However, there are no big problems if those are used and actually RFC 6532 extends a few  rules  from
           5322  with  UTF8-non-ascii.  Either  use  the feature or just skip such addresses with skip_not_ascii
           option.

       group start
           Some headers with mailboxes may contain groupped addresses. This element  is  returned  for  position
           where group starts. Under value key you find name of the group. <b>NOTE</b> that value is not post processed
           at  the moment, so it may contain spaces, comments, quoted strings and other noise. Author willing to
           take patches and warns that this will be changed at some point without additional  notifications,  so
           if you need groups info then you better send a patch :)

           Groups  can  not  be nested, but one field may have multiple groups or mix of addresses that are in a
           group and not in any.

           See skip_groups option.

       group end
           Returned when a group ends.

       comment
           Obsolete syntax allows one to use standalone comments between mailboxes that can not be addressed  to
           any  mailbox. In such situations a comment returned as an entry of this type. Comment itself is under
           value.

       unknown
           Returned if parser met something that shouldn't be there. Parser tries to recover by jumping over  to
           next  comma  (or  semicolon if inside group) that is out quoted string or comment, so "foo, bar, baz"
           string results in three unknown entries. Jumping over comments and quoted strings means  that  parser
           is very sensitive to unbalanced quotes and parens, but it's on purpose.

       It can be controlled which elements are skipped, for example:

           Email::Address::List-&gt;parse($line, skip_unknown =&gt; 1, ...);

       skip_comments
           Skips comments between mailboxes. Comments inside and next to a mailbox are not skipped, but returned
           as part of mailbox entry.

       skip_not_ascii
           Skips mailboxes where address part has not ASCII characters.

       skip_groups
           Skips group starts and end elements, however emails within groups are still returned.

       skip_unknown
           Skip anything that is not recognizable. It still tries to recover as described earlier.
