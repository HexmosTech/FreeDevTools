</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Qpsmtpd::Address - Lightweight E-Mail address objects

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Based originally on cut and paste from Mail::Address and including every jot and tittle from
       RFC-2821/2822 on what is a legal e-mail address for use during the SMTP transaction.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
         my $rcpt = Qpsmtpd::Address-&gt;new('&lt;<a href="mailto:email.address@example.com">email.address@example.com</a>&gt;');

       The objects created can be used as is, since they automatically stringify to a standard form, and they
       have an overloaded comparison for easy testing of values.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new()</b>
       Can be called two ways:

       •   Qpsmtpd::Address-&gt;new('&lt;<a href="mailto:full_address@example.com">full_address@example.com</a>&gt;')

           The  normal  mode  of  operation is to pass the entire contents of the RCPT TO: command from the SMTP
           transaction.  The value will be fully parsed via the canonify method, using the full RFC 2821 rules.

       •   Qpsmtpd::Address-&gt;new("user", "host")

           If the caller has already split the address from the domain/host, this mode  will  not  canonify  the
           input values.  This is not recommended in cases of user-generated input for that reason.  This can be
           used  to  generate Qpsmtpd::Address objects for accounts like "&lt;postmaster&gt;" or indeed for the bounce
           address "&lt;&gt;".

       The resulting objects can be stored in  arrays  or  used  in  plugins  to  test  for  equality  (like  in
       badmailfrom).

   <b>canonify()</b>
       Primarily  an  internal  method,  it is used only on the path portion of an e-mail message, as defined in
       RFC-2821 (this is the part inside the angle brackets and does not include the "human readable" portion of
       an address).  It returns a list of (local-part, domain).

   <b>parse()</b>
       Retained as a compatibility method, it is completely equivalent to <b>new()</b> called with a single parameter.

   <b>address()</b>
       Can be used to reset the value of an existing Q::A object, in which case it takes  a  parameter  with  or
       without the angle brackets.

       Returns  the stringified representation of the address.  NOTE: does not escape any of the characters that
       need escaping, nor does it include the surrounding angle brackets.  For that purpose, see format.

   <b>format()</b>
       Returns the canonical stringified representation of the address.  It does escape any characters requiring
       it (per RFC-2821/2822) and it does include the surrounding  angle  brackets.   It  is  also  the  default
       stringification operator, so the following are equivalent:

         print $rcpt-&gt;format();
         print $rcpt;

   <b>user([$user])</b>
       Returns the "localpart" of the address, per RFC-2821, or the portion before the '@' sign.

       If called with one parameter, the localpart is set and the new value is returned.

   <b>host([$host])</b>
       Returns the "domain" part of the address, per RFC-2821, or the portion after the '@' sign.

       If called with one parameter, the domain is set and the new value is returned.

   <b>notes($key[,$value])</b>
       Get or set a note on the address. This is a piece of data that you wish to attach to the address and read
       somewhere else. For example you can use this to pass data between plugins.
