</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::IMAP::Client::MsgAddress - email address object

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Represents one email address as returned in an ENVELOPE part of the FETCH command.

       When used in string context, this object magically translates to "Full Name &lt;<a href="mailto:email@address.com">email@address.com</a>&gt;".

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"new"</b>  <b>#</b> <b>constructor</b>
       Creates a new object from the given array.

       name
           Returns the full name, if any

       at_domain_list
           Returns the "at_domain_list" part (WTF is that?)

       mailbox
           Returns the mailbox name (i.e. the 'email' part in the example above).

       host
           Returns the host name (i.e. the 'address.com' part).

       email
           Returns the full email address: "$self-"{mailbox} . '@' . $self-&gt;{host}&gt;.

       as_string
           Used    by    stringification.     It   returns   the   full   name   and   email   address   as   in
           "Full Name &lt;<a href="mailto:email@address.com">email@address.com</a>&gt;".
