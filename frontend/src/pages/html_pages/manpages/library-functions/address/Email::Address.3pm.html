       Email::Address - RFC 2822 Address Parsing and Creation

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.913

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Email::Address;

         my @addresses = Email::Address-&gt;parse($line);
         my $address   = Email::Address-&gt;new(Casey =&gt; 'casey@localhost');

         print $address-&gt;format;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class implements a regex-based RFC 2822 parser that locates email addresses in strings and returns a
       list of "Email::Address" objects found.  Alternatively you may construct objects manually. The goal of
       this software is to be correct, and very very fast.

       Version 1.909 and earlier of this module had vulnerabilies (CVE-2015-7686 &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-
       bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7686&gt;) and (CVE-2015-12558 &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-
       bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12558&gt;) which allowed specially constructed email to cause a denial of
       service. The reported vulnerabilities and some other pathalogical cases (meaning they really shouldn't
       occur in normal email) have been addressed in version 1.910 and newer.  If you're running version 1.909
       or older, you should update!

       Alternatively, you could switch to <b>Email::Address::XS</b> which has a backward compatible API. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b>
       <b>use</b> <b>that?</b>

   <b>Package</b> <b>Variables</b>
       <b>ACHTUNG!</b>  Email isn't easy (if even possible) to parse with a regex, <u>at</u> <u>least</u> if you're on a "perl" prior
       to 5.10.0.  Providing regular expressions for use by other programs isn't a great idea, because it makes
       it hard to improve the parser without breaking the "it's a regex" feature.  Using these regular
       expressions is not encouraged, and methods like "Email::Address-&gt;is_addr_spec" should be provided in the
       future.

       Several regular expressions used in this package are useful to others.  For convenience, these variables
       are declared as package variables that you may access from your program.

       These regular expressions conform to the rules specified in RFC 2822.

       You can access these variables using the full namespace. If you want short names, define them yourself.

         my $addr_spec = $Email::Address::addr_spec;

       $Email::Address::addr_spec
           This regular expression defined what an email address is allowed to look like.

       $Email::Address::angle_addr
           This regular expression defines an $addr_spec wrapped in angle brackets.

       $Email::Address::name_addr
           This  regular  expression  defines  what  an  email  address can look like with an optional preceding
           display name, also known as the "phrase".

       $Email::Address::mailbox
           This is the complete regular expression defining an RFC 2822 email address with an optional preceding
           display name and optional following comment.

   <b>Class</b> <b>Methods</b>
       parse
             my @addrs = Email::Address-&gt;parse(
               q[me@local, Casey &lt;me@local&gt;, "Casey" &lt;me@local&gt; (West)]
             );

           This method returns a list of "Email::Address" objects it finds in the  input  string.   <b>Please</b>  <b>note</b>
           that  it  returns  a  list,  and expects that it may find multiple addresses.  The behavior in scalar
           context is undefined.

           The specification for an email address allows for  infinitely  nestable  comments.   That's  nice  in
           theory,  but a little over done.  By default this module allows for one (1) level of nested comments.
           If you think you need more, modify the $Email::Address::COMMENT_NEST_LEVEL package variable to  allow
           more.

             $Email::Address::COMMENT_NEST_LEVEL = 10; # I'm deep

           The reason for this hardly-limiting limitation is simple: efficiency.

           Long  strings of whitespace can be problematic for this module to parse, a bug which has not yet been
           adequately addressed.  The default behavior is now to collapse multiple spaces into a  single  space,
           which  avoids  this problem.  To prevent this behavior, set $Email::Address::COLLAPSE_SPACES to zero.
           This variable will go away when the bug is resolved properly.

           In accordance with RFC 822 and its descendants, this module demands that  email  addresses  be  ASCII
           only.  Any non-ASCII content in the parsed addresses will cause the parser to return no results.

       new
             my $address = Email::Address-&gt;new(undef, 'casey@local');
             my $address = Email::Address-&gt;new('Casey West', 'casey@local');
             my $address = Email::Address-&gt;new(undef, 'casey@local', '(Casey)');

           Constructs and returns a new "Email::Address" object. Takes four positional arguments: phrase, email,
           and comment, and original string.

           The original string should only really be set using "parse".

       purge_cache
             Email::Address-&gt;purge_cache;

           One way this module stays fast is with internal caches. Caches live in memory and there is the remote
           possibility that you will have a memory problem. On the off chance that you think you're one of those
           people, this class method will empty those caches.

           I've loaded over 12000 objects and not encountered a memory problem.

       disable_cache
       enable_cache
             Email::Address-&gt;disable_cache if memory_low();

           If  you'd  rather not cache address parses at all, you can disable (and re-enable) the Email::Address
           cache with these methods.  The cache is enabled by default.

   <b>Instance</b> <b>Methods</b>
       phrase
             my $phrase = $address-&gt;phrase;
             $address-&gt;phrase( "Me oh my" );

           Accessor and mutator for the phrase portion of an address.

       address
             my $addr = $address-&gt;address;
             $addr-&gt;address( "<a href="mailto:me@PROTECTED.com">me@PROTECTED.com</a>" );

           Accessor and mutator for the address portion of an address.

       comment
             my $comment = $address-&gt;comment;
             $address-&gt;comment( "(Work address)" );

           Accessor and mutator for the comment portion of an address.

       original
             my $orig = $address-&gt;original;

           Accessor for the original address found when parsing, or passed to "new".

       host
             my $host = $address-&gt;host;

           Accessor for the host portion of an address's address.

       user
             my $user = $address-&gt;user;

           Accessor for the user portion of an address's address.

       format
             my $printable = $address-&gt;format;

           Returns a properly formatted RFC 2822 address representing the object.

       name
             my $name = $address-&gt;name;

           This method tries very hard to determine the name belonging to the address.  First  the  "phrase"  is
           checked.  If  that doesn't work out the "comment" is looked into. If that still doesn't work out, the
           "user" portion of the "address" is returned.

           This method does <b>not</b> try to massage any name it identifies and instead  leaves  that  up  to  someone
           else. Who is it to decide if someone wants their name capitalized, or if they're Irish?

   <b>Overloaded</b> <b>Operators</b>
       stringify
             print "I have your email address, $address.";

           Objects  stringify  to  "format" by default. It's possible that you don't like that idea. Okay, then,
           you can change it by modifying $Email:Address::STRINGIFY.  Please  consider  modifying  this  package
           variable using "local". You might step on someone else's toes if you don't.

             {
               local $Email::Address::STRINGIFY = 'host';
               print "I have your address, $address.";
               #   geeknest.com
             }
             print "I have your address, $address.";
             #   "Casey West" &lt;<a href="mailto:casey@geeknest.com">casey@geeknest.com</a>&gt;

           Modifying this package variable is now deprecated. Subclassing is now the recommended approach.

       On his 1.8GHz Apple MacBook, rjbs gets these results:

         Email::Address 8.53/s           232%             --

       ...unfortunately,  a  known  bug  causes  a  loss  of  speed  the  string  to  parse  has  certain  known
       characteristics, and disabling cache will also degrade performance.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any  version  of  perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although  it  may  work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Thanks to Kevin Riggle and Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for tests for annoying phrase-quoting bugs!
