       RDF::vCard::Exporter - export RDF data to vCard format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use RDF::vCard;

        my $input    = "<a href="http://example.com/contact-data.rdf">http://example.com/contact-data.rdf</a>";
        my $exporter = RDF::vCard::Exporter-&gt;new(vcard_version =&gt; 3);

        print $_ foreach $exporter-&gt;export_cards($input);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module reads RDF and writes vCards.

   <b>Constructor</b>
       •   new(%options)

           Returns a new RDF::vCard::Exporter object.

           Options:

           •   <b>vcard_version</b>  -  '3'  or '4'. This module will happily use vCard 3.0 constructs in vCard 4.0 and
               vice versa. But in certain places it can lean one way or the other. This  option  allows  you  to
               influence that.

   <b>Methods</b>
       •   "export_cards($input, %options)"

           Returns a list of vCards found in the input, in no particular order.

           The  input  may  be  a  URI, file name, RDF::Trine::Model or anything else that can be handled by the
           "rdf_parse" method of RDF::TrineShortcuts.

           Supported options include <b>sort</b> which, if set to true, causes the output to be sorted by name (as well
           as is possible); <b>source</b> which allows you to provide the URL where the cards were  sourced  from;  and
           <b>prodid</b> which allows you to set the product ID used in the output.

           (A  prodid must be in FPI format to be valid, though the module doesn't check this. undef is allowed.
           By default, RDF::vCard:Exporter uses its own prodid, and unless you have  a  good  reason  to  change
           this, you should probably let it.)

           e.g.

             my @cards = $exporter-&gt;export_cards(
               $some_data,
               sort   =&gt; 1,
               source =&gt; '<a href="http://bigcorp.example.com/data.rdf">http://bigcorp.example.com/data.rdf</a>',
               prodid =&gt; '+//IDN example.net//NONSGML MyScript v 0.1//EN',
               );

           Each item in the list returned is an RDF::vCard::Entity, though that class overloads stringification,
           so you can just treat each item as a string mostly.

       •   "export_card($input, $subject, %options)"

           As per "export_cards" but exports just a single card.

           The  subject  provided  must  be  an  RDF::Trine::Node::Blank  or  RDF::Trine::Node::Resource of type
           v:VCard.

       •   "is_v3"

           Returns true if this exporter is in vCard 3.0 mode.

       •   "is_v4"

           Returns true if this exporter is in vCard 4.0 mode.

   <b>RDF</b> <b>Input</b>
       Input  is  expected  to  use  the  newer  of  the  2010  revision   of   the   W3C's   vCard   vocabulary
       &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/vcard-rdf/">http://www.w3.org/Submission/vcard-rdf/</a>&gt;. (Note that even though this was revised in 2010, the term URIs
       include "2006" in them.)

       Some  extensions  from  the  namespace  &lt;<a href="http://buzzword.org.uk/rdf/vcardx">http://buzzword.org.uk/rdf/vcardx</a>#&gt; are also supported. (Namely:
       vx:usage,  vx:kind,  vx:gender,  vx:sex,  vx:dday,  vx:anniversary,  vx:lang,  vx:caladruri,   vx:caluri,
       vx:fburl, vx:impp, vx:source.)

       The  module  author has made the decision not to support FOAF and other RDF vocabularies that may be used
       to model contact information for people and organisations, as they do not necessarily  map  cleanly  onto
       vCard.  People  hoping  to map non-vCard RDF to vCard using this module may have some luck pre-processing
       their RDF using a rules-based reasoner.

   <b>vCard</b> <b>Output</b>
       The output of this module mostly aims at vCard 3.0 (RFC 2426) compliance.  In the  face  of  weird  input
       data  though,  (e.g. an FN property that is a URI instead of a literal) it can pretty easily descend into
       exporting junk, non-compliant vCards.

       Many vCard 4.0 properties, such as the IMPP and KIND, are also supported.

       The <b>vcard_version</b> constructor option allows you to influence how some properties like GEO and TEL  (which
       differ between 3.0 and 4.0) are output.
