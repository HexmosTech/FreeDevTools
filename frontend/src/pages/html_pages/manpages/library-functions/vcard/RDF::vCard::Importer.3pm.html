       RDF::vCard::Importer - import RDF data from vCard format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use RDF::vCard;
        use RDF::TrineShortcuts qw':all';

        my $importer = RDF::vCard::Importer-&gt;new;
        print $_
               foreach $importer-&gt;import_file('contacts.vcf');
        print rdf_string($importer-&gt;model =&gt; 'RDFXML');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module reads vCards and writes RDF.

   <b>Constructor</b>
       •   new(%options)

           Returns a new RDF::vCard::Importer object and initialises it.

           The  only valid option currently is <b>ua</b> which can be set to an LWP::UserAgent for those rare occasions
           that the Importer needs to fetch stuff from the Web.

   <b>Methods</b>
       •   "init"

           Reinitialise the importer. Forgets any cards that have already been imported.

       •   "model"

           Return an RDF::Trine::Model containing data for all cards that have been imported since the  importer
           was last initialised.

       •   "import_file($filename, %options)"

           Imports vCard data from a file on the file system.

           The data is added to the importer's model (and can be retrieved using the "model" method).

           This  function returns a list of RDF::vCard::Entity objects, so it's also possible to access the data
           that way.

           There is currently only one supported option: "lang" which takes an ISO language code indicating  the
           default language of text within the vCard data.

       •   "import_fh($filehandle, %options)"

           As per "import_file", but operates on a file handle.

       •   "import_string($string, %options)"

           As per "import_file", but operates on vCard data in a string.

       •   import_url($url)

           As per "import_file", but fetches vCard data from a Web address.

           Sends an HTTP Accept header of:

             text/directory;profile=vCard,
             text/vcard,
             text/x-vcard,
             text/directory;q=0.1

   <b>vCard</b> <b>Input</b>
       vCard 3.0 should be supported fairly completely. Some vCard 4.0 constructs will also work.

       Much  of the heavy lifting is performed by Text::vFile::asData, so this module may be affected by bugs in
       that distribution.

   <b>RDF</b> <b>Output</b>
       Output   uses   the   newer    of    the    2010    revision    of    the    W3C's    vCard    vocabulary
       &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/vcard-rdf/">http://www.w3.org/Submission/vcard-rdf/</a>&gt;. (Note that even though this was revised in 2010, the term URIs
       include "2006" in them.)

       Some extensions from the namespace &lt;<a href="http://buzzword.org.uk/rdf/vcardx">http://buzzword.org.uk/rdf/vcardx</a>#&gt; are also output.

       The AGENT property is currently omitted from output. This will be added in a later version.
