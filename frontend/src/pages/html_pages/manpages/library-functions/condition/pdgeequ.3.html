       PDGEEQU - compute row and column scalings intended to equilibrate an M-by-N distributed matrix sub( A ) =
       A(IA:IA+N-1,JA:JA:JA+N-1) and reduce its condition number

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       SUBROUTINE PDGEEQU( M, N, A, IA, JA, DESCA, R, C, ROWCND, COLCND, AMAX, INFO )

           INTEGER         IA, INFO, JA, M, N

           DOUBLE          PRECISION AMAX, COLCND, ROWCND

           INTEGER         DESCA( * )

           DOUBLE          PRECISION A( * ), C( * ), R( * )

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       PDGEEQU  computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate an M-by-N distributed matrix sub( A ) =
       A(IA:IA+N-1,JA:JA:JA+N-1) and reduce its condition number.  R returns the row scale  factors  and  C  the
       column  scale  factors, chosen to try to make the largest entry in each row and column of the distributed
       matrix B with elements B(i,j) = R(i) * A(i,j) * C(j) have absolute value 1.

       R(i) and C(j) are restricted to be between SMLNUM = smallest  safe  number  and  BIGNUM  =  largest  safe
       number.   Use  of  these scaling factors is not guaranteed to reduce the condition number of sub( A ) but
       works well in practice.

       Notes
       =====

       Each global data object is described by  an  associated  description  vector.   This  vector  stores  the
       information required to establish the mapping between an object element and its corresponding process and
       memory location.

       Let  A  be  a  generic  term  for  any  2D  block cyclicly distributed array.  Such a global array has an
       associated description vector DESCA.  In the following comments, the character _ should be  read  as  "of
       the global array".

       NOTATION        STORED IN      EXPLANATION
       ---------------  -------------- -------------------------------------- DTYPE_A(global) DESCA( DTYPE_ )The
       descriptor type.  In this case,
                                      DTYPE_A = 1.
       CTXT_A (global) DESCA( CTXT_ ) The BLACS context handle, indicating
                                      the BLACS process grid A is distribu-
                                      ted over. The context itself is glo-
                                      bal, but the handle (the integer
                                      value) may vary.
       M_A    (global) DESCA( M_ )    The number of rows in the global
                                      array A.
       N_A    (global) DESCA( N_ )    The number of columns in the global
                                      array A.
       MB_A   (global) DESCA( MB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the rows of the array.
       NB_A   (global) DESCA( NB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the columns of the array.
       RSRC_A (global) DESCA( RSRC_ ) The process row over which the first
                                      row of the array A is distributed.  CSRC_A (global)  DESCA(  CSRC_  )  The
       process column over which the
                                      first column of the array A is
                                      distributed.
       LLD_A  (local)  DESCA( LLD_ )  The leading dimension of the local
                                      array.  LLD_A &gt;= MAX(1,LOCr(M_A)).

       Let  K  be  the  number  of rows or columns of a distributed matrix, and assume that its process grid has
       dimension p x q.
       LOCr( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process would receive if K were distributed over the
       p processes of its process column.
       Similarly, LOCc( K ) denotes the number of elements  of  K  that  a  process  would  receive  if  K  were
       distributed over the q processes of its process row.
       The values of LOCr() and LOCc() may be determined via a call to the ScaLAPACK tool function, NUMROC:
               LOCr( M ) = NUMROC( M, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ),
               LOCc(  N ) = NUMROC( N, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ).  An upper bound for these quantities may be
       computed by:
               LOCr( M ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(M/MB_A)/NPROW )*MB_A
               LOCc( N ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(N/NB_A)/NPCOL )*NB_A

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       M       (global input) INTEGER
               The number of rows to be operated on i.e the number of rows of the distributed submatrix  sub(  A
               ). M &gt;= 0.

       N       (global input) INTEGER
               The  number  of  columns to be operated on i.e the number of columns of the distributed submatrix
               sub( A ). N &gt;= 0.

       A       (local input) DOUBLE PRECISION pointer into the local memory
               to an array of dimension ( LLD_A, LOCc(JA+N-1) ), the local  pieces  of  the  M-by-N  distributed
               matrix whose equilibration factors are to be computed.

       IA      (global input) INTEGER
               The row index in the global array A indicating the first row of sub( A ).

       JA      (global input) INTEGER
               The column index in the global array A indicating the first column of sub( A ).

       DESCA   (global and local input) INTEGER array of dimension DLEN_.
               The array descriptor for the distributed matrix A.

       R       (local output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension LOCr(M_A)
               If  INFO  =  0  or  INFO &gt; IA+M-1, R(IA:IA+M-1) contains the row scale factors for sub( A ). R is
               aligned with the distributed matrix A, and replicated across every process column. R is  tied  to
               the distributed matrix A.

       C       (local output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension LOCc(N_A)
               If  INFO = 0,  C(JA:JA+N-1) contains the column scale factors for sub( A ). C is aligned with the
               distributed matrix A, and replicated down every process row. C  is  tied  to  the  distri-  buted
               matrix A.

       ROWCND  (global output) DOUBLE PRECISION
               If  INFO = 0 or INFO &gt; IA+M-1, ROWCND contains the ratio of the smallest R(i) to the largest R(i)
               (IA &lt;= i &lt;= IA+M-1).  If ROWCND &gt;= 0.1 and AMAX is neither too large nor too  small,  it  is  not
               worth scaling by R(IA:IA+M-1).

       COLCND  (global output) DOUBLE PRECISION
               If  INFO  =  0,  COLCND  contains  the ratio of the smallest C(j) to the largest C(j) (JA &lt;= j &lt;=
               JA+N-1). If COLCND &gt;= 0.1, it is not worth scaling by C(JA:JA+N-1).

       AMAX    (global output) DOUBLE PRECISION
               Absolute value of largest distributed matrix element.  If AMAX is very close to overflow or  very
               close to underflow, the matrix should be scaled.

       INFO    (global output) INTEGER
               = 0:  successful exit
               &lt;  0:   If  the  i-th  argument  is  an  array  and the j-entry had an illegal value, then INFO =
               -(i*100+j), if the i-th argument is a scalar and had an illegal value, then INFO = -i.  &gt; 0:   If
               INFO = i,  and i is
               &lt;=  M:   the  i-th  row  of  the distributed matrix sub( A ) is exactly zero, &gt;  M:  the (i-M)-th
               column of the distributed matrix sub( A ) is exactly zero.
