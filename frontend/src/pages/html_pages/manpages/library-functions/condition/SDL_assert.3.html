</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_assert - An assertion test that is normally performed only in debug builds.

</pre><h4><b>HEADER</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Defined in SDL3/SDL_assert.h

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>"SDL3/SDL.h"</b>

       <b>#define</b> <b>SDL_assert(condition)</b> <b>if</b> <b>(assertion_enabled</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>(condition))</b> <b>{</b> <b>trigger_assertion;</b> <b>}</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This macro is enabled when the <b>SDL_ASSERT_LEVEL</b>
        is  &gt;=  2,  otherwise  it is disabled. This is meant to only do these tests in debug builds, so they can
       tend to be more expensive, and they are meant to bring everything to a halt  when  they  fail,  with  the
       programmer there to assess the problem.

       In  short:  you  can sprinkle these around liberally and assume they will evaporate out of the build when
       building for end-users.

       When assertions are disabled, this wraps <b>condition</b> in a <b>sizeof</b> operator, which means any  function  calls
       and  side  effects  will not run, but the compiler will not complain about any otherwise-unused variables
       that are only referenced in the assertion.

       One can set the environment variable " <b>SDL_ASSERT</b> " to one of several strings ("abort", "break", "retry",
       "ignore", "always_ignore") to force a default behavior, which may be desirable for  automation  purposes.
       If  your  platform requires GUI interfaces to happen on the main thread but you're debugging an assertion
       in a background thread, it might be desirable to set this to "break" so that your debugger takes  control
       as  soon  as  assert  is  triggered,  instead  of  risking  a  bad  UI interaction (deadlock, etc) in the
       application.

</pre><h4><b>THREAD</b> <b>SAFETY</b></h4><pre>
       It is safe to call this macro from any thread.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This macro is available since SDL 3.2.0.
