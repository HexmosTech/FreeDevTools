</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       btree - btree database access method

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Standard C library (<u>libc</u>, <u>-lc</u>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</b>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;db.h&gt;</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Note</u>  <u>well</u>: This page documents interfaces provided up until glibc 2.1.  Since glibc 2.2, glibc no longer
       provides these interfaces.  Probably, you are looking for the APIs provided by the <u>libdb</u> library instead.

       The routine <b><a href="../man3/dbopen.3.html">dbopen</a></b>(3) is the library interface to database files.  One of the supported file  formats  is
       btree  files.   The  general description of the database access methods is in <b><a href="../man3/dbopen.3.html">dbopen</a></b>(3), this manual page
       describes only the btree-specific information.

       The btree data structure is a sorted, balanced tree structure storing associated key/data pairs.

       The btree access-method-specific data structure provided to <b><a href="../man3/dbopen.3.html">dbopen</a></b>(3) is defined in  the  <u>&lt;db.h&gt;</u>  include
       file as follows:

           typedef struct {
               unsigned long flags;
               unsigned int  cachesize;
               int           maxkeypage;
               int           minkeypage;
               unsigned int  psize;
               int         (*compare)(const DBT *key1, const DBT *key2);
               size_t      (*prefix)(const DBT *key1, const DBT *key2);
               int           lorder;
           } BTREEINFO;

       The elements of this structure are as follows:

       <u>flags</u>  The flag value is specified by ORing any of the following values:

              <b>R_DUP</b>  Permit  duplicate  keys  in  the  tree, that is, permit insertion if the key to be inserted
                     already exists in the tree.  The  default  behavior,  as  described  in  <b><a href="../man3/dbopen.3.html">dbopen</a></b>(3),  is  to
                     overwrite  a  matching key when inserting a new key or to fail if the <b>R_NOOVERWRITE</b> flag is
                     specified.   The  <b>R_DUP</b>  flag  is  overridden  by  the  <b>R_NOOVERWRITE</b>  flag,  and  if   the
                     <b>R_NOOVERWRITE</b> flag is specified, attempts to insert duplicate keys into the tree will fail.

                     If  the  database  contains  duplicate  keys,  the  order of retrieval of key/data pairs is
                     undefined if the <u>get</u> routine is used, however, <u>seq</u> routine calls with the <b>R_CURSOR</b> flag set
                     will always return the logical "first" of any group of duplicate keys.

       <u>cachesize</u>
              A suggested maximum size (in bytes) of the memory cache.  This value is  <u>only</u>  advisory,  and  the
              access  method  will  allocate more memory rather than fail.  Since every search examines the root
              page of the tree, caching the most recently used pages substantially  improves  access  time.   In
              addition,  physical  writes  are  delayed  as long as possible, so a moderate cache can reduce the
              number of I/O operations significantly.  Obviously, using a cache increases (but  only  increases)
              the  likelihood  of  corruption or lost data if the system crashes while a tree is being modified.
              If <u>cachesize</u> is 0 (no size is specified), a default cache is used.

       <u>maxkeypage</u>
              The maximum number of keys which will be stored on any single page.  Not currently implemented.

       <u>minkeypage</u>
              The minimum number of keys which will be stored on  any  single  page.   This  value  is  used  to
              determine  which  keys  will be stored on overflow pages, that is, if a key or data item is longer
              than the pagesize divided by the minkeypage value, it will be stored on overflow pages instead  of
              in  the page itself.  If <u>minkeypage</u> is 0 (no minimum number of keys is specified), a value of 2 is
              used.

       <u>psize</u>  Page size is the size (in bytes) of the pages used for nodes in the tree.  The minimum  page  size
              is  512  bytes  and the maximum page size is 64 KiB.  If <u>psize</u> is 0 (no page size is specified), a
              page size is chosen based on the underlying filesystem I/O block size.

       <u>compare</u>
              Compare is the key comparison function.  It must return an integer less than, equal to, or greater
              than zero if the first key argument is considered to be  respectively  less  than,  equal  to,  or
              greater  than  the second key argument.  The same comparison function must be used on a given tree
              every time it is opened.  If <u>compare</u> is NULL (no comparison function is specified), the  keys  are
              compared lexically, with shorter keys considered less than longer keys.

       <u>prefix</u> Prefix  is  the  prefix comparison function.  If specified, this routine must return the number of
              bytes of the second key argument which are necessary to determine that  it  is  greater  than  the
              first  key  argument.   If  the  keys  are  equal,  the  key length should be returned.  Note, the
              usefulness  of  this  routine  is  very  data-dependent,  but,  in  some  data  sets  can  produce
              significantly  reduced  tree  sizes  and  search  times.  If <u>prefix</u> is NULL (no prefix function is
              specified), <u>and</u> no comparison function is specified, a default lexical comparison routine is used.
              If <u>prefix</u> is NULL and a comparison routine is specified, no prefix comparison is done.

       <u>lorder</u> The byte order for integers in the stored database metadata.   The  number  should  represent  the
              order  as an integer; for example, big endian order would be the number 4,321.  If <u>lorder</u> is 0 (no
              order is specified), the current host order is used.

       If the file already exists (and the <b>O_TRUNC</b>  flag  is  not  specified),  the  values  specified  for  the
       arguments <u>flags</u>, <u>lorder</u>, and <u>psize</u> are ignored in favor of the values used when the tree was created.

       Forward sequential scans of a tree are from the least key to the greatest.

       Space  freed up by deleting key/data pairs from the tree is never reclaimed, although it is normally made
       available for reuse.  This means that the btree storage structure is grow-only.  The only  solutions  are
       to avoid excessive deletions, or to create a fresh tree periodically from a scan of an existing one.

       Searches, insertions, and deletions in a btree will all complete in O lg base N where base is the average
       fill  factor.   Often,  inserting  ordered  data  into  btrees  results  in  a  low  fill  factor.   This
       implementation has been modified to make ordered insertion the best case, resulting in a much better than
       normal page fill factor.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>btree</u> access method routines may fail and set <u>errno</u> for any of the errors specified for  the  library
       routine <b><a href="../man3/dbopen.3.html">dbopen</a></b>(3).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Only big and little endian byte order is supported.
