</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Video::FourCC::Info - Perl module to retrieve information about FourCCs

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 1.005 ($Id: Info.pm 10585 2009-12-22 02:50:06Z <a href="mailto:FREQUENCY@cpan.org">FREQUENCY@cpan.org</a> $)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In order for video players to detect the algorithm required to decode a given video file, a four-byte
       sequence called a Four Character Code is written somewhere in the header of the file. This ensures that
       the detected codec format is independent of the file extension, which may be incorrect due to human error
       or for some other reason.

       This is similar to the four-byte "magic number" used by the UNIX <b><a href="../man1/file.1.html">file</a></b>(1) command to roughly determine a
       file format.

       Most applications seem to treat this as a case insensitive code. As a result, internally, your given
       FourCC's will be silently converted to uppercase.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Video::FourCC::Info;

         my $codec = Video::FourCC::Info-&gt;new('DIV3');

         printf "Codec description: %s\n", $codec-&gt;description;

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This module was tested under Perl 5.10.0, using Debian Linux. However, because it's Pure Perl and doesn't
       do anything too obscure, it should be compatible with any version of Perl that supports its prerequisite
       modules.

       If you encounter any problems on a different version or architecture, please contact the maintainer.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         Video::FourCC::Info-&gt;new( $fourcc )

       Creates a "Video::FourCC::Info" object, which provides information about the given Four Character Code.
       If the code does not exist in the database, it will return an error.

       Example code:

         my $codec = Video::FourCC::Info-&gt;new('DIV3');

       This method will return an appropriate <b>Video::FourCC::Info</b> object or throw an exception on error.

   <b>describe</b>
         Video::FourCC::Info-&gt;describe( $fourcc )

       This is really just a shortcut to grab the short description of a codec given a Four Character Code as
       input. Note that this is a class method, not an object method.

       Example code:

         my $codec_desc = Video::FourCC::Info-&gt;describe('DIV3');

       Internally, this method creates a temporary object and returns the description, destroying the object due
       to falling out of scope. If you already have a "Video::FourCC::Info" object, then the <b>description</b>
       accessor will provide better performance.

       Note, that just like "new", this class method may throw an exception if the Four Character Code does not
       exist in the database.

       Remember that this value could be "undef" if the information is unknown.

   <b>description</b>
         $codec-&gt;description( )

       This returns the short description of the codec. It may be "undef" if there is no description in the
       database.

       Example code:

         my $codec_desc = $codec-&gt;description;

       Remember that this value could be "undef" if the information is unknown.

   <b>registered</b>
         $codec-&gt;registered( )

       This returns the short description of the codec. It may be "undef" if there is no description in the
       database.

       If "DateTime" is installed, then this will be a DateTime object. Otherwise, it will simply be a string in
       the format "yyyy-mm-dd".

       Example code:

         my $registered = $codec-&gt;registered;

       Remember that this value could be "undef" if the information is unknown.

   <b>owner</b>
         $codec-&gt;owner( )

       This returns the name of the corporation or other entity that owns the FourCC. Generally, this seems to
       be an ad-hoc standard, so it's a listing of the first entity known to use the given FourCC.

       Example code:

         my $owner_name = $codec-&gt;owner;

       Remember that this value could be "undef" if the information is unknown.

   <b>code</b>
         $codec-&gt;code( )

       This returns the Four Character Code corresponding to the current "Video::FourCC::Info" object.

       Example code:

         my $fourcc = $codec-&gt;fourcc;
