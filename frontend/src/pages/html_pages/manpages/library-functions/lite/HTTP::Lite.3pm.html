</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTTP::Lite - Lightweight HTTP implementation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use HTTP::Lite;
           $http = HTTP::Lite-&gt;new;
           $req = $http-&gt;request("<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a>")
               or die "Unable to get document: $!";
           print $http-&gt;body();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Note:</b> you should look at HTTP::Tiny or LWP before using this module.

       HTTP::Lite is a stand-alone lightweight HTTP/1.1 implementation for perl.  It is not intended as a
       replacement for the fully-featured LWP module.  Instead, it is intended for use in situations where it is
       desirable to install the minimal number of modules to achieve HTTP support, or where LWP is not a good
       candidate due to CPU overhead, such as slower processors.  HTTP::Lite is also significantly faster than
       LWP.

       HTTP::Lite is ideal for CGI (or mod_perl) programs or for bundling for redistribution with larger
       packages where only HTTP GET and POST functionality are necessary.

       HTTP::Lite supports basic POST and GET operations only.  As of 0.2.1, HTTP::Lite supports HTTP/1.1 and is
       compliant with the Host header, necessary for name based virtual hosting.  Additionally, HTTP::Lite now
       supports Proxies.

       As of 2.0.0 HTTP::Lite now supports a callback to allow processing of request data as it arrives.  This
       is useful for handling very large files without consuming memory.

       If you require more functionality, such as FTP or HTTPS, please see libwwwperl (LWP).  LWP is a
       significantly better and more comprehensive package than HTTP::Lite, and should be used instead of
       HTTP::Lite whenever possible.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       new This  is  the  constructor  for  HTTP::Lite.   It  presently takes no arguments.  A future version of
           HTTP::Lite might accept parameters.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       request ( $url, $data_callback, $cbargs )
           Initiates a request to the specified URL.

           Returns undef if an I/O error is encountered, otherwise the HTTP status code will be  returned.   200
           series  status  codes  represent  success,  300  represent  temporary errors, 400 represent permanent
           errors, and 500 represent server errors.

           See <u><a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html</a></u> for detailed information about HTTP status codes.

           The $data_callback parameter, if used, is a way to filter the data as it is  received  or  to  handle
           large transfers.  It must be a function reference, and will be passed: a reference to the instance of
           the  http  request making the callback, a reference to the current block of data about to be added to
           the body, and the $cbargs parameter (which may be anything).  It must return either  a  reference  to
           the data to add to the body of the document, or undef.

           If  set_callback is used, $data_callback and $cbargs are not used.  $cbargs may be either a scalar or
           a reference.

           The data_callback is called as:
             &amp;$data_callback( $self, $dataref, $cbargs )

           An example use to save a document to file is:

             # Write the data to the filehandle $cbargs
             sub savetofile {
               my ($self,$phase,$dataref,$cbargs) = @_;
               print $cbargs $$dataref;
               return undef;
             }

             $url = "$testpath/bigbinary.dat";
             open OUT, '&gt;','bigbinary.dat';
             $res = $http-&gt;request($url, \&amp;savetofile, OUT);
             close OUT;

       set_callback ( $functionref, $dataref )
           At various stages of the request, callbacks may be used to modify the behaviour  or  to  monitor  the
           status  of  the  request.   These  work  like the $data_callback parameter to <b>request()</b>, but are more
           versatile.  Using set_callback disables $data_callback in <b>request()</b>

           The callbacks are called as:
             callback ( $self, $phase, $dataref, $cbargs )

           The current phases are:

             connect - connection has been established and headers are being
                       transmitted.

             content-length - return value is used as the content-length.  If undef,
                       and prepare_post() was used, the content length is
                       calculated.

             done-headers - all headers have been sent

             content - return value is used as content and is sent to client.  Return
                       undef to use the internal content defined by prepare_post().

             content-done - content has been successfuly transmitted.

             data - A block of data has been received.  The data is referenced by
                       $dataref.  The return value is dereferenced and replaces the
                       content passed in.  Return undef to avoid using memory for large
                       documents.

             done - Request is done.

       prepare_post ( $hashref )
           Takes a reference to a hashed array of post form variables to upload.  Create the HTTP body and  sets
           the method to POST.

       http11_mode ( 0 | 1 )
           Turns  on  or off HTTP/1.1 support.  This is off by default due to broken HTTP/1.1 servers.  Use 1 to
           enable HTTP/1.1 support.

       add_req_header ( $header, $value )
       get_req_header ( $header )
       delete_req_header ( $header )
           Add, Delete, or get a HTTP header(s) for the request.  These functions  allow  you  to  override  any
           header.   Presently,  Host,  User-Agent,  Content-Type, Accept, and Connection are pre-defined by the
           HTTP::Lite module.  You may not override Host, Connection, or Accept.

           If you call "add_req_header()" with $value set to "undef", then the header won't be added.

           To provide (proxy) authentication or authorization, you would use:

               use HTTP::Lite;
               use MIME::Base64;
               $http = HTTP::Lite-&gt;new;
               $encoded = encode_base64('username:password');
               $http-&gt;add_req_header("Authorization", $encoded);

           <b>NOTE</b>: The present implementation limits you to one instance of each header.

       body
           Returns the body of the document returned by the remote server.

       headers_array
           Returns an array of the HTTP headers returned by the remote server.

       headers_string
           Returns a string representation of the HTTP headers returned by the remote server.

       get_header ( $header )
           Returns an array of values for the requested header.

           <b>NOTE</b>: HTTP requests are not limited to a single instance of each header.  As a result, there  may  be
           more than one entry for every header.

       protocol
           Returns  the  HTTP  protocol  identifier,  as  reported by the remote server.  This will generally be
           either HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1.

       proxy ( $proxy_server )
           The URL or hostname of the proxy to use for the next request.

       status
           Returns the HTTP status code returned by the server.  This is also reported as the  return  value  of
           <u><b>request()</b></u>.

       status_message
           Returns  the  textual description of the status code as returned by the server.  The status string is
           not required to adhere to any particular format, although most HTTP servers use  a  standard  set  of
           descriptions.

       reset
           You must call this prior to re-using an HTTP::Lite handle, otherwise the results are undefined.

       local_addr ( $ip )
           Explicity select the local IP address.  0.0.0.0 (default) lets the system choose.

       local_port ( $port )
           Explicity select the local port.  0 (default and recommended) lets the system choose.

       method ( $method )
           Explicity  set  the  method.   Using prepare_post or reset overrides this setting.  Usual choices are
           GET, POST, PUT, HEAD

           # Get and print out the headers and body of the CPAN homepage
           use HTTP::Lite;
           $http = HTTP::Lite-&gt;new;
           $req = $http-&gt;request("<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a>")

             if $req ne "200";
           @headers = $http-&gt;headers_array();
           $body = $http-&gt;body();
           foreach $header (@headers)
           {
             print "$header$CRLF";
           }
           print "$CRLF";
           print "$body$CRLF";

           # POST a query to the dejanews USENET search engine
           use HTTP::Lite;
           $http = HTTP::Lite-&gt;new;
           %vars = (
                    "QRY" =&gt; "perl",
                    "ST" =&gt; "MS",
                    "svcclass" =&gt; "dncurrent",
                    "DBS" =&gt; "2"
                   );
           $http-&gt;prepare_post(\%vars);
           $req = $http-&gt;request("<a href="http://www.deja.com/dnquery.xp">http://www.deja.com/dnquery.xp</a>")
             or die "Unable to get document: $!";
           print "req: $req\n";
           print $http-&gt;body();

</pre><h4><b>UNIMPLEMENTED</b></h4><pre>
           - FTP
           - HTTPS (SSL)
           - Authenitcation/Authorizaton/Proxy-Authorization
             are not directly supported, and require MIME::Base64.
           - Redirects (Location) are not automatically followed
           - multipart/form-data POSTs are not directly supported (necessary
             for File uploads).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Some broken HTTP/1.1 servers send incorrect chunk sizes when transferring files.  HTTP/1.1  mode  is  now
       disabled by default.

       This module (HTTP::Lite) is almost certainly not the best module for your needs.

       For most uses HTTP::Tiny is a good choice.  If you need more features, then look at LWP.
