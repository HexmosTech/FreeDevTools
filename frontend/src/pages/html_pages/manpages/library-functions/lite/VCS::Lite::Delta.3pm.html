</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       VCS::Lite::Delta - VCS::Lite differences

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use VCS::Lite;

         # diff

         my $lit = VCS::Lite-&gt;new('/home/me/foo1.txt');
         my $lit2 = VCS::Lite-&gt;new('/home/me/foo2.txt');
         my $difftxt = $lit-&gt;delta($lit2)-&gt;diff;
         print OUTFILE $difftxt;

         # patch

         my $delt = VCS::Lite::Delta-&gt;new('/home/me/patch.diff');
         my $lit3 = $lit-&gt;patch($delt);
         print OUTFILE $lit3-&gt;text;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a Delta class for the differencing functionality of VCS::Lite

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       The underlying object of VCS::Lite::Delta is an array of difference chunks (hunks) such as that returned
       by Algorithm::Diff.

       The constructor takes the following forms:

         my $delt = VCS::Lite::Delta-&gt;new( '/my/file.diff',$sep); # File name
         my $delt = VCS::Lite::Delta-&gt;new( \*FILE,$sep);       # File handle
         my $delt = VCS::Lite::Delta-&gt;new( \$string,$sep); # String as scalar ref
         my $delt = VCS::Lite::Delta-&gt;new( \@foo, $id1, $id2) # Array ref

       $sep here is a regexp by which to split strings into tokens.  The default is to use the natural perl
       mechanism of $/ (which is emulated when not reading from a file). The arrayref form is assuming an array
       of hunks such as the output from Algorithm::Diff::diff.

       The other forms assume the input is the text form of a diff listing, either in diff format, or in unified
       format. The input is parsed, and errors are reported.

   <b>diff</b>
         print OUTFILE $delt-&gt;diff

       This generates a standard diff format, for example:

       4c4 &lt; Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?  --- &gt; Now wherefore stoppest thou me?

   <b>udiff</b>
         print OUTFILE $delt-&gt;udiff

       This generates a unified diff (like diff -u) similar to the form in which patches are submitted.

   <b>id</b>
         my ($id1,$id2) = $delt-&gt;id;
         $delt2-&gt;id('foo.pl@@1','foo.pl@@3')

       The <u>id</u> method allows get and set of the names associated with the two elements being diffed. The id is
       set for delta objects returned by VCS::Lite-&gt;diff, to the element IDs of the VCS::Lite objects being
       diffed.

       Diff format omits the file names, hence the IDs will not be populated by new. This is not the case with
       diff -u format, which includes the file names which are passed in and available as IDs.

   <b>hunks</b>
         my @hunklist = $delt-&gt;hunks

       A hunk is a technical term for a section of input containing a difference.  Each hunk is an arrayref,
       containing the block of lines. Each line is itself an arrayref, for example:

         [
           [ '+', 9, 'use Acme::Foo;'],
           [ '-', 9, 'use Acme::Bar;'],
         ]

       See the documentation on Algorithm::Diff for more details of this structure.
