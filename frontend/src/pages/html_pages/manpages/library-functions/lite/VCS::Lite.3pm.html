       VCS::Lite - Minimal version control system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use VCS::Lite;

         # diff

         my $lit = VCS::Lite-&gt;new('/home/me/foo1.txt');
         my $lit2 = VCS::Lite-&gt;new('/home/me/foo2.txt');
         my $difftxt = $lit-&gt;delta($lit2)-&gt;diff;
         print OUTFILE $difftxt;

         # patch

         my $delt = VCS::Lite::Delta-&gt;new('/home/me/patch.diff');
         my $lit3 = $lit-&gt;patch($delt);
         print OUTFILE $lit3-&gt;text;

         # merge

         my $lit4 = $lit-&gt;merge($lit-&gt;delta($lit2),$lit-&gt;delta($lit3));
         print OUTFILE $lit4-&gt;text;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides the functions normally associated with a version control system, but without needing
       or implementing a version control system. Applications include wikis, document management systems and
       configuration management.

       It makes use of the module Algorithm::Diff. It provides the facility for basic diffing, patching and
       merging.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       The underlying storage concept of VCS::Lite is an array. The members of the array can be anything that a
       scalar can represent (including references to structures and objects). The default is for the object to
       hold an array of scalars as strings corresponding to lines of text.

       The basic form of the constructor is as follows:

         my $lite = VCS::Lite-&gt;new( '/my/file');

       which slurps the file to make an object. The full form is as follows:

         my $lite = VCS::Lite-&gt;new( $object_id, $separation, $source, ...);

       $object_id
           This  is  a  string  to  identify  what  is  being  diffed,  patched  or merged, in the application's
           environment. If there is no $source, this is used as a filename from which to read the content.

       $separation
           This is an optional parameter, which can be used via $/ to split the  input  file  into  tokens.  The
           default  is  for  lines  of  text.  If  you pass in a string to be tokenized, this will use $sep as a
           regular expression

           $separation can be a scalar or scalar ref, where this is used to  break  up  the  input  stream.  All
           values permitted for $/ are allowed (see perlvar).

           $separation can also be a hashref, to give a finer level of control. For example:

             {  in =&gt; '\n',
                out =&gt; '\n',
                chomp =&gt; 1 }

           'in' is the input record separator to use (the same as you would pass as $sep).  Note that all values
           allowed  for  $/,  and  indeed  the value of $/ passed in is what is used as a default. 'in' can be a
           string or a regexp.

           'out' is the character used on joining the members to output  the  results  (text  method  in  scalar
           context).  This  is  the output record separator $\. Note that 'out' defaults differently depening on
           the setting of 'chomp': if 'chomp' is off, 'out' will default to the  empty  string,  or  rather  the
           passed  in  value  of $\. If 'chomp' is on, 'out' will default to 'in' - note that you should specify
           'out' explicitly if you are using a regexp for 'in'.

           If the 'chomp' flag is set, the text matching 'in' is removed from the input lines as they are  read.
           'chomp' is not on by default, as this is new functionality in release 0.08.

       $source
           if  unspecified  causes  $object_id  to  be  opened  as  a  file and its entire contents read in. The
           alternative is to supply $source, which can be one of the following:

           "scalar"
               This is a string which is tokenized using $separation

           "arrayref"
               Array of tokens

           "filehandle" or "globref"
               Contents of file are slurped

           "callback"
               This is called successively to obtain tokens until received undef.

       In the Perl spirit of DWIM, new assumes that given an arrayref, you have already done  all  the  work  of
       making  your  list of whatevers. Given a string (filename) or a file handle, the file is slurped, reading
       each line of text into a member of the array. Given a callback, the routine is called  successively  with
       arguments $p1, $p2, etc. and is expected to return a scalar which is added (pushed on) to the array.

   <b>apply</b>
         $lite-&gt;apply($lite2);
         $lite-&gt;apply($lite3, base =&gt; 'original');

       This  method  call corresponds approximately to a version control system's check-in function. This causes
       $lite to be modified, so that its contents now reflect those of $lite2.

       $lite does retain the original contents, available via original. However, unlike  in  a  version  control
       system, the object holds only the first original and latest contents.

       The  VCS::Lite object passed in can also have its own original version. If this is the case, merging will
       be performed to incorporate the change as if it had come from a  different  branch.  To  facilitiate  the
       merging  process,  optionally specify a base version, which can be the string 'original', 'contents' (the
       default) or a VCS::Lite object whose contents will be used.  This corresponds to the "common ancestor" in
       version control systems.

   <b>original</b>
       This returns a VCS::Lite object for the original version, before changes were applied with apply.

   <b>text</b>
         my $foo = $lite-&gt;text;
         my $bar = $lit2-&gt;text('|');
         my @baz = $lit3-&gt;text;

       In scalar context, returns  the  equivalent  of  the  file  contents  slurped  (the  optional  separation
       parameter,  defaulting to $_, is used to join the strings together). In list context, returns the list of
       lines or records.

   <b>id</b>
         my $fil = $lite-&gt;id

       Returns the name associated with the VCS::Lite element when it was created by new. This  is  usually  the
       file name.

   <b>delta</b>
         my $delt = $lit-&gt;delta($lit2);

       Perform the difference between two VCS::Lite objects. This object returns a VCS::Lite::Delta object.

   <b>diff</b>
       This   is   for  backward  compatibility  with  early  versions.  $lite-&gt;diff($lite2)  is  equivalent  to
       $lite-&gt;delta($lite2)-&gt;diff.

   <b>patch</b>
         my $lit3 = $lit-&gt;patch($delt);

       Applies a patch to a VCS::Lite object. Accepts a file handle or file name string. Reads the file in  diff
       format, and applies it. Returns a VCS::Lite object for the patched source.

   <b>merge</b>
         my $lit4 = $lit-&gt;merge($lit1,$lit2,\&amp;confl);

       Performs  the  "parallelogram  of  merging".  This  applies  two  different change streams represented by
       VCS::Lite objects. Returns a VCS::Lite object with both sets of changes merged.

       The third parameter to the method is a sub which is called whenever a merge conflict occurs.  This  needs
       to either resolve the conflict or insert the necessary text to highlight the conflict.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS,</b> <b>PATCHES</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>FIXES</b></h4><pre>
       At the time of release there is one known bug within VCS-Lite:

       <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html">http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html</a>?id=20738

       Unfortunately  Ivor's  original  svn  repository  is  no longer available, and any work which had done on
       fixing this bug has now been lost. As time allows I will review the examples  and  try  to  implement  an
       appropriate solution.

       If  you  spot a bug or are experiencing difficulties that are not explained within the POD documentation,
       please send an email to <a href="mailto:barbie@cpan.org">barbie@cpan.org</a> or submit a bug to the RT system (see link  below).  However,  it
       would help greatly if you are able to pinpoint problems or even supply a patch.

       <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html">http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html</a>?Name=VCS-Lite

       Fixes are dependent upon their severity and my availability. Should a fix not be forthcoming, please feel
       free to (politely) remind me.
