</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MIME::Lite::HTML - Provide routine to transform a HTML page in a MIME-Lite mail

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         perl -MMIME::Lite::HTML -e '
            new MIME::Lite::HTML
                From     =&gt; "MIME-Lite\@alianwebserver.com",
                To       =&gt; "alian\@cpan.org",
                Url      =&gt; "<a href="http://localhost/server-status">http://localhost/server-status</a>";'

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       $Revision: 1.23 $

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is a Perl mail client interface for sending message that support HTML format and build them
       for you..  This module provide routine to transform a HTML page in MIME::Lite mail.  So you need this
       module to use MIME-Lite-HTML possibilities

   <b>What's</b> <b>happen</b> <b>?</b>
       The job done is:

       •   Get the file (LWP) if needed

       •   Parse page to find include images (gif, jpg, flash)

       •   Attach them to mail with adequat header if asked (default)

       •   Include external CSS,Javascript file

       •   Replace relative url with absolute one

       •   Build the final MIME-Lite object with each part found

   <b>Usage</b>
       Did  you alread see link like "Send this page to a friend" ?. With this module, you can do script that to
       this in 3 lines.

       It can be used too in  a  HTML  newsletter.  You  make  a  classic  HTML  page,  and  give  just  url  to
       MIME::Lite::HTML.

   <b>Construction</b>
       MIME-Lite-HTML use a MIME-Lite object, and RFC2557 construction:

       If images and text are present, construction use is:

         --&gt; multipart/alternative
         ------&gt; text/plain
         ------&gt; multipart/related
         -------------&gt; text/html
         -------------&gt; each images

       If no images but text is present, this is that:

         ---&gt; multipart/alternative
         -------&gt; text/plain if present
         -------&gt; text/html

       If images but no text, this is:

         ---&gt; multipart/related
         -------&gt; text/html
         -------&gt; each images

       If no images and no text, this is:

         ---&gt; text/html

   <b>Documentation</b>
       Additional documentation can be found here:

       •   MIME-lite module

       •   RFC  822,  RFC 1521, RFC 1522 and specially RFC 2557 (MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate Documents, such
           as HTML)

   <b>Clients</b> <b>tested</b>
       HTML in mail is not full supported so this module can't work with  all  email  clients.  If  some  client
       recognize HTML, they didn't support images include in HTML. So in fact, they recognize multipart/relative
       but not multipart/related.

       Netscape Messager (Linux-Windows)
           100% ok

       Outlook Express (Windows-Mac)
           100%  ok.  Mac  work only with Content-Location header. Thx to Steve Benbow for give mr this feedback
           and for his test.

       Eudora (Windows)
           If this module just send HTML and text, (without images), 100% ok.

           With images, Eudora didn't recognize multipart/related part as describe in RFC 2557 even  if  he  can
           read  his  own HTML mail. So if images are present in HTML part, text and HTML part will be displayed
           both, text part in first.  Two additional headers will be displayed in HTML part too  in  this  case.
           Version  1.0  of  this  module  correct major problem of headers displayed with image include in HTML
           part.

       KMail (Linux)
           If this module just send HTML and text, (without images), 100% ok.

           In other case, Kmail didn't support image include in HTML. So if you set in  KMail  "Prefer  HTML  to
           text", it display HTML with images broken. Otherwise, it display text part.

       Pegasus (Windows)
           If this module just send HTML and text, (without images), 100% ok.

           Pegasus  didn't  support  images in HTML. When it find a multipart/related message, it ignore it, and
           display text part.

       If you find others mail client who support (or not support) MIME-Lite-HTML module, give me some  feedback
       !  If  you  want  be sure that your mail can be read by maximum of people, (so not only OE and Netscape),
       don't include images in your mail, and use a text buffer too. If multipart/related mail is not recognize,
       multipart/alternative can be read by the most of mail client.

</pre><h4><b>Public</b> <b>Interface</b></h4><pre>
       new(%hash)
           Create a new instance of MIME::Lite::HTML.

           The hash can have this key : [Url], [Proxy], [Debug], [IncludeType],
            [HashTemplate], [LoginDetails], [TextCharset], [HTMLCharset],
            [TextEncoding], [HTMLEncoding], [remove_jscript]

           Url ... is url to parse and send. If this param is found, call of parse routine and send of  mail  is
               done. Else you must use parse routine of MIME::Lite::HTML and send of MIME::Lite.

           Proxy
               ... is url of proxy to use.

                 Eg: Proxy =&gt; '<a href="http://192.168.100.166">http://192.168.100.166</a>:8080'

           remove_jscript
               if set, remove all script code from html source

                 Eg: remove_jscript =&gt; 1

           Debug
               ... is trace to stdout during parsing.

                 Eg: Debug =&gt; 1

           IncludeType
               ... is method to use when finding images:

               location
                   Default method is embed them in mail with 'Content-Location' header.

               cid You use a 'Content-CID' header.

               extern
                   Images  are  not embed, relative url are just replace with absolute, so images are fetch when
                   user read mail. (Server must be reachable !)

           ExternImages
               This is a listref of regular expressions.  If an image matches any of the regular expressions, it
               will be rendered as an &lt;img&gt; link,  without  being  attached  to  the  mail,  regardless  of  the
               IncludeType setting above.  For example:

                 ExternImages =&gt; [ '.*cat\.jpg.*', 'external/.*' ]

               ...would mean that "images/cat.jpg" and "external/foo.jpg" would be sent as external &lt;img&gt; links,
               but "images/dog.jpg" would be sent using whatever the default IncludeType (above) is.

           $hash{'HashTemplate'}
               ...  is  a  reference  to  a  hash. If present, MIME::Lite::HTML will substitute &lt;? $name ?&gt; with
               $hash{'HashTemplate'}{'name'} when parse url to send. $hash{'HashTemplate'} can be used  too  for
               include data for subelement.  Eg:

                 $hash{'HashTemplate'}{'<a href="http://www.al.com/images/sommaire.gif">http://www.al.com/images/sommaire.gif</a>'}=\@data;

               or

                 $hash{'HashTemplate'}{'<a href="http://www.al.com/script.js">http://www.al.com/script.js</a>'}="alert("Hello world");;

               When  module find the image <a href="http://www.alianwebserver.com/images/sommaire.gif">http://www.alianwebserver.com/images/sommaire.gif</a> in buffer, it don't
               get image with LWP but use data found in $hash{'HashTemplate'}. (See eg/example2.pl)

           LoginDetails
               ... is the couple user:password for use with restricted url.

                 Eg: LoginDetails =&gt; 'my_user:my_password'

           TextCharset
               ... is the character set to use for the text part.

                 Eg: TextCharset =&gt; 'iso-8859-7'

               for Greek. If none specified, the default is used (iso-8859-1).

           HTMLCharset
               ... is the character set to use for the html part.

                 Eg:  HTMLCharset =&gt; 'iso-8859-7'

               for Greek. If none specified, the default is used (iso-8859-1).  Take care, as that  option  does
               NOT  change  the  character  set  of the HTML page, it only changes the character set of the mime
               part.

           TextEncoding
               ... is the Encoding to be used for the text part (if such a part exists). If none specified,  the
               default is used (7bit).

                 Eg: TextEncoding =&gt; 'base64'

           HTMLEncoding
               ... is the Encoding to be used for the html part. If none specified, the default is used (quoted-
               printable).

                 Eg: HTMLEncoding =&gt; 'base64'.

           Others keys are use with MIME::Lite constructor.

           This  MIME-Lite  keys are: Bcc, Encrypted, Received, Sender, Cc, From, References, Subject, Comments,
           Keywords,  Reply-To  To,  Content-*,  Message-ID,Resent-*,   X-*,Date,   MIME-Version,   Return-Path,
           Organization

       parse($html, [$url_txt], [$url_base])
           Subroutine used for created HTML mail with MIME-Lite

           Parameters:

           $html
               Url  of  HTML  file  to send, can be a local file. If $url is not an url (http or https or ftp or
               file or nntp), $url is used as a buffer.  Example :

                 <a href="http://www.alianwebserver.com">http://www.alianwebserver.com</a>
                 file://c|/tmp/index.html
                 &lt;img src=toto.gif&gt;

           $url_txt
               Url of text part to send for person who doesn't support HTML mail.  As $html, $url_txt can  be  a
               simple buffer.

           $url_base
               $url_base is used if $html is a buffer, for get element found in HTML buffer.

           Return the MIME::Lite part to send

       <b>size()</b>
           Display  size of mail in characters (so octets) that will be send.  (So use it *after* parse method).
           Use this method for control size of mail send, I personnaly hate receive 500k by mail.  I pay  for  a
           33k modem :-(

         # Call this script like this :
         # script.cgi?email=<a href="mailto:myfriend@isp.com">myfriend@isp.com</a>&amp;url=<a href="http://www.go.com">http://www.go.com</a>
         use strict;
         use CGI qw/:standard/;
         use CGI::Carp qw/fatalsToBrowser/;
         use MIME::Lite::HTML;

         my $mailHTML = new MIME::Lite::HTML
