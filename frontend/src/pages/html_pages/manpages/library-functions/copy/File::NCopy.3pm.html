       File::NCopy - Deprecated module. Use File::Copy::Recursive instead. Copy file, file. Copy file[s] |
       dir[s], dir

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use File::NCopy qw(copy);

           copy "file","other_file";
           copy "file1","file2","file3","directory";

           # we want to copy the directory recursively
           copy \1,"directory1","directory2";
           copy \1,"file1","file2","directory1","file3","directory2","file4",
               "directory";

           # can also use references to file handles, this is for backward
           # compatibility with File::Copy
           copy \*FILE1,\*FILE2;
           copy \*FILE1,"file";
           copy "file1",\*FILE2;

           # we don't specify \1 as the first argument because we don't want to
           # copy directories recursively
           copy "*.c","*.pl","programs";
           copy "*", "backup";

           use File::NCopy;

           # the below are the default config values
           $file = File::NCopy-&gt;new(
                   'recursive'      =&gt; 0,
                   'preserve'       =&gt; 0,
                   'follow_links'   =&gt; 0,
                   'force_write'   =&gt; 0,
                   'set_permission' =&gt; \&amp;File::NCopy::u_chmod,
                   'file_check'     =&gt; \&amp;File::NCopy::f_check,
                   'set_times'      =&gt; \&amp;File::NCopy::s_times,
           );

           set_permission will take two file names, the original to get the
           file permissions from and the new file to set the file permissions
           for.

           file_check takes two parameters, the file names to check the file to
           copy from and the file to copy to. I am using flock for Unix
           systems.
           Default for this is \&amp;File::NCopy::f_check.  On Unix you can also use
           \&amp;File::NCopy::unix_check.  This one compares the inode and device
           numbers.

           set_times is used if the preserve attribute is true.  It preserves
           the access and modification time of the file and also attempts to
           set the owner of the file to the original owner.  This can be useful
           in a script used by root, though enyone can preserve the access and
           modification times. This also takes two arguments.  The file to get
           the stats from and apply the stats to.

           On Unix boxes you shouldn't need to worry.  On other system you may
           want to supply your own sub references.

           $file = File::NCopy-&gt;new(recursive =&gt; 1);
           $file-&gt;copy "file","other_file";
           $file-&gt;copy "directory1","directory2";

           $file = File::NCopy-&gt;new(u_chmod =&gt; \&amp;my_chmod,f_check =&gt; \&amp;my_fcheck);
           $file-&gt;copy "directory1","directory2";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>File::NCopy::copy</b> copies files to directories, or a single file to another file.  You can also use a
       reference to a file handle if you wish whem doing a file to file copy.  The functionality is very similar
       to <b>cp</b>.  If the argument is a directory to directory copy and the recursive flag is set then it is done
       recursively like <b>cp</b> <b>-R</b>.  In fact it behaves like cp on Unix for the most part.  If called in array
       context, an array of successful copies is returned, otherwise the number of successful copies is
       returned.  If passed a file handle, it's difficult to make sure the file we are copying isn't the same
       that we are copying to, since by opening the file in write mode it gets pooched.  To avoid this use file
       names instead, if at all possible, especially for the to file.  If passed a file handle, it is not closed
       when copy returns, files opened by copy are closed.

       <b>copy</b>
           Copies  a  file  to  another  file.   Or a file to a directory.  Or multiple files and directories to
           another directory.  Or a directory to another directory.  Wildcard arguments are expanded, except for
           the last argument which should not be expanded.  The file and directory permissions are  set  to  the
           originating file's permissions and if preserve is set the access and modification times are also set.
           If  preserve  is  set then the uid and gid will also be attempted to be set, though this may only for
           for the men in white hats.  In list context it returns all the names of  the  files/directories  that
           were  successfully  copied.   In  scalar  context it returns the number of successful copies made.  A
           directory argument is considerd a single successful copy if it manages to copy anything at  all.   To
           make a directory to directory copy the recursive flag must be set.

       <b>cp</b>  Just calls copy.  It's there to be compatible with File::Copy.

       <b>new</b> If used then you can treat this as an object oriented module with some configuration abilities.

       <b>recursive</b>
           If  used  as an object then you can use this to set the recursive attribute.  It can also be set when
           instantiating with new.  The other attributes must all be set when instantiating the object.   If  it
           isn't specified then directories are not followed.

       <b>preserve</b>
           Attempt  to preserve the last modification and access time as well as user and group id's.  This is a
           useful feature for sysadmins, though the access and modification time should always  be  preservable,
           the uid and gid may not.

       <b>follow_links</b>
           If  the  link  is  to  a  directory  and  this  attribute  is true then the directory is followed and
           recursively copied.  Otherwise a link is made to the root directory the link points to. eg.

           <a href="file:/sys/">/sys/</a> is a link to /usr/src/sys/ is a link to /usr/src/i386/sys  then  the  link  <a href="file:/sys/">/sys/</a>  is  actually
           created  in  the  source directory as a link to /usr/src/i386/sys/ rather than /usr/src/sys/ since if
           the link /usr/src/sys/ is removed then we lost the link  even  though  the  directory  we  originally
           intended to link to still exists.

       <b>force_write</b>
           Force the writing of a file even if the permissions are read only on it.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       See SYNOPSIS.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       When following links the target directory might not exactly the same as the source directory.  The reason
       is that we have to make sure we don't follow circular or dead links.  This is really a feature though the
       result may not quite resemble the source dir, the overall content will be the same. :)
