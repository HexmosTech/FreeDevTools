</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "Syntax::Operator::Is" - match operator using Data::Checks constraints

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       On Perl v5.38 or later:

          use v5.38;
          use Syntax::Operator::Is;

          use Data::Checks qw( Num Object );

          my $x = ...;

          if($x is Num) {
             say "x can be used as a number";
          }
          elsif($x is Object) {
             say "x can be used as an object";
          }

       Or via Syntax::Keyword::Match on Perl v5.14 or later:

          use v5.14;
          use Syntax::Operator::Is;
          use Syntax::Keyword::Match;

          use Data::Checks qw( Num Object );

          my $x = ...;

          match($x : is) {
             case(Num)    { say "x can be used as a number"; }
             case(Object) { say "x can be used as an object"; }
          }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides an infix operator that checks if a given value matches a value constraint provided
       by Data::Checks.

       Support for custom infix operators was added in the Perl 5.37.x development cycle and is available from
       development release v5.37.7 onwards, and therefore in Perl v5.38 onwards. The documentation of
       XS::Parse::Infix describes the situation in more detail.

       While Perl versions before this do not support custom infix operators, they can still be used via
       "XS::Parse::Infix" and hence XS::Parse::Keyword.  Custom keywords which attempt to parse operator syntax
       may be able to use these. One such module is Syntax::Keyword::Match; see the SYNOPSIS example given
       above.

   <b>Operator</b> <b>Name</b> <b>vs</b> <b>"Test::More"</b> <b>/</b> <b>"Test2::V0"</b>
       This module provides a named operator called "is". The same name is used by both Test::More and Test2::V0
       as a unit test assertion function. Since each has to be imported by request, this does not cause issues
       for code that does not try to use both of them at once. Most real use-cases will not be unit test
       scripts, and most unit test scripts will not need to use this operator.

       In situations where you need to use this "is" operator and one of the testing modules at the same time
       (for example, during a unit test of some check-related code), note that because of the way infix operator
       plugins work, the named operator will always take precedence and thus you will need to call the is()
       testing function by its fully-qualified name:

          use Test2::V0;
          use Syntax::Operator::Is;

          Test2::V0::is( 1 is Num, builtin::true, '1 is Num' );

       Alternatively, use the ability of XS::Parse::Infix to import the operator with a different name and avoid
       the collision.

          use Test2::V0;
          use Syntax::Operator::Is is =&gt; { -as =&gt; "is_checked" };

          is( 1 is_checked Num, builtin::true, '1 is Num' );

</pre><h4><b>OPERATORS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>is</b>
          my $ok = $value is $Constraint;

       Yields true if the given value is accepted by the given constraint checker.  Yields false but should not
       otherwise throw an exception if the value is rejected.
