</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PDL::Ops - Fundamental mathematical operators

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides the functions used by PDL to overload the basic mathematical operators ("+ - / *"
       etc.) and functions ("sin sqrt" etc.)

       It also includes the function "log10", which should be a perl function so that we can overload it!

       Matrix multiplication (the operator "x") is handled by the module PDL::Primitive.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       none

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>

   <b>assgn</b>
         Signature: (a(); [o]b())

       Plain numerical assignment. This is used to implement the ".=" operator

       If "a" is a child ndarray (e.g., the result of a slice) and bad values are generated in "b", the bad
       value flag is set in "b", but it is <b>NOT</b> automatically propagated back to the parent of "a".  The
       following idiom ensures that the badflag is propagated back to the parent of "a":

        $pdl-&gt;slice(":,(1)") .= PDL::Bad_aware_func();
        $pdl-&gt;<a href="../man1/badflag.1.html">badflag</a>(1);
        $pdl-&gt;check_badflag();

       This is unnecessary if $pdl-&gt;badflag is known to be 1 before the slice is performed.

       See <a href="http://pdl.perl.org/PDLdocs/BadValues.html">http://pdl.perl.org/PDLdocs/BadValues.html</a>#dataflow_of_the_badflag for details.

   <b>carg</b>
         Signature: (complexv(); real [o]b())

       Returns the polar angle of a complex number.

       carg processes bad values.  It will set the bad-value flag of all output ndarrays if the flag is set for
       any of the input ndarrays.

   <b>conj</b>
         Signature: (complexv();  [o]b())

       complex conjugate.

       conj processes bad values.  It will set the bad-value flag of all output ndarrays if the flag is set for
       any of the input ndarrays.

   <b>czip</b>
         Signature: (r(); i(); complex [o]c())

       convert real, imaginary to native complex, (sort of) like LISP zip function. Will add the "r" ndarray to
       "i" times the "i" ndarray. Only takes real ndarrays as input.

       czip does not process bad values.  It will set the bad-value flag of all output ndarrays if the flag is
       set for any of the input ndarrays.

   <b>ipow</b>
         Signature: (a(); indx b(); [o] ans())

       raise ndarray $a to integer power $b

          $c = $x-&gt;ipow($y,0);     # explicit function call
          $c = ipow $x, $y;
          $x-&gt;inplace-&gt;ipow($y,0);  # modify $x inplace

       It can be made to work inplace with the "$x-&gt;inplace" syntax.  Note that when calling this function
       explicitly you need to supply a third argument that should generally be zero (see first example).  This
       restriction is expected to go away in future releases.

       Algorithm from Wikipedia &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring</a>&gt;

       ipow does not process bad values.  It will set the bad-value flag of all output ndarrays if the flag is
       set for any of the input ndarrays.

   <b>abs</b>
       Returns the absolute value of a number.

   <b>abs2</b>
       Returns the square of the absolute value of a number.

   <b>r2C</b>
         Signature: (r(); complex [o]c())

       convert real to native complex, with an imaginary part of zero

       r2C does not process bad values.  It will set the bad-value flag of all output ndarrays if the flag is
       set for any of the input ndarrays.

   <b>i2C</b>
         Signature: (i(); complex [o]c())

       convert imaginary to native complex, with a real part of zero

       i2C does not process bad values.  It will set the bad-value flag of all output ndarrays if the flag is
       set for any of the input ndarrays.
