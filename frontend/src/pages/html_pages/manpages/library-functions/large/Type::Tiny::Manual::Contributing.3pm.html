</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Type::Tiny::Manual::Contributing - contributing to Type::Tiny development.

</pre><h4><b>MANUAL</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Reporting</b> <b>bugs</b>
       Bug reports (including wishlist items) can be submitted to GitHub.

       &lt;https://github.com/tobyink/p5-type-tiny/issues&gt;.

       Test cases written using Test::More are always appreciated.

   <b>Fixing</b> <b>bugs</b>
       If something doesn't work as documented, or causes unexpected crashes, and you know how to fix it, then
       either attach a patch to the bug report (see above) or as a pull request to the project on GitHub.

       &lt;https://github.com/tobyink/p5-type-tiny&gt;.

       Please try to follow the coding style used in the rest of the project.  (Tab indents, spaces for
       alignment, British English spellings, pod at the end of code but the start of test cases, etc.)

       &lt;https://github.com/tobyink/misc-development-tools/blob/master/bin/my-perltidy&gt;

   <b>Adding</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Cases</b>
       New test cases for the Type::Tiny test suite are always welcome.  The coveralls page for Type::Tiny
       should reveal what parts of the code are most needing good test cases. Any files with below 95% coverage
       are highest priority.

       &lt;https://coveralls.io/github/tobyink/p5-type-tiny&gt;.

       Type::Tiny is now also on Codecov which does coverage accounting slightly differently, giving some
       stricter targets to aim for.

       &lt;https://codecov.io/gh/tobyink/p5-type-tiny&gt;

   <b>Type::Tiny::XS</b>
       I'm not really a C programmer, nor am I that familiar with Perl's internals, so help with Type::Tiny::XS
       is always appreciated. There are some type constraints in Types::Standard, Types::Common::String, and
       Types::Common::Numeric which don't have XS implementations.

   <b>Writing</b> <b>Type</b> <b>Libraries</b>
       Though I'm unlikely to bundle many more type libraries in this distribution, uploading your own type
       libraries to CPAN will strengthen the Type::Tiny ecosystem.

   <b>Donate</b>
       If you or your organization uses Type::Tiny and you wish to contribute financially, you should be able to
       find links to donate on the Type::Tiny website at &lt;https://typetiny.toby.ink/&gt;.

       Please note that I am not suggesting that you must do this in order for me to continue working on
       Type::Tiny and related modules.

       You've reached the end of the manual!

       But each class, type library, and other package includes more detailed documentation.
