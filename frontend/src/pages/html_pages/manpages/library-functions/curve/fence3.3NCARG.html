</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       FENCE3 - Draws the projection of a curve, just as CURVE3 does, but with a "fence" of straight line
       segments that are parallel to one of the three axes and extend from the curve to a specified plane
       perpendicular to that axis.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL FENCE3 (U,V,W,N,IOREN,BOT)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_fence3 (float *u, float *v, float *w, int n,
       int ioren, float bot)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       U,V,W       (input  arrays,  dimensioned  at  least N, of type REAL) contain the U, V, and W coordinates,
                   respectively, of the points defining the curve whose projection is to be drawn.

       N           (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the number of points defining the curve.

       IOREN       (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the direction in which fence lines are to be  drawn,
                   as follows:

                   1  Parallel to the U axis.

                   2  Parallel to the V axis.

                   3  Parallel to the W axis.

       BOT         (an  input  expression  of type REAL) specifies where the bottom of the fence is to be drawn.
                   For example, if the fence lines are to be drawn parallel to the W-axis, and BOT=2., then  the
                   bottom of the fence would be the plane W=2.

                   The  word  "bottom"  may be misleading here; the entire curve might be below the plane of the
                   "bottom" and the fence might be horizontal, rather than vertical,  in  the  three-dimensional
                   space.

       The curve and the fence are drawn in the colors implied by the values of the variables ITHRMJ and ITHRMN,
       respectively, in the Threed COMMON block

                    COMMON /THRINT/ ITHRMJ,ITHRMN,ITHRTX

       The default value of both ITHRMJ and ITHRMN is 1; user code may change these values.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant example: fthex04.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use FENCE3 or c_fence3, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.
