</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Heap::Elem - Base class for elements in a Heap

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Heap::Elem::SomeInheritor;

         use Heap::SomeHeapClass;

         $elem = Heap::Elem::SomeInheritor-&gt;new( $value );
         $heap = Heap::SomeHeapClass-&gt;new;

         $heap-&gt;add($elem);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is an inheritable class for Heap Elements.  It provides the interface documentation and some
       inheritable methods.  Only a child classes can be used - this class is not complete.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $elem = Heap::Elem::SomeInheritor-&gt;new( [args] );
           Creates  a  new  Elem.   If there is exactly one arg, the Elem's value will be set to that value.  If
           there is more than one arg provided, the Elem's value will be set to an anonymous hash initialized to
           the provided args (which must have an even number, of course).

       $elem-&gt;heap( $val ); $elem-&gt;heap;
           Provides a method for use by the Heap processing routines.  If a value argument is provided, it  will
           be  saved.   The new saved value is always returned.  If no value argument is provided, the old saved
           value is returned.

           The Heap processing routines use this method to map an element into its internal structure.  This  is
           needed  to  support  the  Heap  methods  that  affect elements that are not are the top of the heap -
           <u>decrease_key</u> and <u>delete</u>.

           The Heap processing routines will ensure that this value is undef when this elem is  removed  from  a
           heap,  and  is  not undef after it is inserted into a heap.  This means that you can check whether an
           element is currently contained within a heap or not.  (It cannot be used to determine which  heap  an
           element  is  contained  in, if you have multiple heaps.  Keeping that information accurate would make
           the operation of merging two heaps into a single one take longer - it would have to traverse  all  of
           the  elements  in the merged heap to update them; for Binomial and Fibonacci heaps that would turn an
           <a href="../man1/O.1.html">O</a>(1) operation into an O(n) one.)

       $elem-&gt;val( $val ); $elem-&gt;val;
           Provides a method to get and/or set the value of the element.

       $elem1-&gt;cmp($elem2)
           A routine to compare two elements.  It must return a negative value if this element should go  higher
           on  the heap than <u>$elem2</u>, 0 if they are equal, or a positive value if this element should go lower on
           the heap than <u>$elem2</u>.  Just as with sort, the Perl operators &lt;=&gt; and cmp cause the smaller  value  to
           be  returned  first;  similarly you can negate the meaning to reverse the order - causing the heap to
           always return the largest element instead of the smallest.

</pre><h4><b>INHERITING</b></h4><pre>
       This class can be inherited to provide an object with the  ability  to  be  heaped.   If  the  object  is
       implemented  as  a  hash, and if it can deal with a key of <u>heap</u>, leaving it unchanged for use by the heap
       routines, then the following implemetation will work.

         package myObject;

         require Exporter;

         @ISA = qw(Heap::Elem);

         sub new {
             my $self = shift;
             my $class = ref($self) || $self;

             my $self = SUPER::new($class);

             # set $self-&gt;{key} = $value;
         }

         sub cmp {
             my $self = shift;
             my $other = shift;

             $self-&gt;{key} cmp $other-&gt;{key};
         }

         # other methods for the rest of myObject's functionality
