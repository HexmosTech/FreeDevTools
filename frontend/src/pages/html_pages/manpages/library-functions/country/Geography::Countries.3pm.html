</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Geography::Countries - 2-letter, 3-letter, and numerical codes for countries.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Geography::Countries;

           $country = country 'DE';  # 'Germany'
           @list    = country  666;  # ('PM', 'SPM', 666,
                                     #  'Saint Pierre and Miquelon', 1)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module maps country names, and their 2-letter, 3-letter and numerical codes, as defined by the
       ISO-3166 maintenance agency [1], and defined by the UNSD.

   <b>The</b> <b>"country"</b> <b>subroutine.</b>
       This subroutine is exported by default. It takes a 2-letter, 3-letter or numerical code, or a country
       name as argument. In scalar context, it will return the country name, in list context, it will return a
       list consisting of the 2-letter code, the 3-letter code, the numerical code, the country name, and a
       flag, which is explained below. Note that not all countries have all 3 codes; if a code is unknown, the
       undefined value is returned.

       There are 3 categories of countries. The largest category are the current countries. Then there is a
       small set of countries that no longer exist. The final set consists of areas consisting of multiple
       countries, like <u>Africa</u>. No 2-letter or 3-letter codes are available for the second two sets. (ISO 3166-3
       [3] defines 4 letter codes for the set of countries that no longer exist, but the author of this module
       was unable to get her hands on that standard.) By default, "country" only returns countries from the
       first set, but this can be changed by giving "country" an optional second argument.

       The module optionally exports the constants "CNT_F_REGULAR", "CNT_F_OLD", "CNT_F_REGION" and "CNT_F_ANY".
       These constants can also be important all at once by using the tag ":FLAGS". "CNT_F_ANY" is just the
       binary or of the three other flags. The second argument of "country" should be the binary or of a subset
       of the flags "CNT_F_REGULAR", "CNT_F_OLD", and "CNT_F_REGION" - if no, or a false, second argument is
       given, "CNT_F_REGULAR" is assumed. If "CNT_F_REGULAR" is set, regular (current) countries will be
       returned; if "CNT_F_OLD" is set, old, no longer existing, countries will be returned, while
       "CNT_F_REGION" is used in case a region (not necessarely) a country might be returned.  If "country" is
       used in list context, the fifth returned element is one of "CNT_F_REGULAR", "CNT_F_OLD" and
       "CNT_F_REGION", indicating whether the result is a regular country, an old country, or a region.

       In list context, "country" returns a 5 element list. To avoid having to remember which element is in
       which index, the constants "CNT_I_CODE2", "CNT_I_CODE3", "CNT_I_NUMCODE", "CNT_I_COUNTRY" and
       "CNT_I_FLAG" can be imported. Those constants contain the indices of the 2-letter code, the 3-letter
       code, the numerical code, the country, and the flag explained above, respectively. All index constants
       can be imported by using the ":INDICES" tag.

   <b>The</b> <b>"code2",</b> <b>"code3",</b> <b>"numcode"</b> <b>and</b> <b>"countries"</b> <b>routines.</b>
       All known 2-letter codes, 3-letter codes, numerical codes and country names can be returned by the
       routines "code2", "code3", "numcode" and "countries". None of these methods is exported by default; all
       need to be imported if one wants to use them. The tag ":LISTS" imports them all. In scalar context, the
       number of known codes or countries is returned.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       The 2-letter codes come from the ISO 3166-1:1997 standard [2]. ISO 3166 bases its list of country names
       on the list of names published by the United Nations. This list is published by the Statistical Division
       of the United Nations [4]. The UNSD uses 3-letter codes, and numerical codes [5]. The information about
       old countries [6] and regions [7] also comes from the United Nations.

       In a few cases, there was a conflict between the way how the United Nations spelled a name, and how ISO
       3166 spells it. In most cases, is was word order (for instance whether <u>The</u> <u>republic</u> <u>of</u> should preceed the
       name, or come after the name. A few cases had minor spelling variations. In all such cases, the method in
       which the UN spelled the name was choosen; ISO 3166 claims to take the names from the UN, so we consider
       the UN authoritative.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Looking  up information using country names is far from perfect.  Except for case and the amount of white
       space, the exact name as it appears on the list has to be given. <u>USA</u> will not return anything, but <u>United</u>
       <u>States</u> will.
