</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Finance::Quote::MorningstarUK - Obtain UK Unit Trust quotes from morningstar.co.uk.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           $q = Finance::Quote-&gt;new;

           %info = $q-&gt;fetch("mstaruk","&lt;isin&gt; ...");  # Only query morningstar.co.uk using ISINs
           %info = $q-&gt;fetch("ukfunds","&lt;isin&gt; ...");  # Failover to other sources

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module fetches information from the MorningStar Funds service, <a href="http://morningstar.com/uk/">http://morningstar.com/uk/</a>. There are
       many UK Unit Trusts and OEICs quoted, as well as many Offshore Funds and Exhange Traded Funds (ETFs). It
       converts any funds quoted in GBX (pence) to GBP, dividing the price by 100 in the process.

       Funds are identified by their ISIN code.

       This module is loaded by default on a Finance::Quote object. It's also possible to load it explicitly by
       placing "mstaruk" in the argument list to Finance::Quote-&gt;<b>new()</b>.

       Information obtained by this module may be covered by funds.ft.com terms and conditions See
       <a href="http://morningstar.co.ukfor">http://morningstar.co.ukfor</a> details.

   <b>Stocks</b> <b>And</b> <b>Indices</b>
       This module provides both the "mstaruk" and "ukfunds" fetch methods for fetching UK and Offshore Unit
       Trusts and OEICs prices and other information from funds.ft.com. Please use the "ukfunds" fetch method if
       you wish to have failover with future sources for UK and Offshore Unit Trusts and OEICs - the author has
       plans to develop Finance::Quote modules for other source providing unit trust prices. Using the "mstaruk"
       method will guarantee that your information only comes from the morningstar.co.uk website.
