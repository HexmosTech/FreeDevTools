</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Search::Xapian::MatchSpy - abstract base class for match spies.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is an abstract base class for match spies in Xapian.

       The subclasses will generally accumulate information seen during the match, to calculate aggregate
       functions, or other profiles of the matching documents.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>operator()</b> &lt;Document&gt; &lt;weight&gt;
           Virtual - needs to be implemented in extending classes. Registers a document with the match spy.

           This  is  called by the matcher once with each document seen by the matcher during the match process.
           Note that the matcher  will  often  not  see  all  the  documents  which  match  the  query,  due  to
           optimisations  which  allow  low-weighted  documents to be skipped, and allow the match process to be
           terminated early.

       get_description
           Return a string describing this object.

           This default implementation returns a generic answer, to  avoid  forcing  those  deriving  their  own
           MatchSpy subclasses from having to implement this (they may not care what <b>get_description()</b> gives for
           their subclass).

           Reimplemented in Xapian::ValueCountMatchSpy.

       name
           Return the name of this match spy.

           This  name  is  used by the remote backend. It is passed with the serialised parameters to the remote
           server so that it knows which class to create. Return the full namespace-qualified name of your class
           here. If you don't want to support the remote backend in your match spy,  you  can  use  the  default
           implementation which simply throws Xapian::UnimplementedError.

           Reimplemented in Xapian::ValueCountMatchSpy.
