       match::simple - simplified clone of smartmatch operator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use v5.10;
          use match::simple;

          if ( $this |M| $that ) {
             say "$this matches $that";
          }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       match::simple provides a simple match operator "|M|" that acts like a sane subset of the (as of Perl
       5.18) deprecated smart match operator.  Unlike smart match, the behaviour of the match is determined
       entirely by the operand on the right hand side.

       •   If the right hand side is "undef", then there is only a match if the left hand side is also "undef".

       •   If the right hand side is a non-reference, then the match is a simple string match.

       •   If the right hand side is a reference to a regexp, then the left hand is evaluated .

       •   If the right hand side is a code reference, then it is called in a boolean context with the left hand
           side being passed as an argument.

       •   If  the  right  hand  side  is an object which provides a "MATCH" method, then it this is called as a
           method, with the left hand side being passed as an argument.

       •   If the right hand side is an object which overloads "~~", then this will be used.

       •   If the right hand side is an arrayref, then the operator recurses into  the  array,  with  the  match
           succeeding if the left hand side matches any array element.

       •   If any other value appears on the right hand side, the operator will croak.

       If you don't like the crazy Sub::Infix operator, you can alternatively export a more normal function:

          use v5.10;
          use match::simple <a href="../manmatch/qw.match.html">qw</a>(match);

          if ( match($this, $that) ) {
             say "$this matches $that";
          }

       If  you're  making  heavy  use  of  this  module,  then  this  is  probably  your best option, as it runs
       significantly faster.

   <b>XS</b> <b>Backend</b>
       If you install match::simple::XS, a faster XS-based implementation will be used instead of the pure  Perl
       functions.  Depending  on what sort of match you are doing, this is likely to be several times faster. In
       extreme cases, such as matching a string in an arrayref, it can be twenty-five  times  faster,  or  more.
       However, where $that is a single regexp, it's around 30% slower.  Overall though, I think the performance
       improvement is worthwhile.

       If  you want to take advantage of this speed up, use the "match" function rather than the "|M|" operator.
       Otherwise all your gains will be lost to the slow implementation of operator overloading.

       The constant "match::simple::IMPLEMENTATION" tells you which backend is currently in use.

   <b>Environment</b>
       Setting the "MATCH_SIMPLE_IMPLEMENTATION" environment variable to "PP" encourages  match::simple  to  use
       the pure Perl backend.
