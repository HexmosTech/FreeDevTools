</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>tk</b>  <b>busy</b>  command  provides  a  simple  means  to  block mouse pointer events from Tk widgets, while
       overriding the widget's cursor with a configurable busy  cursor.  Note  this  command  does  not  prevent
       keyboard events from being sent to the widgets made busy.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  many  times  in applications where you want to temporarily restrict what actions the user can
       take. For example, an application could have a “Run” button that when pressed causes some  processing  to
       occur.  However, while the application is busy processing, you probably don't want the user to be able to
       click the “Run” button again. You may also want restrict the user from other tasks  such  as  clicking  a
       “Print” button.

       The  <b>tk</b>  <b>busy</b>  command  lets  you  make Tk widgets busy. This means that user interactions such as button
       clicks, moving the mouse, typing at the keyboard, etc. are ignored by the widget. You can set  a  special
       cursor  (like a watch) that overrides the widget's normal cursor, providing feedback that the application
       (widget) is temporarily busy.

       When a widget is made busy, the widget and all of its descendants will ignore pointer events.  It's  easy
       to  make  an  entire  panel of widgets busy. You can simply make the toplevel widget (such as “.”)  busy.
       This is easier and far much more efficient than recursively traversing the  widget  hierarchy,  disabling
       each widget and re-configuring its cursor.

       Often, the <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> command can be used instead of Tk's <b>grab</b> command. Unlike <b>grab</b> which restricts all user
       interactions  to  one  widget,  with  the  <b>tk</b>  <b>busy</b> command you can have more than one widget active (for
       example, a “Cancel” dialog and a “Help” button).

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       You can make several widgets busy by simply making its ancestor widget busy using the <b>hold</b> operation.

              frame .top
              button .top.button; canvas .top.canvas
              pack .top.button .top.canvas
              pack .top
              # . . .
              <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> hold .top
              update

       All the widgets within <b>.top</b> (including <b>.top</b>) are now busy. Using <b>update</b> insures that <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> command will
       take effect before any other user events can occur.

       When the application is no longer busy processing, you can allow user interactions  again  and  free  any
       resources it allocated by the <b>forget</b> operation.

              <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> forget .top

       The busy window has a configurable cursor. You can change the busy cursor using the <b>configure</b> operation.

              <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> configure .top -cursor "watch"

       Destroying the widget will also clean up any resources allocated by the <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operations are available for the <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> command:

       <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Shortcut for <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> <b>hold</b> command.

       <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> <b>busywindow</b> <u>window</u>
              Returns  the  pathname  of  the  busy  window  (i.e.  the  transparent window shielding the window
              appearing busy) created by the <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> <b>hold</b> command for <u>window</u>, or the empty string if  <u>window</u>  is
              not busy.

       <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> <b>cget</b> <u>window</u> <u>option</u>
              Queries  the  <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> command configuration options for <u>window</u>.  <u>Window</u> must be the path name of a
              widget previously made busy by the <b>hold</b> operation. The command returns the present  value  of  the
              specified <u>option</u>. <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the <b>hold</b> operation.

       <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> <b>configure</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Queries  or modifies the <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> command configuration options for <u>window</u>. <u>Window</u> must be the path
              name of a widget previously made busy by the <b>hold</b> operation.  If no options are specified, a  list
              describing  all  of  the available options for <u>window</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on the
              format of this list) is returned. If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a
              list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist  of
              the  value  returned  if no <u>option</u> is specified). If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified,
              then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case  the
              command  returns  the  empty  string.  <u>Option</u>  may  have  any  of  the values accepted by the <b>hold</b>
              operation.

              Please note that the option database is referenced through <u>window</u>.  For  example,  if  the  widget
              <b>.frame</b> is to be made busy, the busy cursor can be specified for it by either <b>option</b> command:

                     option add *frame.busyCursor gumby
                     option add *Frame.BusyCursor gumby

       <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> <b>current</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              Returns the pathnames of all widgets that are currently busy. If a <u>pattern</u> is given, only the path
              names of busy widgets matching <u>pattern</u> are returned.

       <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> <b>forget</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>window</u>?...
              Releases  resources allocated by the <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> command for <u>window</u>, including the transparent window.
              User events will again be  received  by  <u>window</u>.  Resources  are  also  released  when  <u>window</u>  is
              destroyed.   <u>Window</u>  must  be  the  name of a widget specified in the <b>hold</b> operation, otherwise an
              error is reported.

       <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> <b>hold</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Makes the specified <u>window</u> (and its descendants in the Tk window hierarchy)  appear  busy.  <u>Window</u>
              must  be  a valid path name of a Tk widget.  A transparent window is put in front of the specified
              window. This transparent window is mapped  the  next  time  idle  tasks  are  processed,  and  the
              specified  window  and  its  descendants  will  be blocked from user interactions. Normally <b>update</b>
              should be called immediately afterward to insure that the hold operation is in effect  before  the
              application  starts  its  processing. The command returns the pathname of the busy window that was
              created (i.e.  the  transparent  window  shielding  the  window  appearing  busy).  The  following
              configuration options are valid:

              <b>-cursor</b> <u>cursorName</u>
                     Specifies  the  cursor  to be displayed when the widget is made busy.  <u>CursorName</u> can be in
                     any form accepted by <b>Tk_GetCursor</b>. The default cursor is <b>wait</b> on Windows and <b>watch</b> on other
                     platforms.

       <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> <b>status</b> <u>window</u>
              Returns the status of a widget <u>window</u>. If <u>window</u> presently can not receive user interactions, <b>1</b> is
              returned, otherwise <b>0</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
   <b>BINDINGS</b>
       The event blocking feature is implemented by creating and mapping a transparent  window  that  completely
       covers the widget. When the busy window is mapped, it invisibly shields the widget and its hierarchy from
       all  events that may be sent. Like Tk widgets, busy windows have widget names in the Tk window hierarchy.
       This means that you can use the <b>bind</b> command to handle events in the busy window:

              <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> hold .frame.canvas
              bind [<b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> busywindow .frame.canvas] &lt;Enter&gt; { ... }

       or
              set busyWin [<b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> hold .frame.canvas]
              bind $busyWin &lt;Enter&gt; { ... }

   <b>ENTER/LEAVE</b> <b>EVENTS</b>
       Mapping and unmapping busy windows generates Enter/Leave events for all widgets they cover.  Please  note
       this if you are tracking Enter/Leave events in widgets.

   <b>KEYBOARD</b> <b>EVENTS</b>
       When a widget is made busy, the widget is prevented from gaining the keyboard focus by a user clicking on
       it  by  the  busy  window. But if the widget already had focus, it still may receive keyboard events. The
       widget can also still receive focus through keyboard traversal. To prevent this, you must move  focus  to
       another  window  and  make  sure the focus can not go back to the widgets made busy (e.g. but restricting
       focus to a cancel button).

              pack [frame .frame]
              pack [text .frame.text]
              <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> hold .frame
              pack [button .cancel -text "Cancel" -command exit]
              focus .cancel
              bind .cancel &lt;Tab&gt; {break}
              bind .cancel &lt;Shift-Tab&gt; {break}
              update

       The above example moves the focus from .frame immediately after invoking the <b>hold</b>  so  that  no  keyboard
       events  will  be  sent to <b>.frame</b> or any of its descendants. It also makes sure it's not possible to leave
       button <b>.cancel</b> using the keyboard.

</pre><h4><b>PORTABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Note that the <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> command does not currently have any effect on macOS when Tk  is  built  using  Aqua
       support.
