</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>busy</b>  command provides a simple means to block keyboard, button, and pointer events from Tk widgets,
       while overriding the widget's cursor with a configurable busy cursor.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       There are many times in applications where you want to temporarily restrict what  actions  the  user  can
       take.   For example, an application could have a "run" button that when pressed causes some processing to
       occur.  But while the application is busy processing, you probably don't want the the user to be able  to
       click  the  "run"  button again.  You may also want restrict the user from other tasks such as clicking a
       "print" button.

       The <b>busy</b> command lets you make Tk widgets busy. This means that user interactions such as button  clicks,
       moving  the  mouse, typing at the keyboard, etc. are ignored by the widget.  You can set a special cursor
       (like a watch) that overrides the  widget's  normal  cursor,  providing  feedback  that  the  application
       (widget) is temporarily busy.

       When  a widget is made busy, the widget and all of its descendents will ignore events.  It's easy to make
       an entire panel of widgets busy. You can simply make the toplevel widget (such as  ".")  busy.   This  is
       easier  and  far  much  more  efficient  than recursively traversing the widget hierarchy, disabling each
       widget and re-configuring its cursor.

       Often, the busy command can be used instead of Tk's <b>grab</b> command.  Unlike <b>grab</b> which restricts  all  user
       interactions  to one widget, with the busy command you can have more than one widget active (for example,
       a "cancel" dialog and a "help" button).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       You can make several widgets busy by simply making its ancestor widget busy using the <b>hold</b> operation.

              frame .top
              button .top.button; canvas .top.canvas
              pack .top.button .top.canvas
              pack .top
                . . .
              busy hold .top
              update

       All the widgets within <b>.top</b> (including <b>.top</b>) are now busy.  Using <b>update</b> insures that <b>busy</b>  command  will
       take effect before any other user events can occur.

       When  the  application is no longer busy processing, you can allow user interactions again by the <b>release</b>
       operation.

         <b>busy</b> <b>release</b> <b>.top</b>

       The busy window has a configurable cursor.  You can change the busy cursor using the <b>configure</b> operation.

         <b>busy</b> <b>configure</b> <b>.top</b> <b>-cursor</b> <b>"watch"</b>

       Finally, when you no longer need to the busy window, invoke the <b>forget</b> operation to free any resources it
       allocated.

         <b>busy</b> <b>forget</b> <b>.top</b>

       Destroying the widget will also clean up any resources allocated by the busy command.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operations are available for the <b>busy</b> command:

       <b>busy</b> <b>hold</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Makes the widget <u>window</u> (and its descendants in the Tk window hierarchy) busy.  <u>Window</u> must  be  a
              valid path name of a Tk widget.  The busy window is mapped the next time idle tasks are processed,
              and  the  widget  and  its  descendants  will be blocked from user interactions. All events in the
              widget window and its descendants are ignored.   Normally  <b>update</b>  should  be  called  immediately
              afterward  to  insure  that  the  <b>hold</b>  operation  is  in effect <u>before</u> the application starts its
              processing. The following configuration options are valid:

              <b>-cursor</b> <u>cursorName</u>
                     Specifies the cursor to be displayed when the widget is made busy.  <u>CursorName</u>  can  be  in
                     any form accepted by <b>Tk_GetCursor</b>.  The default cursor is <b>watch</b>.

       <b>busy</b> <b>configure</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Queries  or  modifies  the  <b>busy</b> command configuration options for <u>window</u>. <u>Window</u> must be the path
              name of a widget previously made busy by the <b>hold</b> operation.  If no options are specified, a  list
              describing  all  of  the available options for <u>window</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on the
              format of this list) is returned.  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command  returns
              a  list  describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist
              of the value returned if no  <u>option</u>  is  specified).   If  one  or  more  <u>option-value</u>  pairs  are
              specified,  then  the  command  modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in
              this case the command returns the empty string.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the
              <b>hold</b> operation.

              Please note that the option database is referenced through <u>window</u>.  For  example,  if  the  widget
              <b>.frame</b> is to be made busy, the busy cursor can be specified for it by either <b>option</b> command:

                <b>option</b> <b>add</b> <b>*frame.busyCursor</b> <b>gumby</b>
                <b>option</b> <b>add</b> <b>*Frame.BusyCursor</b> <b>gumby</b>

       <b>busy</b> <b>forget</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>window</u>?...
              Releases  resources  allocated  by  the  busy command for <u>window</u>, including the busy window.  User
              events will again be received again by  <u>window</u>.   Resources  are  also  released  when  <u>window</u>  is
              destroyed. <u>Window</u> must be the name of a widget specified in the <b>hold</b> operation, otherwise an error
              is reported.

       <b>busy</b> <b>isbusy</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              Returns  the  pathnames  of  all widgets that are currently busy.  If a <u>pattern</u> is given, the path
              names of busy widgets matching <u>pattern</u> are returned.

       <b>busy</b> <b>names</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              Returns the pathnames of all widgets that have previously been made busy (i.e. a  busy  window  is
              allocated and associated with the widget).  It makes no difference if the window is currently busy
              or not.  If a <u>pattern</u> is given, the path names of busy widgets matching <u>pattern</u> are returned.

       <b>busy</b> <b>release</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>window</u>?...
              Restores  user interactions to the widget <u>window</u> again.  This differs from the <b>forget</b> operation in
              that the busy window is not destroyed, but simply unmapped.  <u>Window</u> must be the name of  a  widget
              specified in a <b>hold</b> operation, otherwise an error is reported.

       <b>busy</b> <b>status</b> <u>window</u>
              Returns  the  status  of a widget <u>window</u> previously made busy.  An error is reported if <u>window</u> was
              never made busy, or the <b>forget</b> operation was invoked (i.e. does not currently have a  busy  window
              associated  with  it).   If  <u>window</u> is presently can not receive user interactions, <b>1</b> is returned,
              otherwise <b>0</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The event blocking feature is implemented by creating and mapping a transparent  window  that  completely
       covers  the  widget.   When  the busy window is mapped, it invisibly shields the widget and its hierarchy
       from all events that may be sent.  Like Tk widgets, busy windows have  widget  names  in  the  Tk  window
       hierarchy.  This means that you can use the <b>bind</b> command, to handle events in the busy window.

              busy hold .frame.canvas
              bind .frame.canvas_Busy &lt;Enter&gt; { ... }

       Normally  the busy window is a sibling of the widget.  The name of the busy window is "<u>widget</u><b>_Busy</b>" where
       <u>widget</u> is the name of the widget to be made busy.  In the previous example,  the  pathname  of  the  busy
       window is "<b>.frame.canvas_Busy</b>" The exception is when the widget is a toplevel widget (such as ".")  where
       the  busy  window  can't  be  made  a  sibling.   The  busy  window  is  then a child of the widget named
       "<u>widget</u><b>._Busy</b>" where <u>widget</u> is the name of the toplevel widget.  In the following example,  the  pathname
       of the busy window is "<b>._Busy</b>"

              busy hold .
              bind ._Busy &lt;Enter&gt; { ... }

</pre><h4><b>ENTER/LEAVE</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Mapping  and unmapping busy windows generates Enter/Leave events for all widgets they cover.  Please note
       this if you are tracking Enter/Leave events in widgets.

</pre><h4><b>KEYBOARD</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       When a widget is made busy, the widget is prevented from gaining the keyboard focus by the  busy  window.
       But  if  the  widget already had focus, it still may received keyboard events.  To prevent this, you must
       move focus to another window.

              busy hold .frame
              label .dummy
              focus .dummy
              update

       The above example moves the focus from .frame immediately after invoking the <b>hold</b>  so  that  no  keyboard
       events will be sent to <b>.frame</b> or any of its descendants.

</pre><h4><b>KEYWORDS</b></h4><pre>
       busy, keyboard events, pointer events, window, cursor
