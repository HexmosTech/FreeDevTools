       Tk::Toplevel - Create and manipulate Toplevel widgets

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           <u>$toplevel</u> = <u>$parent</u>-&gt;<b>Toplevel</b>(?<u>options</u>?);

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-borderwidth</b>   <b>-highlightbackground</b>     <b>-highlightthickness</b> <b>-takefocus</b>
       <b>-class</b>    <b>-highlightcolor</b>     <b>-relief</b> <b>-cursor</b>

       See Tk::options for details of the standard options.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Name:     <b>background</b>
       Class:    <b>Background</b>
       Switch:   <b>-background</b>
           This option is the same as the standard <b>background</b> option except that its value may also be specified
           as  an undefined value.  In this case, the widget will display no background or border, and no colors
           will be consumed from its colormap for its background and border.

       Name:     <b>colormap</b>
       Class:    <b>Colormap</b>
       Switch:   <b>-colormap</b>
           Specifies a colormap to use for the window.  The value may  be  either  <b>new</b>,  in  which  case  a  new
           colormap  is created for the window and its children, or the name of another window (which must be on
           the same screen and have the same visual as $widget), in which case  the  new  window  will  use  the
           colormap from the specified window.  If the <b>colormap</b> option is not specified, the new window uses the
           default colormap of its screen.  This option may not be changed with the <b>configure</b> method.

       Name:     <b>container</b>
       Class:    <b>Container</b>
       Switch:   <b>-container</b>
           The value must be a boolean.  If true, it means that this window will be used as a container in which
           some  other  application  will be embedded (for example, a Tk toplevel can be embedded using the <b>-use</b>
           option).  The window will support the appropriate window manager protocols for things  like  geometry
           requests.   The  window should not have any children of its own in this application.  This option may
           not be changed with the <b>configure</b> method.

       Name:     <b>height</b>
       Class:    <b>Height</b>
       Switch:   <b>-height</b>
           Specifies the desired height for the window in any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  If  this
           option is less than or equal to zero then the window will not request any size at all.

       Name:     <b>menu</b>
       Class:    <b>Menu</b>
       Switch:   <b>-menu</b>
           Specifies  a  menu  widget  to  be used as a menubar. On the Macintosh, the menubar will be displayed
           accross the top of the main monitor. On Microsoft Windows and  all  UNIX  platforms,  the  menu  will
           appear accross the toplevel window as part of the window dressing maintained by the window manager.

       Name:     <b>""</b>
       Class:    <b>""</b>
       Switch:   <b>-screen</b>
           Specifies  the  screen on which to place the new window.  Any valid screen name may be used, even one
           associated with a different display.  Defaults to the same screen as  its  parent.   This  option  is
           special  in that it may not be specified via the option database, and it may not be modified with the
           <b>configure</b> method.

       Switch:   <b>-title</b>
           Specifies the title of the toplevel window.

       Name:     <b>use</b>
       Class:    <b>Use</b>
       Switch:   <b>-use</b>
           This option is used for embedding. If the value isn't an empty string, it  must  be  the  the  window
           identifier  of  a  container  window, specified as a hexadecimal string like the ones returned by the
           <b>winfo</b> <b>id</b> command. The toplevel widget will be created as a child of the given  container  instead  of
           the  root  window for the screen.  If the container window is in a Tk application, it must be a frame
           or toplevel widget for which the <b>-container</b> option was specified.  This option  may  not  be  changed
           with the <b>configure</b> method.

       Name:     <b>visual</b>
       Class:    <b>Visual</b>
       Switch:   <b>-visual</b>
           Specifies  visual  information  for  the new window in any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetVisual</b>.  If
           this option is not specified, the new window will use the default visual for its screen.  The  <b>visual</b>
           option may not be modified with the <b>configure</b> method.

       Name:     <b>width</b>
       Class:    <b>Width</b>
       Switch:   <b>-width</b>
           Specifies  the  desired width for the window in any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  If this
           option is less than or equal to zero then the window will not request any size at all.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Toplevel</b> method creates a new toplevel widget (given by the $widget argument).   Additional  options,
       described  above,  may be specified on the command line or in the option database to configure aspects of
       the toplevel such as its background color and relief.  The <b>toplevel</b> command returns the path name of  the
       new window.

       A  toplevel  is  similar to a frame except that it is created as a top-level window:  its X parent is the
       root window of a screen rather than the logical parent from its path name.   The  primary  purpose  of  a
       toplevel  is to serve as a container for dialog boxes and other collections of widgets.  The only visible
       features of a toplevel are its background color and an optional 3-D border to make  the  toplevel  appear
       raised or sunken.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>Toplevel</b>  method  creates  a  widget  object.   This  object supports the <b>configure</b> and <b>cget</b> methods
       described in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify the options described above.  The widget
       also inherits all the methods provided by the generic Tk::Widget class, and the Tk::Wm class.

</pre><h4><b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       When a new toplevel is created, it has no default event  bindings:  toplevels  are  not  intended  to  be
       interactive.
