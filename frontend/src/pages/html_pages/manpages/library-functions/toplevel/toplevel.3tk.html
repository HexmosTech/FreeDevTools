</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-borderwidth</b>          <b>-highlightcolor</b>      <b>-pady</b>
       <b>-cursor</b>               <b>-highlightthickness</b>  <b>-relief</b>
       <b>-highlightbackground</b>  <b>-padx</b>                <b>-takefocus</b>

       See the <b>options</b> manual entry for details on the standard options.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Command-Line Name:<b>-background</b>
       Database Name:  <b>background</b>
       Database Class: <b>Background</b>

              This  option  is  the  same  as  the standard <b>-background</b> option except that its value may also be
              specified as an empty string.  In this case, the widget will display no background or border,  and
              no  colors  will be consumed from its colormap for its background and border.  An empty background 2
              will disable drawing the background image.                                                         2

       Command-Line Name:<b>-backgroundimage</b>                                                                        2
       Database Name:  <b>backgroundImage</b>                                                                           2
       Database Class: <b>BackgroundImage</b>                                                                           2

              This specifies an image to display on the toplevel's background within the border of the  toplevel 2
              (i.e.,  the  image  will  be  clipped  by  the toplevel's highlight ring and border, if either are 2
              present) on top of the background; subwidgets of the toplevel will be drawn on top. The image must 2
              have been created with the <b>image</b> <b>create</b> command. If specified as the empty string, no  image  will 2
              be displayed.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-class</b>
       Database Name:  <b>class</b>
       Database Class: <b>Class</b>

              Specifies  a  class for the window.  This class will be used when querying the option database for
              the window's other options, and it will also be used later for other purposes  such  as  bindings.
              Some  window  managers  display the class name for windows in their dock while some others display
              the window title.  The <b>-class</b> option may not be changed with the <b>configure</b> widget command.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-colormap</b>
       Database Name:  <b>colormap</b>
       Database Class: <b>Colormap</b>

              Specifies a colormap to use for the window.  The value may be either <b>new</b>,  in  which  case  a  new
              colormap  is created for the window and its children, or the name of another window (which must be
              on the same screen and have the same visual as <u>pathName</u>), in which case the new  window  will  use
              the  colormap from the specified window.  If the <b>-colormap</b> option is not specified, the new window
              uses the default colormap of its screen.  This option may not be changed with the <b>configure</b> widget
              command.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-container</b>
       Database Name:  <b>container</b>
       Database Class: <b>Container</b>

              The value must be a boolean.  If true, it means that this window will be used as  a  container  in
              which  some  other  application will be embedded (for example, a Tk toplevel can be embedded using
              the <b>-use</b> option).  The window will support the appropriate window  manager  protocols  for  things
              like  geometry  requests.  The window should not have any children of its own in this application.
              This option may not be changed with the <b>configure</b> widget command.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-height</b>
       Database Name:  <b>height</b>
       Database Class: <b>Height</b>

              Specifies the desired height for the window in any of the forms acceptable  to  <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.   If
              this option is negative or zero then the window will not request any size at all.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-menu</b>
       Database Name:  <b>menu</b>
       Database Class: <b>Menu</b>

              Specifies  a  menu widget to be used as a menubar. On the Macintosh, the menubar will be displayed
              across the top of the main monitor. On Microsoft Windows and all UNIX  platforms,  the  menu  will
              appear across the toplevel window as part of the window dressing maintained by the window manager.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-screen</b>
       Database Name:
       Database Class:

              Specifies  the  screen  on which to place the new window.  Any valid screen name may be used, even
              one associated with a different display.  Defaults to the same screen as its parent.  This  option
              is  special  in  that  it may not be specified via the option database, and it may not be modified
              with the <b>configure</b> widget command.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-tile</b>
       Database Name:  <b>tile</b>
       Database Class: <b>Tile</b>

              This specifies how to draw the background image (see <b>-backgroundimage</b>) on the toplevel.   If  true 2
              (according to <b>Tcl_GetBoolean</b>), the image will be tiled to fill the whole toplevel, with the origin 2
              of  the first copy of the image being the top left of the interior of the toplevel.  If false (the 2
              default), the image will be centered within the toplevel.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-use</b>
       Database Name:  <b>use</b>
       Database Class: <b>Use</b>

              This option is used for embedding. If the value is not an empty string,  it  must  be  the  window
              identifier  of a container window, specified as a hexadecimal string like the ones returned by the
              <b>winfo</b> <b>id</b> command. The toplevel widget will be created as a child of the given container instead of
              the root window for the screen.  If the container window is in a Tk  application,  it  must  be  a
              frame  or  toplevel  widget for which the <b>-container</b> option was specified.  This option may not be
              changed with the <b>configure</b> widget command.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-visual</b>
       Database Name:  <b>visual</b>
       Database Class: <b>Visual</b>

              Specifies visual information for the new window in any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetVisual</b>.   If
              this  option  is  not  specified,  the new window will use the default visual for its screen.  The
              <b>-visual</b> option may not be modified with the <b>configure</b> widget command.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-width</b>
       Database Name:  <b>width</b>
       Database Class: <b>Width</b>

              Specifies the desired width for the window in any of the forms  acceptable  to  <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.   If
              this option is negative or zero then the window will not request any size at all.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>toplevel</b> command creates a new toplevel widget (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument).  Additional options,
       described  above,  may be specified on the command line or in the option database to configure aspects of
       the toplevel such as its background color and relief.  The <b>toplevel</b> command returns the path name of  the
       new window.

       A  toplevel  is  similar to a <b>frame</b> except that it is created as a top-level window:  its X parent is the
       root window of a screen rather than the logical parent from its Tk path name.  The primary purpose  of  a
       toplevel  is to serve as a container for dialog boxes and other collections of widgets.  The only visible
       features of a toplevel are its background and an optional 3-D border to make the toplevel  appear  raised
       or sunken.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>toplevel</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is the same as the path name of the toplevel's
       window.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on  the  widget.   It  has  the  following
       general form:

              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?

       <u>PathName</u>  is  the  name of the command, which is the same as the toplevel widget's path name.  <u>Option</u> and
       the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following commands are possible  for  toplevel
       widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the
              values accepted by the <b>toplevel</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query  or  modify  the  configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a
              list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on
              the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns  a  list
              describing  the  one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the
              value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified,  then
              the  command  modifies  the  given  widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the
              command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> may have any of  the  values  accepted  by  the  <b>toplevel</b>
              command.

</pre><h4><b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       When  a  new  toplevel  is  created,  it  has no default event bindings: toplevels are not intended to be
       interactive.

       Be aware that bindings on toplevels may receive events from subwidgets.
