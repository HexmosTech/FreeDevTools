       Catalyst::Authentication::Store::Minimal - Minimal authentication store

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # you probably just want Store::Minimal under most cases,
           # but if you insist you can instantiate your own store:

           use Catalyst::Authentication::Store::Minimal;

           use Catalyst qw/
               Authentication
           /;

           __PACKAGE__-&gt;config( 'Plugin::Authentication' =&gt;
                           {
                               default_realm =&gt; 'members',
                               realms =&gt; {
                                   members =&gt; {

                                           password_type =&gt; 'clear'
                                       },
                                       store =&gt; {

                                       }
                                   }
                               }

           );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This authentication store lets you create a very quick and dirty user database in your application's
       config hash.

       You will need to include the Authentication plugin, and at least one Credential plugin to use this Store.
       Credential::Password is reccommended.

       It's purpose is mainly for testing, and it should probably be replaced by a more "serious" store for
       production.

       The hash in the config, as well as the user objects/hashes are freely mutable at runtime.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       class
           The  classname used for the store. This is part of Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication and is the method
           by which Catalyst::Authentication::Store::Minimal is loaded as the user store. For this module to  be
           used, this must be set to 'Minimal'.

       user_class
           The   class   used   for   the  user  object.  If  you  don't  specify  a  class  name,  the  default
           Catalyst::Authentication::User::Hash will be used. If you define your own class, it must inherit from
           Catalyst::Authentication::User::Hash.

       users
           This is a simple hash of users, the keys are the usenames, and the values are hashrefs  containing  a
           password  key/value  pair,  and optionally, a roles/list of role-names pair. If using roles, you will
           also need to add the Authorization::Roles plugin.

           See the SYNOPSIS for an example.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       There are no publicly exported routines in the Minimal store (or indeed in  most  authentication  stores)
       However,  below  is  a  description  of the routines required by Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication for all
       authentication stores.

   <b>new(</b> <b>$config,</b> <b>$app,</b> <b>$realm</b> <b>)</b>
       Constructs a new store object, which uses the user element of  the  supplied  config  hash  ref  as  it's
       backing structure.

   <b>find_user(</b> <b>$authinfo,</b> <b>$c</b> <b>)</b>
       Keys the hash by the 'id' or 'username' element in the authinfo hash and returns the user.

       ... documentation fairy stopped here. ...

       If the return value is unblessed it will be blessed as Catalyst::Authentication::User::Hash.

   <b>from_session(</b> <b>$id</b> <b>)</b>
       Delegates to "get_user".

   <b>user_supports(</b> <b>)</b>
       Chooses a random user from the hash and delegates to it.

   <b>get_user(</b> <b>)</b>
       Deprecated

   <b>setup(</b> <b>)</b>
