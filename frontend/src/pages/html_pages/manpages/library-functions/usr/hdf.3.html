</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       HDF  is  a  multi-object  file  format  that facilitates the transfer of various types of scientific data
       between machines and operating systems.  See <a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/release4/platforms.html">http://www.hdfgroup.org/release4/platforms.html</a> for  a  list
       of platforms currently supported.

       HDF  allows  self-definitions  of  data  content  and  easy  extensibility  for  future  enhancements  or
       compatibility with other standard formats. HDF includes Fortran and C calling interfaces,  and  utilities
       for  manipulating,  viewing,  and  analyzing  data  in HDF files. The HDF library contains interfaces for
       storing and retrieving compressed or uncompressed 8-bit  and  24-bit  raster  images  with  palettes,  n-
       Dimensional  scientific  datasets  and binary tables. An interface is also included that allows arbitrary
       grouping of other HDF objects.

   <b>HDF</b> <b>Raster</b> <b>Images</b>
       HDF supports the storing of both 8-bit and 24-bit raster images.  Beside storing  information  about  the
       dimensions and palette of a raster image, HDF supports raster image compression.  In previous versions of
       HDF  (DF  interfaces,)  Run-length  encoding  and  Imcomp compression were both supported.  The currently
       supported compression methods include  simple  RLE,  N-bit,  Skipping  huffman,  Gzip,  Szip,  and  JPEG.
       Although no longer support Imcomp compression, the library can read images with Imcomp compression.

   <b>HDF</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Sets</b>
       Scientific  Data  Sets  (SDSs) are useful for storing n-Dimensional gridded data.  The actual data in the
       dataset can be of any of the "standard" number types: 8, 16 and 32bit signed and unsigned integers and 32
       and 64bit floating point values.  In addition, a certain amount of meta-data can be stored  with  an  SDS
       including:

         o The coordinate system to use when interpreting or displaying the data.
         o Scales to be used for each dimension.
         o Labels for each dimension and the dataset as a whole.
         o Units for each dimension and the data.
         o The valid max and min values for the data.
         o Calibration information for the data.
         o Fill or missing value information.
         o Ability of having more than one file open at a time.
         o A more general framework for meta-data within the SDS data-model
           (allowing 'name = value' style meta-data.)
         o Support for an "unlimited dimension" in the SDS data-model, making
           it possible to append planes to an array along one dimension.

   <b>HDF</b> <b>Annotations</b>
       Any  object  in  an  HDF  file  can  have annotations associated with it.  There are a number of types of
       annotations:

         o Labels are assumed to be short strings giving the "name" of a
           data object.
         o Descriptions are longer text segments that are useful for giving
           more indepth information about a data object
         o File annotations are assumed to apply to all of the objects in a
           single file.

   <b>HDF</b> <b>Vset</b> <b>Interfaces</b>
       The Vset module provides interfaces to two basic HDF  building  blocks.   Vgroups  are  generic  grouping
       elements  allowing  a user to associate related objects within an HDF file.  As Vgroups can contain other
       Vgroups, it is possible to build a hierarchical file.  Vdatas are data structures made up of  fields  and
       records.   Data  is  organized  into  "fields"  within  each Vdata.  Each field is identified by a unique
       "fieldname".  The type of each field may be any of the basic number types that HDF supports.   Fields  of
       different types may exist within the same Vdata.

       By  combining  Vdatas  in  Vgroups  it  is possible to represent higher level data constructs: mesh data,
       multi-variate datasets,  sparse  matrices,  finite-element  data,  spreadsheets,  splines,  non-Cartesian
       coordinate data, etc.

   <b>HDF</b> <b>and</b> <b>netCDF</b>
       Starting with HDF version 3.3, netCDF v.2.3.2 of Unidata is supported with the SD multifile interface. SD
       and  netCDF  interfaces  can read both netCDF files and multi-dimensional arrays (SDS) stored in the HDF4
       files transparently.  For more information, see Chapter 3, "Scientific Data  Sets",  of  the  HDF  User's
       Guide.

       To  disable  netCDF  interfaces in the HDF library, configure the library using --disable-netcdf flag and
       rebuild it.

   <b>EXAMPLES</b>
       All HDF routines require the header "hdf.h" to be included in  the  C  source  file,  unless  if  the  SD
       routines are used, then the header "mfhdf.h" should be included instead.

       Fortran  programs  should  use  "dffunc.inc"  for all interfaces, "mffunc.inc" for the SD interfaces, and
       "hdf.inc" for non-SD interfaces.

       To compile a program that makes HDF calls on most Unix platforms.
