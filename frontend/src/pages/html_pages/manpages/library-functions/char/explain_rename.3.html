       explain_rename - explain <a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a>(2) errors

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;libexplain/rename.h&gt;
       const char *explain_rename(const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);
       const char *explain_errno_rename(int errnum, const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);
       void explain_message_rename(char *message, int message_size, const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);
       void explain_message_errno_rename(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, const char *oldpath, const
       char *newpath);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functions  declared in the &lt;libexplain/rename.h&gt; include file may be used to explain errors returned
       by the <u><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></u>(2) system call.

   <b>explain_rename</b>
       const char *explain_rename(const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);

       The explain_rename function is used to obtain an explanation  of  an  error  returned  by  the  <u><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></u>(2)
       function.   The  least  the  message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it will do
       much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (rename(oldpath, rewpath) &lt; 0)
              {
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_rename(oldpath, newpath));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>oldpath</u> The original oldpath, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>newpath</u> The original newpath, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></u>(2) system call.

       Returns:
               The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is  shared  by  all  libexplain  functions
               which  do  not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the next call
               to any libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b> This function is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all  threads,  and  many
       other functions in this library.

   <b>explain_errno_rename</b>
       const char *explain_errno_rename(int errnum, const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);

       The  explain_errno_rename function is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the <a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a>(2)
       function.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errnum), but usually  it  will  do
       much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (rename(oldpath, newpath) &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_errno_rename(err, oldpath,
                      newpath));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>errnum</u>  The  error  value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just before this
               function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <u>oldpath</u> The original oldpath, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>newpath</u> The original newpath, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></u>(2) system call.

       Returns:
               The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is  shared  by  all  libexplain  functions
               which  do  not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the next call
               to any libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b> This function is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all  threads,  and  many
       other functions in this library.

   <b>explain_message_rename</b>
       void explain_message_rename(char *message, int message_size, const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);

       The  explain_message_rename  function  is  used  to  obtain  an  explanation  of an error returned by the
       <u><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></u>(2) function.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but  usually  it
       will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (rename(oldpath, newpath) &lt; 0)
              {
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_rename(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), oldpath,
                      newpath);
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>message</u> The  location  in  which to store the returned message.  Because a message return buffer has been
               supplied, this function is thread safe, if the buffer is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>oldpath</u> The original oldpath, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>newpath</u> The original newpath, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></u>(2) system call.

   <b>explain_message_errno_rename</b>
       void explain_message_errno_rename(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, const char *oldpath, const
       char *newpath);

       The explain_message_errno_rename function is used to obtain an explanation of an error  returned  by  the
       <u><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></u>(2)  function.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errnum), but usually it
       will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (rename(oldpath, newpath) &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_errno_rename(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), err,
                      oldpath, newpath);
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>message</u> The location in which to store the returned message.  Because a message return  buffer  has  been
               supplied, this function is thread safe, given a thread safe buffer.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>errnum</u>  The  error  value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just before this
               function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <u>oldpath</u> The original oldpath, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>newpath</u> The original newpath, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></u>(2) system call.
