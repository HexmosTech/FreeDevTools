                                      boolean abbrev,
                                      bt_joinmethod join_tokens,
                                      bt_joinmethod join_part);
          char * bt_format_name (bt_name * name, bt_name_format * format);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       After splitting a name into its components parts (represented as a "bt_name" structure), you often want
       to put it back together again as a single string in a consistent way.  <b>btparse</b> provides a very flexible
       way to do this, generally in two stages: first, you create a "name format" which describes how to put the
       tokens and parts of any name back together, and then you apply the format to a particular name.

       The "name format" is encapsulated in a "bt_name_format" structure, which is created with
       bt_create_name_format().  This function includes some clever trickery that means you can usually get away
       with calling it alone, and not need to do any customization of the format.  If you do need to customize
       the format, though, bt_set_format_text() and bt_set_format_options() provide that capability.

       The format controls the following:

       •   which name parts are printed, and in what order (e.g. "first von last jr", or "von last jr first")

       •   the  text  that  precedes  and  follows  each part (e.g. if the first name follows the last name, you
           probably want a comma before the `first' part: "Smith, John" rather than "Smith John")

       •   the text that precedes and follows each token (e.g. if the first name is abbreviated, you may want  a
           period after each token: "J. R. Smith" rather than "J R Smith")

       •   the method used to join the tokens of each part together

       •   the method used to join each part to the following part

       All of these except the list of parts to format are kept in arrays indexed by name part: for example, the
       structure has a field

          char * post_token[BT_MAX_NAMEPARTS]

       and  "post_token[BTN_FIRST]"  ("BTN_FIRST"  is  from  the "bt_namepart" "enum") is the string to be added
       after each token in the first name---for example, "." if the first name  is  to  be  abbreviated  in  the
       conventional way.

       Yet  another  "enum", "bt_joinmethod", describes the available methods for joining tokens together.  Note
       that there are <u>two</u> sets of join methods in a name format:  between  tokens  within  a  single  part,  and
       between  the  tokens  of  two  different parts.  The first allows you, for example, to change "J R Smith"
       (first name abbreviated with no post-token text but tokens joined by a space) to "JR  Smith"  (the  same,
       but  first-name tokens jammed together).  The second is mainly used to ensure that "von" and "last" name-
       parts may be joined with a tie: "de~Roche" rather than "de Roche".

       The token join methods are:

       BTJ_MAYTIE
           Insert a "discretionary tie" between tokens.  That is,  either  a  space  or  a  "tie"  is  inserted,
           depending  on  context.   (A  "tie," otherwise known as unbreakable space, is currently hard-coded as
           "~"---from TeX.)

           The format is then applied to a particular name by bt_format_name(), which returns a new string.

       BTJ_SPACE
           Always insert a space between tokens.

       BTJ_FORCETIE
           Always insert a "tie" ("~") between tokens.

       BTJ_NOTHING
           Insert nothing between tokens---just jam them together.

       Tokens are joined together, and thus the choice of whether to insert a "discretionary tie"  is  made,  at
       two  places:  within  a  part  and between two parts.  Naturally, this only applies when "BTJ_MAYTIE" was
       supplied as the token-join method; "BTJ_SPACE" and "BTJ_FORCETIE" always insert either a  space  or  tie,
       and  "BTJ_NOTHING"  always  adds nothing between tokens.  Within a part, ties are added after a the first
       token if it is less than three characters long, and before the last token.  Between parts, a tie is added
       only if the preceding part consisted of single token that was less than three characters  long.   In  all
       other cases, spaces are inserted.  (This implementation slavishly follows BibTeX.)

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bt_create_name_format()</b>
              bt_name_format * bt_create_name_format (char * parts,
                                                      boolean abbrev_first)

           Creates  a  name  format  for  a  given  set  of  parts, with variations for the most common forms of
           customization---the order of parts and whether to abbreviate the first name.

           The "parts" parameter specifies which parts to include in a formatted name, as well as the  order  in
           which  to  format  them.  "parts" must be a string of four or fewer characters, each of which denotes
           one of the four name parts: for instance, "vljf" means to format all  four  parts  in  "von  last  jr
           first"  order.   No  characters  outside  of  the  set  "fvlj"  are allowed, and no characters may be
           repeated.  "abbrev_first" controls whether the `first' part will be abbreviated (i.e., only the first
           letter from each token will be printed).

           In addition to simply setting the list of parts to format and the "abbreviate"  flag  for  the  first
           name,  bt_create_name_format() initializes the entire format structure so as to minimize the need for
           further customizations:

           •   The "token join method"---what to insert between tokens of the same part---is set to "BTJ_MAYTIE"
               (discretionary tie) for all parts

           •   The "part join method"---what to insert after the final token  of  a  particular  part,  assuming
               there are more parts to come---is set to "BTJ_SPACE" for the `first', `last', and `jr' parts.  If
               the  `von'  part is present and immediately precedes the `last' part (which will almost always be
               the case), "BTJ_MAYTIE" is used to join `von' to `last'; otherwise, `von' also  gets  "BTJ_SPACE"
               for the inter-part join method.

           •   The  abbreviation  flag is set to "FALSE" for the `von', `last', and `jr' parts; for `first', the
               abbreviation flag is set to whatever you pass in as "abbrev_first".

           •   Initially, all "surrounding text" (pre-part, post-part, pre-token, and post-token) for all  parts
               is set to the empty string.  Then a few tweaks are done, depending on the "abbrev_first" flag and
               the  order  of tokens.  First, if "abbrev_first" is "TRUE", the post-token text for first name is
               set to "."---this changes "J R Smith" to "J. R. Smith", which is usually the desired  form.   (If
               you   <u>don't</u>   want   the   periods,  you'll  have  to  set  the  post-token  text  yourself  with
               bt_set_format_text().)

               Then, if `jr' is present and immediately after `last' (almost always the case), the pre-part text
               for `jr' is set to ", ", and the inter-part join method for `last' is set to "BTJ_NOTHING".  This
               changes "John Smith Jr" (where the space following "Smith" comes from formatting  the  last  name
               with  a "BTJ_SPACE" inter-part join method) to "John Smith, Jr" (where the ", " is now associated
               with "Jr"---that way, if there is no `jr' part, the ", " will not be printed.)

               Finally, if `first' is present and immediately follows either `jr' or `last' (which will  usually
               be  the  case  in  "last-name first" formats), the same sort of trickery is applied: the pre-part
               text for `first' is set to ", ", and the part join method for the preceding part (either `jr'  or
               `last') is set to "BTJ_NOTHING".

           While  all these rules are rather complicated, they mean that you are usually freed from having to do
           any customization of the name format.  Certainly this is the case if you only need "fvlj" and  "vljf"
           part  orders,  only  want  to  abbreviate the first name, want periods after abbreviated tokens, non-
           breaking spaces in the "right" places, and commas in the conventional places.

           If you want something out of the ordinary---for instance, abbreviated tokens jammed together with  no
           puncuation,  or  abbreviated  last  names---you'll  need  to  customize  the  name  format a bit with
           bt_set_format_text() and bt_set_format_options().

       <b>bt_free_name_format()</b>
              void bt_free_name_format (bt_name_format * format)

           Frees a name format created by bt_create_name_format().

       <b>bt_set_format_text()</b>
              void bt_set_format_text (bt_name_format * format,
                                       bt_namepart part,
                                       char * pre_part,
                                       char * post_part,
                                       char * pre_token,
                                       char * post_token)

           Allows you to customize some or all of the surrounding text for a single name  part.   Supply  "NULL"
           for any chunk of text that you don't want to change.

           For  instance,  say  you  want  a  name  format  that  will  abbreviate  first names, but without any
           punctuation after the abbreviated tokens.  You could create and customize the format as follows:

              format = bt_create_name_format ("fvlj", TRUE);
              bt_set_format_text (format,
                                  BTN_FIRST,       /* name-part to customize */
                                  NULL, NULL,      /* pre- and post- part text */
                                  NULL, "");       /* empty string for post-token */

           Without the bt_set_format_text() call, "format" would result in names formatted like "J.  R.  Smith".
           After setting the post-token text for first names to "", this name would become "J R Smith".

       <b>bt_set_format_options()</b>
              void bt_set_format_options (bt_name_format * format,
                                          bt_namepart part,
                                          boolean abbrev,
                                          bt_joinmethod join_tokens,
                                          bt_joinmethod join_part)

           Allows  further  customization of a name format: you can set the abbreviation flag and the two token-
           join methods.  Alas, there is no mechanism for leaving a value unchanged;  you  must  set  everything
           with bt_set_format_options().

           For  example,  let's  say  that just dropping periods from abbreviated tokens in the first name isn't
           enough; you <u>really</u> want to save space by jamming the abbreviated tokens together: "JR  Smith"  rather
           than  "J  R  Smith"   Assuming  the two calls in the above example have been done, the following will
           finish the job:

              bt_set_format_options (format, BTN_FIRST,
                                     TRUE,         /* keep same value for abbrev flag */
                                     BTJ_NOTHING,  /* jam tokens together */
                                     BTJ_SPACE);   /* space after final token of part */

           Note that we unfortunately had to know (and supply) the current values for the abbreviation flag  and
           post-part join method, even though we were only setting the intra-part join method.

       <b>bt_format_name()</b>
              char * bt_format_name (bt_name * name, bt_name_format * format)

           Once  a name format has been created and customized to your heart's content, you can use it to format
           any number of names that have been split with "bt_split_name" (see bt_split_names).  Simply pass  the
           name  structure and name format structure, and a newly-allocated string containing the formatted name
           will be returned to you.  It is your responsibility to free() this string.
