       explain_fpurge - explain <u><a href="../man3/fpurge.3.html">fpurge</a></u>(3) errors

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;libexplain/fpurge.h&gt;
       const char *explain_fpurge(FILE *fp);
       const char *explain_errno_fpurge(int errnum, FILE *fp);
       void explain_message_fpurge(char *message, int message_size, FILE *fp);
       void explain_message_errno_fpurge(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, FILE *fp);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These functions may be used to obtain explanations for errors returned by the <u><a href="../man3/fpurge.3.html">fpurge</a></u>(3) system call.

   <b>explain_fpurge</b>
       const char *explain_fpurge(FILE *fp);

       The <b>explain_fpurge</b> function is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the <u><a href="../man3/fpurge.3.html">fpurge</a></u>(3) system
       call.  The  least  the  message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it will do much
       better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       <u>fp</u>      The original fp, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/fpurge.3.html">fpurge</a></u>(3) system call.

       Returns:
               The message explaining the error. This message buffer is shared by all libexplain functions which
               do not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to  any
               libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b>  This  function  is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all threads, and many
       other functions in this library.

       <b>Example:</b> This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (fpurge(fp) &lt; 0)
              {
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_fpurge(fp));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre‐packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_fpurge_or_die.3.html">explain_fpurge_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

   <b>explain_errno_fpurge</b>
       const char *explain_errno_fpurge(int errnum, FILE *fp);

       The <b>explain_errno_fpurge</b> function is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the  <u><a href="../man3/fpurge.3.html">fpurge</a></u>(3)
       system  call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it will do
       much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       <u>errnum</u>  The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just  before  this
               function  is called. This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <u>fp</u>      The original fp, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/fpurge.3.html">fpurge</a></u>(3) system call.

       Returns:
               The message explaining the error. This message buffer is shared by all libexplain functions which
               do not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to  any
               libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b>  This  function  is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all threads, and many
       other functions in this library.

       <b>Example:</b> This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (fpurge(fp) &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_errno_fpurge(err, fp));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre‐packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_fpurge_or_die.3.html">explain_fpurge_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

   <b>explain_message_fpurge</b>
       void explain_message_fpurge(char *message, int message_size, FILE *fp);

       The <b>explain_message_fpurge</b> function is used to  obtain  an  explanation  of  an  error  returned  by  the
       <u><a href="../man3/fpurge.3.html">fpurge</a></u>(3) system call. The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it
       will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       <u>message</u> The  location  in  which  to  store  the returned message. If a suitable message return buffer is
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>fp</u>      The original fp, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/fpurge.3.html">fpurge</a></u>(3) system call.

       <b>Example:</b> This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (fpurge(fp) &lt; 0)
              {
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_fpurge(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), fp);
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre‐packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_fpurge_or_die.3.html">explain_fpurge_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

   <b>explain_message_errno_fpurge</b>
       void explain_message_errno_fpurge(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, FILE *fp);

       The <b>explain_message_errno_fpurge</b> function is used to obtain an explanation of an error  returned  by  the
       <u><a href="../man3/fpurge.3.html">fpurge</a></u>(3) system call. The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it
       will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       <u>message</u> The  location  in  which  to  store  the returned message. If a suitable message return buffer is
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>errnum</u>  The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just  before  this
