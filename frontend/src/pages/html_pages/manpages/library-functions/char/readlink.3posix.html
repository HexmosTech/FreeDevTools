</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       readlink, readlinkat — read the contents of a symbolic link

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;

       ssize_t readlink(const char *restrict <u>path</u>, char *restrict <u>buf</u>,
           size_t <u>bufsize</u>);

       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/fcntl.h">fcntl.h</a>&gt;

       ssize_t readlinkat(int <u>fd</u>, const char *restrict <u>path</u>,
           char *restrict <u>buf</u>, size_t <u>bufsize</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>readlink</u>()  function shall place the contents of the symbolic link referred to by <u>path</u> in the buffer
       <u>buf</u> which has size <u>bufsize</u>.  If the number of bytes in the  symbolic  link  is  less  than  <u>bufsize</u>,  the
       contents  of the remainder of <u>buf</u> are unspecified. If the <u>buf</u> argument is not large enough to contain the
       link content, the first <u>bufsize</u> bytes shall be placed in <u>buf</u>.

       If the value of <u>bufsize</u> is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result is implementation-defined.

       Upon successful completion, <u>readlink</u>() shall mark for update  the  last  data  access  timestamp  of  the
       symbolic link.

       The  <u>readlinkat</u>()  function  shall be equivalent to the <u>readlink</u>() function except in the case where <u>path</u>
       specifies a relative path. In this case the symbolic link whose  content  is  read  is  relative  to  the
       directory  associated with the file descriptor <u>fd</u> instead of the current working directory. If the access
       mode of the open file description associated with the file descriptor is not O_SEARCH, the function shall
       check whether directory searches are permitted using the current permissions of the directory  underlying
       the file descriptor. If the access mode is O_SEARCH, the function shall not perform the check.

       If  <u>readlinkat</u>()  is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the <u>fd</u> parameter, the current working directory
       shall be used and the behavior shall be identical to a call to <u>readlink</u>().

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return  the  count  of  bytes  placed  in  the  buffer.
       Otherwise,  these  functions  shall  return  a  value of -1, leave the buffer unchanged, and set <u>errno</u> to
       indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix of <u>path</u>.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The <u>path</u> argument names a file that is not a symbolic link.

       <b>EIO</b>    An I/O error occurred while reading from the file system.

       <b>ELOOP</b>  A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the <u>path</u> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT</b> A component of <u>path</u> does not name an existing file or <u>path</u> is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that is neither a directory nor  a  symbolic
              link  to  a  directory,  or the <u>path</u> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt; character and ends
              with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters and the last pathname  component  names  an  existing
              file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       The <u>readlinkat</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> The  access  mode  of  the  open  file  description  associated  with  <u>fd</u>  is not O_SEARCH and the
              permissions of the directory underlying <u>fd</u> do not permit directory searches.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>path</u> argument does not specify an absolute path and the <u>fd</u> argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor  a
              valid file descriptor open for reading or searching.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The  <u>path</u>  argument  is  not  an  absolute path and <u>fd</u> is a file descriptor associated with a non-
              directory file.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP</b>  More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the <u>path</u> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an
              intermediate result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>Name</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Symbolic</b> <b>Link</b>
       The following example shows how to read the name of a symbolic link named <b>/modules/pass1</b>.

           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;

           char buf[1024];
           ssize_t len;
           ...
           if ((len = readlink("/modules/pass1", buf, sizeof(buf)-1)) != -1)
               buf[len] = '\0';

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Conforming applications should not assume that the returned contents  of  the  symbolic  link  are  null-
       terminated.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  type  associated  with <u>bufsiz</u> is a <b>size_t</b> in order to be consistent with both the ISO C standard and
       the definition of <u>read</u>().   The  behavior  specified  for  <u>readlink</u>()  when  <u>bufsiz</u>  is  zero  represents
       historical  practice. For this case, the standard developers considered a change whereby <u>readlink</u>() would
       return the number of non-null bytes contained  in  the  symbolic  link  with  the  buffer  <u>buf</u>  remaining
       unchanged;  however,  since  the <b>stat</b> structure member <u>st_size</u> value can be used to determine the size of
       buffer necessary to contain the contents of the symbolic link as returned by  <u>readlink</u>(),  this  proposal
       was rejected, and the historical practice retained.

       The  purpose  of  the <u>readlinkat</u>() function is to read the content of symbolic links in directories other
       than the current working directory without exposure to race conditions.  Any part of the path of  a  file
       could  be  changed  in  parallel to a call to <u>readlink</u>(), resulting in unspecified behavior. By opening a
       file descriptor for the target directory and using the <u>readlinkat</u>() function it can  be  guaranteed  that
       the symbolic link read is located relative to the desired directory.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
