</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MPI_Publish_name -  Publish a service name for dynamic process control

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;mpi.h&gt;
       int
       MPI_Publish_name(char *service_name, MPI_Info info, char *port_name)

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>service_name</b>
              - a service name to associate with the port
       <b>info</b>   - implementation-specific information
       <b>port_name</b>
              - a port name from <u>MPI_Open_port</u>

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Currently,  LAM/MPI  ignores any info keys that are passed to this function.  As such, info keys specific
       to a different implementation can safely be passed to this  function.   Additionally,  the  MPI  constant
       <u>MPI_INFO_NULL</u> can also be used.

       The  scope  of  the published name is the LAM universe -- MPI processes running on any node included from
       the initial lamboot are capable of retrieving a name published by <u>MPI_Publish_name</u> .  Service names  stay
       in  existence until they are either manually removed with <u>MPI_Unpublish_name</u> or cleaned with the <u>lamclean</u>
       command.  It is a common mistake to forget to <u>MPI_Unpublish_name</u> at the end of a run, and therefore leave
       published names in the LAM runtime environment.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>FORTRAN</b></h4><pre>
       All MPI routines in Fortran (except for <u>MPI_WTIME</u> and <u>MPI_WTICK</u> ) have an additional argument <u>ierr</u> at the
       end of the argument list.  <u>ierr</u> is an integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine
       in C.  In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the <u>call</u> statement.

       All MPI objects (e.g., <u>MPI_Datatype</u> , <u>MPI_Comm</u> ) are of type <u>INTEGER</u> in Fortran.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       If an error occurs in an MPI function, the current MPI error handler is called to handle it.  By default,
       this error handler aborts the MPI job.  The error handler may be changed with  <u>MPI_Errhandler_set</u>  ;  the
       predefined  error  handler  <u>MPI_ERRORS_RETURN</u>  may be used to cause error values to be returned (in C and
       Fortran; this error handler is less useful in with the C++ MPI bindings.  The  predefined  error  handler
       <u>MPI::ERRORS_THROW_EXCEPTIONS</u>  should be used in C++ if the error value needs to be recovered).  Note that
       MPI does <u>not</u> guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.

       All MPI routines (except <u>MPI_Wtime</u> and <u>MPI_Wtick</u> ) return an error value; C routines as the value of  the
       function and Fortran routines in the last argument.  The C++ bindings for MPI do not return error values;
       instead,  error  values  are  communicated  by  throwing  exceptions  of  type <u>MPI::Exception</u> (but not by
       default).  Exceptions are only thrown if the error value is not <u>MPI::SUCCESS</u> .

       Note that if the <u>MPI::ERRORS_RETURN</u> handler is set in C++, while MPI functions will return upon an error,
       there will be no way to recover what the actual error value was.
       <b>MPI_SUCCESS</b>
              - No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
       <b>MPI_ERR_ARG</b>
              - Invalid argument.  Some argument is invalid and is not identified by  a  specific  error  class.
              This is typically a NULL pointer or other such error.
       <b>MPI_ERR_SERVICE</b>
              -  This  error class is associated with an error code that indicates that there was a problem with
              the service name that was used.  Depending on the context, this can indicate that the service name
              was already published or that the service name was not yet published.

       For more information, please see the official MPI Forum web site, which contains the  text  of  both  the
       MPI-1 and MPI-2 standards.  These documents contain detailed information about each MPI function (most of
       which is not duplicated in these man pages).
