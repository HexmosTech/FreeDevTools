</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       strptime — date and time conversion

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/time.h">time.h</a>&gt;

       char *strptime(const char *restrict <u>buf</u>, const char *restrict <u>format</u>,
           struct tm *restrict <u>tm</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>strptime</u>()  function shall convert the character string pointed to by <u>buf</u> to values which are stored
       in the <b>tm</b> structure pointed to by <u>tm</u>, using the format specified by <u>format</u>.

       The format is composed of zero or more directives. Each directive is composed of one  of  the  following:
       one  or more white-space characters (as specified by <u>isspace</u>()); an ordinary character (neither <b>'%'</b> nor a
       white-space character); or a conversion specification.

       Each conversion specification is introduced by the <b>'%'</b> character after  which  the  following  appear  in
       sequence:

        *  An optional flag, the zero character (<b>'0'</b>) or the &lt;plus-sign&gt; character (<b>'+'</b>), which is ignored.

        *  An  optional  field  width.  If  a  field  width is specified, it shall be interpreted as a string of
           decimal digits that will determine the maximum number of bytes converted for  the  conversion  rather
           than the number of bytes specified below in the description of the conversion specifiers.

        *  An optional <b>E</b> or <b>O</b> modifier.

        *  A terminating conversion specifier character that indicates the type of conversion to be applied.

       The  conversions  are  determined using the <u>LC_TIME</u> category of the current locale. The application shall
       ensure that there is  white-space  or  other  non-alphanumeric  characters  between  any  two  conversion
       specifications  unless  all  of  the  adjacent conversion specifications convert a known, fixed number of
       characters. In the following list, the maximum number of characters scanned (excluding the  one  matching
       the next directive) is as follows:

        *  If a maximum field width is specified, then that number

        *  Otherwise, the pattern <b>"{x}"</b> indicates that the maximum is <u>x</u>

        *  Otherwise,  the  pattern  <b>"[x,y]"</b>  indicates  that  the value shall fall within the range given (both
           bounds being inclusive), and the maximum number of characters scanned shall be the  maximum  required
           to represent any value in the range without leading zeros and without a leading &lt;plus-sign&gt;

       The following conversion specifiers are supported.

       The results are unspecified if a modifier is specified with a flag or with a minimum field width, or if a
       field width is specified for any conversion specifier other than <b>C</b> or <b>Y</b>.

       a       The day of the week, using the locale's weekday names; either the abbreviated or full name may be
               specified.

       A       Equivalent to <b>%a</b>.

       b       The month, using the locale's month names; either the abbreviated or full name may be specified.

       B       Equivalent to <b>%b</b>.

       c       Replaced by the locale's appropriate date and time representation.

       C       All  but  the  last two digits of the year {2}; leading zeros shall be permitted but shall not be
               required. A leading <b>'+'</b> or <b>'-'</b> character shall be permitted before any leading  zeros  but  shall
               not be required.

       d       The day of the month [01,31]; leading zeros shall be permitted but shall not be required.

       D       The date as <b>%m</b>/<b>%d</b>/<b>%y</b>.

       e       Equivalent to <b>%d</b>.

       h       Equivalent to <b>%b</b>.

       H       The hour (24-hour clock) [00,23]; leading zeros shall be permitted but shall not be required.

       I       The hour (12-hour clock) [01,12]; leading zeros shall be permitted but shall not be required.

       j       The day number of the year [001,366]; leading zeros shall be permitted but shall not be required.

       m       The month number [01,12]; leading zeros shall be permitted but shall not be required.

       M       The minute [00,59]; leading zeros shall be permitted but shall not be required.

       n       Any white space.

       p       The locale's equivalent of a.m. or p.m.

       r       12-hour  clock  time using the AM/PM notation if <b>t_fmt_ampm</b> is not an empty string in the <u>LC_TIME</u>
               portion of the current locale; in the POSIX locale, this shall be equivalent to <b>%I</b>:<b>%M</b>:<b>%S</b> <b>%p</b>.

       R       The time as <b>%H</b>:<b>%M</b>.

       S       The seconds [00,60]; leading zeros shall be permitted but shall not be required.

       t       Any white space.

       T       The time as <b>%H</b>:<b>%M</b>:<b>%S</b>.

       U       The week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of the week) as a  decimal  number  [00,53];
               leading zeros shall be permitted but shall not be required.

       w       The weekday as a decimal number [0,6], with 0 representing Sunday.

       W       The  week  number  of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number [00,53];
               leading zeros shall be permitted but shall not be required.

       x       The date, using the locale's date format.

       X       The time, using the locale's time format.

       y       The last two digits of the year. When <u>format</u> contains neither a <b>C</b> conversion specifier  nor  a  <b>Y</b>
               conversion specifier, values in the range [69,99] shall refer to years 1969 to 1999 inclusive and
               values  in  the range [00,68] shall refer to years 2000 to 2068 inclusive; leading zeros shall be
               permitted but shall not be required. A leading <b>'+'</b> or <b>'-'</b> character shall be permitted before any
               leading zeros but shall not be required.

               <b>Note:</b>     It is expected that in a future version of this standard the default  century  inferred
                         from  a 2-digit year will change. (This would apply to all commands accepting a 2-digit
                         year as input.)

       Y       The full year {4}; leading zeros shall be permitted but shall not be required. A leading  <b>'+'</b>  or
               <b>'-'</b> character shall be permitted before any leading zeros but shall not be required.

       %       Replaced by <b>%</b>.

   <b>Modified</b> <b>Conversion</b> <b>Specifiers</b>
       Some  conversion  specifiers  can  be  modified  by  the  <b>E</b> and <b>O</b> modifier characters to indicate that an
       alternative format or specification should be used rather than the one normally used  by  the  unmodified
       conversion  specifier.  If  the alternative format or specification does not exist in the current locale,
       the behavior shall be as if the unmodified conversion specification were used.

       %Ec     The locale's alternative appropriate date and time representation.

       %EC     The name of the base year (period) in the locale's alternative representation.

       %Ex     The locale's alternative date representation.

       %EX     The locale's alternative time representation.

       %Ey     The offset from <b>%EC</b> (year only) in the locale's alternative representation.

       %EY     The full alternative year representation.

       %Od     The day of the month using the locale's alternative  numeric  symbols;  leading  zeros  shall  be
               permitted but shall not be required.

       %Oe     Equivalent to <b>%Od</b>.

       %OH     The hour (24-hour clock) using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OI     The hour (12-hour clock) using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %Om     The month using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OM     The minutes using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OS     The seconds using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OU     The  week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of the week) using the locale's alternative
               numeric symbols.

       %Ow     The number of the weekday (Sunday=0) using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OW     The week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) using the locale's  alternative
               numeric symbols.

       %Oy     The year (offset from <b>%C</b>) using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       A  conversion  specification  composed  of white-space characters is executed by scanning input up to the
       first character that is not white-space (which remains unscanned), or until no  more  characters  can  be
       scanned.

       A  conversion specification that is an ordinary character is executed by scanning the next character from
       the buffer. If the character scanned from the buffer differs from the one comprising the  directive,  the
       directive fails, and the differing and subsequent characters remain unscanned.

       A  series  of conversion specifications composed of <b>%n</b>, <b>%t</b>, white-space characters, or any combination is
       executed by scanning up to the first character that is not white  space  (which  remains  unscanned),  or
       until no more characters can be scanned.

       Any other conversion specification is executed by scanning characters until a character matching the next
       directive  is  scanned,  or  until  no  more  characters can be scanned. These characters, except the one
       matching the next directive, are then compared to  the  locale  values  associated  with  the  conversion
       specifier.  If  a  match  is  found,  values  for  the appropriate <b>tm</b> structure members are set to values
       corresponding to the locale information. Case is ignored when matching items in  <u>buf</u>  such  as  month  or
       weekday names. If no match is found, <u>strptime</u>() fails and no more characters are scanned.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful  completion,  <u>strptime</u>()  shall  return  a  pointer  to the character following the last
       character parsed. Otherwise, a null pointer shall be returned.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Convert</b> <b>a</b> <b>Date-Plus-Time</b> <b>String</b> <b>to</b> <b>Broken-Down</b> <b>Time</b> <b>and</b> <b>Then</b> <b>into</b> <b>Seconds</b>
       The following example demonstrates the use of <u>strptime</u>() to convert a string into broken-down  time.  The
       broken-down time is then converted into seconds since the Epoch using <u>mktime</u>().

           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/time.h">time.h</a>&gt;
           ...

           struct tm tm;
           time_t t;

           if (strptime("6 Dec 2001 12:33:45", "%d %b %Y %H:%M:%S", &amp;tm) == NULL)
               /* Handle error */;

           printf("year: %d; month: %d; day: %d;\n",
                   tm.tm_year, tm.tm_mon, tm.tm_mday);
           printf("hour: %d; minute: %d; second: %d\n",
                   tm.tm_hour, tm.tm_min, tm.tm_sec);
           printf("week day: %d; year day: %d\n", tm.tm_wday, tm.tm_yday);

           tm.tm_isdst = -1;      /* Not set by strptime(); tells mktime()
                                     to determine whether daylight saving time
                                     is in effect */
           t = mktime(&amp;tm);
           if (t == -1)
               /* Handle error */;
           printf("seconds since the Epoch: %ld\n", (long) t);"

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Several  ``equivalent  to''  formats and the special processing of white-space characters are provided in
       order to ease the use of identical <u>format</u> strings for <u>strftime</u>() and <u>strptime</u>().

       It should be noted that dates constructed by the <u>strftime</u>() function  with  the  <b>%Y</b>  or  <b>%C%y</b>  conversion
       specifiers may have values larger than 9999. If the <u>strptime</u>() function is used to read such values using
       <b>%C%y</b>  or <b>%Y</b>, the year values will be truncated to four digits. Applications should use <b>%+</b><u>w</u><b>%y</b> or <b>%+</b><u>x</u><b>Y</b> with
       <u>w</u> and <u>x</u> set large enough to contain the full value of any years that will be printed or scanned.

       See also the APPLICATION USAGE section in <u>strftime</u>().

       It is unspecified whether multiple calls to <u>strptime</u>() using  the  same  <b>tm</b>  structure  will  update  the
       current  contents  of  the  structure or overwrite all contents of the structure. Conforming applications
       should make a single call to <u>strptime</u>() with a format and all data needed to completely specify the  date
       and time being converted.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       See the RATIONALE section for <u>strftime</u>().

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
