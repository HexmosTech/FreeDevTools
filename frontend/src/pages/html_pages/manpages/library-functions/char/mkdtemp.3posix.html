</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mkdtemp, mkstemp — create a unique directory or file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</a>&gt;

       char *mkdtemp(char *<u>template</u>);
       int mkstemp(char *<u>template</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>mkdtemp</u>()  function  shall  create  a  directory  with  a  unique  name  derived from <u>template</u>.  The
       application shall ensure that the string provided in <u>template</u> is a pathname  ending  with  at  least  six
       trailing <b>'X'</b> characters. The <u>mkdtemp</u>() function shall modify the contents of <u>template</u> by replacing six or
       more  <b>'X'</b>  characters  at  the  end  of the pathname with the same number of characters from the portable
       filename character set. The characters shall  be  chosen  such  that  the  resulting  pathname  does  not
       duplicate  the  name  of  an  existing file at the time of the call to <u>mkdtemp</u>().  The <u>mkdtemp</u>() function
       shall use the resulting pathname to create the new directory as if by a call to:

           mkdir(pathname, S_IRWXU)

       The <u>mkstemp</u>() function shall create a regular file with a unique name derived from <u>template</u> and return  a
       file  descriptor  for the file open for reading and writing. The application shall ensure that the string
       provided in <u>template</u> is a pathname ending with at  least  six  trailing  <b>'X'</b>  characters.  The  <u>mkstemp</u>()
       function  shall modify the contents of <u>template</u> by replacing six or more <b>'X'</b> characters at the end of the
       pathname with the same number of characters from the portable  filename  character  set.  The  characters
       shall  be  chosen such that the resulting pathname does not duplicate the name of an existing file at the
       time of the call to <u>mkstemp</u>().  The <u>mkstemp</u>() function shall use the resulting  pathname  to  create  the
       file, and obtain a file descriptor for it, as if by a call to:

           open(pathname, O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR)

       By  behaving  as  if the O_EXCL flag for <u>open</u>() is set, the function prevents any possible race condition
       between testing whether the file exists and opening it for use.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <u>mkdtemp</u>() function shall return the value  of  <u>template</u>.   Otherwise,  it
       shall return a null pointer and shall set <u>errno</u> to indicate the error.

       Upon  successful  completion,  the <u>mkstemp</u>() function shall return an open file descriptor. Otherwise, it
       shall return -1 and shall set <u>errno</u> to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>mkdtemp</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix, or write permission  is  denied  on
              the parent directory of the directory to be created.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The string pointed to by <u>template</u> does not end in <b>"XXXXXX"</b>.

       <b>ELOOP</b>  A  loop  exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the path of the directory to be
              created.

       <b>EMLINK</b> The link count of the parent directory would exceed {LINK_MAX}.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT</b> A component of the path prefix specified by the  <u>template</u>  argument  does  not  name  an  existing
              directory.

       <b>ENOSPC</b> The  file  system  does  not  contain enough space to hold the contents of the new directory or to
              extend the parent directory of the new directory.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that is neither a directory nor  a  symbolic
              link to a directory.

       <b>EROFS</b>  The parent directory resides on a read-only file system.

       The <u>mkdtemp</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP</b>  More  than  {SYMLOOP_MAX}  symbolic  links  were  encountered during resolution of the path of the
              directory to be created.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an
              intermediate result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       The error conditions for the <u>mkstemp</u>() function are defined in <u>open</u>().

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Generating</b> <b>a</b> <b>Pathname</b>
       The following example creates a file with a 10-character name beginning with the  characters  <b>"file"</b>  and
       opens  the  file for reading and writing. The value returned as the value of <u>fd</u> is a file descriptor that
       identifies the file.

           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</a>&gt;
           ...
           char template[] = "/tmp/fileXXXXXX";
           int fd;

           fd = mkstemp(template);

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       It is possible to run out of letters.

       Portable applications should pass exactly six trailing <b>'X'</b>s in the template and no more;  implementations
       may  treat any additional trailing <b>'X'</b>s as either a fixed or replaceable part of the template. To be sure
       of only passing six, a fixed string of at least one non-<b>'X'</b> character should precede the six <b>'X'</b>s.

       Since <b>'X'</b> is in the portable filename character set, some of the  replacement  characters  can  be  <b>'X'</b>s,
       leaving part (or even all) of the template effectively unchanged.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
