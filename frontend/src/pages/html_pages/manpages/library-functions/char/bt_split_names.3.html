       bt_split_names - splitting up BibTeX names and lists of names

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          bt_stringlist * bt_split_list (char *   string,
                                         char *   delim,
                                         char *   filename,
                                         int      line,
                                         char *   description);
          void bt_free_list (bt_stringlist *list);
          bt_name * bt_split_name (char *  name,
                                   char *  filename,
                                   int     line,
                                   int     name_num);
          void bt_free_name (bt_name * name);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When BibTeX files are used for their original purpose---bibliographic entries describing scholarly
       publications---processing lists of names (authors and editors mostly) becomes important.  Although such
       name-processing is outside the general-purpose database domain of most of the <b>btparse</b> library, these
       splitting functions are provided as a concession to reality: most BibTeX data files use the BibTeX
       conventions for author names, and a library to process that data ought to be capable of processing the
       names.

       Name-processing comes in two stages: first, split up a list of names into individual strings; second,
       split up each name into "parts" (first, von, last, and jr).  The first is actually quite general: you
       could pick a delimiter (such as 'and', used for lists of names) and use it to divide any string into
       substrings.  bt_split_list() could then be called to break up the original string and extract the
       substrings.  bt_split_name(), however, is quite specific to four-part author names written using BibTeX
       conventions.  (These conventions are described informally in any BibTeX documentation; the description
       you will find here is more formal and algorithmic---and thus harder to understand.)

       See bt_format_names for information on turning split-up names back into strings in a variety of ways.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bt_split_list()</b>
              bt_stringlist * bt_split_list (char *   string,
                                             char *   delim,
                                             char *   filename,
                                             int      line,
                                             char *   description)

           Splits  "string"  into  substrings  delimited  by  "delim"  (a  fixed string).  The splitting is done
           according to the rules used by BibTeX for splitting up a list of names, in particular:

           •   delimiters at beginning or end of string are ignored

           •   delimiters must be surrounded by whitespace

           •   matching of delimiters is case insensitive

           •   delimiters at non-zero brace depth are ignored

           For instance, if the delimiter is "and", then the string

              Candy and Apples AnD {Green Eggs and Ham}

           splits into three substrings: "Candy", "Apples", and "{Green Eggs and Ham}".

           If there are extra delimiters at the extremities of the string---say, an "and" at  the  beginning  of
           the  string---then  they  are included in the first/last string; no warning is currently printed, but
           this may change.  Successive delimiters ("and and") result in a warning and a NULL string being added
           to the list of substrings.  For instance, the string

              and Joe Q. Blow and and Smith, Jr., John

           would split into three substrings: "and Joe Q. Blow", "NULL", and "Smith, Jr., John".

           (If these rules seem somewhat odd, don't blame me: I just implemented BibTeX's observed behaviour and
           added warning messages for one of the more obvious and easily-detected mistakes.)

           The substrings are returned as a "bt_stringlist" structure:

              typedef struct
              {
                 char *  string;
                 int     num_items;
                 char ** items;
              } bt_stringlist;

           There is currently no elegant interface to this structure:  you  just  have  to  poke  around  in  it
           yourself.  The fields are:

           "string"
               a copy of the "string" parameter passed to bt_split_list(), but with NUL characters replacing the
               space  after  each substring.  (This is safe because delimiters must be surrounded by whitespace,
               which means that each substring is followed by whitespace which is not part  of  the  substring.)
               You probably shouldn't fiddle with "string"; it's just there so that bt_free_list() has something
               to free().

           "num_items"
               the number of substrings found in the string passed to bt_split_list().

           "items"
               an  array  of  "num_items" pointers into "string".  For instance, "items[1]" points to the second
               substring.  Since "string" has been mangled with NUL characters, it is safe to  treat  "items[i]"
               as a regular C string.

               "filename",  "line",  and "description" are all used for generating warning messages.  "filename"
               and "line" simply describe where the string came from, and "description" is a  brief  (one  word)
               description of the substrings.  For instance, if you are splitting a list of names, supply "name"
               for "description"---that way, warnings will refer to "name X" rather than "substring x".

       <b>bt_free_list()</b>
              void bt_free_list (bt_stringlist *list)

           Frees  a "bt_stringlist" structure as returned by bt_split_list().  That is, it frees the copy of the
           string you passed to bt_split_list(), and then frees the structure itself.

       <b>bt_split_name()</b>
              bt_name * bt_split_name (char *  name,
                                       char *  filename,
                                       int     line,
                                       int     name_num)

           Splits a single BibTeX-style author name into four parts: first, von, last, and jr.  This can  handle
           almost all names in the style of the major Western European languages, but not quite.  (Alas!)

           A name is split by first dividing into tokens; tokens are separated by whitespace or commas at brace-
           level zero.  Thus the name

              van der Graaf, Horace Q.

           has five tokens, whereas the name

              {Foo, Bar, and Sons}

           consists of a single token.

           How  tokens  are  divided  into  parts depends on the form of the name.  If the name has no commas at
           brace-level zero (as in the second example), then it is assumed to  be  in  either  "first  last"  or
           "first von last" form.  If there are no tokens that start with a lower-case letter, then "first last"
           form  is  assumed:  the  final  token  is  the  last  name, and all other tokens form the first name.
           Otherwise, the earliest contiguous sequence of tokens with initial lower-case letters is taken as the
           `von' part; if this sequence includes the final token, then a warning is printed and the final  token
           is forced to be the `last' part.

           If a name has a single comma, then it is assumed to be in "von last, first" form.  A leading sequence
           of tokens with initial lower-case letters, if any, forms the `von' part; tokens between the `von' and
           the  comma  form  the `last' part; tokens following the comma form the `first' part.  Again, if there
           are no token following a leading sequence of lowercase tokens, a warning is  printed  and  the  token
           immediately preceding the comma is taken to be the `last' part.

           If  a  name has more than two commas, a warning is printed and the name is treated as though only the
           first two commas were present.

           Finally, if a name has two commas, it is assumed to be in "von last, jr, first" form.  (This  is  the
           only  way  to  represent a name with a `jr' part.)  The parsing of the name is the same as for a one-
           comma name, except that tokens between the two commas are taken to be the `jr' part.

           The one case not properly handled by BibTeX name conventions is a name with a 'jr' part not separated
           from the last name by a comma; for example:

              Henry Ford Jr.
              George Herbert Walker Bush III

           Both of these would be incorrectly interpreted by both BibTeX and <b>bt_split_name()</b>: the "Jr." or "III"
           token would be taken as the last name, and the other tokekens as a two- or four-part first name.  The
           workaround is to shoehorn the 'jr' into the last name:

              Henry {Ford Jr.}
              George Herbert Walker {Bush III}

           but this will make it impossible to extract the last name on its own, e.g. to generate  "author-year"
           style citations.  This design flaw may be fixed in a future version of <b>btparse</b>.

           The split-up name is returned as a "bt_name" structure:

              typedef struct
              {
                 bt_stringlist * tokens;
                 char ** parts[BT_MAX_NAMEPARTS];
                 int     part_len[BT_MAX_NAMEPARTS];
              } bt_name;

           Again,  there's  no  nice  interface  to  this  structure;  you'll  just  have  to  access the fields
           individually.  They are:

           "tokens"
               the name, broken down into  a  flat  list  of  tokens.   See  above  for  a  description  of  the
               "bt_stringlist" structure.

           "parts"
               an  array  of  arrays  of pointers into the token list.  The major dimension of this beast is the
               "name part;" you should index  this  dimension  using  the  "bt_namepart"  enum.   For  instance,
               "parts[BTN_LAST]"   is   an   array   of  pointers  to  the  tokens  comprising  the  last  name;
               "parts[BTN_LAST][1]"  is  a  "char   *":   the   second   token   of   the   'last'   part;   and
               "parts[BTN_LAST][1][0]" is the first character of the second token of the 'last' part.

           "part_len"
               the length, in tokens, of each part.  For instance, you might loop over all tokens in the 'first'
               part as follows (assuming "name" is a "bt_name *" returned by bt_split_name()):

                  for (i = 0; i &lt; name-&gt;part_len[BTN_FIRST]; i++)
                  {
                     printf ("token %d of first name: %s\n",
                             i, name-&gt;parts[BTN_FIRST][i]);
                  }

       <b>bt_free_name()</b>
              void bt_free_name (bt_name * name)

           Frees  the  "bt_name"  structure  created by bt_split_name() (including the "bt_stringlist" structure
           inside the "bt_name").
