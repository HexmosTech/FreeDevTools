       explain_mkdir - explain <a href="../man2/mkdir.2.html">mkdir</a>(2) errors

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;libexplain/mkdir.h&gt;
       const char *explain_mkdir(const char *pathname);
       const char *explain_errno_mkdir(int errnum, const char *pathname);
       void explain_message_mkdir(char *message, int message_size, const char *pathname);
       void explain_message_errno_mkdir(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, const char *pathname);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These functions may be used to obtain explanations for errors returned by the <u><a href="../man2/mkdir.2.html">mkdir</a></u>(2) system call.

   <b>explain_mkdir</b>
       const char *explain_mkdir(const char *pathname);

       The  <b>explain_mkdir</b>  function is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the <u><a href="../man2/mkdir.2.html">mkdir</a></u>(2) system
       call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it  will  do  much
       better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (mkdir(pathname) &lt; 0)
              {
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_mkdir(pathname));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>pathname</u>
               The original pathname, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/mkdir.2.html">mkdir</a></u>(2) system call.

       Returns:
               The  message  explaining  the  error.   This message buffer is shared by all libexplain functions
               which do not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the  next  call
               to any libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b>  This  function  is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all threads, and many
       other functions in this library.

   <b>explain_errno_mkdir</b>
       const char *explain_errno_mkdir(int errnum, const char *pathname);

       The <b>explain_errno_mkdir</b> function is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned  by  the  <u><a href="../man2/mkdir.2.html">mkdir</a></u>(2)
       system call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errnum), but usually it will do
       much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (mkdir(pathname) &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_errno_mkdir(err, pathname));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>errnum</u>  The  error  value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just before this
               function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <u>pathname</u>
               The original pathname, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/mkdir.2.html">mkdir</a></u>(2) system call.

       Returns:
               The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is  shared  by  all  libexplain  functions
               which  do  not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the next call
               to any libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b> This function is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all  threads,  and  many
       other functions in this library.

   <b>explain_message_mkdir</b>
       void explain_message_mkdir(char *message, int message_size, const char *pathname);

       The  <b>explain_message_mkdir</b>  function  may  be  used to  obtain an explanation of an error returned by the
       <u><a href="../man2/mkdir.2.html">mkdir</a></u>(2) system call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it
       will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (mkdir(pathname) &lt; 0)
              {
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_mkdir(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), pathname);
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>message</u> The location in which to store the returned message.  If a  suitable  message  return  buffer  is
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>pathname</u>
               The original pathname, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/mkdir.2.html">mkdir</a></u>(2) system call.

   <b>explain_message_errno_mkdir</b>
       void explain_message_errno_mkdir(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, const char *pathname);

       The <b>explain_message_errno_mkdir</b> function may be used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the
       <u><a href="../man2/mkdir.2.html">mkdir</a></u>(2)  system  call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errnum), but usually
       it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (mkdir(pathname) &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_errno_mkdir(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), err, pathname);
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>message</u> The location in which to store the returned message.  If a  suitable  message  return  buffer  is
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>errnum</u>  The  error  value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just before this
