       explain_access - explain <a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a>(2) errors

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;libexplain/access.h&gt;
       const char *explain_access(const char *pathname, int mode);
       const char *explain_errno_access(int errnum, const char *pathname, int mode);
       void explain_message_access(char *message, int message_size, const char *pathname, int mode);
       void  explain_message_errno_access(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, const char *pathname, int
       mode);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These functions may be used to obtain explanations for <u><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></u>(2) errors.

   <b>explain_access</b>
       const char *explain_access(const char *pathname, int mode);

       The explain_access function is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the <u><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></u>(2) system
       call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it  will  do  much
       better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              int fd = access(pathname, mode);
              if (fd &lt; 0)
              {
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s0, explain_access(pathname, mode));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>pathname</u>
               The original pathname, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>mode</u>    The  original  mode,  exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></u>(2) system call.  TP 8n Returns: The message
               explaining the error.  This message buffer is shared by all libexplain  functions  which  do  not
               supply  a  buffer  in  their  argument  list.   This  will be overwritten by the next call to any
               libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b> This function is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all  threads,  and  many
       other functions in this library.

   <b>explain_errno_access</b>
       const char *explain_errno_access(int errnum, const char *pathname, int mode);

       The  explain_errno_access function is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the <u><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></u>(2)
       system call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errnum), but usually it will do
       much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              int fd = access(pathname, mode);
              if (fd &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s0, explain_errno_access(err, pathname,
                      mode));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>errnum</u>  The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just  before  this
               function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <u>pathname</u>
               The original pathname, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>mode</u>    The original mode, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></u>(2) system call.

       Returns:
               The  message  explaining  the  error.   This message buffer is shared by all libexplain functions
               which do not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the  next  call
               to any libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b>  This  function  is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all threads, and many
       other functions in this library.

   <b>explain_message_access</b>
       void explain_message_access(char *message, int message_size, const char *pathname, int mode);

       The explain_message_access function is used to  obtain  an  explanation  of  an  error  returned  by  the
       <u><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></u>(2)  system  call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually
       it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              int fd = access(pathname, mode);
              if (fd &lt; 0)
              {
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_access(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), pathname,
                      mode);
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s0, message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>message</u> The location in which to store the returned message.  Because a message return  buffer  has  been
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>pathname</u>
               The original pathname, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>mode</u>    The original mode, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></u>(2) system call.

   <b>explain_message_errno_access</b>
       void  explain_message_errno_access(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, const char *pathname, int
       mode);

       The explain_message_errno_access function is used to obtain an explanation of an error  returned  by  the
       <u><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></u>(2)  system call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errnum), but usually
       it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following exameple:
              int fd = access(pathname, mode);
              if (fd &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_errno_access(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), err,
                      pathname, mode);
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s0, message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>message</u> The location in which to store the returned message.  Because a message return  buffer  has  been
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>errnum</u>  The  error  value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just before this
               function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <u>pathname</u>
               The original pathname, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>mode</u>    The original mode, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></u>(2) system call.
