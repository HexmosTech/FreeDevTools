</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cdk_compat - <u>Cdk4</u> compatibility functions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cc</b> [ <u>flag</u> ... ] <u>file</u> ...  <b>-lcdk</b> [ <u>library</u> ... ]

       #include &lt;cdk_compat.h&gt;

       <b>int</b> <b>getDirectoryContents</b> <b>(</b>
                      <b>char</b> <b>*directory</b><u>,</u>
                      <b>char</b> <b>**list</b><u>,</u>
                      <b>int</b> <u>maxListSize</u><b>);</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>readFile</b> <b>(</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b><u>filename</u><b>,</b>
                      <b>char</b> <b>**</b><u>info</u><b>,</b>
                      <b>int</b> <u>maxlines</u><b>);</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>splitString</b> <b>(</b>
                      <b>char</b> <b>*</b><u>string</u><b>,</b>
                      <b>char</b> <b>**</b><u>items</u><b>,</b>
                      <b>char</b> <u>splitChar</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These functions and macros make it simpler to port applications from the older Cdk4 library to Cdk5.

       A  few functions are deprecated in Cdk5, because they rely upon the caller to know in advance the size of
       data which will be returned by the function.

       Additionally, some macros are deprecated because they  serve  no  realistic  purpose:  they  have  direct
       (standard) equivalents in all modern curses implementations.

       Finally,  a  few  macro  definitions  are added to iron out naming inconsistencies across the Cdk4 header
       files.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABLE</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>getDirectoryContents</b>
            This opens the current directory and reads the contents.  Use <b>CDKgetDirectoryContents()</b> in new code.

       <b>readFile</b>
            This reads a file and sticks it into the <b>char</b> <b>**</b> provided.  Use <b>CDKreadFile()</b> for new code.

       <b>splitString</b>
            This splits a string into one or more parts given the split character.  Use <b>CDKsplitString()</b> for new
            code.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Start the porting process by changing the <b>#include</b>'s to use
              #include &lt;cdk_compat.h&gt;

       rather than
              #include &lt;cdk.h&gt;
       Some adjustments of course are needed to make  your  compiler  see  the  compatibility  header  file.   A
       separate  name  was  chosen so that it in turn can (by adjusting the include path) include either the old
       Cdk4 <b>cdk.h</b> or the new.  If the old is included, you should link your program  against  the  old  library.
       Likewise, including the new requires that you link against the new library.

       That  is  the  first  step: making your program compile using the compatibility header file using the old
       headers and library.

       The next step is to get it to compile against the new headers and library.   Most  of  the  changes  will
       require  modifying  bare  references  to  certain  pointers  to wrap them with the <b>ObjOf()</b> and <b>ScreenOf()</b>
       macros.  New Cdk uses these to provide functions which are  easily  shared  among  the  different  widget
       types.   Your  compiler  should  be  able  to tell you where the changes should be made.  See the example
       programs which are included with Cdk as a guide.

       That is the hard part of porting.  But even for a large program, the changes can be  made  simply:  there
       are  not  that  many types of change to make.  At the end of this step, you should still be able to build
       and run your program against the old headers and library.  It is reasonably likely that you  can  do  the
       same  with  the  new  headers and library.  By using the same source for old/new versions of Cdk, you can
       test and verify that your program still works properly after these modifications.

       Finally, unless this is a purely academic exercise, you will want to remove references to the  deprecated
       functions and macros.
