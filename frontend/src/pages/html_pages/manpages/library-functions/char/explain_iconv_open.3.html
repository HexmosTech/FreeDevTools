       #include &lt;libexplain/iconv_open.h&gt;
       const char *explain_iconv_open(const char *tocode, const char *fromcode);
       const char *explain_errno_iconv_open(int errnum, const char *tocode, const char *fromcode);
       void explain_message_iconv_open(char *message, int message_size, const char *tocode, const char
       *fromcode);
       void explain_message_errno_iconv_open(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, const char *tocode,
       const char *fromcode);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These functions may be used to obtain explanations for errors returned by the <u><a href="../man3/iconv_open.3.html">iconv_open</a></u>(3) system call.

   <b>explain_iconv_open</b>
       const char *explain_iconv_open(const char *tocode, const char *fromcode);

       The  <b>explain_iconv_open</b>  function  is  used  to  obtain  an  explanation  of  an  error  returned  by the
       <u><a href="../man3/iconv_open.3.html">iconv_open</a></u>(3) system call. The least the message will  contain  is  the  value  of  strerror(errno),  but
       usually it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       <u>tocode</u>  The original tocode, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/iconv_open.3.html">iconv_open</a></u>(3) system call.

       <u>fromcode</u>
               The original fromcode, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/iconv_open.3.html">iconv_open</a></u>(3) system call.

       Returns:
               The message explaining the error. This message buffer is shared by all libexplain functions which
               do  not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to any
               libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b> This function is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all  threads,  and  many
       other functions in this library.

       <b>Example:</b> This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              iconv_t result = iconv_open(tocode, fromcode);
              if (result &lt; 0)
              {
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_iconv_open(tocode, fromcode));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre-packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_iconv_open_or_die.3.html">explain_iconv_open_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

   <b>explain_errno_iconv_open</b>
       const char *explain_errno_iconv_open(int errnum, const char *tocode, const char *fromcode);

       The  <b>explain_errno_iconv_open</b>  function  is  used  to  obtain  an explanation of an error returned by the
       <u><a href="../man3/iconv_open.3.html">iconv_open</a></u>(3) system call.  The least the message will contain  is  the  value  of  strerror(errno),  but
       usually it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       <u>errnum</u>  The  error  value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just before this
               function is called. This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to  be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <u>tocode</u>  The original tocode, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/iconv_open.3.html">iconv_open</a></u>(3) system call.

       <u>fromcode</u>
               The original fromcode, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/iconv_open.3.html">iconv_open</a></u>(3) system call.

       Returns:
               The message explaining the error. This message buffer is shared by all libexplain functions which
               do  not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to any
               libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b> This function is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all  threads,  and  many
       other functions in this library.

       <b>Example:</b> This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              iconv_t result = iconv_open(tocode, fromcode);
              if (result &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_errno_iconv_open(err, tocode, fromcode));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre-packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_iconv_open_or_die.3.html">explain_iconv_open_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

   <b>explain_message_iconv_open</b>
       void explain_message_iconv_open(char *message, int message_size, const char *tocode, const char
       *fromcode);

       The  <b>explain_message_iconv_open</b>  function  is  used  to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the
       <u><a href="../man3/iconv_open.3.html">iconv_open</a></u>(3) system call.  The least the message will contain  is  the  value  of  strerror(errno),  but
       usually it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       <u>message</u> The  location  in  which  to  store  the returned message. If a suitable message return buffer is
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>tocode</u>  The original tocode, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/iconv_open.3.html">iconv_open</a></u>(3) system call.

       <u>fromcode</u>
               The original fromcode, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/iconv_open.3.html">iconv_open</a></u>(3) system call.

       <b>Example:</b> This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              iconv_t result = iconv_open(tocode, fromcode);
              if (result &lt; 0)
              {
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_iconv_open(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), tocode, fromcode);
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre-packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_iconv_open_or_die.3.html">explain_iconv_open_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

   <b>explain_message_errno_iconv_open</b>
       void explain_message_errno_iconv_open(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, const char *tocode,
       const char *fromcode);

       The <b>explain_message_errno_iconv_open</b> function is used to obtain an explanation of an  error  returned  by
       the  <u><a href="../man3/iconv_open.3.html">iconv_open</a></u>(3)  system call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but
       usually it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       <u>message</u> The location in which to store the returned message. If  a  suitable  message  return  buffer  is
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>errnum</u>  The  error  value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just before this
               function is called. This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to  be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <u>fromcode</u>
               The original fromcode, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/iconv_open.3.html">iconv_open</a></u>(3) system call.

       <b>Example:</b> This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              iconv_t result = iconv_open(tocode, fromcode);
              if (result &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_errno_iconv_open(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), err, tocode, fromcode);
