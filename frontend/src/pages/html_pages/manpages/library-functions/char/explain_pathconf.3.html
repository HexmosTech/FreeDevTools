       explain_pathconf - explain <a href="../man3/pathconf.3.html">pathconf</a>(3) errors

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;libexplain/pathconf.h&gt;
       const char *explain_pathconf(const char *pathname, int name);
       const char *explain_errno_pathconf(int errnum, const char *pathname, int name);
       void explain_message_pathconf(char *message, int message_size, const char *pathname, int name);
       void  explain_message_errno_pathconf(char  *message,  int message_size, int errnum, const char *pathname,
       int name);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These functions may be used to obtain explanations for errors returned by the <u><a href="../man3/pathconf.3.html">pathconf</a></u>(3) system call.

   <b>explain_pathconf</b>
       const char *explain_pathconf(const char *pathname, int name);

       The <b>explain_pathconf</b> function is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned  by  the  <u><a href="../man3/pathconf.3.html">pathconf</a></u>(3)
       system  call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it will do
       much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (pathconf(pathname, name) &lt; 0)
              {
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_pathconf(pathname, name));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre‐packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_pathconf_or_die.3.html">explain_pathconf_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

       <u>pathname</u>
               The original pathname, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/pathconf.3.html">pathconf</a></u>(3) system call.

       <u>name</u>    The original name, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/pathconf.3.html">pathconf</a></u>(3) system call.

       Returns:
               The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is  shared  by  all  libexplain  functions
               which  do  not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the next call
               to any libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b> This function is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all  threads,  and  many
       other functions in this library.

   <b>explain_errno_pathconf</b>
       const char *explain_errno_pathconf(int errnum, const char *pathname, int name);

       The  <b>explain_errno_pathconf</b>  function  is  used  to  obtain  an  explanation  of an error returned by the
       <u><a href="../man3/pathconf.3.html">pathconf</a></u>(3) system call.  The least the message will  contain  is  the  value  of  strerror(errnum),  but
       usually it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (pathconf(pathname, name) &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_errno_pathconf(err, pathname, name));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre‐packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_pathconf_or_die.3.html">explain_pathconf_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

       <u>errnum</u>  The  error  value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just before this
               function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <u>pathname</u>
               The original pathname, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/pathconf.3.html">pathconf</a></u>(3) system call.

       <u>name</u>    The original name, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/pathconf.3.html">pathconf</a></u>(3) system call.

       Returns:
               The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is  shared  by  all  libexplain  functions
               which  do  not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the next call
               to any libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b> This function is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all  threads,  and  many
       other functions in this library.

   <b>explain_message_pathconf</b>
       void explain_message_pathconf(char *message, int message_size, const char *pathname, int name);

       The  <b>explain_message_pathconf</b>  function may be used to  obtain an explanation of an error returned by the
       <u><a href="../man3/pathconf.3.html">pathconf</a></u>(3) system call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually
       it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (pathconf(pathname, name) &lt; 0)
              {
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_pathconf(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), pathname, name);
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre‐packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_pathconf_or_die.3.html">explain_pathconf_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

       <u>message</u> The location in which to store the returned message.  If a  suitable  message  return  buffer  is
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>pathname</u>
               The original pathname, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/pathconf.3.html">pathconf</a></u>(3) system call.

       <u>name</u>    The original name, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/pathconf.3.html">pathconf</a></u>(3) system call.

   <b>explain_message_errno_pathconf</b>
       void  explain_message_errno_pathconf(char  *message,  int message_size, int errnum, const char *pathname,
       int name);

       The <b>explain_message_errno_pathconf</b> function may be used to obtain an explanation of an error returned  by
       the  <u><a href="../man3/pathconf.3.html">pathconf</a></u>(3)  system  call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errnum), but
       usually it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (pathconf(pathname, name) &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_errno_pathconf(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), err,
                      pathname, name);
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre‐packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_pathconf_or_die.3.html">explain_pathconf_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

       <u>message</u> The location in which to store the returned message.  If a  suitable  message  return  buffer  is
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>errnum</u>  The  error  value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just before this
               function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <u>pathname</u>
               The original pathname, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/pathconf.3.html">pathconf</a></u>(3) system call.

       <u>name</u>    The original name, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/pathconf.3.html">pathconf</a></u>(3) system call.
