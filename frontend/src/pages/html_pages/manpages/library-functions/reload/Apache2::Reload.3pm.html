         1;

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       "Apache2::Reload" reloads modules that change on the disk.

       When Perl pulls a file via "require", it stores the filename in the global hash %INC.  The next time Perl
       tries to "require" the same file, it sees the file in %INC and does not reload from disk.  This module's
       handler can be configured to iterate over the modules in %INC and reload those that have changed on disk
       or only specific modules that have registered themselves with "Apache2::Reload". It can also do the check
       for modified modules, when a special touch-file has been modified.

       Require-hooks, i.e., entries in %INC which are references, are ignored.  The hook should modify %INC
       itself, adding the path to the module file, for it to be reloaded.

       "Apache2::Reload" inspects and reloads the <b>file</b> associated with a given module.  Changes to @INC are not
       recognized, as it is the file which is being re-required, not the module name.

       In version 0.10 and earlier the <b>module</b> <b>name</b>, not the file, is re-required.  Meaning it operated on the
       the current context of @INC.  If you still want this behavior set this environment variable in
       <u>httpd.conf</u>:

         PerlSetVar ReloadByModuleName On

       This means, when called as a "Perl*Handler", "Apache2::Reload" will not see @INC paths added or removed
       by "ModPerl::Registry" scripts, as the value of @INC is saved on server startup and restored to that
       value after each request.  In other words, if you want "Apache2::Reload" to work with modules that live
       in custom @INC paths, you should modify @INC when the server is started.  Besides, 'use lib' in the
       startup script, you can also set the "PERL5LIB" variable in the httpd's environment to include any non-
       standard 'lib' directories that you choose.  For example, to accomplish that you can include a line:

         PERL5LIB=/home/httpd/perl/extra; export PERL5LIB

       in the script that starts Apache. Alternatively, you can set this environment variable in <u>httpd.conf</u>:

         PerlSetEnv PERL5LIB /home/httpd/perl/extra

   <b>Monitor</b> <b>All</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>in</b> <b>%INC</b>
       To monitor and reload all modules in %INC at the beginning of request's processing, simply add the
       following configuration to your <u>httpd.conf</u>:

         PerlModule Apache2::Reload
         PerlInitHandler Apache2::Reload

       When working with connection filters and protocol modules "Apache2::Reload" should be invoked in the
       pre_connection stage:

         PerlPreConnectionHandler Apache2::Reload

       See also the discussion on "PerlPreConnectionHandler".

   <b>Register</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>Implicitly</b>
       To only reload modules that have registered with "Apache2::Reload", add the following to the <u>httpd.conf</u>:

         PerlModule Apache2::Reload
         PerlInitHandler Apache2::Reload
         PerlSetVar ReloadAll Off
         # ReloadAll defaults to On

       Then any modules with the line:

         use Apache2::Reload;

       Will be reloaded when they change.

   <b>Register</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>Explicitly</b>
       You can also register modules explicitly in your <u>httpd.conf</u> file that you want to be reloaded on change:

         PerlModule Apache2::Reload
         PerlInitHandler Apache2::Reload
         PerlSetVar ReloadAll Off
         PerlSetVar ReloadModules "My::Foo My::Bar Foo::Bar::Test"

       Note that these are split on whitespace, but the module list <b>must</b> be in quotes, otherwise Apache tries to
       parse the parameter list.

       The "*" wild character can be used to register groups of files under the same namespace. For example the
       setting:

         PerlSetVar ReloadModules "ModPerl::* Apache2::*"

       will monitor all modules under the namespaces "ModPerl::" and "Apache2::".

   <b>Monitor</b> <b>Only</b> <b>Certain</b> <b>Sub</b> <b>Directories</b>
       To reload modules only in certain directories (and their subdirectories) add the following to the
       <u>httpd.conf</u>:

         PerlModule Apache2::Reload
         PerlInitHandler Apache2::Reload
         PerlSetVar ReloadDirectories "/tmp/project1 /tmp/project2"

       You can further narrow the list of modules to be reloaded from the chosen directories with
       "ReloadModules" as in:

         PerlModule Apache2::Reload
         PerlInitHandler Apache2::Reload
         PerlSetVar ReloadDirectories "/tmp/project1 /tmp/project2"
         PerlSetVar ReloadAll Off
         PerlSetVar ReloadModules "MyApache2::*"

       In this configuration example only modules from the namespace "MyApache2::" found in the directories
       <u>/tmp/project1/</u> and <u>/tmp/project2/</u> (and their subdirectories) will be reloaded.

   <b>Special</b> <b>"Touch"</b> <b>File</b>
       You can also declare a file, which when gets <a href="../man1/touch.1.html">touch</a>(1)ed, causes the reloads to be performed. For example
       if you set:

         PerlSetVar ReloadTouchFile /tmp/reload_modules

       and don't <a href="../man1/touch.1.html">touch</a>(1) the file <u>/tmp/reload_modules</u>, the reloads won't happen until you go to the command
       line and type:

         % touch /tmp/reload_modules

       When you do that, the modules that have been changed, will be magically reloaded on the next request.
       This option works with any mode described before.

   <b>Unregistering</b> <b>a</b> <b>module</b>
       In some cases, it might be necessary to explicitly stop reloading a module.

         Apache2::Reload-&gt;unregister_module('Some::Module');

       But be careful, since unregistering a module in this way will only do so for the current interpreter.
       This feature should be used with care.

</pre><h4><b>Performance</b> <b>Issues</b></h4><pre>
       This module is perfectly suited for a development environment. Though it's possible that you would like
       to use it in a production environment, since with "Apache2::Reload" you don't have to restart the server
       in order to reload changed modules during software updates. Though this convenience comes at a price:

       •   If the "touch" file feature is used, "Apache2::Reload" has to <b><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></b>(2) the touch file on each request,
           which   adds   a  slight  but  most  likely  insignificant  overhead  to  response  times.  Otherwise
           "Apache2::Reload" will <b><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></b>(2) each registered module or even worse--all modules in %INC, which  will
           significantly slow everything down.

       •   Once  the  child process reloads the modules, the memory used by these modules is not shared with the
           parent process anymore. Therefore the memory consumption may grow significantly.

       Therefore doing a full server stop and restart is probably a better solution.

</pre><h4><b>Debug</b></h4><pre>
       If you aren't sure whether the modules that are supposed to be reloaded, are actually  getting  reloaded,
       turn the debug mode on:

         PerlSetVar ReloadDebug On

</pre><h4><b>Caveats</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Problems</b> <b>With</b> <b>Reloading</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>Which</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Declare</b> <b>Their</b> <b>Package</b> <b>Name</b>
       If you modify modules, which don't declare their "package", and rely on "Apache2::Reload" to reload them,
       you may encounter problems: i.e., it'll appear as if the module wasn't reloaded when in fact it was. This
       happens  because  when  "Apache2::Reload" "require()"s such a module all the global symbols end up in the
       "Apache2::Reload" namespace!  So the module does get reloaded and you see  the  compile  time  errors  if
       there  are  any,  but the symbols don't get imported to the right namespace. Therefore the old version of
       the code is running.

   <b>Failing</b> <b>to</b> <b>Find</b> <b>a</b> <b>File</b> <b>to</b> <b>Reload</b>
       "Apache2::Reload" uses %INC to find the files on the filesystem. If an entry for a  certain  filepath  in
       %INC is relative, "Apache2::Reload" will use @INC to try to resolve that relative path. Now remember that
       mod_perl  freezes the value of @INC at the server startup, and you can modify it only for the duration of
       one request when you need to load some module which is not in on of the @INC  directories.  So  a  module
       gets  loaded,  and registered in %INC with a relative path. Now when "Apache2::Reload" tries to find that
       module to check whether it has been modified, it can't find since  its  directory  is  not  in  @INC.  So
       "Apache2::Reload" will silently skip that module.

       You can enable the "Debug|/Debug" mode to see what "Apache2::Reload" does behind the scenes.

   <b>Problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>Scripts</b> <b>Running</b> <b>with</b> <b>Registry</b> <b>Handlers</b> <b>that</b> <b>Cache</b> <b>the</b> <b>Code</b>
       The  following  problem is relevant only to registry handlers that cache the compiled script. For example
       it concerns "ModPerl::Registry" but not "ModPerl::PerlRun".

       <u>The</u> <u>Problem</u>

       Let's say that there is a module "My::Utils":

         #file:My/Utils.pm
         #----------------
         package My::Utils;
         BEGIN { warn __PACKAGE__ , " was reloaded\n" }
         use base qw(Exporter);
         @EXPORT = qw(colour);
         sub colour { "white" }
         1;

       And a registry script <u>test.pl</u>:

         #file:test.pl
         #------------
         use My::Utils;
         print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";
         print "the color is " . colour();

       Assuming that the server is running in a single mode, we request the script for the first time and we get
       the response:

         the color is white

       Now we change <u>My/Utils.pm</u>:

         -  sub colour { "white" }
         +  sub colour { "red" }

       And issue the request again. "Apache2::Reload" does its job and we can see that "My::Utils" was  reloaded
       (look in the <u>error_log</u> file). However the script still returns:

         the color is white

       <u>The</u> <u>Explanation</u>

       Even  though  <u>My/Utils.pm</u>  was  reloaded,  "ModPerl::Registry"'s cached code won't run '"use My::Utils;"'
       again (since it happens only once, i.e. during the compile time). Therefore the script doesn't know  that
       the subroutine reference has been changed.

       This is easy to verify. Let's change the script to be:

         #file:test.pl
         #------------
         use My::Utils;
         print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";
         my $sub_int = \&amp;colour;
         my $sub_ext = \&amp;My::Utils::colour;
         print "int $sub_int\n";
         print "ext $sub_ext\n";

       Issue a request, you will see something similar to:

         int <a href="../man0x8510af8/CODE.0x8510af8.html">CODE</a>(0x8510af8)
         ext <a href="../man0x8510af8/CODE.0x8510af8.html">CODE</a>(0x8510af8)

       As you can see both point to the same CODE reference (meaning that it's the same symbol). After modifying
       <u>My/Utils.pm</u> again:

         -  sub colour { "red" }
         +  sub colour { "blue" }

       and calling the script on the secondnd time, we get:

         int <a href="../man0x8510af8/CODE.0x8510af8.html">CODE</a>(0x8510af8)
         ext <a href="../man0x851112c/CODE.0x851112c.html">CODE</a>(0x851112c)

       You can see that the internal CODE reference is not the same as the external one.

       <u>The</u> <u>Solution</u>

       There are two solutions to this problem:

       Solution 1: replace "use()" with an explicit "require()" + "import()".

        - use My::Utils;
        + require My::Utils; My::Utils-&gt;import();

       now the changed functions will be reimported on every request.

       Solution 2: remember to touch the script itself every time you change the module that it requires.

</pre><h4><b>Threaded</b> <b>MPM</b> <b>and</b> <b>Multiple</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>Interpreters</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  use  "Apache2::Reload"  with  a threaded MPM and multiple Perl interpreters, the modules will be
       reloaded by each interpreter as they are used, not every interpreters at once.  Similar to  mod_perl  1.0
       where  each  child  has  its  own  Perl interpreter, the modules are reloaded as each child is hit with a
       request.

       If a module is loaded at startup, the syntax tree of each subroutine is shared between interpreters  (big
       win),  but  each  subroutine  has  its  own  padlist  (where  lexical  my  variables  are  stored).  Once
       "Apache2::Reload" reloads a module, this sharing goes away and each Perl interpreter will  have  its  own
       copy of the syntax tree for the reloaded subroutines.

</pre><h4><b>Pseudo-hashes</b></h4><pre>
       The short summary of this is: Don't use pseudo-hashes. They are deprecated since Perl 5.8 and are removed
       in 5.9.

       Use  an  array with constant indexes. Its faster in the general case, its more guaranteed, and generally,
       it works.

       The long summary is that some work has been done to get this module working with modules that use pseudo-
       hashes, but it's still broken in the case of a single module that contains multiple packages that all use
       pseudo-hashes.

       So don't do that.
