       EZMAP - Allows one to plot maps of the earth according to any of ten different projections, with
       parallels, meridians, and continental, international, and/or U.S. state outlines.

       EZMAPA is the name of a supplement to the EZMAP utility that allows users to produce solid-filled maps of
       the earth.  The EZMAPA routines are discussed as part of the EZMAP utility.

       EZMAPB is the name of a supplement to the EZMAP utility that provides access to improved map databases
       (principally one called "Earth..1", which contains a unified higher-resolution version of everything that
       was in the old outline datasets).  The EZMAPB routines are discussed as part of the EZMAP utility.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Routines Used to Draw a Simple Map

              To  draw  the simple map defined by the current values of EZMAP's internal parameters (assuming no
              area fills and no access to the new, improved, map  database  "Earth..1",  which  was  created  in
              1998), one need only execute the single FORTRAN statement "CALL MAPDRW":

              •   MAPDRW - Draws a complete simple map.

              All  that  MAPDRW does is call four lower-level routines. In some situations, the user may wish to
              call these routines directly; they are as follows (in the  order  in  which  they  are  called  by
              MAPDRW):

              •   MAPINT  -  Initializes.  MAPINT  must  be called at least once before calling any routine that
                  depends on mapping lat/lon coordinates into u/v coordinates. After  one  or  more  of  MAPPOS,
                  MAPROJ,  and  MAPSET has been called, MAPINT must be called again. MAPINT does the call to the
                  SPPS routine SET that defines the mapping from the u/v (projection) plane to the x/y (plotter)
                  plane.

              •   MAPGRD - Draws selected parallels and meridians.

              •   MAPLBL - Labels the international date line, the equator,  the  Greenwich  meridian,  and  the
                  poles, and draws the perimeter.

              •   MAPLOT  -  Draws  selected  geographic  outlines.   Note  that this routine uses whichever old
                  outline dataset is selected by the value of the internal parameter 'OU'; to access the new map
                  database "Earth..1", which was created in 1998, one  must  call  instead  the  EZMAPB  routine
                  MPLNDR.

       Routines Used to Change the Values of Internal Parameters

              The  following  routines are called to change the values of internal parameters of EZMAP, and thus
              change the behavior of other EZMAP routines:

              •   MAPPOS - Determines what portion of the plotter frame is to be used.

              •   MAPROJ - Determines the projection to be used.

              •   MAPSET - Determines what portion of the u/v plane is to be viewed.

              •   MAPSTC - Sets a parameter value of type CHARACTER.

              •   MAPSTI - Sets a parameter value of type INTEGER.

              •   MAPSTL - Sets a parameter value of type LOGICAL.

              •   MAPSTR - Sets a parameter value of type REAL.

       Routines Used to Retrieve the Values of Internal Parameters

              The following routines are used to retrieve the current values of EZMAP parameters:

              •   MAPGTC - Gets a parameter value of type CHARACTER.

              •   MAPGTI - Gets a parameter value of type INTEGER.

              •   MAPGTL - Gets a parameter value of type LOGICAL.

              •   MAPGTR - Gets a parameter value of type REAL.

       Routines Used to Save and Restore Internal Parameters

              To save/restore the current values of the internal parameters of EZMAP, use the following:

              •   MAPSAV - Saves the values (by writing a record on a user-specified unit).

              •   MAPRST - Restores saved values (by reading a record from a user-specified unit).

       Routines Used to Draw Objects on a Map

              To draw objects on the map, use the following routines:

              •   MAPTRA - Computes the u/v coordinates of a point from its latitude and longitude. If the point
                  is unprojectable or its projection lies outside the current  perimeter,  a  special  value  is
                  returned to signal this.

              •   MAPTRN - Computes the u/v coordinates of a point from its latitude and longitude. If the point
                  is  unprojectable,  a  special  value is returned to signal this, but no check is made for the
                  projected value being outside the perimeter.

              •   MAPFST - Does a "pen-up" move defining the start of a line to be projected and drawn. The line
                  is defined by a series of lat/lon coordinates.

              •   MAPVEC - Does a "pen-down" move defining the continuation of a line to be projected and drawn.
                  The line is defined by a series of lat/lon coordinates.

              •   MAPIT - Does "pen-up" or "pen-down" moves. This routine is called by MAPFST and MAPVEC.

              •   MAPIQ - Signals the end of a string of calls to MAPIT and causes its buffers to be flushed.

              •   MAPGCI - Given the latitudes and longitudes of two points on the surface of  the  globe,  this
                  routine  returns  the latitudes and longitudes of a specified number of points along the great
                  circle route joining them.

       Routines Used to Do Inverse Transformations

              The following routine was added to EZMAP early in 1992:

              •   MAPTRI - Computes the latitude and longitude of a point from its u/v coordinates. If the point
                  is outside the boundary of the map, a special value is returned.

              The example named "mpex10" shows one of the ways in which this routine may be used; it draws  what
              is  essentially  a colored contour plot of a data field defined on the surface of the globe, using
              an orthographic projection.

       Routines Used to Draw Solid-Filled Maps (EZMAPA)

              In late 1986 or early 1987, a package of routines was written allowing a user to draw solid-filled
              maps of the globe. This package was named EZMAPA and was first advertised  in  the  NCAR  Graphics
              User's Guide (Version 2.00), published in August, 1987. Conceptually, the routines in this package
              are  really  part  of  EZMAP; they use the same common blocks and many of the same underlying low-
              level routines and they are affected by the same set of internal parameters  as  the  routines  in
              EZMAP proper.  The routines of EZMAPA will be described in this document; to use them effectively,
              it  will  be  necessary  to  understand  also  the package AREAS, which is described in a separate
              document. The EZMAPA routines are as follows:

              •   MAPBLA - Adds boundary lines to an existing area map. Routines in the package AREAS  may  then
                  be used to process that area map in various ways.  (Example: drawing a map of Europe with each
                  country  in  a different color.)  Note that this routine uses whichever old outline dataset is
                  selected by the value of  the  internal  parameter  'OU';  to  access  the  new  map  database
                  "Earth..1", which was created in 1998, one must call instead the EZMAPB routine MPLNAM.

              •   MAPBLM - Draws boundary lines "masked" by an existing area map.  (Example: drawing these lines
                  only  where  they  do not overlay CONPACK labels.)   Note that this routine uses whichever old
                  outline dataset is selected by the value of the internal parameter 'OU'; to access the new map
                  database "Earth..1", which was created in 1998, one  must  call  instead  the  EZMAPB  routine
                  MPLNDM.

              •   MAPGRM  -  Draws  lines  of latitude and longitude "masked" by an existing area map. (Example:
                  drawing these lines over water, but not over land.)

              •   MAPITA and MAPIQA - Adds to an area map the projections of arbitrary lines defined by  lat/lon
                  coordinates  of points on the surface of the globe. MAPBLA uses these routines to add boundary
                  lines to an area map; they may be called directly by the  user  to  add  his/her  own  set  of
                  boundary lines to the area map.

              •   MAPITM  and  MAPIQM - Draws, masked by an area map, the projections of arbitrary lines defined
                  by lat/lon coordinates of points on the surface of the globe. MAPGRM uses  these  routines  to
                  draw  masked  lines of latitude and longitude; they may be called directly by the user to draw
                  other masked lines.

              •   MAPACI - A function which, given the "area identifier" for a particular area  defined  by  the
                  boundaries  in one of the old EZMAP outline datasets, returns a suggested color index for that
                  area; it is guaranteed that, if the suggested color indices are used, no two  areas  having  a
                  boundary  in  common  will have the same color.  Note that this function should not be used to
                  select color indices for areas defined by the new map database "Earth..1", which  was  created
                  in 1998; for that purpose, use EZMAPB functions instead (in particular, MPISCI).

       Routines Used to Access New Datasets (EZMAPB)

              In  early  1998, a new world map database, called "Earth..1", was created for use with EZMAP; this
              database has higher-resolution coastlines, it has been updated to reflect many  of  the  political
              changes that have taken place over the years since EZMAP came into existence, and it is structured
              differently, allowing for greater flexibility and ease of use and providing for easier changes and
              extensions in the future.

              Each area defined by the database has 1) a "area identifier" (an integer uniquely identifying it),
              2)  an "area type" specifying its level in a hierarchy of areas, 3) a suggested color index, 4) an
              area identifier specifying its "parent" area (the area of which it is a part), and 5) a name.  For
              example, there is an area named "Madeline Island" which is of type  4  (used  for  a  state  or  a
              portion  thereof) and has suggested color index 6.  Its parent is an area named "Wisconsin", which
              is also of type 4 and has suggested color index 6.  The parent  of  "Wisconsin"  is  "Conterminous
              US", which is of type 3 (used for a country or a portion thereof) and has suggested color index 3.
              The  parent  of  "Conterminous  US"  is "United States", which is also of type 3 and has suggested
              color index 3.  The parent of "United States" is "North America", which  is  of  type  2  and  has
              suggested  color  index  5.   The  parent of "North America" is "Land", which is of type 1 and has
              suggested color index 2.  The area named "Land" is at the top of the hierarchy and  therefore  has
              no parent (when you ask for the area identifier of its parent, you get a zero).

              One  may  use  the  database  at  any of five specified hierarchical levels: 1 =&gt; land/water, 2 =&gt;
              continents, 3 =&gt; countries, 4 =&gt; states, and 5 =&gt; counties (so far,  no  counties  are  included).
              When  the database is used at a particular level, entities that exist only at lower levels (larger
              level numbers) effectively disappear.

              The new database was created from data available on the World Wide Web, using  a  new  interactive
              editor  based  on  NCAR  Graphics.   There  are  plans  to  make  this editor available, so that a
              knowledgeable user can create a database tailored to his or her own needs: for  example  (assuming
              that  one  can  obtain the necessary outline data), it should now be relatively easy to create and
              use a Pangaea database with EZMAP.

              A new package of routines is used to access "Earth..1" and other databases  in  the  same  format;
              this package is called EZMAPB.  Conceptually, the EZMAPB routines are just part of EZMAP; they use
              the same common blocks and many of the same underlying low-level routines and they are affected by
              the same set of internal parameters as the routines in EZMAP proper.

              The principal EZMAPB routines are as follows:

              •   MPLNAM  (MaP  LiNes,  to  Area  Map)  -  A  routine to extract boundary lines from a specified
                  database and send them to an area map.

              •   MPLNDM (MaP LiNes, Draw Masked) - A  routine  to  extract  boundary  lines  from  a  specified
                  database and draw them, masked by the contents of an area map.

              •   MPLNDR  (MaP  LiNes, Draw) - A routine to extract boundary lines from a specified database and
                  draw them.

              •   MPLNRI - A routine to force the reading of certain information from a database  into  labelled
                  COMMON  blocks  inside EZMAP, so that subsequent references to some of the functions described
                  below will have that information to work with.  (Each of  the  routines  MPLNAM,  MPLNDM,  and
                  MPLNDR  reads this data as a side effect; MPLNRI is provided for use in cases in which none of
                  the other three routines has yet been called.)

              As each of the EZMAPB routines  MPLNAM,  MPLNDM,  and  MPLNDR  processes  boundary  lines  from  a
              specified  database,  it  calls  an EZMAPB routine named MPCHLN (the default version of which does
              nothing):

              •   MPCHLN - A user-replaceable routine that can be made to change line style, color, line  width,
                  and so on as the boundary lines from a database are being drawn; it can also be made to delete
                  particular  lines  or  to  change the area identifiers associated with them.  The arguments of
                  MPCHLN tell it which of the EZMAPB routines is calling it and whether it's being called before
                  or after the line is processed; they also supply the "line type" of the line being drawn,  the
                  area  identifiers  of  the areas on either side of it, and the actual coordinates defining the
                  line.  Line types are similar to area types (1 =&gt; land/water, 2 =&gt; continents, 3 =&gt; countries,
                  4 =&gt; states, and 5 =&gt; counties).

              Another EZMAPB routine, named MPGLTY, may be called by the user from  within  the  line-processing
              routine specified by the final argument in a call to MPLNDM:

              •   MPGLTY - Retrieves the line type of the line being drawn.

              There  is a group of EZMAPB functions providing access to information about the areas defined by a
              database being used; these may be referenced at any time  the  appropriate  information  has  been
              loaded  into  EZMAPB's  common  blocks  (that  is, after calling one of MPLNAM, MPLNDM, MPLNDR, or
              MPLNRI), but they are normally to be referenced from within the area-processing routine  specified
              as  the  final argument in a call to the AREAS routine ARSCAM, in which they may be used to obtain
              information determining the manner in which the areas are to be rendered:

              •   MPIPAI - A function whose value is non-zero if and only if the  area  with  a  specified  area
                  identifier is part of the area having a second specified area identifier.

              •   MPIPAN  -  A  function  whose  value is non-zero if and only if the area with a specified area
                  identifier is part of the area having a specified name.

              •   MPIOAR - A function whose value is the area identifier of the smallest area that is defined at
                  or above a specified level in the area hierarchy and of which the area having a specified area
                  identifier is a part.

              •   MPIATY - A function whose value is the type of the area having a specified area identifier.

              •   MPIPAR - A function whose value is the area identifier of the parent  of  the  area  having  a
                  specified area identifier.

              •   MPISCI  -  A  function whose value is the suggested color index for an area having a specified
                  area identifier.

              •   MPNAME - A function whose value is the name of the area having a particular area identifier.

              •   MPFNME - A function whose value is  the  full  name  of  the  area  having  a  specified  area
                  identifier,  up  to  a  specified  level  in  the hierarchy of areas; the full name of an area
                  consists of its own name, preceded by the name of its parent, preceded  by  the  name  of  its
                  parent's  parent,  and  so  on;  the  various  components  of  the  name  are separated by the
                  3-character string ' - ' (a blank, a dash, and another blank).

              Two additional EZMAPB functions are provided; these have nothing to do with mapping,  really,  but
              can be useful in dealing with character strings:

              •   MPIFNB  -  A function whose value is the index of the first non-blank character in a character
                  string.

              •   MPILNB - A function whose value is the index of the last non-blank character  in  a  character
                  string.

       Miscellaneous Other Routines

              The following EZMAP routines are used for the purposes stated:

              •   MAPRS  -  Re-executes the "CALL SET" done during the last call to MAPINT.  This is useful when
                  there has been an intervening call to a utility that calls SET.  It  is  quite  common  for  a
                  background drawn by EZMAP to be placed in a flash buffer (as created by the package "GFLASH").
                  When  the  contents  of  the  flash  buffer are copied to the metafile being created, if it is
                  desired to draw something on the EZMAP background, MAPRS may first have to be called to ensure
                  that the correct SET call is in effect.

              •   MPRST - Resets the internal state of EZMAP/EZMAPA to the default.

              •   SUPMAP - Draws a map with a single call. An implementation of the  routine  from  which  EZMAP
                  grew.

</pre><h4><b>USER-MODIFIABLE</b> <b>INTERNAL</b> <b>ROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       The following EZMAP routines are used for the purposes stated:

              •   MAPUSR  -  This routine is called by various EZMAP routines just before and just after drawing
                  parts of the  map.  By  default,  grid  lines  are  drawn  using  software  dashed  lines  and
                  geographical  outlines  are  drawn  using either solid lines or dotted lines. The dash pattern
                  used for the grid lines, the flag which says whether outlines are solid  or  dotted,  and  the
                  color  indices of various parts of the map are all user-settable parameters, but more complete
                  control of color indices, spot size, dash pattern, etc., may be achieved  by  supplying  one's
                  own  version  of  MAPUSR;  a  user  version  may be as complicated as is required to achieve a
                  desired effect.  Note that this routine is not called by any of the EZMAPB routines; they call
                  MPCHLN instead.

              •   MAPEOD - This routine is called by the EZMAP routine MAPLOT and by the EZMAPA routines  MAPBLA
                  and  MAPBLM; in each case, it is called once for each segment in the outline dataset. The user
                  may supply a version which examines the segment to see if it ought to be plotted and, if  not,
                  to  delete it.  This can be used (for example) to reduce the clutter in northern Canada.  Note
                  that this routine is not called by any of the EZMAPB routines; they call MPCHLN instead.

              •   MPCHLN - This routine is called by the EZMAPB routines MPLNAM, MPLNDM,  and  MPLNDR;  in  each
                  case,  it  is  called  just  before  and  just after the processing of each segment in the map
                  database.  The default version does nothing; a  user-supplied  version  can  do  for  the  new
                  databases what MAPUSR and MAPEOD did for the old ones.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use  EZMAP  Fortran  or  C  routines, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c,
       preferably in that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       When error conditions are detected, the support routine SETER is  called.  By  default,  SETER  writes  a
       message  to  the  standard  error  file  (as  defined by <a href="../man4/I1MACH.4.html">I1MACH</a>(4)) and then terminates execution.  It is
       possible to put SETER into recovery mode and regain control after a recoverable error (which includes all
       of the possible errors).

       The possible error messages are listed below.  All errors are  recoverable  in  the  sense  that  a  user
       program  which  has  called  ENTSR  to  set recovery mode will get control back after one of these errors
       occurs.
