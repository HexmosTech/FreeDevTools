</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Image::PNG::Libpng - Perl interface to the C library "libpng".

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Libpng-like interface:

           use Image::PNG::Libpng ':all';
           my $png = create_read_struct ();
           open my $file, '&lt;:raw', 'nice.png' or die $!;
           $png-&gt;init_io ($file);
           $png-&gt;read_png ();
           close $file;
           # Get all valid chunks
           my $valid = $png-&gt;get_valid ();
           my @valid_chunks = sort grep {$valid-&gt;{$_}} keys %$valid;
           print "Valid chunks are ", join (", ", @valid_chunks), "\n";
           # Print image information
           my $header = $png-&gt;get_IHDR ();
           for my $k (keys %$header) {
               print "$k: $header-&gt;{$k}\n";
           }

       (This example is included as <u>examples/synopsis.pl</u> &lt;https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/Image-PNG-
       Libpng-0.59/examples/synopsis.pl&gt; in the distribution.)

       Simple interface:

           use Image::PNG::Libpng ':all';
           my $png = read_png_file ('../t/tantei-san.png');
           # Get all valid chunks
           my $valid = $png-&gt;get_valid ();
           my @valid_chunks = sort grep {$valid-&gt;{$_}} keys %$valid;
           print "Valid chunks are ", join (", ", @valid_chunks), "\n";
           # Print image information
           my $header = $png-&gt;get_IHDR ();
           for my $k (keys %$header) {
               if ($k eq 'color_type') {
                   print "$k: " . color_type_name ($header-&gt;{$k}) . "\n";
               }
               else {
                   print "$k: $header-&gt;{$k}\n";
               }
           }
           my $wpng = $png-&gt;copy_png ();
           $wpng-&gt;write_png_file ('new.png');

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Image::PNG::Libpng version 0.59, corresponding to git commit
       1b99f6eb7a1bf68bb4d3c392454d0ace5fb1d81c &lt;https://github.com/benkasminbullock/image-png-
       libpng/commit/1b99f6eb7a1bf68bb4d3c392454d0ace5fb1d81c&gt; at Mon Feb 24 15:00:50 2025 +0900.

       Unless otherwise qualified, comments in this document on the libpng source code and documentation refer
       to libpng version 1.6.45. Libpng is not bundled with this distribution, so your installed version may
       vary.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Image::PNG::Libpng is a Perl library for accessing the contents of PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
       images. Image::PNG::Libpng enables Perl to use the "libpng" library to read and write files in PNG
       format. Image::PNG::Libpng does not contain the libpng library. The libpng library must be installed on
       your computer prior to installing Image::PNG::Libpng.

       Image::PNG::Libpng consists of Perl subroutines which mirror the C functions in libpng, plus helper
       subroutines to make it easier to read and write PNG data in Perl.

       For those familiar with libpng, the section "Differences from libpng" explains the differences with
       libpng.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The functions in the module are gathered into the following categories: "Simple input and output", which
       describes some convenience functions, "Libpng-style input and output", which describes functions which
       closely mirror libpng, "The image header", which describes functions for reading and writing the meta-
       information about PNG images, "Image data", which describes functions for accessing the image data
       itself, "Text chunks", "Private chunks", "Library version functions", "Compression and filtering", "Other
       chunks", "Libpng transformations", "Other libpng functions", functions from libpng which don't fit
       elsewhere, and "Other functions", which are functions specific to this module.

</pre><h4><b>Simple</b> <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b></h4><pre>
       These convenience functions combine common operations. They are not part of the original libpng API.

   <b>copy_png</b>
           my $outpng = $png-&gt;copy_png ();

       Copy a PNG from a read to a write structure. This function bridges two kinds of object, "read a png"
       objects created by "create_read_struct" and "write a png" objects created by "create_write_struct". This
       function copies all the valid chunks from a read structure to a write structure.

       The following example demonstrates copying a PNG.

           use utf8;
           use FindBin '$Bin';
           use Image::PNG::Libpng qw(read_png_file write_png_file) ;
           my $pngin = read_png_file ("$Bin/../t/tantei-san.png");
           my $pngout = $pngin-&gt;copy_png ();
           $pngout-&gt;set_text ([{key =&gt; 'Name', text =&gt; 'Shunsaku Kudo'}]);
           # $pngout-&gt;write_png_file ('copy.png');

       (This example is included as <u>examples/copy-png.pl</u> &lt;https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/Image-PNG-
       Libpng-0.59/examples/copy-png.pl&gt; in the distribution.)

   <b>create_reader</b>
            my $png = create_reader ('file.png');
            $png-&gt;read_png ();

       This combines "create_read_struct", "open", and "init_io" on the specified file name but does not read
       the file in. This is for the case that the user wants to apply some kind of transformation.

       <u>Setting</u> <u>the</u> <u>background</u>

       In the following example, the user sets the background with "set_background" to replace the alpha
       channel.

           use utf8;
           use FindBin '$Bin';
           use Image::PNG::Libpng ':all';
           use Image::PNG::Const ':all';
           my $file = "$Bin/luv.png";
           my %color = (red =&gt; 0xC0, green =&gt; 0xFF, blue =&gt; 0xFF);
           my $png = create_reader ($file);
           $png-&gt;set_background (\%color, PNG_BACKGROUND_GAMMA_SCREEN, 0);
           $png-&gt;read_png ();
           my $wpng = copy_png ($png);
           $wpng-&gt;write_png_file ("$Bin/set-background.png");

       (This example is included as <u>examples/set-background.pl</u> &lt;https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/Image-
       PNG-Libpng-0.59/examples/set-background.pl&gt; in the distribution.)

       examples/luv.png &lt;https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/Image-PNG-Libpng-0.59/examples/luv.png&gt; is
       included in the distribution.

       examples/set-background.png &lt;https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/Image-PNG-Libpng-0.59/examples/set-
       background.png&gt; is included in the distribution.

       This function was added to the module in version 0.53.

   <b>create_writer</b>
            my $png = create_writer ('file.png');
            $png-&gt;set_IHDR (\%ihdr);
            $png-&gt;set_rows (\@rows);
            $png-&gt;write_png ();

       This combines "create_write_struct", "open", and "init_io" on the specified file name but does not read
       the file in. This is for the case that the user wants to apply some kind of transformation before
       writing.

       This function was added to the module in version 0.53.

   <b>read_from_scalar</b>
            my $png = read_from_scalar ($string);

       This creates an image structure $png from the contents of a Perl scalar variable $string containing PNG
       image data, for example data read from a file, or data obtained from a web page. The first argument,
       $png, is a PNG structure created with "create_read_struct". It reads in all the data from the structure
       on being called.

       This is useful when image data is stored in a Perl scalar. For example

           use Image::PNG::Libpng 'read_from_scalar';
           use LWP::Simple;
           use JSON::Create;
           my $image_data = get '<a href="http://libpng.org/pub/png/img_png/libpng-88x31.png">http://libpng.org/pub/png/img_png/libpng-88x31.png</a>';
           # Now $image_data contains the PNG file
           my $png = read_from_scalar ($image_data);
           # Now $png contains the PNG information from the image.
           # Get the header.
           my $header = $png-&gt;get_IHDR ();
           my $jc = JSON::Create-&gt;new (indent =&gt; 1, sort =&gt; 1);
           print $jc-&gt;run ($header);

       (This example is included as <u>examples/get-www-png.pl</u> &lt;https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/Image-PNG-
       Libpng-0.59/examples/get-www-png.pl&gt; in the distribution.)

       The output looks like this:

           {
                   "bit_depth":4,
                   "color_type":3,
                   "height":31,
                   "interlace_method":0,
                   "width":88
           }

       See also "Input and output manipulation functions".

   <b>read_png_file</b>
            my $png = read_png_file ('q.png');

       Open <u>q.png</u> and read its contents into $png.

       This combines "create_read_struct", "open", "init_io", and "read_png". The return value is the same as
       that of "create_read_struct" with the entire PNG image already read in.

       The optional argument to "read_png" can be specified using an optional "transforms" argument:

           my $png = read_png_file ('file.png', transforms =&gt; PNG_TRANSFORM_EXPAND);

       "croak" in Carp is used to signal errors opening or closing the file.

   <b>set_transforms</b>
           $png-&gt;set_transforms (PNG_TRANSFORM_BGR);

       Set transforms for reading and writing. This is the same as the optional argument to "read_png" or
       "write_png". If both this and the optional argument are given, the optional argument overrides what is
       set here.

   <b>write_png_file</b>
           $png-&gt;write_png_file ('nice.png');

       This combines open, "init_io", and "write_png" to write an entire PNG image out to the file name
       specified by the argument. $png must be the object created by "create_write_struct", so "read_png_file"
       followed by a call to this does not work. See "copy_png" if you need to do that kind of operation.

       The optional argument to "write_png" can be specified using "set_transforms".

       "croak" in Carp is used to signal errors opening or closing the file.

   <b>write_to_scalar</b>
           my $image_data = $png-&gt;write_to_scalar ();

       This writes the PNG image data in $png into a Perl scalar. The first argument, $png, is a writeable PNG
       structure created with "create_write_struct". The return value of the subroutine is the Perl scalar
       containing the image data.

       So, for example,

           # This CGI script prints a PNG in a random colour.

           use Image::PNG::Libpng ':all';
           use Image::PNG::Const ':all';
           my $png = create_write_struct ();
           my $size = 100;
           $png-&gt;set_IHDR ({height =&gt; $size, width =&gt; $size, bit_depth =&gt; 8,
                            color_type =&gt; PNG_COLOR_TYPE_RGB});
           my $bytes = pack "CCC", randcol (), randcol (), randcol ();
           my @rows = ($bytes x $size) x $size;
           $png-&gt;set_rows (\@rows);
           my $img = $png-&gt;write_to_scalar ();
           binmode STDOUT;
           print "Content-Type:image/png\r\n\r\n$img";
           exit;
           sub randcol
           {
               return int (rand () * 0x100);
           }

       (This example is included as <u>examples/png-cgi.pl</u> &lt;https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/Image-PNG-
       Libpng-0.59/examples/png-cgi.pl&gt; in the distribution.)

       See also "Input and output manipulation functions".

       The optional argument to "write_png" can be specified using "set_transforms".

</pre><h4><b>Libpng-style</b> <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b></h4><pre>
       There are two different "new"-like functions, depending on whether you want to read or write a PNG,
       "create_read_struct" and "create_write_struct". These are based on the libpng API. Input uses "open" plus
       "init_io" followed by "read_png" or "write_png".

   <b>Examples</b>
       <u>A</u> <u>self-pixellating</u> <u>program</u>

       This example demonstrates writing a monochrome PNG by creating a write structure with
       "create_write_struct", opening a filehandle to write it, associating the filehandle with the PNG
       structure with "init_io", then using the functions "write_info", "write_image", and then "write_end" to
       actually write the PNG data to the file.

           use utf8;
           use FindBin '$Bin';
           use Image::PNG::Libpng ':all';
           use Image::PNG::Const ':all';
           my $outfile = "$Bin/mono.png";
           my ($height, $width, $rows) = pixelate (__FILE__, 5);
           my $png = create_write_struct ();
           open my $out, "&gt;:raw", $outfile or die $!;
           $png-&gt;init_io ($out);
           $png-&gt;set_IHDR ({height =&gt; $height, width =&gt; $width, bit_depth =&gt; 1,
                            color_type =&gt; PNG_COLOR_TYPE_GRAY});
           $png-&gt;set_text ([{key =&gt; 'silly', text =&gt; 'finely-tuned breakfast cereal',}]);
           $png-&gt;set_tIME ({year =&gt; 1999});

                               my $offset = $x*$box + $c;
                               my $byte = int ($offset / 8);

   <b>create_read_struct</b>
            my $png = create_read_struct ();

       Create a structure for reading a PNG. The return value can be used as an object with the other functions
       as methods. It can be copied to a write structure with "copy_png".

       This function corresponds to "png_create_read_struct" in libpng plus "create_info_struct" (see "No info
       structure") with the error and warning handler variables set up to use Perl's error reporting.

   <b>create_write_struct</b>
            my $png = create_write_struct ();

       Create a structure for writing a PNG. This can be used as an object with the other functions as methods.

       This function corresponds to "png_create_write_struct" in libpng plus "create_info_struct" (see "No info
       structure")  with the error and warning handler variables set up to use Perl's error reporting.

   <b>init_io</b>
            open my $file, "&lt;", 'nice.png';
            $png-&gt;init_io ($file);

       Set the file which $png reads or writes to $file. $file must be an already-opened Perl file handle. If
       $png was created with "create_write_struct", $file must be opened for writing. If $png was created with
       "create_read_struct", $file must be open for reading.

       Since PNG files are binary files, it is safest to specify the "raw" pragma or use "binmode" with the file
       to override any default text file encoding which Perl might be using:

            open my $file, "&gt;:raw", 'output.png';

       or

            open my $file, "&gt;", 'output.png';
            binmode $file;

       This function corresponds to "png_init_io" in libpng, with a Perl file handle substituting for the C
       "FILE *".

       <u>Caveats</u> <u>when</u> <u>using</u> <u>init_io</u>

       Check the return value of open

       On some versions of Perl, "init_io" may crash in some circumstances with an error like "segmentation
       fault", if you use code like

           my $png = create_read_struct ();
           open my $file, "&lt;:raw", "some.png";
           $png-&gt;init_io ($file);

       and you do not check whether the call to "open" was successful, and <u>some.png</u> does not exist. The crash
       occurs within Perl's conversion of $file into a C "FILE *" pointer, before this module's code runs. This
       bug was fixed in Perls after version 5.24.1. To avoid trouble, please check the return value of "open".

       Cannot deal with non-file filehandles

       Since "init_io" is a Perl access to an underlying C function "png_init_io", it requires something which
       can be passed to the underlying C as a "FILE *", C's file structure. If, for example you use IO::String
       or open a scalar reference as a file handle, since these actions do not create a C file structure, an
       error of the form "scalar's file handle is NULL" will occur.

       If you have a PNG in the form of a Perl scalar, use "read_from_scalar" instead of "init_io", which uses a
       C function called "png_set_read_fn" so that the C library can access the data in the Perl scalar. See
       also "Input and output manipulation functions".

   <b>read_end</b>
            $png-&gt;read_end ();

       Read the part of the PNG file after the image data.

       This function corresponds to "png_read_end" in libpng.

   <b>read_image</b>
            my $rows = $png-&gt;read_image ();

       Read the image data of the PNG file.

       This function corresponds to "png_read_image" in libpng.

   <b>read_info</b>
           $png-&gt;read_info ();

       Read the part of the PNG file before the image data.

       This function corresponds to "png_read_info" in libpng.

   <b>read_png</b>
            $png-&gt;read_png ();

       Read the entire PNG file into memory.

       You can provide an argument containing transformations to apply to the image:

            use Image::PNG::Const qw/PNG_TRANSFORM_STRIP_ALPHA/;
            $png-&gt;read_png (PNG_TRANSFORM_STRIP_ALPHA);

       If the argument is omitted, the default value of "PNG_TRANSFORM_IDENTITY" (the "do nothing" value) is
       applied. The possible transformations which can be applied are

       PNG_TRANSFORM_BGR
           Flip RGB to BGR, RGBA to BGRA. See also "set_bgr".

       This  function  corresponds  to "png_read_png" in libpng with a default value for the third argument. The
       fourth, unused, argument to "png_read_png" does not need to be supplied. See "Unused arguments omitted".

       It does not take a second "info" argument. See "No info structure".

   <b>read_update_info</b>
           $png-&gt;read_update_info ();

       ⛐🤪⚠ Inside Image::PNG::Libpng, the libpng function "png_read_update_info" is called before reading image
       data.  According to "The libpng documentation", this function may only be called once for any  particular
       info  structure. So although the above Perl interface exists in the module, it is strongly recommended to
       not use this unless you know exactly what you are doing, since it will usually cause an  error  when  the
       image data is read.

       This function corresponds to "png_read_update_info" in libpng

   <b>write_end</b>
           $png-&gt;write_end ();

       Write the final part of the PNG file.

       This function corresponds to "png_write_end" in libpng.

   <b>write_image</b>
           $png-&gt;write_image ($rows);

       Write the image of the PNG file. $rows is an array reference as per "set_rows".

       This function corresponds to "png_write_image" in libpng.

   <b>write_info</b>
           $png-&gt;write_info ();

       Write the first part of the PNG file.

       This function corresponds to "png_write_info" in libpng.

   <b>write_png</b>
           $png-&gt;write_png ();

       This writes the PNG to the file stream which was associated with it using "init_io". For example,

           open my $output, "&gt;:raw", 'out.png';
           $png-&gt;init_io ($output);
           $png-&gt;write_png ();
           close $output;

       An optional argument consists of transformations to apply to the PNG image before writing it:

           use Image::PNG::Const qw/PNG_TRANSFORM_STRIP_ALPHA/;
           $png-&gt;write_png (PNG_TRANSFORM_STRIP_ALPHA);

       The transformations which can be applied are as follows:

       PNG_TRANSFORM_BGR
           Flip RGB to BGR, RGBA to BGRA. See also "set_bgr".

       PNG_TRANSFORM_INVERT_ALPHA
           Change alpha from opacity to transparency. See also "set_invert_alpha".

       PNG_TRANSFORM_INVERT_MONO
           Invert monochrome images. See also "set_invert_mono".

       PNG_TRANSFORM_PACKING

       PNG_TRANSFORM_STRIP_FILLER_AFTER
           Strip out trailing filler bytes.

       PNG_TRANSFORM_STRIP_FILLER_BEFORE
           Strip out leading filler bytes.

       PNG_TRANSFORM_SWAP_ALPHA
           Flip RGBA to ARGB or GA to AG. See also "set_swap_alpha".

       PNG_TRANSFORM_SWAP_ENDIAN
           Byte-swap 16-bit samples. See also "set_swap".

       This function corresponds to "png_write_png" in libpng.

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>header</b></h4><pre>
       These    functions    handle    the    header   part   of   PNG   image   data.   See   this   subsection
       &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/">http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/</a>#11IHDR&gt; of "The PNG specification" for information on the  PNG  standards  for
       the image header.

   <b>color_type_name</b>
           $name = color_type_name ($color_type);

       This  is  a  convenience  function  which  returns  a string corresponding to the numerical color type in
       $color_type. The name is in upper case, with words separated by underscores, as in "RGB_ALPHA".

           use Image::PNG::Libpng ':all';
           my $png = read_png_file ('tantei-san.png');
           my $name = color_type_name ($png-&gt;get_IHDR-&gt;{color_type});
           print "Your PNG has colour type $name.\n";

       (This example is included as <u>examples/color-type-name.pl</u>  &lt;https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/Image-
       PNG-Libpng-0.59/examples/color-type-name.pl&gt; in the distribution.)

       This  function  does  not  correspond  to anything in libpng. The names of the color types are taken from
       those defined in the libpng header file, "png.h".

   <b>get_bit_depth</b>
           my $bit_depth = $png-&gt;get_bit_depth ();

       Get the bit depth, the number of bits for one channel of one pixel.

       This function corresponds to "png_get_bit_depth" in libpng

   <b>get_channels</b>
           my $channels = $png-&gt;get_channels ();

       Get the number of channels, from one to four. The channels are the components of pixels, for example  the
       red   channel   or   the   alpha   (transparency)   channel.  The  return  value  is  1  for  color  type
       "PNG_COLOR_TYPE_GRAY"  and   "PNG_COLOR_TYPE_PALETTE",   2   for   "PNG_COLOR_TYPE_GRAY_ALPHA",   3   for
       "PNG_COLOR_TYPE_RGB"  and  4  for  "PNG_COLOR_TYPE_RGB_ALPHA" or "PNG_COLOR_TYPE_RGB" with a filler byte.
       Note that the number of channels does not necessarily correspond to the number of bytes,  since  the  bit
       depth  can  also  be  1,  2,  4, 8, or 16, depending on the color type. See also the convenience function
       "color_type_channels".

       This function corresponds to "png_get_channels" in libpng

   <b>get_color_type</b>
           my $color_type = $png-&gt;get_color_type ();

       This returns an integer value. If you want to get a name for the color type, use "color_type_name".

       This function corresponds to "png_get_color_type" in libpng.

   <b>get_IHDR</b>
           my $IHDR = $png-&gt;get_IHDR ();

       Read the IHDR information from the PNG file.  The  return  value  is  a  hash  reference  containing  the
       following key/value pairs:

       width
           The width of the image in pixels.

       height
           The height of the image in pixels.

       bit_depth
           The  bit  depth  of the image (the number of bits used for each color in a pixel).  This can take the
           values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.

       color_type
           The  color  type.   This  can  take  the   values   PNG_COLOR_TYPE_GRAY,   PNG_COLOR_TYPE_GRAY_ALPHA,
           PNG_COLOR_TYPE_PALETTE, PNG_COLOR_TYPE_RGB, PNG_COLOR_TYPE_RGB_ALPHA.

       interlace_method
           The method of interlacing.  This can take the values PNG_INTERLACE_NONE, PNG_INTERLACE_ADAM7.

       So, for example, to get the width and height of an image,

           my $ihdr = $png-&gt;get_IHDR ();
           printf "Your image is %d x %d\n", $ihdr-&gt;{width}, $ihdr-&gt;{height};

       This  function corresponds to "png_get_IHDR" in libpng, with a single Perl hash reference used instead of
       the several pointers to integers used in libpng.

       It does not return the fields "filter_type" and "compression_type", since these are always 0. See "Unused
       arguments omitted".

   <b>get_image_height</b>
           my $height = $png-&gt;get_image_height ();

       Get the image's height from the header.

       This function corresponds to "png_get_image_height" in libpng

   <b>get_image_width</b>
           my $width = $png-&gt;get_image_width ();

       Get the image's width from the header.

       This function corresponds to "png_get_image_width" in libpng

   <b>get_interlace_type</b>
           my $interlace_type = $png-&gt;get_interlace_type ();

       Get the interlace type. This is either PNG_INTERLACE_NONE or PNG_INTERLACE_ADAM7.

       This function corresponds to "png_get_interlace_type" in libpng

   <b>get_valid</b>
           my $valid = $png-&gt;get_valid ();
           if ($valid-&gt;{oFFs}) {
               print "The PNG has valid screen offsets.\n";
           }

       This function returns a hash with a key for each possible chunk which may or may not be valid. The chunks
       which you can test for are "bKGD", "cHRM", "eXIf", "gAMA", "hIST", "hIST", "iCCP",  IDAT,  IHDR,  "iTXt",
       "oFFs", "pCAL", "pHYs", "PLTE", "sBIT", "sCAL", "sPLT", "sRGB", "tEXt", "tIME", "tRNS", and "zTXt".

       Whereas  "libpng_supports" tells you whether the installed libpng on your system supports various chunks,
       this tells you whether the chunks are present in a particular PNG image file.

       The first argument, $png, is a PNG structure created with "create_read_struct".

       This function corresponds to "png_get_valid" in libpng, with the difference being that the  return  value
       is a hash containing a key for each possible chunk.

   <b>height</b>
           my $height = $png-&gt;height ();

       Alias for "get_image_height". This is not exported, it's intended for use with the object only.

   <b>set_IHDR</b>
           my $ihdr = {width =&gt; 10, height =&gt; 10, bit_depth =&gt; 8,
                       color_type =&gt; PNG_COLOR_TYPE_RGB};
           $png-&gt;set_IHDR ($ihdr);

       Set the IHDR chunk (the image header) of the PNG image.

       The  first  argument,  $png,  is a writeable PNG structure created with "create_write_struct". The second
       argument is a hash with the following values:

       width
           The width of the image in pixels.
            This cannot be zero, negative, or omitted.

       height
           The height of the image in pixels.
            This cannot be zero, negative, or omitted.

       bit_depth
           The bit depth of the image (the number of bits used for each color in a pixel).
            This cannot be omitted. This can have the values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.

       color_type
           The color type.
            This cannot be omitted. This can have  the  values  PNG_COLOR_TYPE_GRAY,  PNG_COLOR_TYPE_GRAY_ALPHA,
           PNG_COLOR_TYPE_PALETTE, PNG_COLOR_TYPE_RGB, PNG_COLOR_TYPE_RGB_ALPHA.

       interlace_method
           The method of interlacing.
            If  this  is  omitted,  it's set to PNG_INTERLACE_NONE. This can have the values PNG_INTERLACE_NONE,
           PNG_INTERLACE_ADAM7.

       Other fields in the hash are ignored.

       This function corresponds to "png_set_IHDR" in libpng, with a single Perl hash reference used instead  of
       the seven integers.

       The  values "compression_method", "filter_method", may be supplied by the user but are ignored since they
       may only take the value 0. See "Unused arguments omitted".

   <b>sig_cmp</b>
           if (sig_cmp ($should_be_png)) {
               print "Your data does not have a PNG signature.\n";
           }

       This subroutine looks at $should_be_png and checks whether its first bytes  correspond  to  a  valid  PNG
       signature. It returns a true value if they do not.

       It  can  also  take  two  further  arguments  consisting  of a byte offset and a number of bytes to check
       respectively:

           sig_cmp ($should_be_png, 0, 8);

       If these arguments are not supplied, the byte offset is assumed to be zero, and the number  of  bytes  to
       check is assumed to be eight.

       This  function  corresponds  to  "png_sig_cmp" in libpng, with default arguments of 0 and 8 if second and
       third arguments are not supplied.

   <b>width</b>
           my $width = $png-&gt;width ();

       Alias for "get_image_width". This is not exported, it's intended for use with the object only.

</pre><h4><b>Image</b> <b>data</b></h4><pre>
       These functions deal with accessing the image data itself.

   <b>get_rowbytes</b>
           my $bytes_in_a_row = $png-&gt;get_rowbytes ();

       This returns the number of bytes needed to hold a transformed row of an image.

       This function corresponds to "png_get_rowbytes" in libpng.

   <b>get_rows</b>
           my $rows = $png-&gt;get_rows ();
           my $pixel = substr ($rows-&gt;[10], 20, 1);

       This returns the rows of the PNG image, after uncompressing and unfiltering, as binary data.  The  return
       value,  $rows  in the example, is an array reference with a number of rows equal to the height of the PNG
       image. Each element of the array reference is a string containing the binary data making up a row of  the
       image.  The  values  of  individual  pixels  can  be  extracted from using a function such as "substr" or
       "unpack". This binary data is likely to contain bytes equal to zero.

       "get_rowbytes" gives the number of bytes in each row.

       Each row is a Perl string. Perl terminates each row of data with an extra zero byte at the end.

       This function corresponds to "png_get_rows" in libpng.

   <b>set_rows</b>
           $png-&gt;set_rows (\@rows);

       Set the rows of data to be written in to the PNG to @rows. @rows needs  to  contain  at  least  the  same
       number  of  rows of data as the height of the PNG image set with "set_IHDR", and the length of each entry
       needs to be at least the width of the image multiplied by the number of bytes required for each pixel.

       This function was changed to copy the data in version 0.46.

       This function corresponds to "png_set_rows" in libpng.

</pre><h4><b>Text</b> <b>chunks</b></h4><pre>
       See this subsection &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/">http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/</a>#11textinfo&gt; of "The PNG specification" for information  on
       the PNG standards for text information.

   <b>get_text</b>
           my $text_chunks = $png-&gt;get_text ();

       This gets all of the text chunks in the PNG image and returns them as an array reference. Each element of
       the  array  represents  one  text  chunk.  This  element  is  a  hash  reference with keys such as "key",
       "lang_key", or "compression" taken from the PNG's information.

       The text data is uncompressed by libpng. If it is international text ("ITXT"),  it  is  put  into  Perl's
       internal Unicode encoding if it is found to be valid UTF-8. (PNG "international text", "ITXT" is required
       to  be  in the UTF-8 encoding, and non-international text is required to contain whitespace and printable
       ASCII characters only. See "The PNG specification" for more on the requirements of a PNG text section.)

       This function corresponds to "png_get_text" in libpng, with a Perl array of hash  references  substituted
       for the C array of structs used by libpng. See "set_text" for details of the keys and values which may be
       returned.

   <b>set_text</b>
           $png-&gt;set_text ([\%chunk1, \%chunk2]);

       This  sets  the text chunks in a writeable image. The input value is an array reference containing one or
       more hash references. Each hash reference must have a "key" value for the  text.  According  to  the  PNG
       specification,  this should be between one and 79 bytes in length. This module enforces that restriction,
       so if you supply a key longer than that, the chunk cannot be added. A hash reference may  also  have  the
       following:

       "compression"
           The  value of "compression" controls the compression of the text. If "compression" is not supplied, a
           default value of PNG_TEXT_COMPRESSION_NONE is applied. The "compression" field can take the following
           values, available from Image::PNG::Const:

           PNG_TEXT_COMPRESSION_NONE
               TEXT = Printable ASCII and space characters.

           PNG_TEXT_COMPRESSION_zTXt
               TEXT = Printable ASCII and space characters.

           PNG_ITXT_COMPRESSION_NONE
               ITXT = International text, should be UTF-8.

           PNG_ITXT_COMPRESSION_zTXt
               ITXT = International text, should be UTF-8.

       "itxt_length"
           The string length of international text in bytes.

           ⛐🤪⚠ This is ignored by libpng when writing text chunks. When reading text chunks,  if  the  text  is
           marked as international text, libpng adds the length of the string in bytes in this field rather than
           in "text_length".

       "lang"
           This  should  be set to name of the language of the text, if the text chunk is iTXt. According to the
           PNG specification, "It is an ISO 646.IRV:1991 [ISO 646] string consisting of  hyphen-separated  words
           of 1-8 alphanumeric characters each (for example cn, en-uk, no-bok, x-klingon, x-KlInGoN)."

           Support  for  writing  "lang"  was  added in version 0.49 of this module. (Prior to that undocumented
           support existed via a differently-named key.)

           ⛐🤪⚠ This module does not attempt to check the supplied value, but merely passes it to libpng. libpng
           appears not to check the value either, nor to enforce restrictions on its length.

       "lang_key"
           This corresponds to the "Translated keyword" of the PNG specification. Note that the  user  needs  to
           supply "key" and "lang" as well as "lang_key".

           Support for writing "lang_key" was added in version 0.49 of this module.  (Prior to that undocumented
           support existed via a differently-named key.)

       "text"
           The  value of "text" is added to the PNG as the text segment. This can be omitted if you just want to
           write a key value without any accompanying text.

       "text_length"
           The string length in bytes. The user may set this, but it is ignored when writing  PNG  text  chunks,
           instead  this  module  uses the string length obtained from Perl. This key contains the length of the
           string when reading text chunks via "get_text", but if the text  is  marked  as  international  text,
           "itxt_length" is used to return its length in bytes, rather than this.

       Whether or not the value of "text" is an ITXT field is decided by the value of "compression".

       People  who  want  to fiddle with the text compression applied can do so via "set_text_compression_level"
       and the other functions described below that.

       If "set_text" is called more than once, the chunks are not overwritten but appended to the existing ones.
       (This behaviour is from libpng itself.)

       Prior to version 0.50, "set_text" would fail silently if the user added invalid chunks, for example  hash
       references without a valid "key", or things which were not hash references at all. From version 0.50, all
       invalid  inputs  cause  fatal  errors.  However,  unknown  keys in the hash references do not cause fatal
       errors.

       This function corresponds to "png_set_text" in libpng.

       <u>Example</u>

           use utf8;
           use Image::PNG::Const ':all';
           use Image::PNG::Libpng ':all';
           my $png = create_write_struct ();
           $png-&gt;set_IHDR ({width =&gt; 1, height =&gt; 1, bit_depth =&gt; 8,
                            color_type =&gt; PNG_COLOR_TYPE_GRAY});
           $png-&gt;set_rows (['X']);
           $png-&gt;set_text ([{
               compression =&gt; PNG_TEXT_COMPRESSION_NONE,
               key =&gt; "Copyright",
               text =&gt; "Copyright (C) 2020 Fat Cat",
           }, {
               compression =&gt; PNG_ITXT_COMPRESSION_zTXt,
               key =&gt; "Copyright",
               lang_key =&gt; '著者権',
               lang =&gt; 'ja_JP',
               text =&gt; '©令和２年茉莉ニャンバーガーさん',
           }]);
           $png-&gt;write_png_file ('copyright.png');

       (This example is  included  as  <u>examples/set-text.pl</u>  &lt;https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/Image-PNG-
       Libpng-0.59/examples/set-text.pl&gt; in the distribution.)

   <b>text_compression_name</b>
           my $name = Image::PNG::Libpng::text_compression_name ($text-&gt;{compression});

       Given  a  numerical  text  compression  type,  return the equivalent name. The name is in upper case. The
       possible return values are

       TEXT_NONE
       TEXT_zTXt
       ITXT_NONE
       ITXT_zTXt
       an empty string
           if the compression method is unknown.

       The compression field is also used to store the information about  whether  the  text  is  "international
       text" in UTF-8 or not.

       This  function  does  not  correspond  to anything in libpng. The names of the text compression types are
       based on those in "png.h", but without the  word  "COMPRESSION",  so  for  example  the  libpng  constant
       "PNG_ITXT_COMPRESSION_zTXt" corresponds to a return value of "ITXT_zTXt".

       See  this  subsection  &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/">http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/</a>#12Use-of-private-chunks&gt; of "The PNG specification" for
       information on the PNG standards for private chunks.

       To test whether your version of libpng supports "private chunks",  use  "libpng_supports"  with  argument
       '"UNKNOWN_CHUNKS"':

           if (libpng_supports ('UNKNOWN_CHUNKS')) {
               # do something
           }

   <b>get_chunk_malloc_max</b>
           my $max = $png-&gt;get_chunk_malloc_max ();

       This gets the maximum amount of memory that a chunk can use.

       To  test  whether  your  version  of  libpng  supports "get_chunk_malloc_max", use "libpng_supports" with
       argument '"CHUNK_MALLOC_MAX"':

           if (libpng_supports ('CHUNK_MALLOC_MAX')) {
               # do something
           }

       This function corresponds to "png_get_chunk_malloc_max" in libpng

   <b>set_chunk_malloc_max</b>
           $png-&gt;set_chunk_malloc_max ($max);

       This sets the maximum amount of memory that a chunk can use. The default value  of  libpng  1.6.45  is  8
       megabytes.

       To  test  whether  your  version  of  libpng  supports "get_chunk_malloc_max", use "libpng_supports" with
       argument '"CHUNK_MALLOC_MAX"':

           if (libpng_supports ('CHUNK_MALLOC_MAX')) {
               # do something
           }

       This function corresponds to "png_set_chunk_malloc_max" in libpng

   <b>set_keep_unknown_chunks</b>
           use Image::PNG::Const 'PNG_HANDLE_CHUNK_ALWAYS';
           $png-&gt;set_keep_unknown_chunks (PNG_HANDLE_CHUNK_ALWAYS);

       Tell libpng not to discard unknown chunks when reading the file.

   <b>get_unknown_chunks</b>
           my $private_chunks = $png-&gt;get_unknown_chunks ();
           # Get some data from a private chunk
           my $chunk_three_data = $private_chunks-&gt;[3]-&gt;{data};
           # Get the size of the data
           print length $chunk_three_data;

       This gets all of the private chunks from the image. The return value is  an  array  reference  containing
       hash references. If there are no private chunks, this returns an undefined value. There is one element of
       the  array  for  each chunk member. It is necessary to call "set_keep_unknown_chunks" with an appropriate
       value before reading the file, otherwise libpng discards unknown chunks when reading the file.

       Each member hash reference has the following keys:

       name
           The name of the unknown chunk, in the PNG chunk format (four bytes).

       location
           The location of the unknown chunk.

       data
           The data of the unknown chunk

       The "size" field of the PNG structure is not stored, because the  "data"  member  of  the  hash  contains
       information on its length.

       This function corresponds to "png_get_unknown_chunks" in libpng

   <b>set_unknown_chunks</b>

   <b>access_version_number</b>
           my $libpng_version_number = Image::PNG::Libpng::access_version_number ();

       This function returns the version of the libpng library which the module is using as an integer number.

       This function corresponds to "png_access_version_number" in libpng.

   <b>get_libpng_ver</b>
           my $libpng_version = Image::PNG::Libpng::get_libpng_ver ();

       This function returns the version of the libpng library which the module is using.

       This   function   corresponds  to  "png_get_libpng_ver"  in  libpng.  However,  it  doesn't  require  the
       "png_structp" argument of the C function. See "Unused arguments omitted".

</pre><h4><b>Compression</b> <b>and</b> <b>filtering</b></h4><pre>
   <b>get_compression_buffer_size</b>
           my $size = $png-&gt;get_compression_buffer_size ();

       Returns   the   value   of   the   compression   buffer    size,    which    may    be    altered    with
       "set_compression_buffer_size".

   <b>set_compression_buffer_size</b>
           $png-&gt;set_compression_buffer_size (100);

       Set  the  size  of  the  buffer  which  zlib  uses to compress or decompress the image data. It takes one
       argument, an integer number. This cannot be less than 6.

   <b>set_compression_level</b>
           $png-&gt;set_compression_level ($number);

       Set the compression level used to make the PNG. A value  of  0  ("Z_NO_COMPRESSION")  corresponds  to  no
       compression  at all, otherwise $number may take values of 1 ("Z_BEST_SPEED") to 9 ("Z_BEST_COMPRESSION"),
       with smaller values giving faster, and  larger  values  giving  better,  that  is  with  smaller  output,
       compression.  These  correspond  to  the -1, -2, ... -9 options to the "gzip" utility, or the compression
       level parameter of "zlib". Calling with -1 ("Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION") reverts to the default  compression.
       Calling with any other number outside the range 0 to 9 results in a fatal error.

       This function was added to the module in version 0.49.

   <b>set_compression_mem_level</b>
           $png-&gt;set_compression_mem_level ($argument);

       ⛐🤪⚠ Untested function corresponding to "png_set_compression_mem_level". Takes one integer argument.

       Sets  the  "memLevel" parameter of "deflateInit2" in zlib when writing PNG image data. Argument between 1
       for minimum memory and 9 for maximum speed. The default is 8. See "zlib documentation".

   <b>set_compression_window_bits</b>
           $png-&gt;set_compression_window_bits ($argument);

       ⛐🤪⚠ Untested function corresponding to "png_set_compression_window_bits". Takes one integer argument.

       Sets the "windowBits" parameter of "deflateInit2" in zlib when writing PNG  image  data.  Argument  value
       must be between 8 and 15 for libpng. The default is 15. See the "zlib documentation".

   <b>set_compression_strategy</b>
           $png-&gt;set_compression_strategy ($argument);

       ⛐🤪⚠ Untested function corresponding to "png_set_compression_strategy". Takes one integer argument.

       Sets  the  "strategy"  parameter  of "deflateInit2" when writing PNG image data. Setting this with libpng
       overrides libpng's default behaviour of changing the value depending on the filter in use. For zlib,  the
       argument  is  either  0  for default behaviour, or 1 to 4.  See the "zlib documentation". libpng uses the
       default strategy 0 ("Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY") for unfiltered image data, and 1  ("Z_FILTERED")  for  filtered
       image data.

   <b>set_filter</b>
           use Image::PNG::Const 'PNG_FILTER_NONE';
           $png-&gt;set_filter (PNG_FILTER_NONE);

       This sets the filters which are allowed to be used for writing a PNG image. The possible values are

       PNG_NO_FILTERS
       PNG_FILTER_NONE
       PNG_FILTER_SUB
       PNG_FILTER_UP
       PNG_FILTER_AVG
       PNG_FILTER_PAETH
       PNG_ALL_FILTERS

       These can be combined using "|" (logical or):

           use Image::PNG::Const ':all';
           set_filter ($png, PNG_FILTER_UP | PNG_FILTER_AVG);

       Please  see  this subsection &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/">http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/</a>#9Filter-types&gt; of "The PNG specification" for the
       meanings of these filter types.

       This function corresponds to "png_set_filter" in libpng with the second (unused)  argument  omitted.  See
       "Unused arguments omitted".

   <b>set_text_compression_level</b>
           $png-&gt;set_text_compression_level ($argument);

</pre><h4><b>Other</b> <b>chunks</b></h4><pre>
       These routines deal with the other possible chunks of PNGs.

       The getter and setter routines for all other chunks are designed so that the return value  of  "get_wXYZ"
       is  able  to  be  used directly as the value for "set_wXYZ", so the values of chunks can easily be copied
       from one PNG to another.

           my $values = $png1-&gt;get_wXYZ ();
           $png2-&gt;set_wXYZ ($values);

       If the chunk is not present, or if the chunk is not supported by the user's version of libpng, the return
       value of "get_wXYZ" is the undefined value.

   <b>bKGD</b>
       The background color of the PNG image.

       See this subsection &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/">http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/</a>#11bKGD&gt; of "The PNG specification" for information on  the
       PNG standards for the background chunk.

       <u>get_bKGD</u>

           my $bkgd = $png-&gt;get_bKGD ();

       Get the bKGD (background) chunk of the image.

       The return value is a hash with the following keys, depending on the color type of the image:

       index
           For palette color types, this is the offset into the palette.

       gray
           For grayscale color types.

       red
       green
       blue

       This  function  corresponds  to  "png_get_bKGD"  in  libpng with a hash function instead of a "png_color"
       struct.

       <u>set_bKGD</u>

           $png-&gt;set_bKGD ($bkgd);

       Set the bKGD (background) chunk of the image. $bkgd is a hash reference. The keys of the  hash  reference
       are as described in "get_bKGD".

       This  function  corresponds  to  "png_set_bKGD"  in  libpng with a hash function instead of a "png_color"
       struct.

   <b>cHRM</b>
       See  this  subsection  &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/">http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/</a>#11cHRM&gt;  of  "The  PNG  specification"  "cHRM   Primary
       chromaticities and white point".

       <u>get_cHRM</u>

           my $cHRM = $png-&gt;get_cHRM ();

       Get the cHRM chunk as a hash reference.

       The keys of the hash are white_x, white_y, red_x, red_y, green_x, green_y, blue_x, blue_y.

       The values of the hash are floating point numbers between 0 and 1.

       This  function corresponds to "png_get_cHRM" in libpng with a hash reference supplying the arguments. The
       hash's keys correspond to the names of the "double" arguments in libpng.

       <u>get_cHRM_XYZ</u>

           my $cHRM = $png-&gt;get_cHRM_XYZ ();

       Get the cHRM chunk as a hash reference for the XYZ color space.

       The keys of the hash are red_x, red_y, red_z, green_x, green_y, green_z, blue_x, blue_y, blue_z.

       The values of the hash are floating point numbers between 0 and 1.

       This function corresponds to "png_get_cHRM_XYZ" in libpng with a hash reference supplying the  arguments.
       The hash's keys correspond to the names of the "double" arguments in libpng.

       <u>set_cHRM</u>

           $png-&gt;set_cHRM (\%cHRM);

       Set the cHRM chunk from a hash reference.

       The keys of the hash are as for "get_cHRM". The values are floating point numbers between 0 and 1.

       This  function  corresponds  to  "png_set_cHRM"  in  libpng with a hash reference instead of the "double"
       arguments.

       <u>set_cHRM_XYZ</u>

           $png-&gt;set_cHRM_XYZ (\%cHRM);

       Set the cHRM chunk from a hash reference for the XYZ color space.

       The keys of the hash are as for "get_cHRM_XYZ". The values are floating point numbers between  0  and  1.
       The "Y" values "red_y", "green_y", and "blue_y" should sum to 1. If you supply values outside the allowed
       range, libpng corrects them silently on writing rather than producing an error.

       This  function  corresponds to "png_set_cHRM_XYZ" in libpng with a hash reference instead of the "double"
       arguments.

   <b>eXIf</b>
       The     "eXIf"     chunk     is     an     extension     to     the      PNG      specification.      See
       &lt;<a href="http://www.simplesystems.org/png-group/proposals/eXIf/">http://www.simplesystems.org/png-group/proposals/eXIf/</a>&gt;.  Support  for  this  chunk was added in version
       0.50 of this module.

       <u>get_eXIf</u>

           my $exif = $png-&gt;get_eXIf ();

       This retrieves the "eXIf" chunk from $png but does not process the internal information.

       <u>set_eXIf</u>

           $png-&gt;set_eXIf ($exif);

       libpng checks whether the chunk's first two bytes are either "II" for little-endian (from Intel) or  "MM"
       for big-endian (from Motorola) then adds the entire chunk, including the first two bytes, to the PNG.

       ⛐🤪⚠  As  of  December  2020, there appears to be a bug in libpng in which the eXIf chunk is added twice,
       causing a warning of the form "libpng warning: eXIf: duplicate" on  reading  a  PNG  file  back  in.  See
       &lt;https://github.com/glennrp/libpng/pull/351&gt;.

       <u>get_gAMA</u>

           my $gamma = $png-&gt;get_gAMA ();

       Get the gamma value or gAMA chunk. The return value is a floating-point number.

       This function corresponds to "png_get_gAMA" in libpng

       <u>set_gAMA</u>

           $png-&gt;set_gAMA (0.2);

       Set the gamma value or gAMA chunk.

       This function corresponds to "png_set_gAMA" in libpng

   <b>hIST</b>
       See this subsection &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/">http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/</a>#11hIST&gt; of "The PNG specification".

       <u>get_hIST</u>

           my $hist = $png-&gt;get_hIST ();

       If  the PNG file contains a histogram, the return value is array reference, otherwise it is the undefined
       value. The number of entries in the array reference is the same as in the palette.

       This function corresponds to "png_get_hIST" in libpng

       <u>set_hIST</u>

           $png-&gt;set_hIST (\@hist);

       Set the histogram of frequencies of the colors of a paletted ("PLTE") image. The entries of the histogram
       are 16 bit unsigned integers, so the maximum value that can be entered  is  65535  =  2^16  -  1.  Larger
       numbers  and  floating  point numbers will cause a warning to be printed and the value to be set to zero.
       The histogram must have exactly the same number of entries as the palette or the call will  fail  with  a
       warning.  A  histogram  cannot  be  added  to an image without a palette. A call to set_hIST for an image
       without a palette will cause a warning and return without setting the value.

       (I'm not sure of the best form of error handling for this function so it may change in future versions to
       have errors for a bad histogram rather than warnings.)

       This function corresponds to "png_set_hIST" in libpng

   <b>iCCP</b>
       See this subsection &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/">http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/</a>#11iCCP&gt; of "The PNG specification".

       <u>get_iCCP</u>

           my $iccp = $png-&gt;get_iCCP ();

       The return value is a hash with two keys,

       name
           The name of the profile.

       profile
           The color profile.

       The "compression_type" value, which is always 0, is not returned. See "Unused arguments omitted".

       This function corresponds to "png_get_iCCP" in libpng.

       <u>set_iCCP</u>

           $png-&gt;set_iCCP ({name =&gt; 'name', profile =&gt; 'profile'});

       This function corresponds to "png_set_iCCP" in libpng. For details of the arguments,  see  "get_iCCP".  A
       "compression_type" argument, which must always be 0 anyway, is ignored. See "Unused arguments omitted".

   <b>pCAL</b>
       pCAL  is an extension of the PNG specification which allows one to associate pixels in the PNG image with
       non-image          data          such          as           a           heat           map.           See
       &lt;<a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.1/pngext-1.1.0-pdg.html">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.1/pngext-1.1.0-pdg.html</a>#C.pCAL&gt;.

       To test whether your version of libpng supports "the pCAL extension", use "libpng_supports" with argument
       '"pCAL"':

           if (libpng_supports ('pCAL')) {
               # do something
           }

       <u>get_pCAL</u>

           my $pcal = $png-&gt;get_pCAL ();

       The return value is a hash reference with the following keys:

       params
           If this exists, its value is a reference to an array containing the parameter list of the pCAL chunk,
           which  are  floating point numbers. Within the PNG file chunk, these parameters are stored as strings
           representing floating point numbers, but you can pass in Perl  floating  point  numbers  rather  than
           strings.  The  number of parameters you should set is fixed by the "type" parameter. Refer to the PNG
           specification for full details.

       purpose
           The purpose string of the pCAL chunk.

       type
           The equation type as a number, from 0 to 3. See the PNG specification for the meanings. Other numbers
           cause an error.

       units
           The units as a string. See the PNG specification for details.

       x0  The zero value for the equation, an integer.

       x1  The max value for the equation, an integer.

       <u>get_palette_max</u>

           my $pmax = $png-&gt;get_palette_max ();

       If your libpng supports it, this will return the maximum palette index found in the image, or "-1" if the
       palette was not checked, or "0" if no palette was found.

       To  test  whether  your version of libpng supports "get_palette_max", use "libpng_supports" with argument
       '"GET_PALETTE_MAX"':

           if (libpng_supports ('GET_PALETTE_MAX')) {
               # do something
           }

       ⛐🤪⚠ This function is implemented but so far it is not very clear to me what it does, since, for example,
       it returns zero for the test image <u>t/tantei-san.png</u>  which  is  an  image  with  a  fully-used  256-color
       palette.  I've  asked about it on the libpng mailing list &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/png-mng/mailman/png-
       mng-implement/?viewmonth=202012&amp;viewday=14&gt;, but so far nobody has responded.

            # Get the green value of the twentieth entry in the palette.
            my $green = $colors-&gt;[20]-&gt;{green};

       This function gets the palette from the PNG. The return  value  is  an  array  reference  containing  the
       palette.  This  array contains hash references with the values "green", "blue" and "red" for the color of
       each pixel in the palette. If the PNG has no palette, it returns an undefined value.

       A PNG image may or may not contain a palette.  To  check  whether  the  image  contains  a  palette,  use
       something of the following form:

            use Image::PNG::Const ':all';
            my $color_type = $png-&gt;get_color_type ();
            if ($color_type == PNG_COLOR_TYPE_PALETTE) {
                # The PNG uses a palette.
            }

       A  PNG  image  may also contain a palette even when the "color_type" does not indicate that. To check for
       that case, use "get_valid".

       This function corresponds to "png_get_PLTE" in libpng.

       <u>set_PLTE</u>

           $png-&gt;set_PLTE ($palette);

       Set the palette of $png. The argument is an array reference containing hash references. There is one hash
       reference for each palette entry. The hash  references  contain  three  fields,  red,  green,  and  blue,
       corresponding to the pixel value for that palette entry. Other values in the hash references are ignored.
       For example,

           $png-&gt;set_PLTE ([{red =&gt; 1, green =&gt; 99, blue =&gt; 0x10},
                            {red =&gt; 0xFF, green =&gt; 0xFF, blue =&gt; 0xFF}]);

           my $sbit = $png-&gt;get_sBIT ();

       The  return  value  is  a  hash  reference containing integer values for the keys "red", "blue", "green",
       "gray" and "alpha", depending on the "color_type" of $png.

       ⛐🤪⚠ Prior to version 0.50 of this module, get_sBIT wrote values of 0 for all of the keys, regardless  of
       the  "color_type",  causing errors in some circumstances. From version 0.50, hash keys are not entered if
       the "color_type" of the image makes them invalid.

       unit
           The unit type, which is either PNG_SCALE_UNKNOWN, PNG_SCALE_METER, or PNG_SCALE_RADIAN.

       width
           The width, as a string.

       height
           The height, as a string.

       This  function  corresponds to "png_get_sCAL_s" in libpng. Note that this uses the sCAL_s function rather

       The return value is either the undefined value, if no "tIME" chunk exists in the PNG, or a hash reference
       containing fields "year", "month", "day", "hour", "minute" and "second". "month" and "day" start  from  1
       rather than 0.

       The  "modification  time value" of the PNG image is a chunk written into the PNG file itself, and may not
       have the same value as the operating system's modification time for the file. The tIME  chunk  is  not  a
       compulsory requirement for PNG files, and most PNG image files do not contain this chunk. PNG tIME chunks
       do  not  contain a time zone. According to this subsection &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/">http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/</a>#11tIME&gt; of "The PNG

           if (libpng_supports ('MNG_FEATURES')) {
               # do something

       This function corresponds to "png_permit_mng_features" in libpng

   <b>set_add_alpha</b>
           $png-&gt;set_add_alpha ($filler, $filler_loc);

       ⛐🤪⚠  Untested. Change $png to add an alpha channel. This only works for grayscale or RGB images with bit
       depth of 8 or 16. $filler contains the alpha value to assign to each pixel,  and  $filler_loc  is  either
       "PNG_FILLER_BEFORE"  or  "PNG_FILLER_AFTER". The function of "set_add_alpha" is "set_filler" and a change
       of the color type to add an alpha channel. See the libpng manual for details.

       To test whether your version of libpng supports  "set_add_alpha",  use  "libpng_supports"  with  argument
       '"READ_FILLER"':

           if (libpng_supports ('READ_FILLER')) {
               # do something

       ⛐🤪⚠ Untested. $mode is an integer, one of the "PNG_ALPHA_*" constants. $screen_gamma is a floating point
       number. See the libpng manual for details.

       To  test  whether  your  version of libpng supports "set_alpha_mode", use "libpng_supports" with argument
       '"READ_ALPHA_MODE"':

           if (libpng_supports ('READ_ALPHA_MODE')) {
               # do something

   <b>set_background</b>
           $png-&gt;set_background (\%color, $bkgd_gamma_code, $need_expand, $gamma);

       "set_background" sets the background of an image with an alpha channel or simple transparency  (a  "tRNS"
       chunk)  with  the color specified by %color. If $bkgd_gamma_code is set to "PNG_BACKGROUND_GAMMA_SCREEN",
       it indicates that the supplied background color is in the gamma space of the display, else if it  is  set
       to  "PNG_BACKGROUND_GAMMA_FILE",  the color is in the gamma space of the file. If $bkgd_gamma_code is set
       to "PNG_BACKGROUND_GAMMA_UNIQUE", the value of $gamma is used, otherwise $gamma appears to be ignored and
       can   be   omitted.   (This   is   not   documented   in   the   libpng   manual   or   elsewhere.    See
       &lt;https://github.com/glennrp/libpng/issues/358&gt;.)

       If  the  background color is supplied at the original bit-depth for a grayscale image that is expanded to
       truecolor or to a higher bit-depth, $need_expand must be set to a true value, but if the background color
       is supplied at the expanded bit-depth, $need_expand must be set to a false value. Similarly for  paletted
       images,  if  %color  is  supplied  as a palette index ($color{index}), $need_expand must be set to a true
       value, but if %color is an RGB triplet, $need_expand must be set to a false value.

       See "Setting the background" for an example.

       To test whether your version of libpng supports "set_background",  use  "libpng_supports"  with  argument
       '"READ_BACKGROUND"':

           if (libpng_supports ('READ_BACKGROUND')) {
               # do something
           }

   <b>set_chunk_cache_max</b>
           $png-&gt;set_chunk_cache_max (42);

       Set the maximum number of ancilliary chunks allowed. The default is 1000. See also "get_chunk_cache_max".

       To  test  whether  your  version  of  libpng  supports  "set_chunk_cache_max", use "libpng_supports" with
       argument '"CHUNK_CACHE_MAX"':

           if (libpng_supports ('CHUNK_CACHE_MAX')) {
               # do something
           }

       This function corresponds to "png_png_set_chunk_cache_max" in libpng

   <b>set_filler</b>
           $png-&gt;set_filler ($filler, $flags);

       Set transformations in $png such that a filler byte $filler is added when an  8-bit  grayscale  image  or
       24-bit  RGB image is read, and a filler byte is deleted when an 8-bit grayscale image or 24-bit RGB image
       is written. $flags may be "PNG_FILLER_BEFORE" or "PNG_FILLER_AFTER". An error is produced if $png has bit
       depth less than 8.

       This does not change the color type of the image. See the related function "set_add_alpha" if you want to
       add an alpha channel.

       To test whether your version  of  libpng  supports  "set_filler",  use  "libpng_supports"  with  argument
       '"READ_FILLER"':

           if (libpng_supports ('READ_FILLER')) {

       manual for details.

       To test whether your  version  of  libpng  supports  "set_gamma",  use  "libpng_supports"  with  argument
       '"READ_GAMMA"':

           if (libpng_supports ('READ_GAMMA')) {
               # do something
           }

       This function corresponds to "png_set_gamma" in libpng

   <b>set_quantize</b>
           $png-&gt;set_quantize (\@palette, $ncolors, \@histogram, $full_quantize);

       The @palette part must be set to a palette similar to "set_PLTE". $ncolors must be the length of @palette
       or shorter. @histogram can be an empty array or if not it needs to be an array of integers of exactly the
       same  length  as @palette. The integers represent the frequency of the colors in @palette. These integers
       can range from 0 to 65355. Larger  values  or  negative  values  cause  an  error.  The  final  argument,
       $full_quantize, should be 1 for RGB images or 0 for paletted images.

       <u>Experiments</u> <u>in</u> <u>quantization</u>

       This  example  program experiments with two ways to quantize a PNG image, first of all using a completely

           $png-&gt;set_rgb_to_gray ();

           $png-&gt;set_rgb_to_gray ($error_action, $red_weight, $green_weight);

       Convert a PNG image from RGB (colored) to gray. See the libpng manual for details.

       Without arguments, the libpng default values are used for $red_weight and  $green_weight,  and  an  error
       action  of  "none"  is  chosen.  If  the  error  action  is  set to a value of "PNG_ERROR_ACTION_WARN" or
       "PNG_ERROR_ACTION_ERROR", pixels in the RGB image where the R, G and B values are not equal will cause  a
       warning  or  error  respectively.  To  get  the  default values for $red_weight or $green_weight, use any
       negative value. See the libpng manual for details.

       If you choose "PNG_ERROR_ACTION_NONE" you can find out whether there were non-RGB pixels  in  your  image
       using "get_rgb_to_gray_status".

       This  function  corresponds  to  "png_png_set_rgb_to_gray"  in libpng with $error_action having a default

       This  allows  XS  routines to directly set the value of the row pointers for the PNG image. The memory is
       copied, so whatever is in the row pointers can be freed immediately  after  calling  this.  However,  the
       image data it points to is not copied, so this needs to be valid until the PNG is written.

       The  Perl  scalar  $row_pointers  should  be  set  up  something  like the following (where "rp" is the C
       pointer):

           RETVAL = newSViv (PTR2IV (rp));

       It's extracted from the Perl scalar using

           rp = INT2PTR (png_byte **, SvIV (row_pointers));

       where row_pointers  is  the  "SV  *"  corresponding  to  $row_pointers  in  the  Perl  script.  See  also
       "set_row_pointers" which does the same thing but takes ownership of the memory.

   <b>get_chunk</b>
           my $timechunk = $png-&gt;get_chunk ('tIME');

       Get  the  specified  chunk.  This  produces a fatal error if asked for the "IDAT" (image data) chunk, use
       "get_rows" instead. Returns "undef" if asked for an unknown chunk name.

       This is used by pnginspect to get the valid chunks. See also "set_chunk".

   <b>get_internals</b>
           my ($png_struct, $png_info) = get_internals ($png);

       This function returns the "png_structp" and "png_infop" contained in $png. The return  value  is  a  list
       containing the "png_structp" as the first argument and the "png_infop" as the second argument, wrapped up
       as references to objects of type "Image::PNG::Libpng::png_struct" and "Image::PNG::Libpng::png_info".

       To access the values of the pointers, use something like this:

           void access_png_internals (png, info)
               SV * png;
               SV * info;
           PREINIT:
               png_struct * cpng;
               png_info * cinfo;
           CODE:
               cpng = INT2PTR (png_struct *, SvIV (png));
               cinfo = INT2PTR (png_info *, SvIV (info));

       An example exists in Image::PNG::Cairo.

   <b>get_tRNS_palette</b>
           $png-&gt;get_tRNS_palette ();

       This is not a libpng-equivalent function.

   <b>image_data_diff</b>
           my $diff = image_data_diff ('a.png', 'b.png');

       This  returns  the  undefined value if the image data in <u>a.png</u> is the same as the image data in <u>b.png</u>. If
       the image data is different, it returns a readable text message describing the  first  difference  found,
       for example the height is different, or row 0 of the image data is different, etc.

       This function is used in testing this module. See also "png_compare".

   <b>libpng_supports</b>
           if (libpng_supports ('iTXt')) {
               print "Your libpng supports international text.\n";
           }

       This  function  returns  true or false depending on whether the version of libpng which this was compiled
       with supports or does not support a particular facility. For the most part, these are taken directly from
       the C macros of libpng.

       The possible arguments to "libpng_supports" are:

       cHRM_XYZ
           This is local to Image::PNG::Libpng and not a part of libpng itself.

           It was necessary to extend libpng because the conditional compilation macro  for  "set_cHRM_XYZ"  and
           "get_cHRM_XYZ",  "PNG_cHRM_SUPPORTED" is defined (true) for old libpngs which do not actually contain
           these functions.

       CHUNK_CACHE_MAX
           This is local to Image::PNG::Libpng and not a part of libpng itself.

           It was necessary to extend libpng because the conditional compilation macro for "set_chunk_cache_max"
           and "get_chunk_cache_max", "PNG_USER_LIMITS_SUPPORTED" is defined (true) for old libpngs which do not
           actually contain these functions.

       CHUNK_MALLOC_MAX
           This is local to Image::PNG::Libpng and not a part of libpng itself.

           The reasons for this are identical to those for "CHUNK_CACHE_MAX".

   <b>png_compare</b>
           if (png_compare ('a.png', 'b.png') == 0) {
               print "The PNGs are the same.\n";
           }

       This  compares the image data in two PNGs and returns 0 if they contain exactly the same image data, or 1
       if they contain different image data. For a more detailed comparison, see  "image_data_diff".  This  does
       not  compare  to see if the PNG files "look like" each other, but whether each pixel contains exactly the
       same values. Please see Image::Similar for a looser comparison of images.

       This uses the "expand" transform of libpng to read both the images, so it is able to  compare  images  of
       different  color  types. It compares the alpha values as well as the color pixels. See "Saving bandwidth"
       for an example of comparing an RGB and a grayscale image.

   <b>read_struct</b>
           if ($png-&gt;read_struct ()) {
                warn "Can't write this, use copy_png to copy it";
           }

       This returns a true value if  $png  was  created  with  "create_read_struct"  or  allied  functions  like
       "read_from_scalar",  and a false value if $png was created with "create_write_struct" or allied functions
       like "copy_png".

   <b>set_chunk</b>
           $png-&gt;set_chunk ('tIME', $timechunk);

       Set the specified chunk. This produces a  fatal  error  if  given  an  "IDAT"  (image  data)  chunk,  use
       "set_rows" instead. This produces a fatal error if given an unknown chunk name.

       The  first  argument  is  the chunk name and then the second argument is a scalar containing whatever the
       chunk requires, for example a hash reference for the "tIME"  chunk  as  described  under  "set_tIME"  and
       "get_tIME".

       This  is  essentially  a  convenience  function  for  the  benefit  of  "copy_png"  which,  together with
       "get_valid", enables the PNG chunks to be copied in a loop rather than one-by-one.

   <b>set_image_data</b>
           $png-&gt;set_image_data ($image_data);

       Set the internal image data pointer to $image_data. $image_data should contain a pointer to memory stored
       as an "SvIV" allocated with "Newx" or a similar function. This transfers ownership of the memory to $png,
       which will free it with "Safefree" when $png is destroyed. Calling this function with any value does  not
       actually change the content of the PNG image itself.

   <b>set_row_pointers</b>
           $png-&gt;set_row_pointers ($row_pointers);

       This  sets  the rows of the PNG image to $row_pointers using "png_set_rows". $row_pointers must contain a
       pointer to memory stored as an SvIV allocated with a Perl memory  allocator  like  "Newx"  or  a  similar
       function.  This  also  transfers ownership of the memory to $png, which will free it with "Safefree" when
       $png is destroyed. See also "copy_row_pointers", which does the same thing except for the freeing of  the
       memory.

   <b>split_alpha</b>
           my $split = $png-&gt;split_alpha ();
           my $alpha = $split-&gt;{alpha};
           my $color = $split-&gt;{data};

       Split  the  alpha  channel  away  from  the  other  data.  This  only  works  for images with color types
       "PNG_COLOR_TYPE_RGB_ALPHA" and "PNG_COLOR_TYPE_GRAY_ALPHA". This is not part  of  the  libpng  API.  This
       function  was  added  to  this module to assist the author of PDF::Builder due to problems with very slow
       access to PNG images using Perl.

       To remove the alpha channel from an image, use "set_background". See  "Setting  the  background"  for  an
       example.   You   can   also   use   the  transform  "PNG_TRANSFORM_STRIP_ALPHA"  in  "read_png_file",  or
       "set_strip_alpha", but this may leave spurious pixel values in transparent parts of the image.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       Nothing is exported by default, but all the functions in this module, including the object  methods,  can
       be exported on request. The export tag 'all' exports everything in the module:

           use Image::PNG::Libpng ':all';

       This includes all the methods, which can then be used with the $png argument as the first argument.

</pre><h4><b>Differences</b> <b>from</b> <b>libpng</b></h4><pre>
       The functions in Image::PNG::Libpng are closely based on those of libpng, with the following differences.

   <b>No</b> <b>info</b> <b>structure</b>
       This  module does not use the "info" structure of libpng. Almost all libpng functions require two initial
       arguments, a "png_structp" and a "png_infop". However, in Image::PNG::Libpng,  both  the  "png"  and  the
       "info"  are  contained  in the object. People who need access to the internals of an "Image::PNG::Libpng"
       object (C programmers or XS programmers) can use "get_internals" to access them.

       This module does not support the "end info" structure of PNGs when writing, although  these  are  handled
       when reading.

   <b>Unused</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>omitted</b>
       This  module  eliminates unevaluated arguments of libpng. For example, libpng requires the user to pass a
       pointer to a "png_struct" to call the libpng version number  function,  (see  "get_libpng_ver"),  but  it
       actually  ignores  this  structure. There are many similar instances of unevaluated arguments, which have
       all been eliminated from this module.

       If you are interested in exactly which libpng arguments are omitted, you can find each  instance  in  the
       file       "perl-libpng.c"       in       the       top      directory      of      the      distribution
       &lt;https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/Image-PNG-Libpng-0.59/perl-libpng.c&gt;      in      the      macro
       "UNUSED_ZERO_ARG".

   <b>Useless</b> <b>functions</b> <b>omitted</b>
       The functions from libpng which don't do anything have been omitted from this module.

   <b>Function</b> <b>return</b> <b>values</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>values</b>
       libpng  is  very inconsistent in its calling conventions. Some functions return results using references,
       and some return results using the function's return value. For example  "png_get_rows"  (see  "get_rows")
       uses the return value of the function to return an array of pointers, but "png_get_PLTE" (see "get_PLTE")
       uses a pointer reference to return an array of pointers, and the return value to indicate errors.

       Image::PNG::Libpng  uses  only the return value. Errors and non-existence are indicated by a return value
       of the undefined value.

       Further to this, libpng's error handling is also very inconsistent.  Some functions use the return  value
       to  indicate errors, and some of the functions don't indicate errors at all, but just fail silently. Even
       more inconsistently, some of the functions which use the return value to indicate an error use a non-zero
       value, and some use a zero value, to indicate an error.

   <b>No</b> <b>destructors</b>
       Freeing the memory allocated by "create_read_struct" and "create_write_struct" is  automatically  handled
       by Perl.

       Older   versions   of   this   module   (pre-0.18)   had   functions   called  "destroy_read_struct"  and
       "destroy_write_struct" corresponding to the functions with similar names in libpng.  From  version  0.18,
       these  functions  still  exist, but they no longer do anything. The memory freeing is now handled by Perl
       automatically.

   <b>Other</b> <b>unimplemented</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>libpng</b>
       <u>Memory</u> <u>management</u> <u>functions</u>

       The management of memory for libpng objects is handled automatically by this module, and so it  does  not
       offer an interface to "png_malloc" and "png_free" or other libpng memory handling functions.

       <u>Error</u> <u>handling</u> <u>functions</u>

       This  module does not offer an interface to "png_error" and "png_get_error_ptr" or any of the other error
       handling functions of libpng. It redirects the error and warning handlers to Perl's error stream.

       <u>Input</u> <u>and</u> <u>output</u> <u>manipulation</u> <u>functions</u>

       This module does not offer a direct interface to "png_set_write_fn" and "png_set_read_fn". However, it is
       possible to use their functionality to access Perl data via "read_from_scalar" and "write_to_scalar".

       <u>Fixed</u> <u>point</u> <u>functions</u>

       There is currently no support for the PNG fixed point functions in this Perl module, the  functions  with
       suffix "_fixed".

       This is an exhaustive list of unsupported libpng API functions, extracted from  the  libpng  source  code
       using <u>util/api.pl</u> in this module's repository.

   <b>Conditional</b> <b>compilation</b> <b>and</b> <b>old</b> <b>libpng</b> <b>versions</b>
       It  is  possible  to  compile  a  version  of  the libpng library without support for various things. For
       example,  a  libpng  without  support  for  text  chunks  may  be  created  by  undefining  the  C  macro
       "PNG_TEXT_SUPPORTED".  This module supports the conditional compilation choices which we're aware of, but
       if you encounter problems using this module because of a conditionally-compiled libpng, then let us  know
       and we'll add the necessary facility.

       Currently  we test this module against vanilla libpng versions 1.2.59, 1.4.22, 1.5.30, 1.6.47, and 1.6.45
       before  releases.  There  doesn't  seem  to  have  been  a  1.3  or  a  1.1  version   of   libpng.   See
       &lt;<a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngnews.html">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngnews.html</a>&gt;. Versions 1.0 and earlier of libpng are not tested against.

       The following issues with older libpng versions may affect users of this module:

       <u>cHRM</u> <u>chunk</u>

       The  "get_cHRM_XYZ"  and  "set_cHRM_XYZ"  functions  for  the  "cHRM"  chunk are not present in pre-1.5.5
       versions of libpng, but the conditional compilation macro of libpng for these newer functions is the same
       as for "get_cHRM" and "set_cHRM" functions, which are present on older versions  of  libpng.  Because  of
       this,  this  module  includes  its  own protection macro, accessible via "libpng_supports" as "cHRM_XYZ".
       These functions are disabled for libpng versions earlier than 1.5.5.

       <u>chunk_cache_max</u>

       The functions "set_chunk_cache_max" and "get_chunk_cache_max" are not protected by  a  libpng  macro,  so
       this  module  includes  its  own protection macro, accessible via "libpng_supports" as "CHUNK_CACHE_MAX".
       These functions are disabled for libpng versions earlier than 1.4.0.

       <u>Compression</u> <u>level</u>

       Versions of libpng up to 1.5 behave erratically when "set_compression_level" or other "set_compression_*"
       functions are used to alter the compression of the image data. Testing of  compression-related  functions
       is disabled by this Perl module for pre-1.6.13 versions of libpng.

       <u>Compression</u> <u>level</u> <u>and</u> <u>zlib-ng</u>

       Some people have compiled libpng with a new version of zlib known as zlib-ng. This gives different values
       for  compression  than  the original zlib. On versions of this module earlier than 0.58, this caused some
       unimportant but annoying test  failures  where  this  module  was  making  exact  size  comparisons.  See
       &lt;https://github.com/benkasminbullock/image-png-libpng/issues/40&gt;.  As  far as we know, there is no way to
       detect whether zlib-ng is being used from Perl, so to support the use of zlib-ng, these tests  have  been
       switched off. The disabled tests can be restored by setting the environment variable "ORIGINAL_ZLIB" to a
       true value, if you want them.

           ORIGINAL_ZLIB=1 prove t/*.t

       <u>sCAL</u> <u>chunk</u>

       Support for the sCAL chunk is disabled within this module for pre-1.6 versions of libpng.

       <u>Text</u> <u>chunk</u> <u>handling</u>

       Versions  of  libpng up to 1.6.3 produce erratic results with "iTXt" (international text) chunks. Testing
       of text-related chunks is disabled by this Perl module for pre-1.6.13 versions of libpng.

   <b>Not</b> <b>all</b> <b>constants</b> <b>are</b> <b>available</b>
       Some of the libpng constants are defined in <u>pnglibconf.h</u> or <u>pngconf.h</u> but Image::PNG::Const only looks at
       <u>png.h</u> to make its constants. Because of  this,  some  constant  values  like  "PNG_Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION"
       aren't  currently  available in Image::PNG::Const. This probably should be fixed to extract the constants
       from the other files in a future version.

</pre><h4><b>STANDALONE</b> <b>SCRIPT</b></h4><pre>
       A standalone script, pnginspect, is installed with the distribution. It prints out the  contents  of  the
       chunks of the PNG file on the command line.

       <u>PNG</u> <u>The</u> <u>Definitive</u> <u>Guide</u> <u>by</u> <u>Greg</u> <u>Roelofs</u>

       The  book "PNG - The Definitive Guide" by Greg Roelofs, published in 1999 by O'Reilly is available online
       at &lt;<a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/png/">http://www.faqs.org/docs/png/</a>&gt; or &lt;<a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/book/">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/book/</a>&gt;.

   <b>The</b> <b>libpng</b> <b>documentation</b>
       Official documentation
           The starting point is the plain text libpng manual  at  &lt;<a href="http://libpng.org/pub/png/libpng-manual.txt">http://libpng.org/pub/png/libpng-manual.txt</a>&gt;
           and the manual page libpng.3, which you can read using "man 3 libpng".

           ⛐🤪⚠  The  documentation which comes with libpng is rather sketchy. See "Differences from libpng". It
           doesn't contain full specifications (prototypes, return values) for  all  of  the  functions  in  the
           library.  For  programming in C using libpng, look at the header file <u>png.h</u>.  In some cases, you need
           to look at the source code of the library.

       Other documentation
           There is a collection of function definitions under the title "Interface Definitions for libpng12" at
           &lt;https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/LSB_4.0.0/LSB-Desktop-generic/LSB-Desktop-generic/libpng12man.html&gt;
           as part of the "Linux Standard Base Desktop Specification". These contain  extensive  information  on
           the  prototypes  and  return  values for the libpng routines, something which is often only available
           elsewhere by actually looking at the libpng source code. These pages are usually the  first  hits  on
           search engines if you search for a function name in libpng.

   <b>zlib</b> <b>documentation</b>
       See &lt;https://zlib.net/manual.html&gt; for the zlib documentation.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>modules</b> <b>on</b> <b>CPAN</b>
       These other modules may also be useful.

       Alien::PNG
           Alien::PNG  claims  to  be  a  way  of  "building,  finding  and  using PNG binaries". It may help in
           installing libpng. We didn't use it as a dependency for this module because it seems not to  work  in
           batch  mode,  but  stop  and prompt the user. We're interested in hearing feedback from users whether
           this works or not on various platforms.

       Imager
           Imager, Imager::Files and "Imager::Files::PNG" contain support  for  reading  and  writing  PNGs  via
           libpng,  as  well as support for reading and writing various other kinds of image files, changing the
           images, converting, and more.

       Image::ExifTool
           Image::ExifTool is a pure Perl (doesn't require  a  C  compiler)  solution  for  accessing  the  text
           segments of images. It supports PNG text segments.

       Image::Info
           Image::Info  gets  information  out  of  images.  It  supports PNG and is written in pure Perl, so it
           doesn't require a C compiler. As well as basics such as height, width, and colour type,  it  can  get
           text chunks, modification time, palette, gamma (gAMA chunk), resolution (pHYs chunk), and significant
           bits (sBIT chunk). At the time of writing (version 1.31) it doesn't support other chunks.

       Image::PNG::Rewriter
           Image::PNG::Rewriter is a utility for unpacking and recompressing the IDAT (image data) part of a PNG
           image.  The  main  purpose  seems  to  be to recompress the image data with the module author's other
           module Compress::Deflate7. At the time of writing, that only works with Perl versions 5.12 or later.

       Image::Pngslimmer
           Image::Pngslimmer reduces the size of dynamically created PNG images. It's very, very slow at reading
           PNG data, but seems to work OK.

       Image::PNG::Write::BW
           Image::PNG::Write::BW writes black and white PNGs from strings.

       Image::Size
           If you only need to read the sizes of images, Image::Size works with PNG and other image formats.
