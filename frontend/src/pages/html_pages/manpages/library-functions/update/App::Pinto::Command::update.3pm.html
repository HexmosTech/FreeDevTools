</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Pinto::Command::update - update packages to latest versions

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.14

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         pinto --root=REPOSITORY_ROOT update [OPTIONS] TARGET ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       !! THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL !!!

       This command updates packages in your repository to the newer versions in an updstream repository.  By
       default, Pinto takes the first newer version that it finds.  If the "--cascade" option is used, then
       Pinto will take the newest version it finds among all the upstream repositories.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments are the names of the pakcages you want to install.  If using the "--all" or "--roots" options
       then arguments are not allowed.

       You can also pipe arguments to this command over STDIN.  In that case, blank lines and lines that look
       like comments (i.e. starting with "#" or ';') will be ignored.  If using the "--all" or "--roots"
       options, then input will not be read from STDIN.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --all
           Update  all  distributions  in  the  stack.   We do not attempt to update locally added distributions
           unless "--force" is used.  If this option is used, then package names  cannot  be  given  as  command
           arguments.  See also the "--roots" option.

       --cascade
           !! THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL !!

           When  searching  for  a  package  (or  one of its prerequisites), always take the latest satisfactory
           version of the package found amongst <b>all</b> the upstream repositories, rather than just taking the <b>first</b>
           newer version that is found.  Remember that Pinto only searches the upstream  repositories  when  the
           local repository does not already contain a satisfactory version of the package.

       --diff-style=STYLE
           Controls  the  style  of  the  diff  reports.  STYLE must be either "concise" or "detailed".  Concise
           reports show only one record for each distribution added  or  deleted.   Detailed  reports  show  one
           record for every package added or deleted.

           The   default   style  is  "concise".   However,  the  default  style  can  changed  by  setting  the
           "PINTO_DIFF_STYLE" environment variable to your preferred STYLE.  This variable affects  the  default
           style for diff reports generated by all other commands too.

       --dry-run
           Go  through  all  the  motions,  but  do  not  actually commit any changes to the repository.  At the
           conclusion, a diff showing the changes that would have been made will be displayed.  Use this  option
           to see how upgrades would potentially impact the stack.

       --force
           Forcibly  unpin  any packages that require updating.  The pins will not be restored after a succesful
           update.

       --no-fail
           !! THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL !!

           Normally, failure to pull a target (or its prerequisites) causes the command to immediately abort and
           rollback the changes to the repository. But if C &lt;--no-fail&gt; is set, then only the changes caused  by
           the  failed  target  (and  its  prerequisites)  will  be  rolled  back  and the command will continue
           processing the remaining targets.

           This option is useful if you want to throw a list of targets into a repository and see which ones are
           problematic.  Once you've fixed the broken ones, you can throw  the  whole  list  at  the  repository
           again.

       --message=TEXT
       -m TEXT
           Use  TEXT  as  the  revision  history  log  message.  If you do not use the "--message" option or the
           "--use-default-message" option, then you will be prompted to enter the message via your text  editor.
           Use the "PINTO_EDITOR" or "EDITOR" or "VISUAL" environment variables to control which editor is used.
           A  log message is not required whenever the "--dry-run" option is set, or if the action did not yield
           any changes to the repository.

       --pin
           Pins the packages to the stack, so they cannot be changed until you unpin them.  Only the packages in
           the requested targets will be pinned -- packages in prerequisites will not be pinned.   However,  you
           may pin them separately with the pin command if you so desire.

       --recurse
       --no-recurse
           Recursively  pull  any  distributions required to satisfy prerequisites for the targets.  The default
           value for this option can be configured in the <u>pinto.ini</u> configuration file for the repository (it is
           usually set to 1).  To disable recursion, use "--no-recurse".

       --roots
           Updates the root distributions of the stack.  We do not attempt to update locally added distributions
           unless "--force" is used.  If this option is used, then package names  cannot  be  given  as  command
           arguments.  See also the "--all" option.

       --skip-missing-prerequisite=PACKAGE
       -k PACKAGE
           !! THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL !!

           Skip  any  prerequisite  with  name  PACKAGE  if  a satisfactory version cannot be found.  However, a
           warning will be given whenever this occurrs.  This option only has effect when  recursively  fetching
           prerequisites for the targets (See also the "--recurse" option). This option can be repeated.

       --skip-all-missing-prerequisites
       -K  !! THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL !!

           Skips  all  missing prerequisites if a satisfactory version cannot be found.  However, a warning will
           be given whenever this occurrs.  This option will silently override the "--skip-missing-prerequisite"
           option and only has effect when recursively fetching prerequisites for  the  targets  (See  also  the
           "--recurse" option).

       --stack=NAME
       -s NAME
           Puts all the packages onto the stack with the given NAME.  Defaults to the name of whichever stack is
           currently marked as the default stack.  Use the stacks command to see the stacks in the repository.

       --use-default-message
       -M  Use  the  default value for the revision history log message.  Pinto will generate a semi-informative
           log message just based on the command and its  arguments.   If  you  set  an  explicit  message  with
           "--message", the "--use- default-message" option will be silently ignored.

       --with-development-prerequisites
       --wd
           Also   pull  development  prerequisites  so  you'll  have  everything  you  need  to  work  on  those
           distributions, in the event that you  need  to  patch  them  in  the  future.   Be  aware  that  most
           distributions do not actually declare their development prerequisites.
