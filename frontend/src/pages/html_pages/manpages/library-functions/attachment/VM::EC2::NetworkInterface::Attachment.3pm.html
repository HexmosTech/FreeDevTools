</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       VM::EC2::NetworkInterface::Attachment -- Object representing attachment of a network interface to an
       instance

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use VM::EC2;
         my $ec2 = VM::EC2-&gt;new(...);
         my $instance = $ec2-&gt;describe_instances('i-123456');
         my @interfaces = $instance-&gt;network_interfaces();
         for my $i (@interfaces) {
            my $attachment = $i-&gt;attachment;
            my $att_id      = $attachment-&gt;attachmentId;
            my $ins_id      = $attachment-&gt;instanceId;
            my $instance    = $attachment-&gt;instance;
            my $device      = $attachment-&gt;device;
            my $status      = $attachment-&gt;status;
            my $time        = $attachment-&gt;attachmentTime;
            my $delete      = $attachment-&gt;deleteOnTermination;
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This object describes the attachment of a elastic network interface (ENI) to an instance, and allows you
       to manipulate the attachment.

       Please see VM::EC2::Generic for methods shared by all VM::EC2 objects.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       These object methods are supported:

        attachmentId          -- ID of the attachment
        instanceId            -- ID of the instance
        instanceOwnerId       -- ID of the owner of the instance
        deviceIndex           -- Ethernet device number, e.g. "0" for eth0
        status                -- Always "attached"; see below.
        attachmentTime        -- Time this ENI was attached to the instance, as a DateTime
        deleteOnTermination   -- If true, this ENI will be deleted when the instance terminates.

       Amazon does not document the network interface attachment object well, and many of these fields are
       inferred by inspection of EC2 REST responses. In particular, the status field always seems to be
       "attached", but there may be another state, such as "pending", which is too short lived to be apparent.

       In addition, this object supports the following convenience methods:

        instance    -- The VM::EC2::Instance to which the ENI is attached.

</pre><h4><b>STRING</b> <b>OVERLOADING</b></h4><pre>
       When used in a string context, this object will be interpolated as the attachmentId.
