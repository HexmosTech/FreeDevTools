</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       RT::Client::REST::Attachment - attachment object representation.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.72

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $attachments = $ticket-&gt;attachments;

         my $count = $attachments-&gt;count;
         print "There are $count attachments.\n";

         my $iterator = $attachments-&gt;get_iterator;
         while (my $att = &amp;$iterator) {
             print "Id: ", $att-&gt;id, "; Subject: ", $att-&gt;subject, "\n";
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An attachment is a second-class citizen, as it does not exist (at least from the current REST protocol
       implementation) by itself.  At the moment, it is always associated with a ticket (see <b>parent_id</b>
       attribute).  Thus, you will rarely retrieve an attachment by itself; instead, you should use
       "attachments()" method of RT::Client::REST::Ticket object to get an iterator for all attachments for that
       ticket.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>id</b>
         Numeric ID of the attachment.

       <b>creator_id</b>
         Numeric ID of the user who created the attachment.

       <b>parent_id</b>
         Numeric  ID  of  the  object  the attachment is associated with.  This is not a proper attribute of the
         attachment as specified by REST -- it is simply to store the ID of the RT::Client::REST::Ticket  object
         this attachment belongs to.

       <b>subject</b>
         Subject of the attachment.

       <b>content_type</b>
         Content type.

       <b>file_name</b>
         File name (if any).

       <b>transaction_id</b>
         Numeric ID of the RT::Client::REST::Transaction object this attachment is associated with.

       <b>message_id</b>
         Message ID.

       <b>created</b>
         Time when the attachment was created

       <b>content</b>
         Actual content of the attachment.

       <b>headers</b>
         Headers (not parsed), if any.

       <b>parent</b>
         Parent (not sure what this is yet).

       <b>content_encoding</b>
         Content encoding, if any.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>RT::Client::REST::Attachment</b>  is  a  read-only object, so you cannot "store()" it.  Also, because it is a
       second-class citizen, you cannot "search()" or "count()" it -- use  "attachments()"  method  provided  by
       RT::Client::REST::Ticket.

       retrieve
         To retrieve an attachment, attributes <b>id</b> and <b>parent_id</b> must be set.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>can</b>
         Wraps the normal <u><b>can()</b></u> call, to exclude unsupported methods from parent.

       <b>rt_type</b>
         Returns 'attachment'.

</pre><h4><b>CREATING</b> <b>ATTACHMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Currently RT does not allow creating attachments via their API.

       See &lt;https://rt-wiki.bestpractical.com/wiki/REST#Ticket_Attachment&gt;
