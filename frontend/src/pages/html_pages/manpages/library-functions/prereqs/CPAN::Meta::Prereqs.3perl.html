</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPAN::Meta::Prereqs - a set of distribution prerequisites by phase and type

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.150010

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A CPAN::Meta::Prereqs object represents the prerequisites for a CPAN distribution or one of its optional
       features.  Each set of prereqs is organized by phase and type, as described in CPAN::Meta::Prereqs.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         my $prereq = CPAN::Meta::Prereqs-&gt;new( \%prereq_spec );

       This method returns a new set of Prereqs.  The input should look like the contents of the "prereqs" field
       described in CPAN::Meta::Spec, meaning something more or less like this:

         my $prereq = CPAN::Meta::Prereqs-&gt;new({
           runtime =&gt; {
             requires =&gt; {
               'Some::Module' =&gt; '1.234',
               ...,
             },
             ...,
           },
           ...,
         });

       You can also construct an empty set of prereqs with:

         my $prereqs = CPAN::Meta::Prereqs-&gt;new;

       This empty set of prereqs is useful for accumulating new prereqs before finally dumping the whole set
       into a structure or string.

   <b>requirements_for</b>
         my $requirements = $prereqs-&gt;requirements_for( $phase, $type );

       This method returns a CPAN::Meta::Requirements object for the given phase/type combination.  If no
       prerequisites are registered for that combination, a new CPAN::Meta::Requirements object will be
       returned, and it may be added to as needed.

       If $phase or $type are undefined or otherwise invalid, an exception will be raised.

   <b>phases</b>
         my @phases = $prereqs-&gt;phases;

       This method returns the list of all phases currently populated in the prereqs object, suitable for
       iterating.

   <b>types_in</b>
         my @runtime_types = $prereqs-&gt;types_in('runtime');

       This method returns the list of all types currently populated in the prereqs object for the provided
       phase, suitable for iterating.

   <b>with_merged_prereqs</b>
         my $new_prereqs = $prereqs-&gt;with_merged_prereqs( $other_prereqs );

         my $new_prereqs = $prereqs-&gt;with_merged_prereqs( \@other_prereqs );

       This method returns a new CPAN::Meta::Prereqs objects in which all the other prerequisites given are
       merged into the current set.  This is primarily provided for combining a distribution's core prereqs with
       the prereqs of one of its optional features.

       The new prereqs object has no ties to the originals, and altering it further will not alter them.

   <b>merged_requirements</b>
           my $new_reqs = $prereqs-&gt;merged_requirements( \@phases, \@types );
           my $new_reqs = $prereqs-&gt;merged_requirements( \@phases );
           my $new_reqs = $prereqs-&gt;merged_requirements();

       This method joins together all requirements across a number of phases and types into a new
       CPAN::Meta::Requirements object.  If arguments are omitted, it defaults to "runtime", "build" and "test"
       for phases and "requires" and "recommends" for types.

   <b>as_string_hash</b>
       This method returns a hashref containing structures suitable for dumping into a distmeta data structure.
       It is made up of hashes and strings, only; there will be no Prereqs, CPAN::Meta::Requirements, or
       "version" objects inside it.

   <b>is_finalized</b>
       This method returns true if the set of prereqs has been marked "finalized," and cannot be altered.

   <b>finalize</b>
       Calling "finalize" on a Prereqs object will close it for further modification.  Attempting to make any
       changes that would actually alter the prereqs will result in an exception being thrown.

   <b>clone</b>
         my $cloned_prereqs = $prereqs-&gt;clone;

       This method returns a Prereqs object that is identical to the original object, but can be altered without
       affecting the original object.  Finalization does not survive cloning, meaning that you may clone a
       finalized set of prereqs and then modify the clone.
