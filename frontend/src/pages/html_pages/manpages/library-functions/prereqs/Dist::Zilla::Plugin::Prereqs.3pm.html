</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs - list simple prerequisites

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 6.032

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       In your <u>dist.ini</u>:

         [Prereqs]
         Foo::Bar = 1.002
         MRO::Compat = 10
         Sub::Exporter = 0

       You can specify requirements for different phases and relationships with:

         [Prereqs]
         -phase = test
         -relationship = recommends

         Fitz::Fotz    = 1.23
         Text::SoundEx = 3

       Remember that if you load two Prereqs plugins, each will needs its own name, added like this:

         [Prereqs / PluginName]
         -phase = test
         -relationship = recommends

         Fitz::Fotz    = 1.23
         Text::SoundEx = 3

       If the name is the CamelCase concatenation of a phase and relationship (or just a relationship), it will
       set those parameters implicitly.  If you use a custom name, but it does not specify the relationship, and
       you didn't specify either "-phase" or "-relationship", it throws the error "No -phase or -relationship
       specified".  This is to prevent a typo that makes the name meaningless from slipping by unnoticed.

       The example below is equivalent to the example above, except for the name of the resulting plugin:

         [Prereqs / TestRecommends]
         Fitz::Fotz    = 1.23
         Text::SoundEx = 3

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module adds "fixed" prerequisites to your distribution.  These are prereqs with a known, fixed
       minimum version that doesn't change based on platform or other conditions.

       You can specify prerequisites for different phases and kinds of relationships.  In "RuntimeRequires", the
       phase is Runtime and the relationship is Requires.  These are described in more detail in the CPAN::Meta
       specification.

       The phases are:

       ‚Ä¢   configure

       ‚Ä¢   build

       ‚Ä¢   test

       ‚Ä¢   runtime

       ‚Ä¢   develop

       The relationship types are:

       ‚Ä¢   requires

       ‚Ä¢   recommends

       ‚Ä¢   suggests

       ‚Ä¢   conflicts

       If  the  phase  is  omitted,  it will default to <u>runtime</u>; thus, specifying "Prereqs / Recommends" in your
       dist.ini is equivalent to <u>RuntimeRecommends</u>.

       Not all of these phases are useful for all tools, especially  tools  that  only  understand  version  1.x
       CPAN::Meta files.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This  module  should  work  on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That  is,  if  the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although  it  may  work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
