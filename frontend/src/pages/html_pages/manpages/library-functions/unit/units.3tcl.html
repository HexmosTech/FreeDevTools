</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  library  provides  a  conversion  facility  from  a variety of scientific and engineering shorthand
       notations into floating point numbers.  This allows application developers to easily convert values  with
       different units into uniformly scaled numbers.

       The  units  conversion  facility  is  also  able to convert between compatible units.  If, for example, a
       application  is  expecting  a  value  in  <u>ohms</u>  (Resistance),   and   the   user   specifies   units   of
       <u>milliwebers/femtocoulomb</u>,  the  conversion  routine  will  handle  it  appropriately.   An  error will be
       generated if an incorrect conversion is attempted.

       Values are scaled from one set of units to another by dimensional analysis.  Both the value units and the
       target units are reduced into primitive units and a scale factor.  Units are checked  for  compatibility,
       and  the  scale factors are applied by multiplication and division.  This technique is extremely flexible
       and quite robust.

       New units and new unit abbreviations can be defined in terms of existing units and abbreviations.  It  is
       also possible to define a new primitive unit, although that will probably be unnecessary.  New units will
       most  commonly  be  defined  to accommodate non-SI measurement systems, such as defining the unit <u>inch</u> as
       <u>2.54</u> <u>cm</u>.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>::units::convert</b> <u>value</u> <u>targetUnits</u>
              Converts the <u>value</u> string into a floating point number, scaled to the specified <u>targetUnits</u>.   The
              <u>value</u> string may contain a number and units.  If units are specified, then they must be compatible
              with  the  <u>targetUnits</u>.   If  units are not specified for the <u>value</u>, then it will be scaled to the
              target units.  For example,

              % ::units::convert "2.3 miles" km
              3.7014912
              % ::units::convert 300m/s miles/hour
              671.080887616
              % ::units::convert "1.0 m kg/s^2" newton
              1.0
              % ::units::convert 1.0 millimeter
              1000.0

       <b>::units::reduce</b> <u>unitString</u>
              Returns a unit string consisting of a scale factor followed by a space separated  list  of  sorted
              and  reduced primitive units.  The reduced unit string may include a forward-slash (separated from
              the surrounding primitive subunits by spaces) indicating that the remaining subunits  are  in  the
              denominator.  Generates an error if the <u>unitString</u> is invalid.

              % ::units::reduce pascal
              1000.0 gram / meter second second

       <b>::units::new</b> <u>name</u> <u>baseUnits</u>
              Creates  a new unit conversion with the specified name.  The new unit <u>name</u> must be only alphabetic
              (upper or lower case) letters.  The <u>baseUnits</u> string can consist of  any  valid  units  conversion
              string,  including  constant  factors,  numerator  and denominator parts, units with prefixes, and
              exponents.  The baseUnits may contain any number of subunits, but  it  must  reduce  to  primitive
              units.   BaseUnits  could  also be the string <u>-primitive</u> to represent a new kind of quantity which
              cannot be derived from other units.  But you probably would not do that unless you have discovered
              some kind of new universal property.

              % ::units::new furlong "220 yards"
              % ::units::new fortnight "14 days"
              % ::units::convert 100m/s furlongs/fortnight
              601288.475303

</pre><h4><b>UNIT</b> <b>STRING</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Value and unit string format is quite flexible.  It is possible to define virtually  any  combination  of
       units, prefixes, and powers.  Valid unit strings must conform to these rules.

       •      A  unit  string consists of an optional scale factor followed by zero or more subunits.  The scale
              factor must be a valid floating point number, and may or may not be separated from  the  subunits.
              The scale factor could be negative.

       •      Subunits are separated form each other by one or more separator characters, which are space (" "),
              hyphen  ("-"), asterisk ("*"), and forward-slash ("/").  Sure, go ahead and complain about using a
              minus sign ("-") to represent multiplication.  It just isn't sound mathematics, and, by rights, we
              should require everyone to use the asterisk ("*") to separate all units.  But the bottom  line  is
              that complex unit strings like <u>m-kg/s^2</u> are pleasantly readable.

       •      The forward-slash seperator ("/") indicates that following subunits are in the denominator.  There
              can be at most one forward-slash separator.

       •      Subunits  can be floating point scale factors, but with the exception of the leading scale factor,
              they must be surrounded by valid separators.  Subunit scale factors cannot be negative.  (Remember
              that the hyphen is a unit separator.)

       •      Subunits  can  be  valid  units  or abbreviations.  They may include a prefix.  They may include a
              plural suffix "s" or "es".  They may also include a power string denoted by  a  circumflex  ("^"),
              followed  by  a  integer,  after  the  unit  name  (or  plural suffix, if there is one).  Negative
              exponents are not allowed.  (Remember that the hyphen is a unit separator.)

</pre><h4><b>SI</b> <b>UNITS</b></h4><pre>
       The standard SI units are predefined according to <u>NIST</u> <u>Special</u> <u>Publication</u> <u>330</u>.  Standard units for  both
       SI  Base Units (Table 1) and SI Derived Units with Special Names (Tables 3a and 3b) are included here for
       reference.  Each standard unit name and abbreviation are included in this package.

       Note that the SI unit kilograms is actually implemented as grams because 1e-6 kilogram = 1 milligram, not
       1 microkilogram.  The abbreviation for Electric Resistance (ohms), which is the omega character,  is  not
       supported.

       Also  note  that there is no support for Celsius or Farenheit temperature.  The units conversion routines
       can only scale values  with  multiplication  and  division,  so  it  is  not  possible  to  convert  from
       thermodynamic   temperature   (kelvins)   to  absolute  degrees  Celsius  or  Farenheit.   Conversion  of
       thermodynamic quantities, such as thermal expansion (per unit temperature), however, are easy to  add  to
       the units library.

       SI Units can have a multiple or sub-multiple prefix.  The prefix or its abbreviation should appear before
       the  unit,  without  spaces.  Compound prefixes are not allowed, and a prefix should never be used alone.
       These prefixes are defined in Table 5 of <u>Special</u> <u>Publication</u> <u>330</u>.

       Note that we define the same prefix with both the USA ("deka") and non-USA ("deca") spellings.  Also note
       that we take the liberty of allowing "micro" to be typed as a "u" instead of the Greek character mu.

       Many non-SI units are commonly used in applications.  Appendix B.8 of <u>NIST</u> <u>Special</u> <u>Publication</u> <u>811</u>  lists
       many  non-SI  conversion  factors.   It  is not possible to include all possible unit definitions in this
       package.  In some cases, many different conversion factors exist for  a  given  unit,  depending  on  the
       context.  (The  appendix  lists  over  40  conversions  for British thermal units!)  Application specific
       conversions can always be added using the <b>new</b> command, but some well known and often used conversions are
       included in this package.

   <b>QUANTITIES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DERIVED</b> <b>UNITS</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>SPECIAL</b> <b>NAMES</b>
       This units conversion package is limited specifically to unit reduction, comparison, and  scaling.   This
       package  does  not  consider  any  of  the  quantity  names  for either base or derived units.  A similar
       implementation or an extension in a typed or object-oriented language might introduce user defined  types
       for  the quantities.  Quantity type checking could be used, for example, to ensure that all <u>length</u> values
       properly reduced to <u>meters</u>, or that all <u>velocity</u> values properly reduced to <u>meters/second</u>.

       A C implementation of this package has been created to work in conjunction with  the  Simplified  Wrapper
       Interface  Generator  (<u><a href="http://www.swig.org/">http://www.swig.org/</a></u>).   That  package (units.i) exploits SWIG's typemap system to
       automatically convert script quantity strings into floating point  quantities.   Function  arguments  are
       specified as quantity types (e.g., <u>typedef</u> <u>float</u> <u>Length</u>), and target units (expected by the C application
       code)  are specified in an associative array.  Default units are also defined for each quantity type, and
       are applied to any unit-less quantity strings.

       A units system enhanced with quantity type checking might benefit from inclusion of other  derived  types
       which  are  expressed  in terms of special units, as illustrated in Table 2 of <u>NIST</u> <u>Publication</u> <u>330</u>.  The
       quantity <u>area</u>, for example, could be defined as units properly reducing to <u>meter^2</u>, although the  utility
       of defining a unit named <u>square</u> <u>meter</u> is arguable.

       The  unit  names,  abbreviations,  and  conversion  values are derived from those published by the United
       States Department of Commerce Technology Administration, National Institute of Standards  and  Technology
       (NIST)  in  <u>NIST</u>  <u>Special</u>  <u>Publication</u>  <u>330:</u>  <u>The</u>  <u>International</u>  <u>System</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>Units</u> <u>(SI)</u> and <u>NIST</u> <u>Special</u>
       <u>Publication</u> <u>811:</u> <u>Guide</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>Use</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>International</u> <u>System</u> <u>of</u> <u>Units</u> <u>(SI)</u>.  Both of these publications
       are available (as of December 2000) from <u><a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Reference/contents.html">http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Reference/contents.html</a></u>

       The ideas behind implementation of this package is based in part  on  code  written  in  1993  by  Adrian
       Mariano which performed dimensional analysis of unit strings using fixed size tables of C structs.  After
       going  missing  in  the  late  1990's,  Adrian's  code  has  reappeared  in  the  GNU  Units  program  at
       <u><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/units/">http://www.gnu.org/software/units/</a></u>
