       "Tickit::Pen" - store a collection of rendering attributes

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A pen instance stores a collection of rendering attributes for text to display. It comes in two forms,
       mutable and immutable. Both types of pen are subclasses of the base "Tickit::Pen" class.

       An immutable pen is an instance of "Tickit::Pen::Immutable". Its attributes are set by the constructor
       and are fixed thereafter. Methods are provided to query the presence or value of attributes, and to fetch
       the entire set as a hash.

       A mutable pen is an instance of "Tickit::Pen::Mutable". Its attributes may be set by the constructor, and
       can be changed at any time. As well as supporting the same query methods as immutable pens, more methods
       are provided to change or remove them.

       While mutable pens may initially seem more useful, they can complicate logic due to their shared
       referential nature. If the same mutable pen is shared across multiple places, care needs to be taken to
       redraw anything that depends on it if it is ever changed. If pens need sharing, especially if results are
       cached for performance, consider using immutable pens to simplify the logic.

   <b>Attributes</b>
       The following named pen attributes are supported:

       fg =&gt; COL
       bg =&gt; COL
               Foreground  or  background  colour.  "COL"  may be an integer or one of the eight colour names. A
               colour name may optionally be prefixed by "hi-"  for  the  high-intensity  version  (may  not  be
               supported  by  all  terminals). Some terminals may support a palette of 256 colours instead, some
               16, and some only 8. The pen object will not check this as it cannot be reliably detected in  all
               cases.

       fg:rgb8 =&gt; STRING
       bg:rgb8 =&gt; STRING
               Foreground  or background colour secondary RGB8 specification. The value is a string encoding the
               three 8-bit values in hexadecimal notation, prefixed by a hash ("#") symbol; for example

                  #13579B

               On input, either lower- or upper-case is accepted; on output the letters will be upper-case.

               These attribute can only be set if  the  corresponding  regular  index  attribute  is  also  set.
               Changing or clearing the regular index will also clear the RGB8 version.

               Applications  wishing to use this attribute should be aware that the majority of terminal drivers
               will not be able to support it, and so should make sure to  set  an  appropriate  regular  colour
               index  as  well. Some terminals using the <u>xterm</u> driver may make use of it, however, and therefore
               ignore the index version.

       b =&gt; BOOL
       u =&gt; BOOL
       i =&gt; BOOL
       rv =&gt; BOOL
       strike =&gt; BOOL
       blink =&gt; BOOL
               Bold, underline, italics, reverse video, strikethrough, blink.

       af =&gt; INT
               Alternate font.

       Note that not all terminals can render the italics, strikethrough, or alternate font attributes.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTORS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
          $pen = Tickit::Pen-&gt;new( %attrs )

       Returns a new pen, initialised from the given attributes.

       Currently this method returns a "Tickit::Pen::Mutable", though this may change in a future version. It is
       provided for backward-compatibility for code that  expects  to  be  able  to  construct  a  "Tickit::Pen"
       directly.

          $pen = Tickit::Pen::Immutable-&gt;new( %attrs )

          $pen = Tickit::Pen::Mutable-&gt;new( %attrs )

       Return a new immutable, or mutable pen, initialised from the given attributes.

   <b>new_from_attrs</b>
          $pen = Tickit::Pen-&gt;new_from_attrs( $attrs )

       Returns  a  new  pen,  initialised  from keys in the given HASH reference. Used keys are deleted from the
       hash.

       Currently this method returns a "Tickit::Pen::Mutable", though this may change in a future version. It is
       provided for backward-compatibility for code that  expects  to  be  able  to  construct  a  "Tickit::Pen"
       directly.

          $pen = Tickit::Pen::Immutable-&gt;new_from_attrs( $attrs )

          $pen = Tickit::Pen::Mutable-&gt;new_from_attrs( $attrs )

       Return a new immutable, or mutable pen, initialised from the given attributes.

   <b>as_mutable</b>
   <b>clone</b>
          $pen = $orig-&gt;as_mutable

          $pen = $orig-&gt;clone

       Returns a new mutable pen, initialised by copying the attributes of the original.

       "clone" is provided as a legacy alias, but may be removed in a future version.

   <b>as_immutable</b>
          $pen = $orig-&gt;as_immutable

       Returns  an  immutable  pen,  initialised  by  copying  the attributes of the original. When called on an
       immutable pen, this method just returns the same pen instance.

   <b>mutable</b>
          $is_mutable = $pen-&gt;mutable

       Returns true on mutable pens and false on immutable ones.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b> <b>ON</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>PENS</b></h4><pre>
       The following query methods apply to both immutable and mutable pens.

   <b>hasattr</b>
          $exists = $pen-&gt;hasattr( $attr )

       Returns true if the given attribute exists on this object

   <b>getattr</b>
          $value = $pen-&gt;getattr( $attr )

       Returns the current value of the given attribute

   <b>getattrs</b>
          %values = $pen-&gt;getattrs

       Returns a key/value list of all the attributes

   <b>equiv_attr</b>
          $equiv = $pen-&gt;equiv_attr( $other, $attr )

       Returns true if the two pens have the equivalent values for the given attribute;  that  is,  either  both
       define it to the same value, or neither defines it.

   <b>equiv</b>
          $equiv = $pen-&gt;equiv( $other )

       Returns true if the two pens have equivalent values for all attributes.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b> <b>ON</b> <b>MUTABLE</b> <b>PENS</b></h4><pre>
       The following mutation methods exist on mutable pens.

   <b>chattr</b>
          $pen-&gt;chattr( $attr, $value )

       Change the value of an attribute. Setting "undef" deletes the attribute entirely. See also "delattr".

   <b>chattrs</b>
          $pen-&gt;chattrs( \%attrs )

       Change the values of all the attributes given in the hash. Recgonised attributes will be deleted from the
       hash.

   <b>delattr</b>
          $pen-&gt;delattr( $attr )

       Delete an attribute from this pen. This attribute will no longer be modified by this pen.

   <b>copy_from</b>
   <b>default_from</b>
          $pen-&gt;copy_from( $other )

          $pen-&gt;default_from( $other )

       Copy  attributes  from  the  given  pen.  "copy_from"  will  override attributes already defined by $pen;
       "default_from" will only copy attributes that are not yet defined by $pen.

       As a convenience both methods return $pen.
