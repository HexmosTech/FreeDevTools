       Catalyst::Middleware::Stash - The Catalyst stash - in middleware

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       We've moved the Catalyst stash to middleware.  Please don't use this directly since it is likely to move
       off the Catalyst namespace into a stand alone distribution

       We store a coderef under the "PSGI_KEY" which can be dereferenced with key values or nothing to access
       the underlying hashref.

       Anything placed into the stash will be available in the stash of any 'mounted' Catalyst applications.  A
       mounted Catalyst application may set the stash and 'pass back' information to the parent application.
       Non Catalyst applications may use this middleware to access and set stash values.

       Please note I highly recommend having a stronger interface than a stash key between applications.

       For more information the current test case t/middleware-stash.t is the best documentation.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       This class defines the following subroutines.

   <b>PSGI_KEY</b>
       Returns the hash key where we store the stash.  You should not assume the string value here will never
       change!  Also, its better to use "get_stash" or "stash".

   <b>get_stash</b>
       Expect: $psgi_env.

       Exportable subroutine.

       Get the stash out of the $env.

   <b>stash</b>
       Expects: An object that does "env" and arguments

       Exportable subroutine.

       Given an object with a method "env" get or set stash values, either as a method or via hashref
       modification.  This stash is automatically reset for each request (it is not persistent or shared across
       connected clients.  Stash key / value are stored in memory.

           use Plack::Request;
           use Catalyst::Middleware::Stash 'stash';

           my $app = sub {
             my $env = shift;
             my $req = Plack::Request-&gt;new($env);
             my $stashed = $req-&gt;stash-&gt;{in_the_stash};  # Assume the stash was previously populated.

             return [200, ['Content-Type' =&gt; 'text/plain'],
               ["I found $stashed in the stash!"]];
           };

       If the stash does not yet exist, an exception is thrown.
