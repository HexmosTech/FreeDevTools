       Bio::AnnotationI - Annotation interface

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # generally you get AnnotationI's from AnnotationCollectionI's

          foreach $key ( $ac-&gt;get_all_annotation_keys() ) {
              @values = $ac-&gt;get_Annotations($key);
              foreach $value ( @values ) {
                 # value is an Bio::AnnotationI, and defines a "as_text" method
                 print "Annotation ",$key," stringified value ",$value-&gt;as_text,"\n";
                 # you can also use a generic hash_tree method for getting
                 # stuff out say into XML format
                 $hash_tree = $value-&gt;hash_tree();
              }
          }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Interface all annotations must support. There are two things that each annotation has to support.

         $annotation-&gt;as_text()

       Annotations have to support an "as_text" method. This should be a single text string, without newlines
       representing the annotation, mainly for human readability. It is not aimed at being able to
       store/represent the annotation.

       The second method allows annotations to at least attempt to represent themselves as pure data for
       storage/display/whatever. The method hash_tree should return an anonymous hash with "XML-like"
       formatting:

          $hash = $annotation-&gt;hash_tree();

       The formatting is as follows.

         (1) For each key in the hash, if the value is a reference'd array -

         (2) For each element of the array if the value is a object -
                 Assume the object has the method "hash_tree";
         (3) else if the value is a reference to a hash
                 Recurse again from point (1)
         (4) else
                 Assume the value is a scalar, and handle it directly as text
         (5) else (if not an array) apply rules 2,3 and 4 to value

       The XML path in tags is represented by the keys taken in the hashes. When arrays are encountered they are
       all present in the path level of this tag

       This is a pretty "natural" representation of an object tree in an XML style, without forcing everything
       to inherit off some super-generic interface for representing things in the hash.

   <b>Mailing</b> <b>Lists</b>
       User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other Bioperl modules. Send your comments
       and suggestions preferably
        to one of the Bioperl mailing lists.  Your participation is much appreciated.

   <b>Support</b>
       Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

       <u><a href="mailto:bioperl-l@bioperl.org">bioperl-l@bioperl.org</a></u>

       rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and reponsive experts will be able look
       at the problem and quickly address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem with code and
       data examples if at all possible.

   <b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b>
       Report bugs to the Bioperl bug tracking system to help us keep track the bugs and their resolution.  Bug
       reports can be submitted via the web:

</pre><h4><b>APPENDIX</b></h4><pre>
       The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods. Internal methods are usually preceded
       with a _

   <b>as_text</b>
        Title   : as_text
        Usage   :
        Function: single text string, without newlines representing the
                  annotation, mainly for human readability. It is not aimed
                  at being able to store/represent the annotation.
        Example :
        Returns : a string
        Args    : none

   <b>display_text</b>
        Title   : display_text
        Usage   : my $str = $ann-&gt;display_text();
        Function: returns a string. Unlike as_text(), this method returns a string
                  formatted as would be expected for the specific implementation.

                  Implementations should allow passing a callback as an argument which
                  allows custom text generation; the callback will be passed the
                  current implementation.

                  Note that this is meant to be used as a simple representation
                  of the annotation data but probably shouldn't be used in cases
                  where more complex comparisons are needed or where data is
                  stored.
        Example :
        Returns : a string
        Args    : [optional] callback

   <b>hash_tree</b>
        Title   : hash_tree
        Usage   :
        Function: should return an anonymous hash with "XML-like" formatting
        Example :
        Returns : a hash reference
        Args    : none

   <b>tagname</b>
        Title   : tagname
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;tagname($newval)
        Function: Get/set the tagname for this annotation value.

                  Setting this is optional. If set, it obviates the need to
                  provide a tag to Bio::AnnotationCollectionI when adding
                  this object. When obtaining an AnnotationI object from the
                  collection, the collection will set the value to the tag
                  under which it was stored unless the object has a tag
                  stored already.

        Example :
        Returns : value of tagname (a scalar)
        Args    : new value (a scalar, optional)
