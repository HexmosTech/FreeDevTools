</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NOTE:</b> <b>This</b> <b>document</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>under</b> <b>construction.</b> <b>Expect</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>incomplete</b> <b>in</b> <b>places.</b>

       LMDB_File is a Perl module which allows Perl programs to make use of the facilities provided by
       OpenLDAP's Lightning Memory-Mapped Database "LMDB".

       LMDB is a Btree-based database management library modeled loosely on the BerkeleyDB API, but much
       simplified and extremely fast.

       It is assumed that you have a copy of LMBD's documentation at hand when reading this documentation. The
       interface defined here mirrors the C interface closely but with an OO approach.

       This is implemented with a number of Perl classes.

       A LMDB's <b>environment</b> handler (MDB_env* in C) will be wrapped in the <b>LMDB::Env</b> class.

       A LMDB's <b>transaction</b> handler (MDB_txn* in C) will be wrapped in the <b>LMDB::Txn</b> class.

       A LMDB's <b>cursor</b> handler (MDB_cursor* in C) will be wrapped in the <b>LMDB::Cursor</b> class.

       A LMDB's <b>Database</b> handler (MDB_dbi in C) will be exposed as a simple integer, but because in LMDB all
       Database operations needs both a Transaction and a Database handler, LMDB_File provides you a convenient
       "LMDB_File" object that encapsulates both and mimic the syntax of other *_File modules.

</pre><h4><b>Error</b> <b>reporting</b></h4><pre>
       In the C API, most functions return 0 on success and an error code on failure.

       In this module, when a function fails, the package variable <b>$die_on_err</b> controls the course of action.
       When <b>$die_on_err</b> is set to TRUE, this causes LMDB_File to "die" with an error message that can be trapped
       by an "eval { ... }" block.

       When FALSE, the function will return the error code, in this case you should check the return value of
       any function call.

       By default <b>$die_on_err</b> is TRUE.

       Regardless of the value of <b>$die_on_err</b>, the code of the last error can be found in the package variable
       <b>$last_err</b>.

</pre><h4><b>LMDB::Env</b></h4><pre>
       This class wraps an opened LMDB <b>environment</b>.

       At construction time, the environment is created, if it does not exist, and opened.

       When you are finished using it, in the C API you must call the "mdb_env_close" function to close it and
       free the memory allocated, but in Perl you simply will let that the object get out of scope.

   <b>Constructor</b>
       $Env = LMDB::Env-&gt;new ( $path [, ENVOPTIONS ] )

       Creates a new "LMDB::Env" object and returns it. It encapsulates both LMDB's "mdb_env_create" and
       "mdb_env_open" functions.

       <u>$path</u> is the directory in which the database files reside. This directory must already exist and should
       be writable.

       <b>ENVOPTIONS</b>, if provided, must be a HASH Reference with any of the following options:

       mapsize    =&gt; INT
           The size of the memory map to use for this environment.

           The  size  of the memory map is also the maximum size of the database.  The value should be chosen as
           large as possible, to accommodate future growth of the database. The size should be a multiple of the
           OS page size.

           The default is 1048576 bytes (1 MB).

       maxreaders =&gt; INT
           The maximum number of threads/reader slots for the environment.

           This defines the number of slots in the lock table that is used to track readers in the environment.

           The default is 126.

       maxdbs     =&gt; INT
           The maximum number of named databases for the environment.

           This option is  only  needed  if  multiple  databases  will  be  used  in  the  environment.  Simpler
           applications that use the environment as a single unnamed database can ignore this option.

           The default is 0, i.e. no named databases allowed.

       mode  =&gt; INT
           The  UNIX  permissions  to set on created files. This parameter is ignored on Windows. It defaults to
           0600

       flags      =&gt; ENVFLAGS
           Set special options for this environment. This option, if provided, can be specified  by  OR'ing  the
           following flags:

           MDB_FIXEDMAP
               Use  a  fixed  address  for  the  mmap  region.  This  flag  must  be specified when creating the
               environment, and is stored persistently in the environment.  If successful, the memory  map  will
               always  reside  at  the  same  virtual  address  and pointers used to reference data items in the
               database will be constant across multiple invocations. This option may not always work, depending
               on how the operating system has allocated memory to shared libraries and other uses.  The feature
               is highly experimental.

           MDB_NOSUBDIR
               By default, LMDB creates its environment in a directory whose pathname is  given  in  <u>$path</u>,  and
               creates  its  data and lock files under that directory. With this option, <u>$path</u> is used as-is for
               the database main data file. The database lock file is the <u>$path</u> with "-lock" appended.

           MDB_RDONLY
               Open the environment in read-only mode. No write operations will  be  allowed.  LMDB  will  still
               modify the lock file - except on read-only filesystems, where LMDB does not use locks.

           MDB_WRITEMAP
               Use a writeable memory map unless "MDB_RDONLY" is set. This is faster and uses fewer mallocs, but
               loses  protection  from  application bugs like wild pointer writes and other bad updates into the
               database.

               Incompatible with nested transactions (also known as sub transactions).

           MDB_NOMETASYNC
               Flush system buffers to disk only once per transaction, omit the metadata flush. Defer that until
               the system flushes  files  to  disk,  or  next  non-MDB_RDONLY  commit  or  "$Env-&gt;sync()".  This
               optimization  maintains  database  integrity,  but  a  system  crash  may undo the last committed
               transaction. I.e. it preserves the ACI (atomicity, consistency, isolation) but not D (durability)
               database property.

               This flag may be changed at any time using "$Env-&gt;set_flags()".

           MDB_NOSYNC
               Don't flush system buffers to disk when committing a  transaction.   This  optimization  means  a
               system  crash  can  corrupt  the  database  or  lose the last transactions if buffers are not yet
               flushed to disk.  The risk is governed by how often the system flushes dirty buffers to disk  and
               how  often  "$Env-&gt;sync()"  is  called.  However, if the filesystem preserves write order and the
               "MDB_WRITEMAP" flag is not used, transactions exhibit  ACI  (atomicity,  consistency,  isolation)
               properties  and  only  lose  D (durability).  I.e. database integrity is maintained, but a system
               crash may undo the final transactions.  Note that "MDB_NOSYNC | MDB_WRITEMAP" leaves  the  system
               with  no  hint  for  when  to  write  transactions  to  disk,  unless  "$Env-&gt;sync()"  is called.
               "MDB_MAPASYNC | MDB_WRITEMAP") may be preferable.

               This flag may be changed at any time using "$Env-&gt;set_flags()".

           MDB_MAPASYNC
               When using "MDB_WRITEMAP", use asynchronous flushes to disk.   As  with  "MDB_NOSYNC",  a  system
               crash can then corrupt the database or lose the last transactions. Calling "$Env-&gt;sync()" ensures
               on-disk database integrity until next commit.

               This flag may be changed at any time using "$Env-&gt;set_flags()".

           MDB_NOTLS
               Don't  use  Thread-Local Storage. Tie reader locktable slots to "LMDB::Txn" objects instead of to
               threads. I.e. "$Txn-&gt;reset()" keeps the slot reserved for the "LMDB::Txn" object.  A  thread  may
               use  parallel  read-only  transactions.  A  read-only  transaction  may  span threads if the user
               synchronizes its use. Applications that multiplex many user threads over  individual  OS  threads
               need this option. Such an application must also serialize the write transactions in an OS thread,
               since LMDB's write locking is unaware of the user threads.

   <b>Class</b> <b>methods</b>
       $Env-&gt;copy ( $path )
           Copy an LMDB environment to the specified <u>$path</u>

       $Env-&gt;copyfd ( HANDLE )
           Copy an LMDB environment to the specified <b>HANDLE</b>.

       $status = $Env-&gt;stat
           Returns a HASH reference with statistics for the main, unnamed, database in the environment, the HASH
           contains the following keys:

           <b>psize</b> Size of a database page.
           <b>depth</b> Depth (height) of the B-Tree
           <b>branch_pages</b> Number of internal (non-leaf) pages
           <b>overflow_pages</b> Number of overflow pages
           <b>entries</b> Number of data items
       $info = $Env-&gt;info
           Returns a HASH reference with information about the environment, <u>$info</u>, with the following keys:

           <b>mapaddr</b> Address of map, if fixed
           <b>mapsize</b> Size of the data memory map
           <b>last_pgno</b> ID of the last used page
           <b>last_txnid</b> ID of the last committed transaction
           <b>maxreaders</b> Max reader slots in the environment
           <b>numreaders</b> Max reader slot used in the environment
       $Env-&gt;sync ( BOOL )
           Flush the data buffers to disk.

           Data  is always written to disk when "$Txn-&gt;commit()" is called, but the operating system may keep it
           buffered. LMDB always flushes the OS buffers upon commit as well, unless the environment  was  opened
           with "MDB_NOSYNC" or in part "MDB_NOMETASYNC".

           If  <u>BOOL</u>  is  TRUE force a synchronous flush.  Otherwise if the environment has the "MDB_NOSYNC" flag
           set the flushes will be omitted, and with "MDB_MAPASYNC" they will be asynchronous.

       $Env-&gt;set_flags ( BITMASK, BOOL )
           As noted above, some environment flags can be changed at any time.

           <u>BITMASK</u> is the flags to change, bitwise OR'ed together.  <u>BOOL</u> TRUE set the flags, FALSE clears them.

       $Env-&gt;get_flags ( $flags )
           Returns in <u>$flags</u> the environment flags.

       $Env-&gt;get_path ( $path )
           Returns in <u>$path</u> the path that was used in "LMDB::Env-&gt;new(...)"

       $Env-&gt;get_maxreaders ( $readers )
           Returns in <u>$readers</u> the maximum number of threads/reader slots for the environment

       $mks = $Env-&gt;get_maxkeysize
           Returns the maximum size of a key for the environment.

       $Txn = $Env-&gt;BeginTxn ( [ $tflags ] )
           Returns a new Transaction. A simple wrapper over the constructor of "LMDB::Txn".

           If provided, $tflags will be passed to the constructor, if not provided, this wrapper will  propagate
           the environment's flag "MDB_RDONLY", if set, to the transaction constructor.

</pre><h4><b>LMDB::Txn</b></h4><pre>
       In  LMDB every operation (read or write) on a Database needs to be inside a <b>transaction</b>. This class wraps
       an LMDB transaction.

       You must terminate the transaction by either the "abort" or "commit"  methods.  After  a  transaction  is
       terminated, you should not call any other method on it, except "env".

       If you let an object of this class get out of scope, by default the transaction will be aborted.

   <b>Constructor</b>
        $Txn = LMDB::Txn-&gt;new ( $Env [, $tflags ] )

       Create a new <b>transaction</b> for use in the <b>environment</b>.

   <b>Class</b> <b>methods</b>
       $Txn-&gt;abort
           Abort the transaction, terminating the transaction.

       $Txn-&gt;commit
           Commit the transaction, terminating the transaction.

       $Txn-&gt;reset
           Reset a read-only transaction.

           Abort  the transaction like "$Txn-&gt;abort()", but keep the transaction handle in the inactive state so
           "$Txn-&gt;renew()" may reactivate the handle.

           This saves allocation overhead if the process will start a new read-only transaction soon,  and  also
           saves locking overhead if MDB_NOTLS is in use.

           The  reader  table  lock is released, but the table slot stays tied to its thread or Transaction. Use
           "$Txn-&gt;abort()" to discard a reseted handle, and to free its lock table slot if MDB_NOTLS is in use.

       $Txn-&gt;renew
           Renew a read-only transaction.

           This  acquires  a  new  reader  lock  for  a  transaction  handle  that  had  been   inactivated   by
           "$Txn-&gt;reset()". It must be called before an inactive (reseted) transaction may be used again.

           In  this  Perl  implementation  if  you  call  "$Txn-&gt;renew()"  in  an  active Transaction the method
           internally calls "$Txn-&gt;reset()" for you.

       $Env = $Txn-&gt;env
           Returns the environment (an LMDB::Env object) that created the transaction, if it is still alive,  or
           "undef" if called on a terminated transaction.

       $SubTxn = $Txn-&gt;SubTxn ( [ $tflags ] )
           Creates and returns a sub transaction (also known as a nested transaction).

           Nested  transactions  are  useful  for  combining  components that create and commit transactions. No
           modifications are permanently stored until the  highest  level  "parent"  transaction  is  committed.
           Nested  transactions can be aborted without aborting the parent transaction and only the changes made
           in the nested transaction will be rolled-back.

           Aborting the parent transaction  will  abort  and  terminate  all  outstanding  nested  transactions.
           Committing  the  parent  transaction  will  similarly  commit  and  terminate  all outstanding nested
           transactions.

           Unlike some other databases, in LMDB changes made inside nested transactions are not visible  to  the
           parent transaction until the nested transaction is committed. In other words, transactions are always
           isolated, even when they are nested.

       $Txn-&gt;AutoCommit ( [ BOOL ] )
           When  <u>BOOL</u>  is  provided,  it sets the behavior of the transaction when going out of scope: <u>BOOL</u> TRUE
           makes arrangements for the transaction to be auto committed and <u>BOOL</u> FALSE  returns  to  the  default
           behavior: to be aborted.

           If you don't provide <u>BOOL</u>, you are only interested in knowing the current value of this option, which
           is returned in every case.

       $DB = $Txn-&gt;OpenDB ( [ DBOPTIONS ] )
       $DB = $Txn-&gt;OpenDB ( [ $dbname [, DBFLAGS ]] )
           This  method  opens  a Database in the environment and returns a "LMDB_File" object that encapsulates
           both the Transaction and the Database handler.

           This is a convenience shortcut for "LMDB_File-&gt;new( $Txn, $Txn-&gt;open(...) )" for use when you want to
           use the hi-level LMDB_File's OO approach.

           <b>DBOPTIONS</b>, if provided,  should be a HASH reference with any of the following keys:

           <b>dbname</b> =&gt; $dbname
           <b>flags</b> =&gt; DBFLAGS

           You can also call this method using its values, <u>$dbname</u> and <b>DBFLAGS</b>, documented ahead.

       $dbi = $Txn-&gt;open ( [ $dbname [, DBFLAGS ]] )
           This method open a Database in the environment  and  returns  the  low  level  Database  handler,  an
           integer.

           If  provided <u>$dbname</u>, will be the name of a named Database in the environment, if not provided (or if
           <u>$dbname</u> is "undef"), the opened Database will be the unnamed (the default) one.

           <b>DBFLAGS</b>, if provided, will set special options for this Database and can be specified by  OR'ing  the
           following flags:

           MDB_REVERSEKEY
               Keys are strings to be compared in reverse order

           MDB_DUPSORT
               Duplicate keys may be used in the database. (Or, from another perspective, keys may have multiple
               data  items,  stored  in sorted order.) By default keys must be unique and may have only a single
               data item.

           MDB_INTEGERKEY
               Keys are binary integers in native byte order.

           MDB_DUPFIXED
               This flag may only be used in combination with #MDB_DUPSORT. This option tells the  library  that
               the  data  items  for  this database are all the same size, which allows further optimizations in
               storage and retrieval. When  all  data  items  are  the  same  size,  the  #MDB_GET_MULTIPLE  and
               #MDB_NEXT_MULTIPLE cursor operations may be used to retrieve multiple items at once.

           MDB_INTEGERDUP
               This option specifies that duplicate data items are also integers, and should be sorted as such.

           MDB_REVERSEDUP
               This option specifies that duplicate data items should be compared as strings in reverse order.

           MDB_CREATE
               Create  the  named  database  if  it  doesn't  exist.  This  option is not allowed in a read-only
               transaction or a read-only environment.

               After successfully commit the transaction that created the Database, it will  remains  opened  in
               the Environment so you can reuse <u>$dbi</u> in other transactions.

           If  you  will  need  to  use that Database handler in more than one transaction or want to use a more
           traditional (in LMDB's point of view) approach, this the method you should use.

           To operate in the opened database with the returned <u>$dbi</u> handler you can use  the  methods  described
           bellow  or  call  "LMDB_File-&gt;new(...)"  to  obtain a "LMDB_File" object to operate the database in a
           particular transaction.

       $Txn-&gt;put ( $dbi, $key, $data [, WRITEFLAGS [, $length ] )
           Store items into the database <u>$dbi</u>

           Provided for when your main concern is the raw speed.

           For details of the other arguments, please see the method of the same name in LMDB_File below.

       $Txn-&gt;get ( $dbi, $key, $data )
           Get items from the database <u>$dbi</u>

           Provided for when your main concern is the raw speed.

           For details of the other arguments, please see the method of the same name in LMDB_File below.

       $Txn-&gt;id ()
           Return the transaction's ID.  This returns the identifier associated with  this  transaction.  For  a
           read-only  transaction,  this  corresponds  to  the  snapshot  being  read;  concurrent  readers will
           frequently have the same transaction ID.

</pre><h4><b>LMDB_File</b></h4><pre>
       In the LMDB C API all Database operations need both an active Transaction  and  a  Database  handler.  To
       simplify those operations and be syntax compatible with others *_File modules, this Perl API provides you
       a <b>LMDB_File</b> object that encapsulates both and implements some hi-level extensions.

       LMDB_File's  methods,  in  contrast  to the LMDB::Txn's ones of the same name, perform some checks before
       calling the low-level C API.

   <b>Constructors</b>
       $DB = LMDB_File-&gt;new( $Txn, $dbi )
           Associates a Transaction <u>$Txn</u> with a previously opened Database handler <u>$dbi</u> to use this OO API

       $DB = LMDB_File-&gt;open ( $Txn [, $dbname [, DBFLAGS ] ] )
           An alternative to "$Txn-&gt;OpenDB(...)" for open a Database and associate it with a Transaction in  one
           call.

   <b>Class</b> <b>methods</b>
       $DB-&gt;put ( $key, $data [, WRITEFLAGS [, $length ] ] )
           Store items into a database.

           This  function  stores  key/data  pairs  in  the  database.  The default behavior is to enter the new
           key/data pair, replacing any previously existing key  if  duplicates  are  disallowed,  or  adding  a
           duplicate data item if duplicates are allowed

           <u>$key</u> is the key to store in the database and <u>$data</u> the data to store.

           <b>WRITEFLAGS</b>,  if  provided,  will  set  special options for this operation and can be one of following
           flags:

           MDB_NODUPDATA
               Enter the new key/data pair only if it does not   already appear in the database.  This flag  may
               only  be  specified    if the database was opened with #MDB_DUPSORT.  The function will fail with
               MDB_KEYEXIST if the key/data pair already appears in the database.

           MDB_NOOVERWRITE
               Enter the new key/data pair only if the key does not already appear in the database.

               The function will return MDB_KEYEXIST if the key already appears in the database,  even  if   the
               database  supports  duplicates  (#MDB_DUPSORT).  The  <u>$data</u> parameter will be set to the existing
               item.

           MDB_RESERVE
               Reserve space for data of the given size in <u>$length</u>, but don't copy anything.  Instead, return in
               <u>$data</u> a magical scalar with a pointer to the reserved space, which the caller can fill in  later,
               but  before  the next update operation or the transaction ends. This saves an extra memcpy if the
               data is being generated later.

               In this particular case, you need to pass the extra <u>$length</u> parameter to specify how  many  bytes
               to reserve.

               Please read about the "$DB-&gt;ReadMode" method caveats bellow for details that apply to the magical
               scalar returned in <u>$data</u> in this case.

           MDB_APPEND
               Append the given key/data pair to the end of the database.

               No  key  comparisons  are  performed.  This option allows fast bulk loading when keys are already
               known to be in the correct order.

               <b>NOTE:</b> Loading unsorted keys with this flag will cause data corruption.

           MDB_APPENDDUP
               As above, but for sorted duplicated data.

       $DB-&gt;get ( $key, $data )
       $data = $DB-&gt;get ( $key )
           Get items from a database.

           This method retrieves key/data pairs from the database.

           If the database supports duplicate keys (#MDB_DUPSORT) then the first data item for the key  will  be
           returned. Retrieval of other items requires the use of the "LMBD::Cursor-&gt;get()" method.

           The  two-argument  form,  closer  to  the  C  API,  returns  in the provided argument <u>$data</u> the value
           associated with <u>$key</u> in the database if it exists or reports an error if not.

           In the simpler, more "perlish" one-argument form, the method returns the value associated  with  <u>$key</u>
           in the database or "undef" if no such value exists.

       $DB-&gt;del ( $key [, $data ] )
           Delete items from the database.

           This function removes key/data pairs from the database.

           If  the  database  does not support sorted duplicate data items, (MDB_DUPSORT) the <u>$data</u> parameter is
           optional and is ignored.

           If the database supports sorted duplicates and the <u>$data</u> parameter is "undef" or not provided, all of
           the duplicate data items for the <u>$key</u> will be deleted. Otherwise, if the <u>$data</u> parameter is  provided
           only the matching data item will be deleted.

       $DB-&gt;set_compare ( CODE )
           Set a custom key comparison function referenced by <u>CODE</u> for a database.

           <u>CODE</u>  should  be  a  subroutine  reference  or  an  anonymous  subroutine, that like Perl's "sort" in
           perlfunc, will receive the values to compare in the global variables $a and $b.

           The comparison function is called whenever it  is  necessary  to  compare  a  key  specified  by  the
           application with a key currently stored in the database.  If no comparison function is specified, and
           no  special  key  flags  were specified in "LMDB_File-&gt;open()", the keys are compared lexically, with
           shorter keys collating before longer keys.

           <b>Warning:</b> This function must be called before any data  access  functions  are  used,  otherwise  data
           corruption  may  occur.  The  same  comparison  function  must be used by every program accessing the
           database, every time the database is used.

       $flags = $DB-&gt;flags
           Retrieve the DB flags for the associated database.

       $status = $DB-&gt;stat
           Returns a HASH reference with statistics for the associated  database,  the  hash  will  contain  the
           following keys:

           <b>psize</b> Size of a database page.
           <b>depth</b> Depth (height) of the B-Tree
           <b>branch_pages</b> Number of internal (non-leaf) pages
           <b>overflow_pages</b> Number of overflow pages
           <b>entries</b> Number of data items
       $DB-&gt;drop( [ REMOVE ] )
           If  <u>REMOVE</u> isn't provided or FALSE, the database is emptied. If <u>REMOVE</u> is TRUE the database is closed
           and removed from the Environment.

       $DB-&gt;Alive
           Returns a TRUE value if the associated transaction is still alive, i.e.   not  commited  nor  aborted
           yet, and FALSE otherwise.

       $Cursor = $DB-&gt;Cursor
           Creates a new LMDB::Cursor object to work in the database, see "LMDB::Cursor"

       $txn = $DB-&gt;Txn
           Returns the transaction, an "LMDB::Txn" object, associated with <u>$DB</u>.

               $DB-&gt;Txn-&gt;commit; # Commit the current transaction.

           If the method "$DB-&gt;Alive" has returned FALSE before, this method will return "undef".

           You  can  use "$DB-&gt;Txn" as an lvalue to change the associated Transaction, but remember that, if $DB
           is holding the last reference of the current transaction, that transaction will be terminated.

               $DB-&gt;Txn-&gt;commit; # Commit current
               $DB-&gt;Alive;       # FALSE
               ...
               $DB-&gt;Txn = $Env-&gt;BeginTxn; # Start another, with same Database
               ...

       $dbi = $DB-&gt;dbi
           Returns the low level Database handler associated with <u>$DB</u>

           You can use "$DB-&gt;dbi" as an lvalue to switch the associated Datbase hander:

             $DB-&gt;dbi = $other_dbi;

       $DB-&gt;ReadMode ( [ MODE ] )
           This method allows you to modify the behavior of "get" (read) operations on the database.

           The C documentation for the "mdb_get" function states that:

             The memory pointed to by the returned values is owned by the
             database. The caller need not dispose of the memory, and may not
             modify it in any way. For values returned in a read-only transaction
             any modification attempts will cause a SIGSEGV.

           So this module implements two modes of operation for its "get" methods and  you  can  select  between
           them with this method.

           When  MODE  is  0 (or any FALSE value) a default "safe" mode is used in which the data value found in
           the database is copied to the scalar returned, so you can do anything you want to that scalar without
           side effects.

           But when MODE is 1 (or, in the current implementation, any TRUE value) a sort  of  hack  is  used  to
           avoid the memory copy and a magical scalar returned that hold only a pointer to the data value found.
           This is much faster and uses less memory, especially when used with large values.

           In  a  environment opened with MDB_WRITEMAP and in a transaction without the MDB_RDONLY flag, you are
           allowed to modify the returned scalar, and the modifications are reflected to the  associated  memory
           block and preserved in the database when the transaction is commited. Otherwise the magical scalar is
           marked  READ-ONLY  and  any  attempt  to modify it (other than reuse it in another "$DB-&gt;get" ), will
           cause perl to croak.

           <b>CAVEATS:</b> In a read-only transaction the value is valid only until the end of the transaction, and  in
           a  read-write  transaction  the value is valid only until the next write operation (because any write
           operation can potentially modify the  in-memory  btree).  In  the  current  implementation,  you  are
           responsible for the proper timing of usage.

           <b>NOTE:</b>  In  order  to achieve the zero-copy behavior desired by setting ReadMode to TRUE, you must use
           the two-argument form of get ("$DB-&gt;get ( $key, $data )"), use the new "$DB-&gt;Rget( $key )" or use the
           cursor get method described below.

       $DB-&gt;UTF8 ( [ MODE ] )
           Instructs LDMB_File to use the UTF-8 encoding for the associated database when <u>MODE</u> is 1 or revert to
           raw bytes when 0.

           Returns the previous value.

           By default, all values in LMDB are simple byte buffers of certain fixed length.

           So if you are storing binary data in your database all works as expected: what you put  is  what  you
           get.

           But  when  you  need to store some arbitrary Unicode text value, remember that internally perl stores
           your strings in either the native eight-bit character set or in UTF-8, and to  warrant  a  consistent
           encoding in your database you should do something like:

               use Encoding;
               ...

               $DB-&gt;put($key, Encode::encode($my_encoding, $characters));

               $characters = Encode::decode($my_encoding, $DB-&gt;get($key));

           For any value of $my_encoding, see Encode for the gory details.

           But if you use for interchange the UTF-8 encoding, with this method you can avoid all that typing.

           When  <u>MODE</u>  is 1, all values that you put in the Database will be encoded in UTF-8, And all get calls
           will expect UTF-8 data and it will be verified and decoded.  In  this  mode,  if  malformed  data  is
           found, a warning will be emitted, the decode attempt aborted and the raw bytes returned.

           In  this  mode,  a  "$foo-&gt;get(...)"  call  interacts  with the bytes pragma in a special way: In the
           lexical scope under the effects of "use bytes", any get call skips the  decode  step,  returning  the
           fetched  encoded  UTF-8  data  as  bytes,  i.e.  with the internal perl UTF8 flag off, as expected by
           modules like JSON::XS.

</pre><h4><b>LMDB::Cursor</b></h4><pre>
       To construct a cursor you should call the "Cursor" method of the "LMDB_File" class:

        $cursor = $DB-&gt;Cursor

   <b>Class</b> <b>methods</b>
       $cursor-&gt;get($key, $data, CURSOR_OP)
           This function retrieves key/data pairs from the database.

           The variables <u>$key</u> and <u>$data</u> are used to return the values found.

           <b>CURSOR_OP</b> determines the key/data to be retrieved and must be one of the following:

           MDB_FIRST
               Position at first key/data item.

           MDB_FIRST_DUP
               Position at first data item of current key. Only for "MDB_DUPSORT"

           MDB_GET_BOTH
               Position at key/data pair. Only for "MDB_DUPSORT"

           MDB_GET_BOTH_RANGE
               Position at key, nearest data. Only for "MDB_DUPSORT"

           MDB_GET_CURRENT
               Return key/data at current cursor position.

           MDB_GET_MULTIPLE
               Return all the duplicate data items at the current cursor position.  Only for "MDB_DUPFIXED"

           MDB_LAST
               Position at last key/data item.

           MDB_LAST_DUP
               Position at last data item of current key. Only for "MDB_DUPSORT"

           MDB_NEXT
               Position at next data item.

           MDB_NEXT_DUP
               Position at next data item of current key.  Only for "MDB_DUPSORT"

           MDB_NEXT_MULTIPLE
               Return all duplicate data items at the next cursor position. Only for "MDB_DUPFIXED"

           MDB_NEXT_NODUP
               Position at first data item of next key.

           MDB_PREV
               Position at previous data item.

           MDB_PREV_DUP
               Position at previous data item of current key. Only for "MDB_DUPSORT"

           MDB_PREV_NODUP
               Position at last data item of previous key.

           MDB_SET
               Position at specified key.

           MDB_SET_KEY
               Position at specified key, return key + data.

           MDB_SET_RANGE
               Position at first key greater than or equal to specified key.

       $cursor-&gt;put($key, $data, WRITEFLAGS)
           This function stores key/data pairs into the database.

           If the function succeeds and an item is inserted into the database, the cursor is  always  positioned
           to refer to the newly inserted item.

           If the function fails for any reason, the state of the cursor will undetermined.

           <b>NOTE:</b> Earlier documentation incorrectly said errors would leave the state of the cursor unchanged.

       $cursor-&gt;del( [ DELFLAGS ] )
           This function deletes the key/data pair to which the cursor refers.

           If the database was opened with "MDB_DUPSORT", the optional parameter <u>DELFLAGS</u> can be "MDB_NODUPDATA"
           to deletes all of the data items for the current key.

</pre><h4><b>TIE</b> <b>Interface</b></h4><pre>
       The simplest interface to LMDB is using "tie" in perlfunc.

       The TIE interface of LMDB_File can take several forms that depend on the data at hand.

       tie %hash, 'LMDB_File', $path [, $options ]
           The most simple form.

       tie %hash, 'LMDB_File', $path, $flags, $mode
           For compatibility with other DBM modules.

       tie %hash, 'LMDB_File', $Txn [, DBOPTIONS ]
           When you have a Transaction object <u>$Txn</u> at hand.

       tie %hash, 'LMDB_File', $Env [, DBOPTIONS ]
           When you have an Environment object <u>$Env</u> at hand.

       tie %hash, $DB
           When you have an opened Transaction encapsulated database.

       The first two forms will create and/or open the Environment at <u>$path</u>, create a new Transaction and open a
       Database in the Transaction.

       If provided, <u>$options</u> must be a HASH reference with options for both the Environment and the database.

       Valid keys for <u>$option</u> are any described above for <b>ENVOPTIONS</b> and <b>DBOPTIONS</b>.

       In  the  case  that  you  have  already  created  a transaction or an environment, you can provide a HASH
       reference in <b>DBOPTIONS</b> for options exclusively for the database.

       In the forms that needs to create a Transaction, this is setted for <b>Autocommit</b> mode.
