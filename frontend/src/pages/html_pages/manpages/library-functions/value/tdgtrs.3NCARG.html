</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       TDGTRS - Get the values defining a selected rendering style, which affects the appearance of triangles
       drawn by a call to the routine TDDTRI.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL TDGTRS (IRST, IFC1, IFC2, IFC3, IFC4, ILC1, ILC2, ILTD, USTP, VSTP, WSTP)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_tdgtrs(int irst, int *ifc1, int *ifc2, int *ifc3, int *ifc4, int *ilc1, int *ilc2, int *iltd,
       float *ustp, float *vstp, float *wstp)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The arguments of TDGTRS are as follows:

       IRST    (an  input  expression of type INTEGER) - the index of the particular rendering style which is to
               be retrieved.

       IFC1 and IFC2
               (input expressions of type INTEGER) - color indices specifying a range of colors to be  used  for
               the "bottom" side of a surface (where function values are less than the value on the surface). If
               IFC1  is  negative, filling of triangles seen from the "bottom" is turned off. If IFC1 is zero or
               greater, but IFC2 is less than or equal to it, the color with index IFC1 is used. If IFC1 is zero
               or greater and IFC2 is greater than IFC1, then a range of color indices is specified; colors near
               the beginning of that range are used for triangles that are nearly perpendicular to the  line  of
               sight, while colors near the end of that range are used for triangles more nearly parallel to the
               line  of  sight.  (Normally, one should make triangles perpendicular to the line of sight lighter
               than those parallel to the line of sight.)

       IFC3 and IFC4
               (input expressions of type INTEGER) - color indices specifying a range of colors to be  used  for
               the "top" side of a surface (where function values are greater than the value on the surface). If
               IFC3  is  negative,  filling  of  triangles seen from the "top" is turned off. If IFC3 is zero or
               greater, but IFC4 is less than or equal to it, the color with index IFC3 is used. If IFC3 is zero
               or greater and IFC4 is greater than IFC3, then a range of color indices is specified; colors near
               the beginning of that range are used for triangles that are nearly perpendicular to the  line  of
               sight, while colors near the end of that range are used for triangles more nearly parallel to the
               line  of  sight.  (Normally, one should make triangles perpendicular to the line of sight lighter
               than those parallel to the line of sight.)

       ILC1    (an input expression of type INTEGER) - the color index specifying a color to be used  for  lines
               drawn  on  the  "bottom"  side  of a surface.  If ILC1 is negative, the drawing of these lines is
               turned off.

       ILC2    (an input expression of type INTEGER) - the color index specifying a color to be used  for  lines
               drawn  on the "top" side of a surface.  If ILC2 is negative, the drawing of these lines is turned
               off.

       ILTD    (an input expression of type INTEGER) - a flag, which, if set non-zero, turns on the  drawing  of
               the edges of the individual triangles into which surfaces have been decomposed.

       USTP, VSTP, and WSTP
               (input  expressions  of  type REAL) - the distances between slices in the U, V, and W directions,
               respectively. If a given value is zero, the associated slice lines are not drawn.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use TDGTRS or c_tdgtrs, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably  in
       that order.
