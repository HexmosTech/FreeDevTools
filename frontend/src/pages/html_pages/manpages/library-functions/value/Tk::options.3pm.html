       Tk::options - Standard options supported by widgets and their manipulation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           <u>$value</u> = <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>cget</b>('<u>-option</u>');

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>configure</b>(<u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u> ?,<u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u> ...?);

           <u>@list</u> = <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>configure</b>('<u>-option</u>');

           <u>@lol</u> = <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>configure</b>;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       All widgets, and images have a standard mechanism for setting and querying attibutes or options. The
       mechanism is based on two methods <b>configure</b> and <b>cget</b>. The behaviour of these methods is as follows:

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>configure</b>(<u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u> ?,<u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u> ...?);
           Sets  the  values  of  <u>-option</u> to <u>value</u> for each <u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u> pair. The internal <b>new</b> method does an
           implicit <b>configure</b> in this form with options passed in at widget create time.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>configure</b>('<u>-option</u>')
           In array context returns a list of five or two elements.  If <u>-option</u> is an alias for another  options
           it return a list consisting of the alias option and the name for the option is is an alias for, e.g.,
           "('-bg',  'background')".   If  <u>-option</u>  is  not  an  alias  the returned list has the following five
           elements:

           <u>Option</u> <u>Name</u>
                   The value of <u>-option</u>, e.g., <b>-background</b>.

           <u>Name</u>    The option's name in the option database, e.g., "background".

           <u>Class</u>   The option's class value in the option database, e.g., "Background".

           <u>Default</u> The default value for the option if not specified or in the option database, e.g., "grey".

           <u>Value</u>   The current value (as returned by <b>cget</b>), e.g., "white".

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>configure</b>
           Returns a list of lists for all the options supported by <u>$widget</u>.   Each  sub-list  is  in  the  form
           returned  by <b>configure</b>('<u>-option</u>').  (This mechanism is used by the <b>Tk::Derived</b> class to determine the
           options available from base class.)

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>cget</b>('<u>-option</u>')
           Returns the current value of <u>-option</u> for <u>$widget</u>.

           <b>cget</b>('<u>-option</u>') is clumsy with the need for <b>''</b> due to perl's parsing  rules.  Something  more  subtle
           using tie might look better.

       The  following  paragraphs  describe  the  common  configuration  options  supported by widgets in the Tk
       toolkit.  Every widget does not necessarily support every option (see the the documentation  entries  for
       individual  widgets  for  a  list of the standard options supported by that widget), but if a widget does
       support an option with one of the names listed below, then the option has exactly  the  effect  described
       below.

       In the descriptions below, ``Name'' refers to the option's name in the option database.  ``Class'' refers
       to  the  option's  class  value  in the option database.  ``Switch'' refers to the switch used in widget-
       creation and <b>configure</b> widget methods to set this value. For example, if an option's configure option  is
       <b>-foreground</b> and there exists a widget <u>$widget</u>, then the call:

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>configure</b>(<b>-foreground</b>=&gt;<b>'black'</b>)

       may  be  used  to specify the value <b>black</b> for the option in the widget <u>$widget</u>.  Configure options may be
       abbreviated, as long as the abbreviation is unambiguous (abbreviation is deprecated in perl/Tk).

   <b>Creation</b> <b>options:</b> <b>Widget</b> <b>Name</b> <b>and</b> <b>Class</b>
       The <b>Name</b> and <b>-class</b> options can only be specified when a widget is created, and cannot  be  changed  with
       <b>configure</b>.   These  options  determine  the widget's identity and how Tk applies resource values from the
       option database (see Tk::option) and so they cannot be assigned by the options database.

       Name:     <u>name</u>
       Switch:   <b>Name</b>
           Specifies the path element for the widget.  Names generally begin with a lowercase letter.

           Each widget has a unique <u>pathname</u> that follows the  hierarchy  from  the  <b>MainWindow</b>  to  the  widget
           itself.   Since  the  widget's  <b>PathName</b>  is  used to assign options from the options database, it is
           important to specify a distinctive <b>Name</b> for any widget  that  will  have  non-default  options.   See
           Tk::option for details.

       Name:     <u>class</u>
       Switch:   <b>-class</b>
           Specifies a class for the window.  Classes generally begin with an uppercase letter.

           This  class  will  be  used  when  querying  the  option database for the window's other options (see
           Tk::options), and it will also be used later for other purposes  such  as  bindings.   One  typically
           assigns a class to a <b>TopLevel</b> or <b>Frame</b> so that the class will apply to all of that widget's children.

   <b>Reconfigurable</b> <b>options</b>
       These options can be set at widget creation or changed later via <b>configure</b>.

       Name:     <b>activeBackground</b>
       Class:    <b>Foreground</b>
       Switch:   <b>-activebackground</b>
           Specifies background color to use when drawing active elements.  An element (a widget or portion of a
           widget) is active if the mouse cursor is positioned over the element and pressing a mouse button will
           cause  some  action  to  occur.   If  strict  Motif  compliance  has  been  requested  by setting the
           <b>$Tk::strictMotif</b> variable, this option will normally be ignored;  the normal background color will be
           used instead.  For some elements on Windows and Macintosh systems, the active color will only be used
           while mouse button 1 is pressed over the element.

       Name:     <b>activeBorderWidth</b>
       Class:    <b>BorderWidth</b>
       Switch:   <b>-activeborderwidth</b>
           Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of the 3-D border drawn around  active  elements.
           See  above  for  definition  of  active  elements.  The value may have any of the forms acceptable to
           <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  This option is typically only available in widgets displaying more than one element at
           a time (e.g. menus but not buttons).

       Name:     <b>activeForeground</b>
       Class:    <b>Background</b>
       Switch:   <b>-activeforeground</b>
           Specifies foreground color to use when drawing active elements.  See above for definition  of  active
           elements.

       Name:     <b>activetile</b>
       Class:    <b>Tile</b>
       Switch:   <b>-activetile</b>
           Specifies  image  used  to display inside active elements of the widget.  See above for definition of
           active elements.

       Name:     <b>anchor</b>
       Class:    <b>Anchor</b>
       Switch:   <b>-anchor</b>
           Specifies how the information in a widget (e.g. text or a bitmap) is to be displayed in  the  widget.
           Must  be  one of the values <b>n</b>, <b>ne</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>se</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>sw</b>, <b>w</b>, <b>nw</b>, or <b>center</b>.  For example, <b>nw</b> means display the
           information such that its top-left corner is at the top-left corner of the widget.

       Name:     <b>background</b>
       Class:    <b>Background</b>
       Switch:   <b>-background</b>
       Alias:    <b>-bg</b>
           Specifies the normal background color to use when displaying the widget.

       Name:     <b>bitmap</b>
       Class:    <b>Bitmap</b>
       Switch:   <b>-bitmap</b>
           Specifies a bitmap to display in the widget, in any of the forms  acceptable  to  <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.   The
           exact  way  in  which  the  bitmap  is  displayed may be affected by other options such as <b>-anchor</b> or
           <b>-justify</b>.  Typically, if this option is specified then it overrides  other  options  that  specify  a
           textual  value  to  display  in the widget; the <b>-bitmap</b> option may be reset to an empty string to re-
           enable a text display.  In widgets that support both <b>-bitmap</b> and <b>-image</b> options, <b>-image</b> will  usually
           override <b>-bitmap</b>.

       Name:     <b>borderWidth</b>
       Class:    <b>BorderWidth</b>
       Switch:   <b>-borderwidth</b>
       Alias:    <b>-bd</b>
           Specifies  a  non-negative value indicating the width of the 3-D border to draw around the outside of
           the widget (if such a border is being drawn;  the <b>relief</b>  option  typically  determines  this).   The
           value  may  also  be used when drawing 3-D effects in the interior of the widget.  The value may have
           any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.

       Name:     <b>compound</b>
       Class:    <b>Compound</b>
       Switch:   <b>-compound</b>
           Specifies if the widget should display text and bitmaps/images at the same time, and if so, where the
           bitmap/image should be placed relative to the text. Must be one of  the  values  <b>none</b>,  <b>bottom</b>,  <b>top</b>,
           <b>left</b>,  <b>right</b>,  or  <b>center</b>.  For  example, the (default) value <b>none</b> specifies that the bitmap or image
           should (if defined) be displayed instead of the text, the value <b>left</b> specifies  that  the  bitmap  or
           image  should be displayed to the left of the text, and the value <b>center</b> specifies that the bitmap or
           image should be displayed on top of the text.

       Name:     <b>cursor</b>
       Class:    <b>Cursor</b>
       Switch:   <b>-cursor</b>
           Specifies the mouse cursor to be used for the widget.  The value may have any of the forms acceptable
           to <b>Tk_GetCursor</b>.

       Name:     <b>dash</b>
       Class:    <b>Dash</b>
       Switch:   <b>-dash</b>
           The value may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetDash</b>, such as <b>4</b>, <b>[6,4]</b>, <b>.</b>, <b>-</b>, <b>-.</b>, or <b>-..</b>.

       Name:     <b>dashoffset</b>
       Class:    <b>Dashoffset</b>
       Switch:   <b>-dashoffset</b>
           Specifies the offset in the dash list where the drawing starts.

       Name:     <b>disabledForeground</b>
       Class:    <b>DisabledForeground</b>
       Switch:   <b>-disabledforeground</b>
           Specifies foreground color to use when drawing a disabled element.  If the option is specified as  an
           empty  string  (which is typically the case on monochrome displays), disabled elements are drawn with
           the normal foreground color but they are dimmed by drawing them with a stippled fill pattern.

       Name:     <b>disabledtile</b>
       Class:    <b>Tile</b>
       Switch:   <b>-disabledtile</b>
           Specifies image to use when drawing a disabled element.

       Name:     <b>exportSelection</b>
       Class:    <b>ExportSelection</b>
       Switch:   <b>-exportselection</b>
           Specifies whether or not a selection in the widget should also be the X  selection.   The  value  may
           have  any  of  the  forms  accepted by <b>Tcl_GetBoolean</b>, such as <b>true</b>, <b>false</b>, <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>yes</b>, or <b>no</b>.  If the
           selection is exported, then selecting in the widget deselects  the  current  X  selection,  selecting
           outside the widget deselects any widget selection, and the widget will respond to selection retrieval
           requests when it has a selection.  The default is usually for widgets to export selections.

       Name:     <b>font</b>
       Class:    <b>Font</b>
       Switch:   <b>-font</b>
           Specifies the font to use when drawing text inside the widget.

       Name:     <b>foreground</b>
       Class:    <b>Foreground</b>
       Switch:   <b>-foreground</b>
       Alias:    <b>-fg</b>
           Specifies the normal foreground color to use when displaying the widget.

       Name:     <b>highlightBackground</b>
       Class:    <b>HighlightBackground</b>
       Switch:   <b>-highlightbackground</b>
           Specifies  the  color  to display in the traversal highlight region when the widget does not have the
           input focus.

       Name:     <b>highlightColor</b>
       Class:    <b>HighlightColor</b>
       Switch:   <b>-highlightcolor</b>
           Specifies the color to use for the traversal highlight rectangle that is drawn around the widget when
           it has the input focus.

       Name:     <b>highlightThickness</b>
       Class:    <b>HighlightThickness</b>
       Switch:   <b>-highlightthickness</b>
           Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of the highlight rectangle  to  draw  around  the
           outside of the widget when it has the input focus.  The value may have any of the forms acceptable to
           <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  If the value is zero, no focus highlight is drawn around the widget.

       Name:     <b>image</b>
       Class:    <b>Image</b>
       Switch:   <b>-image</b>
           Specifies  an image to display in the widget, which must have been created with an image create. (See
           Tk::Image for details of image creation.)  Typically, if the  <b>-image</b>  option  is  specified  then  it
           overrides  other  options that specify a bitmap or textual value to display in the widget; the <b>-image</b>
           option may be reset to an empty string to re-enable a bitmap or text display.

       Name:     <b>insertBackground</b>
       Class:    <b>Foreground</b>
       Switch:   <b>-insertbackground</b>
           Specifies the color to use as background in the area covered by the  insertion  cursor.   This  color
           will  normally  override  either the normal background for the widget (or the selection background if
           the insertion cursor happens to fall in the selection).

       Name:     <b>insertBorderWidth</b>
       Class:    <b>BorderWidth</b>
       Switch:   <b>-insertborderwidth</b>
           Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of the 3-D border to draw  around  the  insertion
           cursor.  The value may have any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.

       Name:     <b>insertOffTime</b>
       Class:    <b>OffTime</b>
       Switch:   <b>-insertofftime</b>
           Specifies  a  non-negative  integer  value indicating the number of milliseconds the insertion cursor
           should remain ``off'' in each blink cycle.  If this option is zero then the cursor doesn't blink:  it
           is on all the time.

       Name:     <b>insertOnTime</b>
       Class:    <b>OnTime</b>
       Switch:   <b>-insertontime</b>
           Specifies a non-negative integer value indicating the number of  milliseconds  the  insertion  cursor
           should remain ``on'' in each blink cycle.

       Name:     <b>insertWidth</b>
       Class:    <b>InsertWidth</b>
       Switch:   <b>-insertwidth</b>
           Specifies a  value indicating the total width of the insertion cursor.  The value may have any of the
           forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  If a border has been specified for the insertion cursor (using the
           <b>insertBorderWidth</b>  option),  the  border  will be drawn inside the width specified by the <b>insertWidth</b>
           option.

       Name:     <b>jump</b>
       Class:    <b>Jump</b>
       Switch:   <b>-jump</b>
           For widgets with a slider that can be dragged to adjust a value,  such  as  scrollbars,  this  option
           determines  when  notifications  are  made  about changes in the value.  The option's value must be a
           boolean of the form accepted by <b>Tcl_GetBoolean</b>.  If the value is false, updates are made continuously
           as the slider is dragged.  If the value is true, updates  are  delayed  until  the  mouse  button  is
           released  to  end  the drag;  at that point a single notification is made (the value ``jumps'' rather
           than changing smoothly).

       Name:     <b>justify</b>
       Class:    <b>Justify</b>
       Switch:   <b>-justify</b>
           When there are multiple lines of text displayed in a widget, this option  determines  how  the  lines
           line  up  with  each  other.  Must be one of <b>left</b>, <b>center</b>, or <b>right</b>.  <b>Left</b> means that the lines' left
           edges all line up, <b>center</b> means that the lines' centers are aligned, and <b>right</b> means that the  lines'
           right edges line up.

       Name:     <b>offset</b>
       Class:    <b>Offset</b>
       Switch:   <b>-offset</b>
           Specifies  the offset of tiles (see also <b>-tile</b> option). It can have two different formats <b>-offset</b> <b>x,y</b>
           or <b>-offset</b> <b>side</b>, where side can be <b>n</b>, <b>ne</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>se</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>sw</b>, <b>w</b>, <b>nw</b>, or  <b>center</b>.  In  the  first  case  the
           origin is the origin of the toplevel of the current window.  For the canvas itself and canvas objects
           the  origin  is  the canvas origin, but putting <b>#</b> in front of the coordinate pair indicates using the
           toplevel origin in stead. For canvas objects, the <b>-offset</b> option is used for stippling as well.   For
           the  line  and  polygon  canvas  items  you can also specify an index as argument, which connects the
           stipple or tile origin to one of the coordinate points of the line/polygon.

       Name:     <b>orient</b>
       Class:    <b>Orient</b>
       Switch:   <b>-orient</b>
           For widgets that can lay themselves out with either a horizontal or  vertical  orientation,  such  as
           scrollbars,  this  option  specifies  which orientation should be used.  Must be either <b>horizontal</b> or
           <b>vertical</b> or an abbreviation of one of these.

       Name:     <b>padX</b>
       Class:    <b>Pad</b>
       Switch:   <b>-padx</b>
           Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space to  request  for  the  widget  in  the
           X-direction.   The  value  may  have any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  When computing how
           large a window it needs, the widget will add this amount to the width  it  would  normally  need  (as
           determined  by the width of the things displayed in the widget);  if the geometry manager can satisfy
           this request, the widget will end up with extra internal space to the left and/or right  of  what  it
           displays  inside.   Most  widgets  only  use  this option for padding text:  if they are displaying a
           bitmap or image, then they usually ignore padding options.

       Name:     <b>padY</b>
       Class:    <b>Pad</b>
       Switch:   <b>-pady</b>
           Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space to  request  for  the  widget  in  the
           Y-direction.   The  value  may  have any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  When computing how
           large a window it needs, the widget will add this amount to the height it  would  normally  need  (as
           determined by the height of the things displayed in the widget);  if the geometry manager can satisfy
           this  request,  the  widget will end up with extra internal space above and/or below what it displays
           inside.  Most widgets only use this option for padding text:  if they  are  displaying  a  bitmap  or
           image, then they usually ignore padding options.

       Name:     <b>relief</b>
       Class:    <b>Relief</b>
       Switch:   <b>-relief</b>
           Specifies  the 3-D effect desired for the widget.  Acceptable values are <b>raised</b>, <b>sunken</b>, <b>flat</b>, <b>ridge</b>,
           <b>solid</b>, and <b>groove</b>.  The value indicates how the interior of the widget should appear relative to  its
           exterior;   for  example,  <b>raised</b> means the interior of the widget should appear to protrude from the
           screen, relative to the exterior of the widget.

       Name:     <b>repeatDelay</b>
       Class:    <b>RepeatDelay</b>
       Switch:   <b>-repeatdelay</b>
           Specifies the number of milliseconds a button or key must be held down  before  it  begins  to  auto-
           repeat.  Used, for example, on the up- and down-arrows in scrollbars.

       Name:     <b>repeatInterval</b>
       Class:    <b>RepeatInterval</b>
       Switch:   <b>-repeatinterval</b>
           Used  in conjunction with <b>repeatDelay</b>:  once auto-repeat begins, this option determines the number of

       Name:     <b>selectBackground</b>
       Class:    <b>Foreground</b>
       Switch:   <b>-selectbackground</b>
           Specifies the background color to use when displaying selected items.

       Name:     <b>selectBorderWidth</b>
       Class:    <b>BorderWidth</b>
       Switch:   <b>-selectborderwidth</b>
           Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of the 3-D border to draw around selected  items.
           The value may have any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.

       Name:     <b>selectForeground</b>
       Class:    <b>Background</b>
       Switch:   <b>-selectforeground</b>
           Specifies the foreground color to use when displaying selected items.

       Name:     <b>setGrid</b>
       Class:    <b>SetGrid</b>
       Switch:   <b>-setgrid</b>
           Specifies a boolean value that determines whether this widget controls the resizing grid for its top-
           level window.  This option is typically used in text widgets, where the information in the widget has
           a  natural  size  (the  size  of  a  character)  and it makes sense for the window's dimensions to be
           integral numbers of these units.  These natural window sizes form a grid.  If the <b>setGrid</b>  option  is
           set  to  true  then  the  widget  will  communicate  with  the  window  manager so that when the user
           interactively resizes the top-level window that contains the widget, the  dimensions  of  the  window
           will  be  displayed  to  the  user  in grid units and the window size will be constrained to integral
           numbers of grid units.  See "GRIDDED GEOMETRY MANAGEMENT" in Tk::Wm for more details.

       Name:     <b>takeFocus</b>
       Class:    <b>TakeFocus</b>
       Switch:   <b>-takefocus</b>
           Determines whether the window accepts the focus during keyboard traversal (e.g., Tab and  Shift-Tab).
           Before  setting  the  focus  to  a  window,  the traversal scripts consult the value of the <b>takeFocus</b>
           option.  A value of <b>0</b> means that the window should be skipped entirely during keyboard traversal.   <b>1</b>
           means  that  the  window  should receive the input focus as long as it is viewable (it and all of its
           ancestors are mapped).  An empty value for the option means  that  the  traversal  scripts  make  the
           decision about whether or not to focus on the window:  the current algorithm is to skip the window if
           it  is  disabled,  if  it  has no key bindings, or if it is not viewable.  If the value has any other
           form, then the traversal scripts take the value, append  the  name  of  the  window  to  it  (with  a
           separator  space),  and evaluate the resulting string as a Callback.  The script must return <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, or
           an empty string:  a <b>0</b> or <b>1</b> value specifies whether the window will receive the input  focus,  and  an
           empty  string  results  in  the  default  decision described above.  Note: this interpretation of the
           option is defined entirely by the Callbacks that implement  traversal:   the  widget  implementations
           ignore  the  option  entirely,  so  you can change its meaning if you redefine the keyboard traversal
           scripts.

       Name:     <b>text</b>
       Class:    <b>Text</b>
       Switch:   <b>-text</b>
           Specifies a string to be displayed inside the widget.  The way  in  which  the  string  is  displayed
           depends on the particular widget and may be determined by other options, such as <b>anchor</b> or <b>justify</b>.

       Name:     <b>textVariable</b>
       Class:    <b>Variable</b>
       Switch:   <b>-textvariable</b>
           Specifies  the name of a variable.  The value of the variable is a text string to be displayed inside
           the widget;  if the variable value changes then  the  widget  will  automatically  update  itself  to
           reflect  the  new  value.   The  way  in  which  the string is displayed in the widget depends on the
           particular widget and may be determined by other options, such as <b>anchor</b> or <b>justify</b>.

       Name:     <b>tile</b>
       Class:    <b>Tile</b>
       Switch:   <b>-tile</b>
           Specifies image used to display the widget. If image is the empty string, then the normal  background
           color is displayed.

       Name:     <b>troughColor</b>
       Class:    <b>Background</b>
       Switch:   <b>-troughcolor</b>
           Specifies the color to use for the rectangular trough areas in widgets such as scrollbars and scales.

       Name:     <b>troughTile</b>
       Class:    <b>Tile</b>
       Switch:   <b>-troughtile</b>
           Specifies  image  used  to  display in the rectangular trough areas in widgets such as scrollbars and
           scales.

       Name:     <b>underline</b>
       Class:    <b>Underline</b>
       Switch:   <b>-underline</b>
           Specifies the integer index of a character to underline in the widget.  This option is  used  by  the
           default bindings to implement keyboard traversal for menu buttons and menu entries.  0 corresponds to
           the first character of the text displayed in the widget, 1 to the next character, and so on.

       Name:     <b>wrapLength</b>
       Class:    <b>WrapLength</b>
       Switch:   <b>-wraplength</b>
           For  widgets  that  can  perform word-wrapping, this option specifies the maximum line length.  Lines
           that would exceed this length are wrapped onto the next line, so that no  line  is  longer  than  the
           specified  length.  The value may be specified in any of the standard forms for screen distances.  If
           this value is less than or equal to 0 then no wrapping is done:  lines will  break  only  at  newline
           characters in the text.

       Name:     <b>xScrollCommand</b>
       Class:    <b>ScrollCommand</b>
       Switch:   <b>-xscrollcommand</b>
           Specifies  a  callback used to communicate with horizontal scrollbars.  When the view in the widget's
           window changes (or whenever anything else occurs that could change the display in a  scrollbar,  such
           as  a change in the total size of the widget's contents), the widget will make a callback passing two
           numeric arguments in addition to any specified in the callback.  Each of the numbers  is  a  fraction
           between  0  and  1,  which  indicates  a  position in the document.  0 indicates the beginning of the
           document, 1 indicates the end, .333 indicates a position one third the way through the document,  and
           so  on.   The  first  fraction indicates the first information in the document that is visible in the
           window, and the second fraction indicates the  information  just  after  the  last  portion  that  is
           visible.   Typically the <b>xScrollCommand</b> option consists of the scrollbar widget object and the method
           ``set'' i.e. [<b>set</b> =&gt; <u>$sb</u>]: this will cause the scrollbar to be  updated  whenever  the  view  in  the
           window changes.  If this option is not specified, then no command will be executed.

       Name:     <b>yScrollCommand</b>
       Class:    <b>ScrollCommand</b>
       Switch:   <b>-yscrollcommand</b>
           Specifies a calback used to communicate with vertical scrollbars.  This option is treated in the same
           way  as  the <b>xScrollCommand</b> option, except that it is used for vertical scrollbars and is provided by
           widgets that support vertical scrolling.  See the description of <b>xScrollCommand</b> for  details  on  how
           this option is used.
