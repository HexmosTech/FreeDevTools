</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       AGCURV - Draws a curve in a manner specified by the current values of the control parameters - the
       primary parameters with default values or with values supplied by the user, and the secondary parameters
       with values computed by AGSTUP.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL AGCURV (XVEC,IIEX,YVEC,IIEY,NEXY,KDSH)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_agcurv (float *xvec, int iiex, float *yvec,
       int iiey, int nexy, int kdsh)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       XVEC        (a  singly-subscripted  input  array  of  type REAL), when IIEX is non-zero, contains NEXY X-
                   coordinate data - curve point 1 has X coordinate <a href="../man1/XVEC.1.html">XVEC</a>(1), curve  point  2  has  X  coordinate
                   XVEC(1+IIEX),  curve  point  3  has  X coordinate XVEC(1+IIEX*2), etc. When IIEX is zero, the
                   array XVEC is ignored - curve point 1 has X coordinate "1.", curve point 2 has  X  coordinate
                   "2.", etc.

                   If  the value of any X coordinate matches the current value of 'NULL/1.' (default - "1.E36"),
                   the corresponding point is considered to be missing - curve segments on either side  of  that
                   point are not drawn.

       IIEX        (an  input  expression  of  type  INTEGER), if non-zero, is the index increment between one X
                   coordinate in XVEC and the next. If IIEX is zero, the array XVEC  is  ignored,  as  described
                   above.

       YVEC        (a  singly-subscripted input array of type REAL) is just like XVEC, but provides Y coordinate
                   data.

       IIEY        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is just like IIEX, but describes the use  (or  non-use)
                   of YVEC.

       NEXY        (an  input  expression  of  type  INTEGER)  is the number of curve points - the number of X/Y
                   coordinate pairs to be used.

                   Note: If 'INVERT.' is given the value "1." (in place of its default value "0."), AGCURV  will
                   behave  as  if  the arguments XVEC and IIEX had been interchanged with the arguments YVEC and
                   IIEY, so that X-coordinate values refer to vertical distances,  and  Y-coordinate  values  to
                   horizontal  distances,  on the graph. This parameter affects AGSTUP in a similar manner, thus
                   allowing one to plot "X as a function of Y".

       KDSH        (an input expression of type INTEGER) specifies the dashed-line pattern to be used in drawing
                   the curve. (Since the routines DASHD, FRSTD, VECTD, and LASTD, in the package  Dashline,  are
                   used  to  draw  the  curve,  it may have its own particular dashed-line pattern.)  If KDSH is
                   zero, the user is assumed to have done his own call to DASHD; AGCURV will do no such call.

                   •   If KDSH is zero, the user is assumed to have done his own call to DASHD; AGCURV  will  do
                       no such call.

                   •   If  KDSH  is non-zero and negative, the function MOD(-KDSH-1,26)+1 determines which of 26
                       "alphabetic" patterns is to be used; each of these generates a solid line interrupted  by
                       one  of  the  letters  of the alphabet. The value 1 implies that an "A" will be used, the
                       value 2 that a "B" will be used, . . . the value 27 that an "A" will be used again, etc.

                   •   If KDSH is non-zero and positive, the function  MOD(KDSH-1,n)+1  determines  which  of  n
                       "user"  patterns  is  to  be  used; these n patterns are defined by the parameters in the
                       group named 'DASH.' - the default values specify one solid-line pattern.

                   Note: The routines EZY and EZXY, which draw one curve per call, always call AGCURV with  KDSH
                   =  1.  The  routines EZMY and EZMXY, which draw one or more curves per call, call AGCURV with
                   KDSH = ISIGN(p,q), where p is the number of the curve being drawn (p is between 1  and  MANY,
                   inclusive) and q is the current integral value of 'DASH/SELECTOR.'.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant example: agex13.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use AGCURV or c_agcurv, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.  To get smoother curves, drawn using spline interpolation, also load libdashsmth.o.  Or,  you
       can  use the ncargf77 command to compile your program and load the above libraries, then, to get smoother
       curves, use the -dashsmth option.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>

       messages.
