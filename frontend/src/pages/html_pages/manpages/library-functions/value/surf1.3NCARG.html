</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SURF1 - calculate values for SURF2 usage.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL  SURF1  (M, N, X, Y, Z, IZ, ZX1, ZXM, ZY1, ZYN, ZXY11, ZXYM1, ZXY1N, ZXYMN, ISLPSW, ZP, TEMP, SIGMA,
       IER)

       This subroutine calculates certain values that are used by SURF2 in order  to  compute  an  interpolatory
       surface  passing  through a rectangular grid of function values. The surface computed is a tensor product
       of splines under tension. To calculate actual interpolated values, SURF2 must be called.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       M           (integer, input) The number of grid lines in the X direction. (M &gt; 1)

       N           (integer, input) The number of grid lines in the Y direction. (N &gt; 1)

       X           (real, input) An array containing M X coordinates for grid lines in the  X  direction.  These
                   values must be strictly increasing.

       Y           (real,  input)  An  array containing N Y coordinates for grid lines in the Y direction. These
                   values must be strictly increasing.

       Z           (real, input) An array containing M x N functional values at the grid points; Z(I,J) contains
                   the functional value at (X(I),Y(J)) for I=1,M and J=1,N.

       IZ          (integer, input) The row dimension of the matrix Z (IZ is greater than or equal to M).

       ZX1         (real, input) An array containing N X-partial derivatives of  the  function  along  the  line
                   <a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1),  that  is  ZX1(J)  is  the  X-partial  derivative  at point (<a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1),Y(J)) for J=1,N. This
                   parameter may be defaulted by setting ISLPSW appropriately.

       ZXM         (real, input) An array containing N X-partial derivatives of  the  function  along  the  line
                   X(M),  that  is  ZXM(J)  is  the  X-partial  derivative  at point (X(M),Y(J)) for J=1,N. This
                   parameter may be defaulted by setting ISLPSW appropriately.

       ZY1         (real, input) An array containing M Y-partial derivatives of  the  function  along  the  line
                   <a href="../man1/Y.1.html">Y</a>(1),  that  is  ZY1(I)  is  the  Y-partial  derivative  at point (X(I),<a href="../man1/Y.1.html">Y</a>(1)) for I=1,M. This
                   parameter may be defaulted by setting ISLPSW appropriately.

       ZYN         (real, input) An array containing M Y-partial derivatives of  the  function  along  the  line
                   Y(N),  that  is  ZY1(I)  is  the  Y-partial  derivative  at point (X(I),Y(N)) for I=1,M. This
                   parameter may be defaulted by setting ISLPSW appropriately.

       ZXY11       (real, input) The X-Y-partial derivative at (<a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1),<a href="../man1/Y.1.html">Y</a>(1). This parameter may  be  defaulted  by
                   setting ISLPSW appropriately.

       ZXYM1       (real,  input)  The  X-Y-partial derivative at (X(M),<a href="../man1/Y.1.html">Y</a>(1). This parameter may be defaulted by
                   setting ISLPSW appropriately.

       ZXY1N       (real, input) The X-Y-partial derivative at (<a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1),Y(N). This parameter may  be  defaulted  by
                   setting ISLPSW appropriately.

       ZXYMN       (real,  input)  The  X-Y-partial derivative at (X(M),Y(N). This parameter may be defaulted by
                   setting ISLPSW appropriately.

       ISLPSW      (integer, input) A switch to indicate which boundary derivatives are user supplied and  which
                   should be estimated internally. Where

                   I1 = 0 if ZX1 is user-supplied and 1 otherwise.
                   I2 = 0 if ZXM is user-supplied and 1 otherwise.
                   I3 = 0 if ZY1 is user-supplied and 1 otherwise.
                   I4 = 0 if ZYN is user-supplied and 1 otherwise.
                   I5 = 0 if ZXY11 is user-supplied and 1 otherwise.
                   I6 = 0 if ZXYM1 is user-supplied and 1 otherwise.
                   I7 = 0 if ZXY1N is user-supplied and 1 otherwise.
                   I8 = 0 if ZXYMN is user-supplied and 1 otherwise.

                   set  ISLPSW  =  I1  + 2*I2 + 4*I3 +8*I4 +16*I5 +32*I6 + 64*I7 + 128*I8. Then, for example, if
                   ISLPSW=0, then all derivative information  is  user-supplied  and  if  ISLPSW=255,  then  all
                   derivative information is to be internally estimated.

       ZP          (real, output) An array of size M x N x 3. On output this contains partial derivatives of the
                   surface at the given nodes. ZP is used by SURF2.

       TEMP        (real, input) Scratch space.

       SIGMA       (real,  input)  Tension factor. Values near zero result in a cubic spline; large values (e.g.
                   50) result in nearly a polygonal line. A typical value is 1.

       IER         (integer, output) An error return value. If IER  is  returned  as  0,  then  no  errors  were
                   detected.

                   = 1 if N is less than 2.
                   = 2 if X or Y values are not strictly increasing.
