</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Sys::Hostname::Long - Try every conceivable way to get full hostname

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Sys::Hostname::Long;
           $host_long = hostname_long;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       How to get the host full name in perl on multiple operating systems (mac, windows, unix* etc)

</pre><h4><b>DISCUSSION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the SECOND release of this code. It has an improved set of tests and improved interfaces - but it
       is still often failing to get a full host name.  This of course is the reason I wrote the module, it is
       difficult to get full host names accurately on each system. On some systems (eg: Linux) it is dependent
       on the order of the entries in /etc/hosts.

       To make it easier to test I have testall.pl to generate an output list of all methods. Thus even if the
       logic is incorrect, it may be possible to get the full name.

       Attempt via many methods to get the systems full name. The Sys::Hostname class is the best and standard
       way to get the system hostname. However it is missing the long hostname.

       Special thanks to <b>David</b> <b>Sundstrom</b> and <b>Greg</b> <b>Bacon</b> for the original Sys::Hostname

       on their success.

       THIS IS IN NEED OF AN UPDATE AFTER NEXT RELEASE.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Unix</b>
       Most  unix  systems  have  trouble  working  out  the  fully qualified domain name as it to be configured
       somewhere in the system correctly. For example in most linux systems (debian, ?) the fully qualified name
       should be the first entry next to the ip number in <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>

       If it is the other way around, it will fail.
