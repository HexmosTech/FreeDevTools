</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       End - generalized END {}.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use End;

           {  my $foo = end {print "Leaving the block\n"};
              ...
              last;    # prints "Leaving the block\n".
              ...
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The module "End" exports a single subroutine "end", which allows you to set up some code that is run
       whenever the current block is exited, regardless whether that is due to a "return", "next", "last",
       "redo", "exit", "die", "goto" or just reaching the end of the block.

       To be more precise, "end" returns an object, that will execute the code when the object is destroyed;
       that is, when the variable assigned to goes out of scope. If the variable is lexical to the current
       block, the code will be executed when leaving the block.

       One can force premature execution of the code by undefining the variable assigned to, or assigning
       another value to the variable.

       "end" only takes one argument, a code reference. If one wishes the code reference to take arguments,
       wrapping the code reference in a closure suffices.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Due to a bug in Perl 5.6.0 (and perhaps before), anonymous subroutines that are not a closure will not go
       out of scope, not even on program termination. That is why "end" wraps the code fragment in a closure.

       There is a second bug in Perl 5.6.0 (and perhaps before) why this is necessary. If the code fragment
       isn't wrapped in another code reference, the original subroutine will be blessed in the package, making
       that "ref" on that code no longer returns the right value.
