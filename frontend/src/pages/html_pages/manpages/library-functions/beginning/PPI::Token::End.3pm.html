</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PPI::Token::End - Completely useless content after the __END__ tag

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
         PPI::Token::End
         isa PPI::Token
                 isa PPI::Element

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If you've read PPI::Token::Whitespace, you should understand by now the concept of documents "floating in
       a sea of PPI::Token::Whitespace".

       Well it doesn't after the __END__ tag.

       Once you __END__, it's all over. Anything after that tag isn't even fit to be called whitespace. It just
       simply doesn't exist as far as perl (the interpreter) is concerned.

       That's not to say there isn't useful content. Most often people use the __END__ tag to hide POD content,
       so that perl never has to see it, and presumably providing some small speed up.

       That's fine. PPI likes POD. Any POD after the __END__ tag is parsed into valid PPI::Token::Pod tags as
       normal. <b>This</b> class, on the other hand, is for "what's after __END__ when it isn't POD".

       Basically, the completely worthless bits of the file :)

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This class has no method beyond what is provided by its PPI::Token and PPI::Element parent classes.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
