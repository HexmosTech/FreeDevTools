</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Minion::Backend::Pg - PostgreSQL backend

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Minion::Backend::Pg;

         my $backend = Minion::Backend::Pg-&gt;new('postgresql://postgres@/test');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Minion::Backend::Pg is a backend for Minion based on Mojo::Pg. All necessary tables will be created
       automatically with a set of migrations named "minion". Note that this backend uses many bleeding edge
       features, so only the latest, stable version of PostgreSQL is fully supported.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       Minion::Backend::Pg inherits all attributes from Minion::Backend and implements the following new ones.

   <b>pg</b>
         my $pg   = $backend-&gt;pg;
         $backend = $backend-&gt;pg(Mojo::Pg-&gt;new);

       Mojo::Pg object used to store all data.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
