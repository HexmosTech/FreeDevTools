</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Hash - Standard hash methods

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Hash (
           new =&gt; 'new',
           scalar =&gt; [ 'foo', 'bar' ],
           array =&gt; 'my_list',
           hash =&gt; 'my_index',
         );
         ...

         my $obj = MyObject-&gt;new( foo =&gt; 'Foozle' );
         print $obj-&gt;foo();

         $obj-&gt;bar('Barbados');
         print $obj-&gt;bar();

         $obj-&gt;my_list(0 =&gt; 'Foozle', 1 =&gt; 'Bang!');
         print $obj-&gt;<a href="../man1/my_list.1.html">my_list</a>(1);

         $obj-&gt;my_index('broccoli' =&gt; 'Blah!', 'foo' =&gt; 'Fiddle');
         print $obj-&gt;my_index('foo');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Standard::Hash suclass of MakeMethods provides a basic constructor and accessors for blessed-hash
       object instances.

   <b>Calling</b> <b>Conventions</b>
       When you "use" this package, the method names you provide as arguments cause subroutines to be generated
       and installed in your module.

       See "Calling Conventions" in Class::MakeMethods::Standard for more information.

   <b>Declaration</b> <b>Syntax</b>
       To declare methods, pass in pairs of a method-type name followed by one or more method names.

       Valid method-type names for this package are listed in "METHOD GENERATOR TYPES".

       See "Declaration Syntax" in Class::MakeMethods::Standard and "Parameter Syntax" in
       Class::MakeMethods::Standard for more information.

</pre><h4><b>METHOD</b> <b>GENERATOR</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b> <b>-</b> <b>Constructor</b>
       For each method name passed, returns a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   Has  a reference to a sample item to copy. This defaults to a reference to an empty hash, but you may
           override this with the "'defaults' =" <u>hash_ref</u>&gt;  method parameter.

       •   If called as a class method, makes a new hash and blesses it into that class.

       •   If called on a hash-based instance, makes a copy of it and blesses the copy into the  same  class  as
           the original instance.

       •   If  passed  a  list  of  key-value  pairs, appends them to the new hash. These arguments override any
           copied values, and later arguments with the same name will override earlier ones.

       •   Returns the new instance.

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Hash (
           new =&gt; 'new',
         );
         ...

         # Bare constructor
         my $empty = MyObject-&gt;new();

         # Constructor with initial values
         my $obj = MyObject-&gt;new( foo =&gt; 'Foozle', bar =&gt; 'Barbados' );

         # Copy with overriding value
         my $copy = $obj-&gt;new( bar =&gt; 'Bob' );

   <b>scalar</b> <b>-</b> <b>Instance</b> <b>Accessor</b>
       For each method name passed, uses a closure to generate a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   Must be called on a hash-based instance.

       •   Has a specific hash key to use to access the related value for each instance.  This defaults  to  the
           method name, but you may override this with the "'hash_key' =" <u>string</u>&gt; method parameter.

       •   If called without any arguments returns the current value.

       •   If called with an argument, stores that as the value, and returns it,

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Hash (
           scalar =&gt; 'foo',
         );
         ...

         # Store value
         $obj-&gt;foo('Foozle');

         # Retrieve value
         print $obj-&gt;foo;

   <b>array</b> <b>-</b> <b>Instance</b> <b>Ref</b> <b>Accessor</b>
       For each method name passed, uses a closure to generate a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   Must be called on a hash-based instance.

       •   Has  a  specific hash key to use to access the related value for each instance.  This defaults to the
           method name, but you may override this with the "'hash_key' =" <u>string</u>&gt; method parameter.

       •   The value for each instance will be a reference to an array (or undef).

       •   If called without any arguments, returns the contents of the array  in  list  context,  or  an  array
           reference in scalar context (or undef).

       •   If  called  with a single array ref argument, sets the contents of the array to match the contents of
           the provided one.

       •   If called with a single numeric argument, uses that  argument  as  an  index  to  retrieve  from  the
           referenced array, and returns that value (or undef).

       •   If  called  with a two arguments, the first undefined and the second an array ref argument, uses that
           array's contents as a list of indexes to return a slice of the referenced array.

       •   If called with a list of argument pairs, each with a numeric index and an  associated  value,  stores
           the  value  at  the  given  index  in  the  referenced  array. If the instance's value was previously
           undefined, a new array is autovivified. The current value in each position will be  overwritten,  and
           later arguments with the same index will override earlier ones. Returns the current array-ref value.

       •   If called with a list of argument pairs, each with the first item being a reference to an array of up
           to two numbers, loops over each pair and uses those numbers to splice the value array.

           The  first  controlling number is the position at which the splice will begin. Zero will start before
           the first item in the list. Negative numbers count backwards from the end of the array.

           The second number is the number of items to be removed from the list. If it is omitted, or undefined,
           or zero, no items are removed. If it is a positive integer, that many items will be returned.

           If both numbers are omitted, or are both undefined, they  default  to  containing  the  entire  value
           array.

           If the second argument is undef, no values will be inserted; if it is a non-reference value, that one
           value will be inserted; if it is an array-ref, its values will be copied.

           The method returns the items that removed from the array, if any.

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Hash (
           array =&gt; 'bar',
         );
         ...

         # Clear and set contents of list
         print $obj-&gt;bar([ 'Spume', 'Frost' ] );

         # Set values by position
         $obj-&gt;bar(0 =&gt; 'Foozle', 1 =&gt; 'Bang!');

         # Positions may be overwritten, and in any order
         $obj-&gt;bar(2 =&gt; 'And Mash', 1 =&gt; 'Blah!');

         # Retrieve value by position
         print $obj-&gt;<a href="../man1/bar.1.html">bar</a>(1);

         # Direct access to referenced array
         print scalar @{ $obj-&gt;bar() };

       There are also calling conventions for slice and splice operations:

         # Retrieve slice of values by position
         print join(', ', $obj-&gt;bar( undef, [0, 2] ) );

         # Insert an item at position in the array
         $obj-&gt;bar([3], 'Potatoes' );

         # Remove 1 item from position 3 in the array
         $obj-&gt;bar([3, 1], undef );

         # Set a new value at position 2, and return the old value
         print $obj-&gt;bar([2, 1], 'Froth' );

   <b>hash</b> <b>-</b> <b>Instance</b> <b>Ref</b> <b>Accessor</b>
       For each method name passed, uses a closure to generate a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   Must be called on a hash-based instance.

       •   Has  a  specific hash key to use to access the related value for each instance.  This defaults to the
           method name, but you may override this with the "'hash_key' =" <u>string</u>&gt; method parameter.

       •   The value for each instance will be a reference to a hash (or undef).

       •   If called without any arguments, returns the contents  of  the  hash  in  list  context,  or  a  hash
           reference in scalar context (or undef).

       •   If  called  with one non-ref argument, uses that argument as an index to retrieve from the referenced
           hash, and returns that value (or undef).

       •   If called with one array-ref argument, uses the contents of that array to retrieve  a  slice  of  the
           referenced hash.

       •   If  called  with  one  hash-ref  argument,  sets  the  contents  of the referenced hash to match that
           provided.

       •   If called with a list of key-value pairs, stores the value under the  given  key  in  the  referenced
           hash. If the instance's value was previously undefined, a new hash is autovivified. The current value
           under each key will be overwritten, and later arguments with the same key will override earlier ones.
           Returns the contents of the hash in list context, or a hash reference in scalar context.

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Hash (
           hash =&gt; 'baz',
         );
         ...

         # Set values by key
         $obj-&gt;baz('foo' =&gt; 'Foozle', 'bar' =&gt; 'Bang!');

         # Values may be overwritten, and in any order
         $obj-&gt;baz('broccoli' =&gt; 'Blah!', 'foo' =&gt; 'Fiddle');

         # Retrieve value by key
         print $obj-&gt;baz('foo');

         # Retrieve slice of values by position
         print join(', ', $obj-&gt;baz( ['foo', 'bar'] ) );

         # Direct access to referenced hash
         print keys %{ $obj-&gt;baz() };

         # Reset the hash contents to empty
         %{ $obj-&gt;baz() } = ();

   <b>object</b> <b>-</b> <b>Instance</b> <b>Ref</b> <b>Accessor</b>
       For each method name passed, uses a closure to generate a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   Must be called on a hash-based instance.

       •   Has  a  specific hash key to use to access the related value for each instance.  This defaults to the
           method name, but you may override this with the "'hash_key' =" <u>string</u>&gt; method parameter.

       •   The value for each instance will be a reference to an object (or undef).

       •   If called without any arguments returns the current value.

       •   If called with an argument, stores that as the value, and returns it,
