</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements an ordered hash, meaning that it associates keys with values like a Perl hash, but
       keeps the keys in a consistent order.  Because it is implemented as an object and manipulated with method
       calls, it is much slower than a Perl hash.  This is the cost of keeping order.

       However, compared to other <b>ordered</b> hash implementations, Hash::Ordered is optimized for getting and
       setting individual elements and is generally faster at most other tasks as well.  For specific details,
       see Hash::Ordered::Benchmarks.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           $oh = Hash::Ordered-&gt;new;
           $oh = Hash::Ordered-&gt;new( @pairs );

       Constructs an object, with an optional list of key-value pairs.

       The position of a key corresponds to the first occurrence in the list, but the value will be updated if
       the key is seen more than once.

       Current API available since 0.009.

   <b>clone</b>
           $oh2 = $oh-&gt;clone;
           $oh2 = $oh-&gt;clone( @keys );

       Creates a shallow copy of an ordered hash object.  If no arguments are given, it produces an exact copy.
       If a list of keys is given, the new object includes only those keys in the given order.  Keys that aren't
       in the original will have the value "undef".

   <b>keys</b>
           @keys = $oh-&gt;keys;
           $size = $oh-&gt;keys;

       In list context, returns the ordered list of keys.  In scalar context, returns the number of elements.

       Current API available since 0.005.

   <b>values</b>
           @values = $oh-&gt;values;
           @values = $oh-&gt;values( @keys );

       Returns an ordered list of values.  If no arguments are given, returns the ordered values of the entire
       hash.  If a list of keys is given, returns values in order corresponding to those keys.  If a key does
       not exist, "undef" will be returned for that value.

       In scalar context, returns the number of elements.

       Current API available since 0.006.

   <b>get</b>
           $value = $oh-&gt;get("some key");

       Returns the value associated with the key, or "undef" if it does not exist in the hash.

   <b>set</b>
           $oh-&gt;set("some key" =&gt; "some value");

       Associates a value with a key and returns the value.  If the key does not already exist in the hash, it
       will be added at the end.

   <b>exists</b>
           if ( $oh-&gt;exists("some key") ) { ... }

       Test if some key exists in the hash (without creating it).

   <b>delete</b>
           $value = $oh-&gt;delete("some key");

       Removes a key-value pair from the hash and returns the value.

   <b>clear</b>
           $oh-&gt;clear;

       Removes all key-value pairs from the hash.  Returns undef in scalar context or an empty list in list
       context.

       Current API available since 0.003.

   <b>push</b>
           $oh-&gt;push( one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2);

       Add a list of key-value pairs to the end of the ordered hash.  If a key already exists in the hash, it
       will be deleted and re-inserted at the end with the new value.

       Returns the number of keys after the push is complete.

   <b>pop</b>
           ($key, $value) = $oh-&gt;pop;
           $value = $oh-&gt;pop;

       Removes and returns the last key-value pair in the ordered hash.  In scalar context, only the value is
       returned.  If the hash is empty, the returned key and value will be "undef".

   <b>unshift</b>
           $oh-&gt;unshift( one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2 );

       Adds a list of key-value pairs to the beginning of the ordered hash.  If a key already exists, it will be
       deleted and re-inserted at the beginning with the new value.

       Returns the number of keys after the unshift is complete.

   <b>shift</b>
           ($key, $value) = $oh-&gt;shift;
           $value = $oh-&gt;shift;

       Removes and returns the first key-value pair in the ordered hash.  In scalar context, only the value is
       returned.  If the hash is empty, the returned key and value will be "undef".

   <b>merge</b>
           $oh-&gt;merge( one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2 );

       Merges a list of key-value pairs into the ordered hash.  If a key already exists, its value is replaced.
       Otherwise, the key-value pair is added at the end of the hash.

   <b>as_list</b>
           @pairs = $oh-&gt;as_list;
           @pairs = $oh-&gt;as_list( @keys );

       Returns an ordered list of key-value pairs. If no arguments are given, all pairs in the hash are
       returned.  If a list of keys is given, the returned list includes only those key-value pairs in the given
       order.  Keys that aren't in the original will have the value "undef".

   <b>iterator</b>
           $iter = $oh-&gt;iterator;
           $iter = $oh-&gt;iterator( reverse $oh-&gt;keys ); # reverse

           while ( my ($key,$value) = $iter-&gt;() ) { ... }

       Returns a code reference that returns a single key-value pair (in order) on each invocation, or the empty
       list if all keys are visited.

       If no arguments are given, the iterator walks the entire hash in order.  If a list of keys is provided,
       the iterator walks the hash in that order. Unknown keys will return "undef".

       The list of keys to return is set when the iterator is generator.  Keys added later will not be returned.
       Subsequently deleted keys will return "undef" for the value.

   <b>preinc</b>
           $oh-&gt;preinc($key);      # like ++$hash{$key}

       This method is sugar for incrementing a key without having to call "set" and "get" explicitly. It returns
       the new value.

       Current API available since 0.005.

   <b>postinc</b>
           $oh-&gt;postinc($key);     # like $hash{$key}++

       This method is sugar for incrementing a key without having to call "set" and "get" explicitly.  It
       returns the old value.

       Current API available since 0.005.

   <b>predec</b>
           $oh-&gt;predec($key);      # like --$hash{$key}

       This method is sugar for decrementing a key without having to call "set" and "get" explicitly. It returns
       the new value.

       Current API available since 0.005.

   <b>postdec</b>
           $oh-&gt;postdec($key);      # like $hash{$key}--

       This method is sugar for decrementing a key without having to call "set" and "get" explicitly.  It
       returns the old value.

       Current API available since 0.005.

   <b>add</b>
           $oh-&gt;add($key, $n);     # like $hash{$key} += $n

       This method is sugar for adding a value to a key without having to call "set" and "get" explicitly. With
       no value to add, it is treated as "0".  It returns the new value.

       Current API available since 0.005.

   <b>subtract</b>
           $oh-&gt;subtract($key, $n);  # like $hash{$key} -= $n

       This method is sugar for subtracting a value from a key without having to call "set" and "get"
       explicitly. With no value to subtract, it is treated as "0".  It returns the new value.

       Current API available since 0.005.

   <b>concat</b>
           $oh-&gt;concat($key, $str); # like $hash{$key} .= $str

       This method is sugar for concatenating a string onto the value of a key without having to call "set" and
       "get" explicitly. It returns the new value.  If the value to append is not defined, no concatenation is
       done and no warning is given.

       Current API available since 0.005.

   <b>or_equals</b>
           $oh-&gt;or_equals($key, $str); # like $hash{$key} ||= $str

       This method is sugar for assigning to a key if the existing value is false without having to call "set"
       and "get" explicitly. It returns the new value.

       Current API available since 0.005.

   <b>dor_equals</b>
           $oh-&gt;dor_equals($key, $str); # like $hash{$key} //= $str

       This method is sugar for assigning to a key if the existing value is not defined without having to call
       "set" and "get" explicitly. It returns the new value.

       Current API available since 0.005.

</pre><h4><b>OVERLOADING</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Boolean</b>
           if ( $oh ) { ... }

       When used in boolean context, a Hash::Ordered object is true if it has any entries and false otherwise.

   <b>String</b>
           say "$oh";

       When used in string context, a Hash::Ordered object stringifies like typical Perl objects. E.g.
       "Hash::Ordered=<a href="../man0x7f815302cac0/ARRAY.0x7f815302cac0.html">ARRAY</a>(0x7f815302cac0)"

       Current API available since 0.005.

   <b>Numeric</b>
           $count = 0 + $oh;

       When used in numeric context, a Hash::Ordered object numifies as the decimal representation of its memory
       address, just like typical Perl objects. E.g.  140268162536552

       For the number of keys, call the "keys" method in scalar context.

       Current API available since 0.005.

   <b>Fallback</b>
       Other overload methods are derived from these three, if possible.

</pre><h4><b>TIED</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       Using "tie" is slower than using method calls directly.  But for compatibility with libraries that can
       only take hashes, it's available if you really need it:

           tie my %hash, "Hash::Ordered", @pairs;

       If you want to access the underlying object for method calls, use "tied":

           tied( %hash )-&gt;unshift( @data );

       Tied hash API available since 0.005.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Deletion</b> <b>and</b> <b>order</b> <b>modification</b> <b>with</b> <b>push,</b> <b>pop,</b> <b>etc.</b>
       This can be expensive, as the ordered list of keys has to be updated.  For small hashes with no more than
       25 keys, keys are found and spliced out with linear search.  As an optimization for larger hashes, the
       first change to the ordered list of keys will construct an index to the list of keys.  Thereafter,
       removed keys will be marked with a "tombstone" record.  Tombstones will be garbage collected whenever the
       number of tombstones exceeds the number of valid keys.

       These internal implementation details largely shouldn't concern you.  The important things to note are:

       •   The costs of efficient deletion are deferred until you need it

       •   Deleting lots of keys will temporarily appear to leak memory until garbage collection occurs

</pre><h4><b>MOTIVATION</b></h4><pre>
       For a long time, I used Tie::IxHash for ordered hashes, but I grew frustrated with things it lacked, like
       a  cheap  way  to copy an IxHash object or a convenient iterator when not using the tied interface.  As I
       looked at its implementation, it seemed more complex than I though it needed,  with  an  extra  level  of
       indirection that slows data access.

       Given  that  frustration,  I  started  experimenting  with the simplest thing I thought could work for an
       ordered hash: a hash of key-value pairs and an array with key order.

       As I worked on this, I also started searching for other modules doing similar things.  What I found  fell
       broadly into two camps: modules based on tie (even if they offered an OO interface), and pure OO modules.
       They all either lacked features I deemed necessary or else seemed overly-complex in either implementation
       or API.

       Hash::Ordered  attempts to find the sweet spot with simple implementation, reasonably good efficiency for
       most common operations, and a rich, intuitive API.

       After discussions with Mario Roy about the potential use of Hash::Ordered with MCE, I optimized  deletion
       of larger hashes and provided a tied interface for compatibility.  Mario's suggestions and feedback about
       optimization were quite valuable.  Thank you, Mario!

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  describes  other  ordered-hash  modules  I  found  on CPAN.  For benchmarking results, see
       Hash::Ordered::Benchmarks.

   <b>Tie</b> <b>modules</b>
       The following modules offer some sort of tie interface.  I don't like ties, in general,  because  of  the
       extra  indirection  involved  over  a  direct  method call. Still, you can make any tied interface into a
       faster OO one with "tied":

           tied( %tied_hash )-&gt;FETCH($key);

       Tie::Hash::Indexed is implemented in XS and thus seems promising  if  pure-Perl  isn't  a  criterion;  it
       generally  fails tests on Perl 5.18 and above due to the hash randomization change.  Despite being XS, it
       is slower than Hash::Ordered at everything exception creation and deletion.

       Tie::IxHash is probably the most well known and includes an OO API.  Given the  performance  problems  it
       has, "well known" is the only real reason to use it.

       These  other  modules below have very specific designs/limitations and I didn't find any of them suitable
       for general purpose use:

       •   Tie::Array::AsHash — array elements split with separator; tie API only

       •   Tie::Hash::Array — ordered alphabetically; tie API only

       •   Tie::InsertOrderHash — ordered by insertion; tie API only

       •   Tie::LLHash — linked-list implementation; quite slow

       •   Tie::StoredOrderHash — ordered by last update; tie API only

   <b>Other</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>hash</b> <b>modules</b>
       Other modules stick with an object-oriented API, with a wide variety of implementation approaches.

       Array::AsHash is essentially an inverse implementation from Hash::Ordered.  It keeps pairs  in  an  array
       and  uses  a  hash  to  index  into  the array.  This indirection would already make hash-like operations
       slower, but the specific implementation makes it even worse, with abstractions and  function  calls  that
       make getting or setting individual items up to 10x slower than Hash::Ordered.

       However,  "Array::AsHash"  takes an arrayref to initialize, which is very fast and can return the list of
       pairs faster, too.  If you mostly create and list out very large ordered hashes  and  very  rarely  touch
       individual entries, I think this could be something to very cautiously consider.

       These other modules below have restrictions or particularly complicated implementations (often relying on
       "tie") and thus I didn't think any of them really suitable for use:

       •   Array::Assign — arrays with named access; restricted keys

       •   Array::OrdHash — overloads array/hash deref and uses internal tied data

       •   Data::Pairs — array of key-value hashrefs; allows duplicate keys

       •   Data::OMap — array of key-value hashrefs; no duplicate keys

       •   Data::XHash — blessed, tied hashref with doubly-linked-list
