</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::MakeMethods::Evaled::Hash - Typical hash methods

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Evaled::Hash (
           new =&gt; 'new',
           scalar =&gt; [ 'foo', 'bar' ],
           array =&gt; 'my_list',
           hash =&gt; 'my_index',
         );
         ...

         # Constructor
         my $obj = MyObject-&gt;new( foo =&gt; 'Foozle' );

         # Scalar Accessor
         print $obj-&gt;foo();

         $obj-&gt;bar('Barbados');
         print $obj-&gt;bar();

         # Array accessor
         $obj-&gt;my_list(0 =&gt; 'Foozle', 1 =&gt; 'Bang!');
         print $obj-&gt;<a href="../man1/my_list.1.html">my_list</a>(1);

         # Hash accessor
         $obj-&gt;my_index('broccoli' =&gt; 'Blah!', 'foo' =&gt; 'Fiddle');
         print $obj-&gt;my_index('foo');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Evaled::Hash subclass of MakeMethods provides a simple constructor and accessors for blessed-hash
       object instances.

   <b>Calling</b> <b>Conventions</b>
       When you "use" this package, the method names you provide as arguments cause subroutines to be generated
       and installed in your module.

       See "Calling Conventions" in Class::MakeMethods::Standard for a summary, or "USAGE" in Class::MakeMethods
       for full details.

   <b>Declaration</b> <b>Syntax</b>
       To declare methods, pass in pairs of a method-type name followed by one or more method names. Valid
       method-type names for this package are listed in "METHOD GENERATOR TYPES".

       See "Declaration Syntax" in Class::MakeMethods::Standard for more syntax information.

</pre><h4><b>METHOD</b> <b>GENERATOR</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b> <b>-</b> <b>Constructor</b>
       For each method name passed, returns a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   If called as a class method, makes a new hash and blesses it into that class.

       •   If  called  on  a hash-based instance, makes a copy of it and blesses the copy into the same class as
           the original instance.

       •   If passed a list of key-value pairs, appends them to the  new  hash.  These  arguments  override  any
           copied values, and later arguments with the same name will override earlier ones.

       •   Returns the new instance.

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Evaled::Hash (
           new =&gt; 'new',
         );
         ...

         # Bare constructor
         my $empty = MyObject-&gt;new();

         # Constructor with initial values
         my $obj = MyObject-&gt;new( foo =&gt; 'Foozle', bar =&gt; 'Barbados' );

         # Copy with overriding value
         my $copy = $obj-&gt;new( bar =&gt; 'Bob' );

   <b>scalar</b> <b>-</b> <b>Instance</b> <b>Accessor</b>
       For each method name passed, uses a closure to generate a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   Must be called on a hash-based instance.

       •   Uses the method name as a hash key to access the related value for each instance.

       •   If called without any arguments returns the current value.

       •   If called with an argument, stores that as the value, and returns it,

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Evaled::Hash (
           scalar =&gt; 'foo',
         );
         ...

         # Store value
         $obj-&gt;foo('Foozle');

         # Retrieve value
         print $obj-&gt;foo;

   <b>array</b> <b>-</b> <b>Instance</b> <b>Ref</b> <b>Accessor</b>
       For each method name passed, uses a closure to generate a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   Must be called on a hash-based instance.

       •   Uses the method name as a hash key to access the related value for each instance.

       •   The value for each instance will be a reference to an array (or undef).

       •   If called without any arguments, returns the current array-ref value (or undef).

       •   If  called  with  one argument, uses that argument as an index to retrieve from the referenced array,
           and returns that value (or undef).

       •   If called with a list of index-value pairs, stores the value at the given  index  in  the  referenced
           array.  If  the  instance's  value was previously undefined, a new array is autovivified. The current
           value in each position will be overwritten, and later arguments with the  same  index  will  override
           earlier ones. Returns the current array-ref value.

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Evaled::Hash (
           array =&gt; 'bar',
         );
         ...

         # Set values by position
         $obj-&gt;bar(0 =&gt; 'Foozle', 1 =&gt; 'Bang!');

         # Positions may be overwritten, and in any order
         $obj-&gt;bar(2 =&gt; 'And Mash', 1 =&gt; 'Blah!');

         # Retrieve value by position
         print $obj-&gt;<a href="../man1/bar.1.html">bar</a>(1);

         # Direct access to referenced array
         print scalar @{ $obj-&gt;bar() };

         # Reset the array contents to empty
         @{ $obj-&gt;bar() } = ();

   <b>hash</b> <b>-</b> <b>Instance</b> <b>Ref</b> <b>Accessor</b>
       For each method name passed, uses a closure to generate a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   Must be called on a hash-based instance.

       •   Uses the method name as a hash key to access the related value for each instance.

       •   The value for each instance will be a reference to a hash (or undef).

       •   If called without any arguments, returns the current hash-ref value (or undef).

       •   If called with one argument, uses that argument as an index to retrieve from the referenced hash, and
           returns that value (or undef).

       •   If  called  with  a  list  of key-value pairs, stores the value under the given key in the referenced
           hash. If the instance's value was previously undefined, a new hash is autovivified. The current value
           under each key will be overwritten, and later arguments with the same key will override earlier ones.
           Returns the current hash-ref value.

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Evaled::Hash (
           hash =&gt; 'baz',
         );
         ...

         # Set values by key
         $obj-&gt;baz('foo' =&gt; 'Foozle', 'bar' =&gt; 'Bang!');

         # Values may be overwritten, and in any order
         $obj-&gt;baz('broccoli' =&gt; 'Blah!', 'foo' =&gt; 'Fiddle');

         # Retrieve value by key
         print $obj-&gt;baz('foo');

         # Direct access to referenced hash
         print keys %{ $obj-&gt;baz() };

         # Reset the hash contents to empty
         @{ $obj-&gt;baz() } = ();
