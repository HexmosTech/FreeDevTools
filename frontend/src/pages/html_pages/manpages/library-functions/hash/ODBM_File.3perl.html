       ODBM_File - Tied access to odbm files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Fcntl;   # For O_RDWR, O_CREAT, etc.
        use ODBM_File;

         # Now read and change the hash
         $h{newkey} = newvalue;
         print $h{oldkey};
         ...

         untie %h;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "ODBM_File" establishes a connection between a Perl hash variable and a file in ODBM_File format;.  You
       can manipulate the data in the file just as if it were in a Perl hash, but when your program exits, the
       data will remain in the file, to be used the next time your program runs.

       Use "ODBM_File" with the Perl built-in "tie" function to establish the connection between the variable
       and the file.  The arguments to "tie" should be:

       1.  The hash variable you want to tie.

       2.  The  string  "ODBM_File".  (Ths tells Perl to use the "ODBM_File" package to perform the functions of
           the hash.)

       3.  The name of the file you want to tie to the hash.

       4.  Flags.  Use one of:

           "O_RDONLY"
             Read-only access to the data in the file.

           "O_WRONLY"
             Write-only access to the data in the file.

           "O_RDWR"
             Both read and write access.

           If you want to create the file if it does not exist, add  "O_CREAT"  to  any  of  these,  as  in  the
           example.  If you omit "O_CREAT" and the file does not already exist, the "tie" call will fail.

       5.  The  default permissions to use if a new file is created.  The actual permissions will be modified by
           the user's umask, so you should probably use 0666 here. (See "umask" in perlfunc.)

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       On failure, the "tie" call returns an undefined value and probably sets $! to contain the reason the file
       could not be tied.

   <b>"odbm</b> <b>store</b> <b>returned</b> <b>-1,</b> <b>errno</b> <b>22,</b> <b>key</b> <b>"..."</b> <b>at</b> <b>..."</b>
       This warning is emitted when you try to store a key or a value that is  too  long.   It  means  that  the
       change was not recorded in the database.  See BUGS AND WARNINGS below.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PORTABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> <b>ODBM</b> <b>files</b> <b>from</b> <b>untrusted</b> <b>sources.</b>

       On modern Linux systems these are typically GDBM files, which are not portable across platforms.

       The GDBM documentation doesn't imply that files from untrusted sources can be safely used with "libgdbm".

       Systems  that  don't use GDBM compatibilty for old dbm support will be using a platform specific library,
       possibly inherited from BSD systems, where it may or may not be safe to use an untrusted file.

       A maliciously crafted file might cause perl to crash or even expose a security vulnerability.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       There are a number of limits on the size of the data that you can store  in  the  ODBM  file.   The  most
       important  is  that  the  length  of  a key, plus the length of its associated value, may not exceed 1008
       bytes.

       See "tie" in perlfunc, perldbmfilter, Fcntl
