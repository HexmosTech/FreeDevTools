       Tie::Hash::NamedCapture - Named regexp capture buffers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           tie my %hash, "Tie::Hash::NamedCapture";
           # %hash now behaves like %+

           tie my %hash, "Tie::Hash::NamedCapture", all =&gt; 1;
           # %hash now access buffers from regexp in $qr like %-

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is used to implement the special hashes "%+" and "%-", but it can be used to tie other
       variables as you choose.

       When the "all" parameter is provided, then the tied hash elements will be array refs listing the contents
       of each capture buffer whose name is the same as the associated hash key. If none of these buffers were
       involved in the match, the contents of that array ref will be as many "undef" values as there are capture
       buffers with that name. In other words, the tied hash will behave as "%-".

       When the "all" parameter is omitted or false, then the tied hash elements will be the contents of the
       leftmost defined buffer with the name of the associated hash key. In other words, the tied hash will
       behave as "%+".

       The keys of "%-"-like hashes correspond to all buffer names found in the regular expression; the keys of
       "%+"-like hashes list only the names of buffers that have captured (and that are thus associated to
       defined values).

       This implementation has been moved into the core executable, but you can still load this module for
       backward compatibility.
