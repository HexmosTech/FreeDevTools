</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::Role::HashDumper - Dump selected hash keys as a string

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 4.13 of Dist::Zilla::Role::HashDumper, released December 17, 2017 as part
       of Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM version 6.000.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Plugins implementing HashDumper may call their own "extract_keys" method to extract selected keys from a
       hash and return a string suitable for injecting into Perl code.  They may also call the "hash_as_string"
       method to do the same for an entire hash.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>extract_keys</b>
         my $string = $plugin-&gt;extract_keys($name, \%hash, @keys);
         eval "%new_hash = ($string);";

       This combines "extract_keys_as_hash" and "hash_as_string".  It constructs a string of properly quoted
       keys and values from selected keys in a hash.  (Note that "\%hash" is a reference, but @keys is not.)
       The $name is used only in a log_debug message.

       If any key has no value (or its value is an empty hash or array ref) it will be omitted from the list.
       If all keys are omitted, the empty string is returned.  Otherwise, the result always ends with a comma.

   <b>extract_keys_as_hash</b>
         my $hashref = $plugin-&gt;extract_keys_as_hash($name, \%hash, @keys);

       This constructs a hashref from from selected keys in a hash.  (Note that "\%hash" is a reference, but
       @keys is not.)  The $name is used only in a log_debug message.

       If any key has no value (or its value is an empty hash or array ref) it will be omitted from the new
       hashref.  If all keys are omitted, an empty hashref is returned.

   <b>hash_as_string</b>
         my $string = $plugin-&gt;hash_as_string(\%hash);
         eval "%new_hash = ($string);";

       This constructs a string of properly quoted keys and values from a hash.  If the hash is empty, the empty
       string will be returned.  Otherwise, the result always ends with a comma.
