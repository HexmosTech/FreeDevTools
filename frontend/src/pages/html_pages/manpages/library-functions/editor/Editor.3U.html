</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Editor - base class for top-level windows in an application

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;Unidraw/editor.h&gt;</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An  editor  provides  a  complete  user interface for editing a component subject.  It unites one or more
       viewers with commands and tools that act upon the component and its subcomponents.  Editor is an abstract
       class derived from MonoScene; the Editor class adds the protocol for  associating  tools,  commands,  and
       viewers  with  the  component(s)  they  affect.   A  programmer normally derives one or more application-
       specific editors from the  Editor  base  class  and  defines  their  appearance  with  a  composition  of
       interactors.   Each window of a Unidraw application is usually an instance of an editor subclass designed
       for the editing domain, and it is these windows that the user recognizes as the application program.

</pre><h4><b>PUBLIC</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>virtual</b> <b>~Editor()</b>
              Editors should not be deleted explicitly if the Unidraw object is used to  open  and  close  them.
              Moreover,  Editor  subclasses  should  not explicitly delete the component they edit.  The Unidraw
              object will delete the editor's component after the editor is closed,  provided  no  other  editor
              references the component (or its relatives) and the component is not known to the catalog.

       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>Open()</b>
       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>Close()</b>
              Open  informs  the  editor  that it has just become visible and accessible to the user, in case it
              needs to know, and Close signals the editor that it is no longer needed  and  should  perform  any
              final housekeeping operations.  For example, the editor may display a copyright message when it is
              first  opened,  or  it  make  take the opportunity when closed to warn the user to save a modified
              component. These operations simply notify the editor of a condition and are not usually called  by
              the  application;  instead,  the  application  makes editors appear and disappear with the Unidraw
              object, which calls these operations as appropriate.

       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>Handle(Event&amp;)</b>
              Editor redefines Handle to  interpret  key  events  as  keyboard  equivalents  via  the  HandleKey
              operation  (described  below).   This  is  appropriate  in  the  common  case where the interactor
              composition that defines the editor's appearance does not interpret keyboard events.

       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>Update()</b>
              By default, the editor's Update operation calls Update on its viewer(s).

       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>SetComponent(Component*)</b>
       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>SetViewer(Viewer*,</b> <b>int</b> <b>=</b> <b>0)</b>
       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>SetSelection(Selection*)</b>
       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>SetKeyMap(Viewer*,</b> <b>int</b> <b>=</b> <b>0)</b>
       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>SetCurTool(Tool*)</b>

       <b>virtual</b> <b>Component*</b> <b>GetComponent()</b>
       <b>virtual</b> <b>Viewer*</b> <b>GetViewer(int</b> <b>=</b> <b>0)</b>
       <b>virtual</b> <b>KeyMap*</b> <b>GetKeyMap()</b>
       <b>virtual</b> <b>Selection*</b> <b>GetSelection()</b>
       <b>virtual</b> <b>Tool*</b> <b>GetCurTool()</b>
              Assign and return various objects managed by  the  editor.   These  operations  are  undefined  by
              default.

              The  component  is  the  object  that  the user edits through the editor.  The editor can have any
              number of viewers, identified serially.  An editor can maintain a key map  for  defining  keyboard
              equivalents   and  a  selection  object  for  keeping  track  of  selected  components  (typically
              subcomponents of the component being edited).  The editor also has a notion of the  tool  that  is
              currently  engaged,  that  is,  the  tool that would be used if the user clicked in a viewer.  The
              SetCurTool and GetCurTool operations assign and return this tool, respectively.

       <b>virtual</b> <b>StateVar*</b> <b>GetState(const</b> <b>char*)</b>
              The editor may maintain a string-to-state variable mapping to provide external access to any state
              variables it defines.  The GetState operation  returns  a  state  variable  given  an  identifying
              string.   Defining  such  a  mapping lets components query the editor for state variables that may
              affect them without extending the editor protocol, potentially allowing interchange of  components
              from different applications.  This operation returns nil by default.

       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>InsertDialog(Interactor*)</b>
       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>RemoveDialog(Interactor*)</b>
              Insert or remove an interactor that provides a modal interface, such as a dialog box.  By default,
              these operations insert the dialog into the world as a transient window centered atop the editor's
              canvas.   Subclasses  can  redefine  them to insert and remove an interactor (suitably embellished
              with a border, drop shadow, etc.) as needed.  Subclasses should not assume that  two  InsertDialog
              operations  will  always be separated by a RemoveDialog operation; that is, multiple dialogs might
              be visible at once.

</pre><h4><b>PROTECTED</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Editor()</b>
              You cannot create instances of the Editor class; rather, you  define  subclasses  that  suit  your
              application.  The constructor is thus protected to disallow instantiation.

       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>HandleKey(Event&amp;)</b>
              Executes  a  command  given a valid keyboard event as defined by the key-to-command mapping in the
              KeyMap object.

       <b>virtual</b> <b>boolean</b> <b>DependsOn(Component*)</b>
              Return whether the editor depends on the given component in any  way.   Unidraw  may  destroy  the
              component if no editor depends on it.

       <b>void</b> <b>SetWindow(ManagedWindow*)</b>
       <b>ManagedWindow*</b> <b>GetWindow()</b>
              Get and set the window associated with the editor.
