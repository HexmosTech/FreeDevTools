</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::Documentation::RequireLinkedURLs - use L&lt;&gt; markup on URLs in POD

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This policy is part of the "Perl::Critic::Pulp" add-on.  It asks you to put "L&lt;&gt;" markup on URLs in POD
       text in Perl 5.8 and higher.

           use 5.008;

           =head1 HOME PAGE

           <a href="http://foo.org/mystuff/index.html">http://foo.org/mystuff/index.html</a>      # bad

           L&lt;<a href="http://foo.org/mystuff/index.html">http://foo.org/mystuff/index.html</a>&gt;   # good

       "L&lt;&gt;" markup gives clickable links in "pod2html" and similar formatters, and even in the plain text
       formatters may give "&lt;http://...&gt;" style angles around the URL which is a semi-conventional way to
       delimit from surrounding text and in particular from an immediately following comma or period.

       This is only cosmetic and on that basis this policy is low severity and under the "cosmetic" theme (see
       "POLICY THEMES" in Perl::Critic).

       Only plain text parts of the POD are considered.  Verbatim paragraphs cannot have "L&lt;&gt;" markup (and it's
       usually a mistake to put it there, as per "ProhibitVerbatimMarkup").

           This is verbatim text,

               <a href="http://somewhere.com">http://somewhere.com</a>      # ok in verbatim

   <b>Perl</b> <b>5.8</b>
       "L&lt;http://...&gt;" linking of URLs is new in the Perl 5.8 POD specification.  It comes out badly from the
       formatters in earlier Perl where the "/" is taken to be a section delimiter.  For that reason this policy
       only applies if there's an explicit "use 5.008" or higher in the code.

           use 5.005;

           =item C&lt;<a href="http://foo.org">http://foo.org</a>&gt;       # ok when don't have Perl 5.8 L&lt;&gt;

   <b>Bad</b> <b>URLs</b>
       Some obvious intentional dummy URLs like "L&lt;<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>&gt;" are ignored.  They're examples and won't
       go anywhere as a clickable link.  You might like to put "C&lt;&gt;" on them for a typeface, but that is not
       required by this policy.  Currently ignored URL variations are like

           <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>
           <a href="http://foo.com">http://foo.com</a>
           https://foo.org
           <a href="ftp://bar.org.au">ftp://bar.org.au</a>
           <a href="http://quux.com.au">http://quux.com.au</a>
           <a href="http://xyzzy.co.uk">http://xyzzy.co.uk</a>
           <a href="http://foo.co.nz">http://foo.co.nz</a>
           <a href="http://host">http://host</a>:port
           http://...

       A URL is anything starting "http://", "https://", "ftp://", "news://" or "nntp://".

   <b>Begin</b> <b>Blocks</b>
       Text in any "=begin :foo" block is checked since ":" means POD markup and it's likely URLs can be
       helpfully linked there, even if it's only for some particular formatter.

       Other "=begin" blocks are ignored since "L&lt;&gt;" there will not normally be possible or desirable.

   <b>Disabling</b>
       If you don't care about this, if for instance it's hard enough to get your programmers to write
       documentation at all without worrying about markup, then disable "RequireLinkedURLs" from your
       <u><a href="file:~/.perlcriticrc">~/.perlcriticrc</a></u> file in the usual way (see "CONFIGURATION" in Perl::Critic),
