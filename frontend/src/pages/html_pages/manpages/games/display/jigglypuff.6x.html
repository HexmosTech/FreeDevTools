</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       jigglypuff - save your screen by tormenting your eyes.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jigglypuff</b>  [--display  <u>host:display.screen</u>]  [--visual  <u>visual</u>] [--window] [--root] [--window-id <u>number</u>]
       [-delay <u>number</u>] [-cycles <u>number</u>] [-wireframe] [-fps] [-color <u>colorspec</u>] [-spooky] [-complexity <u>n</u>] [-speed
       <u>n</u>] [-spherism <u>n</u>] [-hold <u>n</u>] [-distance <u>n</u>] [-damping <u>n</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This draws all manners of obscene, spastic, puffy, vaguely ball-shaped objects orbiting lazily about  the
       screen, with a dizzying array of mostly pointless options.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--visual</b> <u>visual</u>
               Specify  which  visual  to  use.   Legal  values are the name of a visual class, or the id number
               (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.

       <b>--window</b>
               Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       <b>--root</b>  Draw on the root window.

       <b>--window-id</b> <u>number</u>
               Draw on the specified window.

       <b>--delay</b> <u>number</u>
               Per-frame delay, in microseconds.  Default: 20000 (0.02 seconds.).

       <b>--wireframe</b>
               Render in wireframe instead of solid. Default: render solid.

       <b>--fps</b>   Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

       <b>-tetra</b> <b>|</b> <b>-no-tetra</b>
               Whether to start the shape in the form of a tetrahedron. The default is to start as a sphere.

       <b>-color</b> <u>colorspec</u>
               Available options for colorspec are: cycle, flowerbox, clownpuke,  chrome  and  #xxxxxx  (i.e  an
               (old-style) X color specification.) Default: cycle

       <b>-spooky</b> <u>n</u>
               This  option  controls a kind of interesting effect obtained by using unnormalized normal vectors
               (how's that for an oxymoron?) in OpenGL.  A value of zero disables the effect. Other values  vary
               the lengths of the normals proportionally.  Okay, so it's not very spooky. Sue me.  Default: 0

       <b>-complexity</b> <u>n</u>
               Valid  options  are  1,  2,  and  3. Everything else is treated as though it were 2, which is the
               default. This controls the number of polygons in the 'thing'. A value of 1 yields 1024,  and  the
               values go up in powers of 4. (i.e. 4096, 16384.)
                note:  There  is an inherent lack of stability at lower complexity, which can cause the shape to
               devolve into a 'flying snotrag'.

       <b>-speed</b> <u>n</u>
               Controls how fast the blob moves around the screen. Default: 500.

       <b>-spherism,</b> <b>-hold,</b> <b>-distance,</b> <b>-damping</b>
               These options control the 'jigglyness'.  The  best  way  to  explain  these  is  to  explain  how
               jigglypuff  works. Basically, the shape is a tetrahedron whose faces are subdivided into a number
               of triangles, forming a mesh.  Each of the vertices of the mesh has two different forces  applied
               to it: one proportional to its distance from the surface of a sphere, and one proportional to the
               difference  of  the  distance  to each of its neighbors in the mesh to a given ideal distance. In
               short, one tries to move the points into the configuration of a sphere, and the  other  tries  to
               push  them  back  into  a  tetrahedron. The catch is that the points have inertia, so they always
               overshoot their target, and hence they oscillate. The magnitudes of the two forces is  controlled
               by the options 'spherism' and ´hold'; 'distance' specifies the distance the vertices seek to keep
               from  their  neighbors, with 500 corresponding to the size of the start tetrahedron.  e.g. if you
               were to give the options '-tetra -spherism 0 -distance 500', you  would  end  up  with  a  stable
               tetrahedron.  The 'damping' option can help to keep the blob from collapsing or flying apart. The
               option specifies the speed at which  damping  starts,  hence  lower  values  mean  more  damping.
               Defaults: spherism: 75; hold: 800; distance: 100; damping: 500.

       <b>-random</b> Probably  the  only parameter you'l ever need. Overrides almost all of the parameters with random
               values. The values affected  are:  speed,  spherism,  hold,  distance,  damping,  spooky,  color,
               wireframe and tetra.  Default: off

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> to get the default host and display number.

       <b>XENVIRONMENT</b>
               to  get  the  name  of  a  resource  file  that  overrides  the  global  resources  stored in the
               RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

       <b>XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW</b>
               The window ID to use with <u>--root</u>.
