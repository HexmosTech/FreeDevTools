       xye - puzzle game

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Xye  is a puzzle game in which the objective is to help a character that looks like a green circle to get
       all the gems in the room. This is, of course, not as easy as it sounds,  Xye  must  solve  all  sorts  of
       puzzles while at the same time avoiding all sorts of traps and beasts.

       Xye  is  similar  to  other  puzzle  games  like sokoban or boulderdash, yet it also includes some arcade
       elements.

       Xye is a derivative of a classic windows game called Kye, which is the base of  the  gameplay  experience
       and  visual elements. Xye is able to play level files that were made for Kye and Sokoban. It is also able
       to play custom .xye files, a richer level format that allows the new objects and features, you  can  make
       these levels by hand or by using the built-in editor that comes with the game.

       Thanks to the SDL library, Xye is cross platform software, and there are versions available for Linux and
       windows,  there  are also ports for FreeBSD and it should be possible to compile it in other platforms as
       well.
