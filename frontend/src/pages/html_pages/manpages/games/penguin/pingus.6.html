</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pingus - A puzzle game where you have to save penguins

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pingus</b> [OPTION]... [FILE]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pingus  is  a  side-scrolling  puzzle game where the player has to guide a group of penguins from the en‐
       trance of a level to the exit, in between the path is blocked by numerous obstacles and dangers that  the
       player has to overcome by assigning actions to the penguins.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       -h, --help
              Displays this help

       -V, --version
              Print version number and exit

       -v, --verbose
              Enable info level log output

       -D, --debug
              Enable debug level log output

       -Q, --quiet
              Disable all log output

   <b>DISPLAY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       -w, --window
              Start in Window Mode

       -f, --fullscreen
              Start in Fullscreen

       -r, --renderer=RENDERER
              Use the given renderer, defaults to sdl. Available renderers are:

              sdl    A simple software renderer based on SDL, this is the default and the safest options.

              opengl The  OpenGL  renderer  will  use  hardware  acceleration to render the graphics, it is much
                     faster then the SDL renderer and recommended when the hardware supports OpenGL.

              delta  The delta renderer uses SDL for rendering and doesn't use hardware  acceleration,  it  will
                     however  try  to  increase  rendering performance by only re rendering screen elements that
                     have changed. Using the delta renderer will disable some effects such  as  scrolling  back‐
                     ground to allow maximum benefits.

       -g, --geometry=WIDTHxHEIGHT
              Set  the window resolution for pingus (default: 800x600). Note that <b>--geometry</b> only applies to the
              window resolution, for the fullscreen resolution use <b>--fullscreen-resolution</b>

       -R, --fullscreen-resolution=WIDTHxHEIGHT
              Set the resolution used in fullscreen mode (default: 800x600)

       --software-cursor
              Enable software cursor

   <b>GAME</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       --no-auto-scrolling
              Disable automatic scrolling. Automatic scrolling will cause the  screen  to  scroll  whenever  the
              mouse reaches the border of the screen. Automatic scrolling will only be active in fullscreen mode
              or when mouse-grab is enabled.

       --drag-drop-scrolling
              Enable  drag'n drop scrolling. By default Pingus will use a rubber-band scrolling where the scroll
              speed depends on how far away the cursor is from the position  when  the  mouse  button  has  been
              clicked. In drag&amp;drop mode scrolling will behave more like in traditional GUI applications such as
              Gimp,  where  clicking  the scroll button will 'pick up' the playfield and allow to move it around
              till it is released again.

   <b>SOUND</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       -s, --disable-sound
              Disable sound

       -m, --disable-music
              Disable music

   <b>LANGUAGE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       -l, --language=LANG
              Select language to use with Pingus

       --list-languages
              List all available languages

   <b>EDITOR</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       -e, --editor
              Loads the level editor

   <b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       -d, --datadir=DIR
              Load game datafiles from DIR

       -u, --userdir=DIR
              Load config files and store savegames in DIR

       -a, --addon=DIR
              Load game modifications from DIR. Files in DIR will be used instead of the files in found  in  the
              main  datadir  of Pingus, thus allowing to modifications, such as sprites replacements, additional
              levels, etc. to the game, without changing the main data files.

       --no-cfg-file
              Don't read <a href="file:~/.pingus/config">~/.pingus/config</a>

       -c, --config=FILE
              Read config from FILE

       --controller=FILE
              Uses the controller given in FILE

   <b>DEBUG</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       --developer-mode
              Enables some special features for developers

       -t, --speed=SPEED
              Set the game speed (0=fastest, &gt;0=slower)

       -k, --fps=FPS
              Set the desired game framerate (frames per second)

       --tile-size=INT
              Set the size of the map tiles (default: 32)

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Basher The  Basher  will  to  a horizontal dig, leaving behind it a tunnel. It is not able to dig through
              metal.

       Blocker
              The Blocker will stop and stay in position, directing other penguins  to  turn  around  when  they
              reach him.

       Bomber The Bomber will blow up on the spot and take a bit of surrounding ground with it.

       Bridger
              The Bridger will build a small bridge, useful for crossing small chasm.

       Climber
              The  Climber  actions  allows  a Pingu to travel upwards a vertical wall. Unlike other actions the
              climber action is a permanent addition to the Pingus ability.

       Digger The Digger will dig a hole into the ground. It can't dig through metal.

       Floater
              The Floater action will give a penguin a small propeller that lets  him  gently  glide  down  from
              great heights that would otherwise be deadly.

       Jumper The  Jumper will let the Pingu do a big leap forward, allowing him to cross chasm and small verti‐
              cal obstacles.

       Miner  The Miner will dig a diagonal hole into the ground.

       Slider The Slider will make a tiny leap forward, gliding on its belly for a  short  while,  allowing  the
              Pingu to make it through narrow tunnels.

</pre><h4><b>LEVEL</b> <b>EDITOR</b></h4><pre>
       Pingus  comes  with  a  build in level editor. The level editor can currently be used to edit level files
       (*.pingus) as well as prefabricated objects (*.prefabs). Worldmaps  (*.worldmap)  can  currently  not  be
       edited with the editor.

       All Pingus data files, except the sound and images, are raw text files and can be edited in a text editor
       if the editor isn't sufficient.

       If you want to submit a level to be included in the next release follow the following naming convention:

       <u>{theme}{number}-{nickname}.pingus</u>

       Do  not  use space or uppercase in the levelname and keep the levelname simple (i.e. <u>snow1-grumbel.pingus</u>
       not <u>pingus-go-on-a-long-journey-in-snowland-grumbel.pingus</u>).  The filename should not reflect the  actual
       level title, it simply should be unique and not conflict with other peoples levels. If you plan on build‐
       ing a whole levelset, name the levels after the levelset.

       To submit a level send it to &lt;<a href="mailto:pingus-devel@nongnu.org">pingus-devel@nongnu.org</a>&gt;.

   <b>PREFABS</b>
       A prefab, short for prefabricated object, is a group of objects that have been combined into a new single
       object.  A  classic  case of a prefab would for example be a snowman, it is build out of multiple smaller
       snowball objects and then saved as prefab to allow easy reuse in multiple levels.  Unlike  simple  object
       groups,  prefab  are  saved as reference in the level, thus if the prefab is updated, all levels will see
       the change. Like object groups prefabs can be ungrouped to break them back down to individual objects  if
       individual  editing  is  needed,  they are seizing to be prefabs at that point and changes to the .prefab
       file will no longer be reflected in the level.

       Prefabs behave pretty much like regular levels, to create a prefab simply start a new  level  and  insert
       the objects as usual, unlike regular levels the level size is ignored and thus you have to place your ob‐
       ject  around the center of the levels, marked by a cross, to have the prefab function properly. To save a
       prefab as prefab instead of level you have to append .prefab suffix to the filename.

       Thumbnail generation for prefabs is currently done offline with  the  script  <u>./tools/generate-prefab-im‐</u>
       <u>ages.sh</u> available from the Pingus source tree.

   <b>UI</b> <b>QUIRCKS</b>
       The  Pingus  level  editor is best used with a combination of mouse and keyboard, all essential functions
       have keyboard shortcuts.

       Unlike more traditional GUIs, the Pingus editor lacks scrollbars, so to move around the level or the  ob‐
       ject list on the right simply use the middle or right mouse button and drag&amp;drop the list around.

       Objects from the object list can be inserted into the level by drag&amp;dropping them over to the level.

   <b>KEYBOARD</b> <b>SHORTCUTS</b>
       <b>Delete</b>, <b>Backspace</b>
              Delete all currently selected objects

       <b>A</b>      Select or unselect all objects

       <b>D</b>      Duplicate the currently selected objects

       <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>L</b>
              Move the current selection by one pixel, if <b>Shift</b> is held, move it by 32 pixel.

       <b>PageUp</b>, <b>PageDown</b>
              Raise or lower an object

       ShiftPageUp, ShiftPageDown
              Raise or lower an object to the top or bottom

       <b>R</b>, ShiftR
              Rotate an objects 90 degrees, if <b>Shift</b> is held rotate it the other way around

       <b>F</b>, ShiftV
              Flip an object horizontally

       <b>V</b>, ShiftF
              Flip an object vertically

       <b>B</b>, ShiftB
              Toggle the background color to make it easier to see small pixel errors. If shift is hold the col‐
              or will be toggled in the opposite direction.

       <b>+</b>, <b>=</b>, <b>-</b>
              Increase/decrease  the  repeat value of selected objects, this will only have an effect on objects
              having an repeat value (switchdoors, liquids, ...).
