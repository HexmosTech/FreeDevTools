</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       snipe2d — Orbital Eunuchs Sniper is an overhead shooting game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>snipe2d</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>snipe2d</b> game.

       This  manual  page  was  written for the <b>Debian</b> distribution because the original program does not have a
       manual page.

       Orbital Eunuchs Sniper is an overhead shooting game. You (the Eunuch on the orbital laser  platform)  are
       tasked  with  protecting  the VIPs (blue) from the terrorists (red)!  You view a city from overhead, from
       the point of a view of an orbiting satellite.  Your laser takes some time to recharge.
