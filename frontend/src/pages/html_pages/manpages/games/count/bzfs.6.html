</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Bzfs</b> is the server for <b>BZFlag</b>, and it must be running to play.  It can  be  run  on  any  system  on  the
       network  (including  a  player's  system or one without graphics).  Terminating the server terminates the
       game in progress.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b> <u>linear</u> <u>angular</u>
                      Sets the maximum linear and angular accelerations.  The units are  somewhat  arbitrary  so
                      you'll  have to experiment to find suitable values. Positive values will set limits to the
                      acceleration and lower they are, greater is the inertia.  Zero or negative values  disable
                      acceleration limits.

       <b>-adminlagannounce</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
                      Announce players that lag more than <u>milliseconds</u> to admins.

       <b>-admsg</b> <u>message</u> Define a message which will be broadcast to all players every 15 minutes.  This option can
                      be used multiple times to define a multiline message.

       <b>-advertise</b> <u>groupname,groupname,...</u>
                      Allows  control  of  who  can see this server on the server list.  Use: <b>-advertise</b> <b>NONE</b> to
                      make a private server (no one will see the server, but global logins  can  be  used).  The
                      default,  if  -advertise  is  not  specified,  is  to  allow  everyone  to see the server.
                      Otherwise, your server will only be listed to members of the groups which you specify, eg:
                      <b>-advertise</b> <b>JOE,BOB</b>.

       <b>-autoTeam</b>      Automatically assign players to teams when they connect so that there are an equal  number
                      of  players  on  all  available  teams.   Players are placed on teams that have the fewest
                      players; otherwise they will be placed on the weakest team.  Weakest team is the team with
                      the lowest combined kill ratio.

       <b>-b</b>             When <b>-c</b> is supplied, this option randomly rotates the buildings.

       <b>-badwords</b> <u>badwordfile</u>
                      Specify a file that contains bad words that will be used when either  <b>-filterCallsigns</b>  or
                      <b>-filterChat</b> is enabled.

       <b>-ban</b> <u>ip</u>[,<u>ip</u>]...
                      Prohibits connections from the listed IP addresses. Trailing 255 bytes are treated as mask
                      bytes.

       <b>-banfile</b> <u>filename</u>
                      Specifies  the  name of a file where bzfs will store the banlist. It will load the banlist
                      from this file when it starts (if the file exists), and write the banlist back to the file
                      when someone gets banned or unbanned.  If this option isn't given the banlist will not  be
                      saved.

       <b>-c</b>             Enables the capture-the-flag style game. By default this allocates one team flag per team.
                      This can be modified see +f team. By default, the free-for-all style is used.

       <b>-cache</b> <u>worldCacheURL</u>
                      Specifies  the  URL  for  the  world  cache  file. This is a binary file that clients will
                      attempt to download before getting the world from the bzfs server.

       <b>-cacheout</b> <u>filename</u>
                      Save the currently specified world into a binary cache file and exit.

       <b>-conf</b> <u>configfilename</u>
                      Specifies the name of a configuration file to be used to set  all  of  the  bzfs  options,
                      rather than setting them on the command line.

       <b>-cr</b>            Enables  the  capture-the-flag  style  game with random map.  You can optionally specify a
                      building density by providing a number  (default  is  5).   One  team  flag  per  team  is
                      provided, but more can be added thru +f team.  By default, the free-for-all style is used.

       <b>-d</b>             Increase debugging level. If more -d is given, more debugging info is obtained.

       <b>-density</b> <u>num</u>   Specify  density for buildings, i.e. the higher the integer number, the more buildings you
                      will get. This applies to automatically generated maps only.

       <b>-disableBots</b>   Disallow clients from using the ROGER autopilot or from using robots.

       <b>+f</b> {<u>good</u> | <u>bad</u> | <u>teamflag-id</u>}[<u>{count}</u>]
                      Forces the existence of the given flag.  If specified multiple times for the same <u>flag-id</u>,
                      then that many flags will appear.  The <u>good</u> argument is equivalent to specifying  <b>+f</b>  once
                      for each kind of good flag. Same goes for the <u>bad</u> argument.  The <u>team</u> argument adds a team
                      flag  to each team, assuming that the game style is capture the flag. The optional <u>{count}</u>
                      parameter allows the specification of multiple flags of the same type. Note that the curly
                      braces are required.

       <b>-f</b> {<u>good</u> | <u>bad</u> | <u>flag-id</u>}
                      Disallows random flags of the given type.  Required flags given by the <b>+f</b> option are still
                      provided.  The <u>bad</u> argument is equivalent to specifying <b>-f</b> once for each kind of bad flag.
                      Same goes for <b>good</b>, but you probably do not want to do that.
                      An example of running a server with 40 to 50 flags except genocide would be "+s 40  -s  50
                      -f  G".  Similarly, "+f good{40} +f bad{10} -f G{40}" would give you exactly 40 good flags
                      except genocide and 10 of each bad flag.

       <b>-fb</b>            Allow flags on box buildings.

       <b>-filterCallsigns</b>
                      Turn on the filtering of callsigns and mottos.  Callsigns and mottos are compared  against
                      bad words provided via <b>-badwords</b>.

       <b>-filterChat</b>    Turn  on  the  filtering  of  chat  messages.   Messages  that  contain words listed via a
                      <b>-badwords</b> file are replaced with !@#$%^&amp;* characters.

       <b>-filterSimple</b>  By default, all filtering is aggressive, matching much more than what is  strictly  listed
                      in a <b>-badwords</b> file for convenience.  Providing this option will make the <b>-filterCallsigns</b>
                      and <b>-filterChat</b> comparisons exact match only.

       <b>-g</b>             Quit after serving one game.

       <b>-gndtex</b> <u>texture-name</u>
                      Specify the name of the ground texture.

       <b>-groupdb</b> <u>file</u>  Load groups from file

       <b>-h</b>             Buildings are given random heights.

       <b>-handicap</b>      Players  are  given  a  handicap advantage based on their ability in relation to the other
                      players. Handicapped players will have faster tanks and shots. The handicap is  determined
                      by the player's score in relation to other players.

       <b>-help</b>          Shows a help page and lists all the valid flag id's.

       <b>-helpmsg</b> <u>file</u> <u>name</u>
                      Provide a message accessible by /help <u>name</u>, which sends no more than the first 50 lines of
                      <u>file</u> to the player.

       <b>-i</b> <u>interface</u>   Server  will  listen  for  and  respond  to  ``pings''  (sent  via broadcast) on the given
                      interface.  Clients use this to find active servers on the network. This is the TCP/UDP/IP
                      address the server will listen on.

       <b>-j</b>             Allows jumping.

       <b>-jitterdrop</b> <u>warn-count</u>
                      Kicks players after <u>warn-count</u> jitter warnings.

       <b>-jitterwarn</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
                      Send warnings to players that jitter more than <u>milliseconds</u>.

       <b>-lagannounce</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
                      Announce players that lag more than <u>milliseconds</u> in public.

       <b>-lagdrop</b> <u>warn-count</u>
                      Kicks players after <u>warn-count</u> lag warnings.

       <b>-lagwarn</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
                      Send warnings to players that lag more than <u>milliseconds</u>.

       <b>-loadplugin</b> <u>name</u>[<u>,options</u>]
                      Load the specified plugin. <u>name</u> can either be the name of the plugin, or  a  path  to  its
                      library file. Optionally, you can provide any options the plugin requires.

       <b>-masterBanURL</b> <u>URL</u>
                      Specify  alternate  URLs  for the master ban file to be pulled from.  This argument may be
                      provided multiple times.

       <b>-maxidle</b> <u>seconds</u>
                      Kick players that did not play longer than <u>seconds</u>. Pausing players are not kicked.  If  a
                      player uttered a word recently, he will be kicked after thrice the given time.

       <b>-mp</b> {<u>count</u> | [<u>rogue</u>]<b>,</b>[<u>red</u>]<b>,</b>[<u>green</u>]<b>,</b>[<u>blue</u>]<b>,</b>[<u>purple</u>]<b>,</b>[<u>observer</u>]}
                      Sets  the  maximum  number  of  players, total or per team.  A single value sets the total
                      number of players allowed.  Five comma separated values set the maximum for each team.  If
                      a count is left blank then no limit is set for that team, except  for  the  limit  on  the
                      total number of players.  Both forms may be provided.  For rabbit chase, the "rogue" value
                      sets the total number of non-observer player, and all other values must be zero.

       <b>-mps</b> <u>max-score</u> Sets  a  maximum  score  for  individual players.  The first player to reach this score is
                      declared the winner and the game is over.

       <b>-ms</b> <u>shots</u>      Allows up to <u>shots</u> simultaneous shots for each player.  This is 1 by default.

       <b>-mts</b> <u>max-score</u> Sets a maximum score for teams.  The first team to reach this score is declared the winner
                      and the game is over.

       <b>-noMasterBanlist</b>
                      Server will not attempt to load the master ban list from the internet.

       <b>-noradar</b>       Disable the use of the radar.

       <b>-noTeamKills</b>   Players on the same team are immune to each other's shots. Rogue is excepted.

       <b>-offa</b>          Enables the Open-Free-for-All style game. This is a teamless mode, similar to the  classic
                      deathmatch in other games.

       <b>-p</b> <u>port</u>        Listen  for  game connections on <u>port</u> instead of the default port.  Use <b>-help</b> to print the
                      default port, or use <b>-d</b> debug printing.

       <b>-packetlossdrop</b> <u>warn-count</u>
                      Kicks players after <u>warn-count</u> packetloss warnings.

       <b>-packetlosswarn</b> <u>percent</u>
                      Send warnings to players that have more more than <u>percent</u> loss.

       <b>-passwd</b> <u>password</u>
                      Specify a server administrator password for use in remote administration  such  as  /kick,
                      /ban, /mute, etc.  messages.

       <b>-pidfile</b> <u>filename</u>
                      Specify  a  file  where  the server will write its process ID so it may be used for remote
                      administration.

       <b>-poll</b> <u>variable=value</u>
                      Configure several aspects of the in-game polling system

                      <b>banTime</b>
                             default number of minutes player should be banned  (unspecified,  the   default  is
                             300)

                      <b>vetoTime</b>
                             max seconds authorized user has to abort poll (default is 20)

                      <b>votePercentage</b>
                             percentage of players required to affirm a poll (unspecified, the default is 50.1%)

                      <b>voteRepeatTime</b>
                             minimum seconds required before a player may request another vote (default is 300)

                      <b>votesRequired</b>
                             minimum number of additional votes required to make a vote valid (default is 2)

                      <b>voteTime</b>
                             maximum amount of time player has to vote, in seconds (default is 60)

       <b>-printscore</b>    Write score to stdout whenever it changes

       <b>-publictitle</b> <u>description</u>
                      Advertise  this  server  on the internet with the given <u>description</u>.  By default, a server
                      will respond to broadcast queries,  allowing  clients  to  find  servers  running  on  the
                      standard  port on the local subnet.  The <b>-publictitle</b> option causes the server to register
                      itself with a list server, which clients can query to get a list of <b>bzfs</b> servers.

       <b>-publicaddr</b> <u>address</u>[:<u>port</u>]
                      Advertise this server with the given <u>address</u>  and  <u>port</u>.   Normally  a  server  advertises
                      itself  at  the local address and port.  Some servers are not accessible from the internet
                      at this address (for example servers behind a firewall using Network Address Translation).
                      Use this option to specify the address and/or port  that  internet  users  should  use  to
                      access this server.

       <b>-publiclist</b> <u>url</u>
                      Advertise  this  server  on  the list servers listed at <u>url</u>.  Only has an effect when used
                      with <b>-publictitle</b> and/or <b>-publicaddr</b>.  A built-in url is  used  by  default.   The  <b>BZFlag</b>
                      clients  use  the  same  built-in  url  so,  by  default,  clients will see public servers
                      automatically.  This argument may be provided multiple times  to  publicize  a  server  to
                      multiple list servers.

       <b>-publickey</b> <u>key</u> Advertise  this  server on the list server(s) using the specified key.  Only has an effect
                      when used with <b>-publictitle</b> and/or <b>-publicaddr</b>.

       <b>-q</b>             If specified, the server will not listen for nor respond to ``pings''.  <b>BZFlag</b>  sends  out
                      these  pings  to  give  the  user a list of available servers.  This effectively makes the
                      server private, especially if the <b>-p</b> option is also used.

       <b>+r</b>             Makes most shots ricochet.  Super bullets, shock waves, and guided missiles do not.

       <b>-rabbit</b> [<u>score</u> | <u>killer</u> | <u>random</u>]
                      Enables the rabbit-chase style game.  By default, the free-for-all  style  is  used.   You
                      must  specify  the  algorithm  used to pick a new rabbit when the old one dies.  The <u>score</u>
                      algorithm uses a modified wins/(wins+losses) score and picks the top scoring player to  be
                      the  new  rabbit.   The <u>killer</u> algorithm specifies a reverse tag game where whomever kills
                      the rabbit becomes the new rabbit.  The <u>random</u>  algorithm  randomly  picks  a  new  rabbit
                      without regard to score.  (The <u>score</u> algorithm is the original behavior.)

       <b>-recbuf</b> <u>size</u>   Start with the recording buffer active, with the specified size (in megabytes).

       <b>-recbufonly</b>    Disable recording straight to files

       <b>-recdir</b> <u>directory</u>
                      Specify the directory for record and replay files.

       <b>-replay</b>        Start the server in replay mode.

       <b>-reportfile</b> <u>filename</u>
                      Write  messages  to  the  server  admin written using the <b>/report</b> command to this file. If
                      neither <b>-reportfile</b> or <b>-reportpipe</b> is used the <b>/report</b> command will be disabled.

       <b>-reportpipe</b> <u>command</u>
                      Pipe messages to the server admin written using the <b>/report</b> command  to  this  program  or
                      shell command. See <b>-reportfile</b>.

       <b>+s</b> <u>num-flags</u>   The server will have an extra <u>num-flags</u> random super flags available at all times.  The <b>-f</b>
                      option  can  be used to restrict which types of flags will be added.  Required flags given
                      by the <b>+f</b> option are not included in the <u>num-flags</u> total.

       <b>-s</b> <u>num-flags</u>   The server will have up to <u>num-flags</u> random super flags available at  any  time.   The  <b>-f</b>
                      option  can  be used to restrict which types of flags will be added.  Required flags given
                      by the <b>+f</b> option are not included in the <u>num-flags</u> total.

       <b>-sa</b>            Antidote flags are provided for players with bad flags.

       <b>-sb</b>            Allow spawns on box buildings.

       <b>-set</b> <u>name</u> <u>value</u>
                      Set BZDB variable <u>name</u> to <u>value</u>.

       <b>-setforced</b> <u>name</u> <u>value</u>
                      Set BZDB variable <u>name</u> to <u>value</u>, even if the variable does not exist.

       <b>-sl</b> <u>id</u> <u>num</u>     Restrict flag <u>id</u> to <u>num</u> shots.

       <b>-spamtime</b> <u>time</u> Minimum time between player chat messages that are alike.

       <b>-spamwarn</b> <u>warnLimit</u>
                      Number of warnings a player/spammer gets, who  violates -spamtime.

       <b>-speedtol</b> <u>factor</u>
                      Override the default speed auto kick factor. The factor should not be less then  1.0.  The
                      factor is a multiplier.

       <b>-srvmsg</b> <u>message</u>
                      Define  a  server  welcome  message.  This  option  can be used multiple times to define a
                      multiline message.

       <b>-st</b> <u>time</u>       Bad flags are automatically dropped after <u>time</u> seconds.

       <b>-sw</b> <u>count</u>      Bad flags are automatically dropped after <u>count</u> wins.  Capturing  a  team  flag  does  not
                      count as a win.

       <b>-synclocation</b>  Forces all clients to use the same location (longitude and latitude).

       <b>-synctime</b>      Forces  all  clients  to  use the same time of day.  The current time is determined by the
                      server's clock.  This disables the + and - keys on the clients.

       <b>-t</b>             Adds teleporters to the game.

       <b>-tftimeout</b> <u>time-limit</u>
                      If the last player in a team leaves while someone else is carrying the team flag, the team
                      flag will not reset until it is captured, or until the player drops  it  and  it  is  left
                      alone  for  some time. This option specifies the number of seconds that the flag should be
                      left alone before it is reset. The default value is 30.

       <b>-time</b> {<u>time-limit</u> | <u>ending-time</u>}
                      Sets a time limit on the game to <u>time-limit</u> or  <u>ending-time</u>.  The  game  will  be  stopped
                      <u>time-limit</u> seconds after the first player connects, or at <u>ending-time</u>, whichever is given.
                      The  <u>ending-time</u>  should  be given in hh:mm:ss format, but does not need minute and second
                      arguments. If only hour is given, it must end in ':'. Each unspecified argument is set  to
                      0.

       <b>-timemanual</b>    When  using <b>-time</b>, the countdown will start when the first player joins. With <b>-timemanual</b>,
                      the countdown has to be started manually using the <u>/countdown</u> command. This is useful  for
                      matches.

       <b>-tk</b>            Changes  the  default  behavior  where a player dies when he kills a teammate.  When using
                      this option, he will just get a -1 score penalty for the kill but not be killed in game.

       <b>-tkannounce</b>    Announce teamkills to the admin channel.

       <b>-tkkr</b> <u>percent</u>  Kicks players whose team killing to normal kill ratio is greater than <u>percent</u>  [1-100].  A
                      start up grace period is given to players.

       <b>-ts</b> [<u>micros</u>]   Include  timestamp  information  in  DEBUG  output  —  useful  for  logging.  If <u>micros</u> is
                      specified, microseconds will be added to the timestamp.

       <b>-UPnP</b>          If enabled during build, bzfs try to communicate with the Gateway to set  Port  Forwarding
                      and to supply information not specified with -i (local interface) and -publicaddr

       <b>-userdb</b> <u>file</u>   Load group associations from file

       <b>-vars</b> <u>file</u>     Loads  values  for  game configurable variables from <u>file</u>. Entries are one per line in the
                      form: <b>set</b> <b>variable</b> <b>value</b>. For a list of variables that are  configurable,  in  the  BZFlag
                      client, send a message with <u>/set</u> as the text.

       <b>-version</b>       Prints the version number of the executable.

       <b>-world</b> <u>world-file</u>
                      Reads a specific BZFlag <b>.bzw</b> world layout file for the game map.

       <b>-worldsize</b> <u>world-size</u>
                      Changes the size for random maps

   <b>Notes</b>
       The  server uses nearly zero CPU time when nobody is playing, and even during a game the server uses very
       little CPU, so it's not a burden on the system to leave one running and it won't interfere with a  player
       using  the  same  system  (except  on  Windows  95, which <u>really</u> sucks at multitasking).  The server will
       continue to run until terminated.  If a game is in progress when the server goes down, all  players  will
       be  kicked  off  and the game will be aborted without warning.  The server resets itself when all players
       have quit.  All players must quit to reset the server when a game is over (because of  a  score  or  time
       limit).

       The following game styles are recommended starting points.

              <b>-c</b> [<b>-b</b>]        Basic capture-the-flag game.  It teaches teamwork and dogfighting skills.

              <b>-s</b> <b>-t</b>          Free-for-all   with  superflags  and  teleporters.   Teaches  players  how  to  use
                             superflags and teleporters for maximum effect.  You may want to  allow  players  to
                             drop bad flags with any of -sa, -st, and -sw.

       Notice  that  the  maximum  number  of shots for these styles is one.  Having low shot counts can greatly
       increase general playability and learning speed.  However, this is not always true of every game style or
       game world, and a skilled player will learn to deal with a variety of shot  counts.   Single  shot  games
       have additional disadvantage in WAN games where lag/jitter can cause unfair advantage.  Single shot, non-
       Jump  games  will  teach  valuable lessons in dodging, however, and are excellent starting points for the
       beginner.

   <b>Networking</b>
       Communication between the server and clients (i.e. between <b>bzfs</b> and <b>bzflag</b>) during a game is via TCP  and
       UDP.   Use  the  <b>-help</b> option to get the server's default port.  If there's a firewall between the server
       and client, the firewall must accept connections from the client to this port and  forward  them  to  the
       server.

       Clients can search for servers by sending broadcast UDP packets.  But they must be on the same local area
       network  for  this to work.  Clients can also find servers advertised using <u>-publictitle</u> by querying list
       servers.

       Game information is relayed through the server. Some communication between clients, such as position  and
       orientation information, is normally sent via UDP packets.  Other data, like flag grab and kill messages,
       are  sent  to  the  server  via  TCP.  The  server then turns around and broadcasts these packets  to all
       players. Since being in a game implies connection to the server, all players are guaranteed  to  get  all
       messages  sent via TCP.  But the UDP packets may be discarded.  If other players can see your tank in the
       game but it never appears to move and shots go through it, chances are high that your UDP  connection  is
       not working.

   <b>Worlds</b>
       BZFlag  worlds  come in two varieties, randomly generated ones, and human designed ones. By default, bzfs
       uses randomly generated world unless you specify the -world command line or  configuration  file  option.
       The world file specified by the -world option is a text based file that contains a list of world objects.
       This  file  can  be created using programs found on github, or can be hand edited.  See the <a href="../man5/bzw.5.html">bzw</a>(5) manual
       page for more details.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>SERVER</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/clientquery</b> [<u>callsign</u>]
              Retrieve client version info from all users, or just CALLSIGN if given. Example:
              /clientquery MrApathyCream
              MrApathyCream: Version: BZFlag 1.11.6-20040729-gnu-linux-SDL

       <b>/date,</b> <b>/time</b>
              Responds with the current server local time. /date and /time are exactly the same. Example:
              Tuesday September 08 06:45:54 2004

       <b>/flaghistory</b>
              Lists what flags players have grabbed in the past. Example:
              MrApathyCream: (&lt;-) (-&gt;) (O) (CB) (M) (B) (JM) (WA)
              Gerbol: (L) (GM) (L) (GM) (CL) (ST) (GM) (L)
              captain_macgyver: (SB) (SW)

       <b>/idlestats</b>
              Displays the idle time in seconds for each player. A player is idle when
              he is dead and has not respawned yet. Example:
              MrApathyCream: 0s
              Gerbol: 80s
              captain_macgyver: 13s

       <b>/lagstats</b>
              Lists network delays, jitter and number of lost resp. out of order packets by player. Example:
              MrApathyCream 335 +- 10ms
              Gerbol 210 +- 3ms
              captain_macgyver 155 +- 0ms  12% lost/ooo

       <b>/me</b> <u>action</u>

              This command displays an "action" that is conveyed to another player.  It allows
              for a little more expressivity in the game.  For example: "/me is hunting wabbits"
              turns into a message like "TimRiker is hunting wabbits" that gets displayed
              differently to other players.

       <b>/msg</b> <u>"callsign"</u> <u>message</u>

              This command allows a player to send a message to another player.  Similar to using
              the "," and "." message keys in the game and then selecting your recipient, this
              will send some message to particular player.  The quotes are optional.

       <b>/part</b> [<u>message</u>]
              Leave the server with a goodbye message (similar to IRC's /part)
              /part Gotta go! bye everyone!

       <b>/password</b> <u>password</u>
              Attempt to gain administrator status Example:
              /password supersecretpassword
              You are now an administrator!

       <b>/poll</b> {{<u>ban</u> | <u>kick</u>} <u>callsign</u> | vote {<u>yes</u> | <u>no</u>} | veto}
              Interact and make requests of the bzflag voting system via the /poll command.
              The ban and kick subcommands request a vote to respectively ban or kick some
              player.  The playername is expected as the next argument.  The vote and veto
              commands behave identical to the /vote and /veto command counterparts,
              expecting the same arguments in following.  By default, you must be registered
              to request or vote on a poll, and an admin to veto.

       <b>/quit</b> [<u>message</u>]
              Quit the game with a goodbye message (similar to IRC's /quit)
              /quit Gotta go! bye everyone!

       <b>/report</b> <u>message</u>
              Write a message to the server administrator. Example:
              /report I like this map!

       <b>/uptime</b>
              Prints server's current running time in days, hours, mins and secs.

       <b>/vote</b> {<u>yes</u> | <u>no</u>}
              If there is a poll active, this command will place a vote in favor or in
              opposition to the poll.  Multiple languages are supported as a vote argument
              in addition to "yes" and "no".  By default, you must be registered to vote on
              a poll.

                  reason: Cheaters
              47.23.17.* banned by Tankslave

       <b>/checkip</b> <u>ip</u>
              Check whether the IP is banned and print the corresponding rule. This does not
              cover hostbans. Example:
              /checkip 35.23.43.66
              35.23.43.66 is banned:
              35.23.43.66 banned by Tankmaster
                  reason: Cheaters

       <b>/countdown</b> [<u>seconds</u>]
              Starts the countdown sequence for a timed game.  The countdown
              sequence length can optionally be specified in seconds.  Examples:

              /countdown 3

       <b>/flag</b> <b>reset</b> {<u>all</u>|<u>unused</u>|<u>team</u>|<u>FlagId</u>}
              Repositions flags. If <u>unused</u> is specified, flags carried
              by tanks are not affected. Using the <u>team</u> option only
              resets team flags, whereas specifying a flag id (such as GM) only
              repositions flags of this type. If <u>noteam</u> is specified,
              team flags will not be reset. Examples:
              /flag reset unused noteam
              /flag reset G

       <b>/flag</b> <b>show</b>
              Shows all flags with information. Example:

       <b>/kick</b> {<u>"Player</u> <u>Name"</u> | <u>playerName</u> | <u>#slot</u>} <u>reason</u>
              Kick a player off the server. Example:
              /kick Gerbol
              You were kicked off the server by MrApathyCream

              /kick #1 Team killing
              Kick the player using slot 1 because Team Killing

              Note: Slots numbers are only displayed in admins clients.

              Change the number of lag warnings given before a player is kicked. Example:
              /lagdrop 3

       <b>/modcount</b> [<u>seconds</u>]
              Change the time on the clock by the specified number of seconds. Example:
              /modcount +320

       <b>/mute</b> {<u>#slot</u> | <u>callsign</u>}
              Allows a server admin to remove the ability for a player to communicate with
              other players. Once muted the player may only talk to admins on the server.
              This command removes the TALK permission that is enabled by default for all
              players. (disabling TALK by default would let you run a "silent" server)

       <b>/packetlosswarn</b> [<u>time</u>]
              Change the maximum allowed packetloss. Example:
              /packetloss 1

       <b>/packetlossdrop</b> [<u>count</u>]
              Change the number of packetloss warnings given before a player is kicked. Example:
              /packetloss 3

       <b>/playerlist</b>
              List player names and IP addresses. Example:
              /playerlist

       <b>/record</b> <b>file</b> <u>filename</u>
              Start recording directly to a file

       <b>/record</b> <b>list</b>
              List all files in the recordings directory

       <b>/record</b> <b>rate</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Set the time between game state updates stored in the recording. This will affect
              the granularity of the 'skips' you can do while replaying a file. It will also
              make the recording files bigger if it is set to a faster update rate.

       <b>/record</b> <b>save</b> <u>filename</u> [<u>seconds</u>]
              Save the recording buffer into a file. If seconds is specified, then only save
              that many previous seconds into the file.

       <b>/record</b> <b>size</b> <u>megabytes</u>
              Set the size of the recording memory buffer

       <b>/record</b> <b>start</b>
              Start recording into the memory buffer

       <b>/record</b> <b>stats</b>
              Display the statistics for the current recording (file or buffered)

       <b>/record</b> <b>stop</b>
              Stop recording into the memory buffer

       <b>/replay</b> <b>list</b>
              List all files in the recordings directory

       <b>/replay</b> <b>load</b> {<u>filename</u> | <u>#index</u>}
              Load the specified recording file by name, or by index
              (same indices as produced by the 'replay list' command)

       <b>/replay</b> <b>loop</b>
              Start looping the recording. This will oftentimes require that all players connected
              to the server rejoin  (to reload the map, etc...)

       <b>/replay</b> <b>play</b>
              Start playing the recording. This will oftentimes require that all players connected
              to the server rejoin  (to reload the map, etc...)

       <b>/replay</b> <b>skip</b> [{<u>+</u> | <u>-</u>} <u>seconds</u>]
              If seconds is specified, then skip that amount of time in the recording.
              Otherwise, skip forwards until there is activity.

       <b>/replay</b> <b>stats</b>
              Show the current replay status (filename, position, etc...)

       <b>/say</b> <u>message</u>
              Generate a public message sent by the server. Example:
              /say This is a servermessage

       <b>/sendhelp</b> {<u>"Player</u> <u>name"</u> | <u>playerName</u> | <u>#slot</u>} <u>help</u> <u>page</u>
              Send the specified help page to a user
              /sendhelp register "Foo"
              Send the the help page 'register' to the player Foo

       <b>/shutdownserver</b>
              Stop serving BZFlag on this server

       <b>/superkill</b>
              Kick all players off the server

       <b>/unmute</b> {<u>#slot</u> | <u>callsign</u>}
              Allows a server admin to restore the TALK permission to a previously muted
              player.

       <b>/veto</b>  If there is a poll active, this will cancel the poll.  By default, you must be
              an admin to veto a poll.

       <b>/viewreports</b>
              View the server's report file.

</pre><h4><b>USER</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Generally, you start with empty files for the user and password databases.  These are maintained  by  the
       server,  and  modifiable  through server commands.  Users in turn belong to groups.  Groups are generally
       customized to perhaps allow administrative control to trusted users.

       There are both local and global groups, i.e. groups that are available across the entire BZFlag  network.
       In  setting  up  a  server,  you may want to specify global groups that will allow already well known and
       trusted users to police your server and help maintain control against cheaters and abuse.

       The server will automatically create three groups: EVERYONE, VERIFIED, and  LOCAL.ADMIN.   EVERYONE   has
       ACTIONMESSAGE,  ADMINMESSAGESEND,  CLIENTQUERY,  DATE,  FLAGHISTORY, IDLESTATS, LAGSTATS, PRIVATEMESSAGE,
       SHOWMOTTO, SPAWN and TALK by default.  VERIFIED  has  LISTPLUGINS,  POLL,  POLLKICK,  POLLBAN,  POLLKICK,
       POLLSET,  POLLFLAGRESET,  REPORT  and  VOTE.   The LOCAL.ADMIN group has almost every permission possible
       (similar to granting admin powers via /password).

       Once the server is  running,  users  can  register  their  callsigns  and  admins  can  set  their  group
       memberships.  Users  can  use any command that their permissions allow. Every user, registered or not, is
       part of the EVERYONE group. When a user identifies, they become part of the VERIFIED group.

       In addition, there are global groups available that persist  network-wide.   Users  that  register  their
       callsigns  on  the BZFlag website at https://forums.bzflag.org/ have the ability to globally authenticate
       by providing a password from within the client.  When they authenticate, bzfs will ask the list server if
       they belong to any of the groups listed in your group database file that are not prefixed with  "LOCAL.".
       If  they  are a member of a group in question, then they are granted the permissions you specify for that
       group.

       A group database file is set up to contain the specific local and global groups you care to have on  your
       server  in addition to default groups and exactly which permissions are granted by each.  These files are
       laid out with one line per group, using the following format:

       GROUP_NAME: [*Group] [ +| -| !]perm1 [ +| -| !]perm2 ... permN

       *Group: inherit permissions from existing group "Group"

       +perm: add perm to this group

       -perm: remove perm from this group

       !perm: forbid perm for this group. makes perm inaccessible whether it's granted from another group or not

       If no operator is given with a permission it is handled  like  +perm.  A  group  line  for  a  previously
       existing  group  adds  to  already granted permissions. That way you can spread a group's definition over
       several lines:

       GROUP_NAME: +perm1 +perm2
       GROUP_NAME: +perm3 +perm4 -perm5

       Group names cannot have spaces, quotes, or other special characters in them.  This would be a sample line
       defining a "cop" group:

       COPS: +KICK +SHORTBAN +BANLIST

       Now a group USERADMIN with all permissions granted to COPS plus some additional could look like this:

       USERADMIN: *COPS +BAN +UNBAN

       Probably you want to define customized permissions for the default  group  "VERIFIED"  instead  of  those
       automatically assigned by the server:

       VERIFIED: -ALL +perm1 +perm2 ...

       Or you want to disable the /poll command entirely?

       EVERYONE: !POLL

       To  distinguish  between a group that is local and one that is global, use the "LOCAL." prefix as part of
       the group name, e.g.:

       LOCAL.OPERATOR: BANLIST

       The available permissions are as follows:

       ACTIONMESSAGE       /me
