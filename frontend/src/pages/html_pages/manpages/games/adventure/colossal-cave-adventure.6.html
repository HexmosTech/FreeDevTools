</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       colossal-cave-adventure - text adventure of exploration in Colossal Cave

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>colossal-cave-adventure</b> [<u>SAVEFILE</u>]

       <b>colossal-cave-adventure</b> <b>-h</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Colossal</b> <b>Cave</b> <b>Adventure</b> is a text adventure game of exploration.

              Somewhere  nearby  is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in treasure and gold, though
              it is rumored that some who enter are never seen again.

       Originally named “ADVENT” or “Adventure”, this is the first known work of interactive  fiction.   As  the
       first text adventure game, it is considered the precursor for the adventure game genre.

       In  the game, you control a character through simple text commands to explore a cave rumored to be filled
       with wealth.  You earn predetetermined points for acquiring treasure and escaping the  cave  alive,  with
       the goal to earn the maximum amount of points offered.

       This  is  a  re-implementation  of the “350-point” version, using the same game content from the original
       Crowther and Woods PDP-10 source code of the late 1970s.

       It uses the original text exactly, and emits responses slow enough to read as the  contemporary  terminal
       interfaces did.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Positional</b> <b>Arguments</b>
       <u>SAVEFILE</u>
              The filename of game you have saved.

   <b>Optional</b> <b>Arguments</b>
       <b>--help</b>, <b>-h</b>
              Describe how to use the program.

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Begin</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b>
       Run the command <b>colossal-cave-adventure</b> in a terminal to begin the game:

              $ <b>colossal-cave-adventure</b>
              WELCOME TO ADVENTURE!!  WOULD YOU LIKE INSTRUCTIONS?

              &gt;

   <b>Restore</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>state</b>
       If  you saved the game state with the in-game <b>save</b> <u>SAVEFILE</u> command, you can restore the game to the same
       state by specifying the <u>SAVEFILE</u> name when you invoke the program:

              $ <b>colossal-cave-adventure</b> <b>mygame</b>
              GAME RESTORED
              &gt;

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b>
       At the <b>&gt;</b> prompt, type one‐ or two‐word commands to specify what to do next:

              WELCOME TO ADVENTURE!!  WOULD YOU LIKE INSTRUCTIONS?

              &gt; <b>no</b>
              YOU ARE STANDING AT THE END OF A ROAD BEFORE A SMALL BRICK BUILDING.
              AROUND YOU IS A FOREST.  A SMALL STREAM FLOWS OUT OF THE BUILDING AND
              DOWN A GULLY.

              &gt; <b>go</b> <b>east</b>
              YOU ARE INSIDE A BUILDING, A WELL HOUSE FOR A LARGE SPRING.
              THERE ARE SOME KEYS ON THE GROUND HERE.
              THERE IS A SHINY BRASS LAMP NEARBY.
              THERE IS FOOD HERE.
              THERE IS A BOTTLE OF WATER HERE.

              &gt; <b>get</b> <b>lamp</b>
              OK

              &gt; <b>leave</b>
              YOU'RE AT END OF ROAD AGAIN.

              &gt; <b>go</b> <b>south</b>
              YOU ARE IN A VALLEY IN THE FOREST BESIDE A STREAM TUMBLING ALONG A
              ROCKY BED.

       The original Adventure paid attention to only the first five letters of each command, so a  long  command
       like  <b>inventory</b> could simply be typed as <b>inven</b>.  This package defines a symbol for both versions of every
       long word, so you can type the long or short version as you please.

   <b>Save</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>state</b>
       You can save the current state of your game at any time with the <b>save</b> <u>SAVEFILE</u> command:

              &gt; <b>save</b> <b>mygame</b>
              GAME SAVED
              &gt; <b>quit</b>
              DO YOU REALLY WANT TO QUIT NOW?
              &gt; <b>y</b>
              OK

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>output</b>
       For extra authenticity, the output of the Adventure game is typed to your screen at 1200 baud.  You  will
       note  that  although this prints the text faster than you can read it anyway, your experience of the game
       will improve considerably, especially when a move results in a surprise.

       Why is the game better at 1200 baud?  When a paragraph of text is allowed to appear on the screen all  at
       once,  your  eyes scan the entire paragraph for important information, often ruining any surprises before
       you can then settle down and read it from the beginning.  But at 1200 baud, you wind up reading the  text
       in order as it appears, which unfolds the narrative sequentially as the authors of <b>Adventure</b> intended.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  an  implementation of the <b>Colossal</b> <b>Cave</b> <b>Adventure</b> game, originally written in 1975–1977 by Will
       Crowther and Don Woods.  Crowther's original source code, which had been presumed lost for  decades,  was
       recovered  in 2005 from a backup (dated 1977-03) of Don Woods's student account on the PDP-10 computer at
       the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL).

       This is the <b>adventure</b> distribution, ported from the 1977  FORTRAN  code  to  Python  3  by  Brandon Craig
       Rhodes.
