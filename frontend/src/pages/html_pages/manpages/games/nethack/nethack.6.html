</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>NetHack</u>  is  a display oriented Dungeons &amp; Dragons(tm) - like game.  The standard tty display and command
       structure resemble rogue.

       Other, more graphical display options exist for most platforms.

       To get started you really only need to know two commands.  The command <b>?</b>  will give you  a  list  of  the
       available  commands  (as well as other information) and the command <b>/</b> will identify the things you see on
       the screen.

       To win the game (as opposed to merely playing to beat other people's high scores)  you  must  locate  the
       Amulet  of  Yendor  which  is  somewhere  below the 20th level of the dungeon and get it out.  Few people
       achieve this; most never do.  Those who have go down in history as heroes among heroes -  and  then  they
       find  ways  of making the game even harder.  See the <u>Guidebook</u> section on Conduct if this game has gotten
       too easy for you.

       When the game ends, whether by your dying, quitting, or escaping from the caves, <u>NetHack</u> will give you (a
       fragment of) the list of top scorers.  The scoring is based on many aspects of your behavior, but a rough
       estimate is obtained by taking the amount of gold you've found in the cave plus four  times  your  (real)
       experience.  Precious stones may be worth a lot of gold when brought to the exit.  There is a 10% penalty
       for getting yourself killed.

       The  environment  variable NETHACKOPTIONS can be used to initialize many run-time options.  The ? command
       provides a description of these options and syntax.  (The <b>-dec</b> and <b>-ibm</b> command line options are  equiva‐
       lent  to  the  <b>decgraphics</b>  and <b>ibmgraphics</b> run-time options described there, and are provided purely for
       convenience on systems supporting multiple types of terminals.)

       Because the option list can be very long (particularly when specifying graphics characters), options  may
       also  be  included  in  a  configuration  file.   The default is located in your home directory and named
       .nethackrc on Unix systems.  On Debian systems, use .nethackrc.gnome for the Gnome  windowing  port,  use
       .nethackrc.x11  for the X11 windowing port, and use .nethackrc.qt for the QT windowing port.  You can use
       .nethackrc.tty for the non-graphical version.  The configuration file's location may be specified by set‐
       ting NETHACKOPTIONS to a string consisting of an @ character followed by the filename.

       The <b>-u</b> <u>playername</u> option supplies the answer to the question "Who are you?".  It overrides any name  from
       the  options or configuration file, USER, LOGNAME, or getlogin(), which will otherwise be tried in order.
       If none of these provides a useful name, the player will be asked for one.  Player names (in  conjunction
       with  uids)  are  used to identify save files, so you can have several saved games under different names.
       Conversely, you must use the appropriate player name to restore a saved game.

       A <u>playername</u> suffix can be used to specify the profession, race, alignment and/or gender of  the  charac‐
       ter.   The  full syntax of the playername that includes a suffix is "name-ppp-rrr-aaa-ggg".  "ppp" are at
       least the first three letters of the profession (this can also be specified using a separate  <b>-p</b>  <u>profes‐</u>
       <u>sion</u> option).  "rrr" are at least the first three letters of the character's race (this can also be spec‐
       ified  using  a  separate <b>-r</b> <u>race</u> option).  "aaa" are at least the first three letters of the character's
       alignment, and "ggg" are at least the first three letters of the character's gender.  Any of the parts of
       the suffix may be left out.

       <b>-p</b> <u>profession</u> can be used to determine the character profession, also known as the role.  You can specify
       either the male or female name for the character role, or the first three characters of the  role  as  an
       abbreviation.  <b>-p</b> <b>@</b> has been retained to explicitly request that a random role be chosen.  It may need to
       be  quoted  with a backslash (\@) if @ is the "kill" character (see "stty") for the terminal, in order to
       prevent the current input line from being cleared.

       Likewise, <b>-r</b> <u>race</u> can be used to explicitly request that a race be chosen.

       Leaving out any of these characteristics will result in you being prompted during the  game  startup  for
       the information.

       The  <b>-s</b>  option alone will print out the list of your scores on the current version.  An immediately fol‐
       lowing <b>-v</b> reports on all versions present in the score file.  The <b>-s</b> may also be followed by arguments <b>-p</b>
       and <b>-r</b> to print the scores of particular roles and races only.  It may also be followed by  one  or  more
       player names to print the scores of the players mentioned, by 'all' to print out all scores, or by a num‐
       ber to print that many top scores.

       The <b>-n</b> option suppresses printing of any news from the game administrator.

       The  <b>-D</b> or <b>-X</b> option will start the game in a special non-scoring discovery mode.  <b>-D</b> will, if the player
       is the game administrator, start in debugging (wizard) mode instead.

       The <b>-d</b> option, which must be the first argument if it appears, supplies a directory which is to serve  as
       the  playground.  It overrides the value from NETHACKDIR, HACKDIR, or the directory specified by the game
       administrator during compilation (usually /usr/lib/games/nethack).  This option is usually only useful to
       the game administrator.  The playground must contain several auxiliary files such as help files, the list
       of top scorers, and a subdirectory <u>save</u> where games are saved.

       <b>--showpaths</b> can be used to cause NetHack to show where it is  expecting  to  find  various  configuration
       files.

       <b>--version</b>  can  be used to cause NetHack to show the version information it was compiled with, then exit.
       That will include the <u>git</u> commit hash if the information was available when the game  was  compiled.   On
       some  platforms,  such as windows and macosx, a variation <b>--version:paste</b> can be used to cause NetHack to
       show the version information, then exit, while also leaving a copy of  the  version  information  in  the
       paste buffer or clipboard for potential insertion into things like bug reports.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       Jay  Fenlason  (+ Kenny Woodland, Mike Thome and Jon Payne) wrote the original hack, very much like rogue
       (but full of bugs).

       Andries Brouwer continuously deformed their sources into an entirely different game.

       Mike Stephenson has continued the perversion of sources, adding  various  warped  character  classes  and
       sadistic  traps  with  the  help  of many strange people who reside in that place between the worlds, the
       Usenet Zone.  A number of these miscreants are immortalized in the historical roll of dishonor and  vari‐
       ous other places.

       The  resulting  mess is now called NetHack, to denote its development by the Usenet.  Andries Brouwer has
       made this request for the distinction, as he may eventually release a new version of his own.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Run-time configuration options were discussed above and use a platform specific name  for  a  file  in  a
       platform specific location.  For Unix, the name is '.nethackrc' in the user's home directory.

       All  other  files  are  in the playground directory, normally /usr/lib/games/nethack.  If DLB was defined
       during the compile, the data files and special levels will be  inside  a  larger  file,  normally  nhdat,
       instead of being separate files.
