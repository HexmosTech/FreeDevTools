</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nettoe - Networked version of Tic Tac Toe for the console.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nettoe</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>netToe</b> is a console-based version of the classic game "Tic Tac Toe".  It is playable against computer AI,
       against a player on the same machine, or against another player over the network.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-4</b>, <b>--ipv4</b>
              only IPv4 networking

       <b>-6</b>, <b>--ipv6</b>
              only IPv6 networking

       <b>-nc</b>, <b>--no-colors</b>
              disable colors

       <b>-nb</b>, <b>--no-beep</b>
              disable beeps

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              display usage hints, then exit

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
              output version information, then exit

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>PLAY</b> <b>VIA</b> <b>NETWORK</b></h4><pre>
       First  decide  who  will  host  the  game:  you  or  your  opponent.  The hosting player must next do the
       following.

       *   Start <b>nettoe</b>.

       *   Pick the third option (Two players over network) of the <u>Main</u> <u>Menu</u>.

       *   Choose the first option (Host the Game) at the <u>Network</u> <u>Game</u> <u>Menu</u>.

       *   Type name, or nickname.

       *   Communicate the IP address to the other player.  Hostnames work, if registered.  We hope you know how
           to get your own IP address.

       *   Wait for the other player to connect to your host.

       Now the other player, the one connecting to the game server, must:

       o   Start <b>nettoe</b>.

       o   Pick the third option (Two players over network) of the <u>Main</u> <u>Menu</u>.

       o   Use the second option (Connect to a host) at the <u>Network</u> <u>Game</u> <u>Menu</u>.

       o   Type name, or nickname.

       o   Type the IP address of the server host, or its hostname.  Examples include <u>192.168.0.5</u>  and  <u>::1</u>,  or
           <u>fenrir.foe.org</u> and <u>localhost</u>.

       o   Wait for the game to start.

       Enjoy yourselves. If you have any problem, just let us know.

</pre><h4><b>NETWORK</b> <b>PORTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>netToe</b>  uses  TCP  port  <b>7501</b>  as listening port of the server engine, unless configured otherwise during
       build time.  Use "nettoe -v" to display the configured port.

       That port must therefore be usable as destination port over the network.  Otherwise  remote  games  would
       not  be  possible.   For  a local game this is of course mostly irrelevant, but filtering firewalls might
       intercept connections in general.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>AI</b> <b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>netToe</b> offers a mode of play where the computer acts as opponent with some limited built-in abilities  to
       simulate dynamic decisions.  Three levels of AI strength are made available:

       *   The  weaker level first checks a small set of blocking moves, then some winning moves, and falls back
           to simple moves in a fixed priority order.  Since neither set is adaptive,  the  computer  is  easily
           fooled.

       *   The  normal  level  uses  slightly larger sets of moves at each step, but is most importantly playing
           more aggressively than the weaker level does.  It happens in the sense that initial  checks  are  for
           winning  moves,  only  later  falling  back  to blocking moves.  This avoids some obvious counterfeit
           strategy by a human player.

       *   The better of the three levels is implemented differently.  Its first action is to  scan  a  complete
           set  of  winning  moves.   That  leading  nowhere,  it scans through all possible blocking moves, and
           finally falls back to an ordered list of simple moves.  Since not even this level of play is using  a
           look-ahead  search,  a human player can set up traps, but finding those already demands a fair amount
           of insight into the game!

       There are plans for a further level using a look-ahead search of  depth  two.   This  would  improve  the
       usefulness  of  <b>netToe</b> as an educational tool.  A further level, which is learning from past plays within
       each session, could also be an interesting enhancement.
