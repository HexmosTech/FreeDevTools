</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MAME - Multi-purpose emulation framework

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mame</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>gamename</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Started  in 1997 by Nicola Salmoria, MAME was originally intended as a series of emulators for individual
       games, which were later combined into a single multi-game emulator. In the  following  years,  MAME  grew
       over and over up to the actual size, with more than 100 contributors to the project.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Core</b> <b>commands</b>
       <b>-help,</b> <b>-?</b>
              Displays current MAME version and copyright notice.

       <b>-validate,</b> <b>-valid</b>
              Performs  internal validation on every driver in the system. Run this before submitting changes to
              ensure that you haven't violated any of the core system rules.

   <b>Configuration</b> <b>commands</b>
       <b>-createconfig,</b> <b>-cc</b>
              Creates the default <b>mame.ini</b> file in the current directory. All  the  configuration  options  (not
              commands) described below can be permanently changed by editing this configuration file.

       <b>-showconfig,</b> <b>-sc</b>
              Displays the current configuration settings.

       <b>-showusage,</b> <b>-su</b>
              Displays  a  summary of all the command line options. For options that are not mentioned here, the
              short summary given by <b>-showusage</b> is usually sufficient.

   <b>Frontend</b> <b>commands</b>
       All the list commands below write info to the screen.  If you wish  to  write  the  info  to  a  textfile
       instead,  use redirection.  For example, <b>mame</b> <b>-listxml</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b><a href="file:~/mamelist.xml">~/mamelist.xml</a></b> writes the full list of supported
       game to file <u>mamelist.xml</u> in your home directory.

       <b>-listxml,</b> <b>-lx</b> [<u>gamename</u>|<u>wildcard</u>]
              List comprehensive details for all of the supported games. The output is  quite  long,  so  it  is
              usually  better  to  redirect this into a file.  The output is in XML format. By default all games
              are listed; however, you can limit this list by specifying a driver name  or  wildcard  after  the
              -listxml command.

       <b>-listfull,</b> <b>-ll</b> [<u>gamename</u>|<u>wildcard</u>]
              Displays  a  list of game driver names and descriptions. By default all games are listed; however,
              you can limit this list by specifying a driver name or wildcard after the -listfull command.

       <b>-listsource,</b> <b>-ls</b> [<u>gamename</u>|<u>wildcard</u>]
              Displays a list of drivers and the names of the source files their game drivers  live  in.  Useful
              for  finding  which  driver  a game runs on in order to fix bugs. By default all games are listed;
              however, you can limit this list by specifying a driver name or  wildcard  after  the  -listsource
              command.

       <b>-listclones,</b> <b>-lc</b> [<u>gamename</u>|<u>wildcard</u>]
              Displays  a  list of clones. By default all clones are listed; however, you can limit this list by
              specifying a driver name or wildcard after the -listclones command.

       <b>-listbrothers,</b> <b>-lb</b> [<u>gamename</u>|<u>wildcard</u>]
              Displays a list of "brothers" or other drivers from same sourcefile.  By  default  all  games  are
              listed;  however,  you  can  limit  this  list  by  specifying a driver name or wildcard after the
              -listbrothers command.

       <b>-listcrc</b>
              Displays a full list of CRCs of all ROM images referenced by all drivers within MAME code.

       <b>-listroms,</b> <b>-lr</b> <u>gamename</u>
              Displays a list of ROM images referenced by the specified game.

       <b>-listsamples</b> <u>gamename</u>
              Displays a list of samples referenced by the specified game.

       <b>-verifyroms</b> [<u>gamename</u>|<u>wildcard</u>]
              Checks for invalid or missing ROM images. By default all drivers that  have  valid  ZIP  files  or
              directories  in the rom path are verified; however, you can limit this list by specifying a driver
              name or wildcard after the -verifyroms command.

       <b>-verifysamples</b> [<u>gamename</u>|<u>wildcard</u>]
              Checks for invalid or missing samples. By default  all  drivers  that  have  valid  ZIP  files  or
              directories  in  the  samplepath  are  verified;  however, you can limit this list by specifying a
              driver name or wildcard after the -verifyroms command.

       <b>-romident</b>
              Attempts to identify ROM files, if they  are  known  to  MAME,  in  the  specified  .zip  file  or
              directory.  This  command  can  be used to try and identify ROM sets taken from unknown boards. On
              exit, the errorlevel is returned as one of the following:
              <b>0</b>  all files were identified
              <b>7</b>  all files were identified except for some "non-ROM" files
              <b>8</b>  some files were identified
              <b>9</b>  no files were identified

       <b>-listdevices,</b> <b>-ld</b>
              Output the list of devices referenced by a given game or set of games.

       <b>-listslots,</b> <b>-lslot</b>
              Output the list of available slots and slot devices for the system.

       <b>-listmedia,</b> <b>-lm</b>
              Output the list of available media for the system.

       <b>-listsoftware,</b> <b>-lsoft</b>
              Output the list of known software for the system.

       <b>-verifysoftware,</b> <b>-vsoft</b> [<u>gamename</u>|<u>wildcard</u>]
              Checks for invalid or missing ROM images in your software lists.  By default all drivers that have
              valid ZIP files or directories in the rompath are verified; however, you can limit  this  list  by
              specifying a specific driver name or wildcard.

       <b>-getsoftlist,</b> <b>-glist</b>
              Retrieve software list by name.

       <b>-verifysoftlist,</b> <b>-vlist</b> [<u>softwarelistname</u>]
              Checks   a   specified   software   list  for  missing  ROM  images  if  files  exist  for  issued
              softwarelistname. By default, all drivers that have valid ZIP files or directories in the  rompath
              are  verified; however, you can limit this list by specifying a specific softwarelistname (without
              .XML).

       <b>-listmidi,</b> <b>-mlist</b>
              Create a list of list available MIDI I/O devices for use with emulation.

       <b>-listnetwork,</b> <b>-nlist</b>
              List available network adapters.

   <b>Configuration</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-[no]readconfig,</b> <b>-[no]rc</b>
              Enables or disables the reading of the config files. When enabled (which  is  the  default),  MAME
              reads the following config files in order:
              1. <b>mame.ini</b>
              the main configuration file
              2. <u>name</u><b>.ini</b>
              where  <u>name</u>  is your executable name, i.e. mame unless you changed it (e.g. if you renamed mame to
              mame0137, the parsed file will be <u>mame0137.ini</u>)
              3. <b>debug.ini</b>, if the debugger is enabled
              4. <b>vector.ini</b>, for vector games only
              5. <u>[driver]</u><b>.ini</b>
              based on the source filename of the game driver
              6. <u>[parent]</u><b>.ini</b>
              for clones only, may be called recursively
              7. <u>[gamename]</u><b>.ini</b>
              note this sometimes resolves to the same of the source driver
              The settings in the later ini's override those in the earlier ini's.   So,  for  example,  if  you
              wanted  to  disable  overlay  effects  in  the  vector games, you can create a vector.ini with the
              "effect none" line in it, and it will override whatever effect value you have  in  your  mame.ini.
              The default is ON (-readconfig).

       <b>-[no]writeconfig,</b> <b>-[no]wc</b>
              Write configuration to <u>[driver]</u>.ini on exit.  Default is OFF (-nowriteconfig).

   <b>Search</b> <b>path</b> <b>options</b>
       Be  careful  to  use the path, directory and file options in mame.ini <b>ONLY</b>. Otherwise, the outcome may be
       unpredictable and not consistent across releases.

       <b>-rompath,</b> <b>-rp,</b> <b>-biospath,</b> <b>-bp</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies a list of paths within which to find ROM or hard disk images.   Multiple  paths  can  be
              specified  by separating them with semicolons.  The default is 'roms' (that is, a directory "roms"
              in the same directory as the MAME executable).

       <b>-hashpath</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies a list of paths within which to search for software hash files.  Multiple paths  can  be
              specified  by separating them with semicolons.  The default is 'hash' (that is, a directory 'hash'
              in the same directory as the MAME executable).

       <b>-samplepath,</b> <b>-sp</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies a list of paths within which to find sample files. Multiple paths can  be  specified  by
              separating  them  with semicolons. The default is 'samples' (that is, a directory "samples" in the
              same directory as the MAME executable).

       <b>-artpath,</b> <b>-artwork_directory</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies a list of paths within which to find artwork files. Multiple paths can be  specified  by
              separating  them  with semicolons. The default is 'artwork' (that is, a directory "artwork" in the
              same directory as the MAME executable).

       <b>-ctrlrpath,</b> <b>-ctrlr_directory</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies a list of paths within which to find controller-specific configuration  files.  Multiple
              paths  can  be  specified  by  separating them with semicolons. The default is 'ctrlr' (that is, a
              directory "ctrlr" in the same directory as the MAME executable).

       <b>-inipath</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies a list of paths within which to find .INI files. Multiple  paths  can  be  specified  by
              separating them with semicolons. The default is '/etc/mame/'.

       <b>-fontpath</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies a list of paths within which to find .BDF font files. Multiple paths can be specified by
              separating  them with semicolons. The default is '.' (that is, search in the same directory as the
              MAME executable).

       <b>-cheatpath</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies a list of paths within which to find cheat files. Multiple paths  can  be  specified  by
              separating  them with semicolons. The default is 'cheat' (that is, a directory 'cheat' in the same
              directory as the MAME executable).

       <b>-crosshairpath</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies a list of paths within which to find crosshair files. Multiple paths can be specified by
              separating them with semicolons. The default is 'crosshair' (that is, a directory  "crosshair"  in
              the  same directory as the MAME executable).  If the Crosshair is set to default in the menu, MAME
              will look for gamenamespecified crosshairpath, where # is the player number.  Failing  that,  MAME
              will use built-in default crosshairs.

       <b>-pluginspath</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies  a  single  path  within  which  to  find  plugins. The default is 'plugins' (that is, a
              directory 'plugins' in the same directory as the MAME executable).

       <b>-languagepath</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies a single path within which to find language files. The default is 'language' (that is, a
              directory 'language' in the same directory as the MAME executable).

   <b>Output</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-cfg_directory</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies a single directory where configuration files are stored.  Configuration files store user
              configurable settings that are read at startup and written when MAME exits. The default  is  'cfg'
              (that  is, a directory "cfg" in the same directory as the MAME executable). If this directory does
              not exist, it will be automatically created.

       <b>-nvram_directory</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies a single directory where NVRAM files are stored.  NVRAM  files  store  the  contents  of
              EEPROM  and non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) for games which used this type of hardware. This data is read
              at startup and written when MAME exits. The default is 'nvram' (that is, a  directory  "nvram"  in
              the  same  directory  as  the  MAME  executable).  If  this  directory  does not exist, it will be
              automatically created.

       <b>-input_directory</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies a single directory where input recording files are stored.  Input recordings are created
              via the -record option and played back via the -playback option. The default is 'inp' (that is,  a
              directory  "inp"  in the same directory as the MAME executable). If this directory does not exist,
              it will be automatically created.

       <b>-state_directory</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies a single directory where save state files are stored. Save  state  files  are  read  and
              written  either  upon user request, or when using the -autosave option. The default is 'sta' (that
              is, a directory "sta" in the same directory as the MAME executable). If this  directory  does  not
              exist, it will be automatically created.

       <b>-snapshot_directory</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies  a  single  directory where screen snapshots are stored, when requested by the user. The
              default is 'snap' (that is, a directory "snap" in the same directory as the MAME  executable).  If
              this directory does not exist, it will be automatically created.

       <b>-diff_directory</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies  a  single  directory  where  hard  drive  differencing  files  are  stored.  Hard drive
              differencing files store any data that is written back to a hard disk image, in order to  preserve
              the  original  image.  The  differencing files are created at startup when a game with a hard disk
              image. The default is 'diff' (that is, a directory "diff"  in  the  same  directory  as  the  MAME
              executable). If this directory does not exist, it will be automatically created.

       <b>-comment_directory</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies  a single directory where debugger comment files are stored.  Debugger comment files are
              written by the debugger when comments are added to the disassembly for  a  game.  The  default  is
              'comments'  (that  is,  a  directory "comments" in the same directory as the MAME executable).  If
              this directory does not exist, it will be automatically created.

   <b>State/playback</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-state</b> <u>slot</u>
              Immediately after starting the specified game, will cause the save state in the specified <u>slot</u>  to
              be loaded.

       <b>-[no]autosave</b>
              When enabled, automatically creates a save state file when exiting MAME and automatically attempts
              to  reload  it  when  later  starting MAME with the same game. This only works for games that have
              explicitly enabled save state support in their driver. The default is OFF (-noautosave).

       <b>-playback,</b> <b>-pb</b> <u>filename</u>
              Specifies a file from which to play back a series of game  inputs.  This  feature  does  not  work
              reliably  for all games, but can be used to watch a previously recorded game session from start to
              finish. In order to make  things  consistent,  you  should  only  record  and  playback  with  all
              configuration  (.cfg),  NVRAM  (.nv),  and  memory  card  files  deleted.  The default is NULL (no
              playback).

       <b>-[no]exit_after_playback</b>
              If play back is enabled (see -playback option) the program exits when  end  of  file  is  reached.
              Otherwise the machine will continue to run.  Default is OFF (-noexit_after_playback).

       <b>-record,</b> <b>-rec</b> <u>filename</u>
              Specifies  a  file  to  record  all  input  from a game session. This can be used to record a game
              session for later playback. This feature does not work reliably for all games, but can be used  to
              watch a previously recorded game session from start to finish. In order to make things consistent,
              you  should  only  record and playback with all configuration (.cfg), NVRAM (.nv), and memory card
              files deleted. The default is NULL (no recording).

       <b>-[no]record_timecode</b>
              Specify whether to create a timecode file. It contains a line with elapsed times on each press  of
              timecode  shortcut  key  (default  is F12).  This option works only when recording mode is enabled
              (-record option).  The file is saved on inp folder.  Default is OFF (-norecord_timecode).

       <b>-mngwrite</b> <u>filename</u>
              Writes each video frame to the given <u>filename</u> in MNG format, producing an  animation  of  the game
              session.  Note  that  -mngwrite  only  writes  video  frames; it does not save any audio data. Use
              -wavwrite for that, and reassemble the audio/video using offline tools. The default  is  NULL  (no
              recording).

       <b>-aviwrite</b> <u>filename</u>
              Stream  video  and  sound  data to the given <u>filename</u> in AVI format, producing an animation of the
              game session complete with sound. The default is NULL (no recording).

       <b>-wavwrite</b> <u>filename</u>
              Writes the final mixer output to the given <u>filename</u> in WAV format, producing an audio recording of
              the     game session. The default is NULL (no recording).

       <b>-snapname</b> <u>string</u>
              Describes how MAME should name files for snapshots. <u>string</u> provides a template  that  is  used  to
              generate  a filename. Three simple substitutions are provided: the / character represents the path
              separator on any target platform (even Windows); the literal <b>%g</b> represents the driver name of  the
              current  game;  and  the  literal <b>%i</b> represents an incrementing index. If <b>%i</b> is omitted, then each
              snapshot taken will overwrite the previous one; otherwise, MAME will find the next empty value for
              <b>%i</b> and use that for a filename. The default is <b>%g/%i</b>, which creates a  separate  folder  for  each
              game,  and  names the snapshots under it starting with 0000 and increasing from there. Example: if
              you use <b>mame</b>  <b>robby</b>  <b>-snapname</b>  <b>foo/%g%i</b>  snapshots  will  be  saved  as  <b>snaps/foo/robby0000.png</b>,
              <b>snaps/foo/robby0001.png</b> and so on.

       <b>-snapsize</b> <u>width</u><b>x</b><u>height</u>
              Hard-codes  the  size for snapshots and movie recording. By default, MAME will create snapshots at
              the game's current resolution in raw pixels,  and  will  create  movies  at  the  game's  starting
              resolution  in  raw  pixels.  If you specify this option, then MAME will create both snapshots and
              movies at the size specified, and will bilinear filter the result. Note that this  size  does  not
              automatically rotate if the game is vertically oriented. The default is 'auto'.

       <b>-snapview</b> <b>internal</b>|<b>auto</b>|<u>viewname</u>
              Specifies  the  view  to  use  when rendering snapshots and movies. By default, both use a special
              'internal' view, which renders a separate snapshot per screen or renders movies only of the  first
              screen. By specifying this option, you can override this default behavior and select a single view
              that  will  apply  to  all snapshots and movies.  Note that <u>viewname</u> does not need to be a perfect
              match; rather, it will select the first view whose name matches all the  characters  specified  by
              <u>viewname</u>. For example, -snapview native will match the "Native (15:14)" view even though it is not
              a  perfect  match.   <u>viewname</u>  can  also  be 'auto', which selects the first view with all screens
              present. The default value is 'internal'.

       <b>-[no]snapbilinear</b>
              Specify  whether  snapshot/movie  should  have  bilinear  filtering  applied.    Default   is   ON
              (-snapbilinear).

       <b>-statename</b> <u>string</u>
              Describes  how  MAME  should  store save state files, relative to the state_directory path. <u>string</u>
              provides a template that is used to  generate  a  relative  path.  Two  simple  substitutions  are
              provided: the / character represents the path separator on any target platform (even Windows); the
              literal  <b>%g</b>  represents  the driver name of the current game. The default is '%g', which creates a
              separate folder for each game. Example: if you use <b>mame</b> <b>robby</b> <b>-statename</b> <b>foo/%g</b> save  states  will
              be stored inside <b>sta/foo/robby/</b>.

       <b>-[no]burnin</b>
              Tracks  brightness  of the screen during play and at the end of emulation generates a PNG that can
              be used to simulate burn-in effects on other games. The resulting PNG is  created  such  that  the
              least-used  areas of the screen are fully white (since burned-in areas are darker, all other areas
              of the screen must be lightened a touch).  The intention is that this PNG can  be  loaded  via  an
              artwork  file  with  a  low  alpha  (e.g,  0.1-0.2 seems to work well) and blended over the entire
              screen. The PNG files are saved in the snap directory under the gamename\burnin-&lt;screen.name&gt;.png.
              The default is OFF (-noburnin).

   <b>Performance</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-[no]autoframeskip,</b> <b>-[no]afs</b>
              Automatically determines  the  frameskip  level  while  you're  playing  the  game,  adjusting  it
              constantly  in a frantic attempt to keep the game running at full speed. Turning this on overrides
              the value you have set for -frameskip below. The default is OFF (-noautoframeskip).

       <b>-frameskip,</b> <b>-fs</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies the frameskip value (autoframeskip must be disabled). This is the number of  frames  out
              of  every 12 to drop when running. For example, if you say -frameskip 2, then MAME will display 10
              out of every 12 frames. By skipping those frames, you may be able to get full speed in a game that
              requires more horsepower than your computer has. The default value is 0, which skips no frames.

       <b>-seconds_to_run,</b> <b>-str</b> <u>value</u>
              This option can be used for benchmarking and automated testing. It tells MAME  to  stop  execution
              after a fixed number of seconds. By combining this with a fixed set of other command line options,
              you can set up a consistent environment for benchmarking MAME performance. In addition, upon exit,
              the -str option will write a screenshot called final.png to the game's snapshot directory.

       <b>-[no]throttle</b>
              Configures  the  default throttling setting. When throttling is on, MAME attempts to keep the game
              running at the game's intended speed. When throttling is off, MAME runs the game  as  fast  as  it
              can.  Note that the fastest speed is more often than not limited by your graphics card, especially
              for older games. The default is ON (-throttle).

       <b>-[no]sleep</b>
              Allows MAME to give time back to the system  when  running  with  -throttle.   This  allows  other
              programs  to  have  some CPU time, assuming that the game isn't taxing 100% of your CPU resources.
              This option can potentially cause hiccups in performance if other demanding programs are  running.
              The default is ON (-sleep).

       <b>-speed</b> <u>value</u>
              Controls the speed of gameplay, relative to realtime; smaller numbers are slower. Default is 1.00.

       <b>-[no]refreshspeed,</b> <b>-[no]rs</b>
              Automatically  adjusts  the  <b>-speed</b> parameter to keep the effective refresh rate below that of the
              lowest screen refresh rate.  Default is OFF (-norefreshspeed).

       <b>-numprocessors,</b> <b>-np</b> <u>value</u>
              Set number of processors; this overrides the number the system reports.

       <b>-bench</b> <u>value</u>
              Benchmark for the given number of emulated seconds; implies -video none -sound none -nothrottle.

       <b>-[no]sdlvideofps</b>
              Show SDL video performance. Default is OFF (-nosdlvideofps).

   <b>Rotation</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-[no]rotate</b>
              Rotate the game to match its normal state (horizontal/vertical). This ensures that both vertically
              and horizontally oriented games show up correctly without the need to rotate your monitor. If  you
              want  to  keep  the  game displaying 'raw' on the screen the way it would have in the arcade, turn
              this option OFF. The default is ON (-rotate).

       <b>-[no]ror</b> <b>|</b> <b>-[no]rol</b>
              Rotate the game screen to the right (clockwise) or left (counter- clockwise)  relative  to  either
              its  normal  state  (if  -rotate  is  specified)  or its native state (if -norotate is specified).
              Default for both is OFF (-noror -norol).

       <b>-[no]autoror</b> <b>|</b> <b>-[no]autorol</b>
              These options are designed for use with pivoting screens that only pivot in a single direction. If
              your screen only pivots clockwise, use -autorol to ensure that  the  game  will  fill  the  screen
              either  horizontally  or  vertically in one of the directions you can handle.  If your screen only
              pivots counter-clockwise, use -autoror.  Default for both is OFF (-noautoror -noautorol).

       <b>-[no]flipx</b> <b>-[no]flipy</b>
              Flip (mirror) the game screen either horizontally (-flipx) or vertically (-flipy). The  flips  are
              applied  after  the  -rotate and -ror/-rol options are applied.  Default for both is OFF (-noflipx
              -noflipy).

   <b>Artwork</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-[no]artwork_crop,</b> <b>-[no]artcrop</b>
              Enable cropping of artwork to the game screen area only. This option can also  be  controlled  via
              the Video Options menu in the user interface. The default is OFF (-noartwork_crop).

       <b>-[no]use_backdrops,</b> <b>-[no]backdrop</b>
              Enables/disables the display of backdrops. The default is ON (-use_backdrops).

       <b>-[no]use_overlays,</b> <b>-[no]overlay</b>
              Enables/disables the display of overlays. The default is ON (-use_overlays).

       <b>-[no]use_bezels,</b> <b>-[no]bezel</b>
              Enables/disables the display of bezels. The default is ON (-use_bezels).

       <b>-[no]use_cpanels,</b> <b>-[no]cpanel</b>
              Enables/disables the display of cpanels. The default is ON (-use_bezels).

       <b>-[no]use_marquees,</b> <b>-[no]marquee</b>
              Enables/disables the display of marquees. The default is ON (-use_bezels).

   <b>Screen</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-brightness</b> <u>value</u>
              Controls the default brightness, or black level, of the game screens.  This option does not affect
              the  artwork  or  other  parts  of  the  display.  Using the MAME UI, you can individually set the
              brightness for each game screen; this option controls the  initial  value  for  all  visible  game
              screens.  The  standard value is 1.0. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1) will produce a darkened
              display, while selecting higher values (up to 2.0) will give a brighter display.  The  default  is
              1.0.

       <b>-contrast</b> <u>value</u>
              Controls  the  contrast,  or  white  level,  of  the game screens. This option does not affect the
              artwork or other parts of the display. Using the MAME UI, you can individually  set  the  contrast
              for  each  game  screen;  this option controls the initial value for all visible game screens. The
              standard value is 1.0. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1) will produce a dimmer  display,  while
              selecting higher values (up to 2.0) will give a more saturated display. The default is 1.0.

       <b>-gamma</b> <u>value</u>
              Controls  the  gamma,  which  produces  a  potentially nonlinear black to white ramp, for the game
              screens. This option does not affect the artwork or other parts of the display. Using the MAME UI,
              you can individually set the gamma for each game screen; this option controls  the  initial  value
              for  all  visible game screens. The standard value is 1.0, which gives a linear ramp from black to
              white. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1) will increase the  nonlinearity  toward  black,  while
              selecting higher values (up to 3.0) will push the nonlinearity toward white. The default is 1.0.

       <b>-pause_brightness</b> <u>value</u>
              This controls the brightness level when MAME is paused. The default value is 0.65.

       <b>-effect</b> [<u>none</u>|<u>filename[.png]</u>]
              Name of a PNG file to use for visual effects, or 'none'. Default is 'none'.

   <b>Vector</b> <b>rendering</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-beam_width_min</b> <u>value</u>

       <b>-beam_width_max</b> <u>value</u>
              Sets  the  minimum and maximum width of the vectors. This is a scaling factor against the standard
              vector width, which is interpolated between minimum and maximum according to the beam's intensity.
              A value of 1.0 will keep the default vector line width. Smaller values will reduce the width,  and
              larger values will increase the width. The default is 1.0.

       <b>-beam_intensity_weight</b> <u>value</u>
              Applies  an  exponential  weight  to  the  minimum and maximum beam width. For positive values the
              interpolated scaling factor will affect lines with higher intensity more  than  lines  with  lower
              intensity. The default is 0.0.

       <b>-flicker</b> <u>value</u>
              Simulates  a  vector  "flicker"  effect,  similar  to a vector monitor that needs adjustment. This
              option requires a float argument in the range of 0.00-100.00 (0=none, 100=maximum). The default is
              0.

   <b>Video</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-video</b> [<u>soft</u>|<u>opengl</u>|<u>bgfx</u>|<u>none</u>]
              Specifies which video subsystem to use for drawing:
              <b>soft</b>  uses software rendering, which is slower but more compatible.
              <b>opengl</b>  uses OpenGL and your graphics accelerator  to  speed  up  many  aspects  of  drawing  MAME
              including  compositing  artwork, overlays, and bezels, as well as stretching the image to fit your
              screen.
              <b>bgfx</b>  uses the bgfx renderer which supports portable shaders and multiple graphics APIs  including
              OpenGL, OpenGL ES and DirectX.
              <b>none</b>  does no drawing and is intended for CPU benchmarking.
              Default is 'soft' on Linux or 'opengl' on macOS.

       <b>-numscreens</b> [<u>1-4</u>]
              Number of screens to create; usually, you want just one. Default is '1'.

       <b>-[no]window,</b> <b>-[no]w</b>
              Run  MAME in either full screen or a window. This is a fully-featured window mode where the window
              resizes as necessary to track what the game does.  And you can resize it  yourself with your  OS's
              standard window controls.  The default is OFF (-nowindow).

       <b>-[no]maximize,</b> <b>-[no]max</b>
              Controls  initial  window size in windowed mode. If it is set on, the window will initially be set
              to the maximum supported size when you start MAME. If it is turned off, the window will start  out
              at  the  smallest  supported size. This option only has an effect when the -window option is used.
              The default is ON (-maximize).

       <b>-[no]keepaspect,</b> <b>-[no]ka</b>
              Forces the correct aspect ratio. This means when you're resizing the window in windowed  mode  the
              actual game image will resize in discrete steps to maintain the proper shape of the game graphics.
              If  you  turn  this off you can resize the window to anything you like and get funny squishing and
              stretching.  The same applies for full-screen. Default is ON (-keepaspect).

       <b>-[no]unevenstretch,</b> <b>-[no]ues</b>
              Allow non-integer stretch factors. Video purists should stay far, far away from this option, while
              everyone else will be happy to know that it lets you fill the screen properly in full-screen mode.
              Default is ON (-unevenstretch).

       <b>-[no]unevenstretchx,</b> <b>-[no]uesx</b>
              Act as -[no]unevenstretch on horizontal basis only.

       <b>-[no]intoverscan,</b> <b>-[no]ios</b>
              Allow overscan on integer scaled targets.

       <b>-intscalex,</b> <b>-sx</b>
              Set horizontal integer scale factor.

       <b>-intscaley,</b> <b>-sy</b>
              Set vertical integer scale factor.

       <b>-[no]centerh</b>
              Center horizontally within the view area. Default is ON (-centerh).

       <b>-[no]centerv</b>
              Center vertically within the view area. Default is ON (-centerv).

       <b>-[no]waitvsync,</b> <b>-[no]vs</b>
              Enable waiting for the start of VBLANK before flipping screens; reduces tearing  effects.  Default
              is OFF (-nowaitvsync).

       <b>-[no]syncrefresh,</b> <b>-[no]srf</b>
              Enable  using  the  start  of  VBLANK  for  throttling  instead  of the game time.  Default is OFF
              (-nosyncrefresh).

   <b>BGFX</b> <b>post-processing</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>NOTE:</b>  All  the  options in this group are available only when BGFX video post-processing is enabled, i.e
       <b>-video</b> <b>bgfx</b>. For full info on BGFX please visit official MAME documentation page:
       <a href="http://docs.mamedev.org/advanced/bgfx.html">http://docs.mamedev.org/advanced/bgfx.html</a>

       <b>-bgfx_path</b> <u>pathname</u>
              This is where your BGFX shader files are stored.  The default is  'bgfx'  (that  is,  a  directory
              "bgfx" in the same directory as the MAME executable).

       <b>-bgfx_backend</b> <u>auto</u>|<u>opengl</u>
              Selects a rendering backend for BGFX to use. The default is 'auto', which will let MAME choose the
              best selection for you.

       <b>-bgfx_debug</b>
              Enables BGFX debugging features. Most users will not need to use this.

       <b>-bgfx_screen_chains</b> <u>default</u>|<u>unfiltered</u>|<u>hlsl</u>[,...]
              This  dictates  how to handle BGFX rendering on a per-display basis.  For each display specify one
              of the possible choices:
              <b>default</b>     default bilinear filterered output
              <b>unfiltered</b>  nearest neighbor unfiltered output
              <b>hlsl</b>        HLSL display simulation through shaders
              Separate directives for each window with a comma (,) and for each physical  screen  with  a  colon
              (:).  For  example,  for  an  emulated game with 3 displays emulated on 3 windows on your monitor,
              <b>-bgfx_screen_chains</b> <b>default,unfiltered,default</b> specifies to apply default filter on what  is  been
              rendered on the first and third window and leave the content of the second window unfiltered.

       <b>-bgfx_shadow_mask</b> <u>filename</u>
              This specifies the shadow mask effect PNG file. Default is 'slot-mask.png'.

       <b>-bgfx_avi_name</b> <u>filename</u>
              This specifies a filename for BGFX output logging.

   <b>Full</b> <b>screen</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-[no]switchres</b>
              Affects  full  screen  mode  only.  Chooses if MAME can try to change the screen resolution (color
              depth is normally left alone) when in full-screen mode. If it's off, you always get  your  desktop
              resolution in full-screen mode (which can be useful for LCDs). Default is OFF (-noswitchres).

       <b>-[no]useallheads</b>
              Split full screen image across monitors. Default is OFF (-nouseallheads).

   <b>Sound</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-sound</b> [<u>sdl</u>|<u>portaudio</u>|<u>coreaudio</u>|<u>dsound</u>|<u>xaudio2</u>|<u>none</u>]
              Specifies which sound subsystem to use for audio output:
              <b>sdl</b>  uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer audio output system (not available on Windows by default).
              <b>portaudio</b>  uses the PortAudio library which supports low-latency output and multiple audio APIs.
              <b>coreaudio</b>   uses  the Core Audio API which supports low-latency output and AudioUnit effects (only
              available on macOS).
              <b>dsound</b>  uses the DirectSound API (only available on Windows).
              <b>xaudio2</b>  uses the XAudio2 API which supports low-latency output (only available on Windows).
              <b>none</b>  produces no audio output.
              Default is 'dsound' on Windows, 'coreaudio' on macOS or 'sdl' on other platforms.

       <b>-samplerate,</b> <b>-srf</b> <u>value</u>
              Sets the audio sample rate. Smaller values (e.g. 11025)  cause  lower  audio  quality  but  faster
              emulation speed. Higher values (e.g. 48000) cause higher audio quality but slower emulation speed.
              The default is 48000.

       <b>-[no]samples</b>
              Use samples if available. The default is ON (-samples).

       <b>-[no]compressor</b>
              Enable  audio  compressor.  It  temporarily  reduces  the  overall volume when the audio output is
              overdriven. The default is ON (-compressor).

       <b>-volume,</b> <b>-vol</b> <u>value</u>
              Sets the startup volume. It can later be changed with the user interface (see Keys  section).  The
              volume is an attenuation in dB: e.g., "-volume -12" will start with -12dB attenuation. The default
              is 0.

       <b>-audio_latency</b> <u>value</u>
              This controls the amount of latency built into the audio streaming.  The exact behavior depends on
              the selected audio output module (see the -sound option).  Smaller values provide less audio delay
              while  requiring better system performance.  Higher values increase audio delay but may help avoid
              buffer under-runs and audio interruptions.  The default is 1.

   <b>Input</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-[no]coin_lockout,</b> <b>-[no]coinlock</b>
              Enables simulation of the "coin lockout" feature that is implmeneted on a number of game PCBs.  It
              was up to the operator whether or not the coin lockout outputs were actually connected to the coin
              mechanisms.  If this feature is enabled, then attempts to enter a coin while the lockout is active
              will fail and will display a popup message in the user interface. If this feature is disabled, the
              coin lockout signal will be ignored. The default is ON (-coin_lockout).

       <b>-ctrlr</b> <u>controller</u>
              Enables support for special controllers. Configuration files are loaded from the  ctrlrpath.  They
              are  in  the  same format as the .cfg files that are saved, but only control configuration data is
              read from the file. The default is NULL (no controller file).

       <b>-[no]mouse</b>
              Controls whether or not MAME looks for a mouse  controller  to  use.  Note  that  in  many  cases,
              lightguns  are  treated  as mice by the operating system, so you may need to enable this to enable
              lightgun support. When this is enabled, you will not be able to use your  mouse  while  playing  a
              game.  If you want to get control of your computer back, you will need to either pause the game or
              quit. The default is OFF (-nomouse).

       <b>-[no]joystick,</b> <b>-[no]joy</b>
              Controls whether  or  not  MAME  looks  for  joystick/gamepad  controllers.   The  default  is  ON
              (-joystick).

       <b>-[no]lightgun,</b> <b>-[no]gun</b>
              Controls  whether  or not MAME makes use of lightgun controllers.  Note that most lightguns map to
              the mouse, so using -lightgun and -mouse together may produce strange results. The default is  OFF
              (-nolightgun).

       <b>-[no]multikeyboard,</b> <b>-[no]multikey</b>
              Determines  whether  MAME differentiates between multiple keyboards.  Some systems may report more
              than one keyboard; by default, the data from all of these keyboards is combined so that  it  looks
              like  a single keyboard. Turning this option on will enable MAME to report keypresses on different
              keyboards independently. The default is OFF (-nomultikeyboard).

       <b>-[no]multimouse</b>
              Determines whether MAME differentiates between multiple mice. Some systems may  report  more  than
              one  mouse device; by default, the data from all of these mice is combined so that it looks like a
              single mouse. Turning this option on will enable MAME to report mouse movement and button  presses
              on different mice independently. The default is OFF (-nomultimouse).

       <b>-[no]steadykey,</b> <b>-[no]steady</b>
              Some  games  require  two  or  more buttons to be pressed at exactly the same time to make special
              moves. Due to limitations in the PC keyboard hardware, it can be difficult or even  impossible  to
              accomplish  that  using  the  standard keyboard handling. This option selects a different handling
              that makes it easier to register simultaneous button presses, but has the disadvantage  of  making
              controls less responsive. The default is OFF (-nosteadykey).

       <b>-[no]ui_active</b>
              Enable  MAME  user  interface  on  top  of  emulated keyboard (if present).  User interface may be
              toggled  during  execution  by  pressing  the  key  defined  with  -ui_modekey.   Default  is  OFF
              (-noui_active).

       <b>-[no]offscreen_reload,</b> <b>-[no]reload</b>
              Controls  whether  or not MAME treats a second button input from a lightgun as a reload signal. In
              this case, MAME will report the gun's  position  as  (0,MAX)  with  the  trigger  held,  which  is
              equivalent  to  an  offscreen  reload.  This  is  only needed for games that required you to shoot
              offscreen to reload, and then only if your gun does not support off screen reloads. The default is
              OFF (-nooffscreen_reload).

       <b>-joystick_map,</b> <b>-joymap</b> <u>map</u>
              Controls how joystick values map to digital joystick controls.  See /usr/share/doc/mame/config.txt
              for full details on <u>map</u> format.

       <b>-joystick_deadzone,</b> <b>-joy_deadzone,</b> <b>-jdz</b> <u>value</u>
              If you play with an analog joystick, the center can drift a little.  joystick_deadzone  tells  how
              far  along  an axis you must move before the axis starts to change. This option expects a float in
              the range of 0.0 to 1.0. Where 0 is the center of the joystick and  1  is  the  outer  limit.  The
              default is 0.3.

       <b>-joystick_saturation,</b> <b>-joy_saturation,</b> <b>-jsat</b> <u>value</u>
              If  you  play  with  an analog joystick, the ends can drift a little, and may not match in the +/-
              directions. joystick_saturation tells how far along an  axis  movement  change  will  be  accepted
              before it reaches the maximum range. This option expects a float in the range of 0.0 to 1.0, where
              0 is the center of the joystick and 1 is the outer limit.  The default is 0.85.

       <b>-[no]natural,</b> <b>-[no]nat</b>
              Allows  user  to  specify whether or not to use a natural keyboard.  This allows you to start your
              game or system  in  a  'native'  mode,  depending  on  your  region,  allowing  compatibility  for
              non-"QWERTY" style keyboards.  The default is OFF (-nonatural).

       <b>-[no]joystick_contradictory,</b> <b>-[no]joy_contradictory</b>
              Enable  contradictory  direction  digital  joystick  input  at  the  same  time.   Default  is OFF
              (-nojoystick_contradictory).

       <b>-coin_impulse</b> <u>time</u>
              Set coin impulse time. A negative value for <u>time</u> disables the impulse;  set  <u>time</u>  to  0  to  obey
              driver or give a positive value to set impulse time.

       <b>-uimodekey,</b> <b>-umk</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies the key used to toggle between full and partial UI mode.

       <b>-uifontprovider</b> <u>auto</u>|<u>sdl</u>|<u>none</u>
              Provider for ui font.

       <b>-output</b> <u>console</u>|<u>network</u>|<u>none</u>
              Provider for output.

       <b>-keyboardprovider</b> <u>auto</u>|<u>sdl</u>|<u>none</u>
              Provider for keyboard input.

       <b>-mouseprovider</b> <u>auto</u>|<u>sdl</u>|<u>none</u>
              Provider for mouse input.

       <b>-lightgunprovider</b> <u>auto</u>|<u>none</u>
              Provider for lightgun input.

       <b>-joystickprovider</b> <u>auto</u>|<u>sdl</u>|<u>none</u>
              Provider for joystick input.

       <b>-[no]keymap</b>
              Enable  keymap  for  non-QWERTY  keyboards.  Used in conjunction with <b>-keymap_file</b>. Default is OFF
              (-nokeymap).

       <b>-keymap_file</b> <u>keymap_file</u>
              Specifies the full path to the keymap file to be  used.  A  few  keymap  files  are  available  in
              <b>/usr/share/games/mess/keymaps</b>.

       <b>-joy_idx[0-8]</b> <u>joystick</u>
              With  these options you can assign a joystick to a specific index in MAME. Even if the kernel will
              list the joysticks in a different order on the next boot, MAME will still see the joystick as e.g.
              "Joystick 2". Use mame -v to see which joysticks are recognized.  Default is 'auto'.

       <b>-[no]sixaxis</b>
              Use special handling for PS3 Sixaxis controllers.  Default is OFF (-nosixaxis).

       <b>-mouse_index[1-8]</b>
              Map mouse to specific index in MAME.

       <b>-keyb_idx[0-8]</b> <u>keyboard</u>
              With these options you can assign a keyboard to a specific index in MAME.

       <b>-videodriver,</b> <b>-vd</b> <u>auto</u>|<u>x11</u>|<u>directfb</u>
              SDL video driver to use; 'auto' selects SDL default.

       <b>-mouse_device</b> [<u>none</u>|<u>keyboard</u>|<u>mouse</u>|<u>lightgun</u>|<u>joystick</u>]
              Each of these options controls automatically enabling the mouse,  or  joystick  depending  on  the
              presence  of  a  particular  class  of  analog  control for a particular game. For example, if you
              specify the option -paddle mouse, then any game that  has  a  paddle  control  will  automatically
              enable  mouse  controls  just as if you had explicitly specified -mouse.  Note that these controls
              override the values of -[no]mouse, -[no]joystick, etc.

   <b>Debugging</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-[no]log</b>
              Creates a file called error.log which contains all of the internal log messages generated  by  the
