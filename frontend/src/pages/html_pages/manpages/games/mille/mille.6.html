</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mille - play Mille Bornes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mille</b> [ file ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Mille</u>  plays  a  two-handed  game reminiscent of the Parker Brother's game of Mille Bornes with you.  The
       rules are described below.  If a file name is given on the command line, the game saved in that  file  is
       started.

       When a game is started up, the bottom of the score window will contain a list of commands.  They are:

       P      Pick a card from the deck.  This card is placed in the `P' slot in your hand.

       D      Discard  a  card  from your hand.  To indicate which card, type the number of the card in the hand
              (or “P” for the just-picked card) followed by a RETURN or SPACE.  The RETURN or SPACE is  required
              to allow recovery from typos which can be very expensive, like discarding safeties.

       U      Use a card.  The card is again indicated by its number, followed by a RETURN or SPACE.

       O      Toggle  ordering  the  hand.   By  default  off,  if turned on it will sort the cards in your hand
              appropriately.  This is not recommended for the impatient on slow terminals.

       Q      Quit the game.  This will ask for confirmation, just to be sure.  Hitting DELETE  (or  RUBOUT)  is
              equivalent.

       S      Save the game in a file.  If the game was started from a file, you will be given an opportunity to
              save  it  on  the  same file.  If you don't wish to, or you did not start from a file, you will be
              asked for the file name.  If you type a RETURN without a name, the save will be terminated and the
              game resumed.

       R      Redraw the screen from scratch.  The command ^L (control `L') will also work.

       W      Toggle window type.  This switches the score window between  the  startup  window  (with  all  the
              command names) and the end-of-game window.  Using the end-of-game window saves time by eliminating
              the  switch  at  the  end  of the game to show the final score.  Recommended for hackers and other
              miscreants.

       If you make a mistake, an error message will be printed on the last line of the score window, and a  bell
       will beep.

       At  the end of each hand or game, you will be asked if you wish to play another.  If not, it will ask you
       if you want to save the game.  If you do, and the save is unsuccessful, play will be resumed  as  if  you
       had  said  you wanted to play another hand/game.  This allows you to use the “<b>S</b>” command to reattempt the
       save.

</pre><h4><b>RULES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Object</b>: The point of this game is to get a total of 5000 points in several hands.  Each hand is a race to
       put  down  exactly  700  miles  before  your  opponent  does.   Beyond  the points gained by putting down
       milestones, there are several other ways of making points.

       <b>Overview</b>: The game is played with a deck of 101 cards.   <u>Distance</u>  cards  represent  a  number  of  miles
       traveled.  They come in denominations of 25, 50, 75, 100, and 200.  When one is played, it adds that many
       miles to the player's trip so far this hand.  <u>Hazard</u> cards are used to prevent your opponent from putting
       down  Distance  cards.  They can only be played if your opponent has a <u>Go</u> card on top of the Battle pile.
       The cards are <u>Out</u> <u>of</u> <u>Gas</u>, <u>Accident</u>, <u>Flat</u> <u>Tire</u>, <u>Speed</u> <u>Limit</u>, and <u>Stop</u>.  <u>Remedy</u> cards fix  problems  caused
       by  Hazard  cards  played  on  you by your opponent.  The cards are <u>Gasoline</u>, <u>Repairs</u>, <u>Spare</u> <u>Tire</u>, <u>End</u> <u>of</u>
       <u>Limit</u>, and <u>Go</u>.  <u>Safety</u> cards prevent your opponent from putting specific Hazard cards on you in the first
       place.  They are <u>Extra</u> <u>Tank</u>, <u>Driving</u> <u>Ace</u>, <u>Puncture</u> <u>Proof</u>, and <u>Right</u> <u>of</u> <u>Way</u>, and there  are  only  one  of
       each in the deck.

       <b>Board</b>  <b>Layout</b>:  The  board  is  split  into  several  areas.   From  top to bottom, they are: <b>SAFETY</b> <b>AREA</b>
       (unlabeled): This is where the safeties will be placed as they are played.  <b>HAND</b>: These are the cards  in
       your hand.  <b>BATTLE</b>: This is the Battle pile.  All the Hazard and Remedy Cards are played here, except the
       <u>Speed</u>  <u>Limit</u>  and  <u>End</u>  <u>of</u> <u>Limit</u> cards.  Only the top card is displayed, as it is the only effective one.
       <b>SPEED</b>: The Speed pile.  The <u>Speed</u> <u>Limit</u> and <u>End</u> <u>of</u> <u>Limit</u> cards are played here to control  the  speed  at
       which the player is allowed to put down miles.  <b>MILEAGE</b>: Miles are placed here.  The total of the numbers
       shown here is the distance traveled so far.

       <b>Play</b>:  The  first pick alternates between the two players.  Each turn usually starts with a pick from the
       deck.  The player then plays a card, or if this is not possible or desirable, discards one.  Normally,  a
       play  or  discard of a single card constitutes a turn.  If the card played is a safety, however, the same
       player takes another turn immediately.

       This repeats until one of the players reaches 700 points or the deck runs out.  If someone  reaches  700,
       they have the option of going for an <u>Extension</u>, which means that the play continues until someone reaches
       1000 miles.

       <b>Hazard</b> <b>and</b> <b>Remedy</b> <b>Cards</b>: Hazard Cards are played on your opponent's Battle and Speed piles.  Remedy Cards
       are used for undoing the effects of your opponent's nastiness.

           <b>Go</b>  (Green  Light)  must  be the top card on your Battle pile for you to play any mileage, unless you
       have played the <u>Right</u> <u>of</u> <u>Way</u> card (see below).
           <b>Stop</b> is played on your opponent's <u>Go</u> card to prevent them from playing mileage until they play  a  <u>Go</u>
       card.
           <b>Speed</b>  <b>Limit</b>  is played on your opponent's Speed pile.  Until they play an <u>End</u> <u>of</u> <u>Limit</u> they can only
       play 25 or 50 mile cards, presuming their <u>Go</u> card allows them to do even that.
           <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>Limit</b> is played on your Speed pile to nullify a <u>Speed</u> <u>Limit</u> played by your opponent.
           <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gas</b> is played on your opponent's <u>Go</u> card.  They must then play a <u>Gasoline</u> card, and then a  <u>Go</u>
       card before they can play any more mileage.
           <b>Flat</b> <b>Tire</b> is played on your opponent's <u>Go</u> card.  They must then play a <u>Spare</u> <u>Tire</u> card, and then a <u>Go</u>
       card before they can play any more mileage.
           <b>Accident</b>  is  played  on  your opponent's <u>Go</u> card.  They must then play a <u>Repairs</u> card, and then a <u>Go</u>
       card before they can play any more mileage.

       <b>Safety</b> <b>Cards</b>: Safety cards prevent your opponent from playing the corresponding Hazard cards on  you  for
       the rest of the hand.  It cancels an attack in progress, and <u>always</u> <u>entitles</u> <u>the</u> <u>player</u> <u>to</u> <u>an</u> <u>extra</u> <u>turn</u>.
           <b>Right</b>  <b>of</b>  <b>Way</b>  prevents  your opponent from playing both <u>Stop</u> and <u>Speed</u> <u>Limit</u> cards on you.  It also
       acts as a permanent <u>Go</u> card for the rest of the hand, so you can play mileage as long as there is  not  a
       Hazard  card on top of your Battle pile.  In this case only, your opponent can play Hazard cards directly
       on a Remedy card other than a Go card.
           <b>Extra</b> <b>Tank</b> When played, your opponent cannot play an <u>Out</u> <u>of</u> <u>Gas</u> on your Battle Pile.
           <b>Puncture</b> <b>Proof</b> When played, your opponent cannot play a <u>Flat</u> <u>Tire</u> on your Battle Pile.
           <b>Driving</b> <b>Ace</b> When played, your opponent cannot play an <u>Accident</u> on your Battle Pile.

       <b>Distance</b> <b>Cards</b>: Distance cards are played when you have a <u>Go</u> card on your Battle pile, or a Right of  Way
       in  your  Safety  area  and are not stopped by a Hazard Card.  They can be played in any combination that
       totals exactly 700 miles, except that <u>you</u> <u>cannot</u> <u>play</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>two</u> <u>200</u> <u>mile</u> <u>cards</u> <u>in</u> <u>one</u> <u>hand</u>.   A  hand
       ends whenever one player gets exactly 700 miles or the deck runs out.  In that case, play continues until
       neither someone reaches 700, or neither player can use any cards in their hand.  If the trip is completed
       after the deck runs out, this is called <u>Delayed</u> <u>Action</u>.

       <b>Coup</b>  <b>Fourr´e</b>: This is a French fencing term for a counter-thrust move as part of a parry to an opponent's
       attack.  In current French colloquial language it means a sneaky, underhanded blow.  In Mille Bornes,  it
       is  used  as  follows:  If an opponent plays a Hazard card, and you have the corresponding Safety in your
       hand, you play it immediately, even <u>before</u> you draw.  This immediately removes the Hazard card from  your
       Battle  pile,  and protects you from that card for the rest of the game.  This gives you more points (see
       “Scoring” below).

       <b>Scoring</b>: Scores are totaled at the end of each hand, whether or not anyone completed the trip.  The terms
       used in the Score window have the following meanings:
           <b>Milestones</b> <b>Played</b>: Each player scores as many miles as they played before the trip ended.
           <b>Each</b> <b>Safety</b>: 100 points for each safety in the Safety area.
           <b>All</b> <b>4</b> <b>Safeties</b>: 300 points if all four safeties are played.
