</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bouncy - game for kids

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bouncy</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You  play  Bouncy the Hungry Rabbit. You're in a garden with yummy veggies and a farmer who's not keen on
       you eating them. You can hide (and move around) under the ground.

       Bouncy was written so it could be enjoyed by the author's daughter, who was about to turn 3, and by older
       gamers. Hence it's not a violent game and "easy" is really, really easy, and "hard" is challenging.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       You are a hungry rabbit. Your mission is to eat food to complete the level.

       CONTROLS:
         arrows   - move around
         "e"      - eat whatever is in front of you
         "d"      - dig into the ground (hold to go underground)
                    also, when underground, "d"ig to surface
         escape   - quit

       Dig for long enough and you'll go into the hole. Move around under ground - fences no longer stop you and
       the farmer can't see you. Hold "d" again to surface.
