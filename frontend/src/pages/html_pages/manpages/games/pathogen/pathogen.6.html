</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pathogen - Puzzle game about matching 3D model structures

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pathogen</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  documents  briefly the <b>pathogen</b> command.  This manual page was written for the Debian
       distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       <b>Pathogen</b> <b>Warrior</b> is a puzzle game about matching 3D model structures with a 2D hexagon map. It was one of
       the entrants to the 4th Ludum Dare 48-hour game development competition. The theme of the competition was
       "Infection". In Pathogen Warrior, the player's task is to match rotating 3D pathogen structures with a 2D
       model using a hexagon map. The time to accomplish the task is limited, and after successfully  completing
       one pathogen, the player is advanced to next level, which has a more challenging pathogen.
