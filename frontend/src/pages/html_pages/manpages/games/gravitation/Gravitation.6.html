</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gravitation - a game about mania, melancholia, and the creative process.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gravitation</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Gravitation  is  a  video  game  written  by  Jason Rohrer about the creative process and the interaction
       between the creative process and life.

       Gravitation is an art game. As a result, some people love it and some people hate it. Check out the links
       to places it has been discussed on the website for some of the reactions.

       The mechanics of the game are fairly simple. Your "score" is related to  the  amount  of  "projects"  you
       complete.  To  complete a project, first you need to discover and idea. In the game ideas are represented
       by blue stars and located in the maze above your initial position.  To get to the maze,  you  can  either
       wait  till  you  feel  inspired to jump that far, or you can play with your daughter and be inspired more
       quickly. Once you find an idea, it will fall to earth (so to speak), and you now need to  "complete"  the
       project  by  pushing  the fallen star (now a white cube) into the fireplace. The game mechanics allow for
       myriad situations and exploring them can be an interesting experience.

       The most interesting part about this game is the emotions it evokes within the player of  the  game.  The
       ultra-low-res  pixel  art  helps here, by not being too distracting and by leaving plenty room for viewer
       interpretation.

       Gravitation is the follow-up to Passage, another art game by Jason Rohrer.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Gravitation has no command-line options.

       The left and right arrow keys move left and right.

       The spacebar is used to jump. Hold for higher jumps.

       The Esc key is used to quit the game.

       The  game  resolution  and  use  of  fullscreen  or  a  window  can  be  set  by  editing  the  files  in
       /etc/gravitation.
