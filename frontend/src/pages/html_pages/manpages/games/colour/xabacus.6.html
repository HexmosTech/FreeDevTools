</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is an implementation of the classic Chinese Abacus (Suanpan) which  has  its  origins  in  the  12th
       century.

       The  device  has  two  decks.   Each  deck,  separated by a partition, normally has 13 rails on which are
       mounted beads.  Each rail on the top deck contains 1 or 2 beads, and each rod on the bottom deck contains
       4 or 5 beads.  Each bead on the upper deck has a value of five, while each bead on  the  lower  deck  has
       value  of one.  Beads are considered counted, when moved <u>towards</u> the partition separating the decks, i.e.
       to add a value of one, a bead in the bottom deck is moved up, and to add a value of 5, a bead in the  top
       deck is moved down.

       The  basic operations of the abacus are addition and subtraction.  Multiplication can be done by mentally
       multiplying the digits and adding up the intermediate results on the abacus.  Division would  be  similar
       where the intermediate results are subtracted.  There are techniques like using your thumb and forefinger
       which  does  not  apply  with  mouse  entry.  Also with multiplication, one can carry out calculations on
       different parts of the abacus for scratch work, here it is nice to have a long abacus.

       The pre-WWII Japanese Abacus (Soroban) (or Korean Jupan) is similar to the Chinese Abacus  but  has  only
       one bead per rail on the top deck.  The later Japanese Abacus was further simplified to have only 4 beads
       per rail on the bottom deck.

       The  Roman  Hand-Abacus predates the Chinese Abacus and is very similar to the later Japanese Abacus, but
       seems to have fallen out of use with the Fall of the Roman Empire (at least 3  are  in  existence).   The
       Roman  Abaci  are  brass  plates  where  the beads move in slots.  In addition to the normal 7 columns of
       beads, they generally have 2 special columns on the right side.   In  two  examples:  the  first  special
       column was for 12ths (12 uncia (ounces) = 1 as) and had one extra bead in the bottom deck.  Also the last
       column  was  a combination of halves, quarters, and twelfths of an ounce and had no beads in the top deck
       and 4 beads at the bottom (beads did not have to come to the top to be counted but at  one  of  3  marked
       points  where  the  top  bead  was  for  halves,  the  next bead for quarters, and the last two beads for
       twelfths).  In another surviving example: the 2 special columns were switched and the combination  column
       was broken into 3 separate slots.  If available, decimal input is ignored.

       The Russian Abacus was invented in the 17th century, here the beads are moved from right to left.  It has
       colored  beads  in  the  middle  for  ease  of  use.   Quarters represent 1/4 Rubles and are only present
       historically on the Russian Abacus (Schoty).  Some of the older Schoty have a extra  place  for  the  1/4
       Kopek (quarter percent) as well as the 1/4 Ruble (quarter).

       The Danish Abacus was used in the early 20th century in elementary schools as a teaching aid.

       The  Medieval  Counter is a primitive form of the abacus and was used in Europe as late as the 1600s.  It
       was useful considering they were using it with Roman Numerals.   This is similar  to  the  Salamis  Greek
       Tablet from 4th or 5th Century BCE.

       The  Mesoamerican  Nepohualtzintzin is a Japanese Abacus base 20.  The Mesoamericans had base 20 with the
       exception of the 3rd decimal place where instead of 20*20=400 the third place  marked  360  and  the  4th
       place  was  20*360,  etc..   They  independently  created  their  own  zero  (only the Sumerian and early
       Babylonian culture (base 60) and India (base 10) have done this) but  the  anomaly  took  away  its  true
       power.

       An  easy way of figuring out time in seconds given hours, minutes, and seconds, can be done on the abacus
       with Sumerian abacus with topFactor 10, topNumber 5 and bottomNumber 9 using base 60.  No written  record
       of such a device exits but its plausible that one did.

       The Chinese Solid-and-Broken-Bar System is a base 12 numbering system and not really an abacus.  When the
       abacus  is  setup in this way though (topFactor 3, topNumber 3, bottomNumber 2, base 12, displayBase 12),
       it is easy to relate the two.

       The signed bead is an invention of the author, and is not  present  on  any  historical  abacus  (to  his
       knowledge)  and  is used to represent negatives.  "New &amp; Improved" abacus models have two auxiliary decks
       stacked above the principal  deck  that  enable  multiplication,  division,  square-root,  and  cube-root
       computations to be performed with equal ease as addition and subtraction  (well, so I have read).

</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       Click "<b>mouse-left</b>" button on a bead you want to move.  The beads will shift themselves to vacate the area
       of the column that was clicked.

       Click "<b>mouse-right</b>" button, or press "<b>C</b>" or "<b>c</b>" keys, to clear the abacus.

       Press "<b>-</b>" or "<b>_</b>" keys to complement the beads on the rails.

       Press "<b>U</b>" or "<b>u</b>" keys to undo last move.

       Press "<b>R</b>" or "<b>r</b>" keys to redo the last undo.

       Press "<b>I</b>" or "<b>i</b>" keys to increment the number of rails.  Press "<b>D</b>" or "<b>d</b>" keys to decrement the number of
       rails.

       Press  "<b>F</b>"  or "<b>f</b>" keys to switch between Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Danish, Roman, and Medieval
       formats.  There is an extra "Generic" format, this allows one to  break  some  rules  binding  the  other
       formats  (for  example,  if  one wanted more beads on top deck than on bottom deck you would use this, in
       addition to resource option changes).

       Press "<b>V</b>" or "<b>v</b>" keys to change the Roman Nvmerals format. (Pardon typo/humor, but ran out of letters).

       Press "<b>~</b>" key to toggle Latin Numerals (when Roman Nvmerals  and  quarter  beads  or  twelfth  beads  are
       activated).

       Press "<b>G</b>" or "<b>g</b>" keys to toggle (usu.) commas between groups of digits.

       Press "<b>#</b>" key to toggle place on rail (or between rails) for group and decimal separators.

       Press "<b>|</b>" key to toggle vertical placement (best for Russian and Danish Abacus, and Medieval Counters).

       Press "<b>S</b>" or "<b>s</b>" keys to toggle the sign bead.

       Press  "<b>P</b>"  or  "<b>p</b>"  keys to change the piece setting from none|quarter|eighth|twelfth beads.  Originally
       intended for the Roman Hand Abacus (twelfths) and the Russian Abacus (quarter rubles).

       Press "<b>T</b>" or "<b>t</b>" keys to change piece percent setting for none|quarter|eighth|twelfth beads.   Originally
       intended for the older Russian Abacus (quarter kopeks).

       Press  "<b>B</b>" or "<b>b</b>" keys to change subdeck setting to be interpretted as none|quarter|eighth|twelfth beads.
       Originally intended for Roman Hand Abacus twelfths and possibly eighths.  For twelfths,  the  the  lowest
       value  of  two  at bottom of the rightmost column of beads are a twelfth of the column second from right.
       Middle is worth a quarter and the top is worth a half.  For eighths, middle and bottom are both worth  an
       eight and the top a half.  (For quarters, all are worth a quarter.)

       Press "<b>K</b>" or "<b>k</b>" to toggle the subdeck separation

       Press "<b>L</b>" or "<b>l</b>" to toggle which side the subdeck symbols are placed.

       Press "<b>M</b>" or "<b>m</b>" keys to switch between it, uk, and fr museum formats.

       Press "<b>Z</b>" or "<b>z</b>" keys to change the Roman markerz on the frame.

       Press "<b>O</b>" or "<b>o</b>" keys to toggle the demo mode.

       Press "<b>$</b>" key to toggle the teach mode.

       In teach mode, "<b>+</b>" key toggles starting side to sum, "<b>"*</b>" key toggles for starting side for multiplicand.

       Press  "<b>&gt;</b>"  or  "<b>.</b>"  keys  to  speed  up  the movement of beads.  Press "<b>&lt;</b>" or "<b>,</b>" keys to slow down this
       movement.

       Press "<b>@</b>" key to toggle the sound.

       Press "<b>Esc</b>" key to hide program.

       Press "<b>Q</b>", "<b>q</b>", or "<b>CTRL-C</b>" keys to kill program.

       The abacus may be resized.  Beads will reshape depending on the room they have.  <u>Demo</u> <u>Mode:</u> In this mode,
       the abacus is controlled by the program.  When started with the demo option, a second window is presented
       that should be placed directly below the abacus-window. Descriptive text, and user prompts are  displayed
       in  this  window.   Pressing  'q'  during the demo will quit it.  Clicking the left mouse-button with the
       pointer in the window will restart the demo (beginning of current lesson).

               subtracted,  and  the number of text lines (4).  This can be edited to add text to the lesson and
               used as a new demo keeping the generated numbers and the  number  of  lines  constant.   (Windows
               version writes to abacus.xml.)

       <b>-[no]demo</b>
               This option specifies to run in demo mode.  In this mode, the abacus is controlled by the current
               lesson  (resource name "<u>demo</u>").  When started with the demo option, a window contains descriptive
               text, and user prompts are displayed in this window.  Pressing 'q' during the demo will quit  it.
               Clicking the left mouse-button with the pointer in the window will restart the demo (beginning of
               current  lesson).   The  demo  uses  abacusDemo.xml  and  currently there are 4 editions possible
               (Chinese, Japanese (and Roman), Korean, and Russian (and Danish)).

       <b>-demopath</b> <u>path</u>
               This   option    specifies    the    path    for    the    demo,    possibly    something    like
               /usr/local/share/games/xabacus  (resource name "<u>demoPath</u>"), with the file name of abacusDemo.xml.
               For this to work, the program must be compiled with XML2 or else will use a brief static fallback
               demo.

       <b>-demofont</b> <u>fontstring</u>
               This option specifies the font for the explanatory text that appears  in  the  secondary  window,
               during  the  demo.   The  default  font  is  18 point Times-Roman (-*-times-*-r-*-*-*-180-*). The
               alternate font is 8x13.

       <b>-demofg</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the foreground of the abacus demo window (resource name "<u>demoForeground</u>").

       <b>-demobg</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the background of the abacus demo window (resource name "<u>demoBackground</u>").

       <b>-[no]teach</b>
               This option specifies to run in teach mode.  In this mode, the abacus is controlled by 2  numbers
               separated by an operator: "+" for addition, "-" for subtraction, "*" for multiplication, and  "/"
               for  division.  The square root operation is represented by the number to be operated on followed
               by the character "v" (this leaves  you  with  an  answer  from  which  you  must  divide  by  2).
               Similarly, the cube root operation is represented by the number to be operated on followed by the
               character "u" (this leaves you with an answer from which you must divide by 3).  Press return key
               to progress through the steps (resource name "<u>teach</u>").

       <b>-[no]rightToLeftAdd</b>
               This  option  specifies  the  order  for  teach  starting side for addition and subtraction.  The
               default is the traditional left to right.  Right to  left  seems  easier  though  (resource  name
               "<u>rightToLeftAdd</u>").

       <b>-[no]rightToLeftMult</b>
               This  option  specifies the order for teach starting side for multiplication.  The default is the
               traditional  left  to  right.   Right  to  left  seems  more  straight  forward  (resource   name
               "<u>rightToLeftMult</u>").

       <b>-[no]lee</b>
               This option allows you to turn on and off the two extra auxiliary abaci (resource name "<u>lee</u>").

       <b>-rails</b> <u>int</u>
               This option specifies the number of rails (resource name "<u>rails</u>").

       <b>-leftAuxRails</b> <u>int</u>
               This  option  allows  you  to  set the number of the rails for the left auxiliary abacus in Lee's
               Abacus (resource name "<u>leftAuxRails</u>").

       <b>-rightAuxRails</b> <u>int</u>
               This option allows you to set the number of the rails for the right  auxiliary  abacus  in  Lee's
               Abacus (resource name "<u>rightAuxRails</u>").

       <b>-[no]vertical</b>
               This  option  allows  you  to  set  the  abacus  to  allow  a  Russian orientation (resource name
               "<u>vertical</u>").

       <b>-colorScheme</b> <u>int</u>
               This option specifies the color scheme for the abacus (resource  name  "<u>colorScheme</u>")  where  0-&gt;
               none,  1-&gt;  darken  middle  bead  (2  beads  if even), 2-&gt; darken  first bead of a group, 4-&gt; use
               secondary color for second half of a row of beads  (but  if  odd  color  middle  bead),  8-&gt;  use
               secondary color for second third of a row of beads, 16-&gt; use secondary color in alternate groups.
               Use a mask of 31 for combinations.

       <b>-[no]slot</b>
               This option allows you to have either slots or rails (resource name "<u>slot</u>").

       <b>-[no]placeOnRail</b>
               This  option  allows  you  to  place  the  decimal  and  group separators on rail (or just after)
               (resource name "<u>placeOnRail</u>").

       <b>-[no]decimalComma</b>
               This option allows you to swap "." for "," to allow for different display format  (resource  name
               "<u>decimalComma</u>").

       <b>-base</b> <u>int</u>
               This option specifies the base used on abacus (default is base 10) (resource name "<u>base</u>").

       <b>-subbase</b> <u>int</u>
               This  option  specifies  the base for the Roman subdeck, can set to 8 or default of 12) (resource
               name "<u>subbase</u>").

               This option allows you to have the subdecks separated (resource name "<u>subdecksSeparated</u>").

       <b>-[no]subdecksSeparated</b>
               This option allows you to have the subdecks separated (resource name "<u>placeOnRail</u>").

       <b>-anomaly</b> <u>int</u>
               This option specifies the offset from the base for a multiplicative factor of the rail  with  the
               anomaly (if none, this is set to 0) (resource name "<u>anomaly</u>").

       <b>-shiftAnomaly</b> <u>int</u>
               This  option  specifies  the offset from decimal point for the anomaly (usually 2) (resource name

       <b>-displayBase</b> <u>int</u>
               This option specifies the base displayed (default is base 10) (resource name "<u>displayBase</u>").   If
               this  is  different  then  "<u>base</u>" then it is implemented using "long long" and the calculation is
               limited by its bounds.  Also the fractional part does not scale with the "<u>displayBase</u>" so if  the
               "<u>displayBase</u>" is greater than the "<u>base</u>" it looses some precision.  Also no rounding is done.

       <b>-[no]pressOffset</b>
               This  option  allows you to put a pixel space between all the beads so there is room for the bead
               to move when pressed (resource name "<u>pressOffset</u>").

       <b>-romanNumerals</b> <b>{none|ancient|modern}</b>
               This option allows you to set the abacus to allow Roman Numerals (resource name "<u>romanNumerals</u>").
               Modern Roman Numerals above 3999 are  normally  represented  with  bars  on  top,  due  to  ASCII
               constraints  this  is  represented  instead in lower case (historically case was ignored).  Roman
               Numerals  above  3,999,999  were  not  represented  historically.   Roman  numerals  change  with
               displayBase  in  an  "experimental"  way.   When  used with twelfths and subdecks, named fraction
               symbols are used.  Due to ASCII constraints the sigma is represented as E,  the  backwards  C  is
               represented  as  a Q, the mu as a u, and the Z with a - through the center as a z.  If available,
               decimal input is ignored.

       <b>-[no]latin</b>
               This option allows you to set the abacus to allow latin fractions  instead  of  symbolic  in  the
               Roman numeral output (resource name "<u>latin</u>").

       <b>-romanMarkers</b> <b>{none|ancient|modern|late|alt}</b>
               This  option  allows  you  to  set  Roman  numerals of a specific type on the frame of the abacus
               (resource name "<u>modernRoman</u>").

       <b>-chinese</b>
               This option specifies the format on the abacus (resource name  "<u>format</u>")  to  "Chinese"  for  the
               Chinese Suanpan.

       <b>-japanese</b>
               This  option  specifies  the  format on the abacus (resource name "<u>format</u>") to "Japanese" for the
               Japanese post-WWII Soroban.  This is also similar to the Roman Hand Abacus.

       <b>-korean</b> This option specifies the format on the abacus (resource  name  "<u>format</u>")  to  "Korean"  for  the
               Korean Jupan or Japanese pre-WWII Soroban.

       <b>-russian</b>
               This  option  specifies  the  format  on the abacus (resource name "<u>format</u>") to "Russian" for the
               Russian Schoty.  To complete, specify  <u>piece</u>"  to  be  4,  for  the  older  Schoty  also  specify
               <u>piecePercent</u>" to be 4.

       <b>-danish</b> This  option  specifies  the  format  of  the abacus (resource name "<u>format</u>") to "Danish" for the
               Danish Elementary School Abacus teaching aid.

       <b>-roman</b>  This option specifies the format on the abacus (resource name "<u>format</u>") to "Roman" for the  Roman
               Hand Abacus, note beads move in slots.  To complete, specify <u>romanNumerals</u>".

       <b>-medieval</b>
               This  option  specifies  the  format of the abacus (resource name "<u>format</u>") to "Medieval" for the
               Medieval Counter, with counters instead of beads.

       <b>-generic</b>
               This option specifies the format on the abacus  (resource  name  "<u>format</u>")  to  "Generic".   This
               option specifies a format that is more configurable by using resources, since there are few rules
               to govern its behavior.

       <b>-museum</b> <b>{it|br|fr}</b>
               This option specifies the country code for the museum of the abacus in the Museum of the Thermae,
               Rome, the British Museum, London, or the Cabinet de medailles, Bibliotheque nationale, Paris.

       <b>-version</b>
               This option tells you what version of xabacus you have.
