</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The original puzzle has 9 triangles per face (size = 3) and has period 3 turning (i.e. the face or points
       turn in 120 degree intervals).  The puzzle was designed by Uwe Meffert and called the Pyraminx.  This has
       2^5*3^8*6!/2 or 75,582,720 different combinations.

       Another puzzle Senior Pyraminx 3x3x3 exists only on paper, it has period 2 turning (i.e.  edges turn with
       180  degree  intervals) but the corners would fall off unless it had some tricky mechanism.  (This may be
       the same as the Master Pyraminx which has 446,965,972,992,000 different combinations).

       Another puzzle (which was not widely distributed), the Junior Pyraminx (and similarly the Junior Pyraminx
       Star, a octahedron formed by two tetrahedra, this has 7!*3^6 or 3,674,160 different combinations), has  4
       triangles  (size  =  2)  per  face.   This  puzzle  has  been recently reissued by Meffert as Pyramorphix
       (<a href="http://www.mefferts-puzzles.com">http://www.mefferts-puzzles.com</a>). At the time I designed this computer puzzle thought that it  had  only
       period 2 turning (i.e the edges rotate).  It turns out the puzzle has a period 4 turning (edges turn with
       90  degree  intervals)  which  makes  it  analogous to the 2x2x2 Rubik's cube.  This puzzle makes various
       non-tetrahedral shapes.  The puzzle contained here has no period 4 turning flexibility.

       One is able to simulate Halpern's Tetrahedron or Pyraminx Tetrahedron (period 3 turning and sticky mode).
       Also one is able to simulate one with variant turning (period 2 turning and sticky mode).

</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       Press "<b>mouse-left</b>" button to move a piece.  Release "<b>mouse-left</b>" button on a piece on the same  face  and
       in  the same row (but not an adjacent piece or the move is ambiguous).  The pieces will then turn towards
       where the mouse button was released.

       Click "<b>mouse-center</b>", or press "<b>P</b>" or "<b>p</b>" keys to toggle the practice mode (in practice mode  the  record
       should say "practice").  This is good for learning moves and experimenting.

       Click  "<b>mouse-right</b>", or press "<b>Z</b>" or "<b>z</b>" keys, to randomize the puzzle (this must be done first to set a
       new record).

       Press "<b>G</b>" or "<b>g</b>" keys to read (get) a saved puzzle.

       Press "<b>W</b>" or "<b>w</b>" keys to save (write) a puzzle.

       Press "<b>U</b>" or "<b>u</b>" keys to undo a move.

       Press "<b>R</b>" or "<b>r</b>" keys to redo a move.

       Press "<b>C</b>" or "<b>c</b>" keys to clear the puzzle.

       Press "<b>S</b>" or "<b>s</b>" keys to start auto-solver.  Only works where size &lt; 4 (or sticky mode set) in  Period  2
       mode or size &lt; 5 in Period 3 mode.

       Press  "<b>O</b>"  or  "<b>o</b>"  keys to toggle the orient mode.  One has to orient the faces in orient mode, besides
       getting all the faces to be the same color.  To do this one has to get the lines to be  oriented  in  the
       same  direction,  this  only matters with center pieces, if at all (i.e.  those pieces not on a corner or
       edge).  This does add complexity so there are 2 sets of records.

       Press "<b>2</b>", "<b>3</b>", "<b>B</b>", or "<b>b</b>" keys (not the keypad 2, 3) to change modes to Period 2, Period 3, or Both.

       Press "<b>Y</b>" or "<b>y</b>" keys to toggle sticky mode (increase/decrease is disabled here if sticky mode is on).
       "Sticky" and "Period 2" turning allows only the edges to turn, and the 2 center rows turn together. It is
       as if the middle cut of the three cuts did not exist.
       "Sticky" and "Period 3" turning allows only the faces to turn, it is as if the middle cut  of  the  three
       cuts did not exist.
       Beware, the "Sticky" mode is a hack and much could be done to improve its look.

       Press "<b>I</b>" or "<b>i</b>" keys to increase the number of pieces.

       Press "<b>D</b>" or "<b>d</b>" keys to decrease the number of pieces.

       Press "<b>V</b>" or "<b>v</b>" keys to change the view of the puzzle.

       Press "<b>&gt;</b>" or "<b>.</b>" keys to speed up the movement of pieces.

       Press "<b>&lt;</b>" or "<b>,</b>" keys to slow down the movement of pieces.

       Press "<b>@</b>" key to toggle the sound.

       Press "<b>Esc</b>" key to hide program.

       Press "<b>Q</b>", "<b>q</b>", or "<b>CTRL-C</b>" keys to kill program.

       Use the key pad or arrow keys to move without the mouse.
       Key pad is defined for Pyraminx as:
         /     Counterclockwise

         8 9   Up, Upper Right
         ^
       4&lt;5&gt;6   Left, Clockwise, Right
         v
       1 2     Lower Left, Down

       Use  the shift keys to access "Period 3" turns from "Both" mode, otherwise it assumes "Period 2" turning.
       Faces and points turn in "Period 3" and edges (2 points) turn in "Period 2".

       Use the control key and the left mouse button, keypad, or arrow keys to move the whole tetrahedron.  This
       is not recorded as a turn.

       The title is in the following format (non-motif version):
              xpyraminx.{2|3|both&lt;turning modes&gt;}: {1|2|3|4|5|6|7|sticky&lt;number of pieces per edge&gt;} @  (&lt;Number
              of moves&gt;/{&lt;Record number of moves&gt; &lt;user name&gt;|"NEVER noaccess"|"practice"}) - &lt;Comment&gt;
       If there is no record of the current puzzle, it displays "NEVER noaccess".

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-geometry</b> <b>{+|-}</b><u>X</u><b>{+|-}</b><u>Y</u>
               This option sets the initial position of the pyraminx window (resource name "<u>geometry</u>").

       <b>-display</b> <u>host</u><b>:</b><u>dpy</u>
               This option specifies the X server to contact.

       <b>-[no]mono</b>
               This  option allows you to display the pyraminx window on a color screen as if it were monochrome
               (resource name "<u>mono</u>").

       <b>-[no]{reverse|rv}</b>
               This  option  allows  you  to  see  the  pyraminx  window  in  reverse   video   (resource   name
               "<u>reverseVideo</u>").

       <b>-{foreground|fg}</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the foreground of the pyraminx window (resource name "<u>foreground</u>").

       <b>-{background|bg}</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the background of the pyraminx window (resource name "<u>background</u>").

       <b>-{border|bd}</b> <u>color</u>
               This  option  specifies  the  border  color  of  the pieces in the pyraminx window (resource name
               "<u>borderColor</u>").

       <b>-face{0|1|2|3}</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>color</u><b>&gt;</b>
               This option allows you to change the color of a face (resource name "<u>faceColorN</u>"). In  mono-mode,
               color  is  represented as the first letter of the color name. The faces are ordered top to bottom
               and left to right.  If you has two colors that begin with the same letter you should have one  in
               uppercase and one in lowercase to distinguish them in mono-mode. You can change the colors of the
               faces to make a stupid pyraminx (i.e. all White or in mono-mode all "W").  Unfortunately, it will
               not normally say its solved when its randomized.  This would be cheating.

       <b>-frame</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the color of the frame (resource name "<u>frameColor</u>").

       <b>-delay</b> <u>msecs</u>
               This  option  specifies  the number of milliseconds it takes to move pieces (1-50) (resource name
               "<u>delay</u>").

       <b>-[no]sound</b>
               This option specifies if sliding pieces should make a sound or not (resource name "<u>sound</u>").

       <b>-moveSound</b> <u>filename</u>
               This option specifies the file for the move sound for the twisting of the puzzle  (resource  name
               "<u>moveSound</u>").

       <b>-{font|fn}</b> <b>ontname</b>
               This option specifies the font that will be used (resource name "<u>font</u>").

       <b>-size</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>int</u><b>&gt;</b>
               This option allows you to change the number of pieces on a edge (resource name "<u>size</u>").

       <b>-sticky</b> This option allows you to set the sticky mode (resource name "<u>sticky</u>").

       <b>-mode</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>int</u><b>&gt;</b>
               This option allows you to set the turning mode (resource name "<u>mode</u>").

       <b>-both</b>   This  option  allows  you  to  set  the turning mode to both period 2 and period 3 (resource name
               "<u>mode</u>" set at 4).

       <b>-[no]orient</b>
               This option allows you to access the oriented mode (resource name "<u>orient</u>").

       <b>-[no]practice</b>
               This option allows you to access the practice mode (resource name "<u>practice</u>").

       <b>-userName</b> <u>string</u>
               This option specifies the user name for any records made or else it  will  get  your  login  name
               (resource name "<u>userName</u>").

       <b>-scoreFile</b> <u>filename</u>
               Specify an alternative score file (resource name "<u>scoreFile</u>").

       <b>-scores</b> This option lists all the recorded scores and then exits.

       <b>-version</b>
               This option tells you what version of xpyraminx you have.

</pre><h4><b>RECORDS</b></h4><pre>
       You  must  randomize the puzzle before a record is set, otherwise an assumption of cheating is made if it
       is solved after a get or an auto-solve.

</pre><h4><b>SAVE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here is the format for the xpyraminx configuration, starting position, and the movement  of  its  pieces.
       The  format  is  not  standard.   The  reason for this is that this is simple to produce and the standard
       notation is not easily scalable for variable number of pieces and turning modes.

       Pyraminx with default colors, not randomized:
       0     B     Blue
         1     R   Red
       2     Y     Yellow
         3     G   Green

              size: 1-7 &lt;number of triangles in the same orientation as the face per row&gt;
              mode: 2-4 &lt;period 2 turning, period 3 turning, or both (4)&gt;
              orient: 0-1 &lt;0 false, 1 true; if 1 then lines on pieces to be oriented&gt;
              sticky: 0-1 &lt;0 false, 1 true; if 1 then some pieces move together&gt;
              practice: 0-1 &lt;0 false, 1 true&gt;
              moves: 0-MAXINT &lt;total number of moves&gt;

              startingPosition: &lt;2 dimensional array of face piece position, each face has size *  size  pieces,
              if  orient mode then orientation number follows face number: 0 up, 1 upper right, 2 right, 3 down,
              4 lower left, and 5 left&gt;

       This is then followed by the moves, starting from 1.
              move #: &lt;direction&gt; &lt;control&gt; &lt;face&gt; &lt;position&gt;
       Each turn is with respect to a face and position.
       Position is 0 to size * size - 1.  Position 0 is  the  triangle  furthest  from  the  center,  increasing
       clockwise.
       Direction  is represented 0 up, 1 upper right, 2 right, 3 down, 4 lower left, 5 left, 9 clockwise, and 15
       counterclockwise.
       Control is represented as 0 or 1, 1 if the whole tetrahedron is moved at once  (here  position  does  not
       matter), 0 if not.  The xpyraminx record keeper does not count a control move as a move, but here we do.

       If  you  have a Pyraminx you cannot solve (2x2x2 or 3x3x3), enter it in pyraminx.log file.  Have size = 2
       or 3, mode = 3, orient = 0, practice = 0, randomized = 1, and moves = 0 and the number representation for
       the color of the pieces (usually 0=B, 1=R, 2=Y, 3=G).  Bring up xpyraminx, hit 'g' so it  will  get  your
       configuration and then 's' to solve your pyraminx and then 'w' to write out the steps.  Then examine your
       pyraminx.log file.
