</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pmars - portable corewar system with ICWS'94 extensions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>pmars</u> [ <u>option</u> ...  ] file1 [ <u>file(s)</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>pMARS</u>  (portable  Memory  Array  Redcode Simulator) is a corewar interpreter with multi-platform support.
       <u>pMARS</u> currently runs on UNIX systems, Windows and the Mac.  <u>pMARS</u> implements the ICWS'94 draft  standard,
       but can also be used in ICWS'88 mode. The base system includes a graphical core display for UNIX (curses,
       X-windows)  and  PC/linux (svgalib). A line-oriented debugger is included to help in writing warriors for
       the ICWS'94 draft standard.

       <u>pMARS</u> runs one or more warriors written in <u>Redcode</u> that are provided as  <u>file(s)</u>  on  the  command  line.
       Running  a  single  warrior  is  supported  for debugging. Two warriors are pitted against each other for
       standard play, but up to 36 warriors can be  named  for  "multi-warrior"  core  war.  If  the  warrior(s)
       assemble without error they are loaded into the core array and executed in round-robin mode starting with
       the  first  warrior.   Warrior  1  is loaded starting at core position 0, warrior 2, 3, etc., at either a
       random or fixed position.  For fairness the starting order is rotated after each round.

</pre><h4><b>SCORE</b></h4><pre>
       The score is reported after all rounds have been played. A round ends  when  either  a  single  surviving
       warrior  remains or when a maximum number of cycles has elapsed.  For each round, every surviving warrior
       is awarded points calculated from a score formula (F).  By default, this is (W*W-1)/S,  where  W  is  the
       total  number  of  warriors  participating, S is the number of of survivors, and "/" is integer division.
       Alternative score formulas can be specified with the <u>=</u> option (see below).

       When two warriors battle, the results are reported as wins1, wins2, and ties, where wins1 and  wins2  are
       the  numbers  of  rounds  that each warrior won, and ties are the number of rounds in which both warriors
       lasted until time-out.  The score is then:

               warrior 1:  points = wins1 * F + ties * F
               warrior 2:  points = wins2 * F + ties * F

       F is a score formula containing the W and S parameters.  When more than two warriors (W) participate in a
       game, results are reported as wins[1], wins[2], .., wins[W], losses for each  warrior,  where  the  index
       indicates  the  number  of  warriors  that survived until the end (S parameter in the score formula). The
       total number of points for each warrior is then calculated as:

               points =  sum (S=1..W) (wins[S] * F)

       A few alternative score formulas:
               10
               (W+1)/S
               (x=W-S+1)*(x+1)/2
               (S==3)*5 + (S==2)*3 + (S==1)
               (S == 1)*W + (S != 1)

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Command line options may occur anywhere on the command line. Single-letter options  without  a  parameter
       can  be  combined  as in -fbe. The special argument <u>-</u> (dash) stands for standard input (stdin). It can be
       combined with the <u>-@</u> option (see below) to signify reading options from stdin, or  the  <u>-</u>  can  take  the
       place of a  warrior filename, in which case warrior code starting with a <u>;redcode</u> line and ending with an
       <u>END</u>  statement  is  extracted  from  stdin.  The  <u>END</u>  statement can be omitted if the next <u>;redcode</u> line
       immediately follows the last instruction. Several warriors, each specified by  a  separate  dash  on  the
       command line and bracketed by <u>;redcode/END</u> can be piped into <u>pMARS.</u>  <u>#-</u> (where # is a positive number) is
       a shorthand for writing this number of dashes on the command line.

       <b>-r</b> <b>#</b>   This  options  sets  the number of rounds to play. The default is 1. -r 0 produces assembly output
              (unless -b is specified), but does not execute the warrior(s). A maximum of 32767  rounds  can  be
              specified.

       <b>-s</b> <b>#</b>   The  -s  option specifies the size of core memory in number of instructions.  It defaults to 8000.
              Maximum core size is platform-dependent, but usually at least 65535.

       <b>-c</b> <b>#</b>   -c sets the maximum number of cycles per round.   A  cycle  consists  of  one  execution  of  each
              warrior. A round ends when either a single warrior remains executing or when the maximum number of
              cycles has elapsed.

       <b>-p</b> <b>#</b>   This option sets the maximum number of processes a warrior can run.  The default is 8000.

       <b>-l</b> <b>#</b>   This sets the maximum length of a warrior source file in instructions.  It defaults to 100.

       <b>-d</b> <b>#</b>   This  option  specifies  the  minimum  distance  between the first instruction of each warrior. It
              cannot be smaller than the maximum length (-l option) and defaults to 100 instructions.

       <b>-S</b> <b>#</b>   The -S option sets the size of the P-space to # cells. The default is 1/16th of core size if  core
              size  is  evenly divisible by sixteen, or the next larger divisible fraction. See also the P-SPACE
              section below.

       <b>-R</b> <b>#</b>   The -R option sets the read limit. The read limit must be a factor of core size.  The  default  is
              core size, i.e. no read limit.

       <b>-W</b> <b>#</b>   The -W option sets the write limit. The write limit must be a factor of core size.  The default is
              core size, i.e. no write limit.

       <b>-f</b>     The  -f  option  instructs the loader to use a fixed series of addresses for positioning warriors.
              This is done by initializing the pseudo random number generator with a checksum value derived from
              the source of all warriors.  Thus, initial placements will still be "random" from round to  round,
              but  will  be the same if the same warriors are run again. As a consequence, the result of battles
              run with the -f option  will  show  no  statistical  fluctuations.  This  options  is  useful  for
              validating  ports  of  <u>pMARS</u>  to  new  platforms  and  for providing an absolute, albeit arbitrary
              performance measure for warriors.

       <b>-F</b> <b>#</b>   This option server two purposes. It sets the seed value of the pseudo random number generator, and
              also tells the loader to install warrior 2 at the given address # for round 1. If  the  number  is
              larger  than  the  core  size minus the minimum warrior distance, it will be wrapped around to the
              range of available starting positions.  This option is useful for testing different versions of  a
              warrior  with constant initial placement.  Warrior 1 is always installed at address 0.  The -F and
              -f options are mutually exclusive. If neither  option  is  specified,  the  pseudo  random  number
              generator is initialized with the system time.

       <b>-P</b>     This option makes <u>pMARS</u> use an alternative algorithm for positioning warriors. This algorithm uses
              all  possible  combinations  of starting order and position in a random sequence, and will not use
              the same combination twice unless all the combinations have already been used. If the -r option is
              not given, the number of rounds fought will be the number of all possible combinations.  Trying to
              use this option with more (or less) than two warriors causes an error.

       <b>-e</b>     If this option is specified, the <u>cdb</u> debugger is entered immediately after loading  warriors  into
              core.

       <b>-b</b>     This options runs <u>pMARS</u> in brief output mode. -b suppresses warrior listings after assembly.

       <b>-A</b>     The  -A  option  assembles  the  input  warriors  without running any fights.  Emits ICWS'94 draft
              compliant load files.

       <b>-k</b>     With the -k option, <u>pMARS</u> uses the same output format as the KotH  program.  This  option  enables
              <u>pMARS</u> to work with scripts written for the KotH server.

       <b>-8</b>     This  options  enforces  strict  compliance  with  the  ICWS'88  standard and disables all ICWS'94
              language extensions, which are flagged as syntax errors by  the  assembler.  Since  ICWS'94  is  a
              superset of ICWS'88, this options is not necessary to run ICWS'88 warriors.

       <b>-o</b>     When  this  option  is  given,  <u>pMARS</u>  reports scores in decreasing order rather than in the order
              warriors were named on the command line. This is mostly useful for multi-warrior play.

       <b>-V</b>     The assembler generates verbose output with this option. This is only useful for debugging.

       <b>-v</b>     This option sets the display mode for UNIX and DOS display versions (see APPENDIX).

       <b>-@</b> <b>&lt;fn&gt;</b>
              <u>pMARS</u> continues reading options and filenames from the parameter file <u>&lt;fn&gt;.</u>  If <u>&lt;fn&gt;</u> is a - (dash)
              standard input is parsed. Comments in the parameter file start with a semicolon.

       <b>-=</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              The = (equal) option allows you to specify a custom score formula (see  SCORE).  The  formula  may
              contain  the  standard  arithmetic  and  logical  operators (as in the C language), as well as the
              parameters W (number of warriors participating) and S (number of warriors surviving  this  round).
              You need to enclose the formula string with quotes if it contains spaces or characters interpreted
              by the operating system.

       <b>-Q</b> <b>#</b>   The  "query"  option is intended for use in scripts that run <u>pMARS</u> in batch mode. Depending on the
              number code following <u>-Q,</u> the program returns an informative number as the exit status.  "pmars -Q
              1000" e.g. will cause <u>pMARS</u> to exit with a code that spells out the program version.  More  on  <u>-Q</u>
              arguments and exit codes can be found in the ADDENDUM.

       <b>$</b>      The  $  (dollar)  parameter is not preceded by a dash and cannot be grouped with other options. It
              terminates reading command line parameters and is used in parameter files  or  input  streams  <u>(-@</u>
              <u>fn).</u>   The  <u>$</u>  is necessary if you want to combine two or more of command line parameters, warrior
              code and cdb commands in the same input stream or file. Below an example of such a combined  input
              file:
                  ;Below the command line parameters:
                  -r 10 -beF 1000 2- $
                  ;redcode
                  ;name Imp 1
                  ;assert 1
                  mov 0,1
                  end
                  ;redcode
                  ;name Imp 2
                  ;assert 1
                  mov 0,2
                  mov 0,2
                  end
                  !! cdb commands follow:
                  sk 1000
                  reg
                  quit

</pre><h4><b>X-WINDOWS</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The X-Windows display version of pMARS has these additional command line options:

       <b>-display</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Expects  a  string  specifying the display where the window should appear.  Following X standards,
              this display specification has a format of hostname.domain:display.screen where  the  part  before
              the  colon  is  the standard internet host specification and display and screen are integers.  The
              screen specification can be omitted. For an example, consider you are working  at  an  X  terminal
              named  ncd13.complang.tuwien.ac.at  and  remotely  logged  in at host stud1.tuwien.ac.at where the
              binary of pmars lies, you can use the following command line

         stud1$ pmars -display ncd13.complang.tuwien.ac.at:0 -b aeka.red aeka.red
         and the window will appear at you local screen.

       <b>-geometry</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Lets you specify the initial size and position of the window. The format is widthxheight+x+y where
              width, height, x, y are integers and + may be replaced by -. Either of the two parts (widthxheight
              or +x+y) may be omitted. This overrides the -v  switch  concerning  the  window  geometry.  As  an
              example,  pmars  -geometry  600x400+30+100  ....   will  open a window of 600 by 400 pixels at the
              screen position (30,100).  pmars -geometry 1024x768 ... creates a window of  1024x768  pixels  and
              pmars  -geometry  -20+300  ...  creates  a window with standard size with its left upper corner at
              position (-20,300), i.e. out of the left side of the screen.

       <b>-fn</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              The string following this argument specifies the X font to use. By default,  a  terminal  font  is
              used.  If this font can't be found, "fixed" is used for a font ("fixed" should be present at every
              X installation).  Use the command 'xlsfonts' to get a listing of fonts that can be used at your  X
              server.  'xfontsel'  provides  a  comfortable way to select a font. "fixed" is the fallback if the
              specified font can't be found.  It is strongly recommended to use a fixed pitch font.

       The argument of the <u>-v</u> display option has an additional fourth digit in the  X-Windows  version:  0  (the
       default)  enables the color display, 1 the grayscale, and 2 the black and white display (e.g. -v 1033 for
       the grayscale display).

</pre><h4><b>REDCODE</b></h4><pre>
       <u>pMARS</u>  implements  an  extension  of  the  proposed  ICWS'94  standard.  The  new  instruction  modifiers
       <u>.A,.B,.AB,.F,.X,</u> and <u>.I,</u> the arithmetic instructions <u>MUL,</u> <u>DIV</u> and <u>MOD,</u> as well as post-increment indirect
       (&gt;) are supported.

       Version  0.5  of <u>pMARS</u> adds support for three experimental opcodes that are currently not included in the
       ICWS'94 draft:

       SEQ (Skip if EQual): this is a synonym for CMP and is included mainly for  clarity  (future  versions  of
       <u>pMARS</u> may implement SEQ as a "predefined EQU" rather than a true opcode).

       SNE (Skip if Not Equal): the opposite of SEQ.

       NOP (No OPerations): do nothing.

       Version  0.6  adds three new indirect addressing modes that use the A-field instead of the B-field as the
       pointer for indirection:

       * - indirect using A-field

       { - predrecement indirect using A-field

       } - postincrement indirect using A-field

       The new P-space instructions of version 0.8 are discussed under separate heading below.

       The assembler also supports multi-line <u>EQU</u> statements, a feature not  included  in  the  current  ICWS'94
       draft.  The format for multi-line EQUates is
           &lt;label&gt; EQU &lt;line1&gt;
                   EQU &lt;line2&gt;
                   [...]
                   EQU &lt;lineN&gt;
       &lt;label&gt;  in  the  warrior  source  is  replaced  by  &lt;line1&gt; &lt;newline&gt; &lt;line2&gt; &lt;newline&gt; [....] lineN. In
       contrast to KotH, pmars <u>EQUs</u> substitute arbitrary text, and not just expressions.   <u>EQU</u>  expressions  are
       not implicitly parenthesized.

       <u>pMARS</u>  features  the non-standard <u>FOR</u> text-repetition macro.  This macro repeats the text between <u>FOR</u> and
       <u>ROF</u> a specified number of times:
       &lt;labels&gt; &lt;counter&gt; FOR &lt;times&gt;
                          [..]
                          ROF
       &lt;times&gt; is an expression specifying the number of expansions; it may contain EQUates and labels  as  long
       as they have been defined before the FOR/ROF block.  &lt;counter&gt; is the last label before the FOR word, but
       not necessarily on the same line.  It is expanded to 01, 02, .., &lt;times&gt; in each repetition. The optional
       &lt;labels&gt; label the first instruction after <u>FOR</u> expansion. An example:
               ORG start
       start
       sp      FOR 2
       a&amp;sp        SPL a&amp;sp
                   JMP a&amp;sp
               ROF

       becomes after expansion

       start
       a01     SPL a01
               JMP a01
       a02     SPL a02
               JMP a02
       The  symbol &amp; concatenates 'a' and 01, 02 to form a valid label.  <u>EQU</u> expansion and FOR/ROF processing is
       done in the same pass.  It is therefore possible to write
       dest01  EQU 500
       dest02  EQU 1000
       dest03  EQU 1500

       idx     FOR 3
                   MOV src,dest&amp;idx
                   MOV src+1,dest&amp;idx
               ROF

       src     MOV &lt;-1,&lt;-1
               JMP src,&lt;-2
       Using predefined EQUates (see below) it is possible to define adaptive FOR/ROF blocks. The  next  example
       fills the remainder of the warrior (up to MAXLENGTH lines) with decoy instructions:
           FOR MAXLENGTH-CURLINE
               DAT 1,1
           ROF
       Since  true  logical  expressions have a value of "1" and false expressions a value of "0", you can write
       conditionally assembled code enclosed by FOR/ROF:
           FOR CORESIZE == 8000
           &lt;some code&gt;
           ROF

           FOR CORESIZE != 8000
           &lt;other code&gt;
           ROF
       <u>pMARS</u> uses KotH-style <u>;name</u> and <u>;author</u> comments to describe warriors.  If a line starting with  ;redcode
       is  present,  all  text  preceding  it  is ignored. This makes it possible to run posted warriors without
       removing mail headers and descriptive text.  The <u>;version,</u> <u>;strategy</u> and other comments mentioned in  the
       ICWS'94 draft are currently not used.

       As another "non-standard" extension, the assembler predefines the following run-time variables: CORESIZE,
       MAXPROCESSES,  MAXCYCLES,  MAXLENGTH, MINDISTANCE, PSPACESIZE, READLIMIT, ROUNDS and WRITELIMIT. They can
       be used in your <u>Redcode</u> as though they were defined by EQUs like
           CORESIZE     EQU 55440  ;current value of -s parameter
           MAXPROCESSES EQU 10000  ;current value of -p parameter
           [etc.]
       The run-time variable CURLINE holds the current instruction number offset  from  the  first  instruction.
       WARRIORS is initialized with the number of warriors specified on the command line.

       <u>pMARS</u>  <u>supports</u>  <u>the</u> <u>;assert</u> directive as a way of checking whether a warrior is run under the parameters
       it was designed for. If the expression following <u>;assert</u> evaluates to "0" (false),  assembly  is  aborted
       with an error message. If an <u>;assert</u> is missing, a warning is issued. Examples:
           ;assert CORESIZE == 55440 &amp;&amp; MAXLENGTH &gt;= 200
           ;assert !(CORESIZE % 4)  ; is multiple of 4
           ;assert 1 ; if warrior works under all settings
       The  run-time  variable  VERSION  holds  the current <u>pMARS</u> version (e.g. "60" is v0.6.0) and is useful in
       ;assert expressions.

       With the -8 option, <u>pMARS</u> is fully ICWS'88 compatible, except that a comma is required between  operands.
       Extensions like predefined and multi-line EQUs and FOR/ROF are supported even in ICWS'88 mode.

       A  full  treatment  of  corewar  and  ICWS'94 in particular is beyond the scope of this document. General
       information  about  corewar  as  well  as  the  ICWS'94  draft  is  available  by  anonymous   FTP   from
       https://corewar.co.uk/standards/

</pre><h4><b>P-SPACE</b></h4><pre>
       Originating  from  discussions  on  rec.games.corewar,  P-space  is  an  attempt  at making warriors more
       "intelligent" by giving them a memory.  P-space, short for "private", "permanent" or "priviledged"  space
       is  a  memory area separate from core whose contents is not cleared between rounds. Every warrior has its
       own P-space for gathering information about the opposing warrior, but there is a provision for sharing P-
       space in team play (see below).

       P-space cells contain values in the range 0..CORESIZE-1. The number of P-space cells can be adjusted with
       the -S command line option; by default, P-space size is 1/16th of CORESIZE. This number is  available  to
       warriors  as  the  predefined variable PSPACESIZE.  pMARS updates P-space cell 0 at the beginning of each
       round with the result of the previous round: 0 signifies a loss in the previous round,  a  number  larger
       than  zero means that the warrior survived until the end of the round, the value indicating the number of
       surviving warriors. That is, a value of "1" means that the warrior survived by itself (a "win" in a  two-
       warrior battle), a value of "2" that two warriors lasted until the end (a "tie" in a two warrior battle),
       etc..   In  the  first  round,  P-cell  0 is set to -1 (actually CORESIZE-1) to indicate that there is no
       previous result.

       There are two new instructions for accessing P-space:

       <b>LDP</b>    (Load P-space) loads P-space cell specified by A-value into core at B-address.

       <b>STP</b>    (Store P-space) stores A-value into P-space cell specified by B-value.

       It is important to note that P-space cells are referred to by A/B-values as opposed to A/B-addresses.  As
       an example, "STP #9,#1" stores number 9 in P-cell 1.

       Since  all  P-space access is only via these two instructions, it takes too much time and space to use P-
       space for working variables where they would  be  safe  from  the  opposing  warrior.  P-space  was  made
       deliberately hard to access, unlike a set of general purpose registers.

       P-space  can  also  be  used for communication between warriors belonging to a team in multi-warrior core
       war. To allow communication, P-space has to be declared as "shared". You do this  by  including  the  PIN
       pseudo-opcode in your source:

       <b>PIN</b>    (P-space  Identification  Number)  has  a  single numerical argument. If two or more participating
              warriors have the same PIN argument, they share the same P-space.  If  the  PIN  pseudo-opcode  is
              missing  from  a  warrior's  source,  its  P-space  is  strictly  private. The PIN argument is not
              normalized to [0..CORESIZE-1] before comparison. "PIN 0" and "PIN CORESIZE" are therefore not  the
              same.

       P-cell  #0  holding  the result of the last round is exempt from sharing, i.e.  every warrior has its own
       last round cell even though the rest of its P-space may be shared.

</pre><h4><b>CDB</b> <b>DEBUGGER</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Cdb</u> is a  line-oriented  debugger.  It  is  invoked  either  by  specifying  the  -e  option  (enter  <u>cdb</u>
       immediately),  by  including  debugging  commands  in the warrior source, or by hitting Ctrl-C during the
       simulation.  The debugger is also entered whenever a warrior terminates ("post-mortem") if execution  was
       started  with  the  <u>go</u> command.  <u>cdb</u> is very powerful and has an overwhelming number of commands. You may
       want to start with only the most often used commands: <u>step</u> (single step  execution),  <u>go</u>  (execute  until
       breakpoint),  <u>list</u>  (look  at  core),  <u>trace</u>  and <u>untrace</u> (set and remove breakpoints), and go on to more
       complex ones later.

       The following commands are available at the  <u>cdb</u>  prompt;  commands  can  be  abbreviated  to  the  first
       unambiguous substring.

       <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b>
              repeats the last command issued at the <u>cdb</u> prompt.

       <b>help</b>   displays a brief command summary.

       <b>progress</b>
              displays the status of the current game in progress.

       <b>registers</b>
              displays the current state of the simulator, including program counters and task queues.

       <b>go</b>     runs the simulator until an instruction whose trace bit is set is executed. If there are no traced
              instructions <u>go</u> returns to the post-mortem debugger.

       <b>step</b>   executes the next instruction in the task queue and returns to the <u>cdb</u> prompt.

       <b>continue</b>
              returns to the simulator to complete the game without interruptions.

       <b>thread</b> is similar to <u>step</u> except that only the current task thread is traced.

       <b>skip</b> <b>[count]</b>
              executes the next <u>[count]</u> instructions in the queue silently before returning to the <u>cdb</u> prompt.

       <b>execute</b> <b>[address]</b>
              resets  the  task  queue  of  the  current warrior to <u>[address]</u> and executes it. This is useful in
              conjunction with <u>edit.</u>

       <b>quit</b>   aborts <u>pMARS</u> and returns to the OS prompt.

       <b>trace</b> <b>[range]</b>
              sets the trace bit of the specified address or address range.

       <b>untrace</b> <b>[range]</b>
              clears the trace bit of the specified address or address range.

       <b>moveable</b> <b>on|off</b>
              specifies whether the trace bit is copied by the MOV.I instruction. The default is on.

       <b>list</b> <b>[range]</b>
              displays the specified range of core addresses, a set trace bit is indicated by  'T'.   Unmodified
              addresses (DAT.F 0,0) are shown as blank.

       <b>edit</b> <b>[range]</b>
              allows  modifying  core.  The specified addresses are edited by typing in new instructions. Typing
              one or more spaces leaves the core address unchanged,  just  hitting  &lt;return&gt;  repeats  the  last
              input,  and  a  syntax error aborts the edit. The full <u>Redcode</u> syntax including labels and (multi-
              line) EQUates can be used. Label and  EQUate  definitions  remain  in  effect  until  the  program
              terminates.   The <u>edit</u> command is useful for modifying warriors and trying out single instructions
              without having to exit and restart <u>pMARS.</u>

       <b>fill</b> <b>[range]</b>
              is similar to <u>edit.</u>  Instructions in the specified range are replaced by one typed in instruction.
              Entering DAT.F 0,0 ,e.g. clears the address range.

       <b>search</b> <b>[pattern]</b>
              searches core instructions for a text pattern in  the  forward  direction.  The  next  instruction
              matching  [pattern]  is displayed. The search includes the address number and trace symbol (T), is
              case- and space-insensitive and  may  contain  wildcards:  *  (asteriks)  matches  any  number  of
              characters; ? (question mark) matches exactly one character. E.g. "search ," searches for the next
              non-blank address; "search dat*, ?0t" searches for the next DAT instruction that is traced and has
              a zero B-operand value, regardless of modifier, A-operand and B-mode.

       <b>write</b> <b>[file]</b>
              opens  a file for logging subsequent <u>cdb</u> output to. The logfile is closed by issuing <u>write</u> without
              an argument.

       <b>echo</b> <b>[string]</b>
              is used mostly inside macros. [string] is echoed to the screen followed by &lt;newline&gt;.

       <b>remark</b> <b>[string]</b>
              is ignored by <u>cdb</u> and can therefore be used to comment macros.

       <b>cls</b>    clears the screen. The no-display UNIX version does this by echoing an ANSI  escape  sequence;  if
              this  doesn't work for you, you need to change the CLRSCR string in config.h and recompile.  <u>clear</u>
              is a synonym for <u>cls</u> <u>.</u>

       <b>display</b> <b>clear|on|off|nnn</b>
              (available in display versions only) allows clearing the core display <u>(display</u> <u>clear)</u> or  changing
              the  display  mode.   <u>display</u>  <u>on</u>  changes  the  display to the default mode, <u>display</u> <u>off</u> (same as
              <u>display</u> <u>0</u> <u>)</u> suspends all display updates, and <u>display</u> <u>nnn</u> <u>,</u> where nnn is a 1  to  3-digit  number,
              sets  the  display  to  this  mode. "nnn" is interpreted like the parameter to the <u>-v</u> command line
              option (see APPENDIX).

       <b>switch</b> <b>[1|2]</b>
              (available in display versions only) makes the left (1) or right (2) panel the current  panel  for
              <u>cdb</u>  output.  Without  a  number  argument  <u>switch</u>  changes to the other panel. If the right panel
              doesn't exist (initially, or after <u>close,</u> <u>see</u> <u>below),</u> <u>it</u> <u>is</u> <u>created</u> <u>first.</u>

       <b>close</b>  (available in display versions only) closes the right <u>cdb</u> panel (if it exists) and makes the  left
              panel fullscreen.

       <b>calc</b> <b>expr1[,expr2]</b>
              is  a  command  line  calculator.  Since <u>calc</u> has no side-effects other than echoing the result of
              expression 1 (and expression 2 if provided). In the context of <u>cdb</u>  macros  it  is  also  used  to
              assign values to the register variables 'c' through 'z'.

       <b>macro</b> <b>[name][,file]</b>
              loads,  executes  or  lists  macros.  A macro expands to one line of cdb commands separated by the
              tilde character (~) (a so-called command chain, see below).  The command <u>macro</u> <u>name</u>  executes  the
              macro  "name";  if "name" is left out, all currently available macros are listed.  <u>macro</u> <u>name,file</u>
              loads macro definitions from file "file" and executes macro "name"; again, if "name"  is  missing,
              only  a  listing  is  produced.  Macro  definitions  are appended to the list of previously loaded
              definitions or replace a previously loaded macro definition with the same name. If you are  trying
              to  execute or list macros, but no macros have been loaded yet, the default macro file "pmars.mac"
              is loaded automatically. The special macro file "user" can be specified to input macro definitions
              directly from the keyboard. Macro definitions consist of a macro name, followed by the equal sign,
              followed by a command (chain).  The macro name can consist of any  printable  character  excluding
              &lt;space&gt;  and  comma;  the equal sign is only allowed at the end of a macro name.  Individual macro
              lines have a limit of 80 characters, but macro calls inside macro expansions are allowed.  <u>Cdb</u> can
              hold up to 200 macros in memory.  See also the section on <u>cdb</u> macro programming below.

       <b>if</b> <b>&lt;expression&gt;</b>
              controls execution of commands in macros or command chains. If <u>&lt;expression&gt;</u> evaluates to zero, the
              next command block is skipped. A command block consists of either a single command or  any  number
              of  commands  bracketed  by  !!  (loop start) and ![e] (loop end, see section on macro programming
              below).  <u>&lt;expression&gt;</u> may contain C-style comparison and boolean operators  (see  below).   An  <u>if</u>
              immediately preceding a loop end (![e]) can skip out of the loop.

       <b>reset</b>  is used inside macros in conjunction with <u>if</u> to terminate macro execution, e.g. inside an infinite
              loop (...~if A==0~reset~...~!).

       <b>pqueue</b> <b>[1|2|..|off]</b>
              switches  <u>cdb</u>  into "process queue mode". In this mode, <u>list,</u> <u>edit</u> and <u>fill</u> operate on the process
              queue instead of the core array, i.e. you can view and modify the process queue as easily  as  the
              core  array.  This  is especially useful for debugging complicated multi-process warriors.  <u>pqueue</u>
              without argument uses the process queue of the current warrior. With  argument  1,2,..,  uses  the
              process queue of warrior 1,2,.., respectively.  <u>pqueue</u> <u>off</u> returns to normal mode.

       <b>wqueue</b> <b>[off]</b>
              stands for "warrior queue" and is similar to <u>pqueue,</u> except that numbers provided as arguments for
              <u>list,</u>  <u>edit</u>  and  <u>fill</u> now refer to warriors: "list 0" now shows the program counter of warrior 1,
              "list 1" that of warrior 2 and so on.  <u>wqueue</u> <u>off</u> returns to normal "address mode".

       <b>pspace</b> <b>[1|2|..|off]</b>
              complements the <u>pqueue</u> and <u>wqueue</u> commands. If a number is specified, the P-space of that  warrior
              is  selected  for  viewing/editing.  Without  an  argument, the P-space of the currently executing
              warrior is selected. "pspace off" returns to core mode.

       <u>go,</u> <u>step,</u> <u>continue</u> and <u>thread</u> may have a single address argument. The  program  counter  of  the  current
       warrior is set to this address before execution continues.

       The range argument of the <u>list,</u> <u>trace,</u> etc. commands has the format &lt;start&gt;,&lt;stop&gt;. Addresses &lt;start&gt; and
       &lt;stop&gt;  are numbers, special symbols or C-style expressions including special symbols.  If either &lt;start&gt;
       or &lt;stop&gt; is omitted, it defaults to the current address.  If both are omitted, the range of the last <u>cdb</u>
       command is used. A single address (without the comma) acts on only that address. Addresses starting  with
       a + or - are interpreted relative to the current address.

       Expressions may contain the arithmetic operators -,+,*,/,% (modulo), the comparison operators ==, !=, &lt;=,
       &gt;=, and the boolean operators &amp;&amp; (AND), || (OR), and ! (negation).  Expressions may also include register
       variables  C  through Z and the assignment operator =. Operator precedence is like that of the C-language
       and may be overridden by parentheses. Assignment, comparison and boolean operations are mostly used  with
       <u>calc</u> and <u>if</u> commands in macros, but can also be used in Redcode operands.

       Special address symbols used in <u>cdb</u> commands:

        .     (dot) is the current address (displayed last).
        $     (dollar) is the last core address.
        A     is the A value of the current instruction.
        B     is the B value of the current instruction.
        PC    is the program counter of the currently executing warrior.
        PC1   is the program counter of warrior 1.
        PC2   is the program counter of warrior 2.
        LINES is the number of lines available to the cdb display
        CYCLE is the current execution cycle (counted down)

       In process queue (pq), warrior queue (wq) or pspace (ps) mode (see <u>pqueue,</u> <u>wqueue,</u> <u>pspace),</u> most of these
       symbols have a different meaning:

        .     (dot) is the current process number (pq),
              warrior (wq), or P-space cell (ps) which was displayed last.
        $     (dollar) is the last process in the process queue (pq),
              the last warrior (wq), or the last P-space cell (ps).
        A     is the A value of the instruction of the current process (pq),
              the next executing process of the current warrior (wq), or
              the P-space selector (ps, same as warrior number if unshared).
        B     is the B value of the instruction of the current process (pq),
              the next executing process of the current warrior (wq), or
              the P-space selector (ps).
        PC    is 0.
        PC1.. are 0

       Preceding  a  command with the character '@' (ampersand)  will suppress its screen output, but not output
       to a logfile.  Preceding a command with '&amp;' will suppress both screen and logfile output, which is useful
       if you are only interested in the "side-effects" of  a  command.   Starting  a  command  with  a  &lt;Space&gt;
       character suppresses saving it to the "last-command" buffer that is recalled by &lt;Enter&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>CHAINS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>MACRO</b> <b>PROGRAMMING</b></h4><pre>
       Several  commands  can  be  issued  on one line when separated by the tilde character (~). These "command
       chains" are useful for repeating long command sequences, since &lt;Enter&gt; recalls the entire chain (see  the
       examples below).  Commands requiring user intervaention <u>(list,</u> <u>edit,</u> <u>fill)</u> also read their input from the
       chain.

       The  "empty command" (two consecutive tildes or a tilde at the end of the chain) repeats the last command
       in the chain.  A command consisting of &lt;Space&gt; is a null command and is used to simulate pressing &lt;Enter&gt;
       in <u>list,</u> <u>edit</u> and <u>fill.</u>

       The exclamation mark (!) character is a  special  "chain  repetitor"  command.  The  optional  expression
       following  '!'  specifies  how  many times the command chain starting at the beginning of the line or the
       last ´!' is executed. '!' without an expression repeats until the program terminates.

       The symbol '!!' is used for nested loops and marks the start of a  command  block  to  be  repeated.  The
       command  block  is  closed  by  '![expression]'  and  may  contain  other command blocks. A command block
       immediately following an <u>if</u> command is executed only if the condition is true.

       With loops, subroutines (macros calling macros), variables (C..Z), expressions involving comparisons  and
       boolean  operations,  and  conditional  execution <u>(if),</u> the <u>cdb</u> command language can be used to construct
       complicated macros for e.g. executing a warrior until a certain core address has changed, controlling the
       2-panel display, automatically finding the right constants for a warrior, etc. See the  file  "pmars.mac"
       for examples.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b> <b>CDB</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>list</b> <b>,+20</b>
              lists the next 20 instructions.

       <b>trace</b> <b>pc-10,pc</b><u>+10</u>
              traces 21 addresses centered around the program counter of the currently executing warrior.

       <b>untrace</b> <b>0,$</b>
              clears all trace bits.

       <b>go</b>   <b>reg</b>   <b>l+a,+b</b>
              chains  these  commands:  execute  until  the  next  traced  address  or end of round, display the
              simulator status and list addresses in the range A-number to B-number of the current instruction.

       <b>@fill0,100</b> <b>dat.f</b> <b>0,0</b>
              fills addresses 0 through 100 with 'dat.f 0,0', not echoing the changed addresses to the screen.

       <b>write</b> <b>trace.log</b> <b>step</b> <b>!</b>
              produces a continuous execution trace by repeating <u>step</u> until <u>pMARS</u> terminates, saving the  output
              to logfile "trace.log".

       <b>@l</b> <b>x=5</b> <b>!!</b> <b>@ed</b> <b>x~dat</b> <b>x,0</b> <b>if</b> <b>(x=x+1)&lt;$+1</b> <b>!</b>
              This  command  chain  could be useful for debugging a stone-type, self-modifying warrior, which is
              assumed to occupy address 0 through 4 in this example. The command fills core starting at  address
              5  with  "dat  5,0",  "dat  6,0",  a.s.o.,  so that you can tell where a bomb which overwrites the
              warrior came from. To save some typing, you can turn this command into a  macro  (foo=@l  x=5~..).
              This  is  how  it  works, step by step: Assign 5 to register x and make it the current address (@l
              x=5). Start a loop (!!) and change address x to "dat x,0" (@ed x~dat x,0). Increment x,  if  x  is
              then  smaller  than  the core size ($+1), continue looping (if (x=x+1)&lt;$+1~!). The '@' in front of
              the <u>list</u> and <u>edit</u> commands suppresses screen output.

       <b>@s</b> <b>@4</b> <b>if</b> <b>b&lt;2</b> <b>||</b> <b>b&gt;=$-3</b> <b>reset</b> <b>!</b>
              This command executes a warrior until the B-field of address 4 points to address 0 through 5: Step
              and make address 4 the current address (@s~@4). If the B-field is less than 2 or greater  than  or
              equal to 7996 (CORESIZE-1-3) stop execution, else continue looping (if b&lt;2 || b&gt;=$-3~reset~!).

</pre><h4><b>SOURCE</b> <b>DEBUGGING</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b></h4><pre>
       Trace  bits  can  also  be set by including debugging commands in the warrior source. A comment format is
       used to retain compatibility with simulators that do not support source-embedded debugging commands.

       <b>;debug</b> <b>[static/off]</b>
              This command enables/disables all subsequent source-embedded commands.  It is used for  commenting
              out  other  source comments.  <u>;debug</u> <u>static</u> has the same effect as the command <u>moveable</u> <u>off</u> at the
              <u>cdb</u> command prompt.  <u>;debug</u> is implicitly added in front of every  warrior.  The  last  <u>;debug</u>  or
              <u>;debug</u> <u>static</u> encountered specifies whether the trace bit is copied by a MOV.I instruction or not.

       <b>;trace</b> <b>[off]</b>
              <u>;trace</u> starts setting the trace bit with the next instruction until EOF or a <u>;trace</u> <u>off</u> command is
              encountered.

       The <u>portable</u> <u>MARS</u> project was initiated after discussing  the  ICWS'94  draft  on  the  rec.games.corewar
       newsgroup.  We  realized that we needed a portable system to try out the proposed standard and to accept,
       modify or reject it.  The people who started <u>portable</u> <u>MARS</u> and are responsible for the base code as  well
       as the DOS and UNIX displays are:

</pre><h4><b>APPENDIX</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>PMARSV</b></h4><pre>
       <u>pMARSv</u> is a DOS version of <u>pMARS</u> with a graphical core display. You can chose between EGA/VGA graphics or
       text  mode  with  the  <u>-v</u>  command line options or by pressing 'v' during the game. The <u>-v</u> option takes a
       three digit argument 'xyz'. Digit 'x' specifies the initial display speed and ranges from 0 (fastest)  to
       7  (slowest).  'y' is the initial display mode: 0 for text mode, 1 for standard VGA graphics, 2 and 3 for
       SVGA, 4 and 5 for EGA, and 6 for CGA graphics.

       The display level 'z' specifies how much is displayed:

       <b>0</b>      Display nothing. This greatly speeds up execution, especially when in graphics mode.

       <b>1</b>      Display execution of addresses. In text mode, a black '0' on blue background is shown for  warrior
              1,  a  black  '1' on green for warrior 2, a.s.o.. Numbers blink in white when a DAT instruction is
              executed. In graphics mode, a blue square represents warrior 1, a green square warrior 2,  a.s.o..
              These colors are also used for other core accesses.

       <b>2</b>      Also  display  write accesses. In text mode, they appear as dots; in graphics mode, they appear as
              two pixels, offset diagonally.

       <b>3</b>      Also display decrements and increments. They are shown as '+' and '-' in  text  mode  and  as  two
              pixels offset vertically or horizontally in graphics mode.

       <b>4</b>      Also  display  read  accesses,  which  appear  as  small dots in text mode and as single pixels in
              graphics mode.

       The more is displayed, the slower runs the simulation.   The  argument  for  <u>-v</u>  defaults  to  103,  i.e.
       speed=1, mode=text, level=3.

       The  text  mode  display is very fast, but contains less on-screen information than the graphics display.
       The core display and the <u>cdb</u> debugger run full-screen on separate display pages.

       In graphics mode, core and debugger share the same screen. The mouse can be used to navigate around  core
       when  debugging  is enabled: clicking a mouse button on any core location lists addresses starting there.
       The mouse cursor follows the current program counter when in single step mode.

       In both graphics and text mode, the cdb display can be divided into  two  side-by-side  panels.  You  can
       switch  between  panels with the <u>switch</u> command (or the &lt;Tab&gt; macro) and close the right panel with <u>close</u>
       (or the &lt;Shft-Tab&gt; macro).  Extended (function keys, arrow/page keys, ALT keys, etc.)  and  control  keys
       generate  macro calls at the <u>cdb</u> prompt; some of these "hot key macros" have been defined in "pmars.mac";
       you can easily change them or add more with a text editor.  E.g. &lt;PgDn&gt; and &lt;PgUp&gt; keys currently  invoke
       macros that scroll through core one screen at a time.

       A  white line at the top of the display, called the time meter, indicates the time required to finish the
       current simulation. The amount of time depends on the number of warriors still alive in the arena.  After
       a  warrior  dies it no longer needs simulation time so the required time to finish the simulation becomes
       less. On the time meter this is indicated by a discontinuity. One can count the number of  dead  warriors
       in the arena by counting the number of discontinuities on the time meter.

       Just  below,  the  length  of  "process meters" in the color of the warriors they represent show how many
       processes each warrior has running.

       The following keys are available at the core display screen:

       <b>0..4</b>   selects the display level (see above).

       <b>v</b>      switches from text display to graphics display and vice versa.

       <b>&gt;</b>      increases the display speed.

       <b>&lt;</b>      decreases the display speed. The current speed is indicated by a red bar in graphics mode.

       <b>d</b>      enters the <u>cdb</u> debugger. "Debug" on the graphics menu bar is highlighted in red inside <u>cdb.</u>

       <b>&lt;space&gt;</b>
              (also 'r') refreshes the core display.

       <b>&lt;escape&gt;</b>
              (also 'q') exits to DOS.

       You can define additional keys and commands associated with them by defining "key-x" macros ("x"  is  any
       printable character). E.g.:
       key-p= progress~registers~continue
       Function-key and other macros can also be invoked from the core display.

</pre><h4><b>CURSES</b> <b>DISPLAY</b></h4><pre>
       The  curses  display  is very similar to the DOS text mode display. There are separate pages for core and
       debugger.  There is a status bar at the bottom of the core display:

       Rave [0]: 1        Lucky 3 [1]: 3702  Cycle: 72967  R: 2/5 (0 0 1)

       The display symbol that indicates execution is shown in brackets after the warrior name. The number after
       the colon shows the number of processes active.  The "2/5 (0 0 1)" means that this is round 2 of  5;  the
       result so far is one tie. Only cycle and round information is shown if more than two warriors are run.

       There  is  no "hot key" user interface during the core display, but you can enter the debugger by hitting
       Ctrl-C and clearing the display, changing the display mode, etc. from within <u>cdb.</u>   Only  the  first  and
       third  digit  of  the <u>-v</u> option and <u>display</u> command argument, namely the display speed and level, have an
       effect (see PMARSV above). The display speed setting (0=fastest, 7=slowest) adjusts  the  screen  refresh
       rate; depending on the size of your display, movement in core may appear "jerky" at fast speeds.  Control
       keys at the <u>cdb</u> prompt generate a macro call like in the DOS versions.

       If  you redirect standard input (by supplying a '-' filename or parameter file), all interactive input is
       disabled.

</pre><h4><b>MACINTOSH</b> <b>DISPLAY</b></h4><pre>
       <u>MacpMARS</u> is a Macintosh version of <u>pMARS</u> with a  graphical  core  display  and  standard  Macintosh  user
       interface.  It  has  two  windows,  the  Core  window  and Text window. The display of the core uses four
       patterns for each warrior (black and white backgrounds respectively) to show what  is  happening  in  the
       core:

       ´/' when the core location is written to (including incrementing and decrementing);

       ´\' when a process has died at the core location;

       ´-' when a process has executed at the core location;

       ´|' when a process is waiting to execute at the core location.

       If  you  click  on  a  core location in the Core window while a battle is being run, the contents will be
       displayed in the Text window.

       Two warriors can be in memory at any one time. To assemble a warrior choose "Choose  Warrior  n..."  from
       the  File  menu.  To  remove  the  warrior  from  memory choose "Remove Warrior n...". You can modify the
       settings used by choosing "Preferences..." (this  can  only  be  done  when  no  battle  is  being  run).
       Alternatively,  you  can  type in a command line in the same way as if you were typing from a unix prompt
       (if you're used to that sort of thing) by choosing "Command Line...". The Edit menu is  just  the  normal
       Macintosh  Edit  menu  and can be used to cut and paste text in the Text window and dialogs. The items in
       the Play menu are fairly self-explanatory: "Go" starts (or  continues)  a  battle;  "Step"  executes  one
       instruction  and enters the debugger; "Halt" halts the battle and enters the debugger; "Abort" aborts the
       battle. The Window menu is used to show and bring either of the two windows to the front of the screen.

       The <u>cdb</u> commands <u>display,</u> <u>switch</u> and <u>close</u> are not available in MacpMARS.

       Note: to use very large core sizes (up to about 65000) and process limits you may need  to  increase  the
       memory  partition  for  MacpMARS.  To do this, choose "Get Info" from the File menu in the Finder and set
       the preferred memory size to about 1200K.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       The following is mainly useful for people who write scripts or batch files for <u>pMARS.</u>  Upon normal  exit,
       the program returns 0. Below is a listing of what the abnormal exit codes mean. Your operating system may
       not support negative exit codes; in this case you have to convert the value to its unsigned counterpart.

           -4      graphics error
           -3      trying to execute 80386 code on a lesser processor
           -2      memory allocation error
           -1      serious program logic error, contact developers
            1      file not found
            2      command line error
            3      assembly error
            4      user aborted program
       The  exit  codes  of the VMS version conform to the VMS standard. The <u>-Q</u> <u>(Query)</u> command line option (see
       OPTIONS) allows you to customize the <u>pMARS</u> exit code. E.g. "pmars -Q  1000"  returns  the  current  <u>pMARS</u>
       version. Below the -Q arguments and what the resulting exit codes mean.

       <b>1..W</b>   exit code is score of this warrior, 1: first in result output, 2: second, a.s.o.. If the -o option
              is also given, "1" gives the score of the highest scoring warrior, etc..

       <b>101..1W</b>
              returns  the number of this warrior in the result output. Usually -Q 101 returns 1, -Q 102 returns
              2 etc., so this is not very useful. If you also specify the "-o" (order results)  option,  -Q  101
              returns  the  position  of the highest scoring warrior on the command line, -Q 110 the position of
              the 10th highest scoring warrior, etc..

       <b>1000</b>   exit code is the <u>pMARS</u> version in the same format as the predefined VERSION variable.

       <b>1001</b>   returns the <u>pMARS</u> "variant": 0 if the program was compiled with the SERVER option (no debugger), 1
              with debugger but without display, 2 with debugger and core display.

       <b>1002</b>   returns a combination of version and variant: 10*variant+version.

       <b>1003</b>   the exit code is the core address size in bytes. On a 32-bit CPU, this is sizeof(int), usually  4.
              With SMALLMEM compilation, core address size is sizeof(unsigned short), usually 2.

       <b>2000</b>   returns  how  many warriors share one or more P-spaces. A value of 4, e.g.  means that either four
              warriors share one P-space, or that two pairs of warriors share two P-spaces.
