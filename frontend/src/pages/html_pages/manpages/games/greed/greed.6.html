</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       greed - eat a game field until you run out of moves

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       galaxis [-s]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The object of Greed is to erase as much of the screen as possible by moving around in a grid of numbers.
       To move your cursor, simply use your arrow keys or the the 'hjklyubn' keys or your numeric keypad (with
       Num Lock on). Your location is signified by the @ symbol. The following diagram shows how the basic
       movement keys work.

           y k u  7 8 9
            \|/    \|/
           h-+-l  4-+-6
            /|\    /|\
           b j n  1 2 3

       When you move in a direction, you erase N number of grid squares in that direction, N being the first
       number in that direction. Your score reflects the total number of squares eaten.

       Greed will not let you make a move that would have placed you off the grid or over a previously eaten
       square. If no valid moves exist, your game ends.

       Other Greed commands are 'Ctrl-L' to redraw the screen, 'p' to toggle the highlighting of the possible
       moves, and 'q' to quit.

       The only command line option to Greed is '-s' to output the high score file.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The environment variable GREEDOPTS can override the default color set, which will be parsed as a string
       of the form:

                   &lt;c1&gt;&lt;c2&gt;&lt;c3&gt;&lt;c4&gt;&lt;c5&gt;&lt;c6&gt;&lt;c7&gt;&lt;c8&gt;&lt;c9&gt;[:[p]]

       where &lt;cn&gt; is a character decribing the color for digit n. The color letters are read as follows:

                   b = blue,
                   g = green,
                   c = cyan,
                   r = red,
                   m = magenta,
                   y = yellow,
                   w = white.

       In addition, capitalizing a letter turns on the A_BOLD attribute for that letter.

       If the string ends with a trailing :, letters following are taken as game options. At present, only 'p'
       (equivalent to an initial 'p' command) is defined.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /usr/lib/games/greed.hs

       This really ought to be an X game, but that would have been too much like work.
