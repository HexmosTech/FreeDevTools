</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       steam - Valve's Steam digital software delivery system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>steam</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] [<u>URL</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Steam  is  a  software  content delivery system developed by Valve Software.  There is some free software
       available, but for the most part the content delivered is non-free.

       Debian provides a wrapper script <b>/usr/games/steam</b> which will download and install the  proprietary  Steam
       interface on-demand.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All options provided to the <b>steam</b> script are forwarded to the proprietary Steam client.

       The  options  that  are  available  change  frequently,  and unrecognised options are usually ignored. An
       incomplete list is available from https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Command_Line_Options#Steam.

       Steam also accepts URLs with the <b>steam:</b> or <b>steamlink:</b> URL schemes. Some  of  the  available  actions  are
       documented in https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_browser_protocol.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       Steam is maintained by Valve, and is proprietary software.

       This  manual  page  was written by Simon McVittie for the Debian project (and may be used by others) as a
       replacement for the non-free man page provided by Valve.
