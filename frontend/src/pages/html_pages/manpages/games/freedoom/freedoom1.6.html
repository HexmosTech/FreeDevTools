</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       freedoom1 - Automatically launch Freedoom with an engine

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>freedoom1</b> [<u>-p</u> <u>DOOMPORT</u>|<u>--</u>] [<u>ARGS</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Freedoom is a project to create a complete free-content game based on the <u>Doom</u> engine (often called
       “source ports” or simply “ports”), which itself is free software. In addition, it maintains compatibility
       with <u>Doom</u> itself and is capable of playing the wide variety of modifications (“mods”) that have been
       released by an active community since 1993.

       This command is a simple shell script to assist in running Freedoom, which is not a game engine itself
       nor part of any engine project, but playing Freedoom should remain simple. The script tries to
       automatically select an engine based on a hard-coded list, but three overrides are available, in order of
       precedence: command-line argument, environment variable, and a $HOME/.doomport symbolic link. Passing <u>-p</u>
       <u>DOOMPORT</u> runs Freedoom using the <u>DOOMPORT</u> specified. Setting the <u>DOOMPORT</u> environment variable is
       similar, running the engine specified in the variable. An additional permanent setting is via the
       $HOME/.doomport symbolic link, which may point to an executable to run.

       Additional arguments passed to the program, or after specifying <u>--</u> as the first option, will be passed to
       the engine being called. This can allow you to use options such as <u>-file</u> to load mods or anything else
       available with the engine of choice.
