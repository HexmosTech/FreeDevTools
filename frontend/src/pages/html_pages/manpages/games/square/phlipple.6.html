       phlipple - puzzle game where you have to reduce 3D shapes to a single square

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Phlipple  is  a  unique  puzzle game. The goal of every level is to reduce a 3D shape to a single square.
       Elimination of squares is done by flipping edges around just like in a cardboard box.

       It starts off relatively easy to teach the basics just to later on serve hours  of  brain  tickling  fun.
       It's a great way to train memory as well as orientation in 3D.

       According  to the author, Phlipple is a game that came up in a dream. He woke up seeing what you will see
       in level 2, and knew that he had to code it.
