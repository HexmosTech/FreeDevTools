</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ricochet - client application for multi-player ricochet robots game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       ricochet --host &lt;hostname&gt; --port &lt;port&gt; --name &lt;username&gt; --game &lt;gamename&gt; --watch

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Ricochet</u>  is  a  client  for  the  Ricochet  Robots server (rrserve). It provides a view of the board and
       permits the user to fully interact with the server, both managing the set of games running in the  server
       and playing individual games.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Options are as follows:

       <b>--help,--usage</b>
              Print a help/usage message and exit.

       <b>-h,--host</b> <u>hostname</u>
              Select the host running the Ricochet Robots server. By default, ricochet connects to localhost

       <b>-p,--port</b> <u>port</u>
              Select the TCP port to connect to. By default, ricochet connects to port 5252.

       <b>-n,--name</b> <u>username</u>
              Specify the player name to present to the server. This name will be shown to all other players. By
              default, this is the user's login name.

       <b>-g,--game</b>  <b>gamename</b>
              Select  a  game  to  join  or create. By default, ricochet presents a dialog showing the available
              games and also allowing the user to create a new game.

       <b>-w,--watch</b>
              This allows the user to watch the selected game rather than participating in it.
