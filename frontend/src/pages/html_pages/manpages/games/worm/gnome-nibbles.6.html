</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Nibbles - A worm game for GNOME

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gnome-nibbles</b> [<u>OPTION...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Control a worm in its quest to eat bonuses and become longer. Outmaneuver enemy worms while eating apples
       and  bananas  to  increase  your  length.  Each  worm has six lives and loses one by running into a wall,
       another worm, or itself. The enemy worms are after the same bonuses that you are, so be careful.  If  the
       worms become too large, you won’t have much room to move.

       The  adventure progresses through 26 maps of increasing difficulty. The early levels are mostly open with
       a few walls, but later on, cramped spaces and teleporters make things more interesting.

       Play on your own against up to five enemy worms, or share your keyboard to play with a friend.
