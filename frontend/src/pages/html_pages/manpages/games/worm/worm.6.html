       worm — Play the growing worm game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>worm</b> [<u>size</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In  <b>worm</b>, you are a little worm, your body is the "o"'s on the screen and your head is the "@".  You move
       with the hjkl keys and the arrow keys (as in the game snake).  If you don't press any keys, you  continue
       in  the direction you last moved.  The upper case HJKL keys move you as if you had pressed several (9 for
       HL and 5 for JK) of the corresponding lower case key (unless you run into a digit, then it stops).

       On the screen you will see a digit, if your worm eats the digit is will grow longer,  the  actual  amount
       longer  depends  on  which  digit it was that you ate.  The object of the game is to see how long you can
       make the worm grow.

       The game ends when the worm runs into either the sides of the screen, or itself.  The current score  (how
       much the worm has grown) is kept in the upper right corner of the screen.

       The optional argument, if present, is the initial length of the worm.
