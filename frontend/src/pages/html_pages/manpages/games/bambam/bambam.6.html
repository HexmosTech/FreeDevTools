       bambam  is  a  keyboard and mouse game for babies written in Python.  Pressing letter keys prints them in
       random locations and colours.  Pressing  any  other  key  draws  little  pictures  in  random  locations.
       Dragging  the  mouse while the mouse button is pressed draws in randomly changing colours.  The screen is
       cleared at random.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>To</b> <b>quit,</b> <b>directly</b> <b>type</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>left-hand</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b>  <b>English</b>
       <b>locales,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>word:</b> <b>quit.</b>

       <b>Be</b> <b>aware</b> that there are ways to switch to another application from bambam:

       •      when  running  under  Wayland, it is not currently possible for bambam to grab all key presses.  A
              consequence of that is that if you use GNOME Shell, pressing the Windows (a.k.a. Super)  key  will
              activate  the activities overview.  Please check your environment.  As a workaround, starting with
              version 1.1.2, bambam will try to detect if it is running under Wayland.  If  this  is  the  case,
              bambam  will  display  a  warning  and  refuse to work.  You can disable this workaround, with the
              <b>--wayland-ok</b> option.

       •      bambam does not block virtual terminal switching (e.g.  CTRL+ALT+F1). See the example  50-dont-vt-
              switch.conf file if you would like to block that.

       •      there may be other yet unknown ways in other environments and window managers.

       For  the  above  reasons,  starting with version 1.2.0, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>and</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>bambam</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b>
       <b>dedicated</b> <b>login</b> <b>session.</b>

       •      One way to do this is to select BamBam session  type  from  your  display  manager  settings  when
              logging in (look for a gear icon).

       •      Another way is use command such as <b>exec</b> <b>startx</b> <b>bambam</b> from a text console.

       To  turn  the  sound  off  and  on, type <b>sound</b> in the game.  The legacy <b>mute</b> and <b>unmute</b> commands are also
       supported for now, they will be removed in a future version.

       To toggle sticky mouse buttons, type <b>mouse</b> in the game.  In this mode, the mouse button only needs to  be
       pressed once to start or stop drawing.

       bambam  loads  images  (GIF,  JPEG, PNG and TIFF files) and sounds (WAV and OGG files) from the following
       directories:

       •      the <b>data</b> directory distributed with the game,

       •      the <b>data</b> directory in bambam's <b>$XDG_DATA_HOME</b> subdirectory (typically <a href="file:~/.local/share/bambam/data">~/.local/share/bambam/data</a>)

       When scanning directories for files, bambam <b>does</b> follow symbolic  links  and  descend  directories.  This
       makes is easy to have bambam use files located elsewhere.

       As  of  version  1.3.0  bambam  has  experimental support for extensions, which are a way of changing the
       program behaviour.  Bambam loads extensions from the following directories:

       •      the <b>extensions</b> directory distributed with the game,

       •      the    <b>extensions</b>    directory    in    bambam's    <b>$XDG_DATA_HOME</b>     subdirectory     (typically
              <a href="file:~/.local/share/bambam/extensions">~/.local/share/bambam/extensions</a>)

       See the EXTENSIONS.md file for documentation on creating and modifying extensions.
