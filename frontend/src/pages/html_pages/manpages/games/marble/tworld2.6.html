</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tworld2 - Tile World 2

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Tile World is a reimplementation of the game "Chip's Challenge". The player controls Chip, navigating him
       through  his  challenges.  The object of each level of the game is to find and reach the exit tile, which
       takes you to the next level. The levels contain many different kinds of obstacles, creatures both hostile
       and indifferent, tools, protective gear -- and, of course, chips.

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>GAME</b></h4><pre>
       The main display shows Chip in the current level and his immediate surroundings. To  the  right  of  this
       display  is  shown  the basic information about the current level. The most important data shown here are
       how many seconds are left on the clock, and how many chips still need to be collected. (On some level the
       clock does not show a time. These levels have no time limit.)

       The object of every level is to find and reach the exit before the time runs out. The exit is  frequently
       (but  not  always)  guarded  by  a chip socket. To move past the chip socket, Chip must collect a certain
       number of computer chips; the amount needed is different  in  each  level.  As  you  play  a  level,  the
       information  display  on  the right shows the number of chips that still need to be collected in order to
       open the socket. (Remember that getting enough chips to open the chip socket is only a subgoal,  not  the
       main goal. Some levels do not require any chips to be collected; some levels have no chip socket at all.)

       Also  occupying  many of the levels are other creatures. Most (but not all) of them move about in simple,
       predictable patterns, and without regard for Chip's presence. The creatures know enough to avoid  running
       into each other, but a collision with Chip is fatal. The complete taxonomy of creatures is: tanks, balls,
       gliders, fireballs, walkers, blobs, teeth, bugs, and paramecia.

       In  addition  to  the socket and the main exit, there are also four different kinds of doors. These doors
       can be opened with the right kind of key. The doors and the keys are color-coded -- red, green, blue, and
       yellow -- so you can tell them apart. Like the chip socket, a door that has been opened stays open.  Keys
       are  picked  up  simply  by  stepping  upon  them.  The  key  disappears from the map and appears in your
       possession. Keys in your possession are displayed on the right-hand side of the window.

       Besides keys and chip, there are also four kinds of special footgear that Chip can  collect.  Like  keys,
       boots  can  be  picked  up simply by walking over them. (There is no limit to the number of boots you can
       have.) These boots permit Chip to walk across four different kinds of surfaces,  just  as  if  they  were
       normal flooring. Fire and water are two kind of tiles that are normally fatal to Chip, but fire boots and
       water  boots  will  permit  safe passage across these. Stepping onto ice sends Chip sliding at high speed
       unless he has a pair of ice boots.  Finally, there are force floors that push Chip along  in  a  specific
       direction; these can be counteracted with force boots.

       Two  other  types  of  surfaces are more useful to Chip, in that they keep other creatures out. These are
       dirt and gravel, and they are special in that Chip is the only one who can walk on  them.  However,  when
       Chip  steps  onto a dirt tile, it is cleared away and becomes normal flooring. Gravel, on the other hand,
       is permanent.

       There are numerous other objects scattered around the various  levels,  which  Chip  can  interact  with,
       although  he  cannot  pick  them up. Bombs are one kind of object which should always be avoided, as they
       explode when stepped on. The thief tile should also generally be avoided; entering this tile  will  cause
       Chip to lose any footgear he has collected.

       Dirt  blocks are large, movable squares of dirt. Chip can push them about, and use them to wall off areas
       or to safely detonate bombs.  Furthermore, if a block is pushed into water, the tile will turn into  dirt
       (which  will  become  normal flooring when Chip steps on it).  Finally, note that blocks can sometimes be
       resting on top of other objects, both helpful (such as a key) and harmful (such as a bomb).

       Some levels have teleports. Entering a teleport causes Chip to vanish  and  instantaneously  reappear  at
       another teleport.

       Even some of the walls can demonstrate surprising behavior. The so-called blue walls can either be actual
       walls, or empty mirages.  The only way for Chip to tell which is which is to attempt to walk through one.
       There  are also popup walls -- Chip can walk across these only once, for they turn into walls as he walks
       over them.

       There are four different types of pushbuttons. Like keys and boots, they are color-coded. Stepping  on  a
       pushbutton activates it.

       The  green  buttons  control  the  toggle walls. Toggle walls have dotted green outlines, and they change
       between being open (passable, like any other floor) and open (unpassable, a wall). When a green button is
       pressed, the closed toggle walls are opened and the open toggle walls are closed.

       Brown buttons control bear traps. Anything that wanders into a bear trap will be stuck  there  until  the
       brown button connected to it is pushed.

       Blue  buttons exercise some control over the tanks. Normally, a tank moves directly forward until it hits
       an obstacle, whereupon it stops.  But when a blue button is pressed, all tanks turn  around  180  degrees
       and begin moving again.

       The  objects  with the most potential for help and hindrance are the clone machines, which are controlled
       by red buttons. Every clone machine contains a dirt block, a tank, or some other creature. When the clone
       machine's red button is pressed, a duplicate of whatever the clone machine contains is  created  and  set
       loose.

       Once  in a while there will also be hint buttons. These have a question mark displayed on them. When Chip
       steps onto a hint button, a short bit of information will be displayed in the lower  right-hand  area  of
       the window.

       Here are some general hints for successful play:

       * When  moving  dirt blocks around, take care not to shove them into corners where you can't get them out
         again.
       * On some of the more mazelike levels, you may need to sketch out a map in order to solve it.
       * Many of the creatures move in specific patterns (for example, as with the tanks mentioned above).
       * A number of the objects in the game will affect other creatures in the same way they affect Chip.
       * Remember that if you get trapped somewhere, you can always use Ctrl-R to restart a level.
       * When you find a level to be unusually difficult, take some time to examine it carefully. Make sure  you
         truly know what options are available to you. In any case, keep trying. Occasionally the game will give
         you the opportunity to skip a level that seems too hard.

</pre><h4><b>PASSWORDS</b></h4><pre>
       Every  level  has a four-letter password. The password for a level is shown in the information display at
       the upper-right of the window. The ostensible purpose of passwords is to allow you  to  come  back  to  a
       level.  However,  normally  you  will  never need to remember passwords, as Tile World will automatically
       store the passwords for you. However, if you somehow manage to learn the password of  a  level  that  you
       have yet to achieve, you can use the password to gain early access to that level.

</pre><h4><b>SCORING</b></h4><pre>
       For  each  level  in  a  set  that  you  complete,  the  game awards 500 points times the level's number.
       Furthermore, if the level is timed, an extra 10 points is added for every second left on the  clock  when
       you  finish the level. You can thus sometimes improve your score by returning to already-completed levels
       and playing them again.

</pre><h4><b>KEY</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       During game play, the arrows are the most important keys; they move Chip through the level. The keys 2  4
       6 8 on the numeric keypad can also be used for the same purpose. Other keys have the following functions:

       <b>Bkspc</b>  pauses the game; press any key to resume play.

       <b>Ctrl-N</b> stops the current game and moves forward to the next level.

       <b>Ctrl-P</b> stops the current game and moves back to the previous level.

       <b>Esc</b>    quits the current level.

       <b>Ctrl-R</b> starts over at the beginning of the current level.

       <b>V</b>      decreases the volume level. (If the volume level is reduced to zero, then the program will display
              sound effects textually, as onomatopoeia.)

       <b>Shift-V</b>
              increases the volume level.

       At the start of a level, before game play begins, the following key commands are available:

       <b>Esc</b>    returns to the list of available level sets.

       <b>Spc</b>    starts the current level without moving (i.e., standing still).

       <b>N</b>      moves to the next level.

       <b>P</b>      moves to the previous level.

       <b>PgUp</b>   moves ahead ten levels.

       <b>PgDn</b>   moves back ten levels.

       <b>G</b>      displays a prompt and accepts a password, then jumps to the level with that password.

       <b>Tab</b>    plays back the best solution for that level.

       <b>Shift-Tab</b>
              verifies  the  best  solution for that level. If the solution is no longer valid (e.g. because the
              level has been altered), the solution will automatically be deprecated.

       <b>O</b>      toggles between even-step and odd-step offset.

       <b>Shift-O</b>
              (Lynx-mode only) increments the stepping offset by one.

       <b>F</b>      (Lynx-mode only) changes the initial direction for the "random" force floors.

       <b>Ctrl-X</b> deprecates the best solution for that level. If the level is then  successfully  completed  again,
              the saved solution will be replaced with the new one, whether or not it had a better time.

       <b>Shift-Ctrl-X</b>
              deletes  the saved solution for that level. If confirmed, the solution will be immediately removed
              from the solution file.

       <b>S</b>      displays the list of known levels and the score for each, as well as the  overall  score  for  the
              level  set. The score list display also permits changing the current level by moving the selection
              and pressing Enter.

       <b>Ctrl-S</b> displays the list of solution files in the save directory whose names start with the name  of  the
              current level set. From here a different solution file can be selected.

       A few commands are available only during solution playback:

       <b>D</b>      toggles the display of the stepping and (in Lynx mode) the initial direction of the "random" force
              floors.

       <b>PgUp</b>   goes back about 10 seconds.

       <b>PgDn</b>   goes forward about 10 seconds.

       <b>E</b>      advances the playback by a "tick". (1/10th second in MS, 1/20th second in Lynx.)

       <b>Shift-E</b> <b>advances</b> <b>the</b> <b>playback</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>.</b> <b>(1/5th</b> <b>second.)</b>

       At  every  point  in  the program, the Esc key will abort the current activity and return to the previous
       display.

</pre><h4><b>RULESETS</b></h4><pre>
       Tile World contains emulators for two different versions of "Chip's Challenge". They are referred  to  as
       the  Lynx ruleset and the MS ruleset. The Lynx ruleset recreates the original implementation of the game,
       and the MS ruleset recreates the version that was implemented for Microsoft Windows (cf <b>HISTORY</b>).

       The most notable difference between the two rulesets is that in the MS ruleset, movement between tiles is
       instantaneous, whereas under the Lynx ruleset  motion  occurs  across  several  "ticks".  (This  probably
       reflects  the  fact that the latter ran on dedicated hardware, while the former ran on 33 MHz PCs under a
       non-preemptive multitasking OS.)  Although the basic mechanics of  the  game  are  the  same  under  both
       rulesets, there are also a host of subtle differences between the two.

       Each  level  set  file  includes a flag that indicates which ruleset it is to be played under. Some level
       sets can be played under both rulesets (most notably, the original  set  of  levels),  but  this  is  the
       exception.

</pre><h4><b>ADDING</b> <b>NEW</b> <b>LEVEL</b> <b>SETS</b></h4><pre>
       Level  sets  are defined by data files. By convention these file are named with a .dat or .ccl extension.
       Classically, the name proper contains the author's first name, last initial, and a single  digit  --  for
       example,  a  set  by  someone  named  Bob  Nomo could be called BobN1.dat. (The digit is used to give the
       sequence in case the author, for whatever reason, stores their creations in more than  one  file.)   Some
       more  recent  level sets do not follow this naming pattern, however, so it is not always easy to find out
       the author from the set's name.

       When a new data file is obtained, it may simply be copied into the level set directory (cf  <b>DIRECTORIES</b>),
       and Tile World will then make it available for playing.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       tworld2  is  normally invoked without arguments. The program begins by displaying a list of the available
       level sets. After a level set is chosen, the program jumps (if possible) to the last level played in that
       set.

       The available command-line options are enumerated in the following table.

       <b>-a</b>     Double the size of the audio buffer. This option can  be  repeated,  so  for  example  -aaa  would
              increase the audio buffer size eightfold.

       <b>-b</b>     Do  a  batch-mode  verification of the existing solutions and exit.  Levels with invalid solutions
              are displayed on standard output. If used with -q, then nothing is displayed,  and  the  program's
              exit  code  is  the  number of invalid solutions. Can also be used with -s or -t to have solutions
              verified before the other option is applied. Note that this options  requires  a  level  set  file
              and/or a solution file be named on the command line.

       <b>-D</b> <u>DIR</u> Read level data files from <u>DIR</u> instead of the default directory.

       <b>-d</b>     Display the default directories used by the program on standard output, and exit.

       <b>-F</b>     Run in full-screen mode.

       <b>-H</b>     Upon  exit,  display  a  histogram  of  idle  time  on  standard  output. (This option is used for
              evaluating optimization efforts.)

       <b>-h</b>     Display a summary of the command-line syntax on standard output and exit.

       <b>-L</b> <u>DIR</u> Look for level sets in <u>DIR</u> instead of the default directory.

       <b>-l</b>     Write a list of available level sets to standard output and exit.

       <b>-n</b> <u>N</u>   Set the initial volume level to <u>N</u>, 0 being silence and 10 being full volume.

       <b>-P</b>     Turn on pedantic mode, forcing the Lynx ruleset  to  emulate  the  original  game  as  closely  as
              possible. (See the Tile World website for more information on emulation of the Lynx ruleset.)

       <b>-p</b>     Turn off all password-checking. This option allows the normal sequence of levels to be bypassed.

       <b>-q</b>     Run quietly. All sounds, including the ringing of the terminal bell, are suppressed.

       <b>-r</b>     Run in read-only mode. This guarantees that no changes will be made to the solution files.

       <b>-R</b> <u>DIR</u> Read resource data from <u>DIR</u> instead of the default directory.

       <b>-S</b> <u>DIR</u> Read and write solution files (and other saved data) under <u>DIR</u> instead of the default directory.

       <b>-s</b>     Display  the  current  scores  for the selected level set on standard output and exit. A level set
              must be named on the command line. If used with -b, the solutions  are  verified  beforehand,  and
              invalid solutions are indicated.

       <b>-t</b>     Display the best times for the selected level set on standard output and exit. A level set must be
              named  on  the  command  line. If used with -b, the solutions are verified beforehand, and invalid
              solutions are indicated.

       <b>-V</b>     Display the program's version and license information on standard output and exit.

       <b>-v</b>     Display the program's version number on standard output and exit.

       Besides the above options, tworld2 can accept up to three command-line arguments: the  name  of  a  level
       set,  the  number  of  a level to start on, and the name of an alternate solution file. If the name of an
       installed level set is specified, then Tile World will start up in that set, skipping the  initial  level
       set selection.

       If the specified level set is not a simple name but is a pathname (relative or absolute), then Tile World
       will  use  that  level set only, without requiring that it first be installed. No solutions will be saved
       unless an explicit solution file is  also  supplied  on  the  command-line.  (If  the  command-line  only
       specifies a solution file, then Tile World will look up the name of the level set in the solution file.)

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration  files  are  used  to  override  some  of the settings in a data file, or to set values not
       provided for by the data file format.  Starting in Tile World 2.2, they are generated  automatically,  so
       you  don't  need  to  mess  with them unless you want to change the defaults.  Configuration files are by
       convention named with a .dac extension. A configuration file  is  stored  in  the  sets  directory.  (cf.
       <b>DIRECTORIES</b>).

       The  configuration  file  is  a  simple  text  file. The first line of a configuration file <u>must</u> have the
       following form:

       file = <u>DATAFILE</u>

       where <u>DATAFILE</u> is the filename of the data file. (Arbitrary whitespace  is  permitted  around  the  equal
       sign, but there cannot be any whitespace embedded at the beginning of the line.) After this initial line,
       the configuration file can contain any of the following lines:

       fileinsetsdir = <u>y|n</u>

       This  specifies  that  the  level set is found in the sets directory, rather than the data directory. The
       default is n.

       usepasswords = <u>y|n</u>

       This line permits password-checking to be enabled/disabled when  playing  the  levels  in  the  set.  The
       default is y.

       ruleset = <u>ms|lynx</u>

       This  line allows the configuration file to override the ruleset setting in the data file. This is mainly
       useful in the case where one level set is playable under either ruleset (as is the case with the original
       level set). The author can then provide one data file and two configuration files to make  both  versions
       available.

       lastlevel = <u>levelnum</u>

       This line marks an arbitrary level as being the last level in the set. The game will stop when this level
       is  completed,  instead  of proceeding to the next level. (Note that if the data file contains any levels
       beyond this one, they will only be reachable via a password.)

       fixlynx = <u>y|n</u>

       This line is specifically for use with the original level  set.  It  is  not  generally  useful,  and  is
       described  here  only  for  completeness.  The  chips.dat  file that MS distributed with their version of
       "Chip's Challenge" contained a few minor differences from the original level set as appeared on the Lynx.
       A positive value for this entry instructs the program to undo those changes, so that  the  original  Lynx
       level set is obtained. (The changes made in the MS version were: an extra level was added; four passwords
       were garbled; and four or five levels' maps had minor alterations.)

</pre><h4><b>CCX</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  data directory may contain a file with the same name as a level set, but with a .ccx extension. This
       file can be used to specify various data, such as ruleset compatibility  and  authorship  (both  for  the
       entire  set  and  for  individual  levels. It is also possible to specify text displayed when reaching or
       completing levels. This can be used to give an ongoing story for a level  set,  or  for  other  purposes.
       Detailed  documentation  does  not currently exist. One way to produce a CCX file for a set is to emulate
       the structure of an existing one (such as that for CCLP1 or CCLP3).  You  can  also  use  the  "CCX  File
       Editor" by Mike Lask.

       Some  people  may  wish  not to view text associated with levels. This can be controlled using the "Auto-
       display Level Text" menu under "Options". Whether or not this option is enabled, level text can be viewed
       using the "View Prologue" (for text displayed when visiting  a  level)  and  "View  Epilogue"  (for  text
       displayed when completing a level). The epilogue is only available for levels that have been completed.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       Tile  World  loads  various  resources  at  runtime  from its resource directory (cf <b>DIRECTORIES</b>).  These
       resources include the program's font, graphic images, and  sound  effects.  The  actual  file  names  are
       determined  by  the  contents  of  a  file  named  rc  (short  for "resource configuration", not "runtime
       commands") in the same directory.

       The rc file is a plain text file, and contains lines of the form

       <u>resource</u> = <u>filename</u>

       where <u>resource</u> is a symbolic resource name, and <u>filename</u> is the name of a file in the resource directory.

       The resources can be set differently depending on the ruleset that the program is using. A line in the rc
       file of the form

       [ <u>ruleset</u>]

       indicates that the lines that follow only apply when that ruleset is in effect (where <u>ruleset</u>  is  either
       MS or Lynx). Resources that are defined before any such line apply to both rulesets, and are also used as
       fallbacks if a ruleset-specific resource could not be loaded. (The font and the text-color resources also
       need  to  have  ruleset-independent  values,  as  these are needed when displaying the initial file list,
       before a ruleset has been chosen.)

       A line of the form

       TileImages = <u>FILENAME</u>

       identifies the file that provides the images used to draw the game.  These images are stored in a Windows
       bitmap. (See the Tile World website for more information about this resource.)

       A line of the form

       Font = <u>FILENAME</u>

       identifies the file that provides the program's font. The font is stored as a Windows  bitmap.  (See  the
       Tile World website for more information about this resource.)

       A line of the form

       UnsolvableList = <u>FILENAME</u>

       identifies  the  filename  for the database of unsolvable levels. See <b>DATABASE</b> <b>OF</b> <b>UNSOLVABLE</b> <b>LEVELS</b> below
       for more information about this file. Note that this resource must be defined independent of the ruleset,
       or else it will be ignored.

       A line of the form

       EndMessages = <u>FILENAME</u>

       identifies the filename for the messages displayed when losing or winning  a  level.  See  <b>END</b>  <b>OF</b>  <b>LEVEL</b>
       <b>MESSAGES</b>  below for more information about this file. Note that this resource must be defined independent
       of the ruleset, or else it will be ignored.

       Four resources define the colors used in rendering text:

       BackgroundColor = <u>RRGGBB</u>
       TextColor = <u>RRGGBB</u>
       BoldTextColor = <u>RRGGBB</u>
       DimTextColor = <u>RRGGBB</u>

       The value of <u>RRGGBB</u> is a string of six hexadecimal digits defining the red, green, and blue values of the
       color (as with the color specification used in HTML or X Windows, but without the preceding octothorpe).

       The remaining resources all define the game's sound effects. The sounds  are  stored  as  Microsoft  RIFF
       files  (so-called  wave files).  Unlike the tile images, each sound effect is defined as a separate file.
       The complete list of symbolic resource names is as follows:

       Sounds used in both rulesets

       * LevelCompleteSound
       * ChipDeathSound
       * BlockedMoveSound
       * PickupToolSound
       * ThiefSound
       * TeleportSound
       * OpenDoorSound
       * SocketSound
       * SwitchSound
       * BombSound
       * SplashSound

       Sounds used only under the MS ruleset

       * TickSound
       * ChipDeathByTimeSound
       * PickupChipSound

       Sounds used only under the Lynx ruleset

       * TileEmptiedSound
       * WallCreatedSound
       * TrapEnteredSound
       * BlockMovingSound
       * SkatingForwardSound
       * SkatingTurnSound
       * SlidingSound
       * SlideWalkingSound
       * IceWalkingSound
       * WaterWalkingSound
       * FireWalkingSound

       (Note that the symbolic names for the shared and MS-only sounds match the names in the  entpack.ini  file
       used  by  the  Microsoft  program.   This  makes  it  easy for someone with a copy of Microsoft's "Chip's
       Challenge" to use the sound effects that were provided with that version of the game.)

</pre><h4><b>DATABASE</b> <b>OF</b> <b>UNSOLVABLE</b> <b>LEVELS</b></h4><pre>
       Of the many thousands of user-created levels that are publicly available, there are  some  that  are  not
       possible  to  complete.  Some  of  these  are  intentionally  so (e.g. requiring the player to deduce the
       password to the next level). The remainder, however,  are  simply  due  to  poor  design,  and  there  is
       typically no indication that attempting to solve these levels is fruitless.

       To  help  alleviate  this,  Tile  World  comes with a database of levels that have been identified by the
       community to be definitely unsolvable. When the player visits a level that appears in  this  database,  a
       warning is displayed, and the password to the next level is automatically supplied.

       The  main  database  of  unsolvable levels is stored in the resource directory. In addition, a player can
       keep a separate database in a file of the same name in the directory for solution files. If present, Tile
       World will use the information from both of these files.

       The offending levels are identified by content as well as by name and number, so  that  updated  versions
       will  no  longer  be  identified as unsolvable. See the Tile World website for more information about the
       format of this file, and to check for updates to the database.

</pre><h4><b>END</b> <b>OF</b> <b>LEVEL</b> <b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       When you win or lose a level, Tile World displays a message. These messages can  be  customized  using  a
       file  in  the  resource directory, whose default name is messages.txt. This file can contain an umlimited
       number of messages for Tile World to choose from. The file consists of sections of the form

       : <u>messagetypes</u>
       <u>message</u>
       <u>message</u>

       Here, <u>messagetypes</u> can contain any of "die" (for when the player dies), "time" (for when the player  runs
       out  of time), or "win" (for when the player completes the level. It is possible to specify more than one
       type. For example, the file

       :die time
       Message 1
       Message 2 :die Message 3 :win Message 4

       specifies that either "Message 1" or "Message 2" can be displayed when the player dies  or  runs  out  of
       time,  "Message 3" can only be displayed upon death, and "Message 4" can only be displayed when the level
       is won.

</pre><h4><b>DIRECTORIES</b></h4><pre>
       Tile World uses four different directories for storing external files.  The following list enumerates the
       directories and describes their purpose. The default directories that the program uses can be  configured
       at  compile  time.  The  directories  can  also  be  changed  at  runtime via command-line options and/or
       environment variables (see below).

       <b>Sets</b>   This directory is used to hold the configuration files. For  backward  compatibility  only,  level
              sets can also be placed here.  (default for Linux: /usr/local/share/tworld/sets)

       <b>Data</b>   This  directory  is  used  to  hold  the  level  sets,  as well as CCX files.  (default for Linux:
              /usr/local/share/tworld/data)

       <b>Res</b>    This directory stores the graphics and sound files  used  by  the  program.  (default  for  Linux:
              /usr/local/share/tworld/res)

       <b>Save</b>   This directory is used for saving solution files, and settings. (default for Linux: <a href="file:~/.tworld">~/.tworld</a>)

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Two  environment  variables can be used to override the program's built-in defaults for which directories
       to use. They are as follows:

       <b>TWORLDDIR</b>
              Specifies a top-level directory, in which the program will look for the resource, level  set,  and
              data file directories.

       <b>TWORLDSAVEDIR</b>
              Specifies a directory for saving solution files and settings.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       "Chip's  Challenge"  was  created  by  Chuck  Sommerville,  and was originally written for the Atari Lynx
       handheld game console. ("Tile World" was  his  working  title  for  the  game.)  "Chip's  Challenge"  was
       published by Epyx (the company who designed the Lynx before selling the rights to Atari) in 1989, and was
       among the first set of games made available for the Lynx.

       "Chip's  Challenge"  was  subsequently  ported  to  several  other  platforms:  MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows
       (16-bit), Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Atari ST, and the Commodore 64. (A NES port was  also  planned,  but  never
       completed.)

       The  Windows  port  was  different  from most (perhaps all?) of the others in that it was not done by the
       original team at Epyx. Instead it was done by Microsoft and sold as part of Windows Entertainment Pack  4
       (and  later as part of Best of Windows Entertainment Pack). In the process of recreating the game for the
       16-bit Windows platform, Microsoft introduced a surprising number of changes  to  the  mechanics  of  the
       game.  Some  were  clearly intentional, some were done through ignorance or indifference, and others were
       simply bugs in the program.  The programs in WEP4 came pre-installed on many PC computers sold during the
       1990s, which is part of the reason why this particular version became  the  most  popular.  A  small  but
       fanatically  loyal community of adherents to the game connected via a MSN chatroom (and later through the
       internet). A few members of this community managed to decipher the format of the MS game's data file, and
       John K. Elion subsequently created a freeware level editor, called ChipEdit. As a result  there  are  now
       dozens of new level sets, created by fans of the game and all freely available.

       Atari  discontinued  support  for  the Lynx in 1994. When Epyx went under, the rights to their games were
       purchased by Bridgestone Multimedia.  Responding to the success of "Chip's Challenge", Chuck  Sommerville
       created  a  sequel  ("Chip's Challenge 2"). The sequel included the original game as a proper subset, and
       the company held the rights to both games.  Bridgestone  Multimedia,  who  has  now  become  Alpha  Omega
       Publications,  unfortunately  did  not see fit to actually release "Chip's Challenge 2". It was, however,
       finally released on Steam in 2015, alongside a port of the original game. The other  versions,  including
       the famous port by Microsoft, are no longer being sold and cannot be obtained except by purchasing a used
       copy (or by downloading an illegal copy).

       In 2001, Brain Raiter author began writing "Tile World" with the intention of recreating a version of the
       MS  game  for the Linux platform. At the encouragement of Chuck Sommerville, this project was expanded to
       include the goals of recreating the original Lynx game as well, and also making the program work under MS
       Windows in addition to Linux.

       In 2010, Madhav Shanbhag produced "Tile World 2", which had several new features. In 2014,  Eric  Schmidt
       produced  version  2.1.  In  2017,  he  produced version 2.2. Similarly, in 2023-4 Michael Hansen (Zrax),
       ChosenID, David Stolp (pieguy), A Sickly Silver Moon, G lander, and Eevee created version 2.3.

</pre><h4><b>APPENDIX:</b> <b>NOTES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>NOMENCLATURE</b></h4><pre>
       "Chip's Challenge" has seen several incarnations. Each had its own graphical rendering, and thus many  of
       the  objects  in the game are known by more than one name. For example, the four types of boots in the MS
       version of the game were known as fire boots, flippers (for water), skates (for ice), and  suction  boots
       (for  force  floors).  In  the original Lynx version, however, they were not even boots -- the four tools
       were fire shields, water shields, cleats, and magnets, respectively.

       Several of the creatures have seen a variety of names. The list of creatures given  in  <b>OVERVIEW</b>  <b>OF</b>  <b>THE</b>
       <b>GAME</b>  corresponds  to  the  MS  version  of  the  game.  In the original Lynx version, the paramecia were
       centipedes instead. In still other versions of the game, gliders were referred to as  ghosts  or  sharks,
       fireballs  were  flames, and teeth were called frogs. (You will also occasionally see bugs referred to as
       bees, and walkers referred to as dumbbells.)

       Finally, the thief tile was called a spy in the MS version.

       None of this information is needed in order to play the game, but it helps to explain the titles of  some
       of the user-created levels.
