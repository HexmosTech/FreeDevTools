</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hex-a-hop - puzzle game based on hexagonal tiles

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Hex‐a‐hop is a puzzle game based on hexagonal tiles. There is no time limit and no real‐time element.

       The  objective  is  simply  to  destroy  all  the green hexagonal tiles on each of the 100 levels. As you
       progress through the game, more types of tiles are  introduced  which  make  things  more  difficult  and
       interesting.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  move the character around with the keys Q,W,E,A,S,D, or with the numeric keypad. Alternatively,
       you can use the mouse and click on the tile you'd like to move to.

       Use 'U', backspace or the right mouse button to undo mistakes.  The 'Esc' key (or  middle  mouse  button)
       brings up a menu from which you can restart if you get stuck.

       Your  goal  is  to break all the green tiles. You mainly do this by jumping on them. They will crack when
       you land on them, and only disintegrate when you jump off. Try not to trap yourself!

       During the game, you will be given hints and instructions on what to do. Use the cursor keys or click  on
       the  arrows  to scroll through the help pages. More pages will be added as you progress through the game,
       as new tiles will keep appearing.

       You can choose which level to attempt next from the map screen. Silver levels are  ones  you've  cleared.
       Black levels are ones you haven't completed yet, but are available to play.

       There is no time limit and no real‐time element, so take as long as you like.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       You can find more about the game on its homepage: <a href="http://hexahop.sourceforge.net/">http://hexahop.sourceforge.net/</a>
