</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>attraction</u> program has several visually different modes of operation, all of which are based  on  the
       interactions of a set of control points which attract each other up to a certain distance, and then begin
       to repel each other.  The attraction/repulsion is proportional to the distance between any two particles.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>attraction</u> accepts the following options:

       <b>--window</b>
               Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       <b>--root</b>  Draw on the root window.

       <b>--window-id</b> <u>number</u>
               Draw on the specified window.

       <b>--mono</b>  If on a color display, pretend we're on a monochrome display.

       <b>--install</b>
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       <b>--visual</b> <u>visual</u>
               Specify  which  visual  to  use.   Legal  values are the name of a visual class, or the id number
               (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.

       <b>--points</b> <b>integer</b>
               How many control points should be used, or 0 to select the number randomly.  Default 0.   Between
               3 and 15 works best.

       <b>--threshold</b> <b>integer</b>
               The  distance  (in  pixels)  from  each particle at which the attractive force becomes repulsive.
               Default 100.

       <b>--mode</b> <b>balls</b> <b>|</b> <b>lines</b> <b>|</b> <b>polygons</b> <b>|</b> <b>tails</b> <b>|</b> <b>splines</b> <b>|</b> <b>filled-splines</b>
               In <u>balls</u> mode (the default) the control points are drawn  as  filled  circles.   The  larger  the
               circle, the more massive the particle.

               In  <u>lines</u>  mode, the control points are connected by straight lines; the effect is something like
               <u>qix</u>.

               In <u>polygons</u> mode, the control points are connected by straight lines, and  filled  in.   This  is
               most interesting in color.

               In <u>splines</u> mode, a closed spline is interpolated from the control points.

               In  <u>filled-splines</u>  mode,  the  splines  are  filled  in instead of being outlines.  This is most
               interesting in color.

               In <u>tails</u> mode, the path which each particle follows is indicated  by  a  worm-like  trail,  whose
               length is controlled by the <u>segments</u> parameter.

       <b>--size</b> <b>integer</b>
               The  size  of  the balls in pixels, or 0, meaning to select the sizes randomly (the default.)  If
               this is specified, then all balls will be the same size.  This option has an effect in all modes,
               since the ``size'' of the balls controls their mass.

       <b>--segments</b> <b>integer</b>
               If in <u>lines</u> or <u>polygons</u> mode, how many sets of line segments or polygons should be drawn. Default
               500.  This has no effect in <u>balls</u> mode.  If <u>segments</u> is 0, then no segments will ever  be  erased
               (this is only useful in color.)

       <b>--delay</b> <b>microseconds</b>
               How much of a delay should be introduced between steps of the animation.  Default 10000, or about
               0.01 seconds.

       <b>--color-shift</b> <b>int</b>
               If  on  a  color display, the color of the line segments or polygons will cycle through the color
               map.  This specifies how many lines will be drawn before a new color is chosen.   (When  a  small
               number  of colors are available, increasing this value will yield smoother transitions.)  Default
               3.  This has no effect in <u>balls</u> mode.

       <b>--radius</b>
               The size in pixels of the circle on which the points are initially positioned.   The  default  is
               slightly smaller than the size of the window.

       <b>--glow</b>  This is consulted only in <u>balls</u> mode.  If this is specified, then the saturation of the colors of
               the points will vary according to their current acceleration.  This has the effect that the balls
               flare brighter when they are reacting to each other most strongly.

               In  <u>glow</u>  mode,  all  of  the  balls will be drawn the same (random) color, modulo the saturation
               shifts.  In non-glow mode, the balls will each be drawn in a random color that doesn't change.

       <b>--noglow</b>
               Don't do ``glowing.''  This is the default.

       <b>--vx</b> <b>pixels</b>

       <b>--vy</b> <b>pixels</b>
               Initial velocity of the balls.  This has no effect in <b>--orbit</b> mode.

       <b>--orbit</b> Make the initial force on each ball be tangential to the  circle  on  which  they  are  initially
               placed,  with the right velocity to hold them in orbit about each other.  After a while, roundoff
               errors will cause the orbit to decay.

       <b>--vmult</b> <b>float</b>
               In orbit mode, the initial velocity of the balls is multiplied by this; a number less than 1 will
               make the balls pull closer together, and a larger number will make them move apart.  The  default
               is 0.9, meaning a slight inward pull.

       <b>--viscosity</b> <b>float</b>
               This  sets  the  viscosity  of  the hypothetical fluid through which the control points move; the
               default is 1, meaning no resistance.  Values higher than 1 aren't interesting; lower values cause
               less motion.

               One interesting thing to try is

                    attraction -viscosity 0.8 -points 300 \
                    -size 10 -geometry =500x500

               Give it a few seconds to settle down into a stable clump,  and  then  move  the  drag  the  mouse
               through it to make "waves".

       <b>--nowalls</b>
               This  will cause the balls to continue on past the edge of the screen or window.  They will still
               be kept track of and can come back.

       <b>--walls</b> This will cause the balls to bounce when they get to the edge of the screen or window.   This  is
               the default behavior.

       <b>--maxspeed</b>
               Imposes  a maximum speed (default).  If a ball ends up going faster than this, it will be treated
               as though there were .9  viscosity until it is  under  the  limit.  This  stops  the  balls  from
               continually  accelerating  (which  they have a tendency to do), but also causes balls moving very
               fast to tend to clump in the lower right corner.

       <b>--nomaxspeed</b>
               If this is specified, no maximum speed is set for the balls.

       <b>--fast-bounce</b>
               Uses the old, simple bouncing algorithm (default).  This simply moves any ball  that  is  out  of
               bounds  back to a wall and reverses its velocity.  This works fine for most cases, but under some
               circumstances, the simplification can lead to annoying effects.

       <b>--correct-bounce</b>
               Uses a more intelligent bouncing algorithm.  This method actually  reflects  the  balls  off  the
               walls  until they are within bounds.  This can be slow if balls are bouncing a whole lot, perhaps
               because of -nomaxspeed.

       <b>--graphmode</b> <b>none</b> <b>|</b> <b>x</b> <b>|</b> <b>y</b> <b>|</b> <b>both</b> <b>|</b> <b>speed</b>
               For "x", "y", and "both", displays the given velocities of each ball as a bar graph in  the  same
               window as the balls.  For "speed", displays the total speed of each ball.  Default is "none".

       <b>--fps</b>   Display the current frame rate and CPU load.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> to get the default host and display number.

       <b>XENVIRONMENT</b>
               to  get  the  name  of  a  resource  file  that  overrides  the  global  resources  stored in the
               RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

       <b>XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW</b>
               The window ID to use with <u>--root</u>.
