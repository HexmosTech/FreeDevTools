       mog - Maze of Galious

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mog</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  documents  briefly  the  <b>mog</b>  command.   This  manual page was written for the Debian
       distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       <b>mazeofgalious</b> is a is a very adictive game where you have to kill thousands of enemies, collect items  in
       order  to  obtain new powers, and defeat some really great guys at the end of each level. You are free to
       go everywhere you want from the beginning of the game, you have to choose very  carefully  the  order  in
       which  you  visit all the rooms in the huge map if you want to keep your character to stay alive. The map
       is structures in a main map (called the castle), and 10 submaps (called the worlds), initially you are in
       the castle, and you have to find the keys that open the doors to go to each of the worlds.   To  complete
       the  game,  you  have to defeat the boss at the end of each one of the 10 worlds. You are free to revisit
       each world as often as you want, in order to see if you have missed something. To defeat all  10  beasts,
       you control two characters: Popolon and Aphrodite, and each one has special abilities, i.e. Popolon has a
       greater ability to jump and Aphrodite is able to dive.
