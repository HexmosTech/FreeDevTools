       barrage - rather destructive action game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>barrage</b> <b>[OPTIONS]</b>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b> <b>&lt;DELAY&gt;</b>

              wait &lt;DELAY&gt; milliseconds in the main loop and when fading; this may reduce CPU usage a great deal
              but may have impact on the frame rate depending on the speed of your CPU

       <b>-w</b>

              don't  start  in  fullscreen  but  in  windowed mode; you can switch this anytime while playing by
              pressing 'f'

       <b>-s</b>

              play silently, thus don't play any sounds; this can also be switched by pressing 's' while playing

       <b>-r</b>

              force (valid) resolution, can be used to fix bad auto detection or zoom window mode

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Barrage is a rather destructive action game that puts you on a shooting range with the objective  to  hit
       as  many  dummy  targets  as  possible within 3 minutes. You control a gun which may either fire small or
       large grenades at dummy soldiers, jeeps and tanks. The gameplay is simple but it is not that easy to  get
       high scores.

       See also /usr/share/doc/barrage/README for more information.
