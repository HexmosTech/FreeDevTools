</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sudoku - sudoku board game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       (play the game)
              <b>sudoku</b> [<u>options</u>] ...  [<u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>]

       (generate boards)
              <b>sudoku</b> <b>-g</b> [<u>&lt;num&gt;</u>] [<u>options</u>] ...

       (solve boards)
              <b>sudoku</b> <b>-v</b> [<u>options</u>] ...

       (calculate statistics)
              <b>sudoku</b> <b>-s</b> [<u>options</u>] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sudoku</b>  board game is played on a 9x9 grid, divided into rows, columns, and 9 blocks of 3x3 squares.
       The objective is to fill the empty squares with the digits 1-9, so  that  each  row,  column,  and  block
       contains  each of the digits 1-9 (and hence, it is not possible for any digit to appear twice in the same
       row, column or block).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Consider the following board, and the squares marked `<u>a</u>'-`<u>h</u>' and `<u>x</u>':

         5 . <u>a</u> | 6 <u>b</u> 1 | . . .       The digits appearing in each of the
         7 9 . | . . . | <u>c</u> 6 8       squares `<u>a</u>'-`<u>h</u>' can be uniquely
         <u>d</u> 3 . | . 8 . | 7 . .       determined. For example, the value
        -------+-------+-------      at `<u>a</u>' must be 8, since an 8 appears
         . 5 . | 4 1 <u>e</u> | . . 2       in the other rows and columns of the
         . . 1 | <u>f</u> <u>x</u> . | 6 . .       block. Using similar logic, it must
         8 . . | . 3 7 | . 4 .       be true that:
        -------+-------+-------           <u>b</u> = 7        <u>f</u> = 8
         . . 4 | . 9 . | <u>g</u> 2 .            <u>c</u> = 1        <u>g</u> = 8
         2 8 <u>h</u> | . . . | . 9 7            <u>d</u> = 1        <u>h</u> = 5
         . . . | 5 <u>i</u> 8 | . . 6            <u>e</u> = 6        <u>i</u> = 2

       In contrast, it is not possible to uniquely determine the value of `<u>x</u>' with the given  information  -  it
       could take either the value 2 or 5.  The board now contains the squares:

         5 . 8 | 6 7 1 | . . .    It is now possible to determine the values
         7 9 . | . . . | 1 6 8    appearing in other empty squares.
         1 3 . | . 8 . | 7 . .
        -------+-------+-------
         . 5 . | 4 1 6 | . . 2
         . . 1 | 8 <u>x</u> . | 6 . .    &lt;&lt;&lt; the value of <u>x</u> must now be 5.
         8 . . | . 3 7 | . 4 .
        -------+-------+-------
         . . 4 | . 9 . | 8 2 .
         2 8 5 | . . . | . 9 7
         . . . | 5 2 8 | . . 6

       Repeating this process a few more times reveals the solution:

         5 4 8 | 6 7 1 | 2 3 9
         7 9 2 | 3 4 5 | 1 6 8
         1 3 6 | 9 8 2 | 7 5 4
        -------+-------+-------
         3 5 7 | 4 1 6 | 9 8 2
         4 2 1 | 8 5 9 | 6 7 3
         8 6 9 | 2 3 7 | 5 4 1
        -------+-------+-------
         6 1 4 | 7 9 3 | 8 2 5
         2 8 5 | 1 6 4 | 3 9 7
         9 7 3 | 5 2 8 | 4 1 6

</pre><h4><b>GAME</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sudoku</b> game has a simple text interface (using the <b><a href="../man3/curses.3.html">curses</a></b>(3) library). The board is displayed in the
       middle of the screen, along with a summary of the allowed key presses. The cursor can be moved around the
       board using the arrow keys or the standard <b><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></b>(1) movement keys, and each square  (except  for  the  fixed
       board  squares  that  are  initially  revealed) can be set to a given digit by pressing the corresponding
       number key, or cleared by pressing either the `<u>0</u>' or `<u>.</u>'  keys.

   <b>Generating</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>Board</b>
       A new board can be generated at any time by pressing the `<u>n</u>' key, and  either  a  <u>precanned</u>  or  randomly
       generated board will be displayed.  If the <b>-n</b> command line option is set, then only <u>precanned</u> boards will
       be displayed.

   <b>Entering</b> <b>a</b> <b>Custom</b> <b>Board</b>
       A  custom board (e.g. found on the internet, or published in a newspaper) can be entered into the game by
       first clearing the current board (press the `<u>c</u>' key), entering the published squares  (using  the  cursor
       motion  keys  and entering the appropriate numbers), and then fixing the squares by pressing the `<u>f</u>' key.
       At this point, the entered squares will be fixed (and cannot be changed).

   <b>Hints</b>
       The interactive game provides a simple hint mechanism to provide assistance  in  solving  the  board.  It
       attempts  to  highlight  areas of the board where moves can be made. If repeated hints are requested, the
       system starts revealing the digit that can be placed on the board.

       A new hint can be requested by pressing the `<u>?</u>' key.

       Often the hints can be quite cryptic. For example, consider the board below:

           v v v

           . . 7 | . . <b>9</b> | . . .
           <b>9</b> . <b>6</b> | 7 <b>4</b> . | . <b>1</b> <b>5</b>
           . . <b>2</b> | <b>5</b> <b>1</b> . | . . .
          -------+-------+-------
        &gt;  <b>6</b> . <b>5</b> | . 7 . | . . <b>8</b>  &lt;    <u>The</u> <u>characters</u> <u>&gt;&lt;v^</u> <u>highlight</u> <u>the</u>
        &gt;  . <b>7</b> . | . . . | . <b>3</b> .  &lt;    <u>area</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>hint</u>
        &gt;  <b>8</b> . . | . . . | <b>7</b> . <b>6</b>  &lt;
          -------+-------+-------
           . . . | . <b>6</b> <b>7</b> | <b>8</b> . .
           <b>7</b> <b>4</b> . | . <b>5</b> . | <b>9</b> 6 <b>2</b>
           . 6 . | <b>4</b> . . | . . .

           ^ ^ ^

       The system gives the hint `<u>try</u> <u>the</u> <u>digit</u> <u>3</u>', but it is certainly not obvious, with the revealed  squares,
       where the 3 goes.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b><u>&lt;class&gt;</u>
              Generate a board until it finds a board of the specified class.  Supported classes are: very easy,
              easy, medium, hard, and fiendish.

       <b>-d</b>     Describe  the  moves  needed  to  solve the board. Can only be used with the <b>-v</b> option for solving
              <u>precanned</u> boards.

       <b>-n</b>     No random boards generated in the interactive game. Requires the optional file of <u>precanned</u> boards
              to be specified.

       <b>-r</b>     Run in restricted mode, disallowing any games to be saved.

       <b>-s</b>     Calculate statistics for the <u>precanned</u> boards, and attempt to classify the difficulty  of  solving
              the boards. Can be used with the <b>-v</b> option.

       <b>-t</b><u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              Set  the  template  file.  The  file  set  on the command line will be used instead of the default
              template file.

       <b>-v</b>     Solve <u>precanned</u> boards, writing the solution to standard output.

       <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              Name of the optional file containing <u>precanned</u> boards.

       <b>-w</b>     Write <u>default</u> <u>template</u> to the working directory if it doesn't exist yet.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables are used directly by the <b>sudoku</b> program.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/usr/share/sudoku/template</b>
              Template file for generating new sudoku boards.

       <b>/usr/share/sudoku/precanned</b>
              Optional file, containing `precanned' sudoku boards.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>/usr/share/sudoku/template</b>
       The template file contains a sequence of patterns that are used for generating new  <b>sudoku</b>  boards.  Each
       pattern  is  started by a line with a leading `%' character, and consists of 9 lines of 9 characters. The
       character `.' represents a square that is initially blank, and the character `*' represents a square with
       a digit that is initially displayed.

   <b>Compact</b> <b>text</b> <b>format</b>
       This format is similar to that of the template file, but contains representations of  game  boards.  Each
       board is started by a line with a leading `%' character, followed by an optional title for the board that
       is  displayed  when  the game is played. This is followed by 9 lines of 9 characters, where the character
       `.' represents an initially empty square, and the characters `1'-`9' give the  value  of  a  fixed  board
       square  that is initially displayed. The <b>sudoku</b> program can read precanned files in this format, and will
       write them when the <b>-fcompact</b> option is set.

   <b>Standard</b> <b>text</b> <b>format</b>
       This format is very similar to the compact text format, but includes additional characters to delimit the
       blocks in the board. The <b>sudoku</b> program can read precanned files in  this  format,  and  writes  them  by
       default, unless another output format is set by the <b>-f</b> option.

   <b>Comma</b> <b>separated</b> <b>text</b> <b>format</b>
       This format is useful for importing <b>sudoku</b> boards into a spreadsheet. It represents each board by 9 lines
       of  comma  separated  fields.  Each  field is blank, or contains a digit.  The <b>sudoku</b> program cannot read
       precanned files in this format, and writes them when the <b>-fcsv</b> option is  set.  Unlike  the  standard  or
       compact  text  formats,  there  are  no lines separating boards, and hence, it is really only feasible to
       store one board per file.

   <b>Postscript</b> <b>format</b>
       This format is useful for printing out <b>sudoku</b> boards. The <b>sudoku</b> program cannot  read  boards  stored  in
       this  format,  and  writes  them when the <b>-fpostscript</b> option is set. Unlike the standard or compact text
       formats, it is not possible to store multiple boards in the same file.

   <b>HTML</b> <b>format</b>
       This format is useful for printing out <b>sudoku</b> boards. The <b>sudoku</b> program cannot  read  boards  stored  in
       this  format, and writes them when the <b>-fhtml</b> option is set. Unlike the standard or compact text formats,
       it is not possible to store multiple boards in the same file.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       There are a large number of websites dedicated to the <b>sudoku</b> puzzle that can  be  found  easily  using  a
       search  engine.   Some  of  these  sites provide game boards that can be challenging to solve, and others
       provide strategies for finding moves.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       There are limited diagnostics available when an error occurs.
