       gnome-sudoku — puzzle game for the popular Japanese sudoku logic puzzle

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>gnome-sudoku</b> command.

       This  manual  page  was  written for the <b>Ubuntu</b> distribution because the original program does not have a
       manual page.

       <b>gnome-sudoku</b>  a simple player for  the  sudoku  number  logic  puzzle.  GNOME  Sudoku  generates  unique,
       symmetrical  puzzles  and  rates their difficulty. Games can be played or printed, so GNOME Sudoku can be
       used to print out a set of puzzles to take with you or to play a puzzle at a time on  screen.  All  games
       persist  across  sessions  and you can resume any old game at any time, as well as replay any game you've
       already won. More information about GNOME Sudoku can be found at <a href="http://gnome-sudoku.sf.net">http://gnome-sudoku.sf.net</a>
