</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       flsudoku - the fltk sudoku game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Sudoku</u> is a FLTK-based version of the game of Sudoku.  Sudoku (pronounced soo-dough-coo with the emphasis
       on the first syllable) is a simple number-based puzzle/game played on a 9x9 grid that is divided into 3x3
       subgrids. The goal is to enter a number from 1 to 9 in each cell so that each number appears only once in
       each column, row, and subgrid.

       At  the  start  of  a new game, Sudoku fills in a random selection of cells for you - the number of cells
       depends on the difficulty level you use. Click in any of the  empty  cells  or  use  the  arrow  keys  to
       highlight  individual cells and press a number from 1 to 9 to fill in the cell. To clear a cell, press 0,
       Delete, or Backspace. When you have successfully completed all subgrids, the entire puzzle is highlighted
       until you start a new game.

       As you work to complete the puzzle, you can display possible solutions inside each cell  by  holding  the
       Shift  key  and pressing each number in turn. Repeat the process to remove individual numbers, or press a
       number without the Shift key to replace them with the actual number to use.
