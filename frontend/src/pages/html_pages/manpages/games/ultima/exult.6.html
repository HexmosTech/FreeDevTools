</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       exult - an engine for running Ultima VII

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>exult</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Exult</b>  is an engine built for running Ultima VII. It started its life as a map-browser for Ultima VII and
       has evolved from there, thanks to the open source-model and contributions of  time  and  code  from  many
       people.

       You  cannot  use  <b>Exult</b>  without game data files. At present, the only finished games are Origin's Ultima
       VII: The Black Gate and Ultima VII, Part 2: The Serpent Isle. In any case, both Ultima VII's are some  of
       the  best  computer Role-Playing-Games made to date. Check your local computer dealer's bargain bin or an
       online auction site. Ultima VII can still be purchased for only a few dollars. Run out and buy it!

       There is a world editor available to create your own games: Exult Studio. Check the <b>exult</b>  homepage  (URL
       below) for more information.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h, --help
              Show the available command-line options

       -v, --version
              Display (detailed) <b>Exult</b> version information

       -c <u>configfile</u>

       --nomenu
              Skip the game menu for BG/SI

       --buildmap <u>type</u>
              Create  a  fullsize map of the current gameworld.  If <u>type</u> = 0, paint all roofs. If <u>type</u> = 0, skip
