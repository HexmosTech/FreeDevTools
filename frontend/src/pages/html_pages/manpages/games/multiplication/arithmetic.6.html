       arithmetic — quiz on simple arithmetic

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>arithmetic</b> [<b>-o</b> <u>+-x/</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>range</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>arithmetic</b>  asks  you  to  solve problems in simple arithmetic.  Each question must be answered correctly
       before going on to the next.  After every 20 problems, it prints the score so far  and  the  time  taken.
       You can quit at any time by typing the interrupt or end-of-file character.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-o</b>      By  default,  <b>arithmetic</b>  asks  questions  on addition of numbers from 0 to 10, and corresponding
               subtraction.  By supplying one or more of the characters  <u>+-x/</u>,  you  can  ask  for  problems  in
               addition,  subtraction,  multiplication,  and  division,  respectively.  If you give one of these
               characters more than once, that kind of problem will be asked correspondingly more often.

       <b>-r</b>      If a <u>range</u> is supplied, <b>arithmetic</b> selects the numbers in its problems in the following way.  For
               addition and multiplication, the numbers to be added or  multiplied  are  between  0  and  <u>range</u>,
               inclusive.  For subtraction and division, both the required result and the number to divide by or
               subtract  will  be between 0 and <u>range</u>.  (Of course, <b>arithmetic</b> will not ask you to divide by 0.)
               The default

       range   is 10.

       When you get a problem wrong, <b>arithmetic</b> will remember the numbers involved,  and  will  tend  to  select
       those  numbers  more  often  than  others,  in problems of the same sort.  Eventually it will forgive and
       forget.

       <b>arithmetic</b> cannot be persuaded to tell you the right answer.  You must work it out for yourself.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       “What?” if you get a question wrong.  “Right!”  if  you  get  it  right.   “Please  type  a  number.”  if
       <b>arithmetic</b> doesn't understand what you typed.
