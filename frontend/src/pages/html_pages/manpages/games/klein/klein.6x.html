</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>klein</u> program shows three different Klein bottles in 4d: the figure-8 Klein bottle, the pinched torus
       Klein bottle, or the Lawson Klein bottle.  You can walk on the Klein bottle, see it turn in 4d,  or  walk
       on it while it turns in 4d.  The figure-8 Klein bottle is well known in its 3d form.  The 4d form used in
       this program is an extension of the 3d form to 4d that does not intersect itself in 4d (which can be seen
       in  the  depth  colors  mode  when  using  static  colors).  The pinched torus Klein bottle also does not
       intersect itself in 4d (which can be seen in the depth colors mode when using static colors).  The Lawson
       Klein bottle, on the other hand, does intersect itself in 4d.  Its primary use is  that  it  has  a  nice
       appearance for walking and for turning in 3d.

       The  Klein  bottle  is  a non-orientable surface.  To make this apparent, the two-sided color mode can be
       used.  Alternatively, orientation markers (curling arrows) can be drawn as a texture map on  the  surface
       of  the  Klein  bottle.   While  walking on the Klein bottle, you will notice that the orientation of the
       curling arrows changes (which it must because the Klein bottle is non-orientable).

       The program projects the 4d Klein bottle to 3d using either a perspective or an orthographic  projection.
       Which of the two alternatives looks more appealing depends on the viewing mode and the Klein bottle.  For
       example,  the  Lawson Klein bottle looks nicest when projected perspectively.  The figure-8 Klein bottle,
       on the other hand, looks nicer while walking when projected orthographically from 4d.   For  the  pinched
       torus Klein bottle, both projection modes give equally acceptable projections.

       The  projected Klein bottle can then be projected to the screen either perspectively or orthographically.
       When using the walking modes, perspective projection to the screen should be used.

       There  are  three  display  modes  for  the  Klein  bottle:  mesh  (wireframe),  solid,  or  transparent.
       Furthermore,  the  appearance  of  the  Klein  bottle can be as a solid object or as a set of see-through
       bands.  Finally, the colors with with the Klein bottle is drawn  can  be  set  to  one-sided,  two-sided,
       rainbow, or depth.  In one-sided mode, the Klein bottle is drawn with the same color on both "sides."  In
       two-sided  mode  (using static colors), the Klein bottle is drawn with red on one "side" and green on the
       "other side."  Of course, the Klein bottle only has one side, so the color jumps from red to green  along
       a  curve  on the surface of the Klein bottle.  This mode enables you to see that the Klein bottle is non-
       orientable.  If changing colors are used in two-sided mode, changing complementary colors are used on the
       respective "sides."  The rainbow color mode (using static colors) draws the Klein  bottle  with  a  color
       wheel  of  fully  saturated rainbow colors.  If changing colors are used, the color wheel's colors change
       dynamically.  The rainbow color mode gives a very nice effect when combined with  the  see-through  bands
       mode or with the orientation markers drawn.  The depth color mode draws the Klein bottle with colors that
       are  chosen  according to the 4d "depth" of the points.  If static colors are used, this mode enables you
       to see that the figure-8 and pinched torus Klein bottles do not intersect themselves  in  4d,  while  the
       Lawson Klein bottle does intersect itself.

       The  rotation  speed for each of the six planes around which the Klein bottle rotates can be chosen.  For
       the walk-and-turn mode, only the rotation speeds around the true 4d planes are used (the xy, xz,  and  yz
       planes).

       Furthermore, in the walking modes the walking direction in the 2d base square of the Klein bottle and the
       walking speed can be chosen.

       This  program  is  somewhat  inspired  by  Thomas  Banchoff's book "Beyond the Third Dimension: Geometry,
       Computer Graphics, and Higher Dimensions", Scientific American Library, 1990.

               Project the Klein bottle from 3d to 2d using an orthographic projection.

       The  following  three  options  are mutually exclusive.  They determine how the Klein bottle is projected
       from 4d to 3d.

       <b>--projection-4d</b> <b>random</b>
               Project the Klein bottle from 4d to 3d using a random projection mode (default).

       <b>--projection-4d</b> <b>perspective</b> (Shortcut: <b>--perspective-4d</b>)
               Project the Klein bottle from 4d to 3d using a perspective projection.

       <b>--projection-4d</b> <b>orthographic</b> (Shortcut: <b>--orthographic-4d</b>)
               Project the Klein bottle from 4d to 3d using an orthographic projection.

       The following six options determine the rotation speed of  the  Klein  bottle  around  the  six  possible
       hyperplanes.   The  rotation  speed  is  measured  in  degrees  per  frame.   The speeds should be set to
       relatively small values, e.g., less than 4 in magnitude.  In walk mode, all speeds are ignored.  In walk-
       and-turn mode, the 3d rotation speeds are ignored (i.e., the wx, wy, and wz  speeds).   In  walk-and-turn
       mode,  smaller  speeds must be used than in the turn mode to achieve a nice visualization.  Therefore, in
       walk-and-turn mode the speeds you have selected are divided by 5 internally.

       <b>--speed-wx</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the wx plane (default: 1.1).

       <b>--speed-wy</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the wy plane (default: 1.3).

       <b>--speed-wz</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the wz plane (default: 1.5).

       <b>--speed-xy</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the xy plane (default: 1.7).

       <b>--speed-xz</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the xz plane (default: 1.9).

       <b>--speed-yz</b> <u>float</u>
               Rotation speed around the yz plane (default: 2.1).

       The following two options determine the walking speed and direction.

       <b>--walk-direction</b> <u>float</u>
               The walking direction is measured as an angle  in  degrees  in  the  2d  square  that  forms  the
               coordinate system of the surface of the Klein bottle (default: 7.0).

       <b>--walk-speed</b> <u>float</u>
               The walking speed is measured in percent of some sensible maximum speed (default: 20.0).

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTION</b></h4><pre>
       If  you run this program in standalone mode in its turn mode, you can rotate the Klein bottle by dragging
       the mouse while pressing the left mouse button.  This rotates the Klein bottle in 3D,  i.e.,  around  the
       wx,  wy, and wz planes.  If you press the shift key while dragging the mouse with the left button pressed
       the Klein bottle is rotated in 4D, i.e., around the xy, xz, and yz planes.  To examine the  Klein  bottle
       at  your  leisure,  it is best to set all speeds to 0.  Otherwise, the Klein bottle will rotate while the
       left mouse button is not pressed.  This kind of interaction is not available in the two walk modes.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> to get the default host and display number.

       <b>XENVIRONMENT</b>
               to get the  name  of  a  resource  file  that  overrides  the  global  resources  stored  in  the
               RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

       <b>XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW</b>
               The window ID to use with <u>--root</u>.
