</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       flcheckers - the fltk checkers game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Checkers</u>  is  a FLTK-based version of the game of checkers.  The game is played on an 8x8 board with each
       player starting with 12 pieces or "checkers" on opposite sides of the board. The computer plays the white
       checkers in this version of the game.

       The object of the game is to remove all of your opponents' pieces.  Players  move  one  of  their  pieces
       diagonally forward on each move, either a single space or by "jumping" an adjacent piece. Your opponents'
       pieces  are  removed by jumping them - you can make multiple jumps in a single turn. You <u>must</u> jump if you
       can!

       If a piece reaches the other side of the board, it is converted to a "king" which can move both  forwards
       and backwards.
