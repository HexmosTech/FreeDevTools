</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gtkballs - A simple logic game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gtkballs</b> [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page documents <b>GtkBalls.</b>  <b>GtkBalls</b> is a simple logic game. The goal of this game is to make
       the highest score by matching a number of balls of the same color in a horizontal, vertical  or  diagonal
       line. For further information on how to play this game refer to the rules section in this manual page.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>--display</u> <u>[hostname:dpy]</u>
              Specify  what  display  GtkBalls  should  use.  See  <b>X</b>  (1x) for more information on the syntax of
              hostname and display.

</pre><h4><b>RULES</b></h4><pre>
       The standard play area of GtkBalls is a 9x9 grid (it can be changed  through  "Rules"  option  in  ingame
       menu).  When GtkBalls is first started a number of balls are placed in a random manner on the grid. Balls
       are in different colors (and/or shape). You may move balls on the grid by selecting them and selecting an
       empty square on the grid as destination for the ball you selected. Balls will only move if they  are  not
       blocked  by  other  balls. Each time you move a ball, unless you score some points, new balls appear in a
       random manner on the grid. If the grid is full then the game is lost. However this is  bound  to  happen,
       your goal is to make the highest score. In order to do this you must make lines in a vertical, horizontal
       or diagonal way with balls of the same color. By default a line must have at least five balls of the same
       color  (it can also be changed through "Rules" option in ingame menu). Making a line of minimum amount of
       the balls, specified in rules, will earn you twice the points for your score.  If  you  make  lines  over
       minimum amount of the balls it will earn you even more points. In order to help you decide which ball you
       are  going  to  move, there is an indicator on top of the grid that shows what colors the next balls that
       will appear on the grid will be.
