       monop — Monopoly game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>monop</b> [<u>file</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>monop</b> is reminiscent of the Parker Brother's game Monopoly, and monitors a game between 1 to 9 users.  It
       is assumed that the rules of Monopoly are known.  The game follows the standard rules, with the exception
       that,  if  a  property goes up for auction and there are only two solvent players, no auction is held and
       the property remains unowned.  <b>monop</b> The game, in effect, lends the player money, so it  is  possible  to
       buy  something  which  you  cannot afford.  However, as soon as a person goes into debt, he must “fix the
       problem”, i.e., make himself solvent, before play can continue.  If this is not  possible,  the  player's
       property  reverts  to  his  debtee,  either a player or the bank.  A player can resign at any time to any
       person or the bank, which puts the property back on the board, unowned.

       Any time that the response to a question is a <u>string</u>, e.g., a name, place or person, you can type ‘<b>?</b>’  to
       get a list of valid answers.  It is not possible to input a negative number, nor is it ever necessary.

       <u>A</u> <u>Summary</u> <u>of</u> <u>Commands</u>:

       <b>quit</b>  quit game: This allows you to quit the game.  It asks you if you're sure.

       <b>print</b>
             print  board:  This  prints out the current board.  The columns have the following meanings (column
             headings are the same for the <b>where</b>, <b>own</b> <b>holdings</b>, and <b>holdings</b> commands):

             Name    The first ten characters of the name of the square.
             Own     The <u>number</u> of the owner of the property.
             Price   The cost of the property (if any).
             Mg      This field has a ‘*’ in it if the property is mortgaged.
             #       If the property is a Utility or Railroad, this is the number of such owned  by  the  owner.
                     If the property is land, this is the number of houses on it.
             Rent    Current rent on the property.  If it is not owned, there is no rent.

       <b>where</b>
             where players are: Tells you where all the players are.  A ‘*’ indicates the current player.

       <b>own</b> <b>holdings</b>
             List your own holdings, i.e., money, get-out-of-jail-free cards, and property.

       <b>holdings</b>
             holdings  list:  Look  at  anyone's  holdings.  It will ask you whose holdings you wish to look at.
             When you are finished, type ‘<b>done</b>’.

       <b>mortgage</b>
             mortgage property: Sets up a list of mortgageable property, and asks which you wish to mortgage.

       <b>unmortgage</b>
             unmortgage property: Unmortgage mortgaged property.

       <b>buy</b>   buy houses: Sets up a list of monopolies on which you can buy houses.  If there is more  than  one,
             it  asks  you  which  you  want  to buy for.  It then asks you how many for each piece of property,
             giving the current amount in parentheses after the property name.  If you build  in  an  unbalanced
             manner  (a  disparity  of  more  than  one house within the same monopoly), it asks you to re-input
             things.

       <b>sell</b>  sell houses: Sets up a list of monopolies from which you  can  sell  houses.   It  operates  in  an
             analogous manner to <b>buy</b>.

       <b>card</b>  card  for  jail: Use a get-out-of-jail-free card to get out of jail.  If you're not in jail, or you
             don't have one, it tells you so.

       <b>pay</b>   pay for jail: Pay $50 to get out of jail, from whence you are put on Just Visiting.   Difficult  to
             do if you're not there.

       <b>trade</b>
             This  allows  you  to trade with another player.  It asks you whom you wish to trade with, and then
             asks you what each wishes to give up.  You can get a summary at the end, and, in all cases, it asks
             for confirmation of the trade before doing it.

       <b>resign</b>
             Resign to another player or the bank.  If you resign to the  bank,  all  property  reverts  to  its
             virgin state, and get-out-of-jail-free cards revert to the deck.

       <b>save</b>  save  game:  Save  the  current game in a file for later play.  You can continue play after saving,
             either by adding the file in which you saved the game after the <b>monop</b>  command,  or  by  using  the
             <b>restore</b>  command  (see below).  It will ask you which file you wish to save it in, and, if the file
             exists, confirm that you wish to overwrite it.

       <b>restore</b>
             restore game: Read in a previously saved game from a file.  It leaves the file intact.

       <b>roll</b>  Roll the dice and move forward to your new location.  If you simply hit the ⟨RETURN⟩ key instead of
             a command, it is the same as typing <b>roll</b>.
