</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Biniax2 - Logic game with arcade and tactics modes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>biniax2</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Biniax</b>  <b>2</b>  is an original and entertaining game. It takes a minute to learn and gives you hours and hours
       of gameplay. There are three game modes (two singleplayer and one multiplayer),  hall  of  fame,  dynamic
       music and a nice cartoon look.

       Playing  the  game  is  really  simple:  you move a single tile around a field of pairs of tiles. You can
       remove a pair from the game board if one of the tiles is similar to your own. When you do that, your tile
       changes into the other tile that was part of the pair you just removed. You  have  to  do  this  quickly,
       otherwise the pairs will pile on top of you and take you to the Game Over screen.
