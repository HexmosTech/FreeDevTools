</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       QTads - Multimedia interpreter for TADS games

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>qtads</b> <b>[</b> <u>game-file</u> <b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>QTads</b>  is  an  interpreter  that can run games written in TADS. TADS is a programming language written by
       Michael J. Roberts, designed to implement text-adventure games (Interactive Fiction),  similar  to  those
       developed  by Infocom in 1980-1990, as well as other companies (like Legend Entertainment, Level 9, etc).
       If you liked games like "Zork", "Adventure", "Trinity", or "Eric the Unready", you'll feel right at home.

       This version of QTads supports both TADS versions in use today; traditional TADS 2 as  well  as  the  new
       TADS  3 format. It runs on a variety of systems, including MS Windows and every Unix system for which the
       Qt library is available, including Linux and Mac OSX.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       With no arguments, QTads will by default ask you for a filename, unless this prompting has been  disabled
       in the configuration dialog.

       The optional <u>filename</u> can be used to start a game immediately.

</pre><h4><b>LICENSE</b></h4><pre>
       QTads  is  a  Free  program, dual-licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) as well as the HTML
       TADS Freeware Source Code License.  See the file COPYING (included in the package of the program), or the
       "Help-&gt;About" menu for details.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       This program is written and maintained by Nikos Chantziaras &lt;<a href="mailto:realnc@gmail.com">realnc@gmail.com</a>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The reference implementation of the TADS VM was done by Mike Roberts. Several people helped making  QTads
       a better program. See the file CREDITS or the "Help-&gt;About" menu for a list of names.
