</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       AisleRiot accepts the following options, besides the usual Gtk+/GNOME switches:

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--variation=NAME</b>
              Select the game to play

       <b>--display=DISPLAY</b>
              X display to use

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       This text is taken verbatim from the AisleRiot Manual V2.12.

       Moving the cards is reasonably obvious. Assuming you have a right-handed mouse, left-click on a card  and
       drag it somewhere. Release the mouse button to deposit the card.

       If  a  card can be moved to the foundation(s), you do not need to drag it. You can double-click on it and
       it will move. If a sequence of cards can be moved to the foundations, you can generally move the sequence
       as one move.

       Double clicking a card will send it to a foundation, if that is possible. This is useful for cleaning  up
       large numbers of cards at the end of a successful game.

       In games which have a stock pile you can redeal it by clicking on the empty space where it was. Be warned
       that  some games only let you do this a limited number of time. Watch for the Redeals Left message at the
       bottom of the window.

       A useful tip to know is that right-clicking on a face-up card which is partially obscured by a card  laid
       over it will raise it so that you can see what it is.

       There is an alternative way to move cards. By selecting <b>Click</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> from the <b>Control</b> menu you can click
       once  to  pick  up a card and then click again to place it.  This can be faster than dragging and will be
       easier on your hand since you don't have to hold the mouse down. However, it may take a while to get used
       to.

       Some games have options to change the way the game is played. For example Klondike  can  be  played  with
       either  single  card  deals  or three-card deals. In these games there is a separate menu with the game's
       name. You can only change the rules of the game at the beginning of the game -- the menu will be inactive
       during the game.

       Statistics on how well you have done at a particular game are available by selecting <b>Statistics</b> from  the
       Game menu. Only games where you actually start moving cards are counted. The statistics are here for your
       own enjoyment, there are numerous ways to cheat and it is unwise to make comparisons.
