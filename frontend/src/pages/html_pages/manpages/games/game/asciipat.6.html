</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       asciipat - A retro ASCII art game inspired by Moon Patrol.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>asciipat</b> [option] [.rec file]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>asciipat</b>  is a command-line game that brings back the nostalgia of retro ASCII art games.  It is inspired
       by the classic Moon Patrol game.  Guide your character through a treacherous terrain, avoiding  obstacles
       and shooting down enemies.  Survive as long as possible to achieve a high score.

       After  finishing game you may notice there is “asciipat.rec” file in your home directory.  It can be used
       to replay game or to validate your score.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program  does  not  have  a
       manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in the GNU <a href="../man1/info.1.html">info</a>(1) format; see below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>0</b> [.rec file]
              Score validation (no graphics) - this is used by hi-scores server.

              Time lapsed (fast) playback.

       <b>2</b> [.rec file]
              Normal playback - Used it to capture videos.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       ${HOME}/asciipat.cfg
              This file is created when you change your player name, avatar, or key bindings.

       ${HOME}/asciipat.rec
              This file is created when you start playing the game, and get a score.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ASCII_PATROL_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              If  used,  the  defined  directory  is used to store the asciipat.cfg (see also the section called
              “FILES”).

       <b>ASCII_PATROL_RECORD_DIR</b>
              If used, the defined directory is used to store the asciipat.rec  (see  also  the  section  called
              “FILES”).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  is currently limited to workaround some issues please refer to the following upstream Prob‐
       lems section at https://github.com/msokalski/ascii-patrol/tree/1.7#problems
