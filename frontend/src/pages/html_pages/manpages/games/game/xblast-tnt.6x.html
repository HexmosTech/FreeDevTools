</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XBlast (TNT) - Multi-player "Blast the Others" game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xblast-tnt</b>  <u>[options]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       XBlast  is  a multi-player arcade game for X11R5/R6. The game can be played with at least two players and
       up to six players. It was inspired by the video/computer  game  Bomberman/Dynablaster  which  was  to  my
       knowledge  first  programmed for NEC's PC Engine/Turbo Grafx. Other (commercial) versions of the original
       game exist for IBM-PC, Atari ST, Amiga, NES, GameBoy and Super NES.

</pre><h4><b>Actualized</b> <b>information</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>web</b> <b>page:</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="http://xblast.sourceforge.net/">http://xblast.sourceforge.net/</a> Follow the link Player-Tutorials

</pre><h4><b>LAUNCHING</b> <b>XBLAST</b></h4><pre>
       Just type xblast-tnt in an xconsole.

</pre><h4><b>SOUND</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This option is only valid when <u>XBlast</u> was compiled with the optional sound support.  Freebsd,  Linux  and
       Sun should be supported.

       <b>-ns</b>    This disables the sound support.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The program <u>XBlast</u> supports the following command-line options:

       <b>-central</b>
              This option starts the program as central server.

       <b>-check</b> This option verifies if all levels are loadable.

</pre><h4><b>PLAYING</b> <b>XBLAST</b></h4><pre>
       The  idea  of the game is quite simple: "There can be only one ...".  So the aim is to blast away all the
       other players. Use your bombs to blast away the other players and certain blocks (e.g.  the  ?-Blocks  in
       the 1st level). Below some of these blocks there are extras.

       The  program  <u>XBlast</u>  can  be  played locally or in network.  After you started <u>XBlast</u> it will display an
       intro. The next step will show you the "Main Menu". In the "Main Menu" you can  decide  if  you  want  to
       start a local game, join a network game or host a network game. For detailed information please go to the
       web site.

</pre><h4><b>CONTROLS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  will  explain  the default bindings.  These keys control the first (right) player at your
       display:

              Player starts walking up.

       <u>KP_2</u>, <u>KP_Down</u>

       <u>Escape</u> Go to previous menu.

       Please note that since <u>XBlast</u> <u>2.7.x</u> the keybindings can be customised via Options Menu Controls (see also
       https://blast.sf.net/ ).

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b> <b>SYMBOLS</b></h4><pre>
       There are many extras to be found in xblast. Most of the time they can be found under  blastable  blocks,
       sometimes  they  are  just  lying around. The following extras can be found in nearly any level. You will
       keep these extras until you have lost all your lives or the level ends. See the web site  for  actualized
       information.

       <b>Bomb</b> (red frame)
              This extra increases the number of bombs you can drop by one.

       <b>Flame</b> (yellow flame)
              This extra increases the range of your bombs by one field.

       Furthermore in several levels the following symbol can be found:

       <b>Skull</b> (cyan frame)
              This  is  not really an extra, but you will be infected with an random illness when picking it up.
              You will be healed automatically after a certain time, or if you loose one life. Additionally  you
              can infect other players while being ill by running past them.

       In  many  levels  there  is also a special extra. There will always be only one type of special extra per
       level and you will loose it if you loose a life. The following special extras can be found:

       <b>Kick</b> <b>extra</b> (moving bomb in blue frame)
              This extra enables you to kick bombs by running into them.

       <b>Invincibility</b> (star in golden frame)
              This extra makes you invincible for some time. You are not killed by explosions, stunned by moving
              bombs, nor infected by skulls.

       <b>Global</b> <b>Detonator</b> (button in deep pink frame)
              Picking up this extra ignites all bombs on the map. Use with care.

       <b>Construction</b> <b>Bombs</b> (bricks and bombs in firebrick frame)
              This extra gives you construction bombs as special bombs.  These bombs create  a  blastable  block
              when exploding. Use the special key to drop them.

       <b>Remote</b> <b>Control</b> (button box in spring green frame)
              This extra enables you to ignite all your bombs by pressing the special key.

       <b>Teleport</b> <b>Extra</b> (beaming player in orchid frame)
              This  extra enables you to beam away to a random location. You must be in the center of a block to
              activate it. Use the special key to teleport.

       <b>Airpump</b> (clouds in sky blue frame)
              This extra enables you to blow away (not to blast away) bombs within a range of 2 fields. It  also
              works when your are trapped between two bombs. Use the special key to activate it.

       <b>Napalm</b> <b>Bombs</b> (burning bombs in orange red frame)
              This  extra  allows  you to drop a high powered napalm bomb using the special key. This bomb has a
              much larger explosion than normal, and is bigger if you have more Flames. If the  bomb  is  struck
              with  an  explosion,  it  will explode as a normal bomb. For the large explosion to occur, it must
              explode on its own.

       <b>Firecrackers</b> (firecrackers in orange frame)
              This extra allows you to drop firecracker bombs with the special key.  Firecracker bombs set off a
              series of explosions that can clear away a small area.  One  in  ten  firecracker  bombs  is  high
              powered  and  clears  away  a  much  larger area. There is no way to tell if a firecracker is high
              powered or not until it explodes. Unlike napalm bombs there is no  way  to  stop  the  firecracker
              explosion, although it is blocked by walls and other solid objects.

       <b>Pyro</b> <b>bombs</b> (firecrackers in orange frame)
              This extra allows you to drop pyro bombs with the special key. Pyro bombs explode with a series of
              small  explosions  that  dance  around  the level. These explosions are blocked by walls and other
              bombs but are able to travel through corridors with ease. They  explode  randomly  and  cannot  be
              controlled. Pyro bombs have the same range irrespective of how many flame extras you have. Even if
              the bomb is struck with an explosion it will still explode as pyro bomb.

       <b>Junkie</b> <b>Virus</b> (syringe in yellow green frame)
              This  extra  infects  you with the junkie virus. Whilst you have the junkie virus you are randomly
              infected with illnesses (as if you were picking up skulls). You MUST touch other players  to  pass
              on  the illness within a certain time limit or you will lose a life. Any touched players are given
              the junkie virus as well. There is currently no way to get rid of the junkie virus (but look for a
              rehabilitation centre in the next release). :)

       <b>Poison</b> (black skull in steel blue frame)
              This extra?! cost you one of your lives. So avoid to step on it. At least if you are not currently
              invincible.

       <b>Spinner</b> (looks like normal floor)
              When picking up this extra you will be stunned for some time. Your opponents might want  to  blast
              you while you are spinning.

       <b>Speed</b> (moving head in light blue frame)
              This  extra  enables  you too run twice as fast as normal. Try to overtake other players and catch
              them between bombs.

       <b>Mayhem</b> (moving head and bomb in blue frame)
              This extra gives you speed and kicking. Make the best of it.

       <b>Holy</b> <b>Grail</b> (a grail with blue light in white frame)
              This extras transfers life energy to you from your opponents.  Be sure you  are  the  one  to  get
              there first.

       <b>Life</b> (head and first aid kit in red frame)
              This extra increases your number of lives by one. Comes in handy while in "hot" environments.

       <b>Random</b> (question mark in light blue frame)
              Picking     up    this    extra    will    give    you    one    of    the    following    extras:
              <u>Speed</u>, <u>Poison</u>, <u>Invincibility</u>, <u>Spinner</u>, <u>Air</u> <u>Pump</u> or <u>Life</u>.  Avoid it if you have only one life left.

       <b>Cloak</b> (vanishing player in violet frame)
              This extras allows you to cloak yourself using the special key.   You  become  invisible  for  all
              other players. The extras wears out after a certain time of use.

       <b>Morph</b> (bomb with eyes in green frame)
              Get  this  extra  to morph into a bomb with the special key. You still move as a bomb although you
              cannot alter course while on the run.  You cannot be harmed by explosions while you  are  a  bomb.
              Beware not to be kicked in the wall while the level shrinks.
