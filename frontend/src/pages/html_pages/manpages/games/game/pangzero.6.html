</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pangzero - action game that involves popping balloons with a harpoon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pangzero</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pang  Zero  is  a  clone  and  enhancement  of Super Pang, a fast-paced action game that involves popping
       balloons with a harpoon.

       The intention is to create a fun, open-source game  that  many  (currently  up  to  6)  people  can  play
       together. You can play Pang Zero alone, but it's a lot more fun to play with your friends.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  purpose  of  the game is to destroy balls using a harpoon. When those balls are hit, they will split
       into two smaller balls until they are totally destroyed. There are also some  special  balls  which  will
       appear during the game.

       Right  after  starting  the game you will have a menu available, in which you will be able to select some
       playing options. You can use cursor keys to navigate through menuoptions and use Enter to select one. 'P'
       key pauses the game, and Esc quits.

       In that menu, you can select the number of players (between 1 and 6), Select some game options, like turn
       the sound or the music on and off, or switch between fullscreen, windowed screen or widescreen.  You  can
       also select the keys for the players.

       There's a tutorial available through the starting menu, that you can use to learn how to play.
