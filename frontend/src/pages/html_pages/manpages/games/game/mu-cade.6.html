</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mu-cade - chase action game

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Physics Centipede Invasion Smashup waggly shmup, 'Mu-cade'

       Mu-cade  is  another  shoot-em-up  game  by Kenta Cho. In this game Kenta has introduced physics into his
       formula of hardcore shooting games. Similar in some ways to Asteroids and Nibbles, the playing area is  a
       rectangular  arena  in  which vessel-snakes have only one idea at the head: expelling the others into the
       vacuum. You incarnate one of them, and you'll quickly  realize  the  subtlety  of  the  goal:  your  tail
       lengthens as you destroy your enemies.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>-brightness</b> <b>n</b>
