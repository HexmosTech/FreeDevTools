</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lure - classic 2D point and click fantasy adventure game

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Lure  of  the  Temptress  was  Revolution's  very first adventure game and work began on it in 1989, even
       before Revolution's inception as an actual games development company.

       You are Diermot, an unwilling hero who'd prefer a quiet life, and are, to all  intents  and  purposes,  a
       good  man.  After  decades  of unrest the King has united the warring factions in his kingdom and all his
       lands are at peace, except a remote region around a town called Turnvale. A  revolt  has  recently  taken
       place in Turnvale, a revolt orchestrated by an apprentice sorceress called Selena, the titular temptress.

       The  king  calls together his finest horsemen and heads off (with you in tow) to Turnvale just to witness
       how hellish mercenary monsters called Skorl are invading the town.

       The king's men are defeated, the king is killed and you fall of your horse and bang your head heavily  on
       the  ground.  You have been unconscious for a while when you realize that you are in a dingy cell guarded
       by a not so friendly Skorl. Maybe it would be an idea to try and escape...
