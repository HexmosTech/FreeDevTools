</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       netPanzer - an online multiplayer tactical warfare game

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>netpanzer</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is a free (GPL) isometric view real-time tactical game designed for play across the Internet
       and over LAN systems. One on one games are  possible via direct connect or modem.

       netPanzer  is  designed  for  FAST ACTION combat -- it is not another resource management clone. In fact,
       there aren't any resources at all. Each player will have many units of different types at their disposal.
       Players can fight until their units are destroyed -- then respawn and keep on going.

       The game is real-time, but it's based on quick tactical action  and  unit  management.  Battles  progress
       quickly  and  constantly;  in fact, they never let up. There is no stop in the action because there is no
       waiting for resources to be collected and converted into weaponry. Players can join or leave  multiplayer
       games at any time.
