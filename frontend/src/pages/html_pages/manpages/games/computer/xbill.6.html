</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xbill - save your computers from Wingdows [TM] virus

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xbill</b> <b>[-l</b> <u>level</u><b>]</b> <b>[--gui</b> <u>gui</u><b>]</b> <b>[--size</b><u>size</u><b>]</b> <b>[-v]</b> <b>[-h]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Ever  get  the  feeling  that nothing is going right?  You're a sysadmin, and someone's trying to destroy
       your computers.  The little people running around the screen are trying to  infect  your  computers  with
       Wingdows  [TM],  a  virus cleverly designed to resemble a popular operating system.  Your objective is to
       click the mouse on them, ending their potential threat.  If one of the people reaches a computer, it will
       attempt to replace your operating system with the virus it carries. It will then attempt to run  off  the
       screen  with  your  vital  software.   The  game  ends  when  only  1  (or 0) of your computers are being
       productive.  Additionally, some computers are connected with network cables.   When  one  computer  on  a
       network  becomes infected, a spark will be sent down the cable, and will infect the computer on the other
       end when it reaches there.

       Clicking the button on one of the little people will cause it to cry out in pain and  melt  (id  software
       eat your heart out!), dropping the stolen os if it is carrying one.  If a computer is running Wingdows or
       is  temporarily off, the os can be dragged back to the computer (or another computer compatible with that
       os).  To extinguish a spark, drag the bucket of water from the upper left corner onto it.

       The status bar at the bottom tells the following:
               Number of Bills on/off the screen
               Number of Computers running their OS/off/Wingdows
               Level
               Score
