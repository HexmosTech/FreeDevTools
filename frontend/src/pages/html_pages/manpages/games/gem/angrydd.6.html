</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       angrydd - a falling block puzzle game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       angrydd [ <b>--debug</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In  Angry,  Drunken Dwarves, you are an angry, drunken dwarf. Why are you so angry? Who knows. But you've
       decided to take your aggression out on other dwarves, by dropping gems on their heads. Lots of gems.

       You have your own supply of gems, which will slowly fall from the top of the screen. As  gems  reach  the
       bottom,  they  will land and sit in place. If you put enough gems of the same color in a rectangle shape,
       they will merge and form a crystal.

       Less common are break gems, which are circular. When you drop a break gem on a gem or crystal of the same
       color, it will destroy any gems of that color adjacent to it. Crystals are worth much more than an  equal
       number of regular gems.

       For more information, see the "How to Play" screen in the game.
