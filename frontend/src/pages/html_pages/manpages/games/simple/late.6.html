</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       late - A simple game for one player.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>late</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  documents  briefly  the  <b>late</b>  game.   This  manual  page  was written for the Debian
       distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation  in
       the GNU Info format; see below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  does  not  follow  the  usual GNU command line syntax, only long options starting with two
       dashes (`-') are supported.  A summary of options is included below.

       <b>--help</b> Show summary of options.

       <b>--version</b>
              Show version of program.

       <b>--cheat</b>
              Gives you infinite lives.

</pre><h4><b>Playing</b></h4><pre>
       Your mouse is controls a sophisticated tool against evil: basically a fancy  fancy  tube.  This  is  your
       weapon,  a savage gillotine that cuts up wallpaper with not a shred of hesitation nor remorse. It has but
       one weakness, it can only withstand a  few  impacts  with  balls....   Fortunantly  for  you,  the  evil,
       heartless  little balls also have a weakness, they can only travel across the original terrain and may be
       locked up tight by its removal.  And lock them up tight you must, for the only way to exact vengance from
       these ricocheting feinds is to choke them out of existence. Your gillotine is sharp and quick, it may  be
       shot  out  using the left button, and its orientation may be changed in ninety degree increments with the
       right, but once you fire, there is no way to stop its cutting and razing until it has made  its  cut,  or
       been  struck.   The  balls,  in  their  spherical  cunning  have  developed  many  tricks beyond just the
       contemptable bounce tactics of the simple fireball, there  are  balls  made  from  goo  that  divide  and
       disperse  when  hit and can reform in an effort to confuse their prey. There are unstable groups of three
       balls that will spontaniously explode when encapsulated tight enough. There are balls that will  teleport
       for  surprise  tactics.  And  even  cold blooded balls that will be towards the cutters whenever they are
       seen.

       You must fight these crewl balls, and you must prevail!

</pre><h4><b>WEBSITE</b></h4><pre>
       The game has a website accessible at <a href="http://late.sourceforge.net/">http://late.sourceforge.net/</a>

       The programs are documented fully by <u>The</u> <u>Rise</u> <u>and</u> <u>Fall</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>Fooish</u> <u>Bar</u>, available via the Info system.
