</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board, make_pysol_freecell_board.py - Programs to generate boards to be used
       as input to Freecell Solver.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board</b> <u>[-t]</u> <u>board-number</u>

       or for make_pysol_freecell_board.py:

       <b>make_pysol_freecell_board.py</b> <u>[-t]</u> <u>[-F]</u> <u>[--ms]</u> <u>board-number</u> [<u>game-string</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These programs are command-line programs that can generate the <u>initial</u> board of the games of several
       popular Solitaire implementations. Those boards can be in turn be input to <b>fc-solve</b> by means of a
       pipeline, or placed inside a file for safe-keeping.

       <b>make_pysol_freecell_board.py</b> also accepts an optional third argument which indicates the game variants.
       This type defaults to Freecell, but is useful for generating the boards of other games. Note that using
       this flag still requires one to use the "--game" flag of <b>fc-solve</b>, if necessary.

       <b>make_pysol_freecell_board.py</b> also accepts a flag called <u>-F</u> or <u>--pysolfc</u> that deals the PySolFC boards
       instead of the classic PySol ones, and one called <u>--ms</u> or <u>-M</u> that deals Microsoft Freecell/Freecell Pro
       deals even for higher seeds.

       A common paradigm for using those programs is something like:

           bash:~$ pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board -t 11982 | fc-solve -l gi

       If the "-t" option is specified, then the 10 cards are printed with "T"'s, instead of "10"'s. While <b>fc-</b>
       <b>solve</b> can accept either as input, it may prove useful for other solvers or solitaire implementations
       which do not accept "10"'s.

       Here is a short description of each program:

       <b>make_pysol_freecell_board.py</b>

       A Python script that generates the boards of the various games of PySol.

       <b>pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board</b>

       A program that generates the boards of Microsoft Freecell and of the Freecell Pro implementation of
       Freecell.
