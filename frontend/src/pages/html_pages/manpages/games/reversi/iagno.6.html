       GNOME Reversi - A disk flipping strategy board game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>iagno</b> [<u>OPTION...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Reversi is a two-player strategy game, played on an 8 by 8 board.  Players use tiles that are dark on one
       side and light on the other.

       The  object  of  reversi is to flip your opponent’s tiles to your color, while your opponent is trying to
       flip your tiles to his own color.  Opponent’s tiles are flipped when trapped between  an  already  placed
       tile of your color and the tile you add. Who finishes with more tiles wins!

       GNOME Reversi allows you to play both a classic reversi game, and the reversed variant, where the goal is
       to finish with less tile than your opponent.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--alternative-start</b>
       <b>--random-start</b>
       <b>--usual-start</b>
              Reversi can be played with two different initial positions.
              The options --usual-start and --alternative-start permit to directly choose which initial position
              will be used.
              The option --random-start is for choosing one randomly.
              The three options disable setting the mode from the window.
              You should only use one of these options at the same time.

       <b>--classic</b>
       <b>--reverse</b>
              GNOME Reversi includes two games played with the same mechanisms.
              The option --classic challenges to finish with more pieces.
              The option --reverse challenges to finish with less pieces.
              You should only use one of these options at the same time.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--fast-moves</b>
              Play with reduced delay before the computer moves.

       <b>--first</b>
       <b>--second</b>
       <b>--two-players</b>
              Sets the game mode.
              The  options  --first  and --second are for a one-player game, where the player plays respectively
              first and second.
              The option --two-players is for a two-players game mode.
              You should only use one of these options at the same time.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Prints the command line options and exits.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--level=&lt;level&gt;</b>
              Changes the computer's AI level (1-3).
              1 is the easiest, 2 is good, 3 is the hardest.

       <b>--mute</b>
       <b>--unmute</b>
              Turn off/on the sound.
              If the two options are given, the game is muted.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--size=&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Changes the size of the board. The size must be at least 4.
              This option is for debugging only. The AI may not perform optimally.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Prints the program version and exits.

       This program also accepts the standard GTK+ options.
