</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cribbage — the card game cribbage

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cribbage</b> [<b>-eqr</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cribbage</b>  plays  the  card  game cribbage, with the program playing one hand and the user the other.  The
       program will initially ask the user if the rules of the game are needed – if so, it will  print  out  the
       appropriate section from <u>According</u> <u>to</u> <u>Hoyle</u> with <u><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></u>(1).

       <b>cribbage</b> options include:

       <b>-e</b>      When  the  player makes a mistake scoring his hand or crib, provide an explanation of the correct
               score.  (This is especially useful for beginning players.)

       <b>-q</b>      Print a shorter form of all messages – this is only recommended for users  who  have  played  the
               game without specifying this option.

       <b>-r</b>      Instead of asking the player to cut the deck, the program will randomly cut the deck.

       <b>cribbage</b>  first  asks the player whether he wishes to play a short game ( “once around”, to 61) or a long
       game ( “twice around”, to 121).  A response of ‘<b>s</b>’ will result in a short game, any other  response  will
       play a long game.

       At  the  start  of  the first game, the program asks the player to cut the deck to determine who gets the
       first crib.  The user should respond with a number between 0 and 51, indicating how many cards  down  the
       deck is to be cut.  The player who cuts the lower ranked card gets the first crib.  If more than one game
       is played, the loser of the previous game gets the first crib in the current game.

       For  each hand, the program first prints the player's hand, whose crib it is, and then asks the player to
       discard two cards into the crib.  The cards are prompted for one per line, and  are  typed  as  explained
       below.

       After  discarding,  the  program cuts the deck (if it is the player's crib) or asks the player to cut the
       deck (if it's its crib); in the latter case, the appropriate response is a number from 0 to 39 indicating
       how far down the remaining 40 cards are to be cut.

       After cutting the deck, play starts with the non-dealer (the person who doesn't have  the  crib)  leading
       the first card.  Play continues, as per cribbage, until all cards are exhausted.  The program keeps track
       of the scoring of all points and the total of the cards on the table.

       After play, the hands are scored.  The program requests the player to score his hand (and the crib, if it
       is  his)  by  printing out the appropriate cards (and the cut card enclosed in brackets).  Play continues
       until one player reaches the game limit (61 or 121).

       A carriage return when a numeric input is expected is equivalent to typing the lowest legal  value;  when
       cutting the deck this is equivalent to choosing the top card.

       Cards  are specified as rank followed by suit.  The ranks may be specified as one of: ‘a’, ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘4’,
       ‘5’, ‘6’, ‘7’, ‘8’, ‘9’, ‘t’, ‘j’, ‘q’, and ‘k’, or alternatively, one of: ‘ace’, ‘two’, ‘three’, ‘four’,
       ‘five’, ‘six’, ‘seven’, ‘eight’, ‘nine’, ‘ten’, ‘jack’, ‘queen’, and ‘king’.  Suits may be specified  as:
       ‘s’,  ‘h’, ‘d’, and ‘c’, or alternatively as: ‘spades’, ‘hearts’, ‘diamonds’, and ‘clubs’.  A card may be
       specified as: “⟨rank⟩   ⟨suit⟩”, or: “⟨rank⟩ of ⟨suit⟩”.  If the single letter rank and suit designations
       are used, the space separating the suit and rank may be left out.  Also, if only one card of the  desired
       rank  is playable, typing the rank is sufficient.  For example, if your hand was “2H, 4D, 5C, 6H, JC, and
       KD” and it was desired to discard the king of diamonds, any of the following could be typed: ‘k’, ‘king’,
       ‘kd’, ‘k d’, ‘k of d’, ‘king d’, ‘king of d’, ‘k diamonds’, ‘k of diamonds’, ‘king  diamonds’,  ‘king  of
       diamonds’.
