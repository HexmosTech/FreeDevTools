</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ceferino - action game similar to Super Pang

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ceferino</b> <b>ceferinosetup</b> <b>ceferinoeditor</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The game is similar to 'Super Pang'.

       You  are attacked by little green balls which are bouncing around and which you have to destroy with your
       knife. Your knife, however, is limited to being thrown upwards, so you have to get  under  the  balls  to
       destroy them.

       Even worse, if you destroy a large ball, it doesn't just vanish, but breaks apart into two smaller balls.
       Levels  consist  of  little  platforms  connected  by ladders, so you can go up and down or find cover if
       needed.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ceferinosetup</b>

       With this program you can configure the game options: video mode, full screen or windowed mode, music and
       sounds. The configuration is stored in $HOME/.ceferino

       You can move through the menu using the arrow keys, return and space.

       <b>ceferino</b>

       This command allows to run the game. It will get the game options from $HOME/.ceferino and, after a brief
       introduction, will present a menu in which you can select a new game and some other things.

       During the game, you can use the following keys:
            Left Arrow - Move Left
            Right Arrow - Move Right
            x - Throw a knife
            z and c - Roll on the floor
            Up Arrow - Climb Stairs
            Down Arrow - Crouch

       The purpose of the game is to destroy all the balls and go up levels without being killed.

       The highest scores are stored in $HOME/.ceferinomarcas

       <b>ceferinoeditor</b>

       With this program you can edit the levels of the game. The data describing the new levels will be  stored
       in $HOME/.ceferinoniveles.map

       You can use the mouse to modify the map.
