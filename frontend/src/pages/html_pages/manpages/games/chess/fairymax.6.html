       fairymax - xboard-compatible chess and chess-variant engine 'Fairy-Max'

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fairymax</b> [hashSize] [iniFile]

       <b>shamax</b> [hashSize] [iniFile]

       <b>maxqi</b> [hashSize] [iniFile]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fairymax</b> is a program that plays chess and chess variants.  It uses the xboard/winboard chess-engine
       protocol to communicate.  Apart from 'regular' chess (also known as the Mad-Queen variant), it can play
       Capablanca chess, gothic chess, janus chess, knightmate, cylinder chess, berolina chess, superchess,
       makruk (Thai chess, and also some of its variants, Cambodian chess (Ouk), asean chess and ai-wok),
       courier chess, Seirawan chess, Spartan chess, falcon chess, great shatranj, team-mate chess, charge of
       the light brigade, king of the hill, bifurcator chess, Los-Alamos chess, Mexican chess, Ciccolini's
       chess, grande acedrex, wildebeest chess (almost), shuffle chess without castling and chess with different
       armies (all combinations of the FIDE, Clobberers, Nutters and Rookies armies).  Fairy-Max can be easily
       configured by the user to play other variants as well, by modifying the ini file.  This ini file
       describes the rules of movement of the participating pieces and the initial board setup.

       Fairy-Max can also play shatranj, but in this case is not aware of the shatranj rule that a bare king
       loses.  So it might play sub-optimally in the late end-game.  A version of Fairy-Max adapted to implement
       the baring rule (and the rule that stalemate is a win) is available under the name <b>shamax</b>.  Grande
       Acedrex and Courier Chess might also have had a baring rule, so you may want to play these with shamax
       instead of fairymax too.

       Similarly, a version of Fairy-Max adapted to play Xiang Qi (Chinese Chess) is included in the fairymax
       package as well, under the name <b>maxqi</b>.

       <b>fairymax</b> is a derivative of the world's (once) smallest chess program (source-code wise), micro-Max.  The
       latter measures less that 2000 characters, (about 100 code lines), and has a computer rating of around
       2050 on the CCRL rating list.  Although this is about 1000 rating points behind the world champion,
       micro-Max still makes a quite tough opponent even for club players, although it is not unbeatable.

       The main difference between micro-Max and Fairy-Max is that the latter loads its move-generator tables,
       which specify how the various pieces move, from an external file, so it can be easily adapted to
       incorporate un-orthodox pieces.  For ease of use of the artificial-intelligence, Fairy-Max is equipped
       with I/O routines that allow it to run with the xboard graphical user interface.

       See <b><a href="../man6/xboard.6.html">xboard</a></b>(6) for instructions about how to use <b>fairymax</b> through xboard. To start up quickly, you just
       need the command: <b>xboard</b> <b>-fcp</b> <b>fairymax</b>.  Note that to be able to play the chess variants, it is
       recommended to use the latest XBoard version, as some of the recently added variants will use features
       not supported by older XBoard versions (in particular allowing an engine to reconfigure XBoard's ideas on
       the initial setup and how the pieces move).  Problems with older XBoard versions might range from only
       being able to play the variant with legality testing switched off, inability to display some of the
       unorthodox pieces in board sizes other than <b>Bulky</b>, <b>Middling</b> or <b>Petite</b>, not recognizing variants with non-
       standard names, to refusing even names that by now are standard XBoard variants.

       For some variants even the name is unknown to XBoard, and they are all grouped under the catchall name
       'fairy'.  Which variant is played by Fairy-Max when XBoard is set to 'fairy', can be determined by a
       combobox control in the XBoard 'Engine Settings' menu dialog.  This currently applies to the various army
       combinations of chess with different armies.  After having set this <b>Variant</b> <b>fairy</b> <b>selects</b> option,
       activating XBoard's <b>New</b> <b>game</b> menu when already in variant fairy, or selecting fairy from the <b>New</b> <b>variant</b>
       menu dialog will then start the selected game.

       Fairymax supports multi-PV mode: by specifying a non-zero multi-PV margin in the Engine-Settings dialog
       of XBoard, Fairy-Max will not only print the principal variation for the best move, but also for every
       move that approaches the score of this best move to within the set margin.  (If it does not find the best
       move on the first try, this might lead to printing of a few extra lines below the threshold.)  Fairy-Max
       now also supports analysis mode, and exclusion of moves from the analysis.

       The fmax.ini file from which Fairy-Max by default takes the piece and game definitions is a self-
       documenting text file, which contains instructions for how to define new pieces and chess variants.  In
       addition it contains an extensive list of pre-defined pieces, incuding many not occurring in any of the
       pre-defined variants, which the user can draw on to define his own variants.

       Amongst the move types supported by Fairy-Max are normal leaper and slider moves, (e.g. knight and rook),
       divergent moves (i.e. capture and non-capture moves can be different), hoppers (which jump over other
       pieces, such as the Chinese cannon or the grasshopper), lame leapers (the move of which can be blocked on
       squares they cannot move to, such as the Chinese horse and elephant), limited-range sliders (upto range
       5), and any combination thereof, in every possible direction.  The board width is configurable upto a
       width of 14 files, and cylindrical boards (where left and right edge connect) are supported as well.  The
       board height can be configured up to 16 ranks.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hashSize</b>
               If  the  first  argument  to  fairymax  is numeric, it is taken as an indicator for the amount of
               memory Fairy-Max is allowed to use for its internal hash  table.   The  default  value  for  this
               argument, 22, would result in a memory usage of 48MB.  Each next-higher number doubles the memory
               usage,  each  next-lower  halves  it.   Running  with  less  than  6MB  (i.e. argument 19) is not
               recommended.  When fairymax is running under xboard 4.3.15 or later the hash-table  size  can  be
               set through the xboard menus, making this argument superfluous.

       <b>iniFile</b> A  second or non-numeric first argument is taken as a filename.  Fairy-Max will use the mentioned
               file in stead of its default fmax.ini file to define the movement of pieces and initial setup  of
               the variants.  This makes it easier to define your own variants.

       <b>INTERACTIVE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
               Fairy-Max  also  supports some options that can only be set interactively, though XBoard's engine
               settings menu dialog.  These include a setting to further  define  -variant  fairy,  (e.g.  which
               armies  to  pit  against  each other in chess with different armies), and whether makruk is to be
               played with Thai or Cambodian rules  (the  latter  requiring  XBoard's  legality  testing  to  be
               switched  off!).   You  can  also  enable resigning, and set a score threshold for when Fairy-Max
               should do it, and define the already mentioned multi-PV margin there.  An 'Info'  button  in  the
               settings dialog makes XBoard pop up a window with some info about the currently selected variant.

       <b>Persistent</b> <b>hash</b>
               Some  of  the interactive options can be used to store the current position in a file bearing the
               name of the variant being played, with the  extension  '.hash'  added  to  it,  during  analysis.
               Positions  in  that  file  will be loaded into Fairy-Max' hash table before every game, protected
               from overwrite.  This can be used to create an opening or end-game book  for  the  variant.   The
               <b>Save</b>  <b>in</b>  <b>hash</b>  <b>file</b>  button  is  convenient for saving the occasional position.  For saving many
               positions in a row the option <b>Automatic</b> <b>pesistent-hash</b> <b>dialog</b> can be  ticked.   This  pops  up  a
               dialog  at  the  start of every analysis search, in which the user then just has to press 'OK' to
               put the score from the analysis into the hash file.  If a number is typed in that  dialog  before
               pressing  'OK',  the position will be saved with that score (in centi-Pawn) rather than the score
               determined by the engine's own analysis.  This can for instance be  used  to  discourage  opening
               lines  the engine overrates.  The file will be created in the current directory, but at the start
               of a game both this file, as well as one in Fairy-Max' private data files, will be  loaded.   The
               install does contain such a persistent hash file for makruk, to help Fairy-Max find the checkmate
               in the 'difficult' corners of the KMMMK and KNMMK (with like M) end-games.
