</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       glaurung - free UCI chess engine, to calculate chess moves

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>glaurung</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents the <b>glaurung</b> command.

       <b>glaurung</b> is an UCI chess engine, to calculate chess moves

       Opening book

       This  version of Glaurung has experimental support for PolyGlot opening books.  For information about how
       to create such books, consult the PolyGlot documentation.  Currently, Glaurung  requires  that  the  book
       file is named book.bin and is placed in Glaurungs working directory.

       More than one CPU

       Beginning  with  version  2-epsilon/3,  Glaurung  has  support  for up to four CPUs.  Because the program
       currently cannot automatically detect the number of CPUs on your computer, it uses only a  single  search
       thread  by  default.   If your computer has two or more CPUs (this includes dual-core CPUs like the Intel
       Core Duo or the AMD Athlon 64 X2), you should set the "Threads" UCI parameter to the number  of  CPUs  to
       obtain optimal performance.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  does  NOT  follow  the  usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two
       dashes.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Communication  with   UCI   commands   is   documented   by   "The   UCI   Communication   Protocol"   in
       /usr/share/doc/glaurung/engine-interface.txt.
