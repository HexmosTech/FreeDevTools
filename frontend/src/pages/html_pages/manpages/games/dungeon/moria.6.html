</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       moria - a dungeon game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>moria</b> [ <b>-o</b> ] [ <b>-r</b> ] [ <b>-s</b> ] [ <b>-S</b> ] [ <b>-n</b> ] [ <b>-w</b> ] [ savefile ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Moria</u>  plays a dungeon game with you.  It lets you generate a character, lets you buy equipment, and lets
       you wander in a fathomless dungeon while finding treasure and  being  attacked  by  monsters  and  fellow
       adventurers.  Typing <b>?</b>  gives you a list of commands.

       The  ultimate object of <u>moria</u> is to kill the Balrog, which dwells on the 50th level of the dungeon, 2,500
       feet underground.  Most players never even reach the Balrog, and those that do seldom live to tell  about
       it.

       For a more complete description of the game, read the document <u>The</u> <u>Dungeons</u> <u>of</u> <u>Moria.</u>

       By  default,  <u>moria</u> will save and restore games from a file called moria.save in your home directory.  If
       the environment variable MORIA_SAV is defined, then <u>moria</u> will use that file name instead of the default.
       If MORIA_SAV is not a complete path name, then the savefile will be created or restored from the  current
       directory.  You can also explicitly specify a savefile on the command line.

       If  you  use  the <b>-n</b> option, <u>moria</u> will create a new game, ignoring any savefile which may already exist.
       This works best when a savefile name is specified on the command line, as this will  prevent  <u>moria</u>  from
       trying to overwrite the default savefile (if it exists) when you try to save your game.

       You  move  in  various directions by pressing the numeric keypad keys, VMS-style.  If you specify <b>-r</b>, you
       move the same way you do in <u><a href="../man6/rogue.6.html">rogue</a></u>(6).  You can also specify <b>-o</b> to force the VMS-style command set.  These
       options will override defaults stored in the savefile.  If these options are given multiple  times,  only
       the last one will take effect.

       If you specify <b>-s</b>, <u>moria</u> prints all of the scores in the score file and exits.  On a multiuser system, if
       you specify <b>-S</b>, <u>moria</u> prints prints only those scores belonging to you and then exits.

       If  you specify <b>-w</b>, <u>moria</u> will start up in wizard mode.  You can resurrect a dead character by using this
       option when starting the game.  Resurrected characters are teleported to the town level  and  given  zero
       hitpoints.  Wizard mode is intended for debugging the game, and for experimenting with new features.  Any
       other use is considered cheating.  Games played with wizard mode are not scored.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The  original  version of Moria was written in VMS/Pascal by Robert Alan Koeneke, Jimmey Wayne Todd, Gary
       McAdoo, and others at the University of Oklahoma.   This  version  was  written  by  Jim  Wilson  at  the
       University  of  California,  Berkeley,  and  released  with  minor revisions by David Grabiner at Harvard
       University.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       A suspended game that gets a hangup signal will die without creating a save file.

       Rerolling with a % at the class prompt not implemented.

       For a more comprehensive list, see the ERRORS file in the source distribution.
