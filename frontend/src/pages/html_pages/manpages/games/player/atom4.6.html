</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       atom4 - two-player color puzzle game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>atom4</b> [ <b>-a</b> <u>n</u> ] [ <b>-d</b> <u>level</u> ] [ <b>-mt</b> | <b>-mx</b> ]
       <b>atom4</b> <b>-h</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Atom-4  is  a  two-player color manipulation game played with colored spherical pieces on a board divided
       into equilateral triangles. The player who first makes a row of 4 pieces of the right color wins.

       There is an AI mode where you play against the computer. By default, <b>atom4</b> runs in 2-player  mode.  Since
       2-player  mode  is  controlled  from  the  same terminal, it can be used as a "practice" mode to acquiant
       oneself with the color change rules or to explore strategic possibilities in a controlled way.

       <b>atom4</b> supports both a curses-based text interface and an X11 interface. The  interface  can  be  selected
       with  the <b>-m</b> option. By default, <b>atom4</b> launches the X11 interface if the <b>$DISPLAY</b> environment variable is
       set, and the curses-based interface otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b> <u>n</u>   Play against AI player.  <u>n</u> must be either 1 or 2, specifying which player the AI will be.

       <b>-d</b> <u>n</u>   Set AI player's difficulty level, where <u>n</u> is an integer from 0 or larger. The  default  difficulty
              setting is 2. This version of Atom-4 uses a real min-max algorithm; higher difficulty settings are
              actually  much harder unlike in the previous version. However, be warned that very high difficulty
              settings will likely be very slow, as the game tree grows very quickly.

       <b>-h</b>     Shows a summary of command-line options that <b>atom4</b> takes.

       <b>-mt</b>    Selects the text (curses-based) interface. The curses-based interface  requires  a  terminal  with
              color capabilities; at least 9 colors are needed.

       <b>-mx</b>    Selects  the  X11  interface. The X11 interface requires an X display that supports at least 8-bit
              color. Note that currently, <b>atom4</b> will always connect to the X server specified  in  the  <b>$DISPLAY</b>
              environment variable.

</pre><h4><b>TEXT</b> <b>MODE</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       The text mode interface requires a terminal that supports at least 9 colors.

       The  game  controls  are straightforward: the keypad arrow keys move the cursor around the board, and the
       Enter key or the Space key will place the piece being played on the board. The panel on the  right  shows
       you which piece is currently being played. Gameplay proceeds until one of the players win.

       You can press <b>q</b> at any time to quit the game.

       After  one  of the players win, the game will pause. You can either press <b>n</b> to proceed to the next round,
       or <b>q</b> to quit.

</pre><h4><b>X11</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       The X11 interface requires an X display which has at least 8-bit color.

       Gameplay on the X11 interface is simple: the color wheel in the right panel  shows  the  order  in  which
       pieces  are  played, as well as the current player (number in the center). The current piece being played
       is highlighted in the color wheel. To play the piece, simply locate your mouse over the desired  spot  on
       the board and click the mouse button.

       When  it  is  your turn to play, and your mouse hovers over a legal position where you can place a piece,
       the piece you are currently playing will appear under the mouse cursor. It is not actually placed on  the
       board until you click the mouse button.

       At any time during the game, you may press <b>q</b> to quit the game.

       After one of the players win, press <b>n</b> to proceed to the next round.

</pre><h4><b>GAME</b> <b>RULES</b></h4><pre>
       (Adapted from the README file.)

       Pieces  may  be  placed only on the vertices of the triangular game board divisions, and only if touching
       two other pieces which themselves are adjacent to each other (i.e., it must form an equilateral  triangle
       with  two  adjacent  pieces  already  on  the  board).  Theoretically,  the  board  is unlimited in size;
       practically, we limit it to 16 vertices across and 16 rows down.

       Pieces have 8 different colors in total, grouped into 4 groups:

        - black
        - red, green, and blue (the primary, or "additive", colors)
        - yellow, cyan, and purple (the secondary, or "subtractive", colors)
        - white

       Black and white are also called "propagators" (explained below).

       The first player plays additive colors, and must make a row of 4 whites. White is the "goal piece" of the
       first player.  Similarly, the second player plays subtractive colors, and must make a row  of  4  blacks.
       Black is the "goal piece" of the second player.

       Since  neither  player  can play their goal pieces directly, they need to combine the colors they play in
       order to form their goal pieces on the game board, indirectly. Whenever an additive or subtractive  piece
       is  put on the board, it changes the color of pieces surrounding it. The color changes are illustrated by
       the following color wheel:

                             red   yellow
                                \ /
                        purple --*-- green
                                / \
                            blue   cyan

       1) If the neighbouring piece has an adjacent color on the wheel, it does not change. For example, if  red
              is placed next to yellow or purple, the yellow or purple remains the same.

       2)  If  the  neighbouring piece has a color 60 degrees away on the wheel, then it changes to the color in
              between. For example, if red is placed next to green, the green turns into a yellow. If a  red  is
              placed next to a blue, the blue turns purple.

       3)  If  the  neighbouring  piece  has the opposite color on the wheel, then it changes to either white or
              black, depending on what type of color the new piece is. If the new piece is  an  additive  piece,
              the  neighbour  becomes  white;  if  it  is  a subtractive piece, the neighbour becomes black. For
              example, if a red is placed next to a cyan, the cyan turns white; but if a cyan is placed next  to
              the red, the red turns black.

       4)  If  the new piece is additive and the neighbouring piece is black, then the black changes to the same
              color as the new piece. Similarly, if the new piece is subtractive and the neighbouring  piece  is
              white, then the white changes to the same color as the new piece.

       5)  If the new piece is additive and the neighbouring piece is white, then the white does not change, but
              the color change effect "propagates" through the white to the piece behind the white.  That  piece
              then  changes  as  though  the new piece had been placed next to it. If it is also white, then the
              effect continues propagating in the same direction, in a straight line, until it  reaches  a  non-
              white  piece, and then changes that non-white piece as though the new piece was placed next to it.
              If an empty spot is reached before a non-white  piece,  then  nothing  happens.  Because  of  this
              effect, white pieces are also called "additive propagators".

       6)  Similarly,  if  the  new  piece  is subtractive and the neighbouring piece is black, the color change
              effect propagates in the direction of the black until it reaches a  non-black  piece,  which  then
              changes  as  though  the new piece had been placed next to it. Nothing happens if an empty spot is
              reached before a non-black piece. Hence, black pieces are also called "subtractive propagators".

       (Another way to understand the color changes is treat  colors  as  red,  green,  and  blue  combinations.
       Additive  colors  always  try  to "add" themselves to their neighbours: red + green = yellow (red &amp; green
       together); red + cyan (green &amp; blue) = white. Subtractive colors try to  remove  their  complement  color
       from  their  neighbours.  For example, the complement of yellow (red &amp; green) is blue; so yellow tries to
       remove blue from its neighbours. Hence, when yellow (red &amp; green) is placed next to cyan (green &amp;  blue),
       the  cyan  turns  green (loses the blue component). Similarly, when cyan (green &amp; blue) is placed next to
       white (red &amp; green &amp; blue), it removes its complement, red, from the white; so the white becomes cyan  as
       well.  In  other  words, additive colors behave like colored light, whilst subtractive colors behave like
       colored paint.)

       The initial state of the board consists of two pieces, green and purple, in  the  middle  of  the  board,
       touching  each  other.  The first player then plays a red, the second player plays a yellow, and then the
       first player plays a green, and so on, taking turns, going clockwise around the color  wheel.  The  first
       person to make a row of 4 propagators wins.

       If  the game is played in multiple rounds, the second player may start first on the second round, using a
       subtractive piece, and then the first player with the next color clockwise on the color wheel, and so on.
       The starting configuration always consists of two  pieces,  one  30  degrees  counterclockwise  from  the
       starting  color  on  the  color wheel, and the other 60 degrees clockwise; each touching the other in the
       center of the board.

</pre><h4><b>GAME</b> <b>STRATEGY</b> <b>CONSIDERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Notice that in order to get from additive colors to white, the first player must  form  secondary  colors
       and then add their complements; but the second player already plays secondary colors. So the first player
       can  make  use  of  the  pieces played by the second player to make whites, which is faster than building
       whites from scratch. Similarly, the second player plays subtractive pieces and must  first  form  primary
       colors  and  then  add  the complements to make black; but the first player already plays primary colors,
       which can be exploited to make blacks.

       This also means that when playing a piece, one should be careful not to give too much  advantage  to  the
       other player by providing material to make propagators (black or white).

       Propagators  (blacks  or  whites)  are  useful  for changing colors of pieces already blocked from direct
       access because they are surrounded by other pieces. Using propagators, you can  create  more  propagators
       from  such "buried" pieces. Strategic positioning of propagators that allow you to reach these "internal"
       pieces is key to winning the game.

       Since it is relatively easy for one's opponent to prevent one from winning by changing  the  color  of  a
       piece  intended  to  be the 4th propagator in the row of 4, a good strategy is to devise a way to have at
       least two different pieces that can serve as a 4th piece in the row. Another good strategy is to bury the
       prospective 4th piece with other non-essential pieces so that the opponent cannot easily  reach  it,  and
       have  multiple  propagator  paths to it.  Then if the opponent blocks one propagator path, another one is
       available to reach it.

       It is very useful to anticipate the color of one's subsequent piece, and plan accordingly.  For  example,
       if  the  first player is playing a red, and there are no cyans around, it is useful to place the red next
       to blue pieces, because they form purple which can be complemented by the green on the next turn. If they
       are placed next to green pieces, the result is yellow, which cannot be used until 2 turns later.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The original 2-color version of the game was developed in December 2002. It was  based  on  much  simpler
       rules (basically, each player directly plays his goal piece), but because of the very small initial state
       space  and  the  proximity  of  winning  states,  one  player always had the advantage. Several different
       starting configurations, including randomized starting states, were tried in an attempt  to  balance  the
       game, but with limited results.

       Because  of  these  limitations,  more  elaborate  versions of the game were sought.  The current 8-color
       version was first introduced in February 2003. Its main motivation was to postpone winning  states  until
       the state space has grown significantly.

       A  min-max algorithm with alpha/beta pruning was introduced to the AI player in April 2003. This replaced
       the previous, more limited algorithm which only performed well at certain search depths.

       The "4" in the name "Atom-4" refers obviously to the goal of  making  the  4-in-a-row.  The  "atom"  part
       refers  to  the similarity to atoms forming into a crystal lattice: you can't just stick an atom anywhere
       in a crystal lattice; it must fit into a "stable" position (in this case,  touching  two  other  adjacent
       "atoms"  already on the board). Also, atoms don't just stick together; chemical reactions (color changes)
       happen when they come together, and  some  chemical  changes  have  far-reaching  effects  (color  change
       propagating over whites and blacks).
