</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       robotfindskitten - help robot find kitten

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>robotfindskitten</b> [ <b>-n</b> <b>number</b> ] [ <b>-s</b> <b>seed</b> ] [ <b>-f</b> <b>filename</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In this game, you are robot ( # ).  Your job is to find kitten. This task is complicated by the existence
       of various things which are not kitten (collectively known as Non Kitten Items or NKIs). Robot must touch
       items to determine if they are kitten or not. The game ends when robot finds kitten.

       You  can move robot with the arrow keys, the EMACS keys (^N, ^P, ^B and ^F for down, up, left and right),
       the keypad keys (all 8 directions), and the nethack keys (all 8 directions; hjklyubn is left,  down,  up,
       right, up-left, up-right, down-left and down-right).

       You  can press Ctrl-L at any time to redraw the screen. You can press q at any time to quit.  A good old-
       fashioned Ctrl-C quits too.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       You can optionally specify the number of Non Kitten Items to use with the -s option. The default is 20.

       You can set the random-number seed, normally initialized from the system clock, with the -t option.  This
       may be useful for debugging.

       You can supply an arbitrary file from which to draw NKIs using the -f option.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man6/robotfindskitten.6.html">robotfindskitten</a></b>(6)    reads    all    of    the     files     in     the     <a href="file:~/.robotfindskitten">~/.robotfindskitten</a>     and
       /usr/share/games/robotfindskitten  directories.  Each  line  of  each  file  matching  *.nki  becomes the
       description of a Non Kitten Item.  Lines beginning with '#' or '%' are ignored.  This allows comments  to
       be used in nki files and allows <a href="../man6/fortune.6.html">fortune</a>(6) files to be used.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man6/robotfindskitten.6.html">robotfindskitten</a></b>(6) uses the <b>HOME</b> environment variable to find the <a href="file:~/.robotfindskitten">~/.robotfindskitten</a> directory.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The  exit  status is <b>0</b> if robot found kitten; <b>1</b> if you quit or there was a problem; and the signal number
       if <b><a href="../man6/robotfindskitten.6.html">robotfindskitten</a></b>(6) exits gracefully due to a signal.

</pre><h4><b>A</b> <b>FINAL</b> <b>THOUGHT</b></h4><pre>
       Day and night I feverishly worked upon the machine, creating both a soul which could desire its goal, and
       a body with which it could realize it.  Many who saw my creation called it an abomination, and denied  me
       grant  money.  But they could not dissuade me from my impossible task. It was a spectre that tormented me
       always, a ghost I had to give a form and a life, lest it consume me from the inside. And when at last  my
       task  was  done,  when the grey box on wheels was complete and when it, as well as I, knew what had to be
       done, I felt deep sympathy for the machine. For I had not destroyed the phantom, but merely exorcized  it
       into  another  body.  The robot knew not why this task had to be performed, for I could not imbue it with
       knowledge I did not myself posess. And at the same time, I felt a sweeping sense of relief sweep over me,
       that somehow, the dream that had driven me for my entire life had come one step closer to fruition.

       "Gort, Klaatu Verada Nikto"

       As I vocally activated the robot, I realized that it was following my instructions, but not  out  of  any
       desire  to  obey  me. Had I remained silent, it would have performed exactly the same operations. We were
       two beings controlled by the same force now. And yet, seeking vainly to hold  some  illusion  of  control
       over the machine I thought I had created, I gave my final command.

       "GO!"   I  told  the  box  as  it  began  to roll out of my workshop into the frozen desert beyond. "FIND
       KITTEN!"
