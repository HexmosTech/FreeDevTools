       c4 - Chip's Challenge combined converter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           c4 [-INTYPE] INFILENAME [-OUTTYPE] OUTFILENAME

       c4 allows one to translate between the several different types of files used to represent level sets for
       the game Chip's Challenge.

       c4 expects there to be two files named on the command-line. c4 reads the levels stored in the first file,
       and then writes the levels out to the second file. The format to use with each file usually can be
       inferred by c4 by examining the filenames. If not, then it may be necessary to use switches before one or
       both filenames to indicate their type.

       There are four different types of files that c4 understands.

           -D     MS data file (*.dat).

       This is the file type used by Chip's Challenge for Microsoft Windows 3.x. It is the file type used by
       most other programs, such as ChipEdit and Tile World.

           -R     Lynx ROM file (*.lnx, *.lyx)

       This "file type" is actually just a ROM image of the original Chip's Challenge for the Atari Lynx
       handheld. It is used by Lynx emulators such as Handy.

           -P     MS-DOS fileset (directory of *.pak files)

       This is the format used by the MS-DOS port of Chip's Challenge. In this case, the filename given on the
       command line actually names a directory, containing *.pak files.

           -T     textual source file (*.txt)

       This file type is native to c4. It is a plain text file, which allows levels to be defined pictorially
       using a simple text editor. A complete description of the syntax of these files is provided below.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
           c4 mylevels.txt mylevels.dat

       Create a .dat file from a textual source file.

           c4 -P levels -D doslevels.dat

       "levels" is a directory of MS-DOS *.pak files. c4 translates the directory contents into a single .dat
       file. Note that the switches in this example are optional, as c4 would be able to infer the desired
       formats.

           c4 mylevels.dat chipsch.lnx

       Embed the levels from the .dat file into a Lynx ROM file. Note that c4 does NOT create chipsch.lnx. You
       must provide the ROM image file, which c4 then alters to contain your levels. (Obviously, you should not
       use this command on your master copy of the ROM file.)

           c4 chipsch.lnx -T out

       Output the levels in the .dat file as a text file. Here the -T switch is needed to indicate that a text
       file is the desired output format.

       When producing a text file, c4 will attempt to produce legible source, but the results will often not be
       as good as what a human being would produce. (In particular, c4 cannot draw overlays.)

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Be aware that there can be various problems when translating a set of levels using the MS ruleset to one
       of the Lynx-only file formats.  There are numerous objects and configurations in the MS ruleset which
       cannot be represented in the Lynx ruleset. Usually c4 will display a warning when some aspect of the data
       could not be transferred intact because of this.

       The remainder of this documentation describes the syntax of the textual source file format.

</pre><h4><b>LAYOUT</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>INPUT</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The source file is broken up into subsections. Each subsection defines a separate level in the set.

       The subsections are separated from each other by a line containing three percent signs:

           %%%

       A line of three percent signs also comes before the first level and after the last level, at the end of
       the source file.

       Any other line that begins with a percent sign is treated as a comment, and its contents are ignored.

       Beyond these things, the source file consists of statements.  Statements generally appear as a single
       line of text. Some statements, however, require multiple lines. These multi-line statements are
       terminated with the word <b>end</b> appearing alone on a line.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>HEADER</b> <b>STATEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       There are a couple of statements that can appear at the very top of the source file, before the first
       level subsection.

           ruleset [ lynx | ms ]

       The <b>ruleset</b> statement is the most important of these. It defines the ruleset for the level set. If the
       <b>ruleset</b> statment is absent, it defaults to <b>lynx</b>.

           maxlevel NNN

       The <b>maxlevel</b> statement specifies the number of the last level in the .dat file. By default, this value is
       provided automatically and does not need to be specified.

       In addition to the above, a set of tile definitions can appear in the header area. See below for a full
       description of the <b>tiles</b> multi-line statement. Any tile definitions provided here remain in force
       throughout the file.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>LEVEL</b> <b>STATEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Within each level's subsection, the following two statments will usually appear at the top.

           title STRING
           password PASS

       The <b>title</b> statement supplies the level's title, or name. The title string can be surrounded by double
       quotes, or unadorned. The <b>password</b> statement supplies the level's password. This password must consist of
       exactly four uppercase alphabetic characters.

       If the level's number is 150 or less, the <b>password</b> statement may be omitted. In that case the level's
       password will default to match that level in the original Lynx set. (N.B.: The Lynx ROM file format does
       not provide a mechanism for setting passwords, so in that case the default password will be used
       regardless.)

       The following statements may also appear in a level subsection.

           chips NNN

       The <b>chips</b> statement defines how many chips are required on this level to open the chip socket. The
       default value is zero.

           time NNN

       The <b>time</b> statement defines how many seconds are on the level's clock. The default value is zero (i.e., no
       time limit).

           hint STRING

       The <b>hint</b> statement defines the level's hint text. As with the <b>title</b> statement, the string can either be
       unadorned or delimited with double quotes. If a section contains multiple <b>hint</b> statements, the texts are
       appended together, e.g.:

           hint This is a relatively long hint, and so it
           hint is helpful to be able to break it up across
           hint several lines.

       Note that the same can be done with <b>title</b> statements.

           tiles
           DEF1
           DEF2
           ...
           end

       The <b>tiles</b> multi-line statement introduces one or more tile definitions. The definitions appear one per
       line, until a line containing <b>end</b> is found. Note that the tile definitions given here only apply to the
       current level. A complete description of tile definitions is given below.

           map [ X Y ]    map [ X Y ]
           LINE1          LINE1
           LINE2          LINE2
           ...            ...
           and            end
           OVER1
           OVER2
           ...
           end

       The <b>map</b> statement defines the actual contents of (part of) the level's map. The line containing the <b>map</b>
       statement can optionally include a pair of coordinates; these coordinates indicate where the the section
       will be located on the level's map. If coordinates are omitted, the defined section will be located at (0
       0) -- i.e., the upper-left corner of the level. The lines inside the <b>map</b> statement pictorially define the
       contents of the map section, until a line containing <b>and</b> or <b>end</b> is encountered. When the map is
       terminated by <b>and</b>, then the lines defining the map section are immediately followed by lines defining an
       overlay. The overlay uses the same origin as the map section (though it is permissible for the overlay to
       be smaller than the map section it is paired with). A complete description of the map and overlay
       sections is given below.

           border TL

       The <b>border</b> statement specifies a tile. The edges of the map are then changed to contain this tile.
       Typically this is used to enclose the level in walls.

       The following statements are also available, though they are usually not needed. They provide means for
       explicitly defining level data, for the occasional situation where the usual methods are more cumbersome.

           creatures X1 Y1 ; X2 Y2 ...

       The <b>creatures</b> statements permits explicit naming of the coordinates in the creature list. Pairs of
       coordinates are separated from each other by semicolons; any number of coordinate pairs can be specified.
       There can be multiple <b>creatures</b> statements in a level's subsection.

           traps P1 Q1 -&gt; R1 S1 ; P2 Q2 -&gt; R2 S2 ...

       The <b>traps</b> statement permits explicit naming of the coordinates for elements in the bear trap list.
       Coordinates are given in one or more groups of four, separated by semicolons. Each group consists of the
       x- and y-coordinates of the brown button, an arrow (-&gt;), and then the x- and y-coordinates of the bear
       trap. Any number of <b>traps</b> statements can appear in a level's subsection.

           cloners P1 Q1 -&gt; R1 S1 ; P2 Q2 -&gt; R2 S2 ...

       The <b>cloners</b> statement permits explicit naming of elements in the clone machine list. It uses the same
       syntax as the <b>traps</b> statment, with the red button's coordinates preceding the coordinates of the clone
       machine.

           level NNN

       The <b>level</b> statement defines the level's number. By default it is one more than the number of the prior
       level.

           field NN B01 B02 ...

       The <b>field</b> statement allows fields to be directly specified and embedded in the .dat file. The first
       argument specifies the field number; the remaining arguments provide the byte values for the actual field
       data. These statements are only meaningful in conjunction with producing a .dat file.

</pre><h4><b>DEFINING</b> <b>TILES</b></h4><pre>
       A tile definition consists of two parts. The first part is either one or two characters. The characters
       can be letters, numbers, punctuation -- anything except spaces. The second part is the name of a tile or
       a pair of tiles. The characters then become that tile's representation.

       Here is an example of some tile definitions:

           tiles
           #       wall
           *       teleport
           rb      red button
           @       chip south
           end

       (Note that a single tab character comes after the characters and before the tile names.) Once these
       definitions have been provided, the newly-defined characters can then be used in a map.

       The above definitions all use singular tiles. To define a pair of tiles, combine the two names with a
       plus sign, like so:

           tiles
           X       block + bomb
           G       glider north + clone machine
           end

       Notice that the top tile is named first, then the bottom tile.

       The <b>tiles</b> statement is the only statement that can appear in the header, as well as in a level's
       subsection. Tile definitions in the header are global, and can be used in every subsection. Tile
       definitions inside a subsection are local, and apply only to that level.

       A number of tile definitions are pre-set ahead of time, supplying standard representations for some of
       the most common tiles. (If these representations are not desired, the characters can always be
       redefined.) Here are some of the built-in definitions:

           #       wall                  $       computer chip
           ,       water                 H       socket
           =       ice                   E       exit
           &amp;       fire                  []      block
           6       bomb                  ?       hint button

       See below for the complete list of tile names and built-in definitions.

       A few groups tiles allow one to specify multiple definitions in a single line. For example:

           tiles
           G       glider
           end

       This one definition is equivalent to the following:

           tiles
           Gn      glider north
           Gs      glider south
           Ge      glider east
           Gw      glider west
           end

       (Note that "G" by itself is still undefined.) All creatures, including Chip, can be defined using this
       abbreviated form.

       Doors and keys are the other groups that have this feature; the following definition:

           tiles
           D       door
           end

       is equivalent to:

           tiles
           Dr      red door
           Db      blue door
           Dy      yellow door
           Dg      green door
           end

</pre><h4><b>MAP</b> <b>SECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Once all the needed tiles have defined representations, using the map statement is a simple matter. Here
       is an example:

           map
           # # # # # #
           # &amp;     &amp; # # #
               []    H E #
           # &amp;     $ # # #
           # # # # # #
           end

       This is a map of a small room. A block stands in the way of the entrance. Three of the four corners
       contain fire; the fourth contains a chip. On the east wall is an exit guarded by a chip socket.

       Note that each cell in the map is two characters wide. (Thus, for example, the octothorpes describe a
       solid wall around the room.)

       Here is a larger example, which presents the map from LESSON 2:

           tiles
           B       bug north
           C       chip south
           end

           map 7 7
               # # # # # # #
               #     $     #
               #           #
               #     #     # # # # # # # # # #
           # # #     # B     , ,           $ #
           # E H     # # B   , ,   [][]C ?   #
           # # #     # B     , ,           $ #
               #     #     # # # # # # # # # #
               #           #
               #     $     #
               # # # # # # #
           end

       There are a couple of different ways to fill a cell with two tiles.  The first way is to simply use tile
       definitions which contains two tiles:

           tiles
           X       block + bomb
           G       glider east + clone machine
           end

           map 12 14
                   # #
                 6 E #
                   # # X
           G
           end

       The second way is to squeeze two representations into a single cell.  Obviously, this can only be done
       with both representations are a single character.

           tiles
           [       block
           G       glider east
           +       clone machine
           end

           map 12 14
                   # #
                 6 E #
                   # # [6
           G+
           end

       In both cases, the top tile always comes before the bottom tile. Note that you can "bury" a tile by
       placing it to the right of a space:

           map
           # # # # # #
              6 6 6E #
           # # # # # #
           end

       Any number of map statements can appear in a level's subsection. The map statements will be combined
       together to make the complete map.

</pre><h4><b>OVERLAY</b> <b>SECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Every map statement can optionally include an overlay section. This overlay permits button connections
       and monster ordering to be defined.

       The overlay is applied to the same position as the map section it accompanies. The overlay can duplicate
       parts of the map section it covers, and any such duplication will be ignored. The only characters in the
       overlay that are significant are the ones that differ from the map section it covers. These characters
       are treated as labels. Labels are always a single character; two non-space characters in a cell always
       indicates two separate labels. Any non-space characters can be used as labels, as long as they don't
       match up with the map.

       An overlay section defines a button connection by using the same label in two (or more) cells. One of the
       labelled cells will contain either a bear trap or a clone machine, and the other will contain the
       appropriate button. If there are more than two cells with the same label, all but one should contain a
       button.

       Characters that only appear once in an overlay, on the other hand, indicate creatures. The characters
       then indicate the ordering of the creatures in the creature list with respect to each other. The ordering
       of characters is the usual ASCII sequence (e.g., numbers first, then capital letters, then lowercase
       letters).

       For example, here is a map with an overlay that demonstrates all three of these uses:

           tiles
           G       glider east
           +       clone machine
           r       red button
           *       beartrap
           b       brown button
           end

           map
           G                           v #
           G+      *   r   * G+    b &amp;   # r
           G+    *     r     #           # r
           # &gt;   b b G             &lt; #   #
           and
           2                           v #
           A       c   C   d C     d &amp;   # A
           B     a     C     #           # B
           # &gt;   a c 1             &lt; #   #
           end

       In this example, capitals are used for the clone machine connections, lowercase for the bear trap
       connections, and numbers are used for the creature ordering.

       (Note that the gliders atop clone machines are not numbered. While it is not an error to include clone
       machine creatures in the ordering, they are ignored under the MS ruleset.)

       It is not necessary to reproduce any of the map section's text in the overlay section. Blanks can be used
       instead. The ignoring of matching text is simply a feature designed to assist the user in keeping the
       overlay's contents properly aligned.

       The <b>traps</b>, <b>cloners</b>, and <b>creatures</b> statements can be used in lieu of, or in conjunction with, data from
       overlay sections. In the case of the creature list, items are added to the list in the order that they
       are encountered in the source text.

       If a level contains no overlay information and none of the above three statements, then this information
       will be filled in automatically. The data will be determined by following the original Lynx-based rules
       -- viz., buttons are connected to the next beartrap/clone machine in reading order, wrapping around to
       the top if necessary. (Likewise, the creature ordering is just the order of the creatures in their
       initial placement, modified by swapping the first creature with Chip.) Thus, if you actually want to
       force an empty bear trap list, clone machine list, or creature list, you must include an empty <b>traps</b>,
       <b>cloners</b>, and/or <b>creatures</b> statement.

</pre><h4><b>TILE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       Here is the complete list of tiles as they are named in definitions.  Two or more names appearing on the
       same line indicates that they are two different names for the same tile. Note that the tile names are not
       case-sensitive; capitalization is ignored.

       (The last nine lines, listing the creatures, only show the north-facing versions. The remaining 27 names,
       for the south-, east-, and west-facing versions, follow the obvious patttern.)

       Note that tile names may be abbreviated to any unique prefix. In particular, this permits one to write
       names like "glider north" as simply "glider n".

       There are also tile names for the "extra" MS tiles. These tiles are listed in parentheses, as an
       indicator that they were not originally intended to be used in maps.

           (combination)
           (chip drowned)
           (chip burned)
           (chip bombed)
           (unused 1)
           (unused 2)
           (unused 3)
           (exiting)
           (exit 1)
           (exit 2)
           (chip swimming north)  (chip swimming n)
           (chip swimming west)   (chip swimming w)
           (chip swimming south)  (chip swimming s)
           (chip swimming east)   (chip swimming e)

       Finally, note that one can also explicitly refer to tiles by their hexadecimal byte value under the MS
       rules by using the "0x" prefix.  Thus, the names "0x2A" and "bomb" are equivalent.
