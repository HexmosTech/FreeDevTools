</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       frotz - interpreter for Infocom and other Z-Machine games

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>frotz</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>file</u> [<u>blorb_file</u>]

       At  least  one  file  must be specified on the command line.  This can be either a plain Z-code file or a
       Blorb file.  A Z-code file is a compiled executable for the Z-Machine.   A  Blorb  file  contains  audio,
       graphics, and other things in addition to the game wrapped up into a single file.  It can also optionally
       contain  the Z-Machine executable.  If a plain Z-code file is supplied, then <b>Frotz</b> will check for a Blorb
       file with the same base name but an extension of <b>.blb,</b> <b>.blorb,</b> or <b>.zblorb</b> and load it if found.

       If the file supplied on the command line is a Blorb file, then <b>Frotz</b> will check to see if a  Z-code  file
       is contained within.  If not found, then <b>Frotz</b> will complain and exit.

       An  alternatively-named  Blorb  file can be supplied as the optional second parameter to the command line
       invocation.

       If you want to play any of the games from Infocom that use sound or graphics, you  will  need  to  get  a
       corresponding Blorb file from the Interactive Fiction Archive.  See <b>FURTHER</b> <b>INFORMATION</b> below.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Frotz</b>  is  a Z-Machine interpreter.  The Z-machine is a virtual machine designed by Infocom to run all of
       their text adventures.  It went through multiple revisions during the lifetime of the  company,  and  two
       further  revisions  (V7  and  V8)  were  created  by  Graham  Nelson  after  the  company's  demise.  The
       specification is now quite well documented; this version of <b>Frotz</b> supports version  1.1.   See  <b>Z-MACHINE</b>
       <b>STANDARDS</b> below.

       This version of <b>Frotz</b> fully supports all these versions of the Z-Machine except for version 6.  Version 6
       is  semi-supported  by displaying the outlines of V6 graphics with the picture number in the bottom-right
       corner.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>     Watch attribute setting.  Setting and clearing of attributes on objects will be noted in debugging
              messages.

       <b>-A</b>     Watch attribute testing.  Every time the Z-machine tests an attribute  value,  the  test  and  the
              result will be reported.

       <b>-b</b> <b>&lt;colorname&gt;</b>
              Sets  the default background color.  &lt;colorname&gt; corresponds to one of the Z-machine colors, which
              are as follows:
                  <u>black</u> <u>red</u> <u>green</u> <u>yellow</u> <u>blue</u> <u>magenta</u> <u>cyan</u> <u>white</u>
              If color support is disabled or not available on your terminal, this option does nothing.

       <b>-c</b> <b>N</b>   Sets the number of context lines used.  By default, after a ''[MORE]'' prompt, and assuming  there
              is  enough  output  pending,  <b>Frotz</b>  will  allow all the currently visible lines to scroll off the
              screen before prompting again.  This switch specifies how many lines of text <b>Frotz</b> will hold  over
              and display at the top of the next screen.

       <b>-d</b>     Disable color.

       <b>-e</b>     Enable sound.  If you've disabled sound in a config file and want to hear sound effects, use this.

       <b>-E</b> <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>
              Emphasis  mode.   <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>  corresponds  to  one  of  three possible ways to render emphasized text.
              Possible choices are as follows:
                  <u>italic</u> <u>underline</u> <u>none</u>
              Infocom created an EMPHASIS_STYLE for the Z-machine, which  was  supposed  to  make  the  text  be
              underlined  or  be  italicized.  Exactly  what  to  do  is  left  up  to  the  interpreter.   Some
              platforms/terminals could support either, both of these, or neither.  Underlining was more  common
              than italic. This option allows you to choose how EMPHASIS_STYLE is displayed.

       <b>-f</b> <b>&lt;colorname&gt;</b>
              Sets  the default foreground color.  &lt;colorname&gt; corresponds to one of the Z-machine colors, which
              are as follows:
                  <u>black</u> <u>red</u> <u>green</u> <u>yellow</u> <u>blue</u> <u>magenta</u> <u>cyan</u> <u>white</u>
              If color support is disabled or is not available on your terminal, this option does nothing.

       <b>-F</b>     Force color mode.  If you've disabled color in a config file and want to <b>Frotz</b> to display  colors,
              use this.

       <b>-h</b> <b>N</b>   Manually  sets  the text height.  Though most curses libraries are intelligent enough to determine
              the current width from the terminal, it may sometimes be necessary to use this option to  override
              the default.

       <b>-i</b>     Ignore fatal errors.  If a Z-Machine interpreter encounters a zcode error such as division-by-zero
              or  addressing an illegal object, the proper response is to abort execution.  This is done because
              the zcode program doesn't have a clear idea of what is going on.  There are some games  out  there
              that  cause  fatal  errors  because  the authors were careless and used an interpreter that didn't
              properly check for errors.  This option is intended to get around such bugs, but  be  warned  that
              Strange Things may happen if fatal errors are not caught.

       <b>-I</b> <b>N</b>   Set  the  interpreter  number.  Infocom designed the Z-machine such that a game could tell on what
              kind of machine the interpreter was running.  See <b>INTERPRETER</b> <b>NUMBER</b> below.

       <b>-l</b> <b>N</b>   Sets the left margin, for those who might have specific formatting needs.

       <b>-L</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              When the game starts, load this saved game file.

       <b>-m</b>     Enable mouse support.  Naturally, this is quite limited, but it's available for anyone  who  wants
              to experiment with it. When active, the mouse cannot be used to copy text from the terminal.

       <b>-o</b>     Watch object movement.  This option enables debugging messages from the interpreter which describe
              the moving of objects in the object tree.

       <b>-O</b>     Watch  object  location.   These  debugging messages detail the locations of objects in the object
              tree.

       <b>-p</b>     Plain ASCII output only.  This inhibits the output of accented letters and other  characters  from
              the  Latin-1 character set, replacing them with reasonable alternatives.  This may be necessary on
              devices lacking these characters.  The OE/oe dipthongs are missing from the  Latin-1  set.   These
              are handled as well.

       <b>-P</b>     Alter  the  <u>@piracy</u>  opcode.   The <u>@piracy</u> opcode was never used by Infocom. This switch is really
              only useful for those who like to toy around with Z-code.

       <b>-q</b>     Quiet.  Turns off sound effects.  Useful when running <b>Frotz</b> on a remote machine and you don't want
              to bother whoever's near the console with weird noises.

       <b>-r</b> <b>N</b>   Sets the right margin.

       <b>-R</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Restricted read/write.  Reading and writing files will be restricted only to  the  provided  path.
              Ordinarily  <b>Frotz</b>  will write or read its saves, transcripts, and move recordings in whatever path
              or directory the user provides when the <b>SAVE,</b> <b>SCRIPT,</b> or <b>RECORDING</b> commands are given.   This  can
              be undesirable if <b>Frotz</b> is run in a restricted environment, by a front end, or by a chatbot.  This
              option  will  cause  <b>Frotz</b>  to  write or read only to the provided path and nowhere else. Then the
              controlling process can then watch that directory for changes and need  not  worry  about  someone
              scribbling or snooping who-knows-where.

       <b>-s</b> <b>N</b>   Set the random number seed value.  The given seed value is used as the initial seed value on every
              restart.  By  default,  the random number generator is initialized based on the system clock; this
              allows you to make the random number  generator  predictable,  for  use  in  recorded  scripts  or
              debugging.   For instance, <b>Curses</b> makes random decisions before the first input (such that the hot
              key Alt-S does not really help).

       <b>-t</b>     Sets the Z-machine's <u>Tandy</u> <u>bit,</u> which may affect the  behavior  of  certain  Infocom  games.   For
              example, Zork I pretends not to have sequels, and Witness has its language toned down.

       <b>-u</b> <b>N</b>   Sets the number of slots available for <b>Frotz's</b> multiple undo hotkey (see below).  This defaults to
              25, which should be sufficient for most purposes.  Setting too high a number here may be dangerous
              on machines with limited memory.

       <b>-w</b> <b>N</b>   Manually sets the text width.

       <b>-x</b>     Expand  the abbreviations "g", "x", and "z" to "again", "examine", and "wait".  This switch is for
              use with old Infocom games that lack these common abbreviations which  were  introduced  in  later
              games.  Use it with caution: A few games might use "g", "x" or "z" for different purposes.

       <b>-v</b>     Show version information and exit.  This will display the version of <b>Frotz,</b> some information about
              what's  enabled  and  what's  not,  the  commit date of the source code, and a <b><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></b>(1) hash of that
              commit.

       <b>-Z</b> <b>N</b>   Error checking mode.
                  0 = don't report errors.
                  1 = report first instance of an error.
                  2 = report all errors.
                  3 = exit after any error.
              Default is 1 (report first instance of an error).

</pre><h4><b>HOT</b> <b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       These hot keys are enabled only when the Z-machine is waiting for line input (for Z-machine experts:  the
       <u>@read</u> opcode).

              <b>Alt-D</b> Set debugging options.
              <b>Alt-H</b> Help (print the list of hot keys).
              <b>Alt-N</b> New game (restart).
              <b>Alt-P</b> Playback on.
              <b>Alt-R</b> Recording on/off.
              <b>Alt-S</b> Set random number seed.
              <b>Alt-U</b> Undo one turn.
              <b>Alt-X</b> Exit game (after confirmation).

</pre><h4><b>INTERPRETER</b> <b>NUMBER</b></h4><pre>
       The  interpreter  number is a setting in the Z-machine header which is used to tell the game on what sort
       of machine the interpreter is running.  <b>Frotz</b> will automatically choose the most appropriate number for a
       given Infocom-produced game.  Should you want to override the number, the <b>-I</b> option is available.

       An interpreter should choose the interpreter number most suitable for the machine it  will  run  on.   In
       Versions  up  to  5,  the  main  consideration  is  that  the  behaviour  of 'Beyond Zork' depends on the
       interpreter number (in terms of its usage of the character graphics font). In Version 6, the decision  is
       more  serious,  as existing Infocom story files depend on interpreter number in many ways: moreover, some
       story files expect to be run only on the interpreters for a particular machine.  There are, for instance,
       specifically Amiga versions.  The DECSystem-20 was Infocom's own in-house mainframe.

       For Infocom's four V6 games, the interpreter number will be automatically chosen based on the  title  and
       release number.  Of course, this can be overridden at the command line.

       Infocom used the following interpreter numbers:

              <b>1</b>  <b>DECSystem</b> <b>20</b>
              <b>2</b>  <b>Apple</b> <b>IIe</b>
              <b>3</b>  <b>Macintosh</b>
              <b>4</b>  <b>Amiga</b>
              <b>5</b>  <b>Atari</b> <b>ST</b>
              <b>6</b>  <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b>
              <b>7</b>  <b>Commodore</b> <b>128</b>
              <b>8</b>  <b>Commodore</b> <b>64</b>
              <b>9</b>  <b>Apple</b> <b>IIc</b>
              <b>10</b> <b>Apple</b> <b>IIgs</b>
              <b>11</b> <b>Tandy</b> <b>Color</b>

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       On  startup,  <b>Frotz</b>  will  first  check  the  system's  frotz.conf  then $HOME/.frotzrc for configuration
       information.  The configuration file uses a simple syntax of

              <b>&lt;variable&gt;</b> <b>&lt;whitespace&gt;</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>

       Color names may be any of the following:

              <b>black</b> <b>|</b> <b>red</b> <b>|</b> <b>green</b> <b>|</b> <b>blue</b> <b>|</b> <b>magenta</b> <b>|</b> <b>cyan</b> <b>|</b> <b>white</b>

       <b>ascii</b>   on | off
       Use plain ASCII only.  Default is "off".

       <b>background</b>   &lt;colorname&gt;
       Set background color.  Default is terminal's default background color.

       <b>color</b>   yes | no
       Use color text.  Default is "yes" if supported.

       <b>errormode</b>   never | once | always | fatal
       Set error reporting mode.

              <u>never</u> Don't report any errors except for fatal ones.
              <u>once</u> Report only the first instance of an error.
              <u>always</u> Report every instance of an error.
              <u>fatal</u> Abort on any error, even non-fatal ones.
              Default is "once".

       <b>expand_abb</b>   on | off
       Expand abbreviations.  Default is off.  Expand the abbreviations "g", "x", and "z" to "again", "examine",
       and "wait".  This switch is for use with old Infocom games that lack  these  common  abbreviations  which
       were  introduced  in  later  games.  Use it with caution.  A few games might use the "g", "x", or "z" for
       different purposes.

       <b>foreground</b>   &lt;colorname&gt;
       Set foreground color.  Default is terminal's default foreground color.

       <b>ignore_fatal</b>   on | off
       Ignore fatal errors.  If a Z-Machine interpreter encounters a zcode error  such  as  division-by-zero  or
       addressing  an illegal object, the proper response is to abort execution.  This is done because the zcode
       program doesn't have a clear idea of what is going on.  There are some games out there that  cause  fatal
       errors  because  the authors were careless and used an interpreter that didn't properly check for errors.
       This option is intended to get around such bugs, but be warned that Strange Things may  happen  if  fatal
       errors are not caught.
       Default is "off"

       <b>piracy</b>   on | off
       Alter  the  piracy  opcode.  Default is off.  The piracy opcode was never used by Infocom. This option is
       only useful for those who like to toy around with Z-code.

       <b>randseed</b>   &lt;integer&gt;
       Set random number seed.  Default comes from the Unix epoch.

       <b>sound</b>   on | off
       Turn sound effects on or off.  Default is "on".

       <b>tandy</b>   on | off
       Set the machine's <u>Tandy</u> <u>bit.</u>  This may affect the behavior of certain Infocom games.  For example, Zork I
       pretends not to have sequels, and Witness has its language toned down.  Default is "off".

       <b>undo_slots</b>   &lt;integer&gt;
       Set number of undo slots.  Default is 500.

       <b>zcode_path</b>   /path/to/zcode/files:/another/path
       Set path to search for zcode game files.  This is just like the $PATH environmental variable except  that
       you   can't   put   environmental   variables   in  the  path  or  use  other  shortcuts.   For  example,
       "$HOME/games/zcode" is illegal because the shell can't interpret that <b>$HOME</b> variable.

       <b>The</b> <b>following</b> <b>options</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>only</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> <b>weird</b> <b>terminals,</b> <b>weird</b> <b>curses</b> <b>libraries</b> <b>or</b> <b>if</b>  <b>you</b>  <b>want</b>
       <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>look</b> <b>(like</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> <b>40-column</b> <b>mode).</b>

       <b>context_lines</b>   &lt;integer&gt;
       Set  the  number  of  context  lines  used.  By default, after a ``[MORE]'' prompt, and assuming there is
       enough output pending, <b>Frotz</b> will allow all the currently visible lines to scroll off the  screen  before
       prompting  again.   This  switch specifies how many lines of text <b>Frotz</b> will hold over and display at the
       top of the next screen.  Default is "0".

       <b>left_margin</b>   &lt;integer&gt;
       Set the left margin.  This is for those who might have special formatting needs.

       <b>right_margin</b>   &lt;integer&gt;
       Set the right margin.  This is for those who might have special formatting needs.

       <b>text_height</b>   &lt;integer&gt;
       Manually set text height.  Most curses libraries are intelligent enough to determine the current width of
       the terminal.  You may need to use this option to override the default.

       <b>text_width</b>   &lt;integer&gt;
       Manually set text width.  Again, this should not be necessary except in special circumstances.

       <b>script_width</b>   &lt;integer&gt;
       Set the transcript width.  Default is 80 columns per line, regardless of the current  text  width.   This
       switch allows you to change this setting.  You may set this to "0" to deactivate automatic line-splitting
       in transcript files.

       <b>The</b> <b>following</b> <b>options</b> <b>are</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> <b>debugging</b> <b>or</b> <b>cheating.</b>

       <b>attrib_set</b>   on | off
       Watch  attribute  setting.   Setting  and  clearing  of  attributes on objects will be noted in debugging
       messages.  Default is "off"

       <b>attrib_test</b>   on | off
       Watch attribute testing.  Every time the Z-machine tests an attribute value, the test and the result will
       be reported.  Default is "off".

       <b>obj_loc</b>   on | off
       Watch object location.  These debugging messages detail the locations of  objects  in  the  object  tree.
       Default is "off".

       <b>obj_move</b>   on | off
       Watch  object  movement.   This option enables debugging messages from the interpreter which describe the
       movement of objects in the object tree.  Default is "off".

</pre><h4><b>COLOR</b></h4><pre>
       Whether or not <b>Frotz</b> will display color depends upon the curses library and the terminal.  In general, an
       xterm or other X11-based terminal emulator will support color.  Sometimes the value of $TERM will need to
       be set to something like "xterm-color" or "rxvt-256color".  For a Linux console, <b>$TERM</b> is  almost  always
       set  to  "linux".   This  will  support  color.   For a NetBSD or OpenBSD console on an x86 or amd64, the
       default value of <b>$TERM</b> is "vt100".  To get color supported there, you need  to  set  $TERM  to  "pc3".  A
       FreeBSD console's <b>$TERM</b> is "xterm" and will support color.  Color on text consoles on machines other than
       x86 or amd64 is untested.

       On  some  operating  systems,  Xterm  will not change the cursor color to match that of the text.  To fix
       this, add the following line to your <b>.Xresources</b> file and type <b>xrdb</b> <b>-merge</b> <b>$HOME/.Xresources</b>

              xterm*cursorColor:      *XtDefaultForeground

       This can also be added to a systemwide  file  such  as  <b>/etc/X11/Xresources/x11-common</b>  or  <b>/etc/X11/app-</b>
       <b>defaults/XTerm.</b>  The names and locations of the system-wide files can vary from OS to OS.

</pre><h4><b>UNICODE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Frotz</b>  supports  Unicode glyphs by way of UTF-8 if the terminal used supports UTF-8.  If you prefer using
       <b>xterm</b>, start it as <b>uxterm</b> <b>.</b>  This is a wrapper script that sets up xterm with UTF-8 locale.  You can also
       manually tell an <b>xterm</b> to switch into UTF-8 mode by holding CTRL and the right mouse button to  bring  up
       the  VT  FONTS menu.  Depending on how <b>xterm</b> was installed, you may see an option for "UTF-8 Fonts" which
       will allow Unicode to be properly displayed.

       Getting normal xterm to behave like this all the time can vary from system  to  system.   Other  terminal
       emulators have their own ways of being set to use UTF-8 character encoding.

</pre><h4><b>NON</b> <b>ASCII</b> <b>CHARACTERS</b></h4><pre>
       Non-ASCII  glyphs  can  be  displayed  without  the  use of UTF-8 by way of the ISO-8859-1 or ISO-8859-15
       (Latin-1 or Latin-9) character sets.  ISO-8859-15 is more or less identical to ISO-8859-1 except that the
       OE/oe dipthongs are  supported,  replacing  the  seldom-used  1/2  and  1/4  glyphs.   See  also  <b><a href="../man1/luit.1.html">luit</a>(1)</b>
       <b><a href="../man7/charsets.7.html">charsets</a>(7)</b> <b><a href="../man7/iso_8859-1.7.html">iso_8859-1</a>(7)</b> and <b><a href="../man7/iso_8859-15.7.html">iso_8859-15</a>(7)</b> for more information.

</pre><h4><b>LOCALE</b></h4><pre>
       An  important  means  of  ensuring  the  system  knows  to  use  UTF-8  is to make sure the locale is set
       appropriately.  This is valid only when <b>Dumb</b> <b>Frotz</b> runs under Unix-ish systems.

       Using the command <b>locale</b> will tell you what is currently in use.  Using <b>locale</b> <b>-a</b> will  show  you  what's
       available.   Then  set  your  LANG  evironmental  variable to something appropriate by using one of these
       commands:

              export LANG=C.UTF-8 export LANG=en_US.utf8

       This can be put in your shell configuration file, be it  <b>.profile,</b>  <b>.bash_profile,</b>  <b>.login,</b>  <b>.bashrc,</b>  or
       whatever.

       It can also be set system-wide in the equivalent files in <b>/etc.</b>

</pre><h4><b>Z-MACHINE</b> <b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Frotz</b>  complies  with  the  Z-Machine Standard 1.1 of May 2006, revised February 2014.  The authoritative
       version is found here:
       <a href="http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point1/index.html">http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point1/index.html</a>

       As of 1.1, an additional optional <b>prompt</b> parameter is allowed on Version 5 extended  save/restore.   This
       parameter  allows  a  game  to  read  or write an auxiliary (aux) file without prompting the player.  See
       section 15 of the Standard for details.   <b>Frotz</b>  restricts  such  files  to  having  an  ".aux"  filename
       extension.  When the <b>-R</b> (restricted read/write) option is active, reads and writes through this mechanism
       are restricted to the provided path the same as all other file accesses.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       If the <b>ZCODE_PATH</b> environmental variable is defined, <b>Frotz</b> will search that path for game files.  If that
       doesn't  exist, <b>INFOCOM_PATH</b> will be searched.  Any additional files required, such as auxilary, or blorb
       files must be in the same directory as <b>Frotz</b> finds the story file.

       For the Alt key to be read correctly in an Xterm, the following lines should be in your .Xresources file:

              XTerm*metaSendsEscape: true
              XTerm*eightBitInput: false

</pre><h4><b>FURTHER</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Frotz</b> homepage is at <b>https://661.org/proj/if/frotz/.</b>

       A <b><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></b>(1) repository of all versions of <b>Unix</b> <b>Frotz</b> back to 2.32 to the  bleeding  edge  is  available  for
       public perusal at
       <b>https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/frotz/.</b>

       The  Interactive  Fiction  Archive,  at <b>https://www.ifarchive.org/</b>, is a good place to find games to play
       with <b>Frotz.</b>  To play Infocom's games that use graphics or sound, you'll need to get  corresponding  Blorb
       files from there.  Various ports and builds for <b>Frotz</b> may also be found at the IF Archive.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The  Z Machine itself has trouble with the concept of resizing a terminal.  It assumes that once the text
       height and width are set, they will never  change;  even  across  saves.   This  made  sense  when  24x80
       terminals were the norm and graphical user interfaces were mostly unknown.  I'm fairly sure there's a way
       around  this problem, but for now, don't resize an xterm in which <b>Frotz</b> is running.  Also, you should try
       to make sure the terminal on which you restore a saved game has the same dimensions as the one  on  which
       you saved the game.

       Audio  latency  might  be  unreasonably  long  depending on the settings of your operating system.  Linux
       generally has things right.  The BSDs may need some <b><a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl</a></b>(8) settings adjusted.   See  the  <b><a href="../man4/sound.4.html">sound</a></b>(4)  or
       <b><a href="../man4/audio.4.html">audio</a></b>(4) manpages for more information.

       You  can use a path like <b>/usr/local/games/zcode:$HOME/zcode</b> with <b>$ZCODE_PATH</b> or <b>$INFOCOM_PATH</b> because the
       shell will digest that <b>$HOME</b> variable for you before setting <b>$ZCODE_PATH</b>.   While  processing  <b>frotz.conf</b>
       and  <b>$HOME/.frotzrc</b>,  a  shell  is  not  used.  Therefore  you  cannot use environmental variables in the
       <b>zcodepath</b> option within the config files.

       This manpage is not intended to  tell  users  HOW  to  play  interactive  fiction.   Refer  to  the  file
