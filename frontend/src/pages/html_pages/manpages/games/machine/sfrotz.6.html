</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sfrotz - interpreter for Infocom and other Z-Machine games (SDL interface)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sfrotz</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>file</u> [<u>blorb_file</u>]

       At  least  one  file  must be specified on the command line.  This can be either a plain Z-code file or a
       Blorb file.  A Z-code file is a compiled executable for the Z-Machine.   A  Blorb  file  contains  audio,
       graphics, and other things in addition to the game wrapped up into a single file.  It can also optionally
       contain  the Z-Machine executable.  If a plain Z-code file is supplied, then <b>Frotz</b> will check for a Blorb
       file with the same base name but an extension of <b>.blb,</b> <b>.blorb,</b> or <b>.zblorb</b> and load it if found.

       If the file supplied on the command line is a Blorb file, then <b>Frotz</b> will check to see if a  Z-code  file
       is contained within.  If not found, then <b>Frotz</b> will complain and exit.

       An  alternatively-named  Blorb  file can be supplied as the optional second parameter to the command line
       invocation.

       If you want to play any of the games from Infocom that use sound or graphics, you  will  need  to  get  a
       corresponding Blorb file from the Interactive Fiction Archive.  See <b>FURTHER</b> <b>INFORMATION</b> below.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Frotz</b>  is  a Z-Machine interpreter.  The Z-machine is a virtual machine designed by Infocom to run all of
       their text adventures.  It went through multiple revisions during the lifetime of the  company,  and  two
       further  revisions  (V7  and  V8)  were  created  by  Graham  Nelson  after  the  company's  demise.  The
       specification is now quite well documented; this version of <b>Frotz</b> supports version  1.1.   See  <b>Z-MACHINE</b>
       <b>STANDARDS</b> below..P This version of <b>Frotz</b> fully supports all these versions of the Z-Machine including the
       graphical  version  6.   Graphics and sound are created through the use of the SDL libraries.  AIFF sound
       effects and music in MOD and OGG formats  are  supported  when  packaged  in  Blorb  container  files  or
       optionally from individual files.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>     Watch attribute setting.  Setting and clearing of attributes on objects will be noted in debugging
              messages.

       <b>-A</b>     Watch  attribute  testing.   Every  time  the Z-machine tests an attribute value, the test and the
              result will be reported.

       <b>-b</b> <b>&lt;colorname&gt;</b>
              Sets the default background color.  &lt;colorname&gt; corresponds to one of the Z-machine colors,  which
              are as follows:
              <u>black</u> <u>red</u> <u>green</u> <u>yellow</u> <u>blue</u> <u>magenta</u> <u>cyan</u> <u>white</u>
              If color support is disabled or not available on your terminal, this option does nothing.

       <b>-c</b> <b>N</b>   Sets  the number of context lines used.  By default, after a ``[MORE]'' prompt, and assuming there
              is enough output pending, <b>Frotz</b> will allow all the currently  visible  lines  to  scroll  off  the
              screen  before prompting again.  This switch specifies how many lines of text <b>Frotz</b> will hold over
              and display at the top of the next screen.

       <b>-C</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Load this configuration file instead of $HOME/.sfrotzrc.

       <b>-d</b>     Disable color.

       <b>-f</b> <b>&lt;colorname&gt;</b>
              Sets the default foreground color.  &lt;colorname&gt; corresponds to one of the Z-machine colors,  which
              are as follows
                  <u>black</u> <u>red</u> <u>green</u> <u>yellow</u> <u>blue</u> <u>magenta</u> <u>cyan</u> <u>white</u>
              If color support is disabled or is not available on your terminal, this option does nothing.

       <b>-h</b> <b>N</b>   Manually sets the text height.

       <b>-i</b>     Ignore fatal errors.  If a Z-Machine interpreter encounters a zcode error such as division-by-zero
              or  addressing an illegal object, the proper response is to abort execution.  This is done because
              the zcode program doesn't have a clear idea of what is going on.  There are some games  out  there
              that  cause  fatal  errors  because  the authors were careless and used an interpreter that didn't
              properly check for errors.  This option is intended to get around such bugs, but  be  warned  that
              Strange Things may happen if fatal errors are not caught.

       <b>-I</b> <b>N</b>   Set  the  interpreter  number.  Infocom designed the Z-machine such that a game could tell on what
              kind of machine the interpreter was running.  See <b>INTERPRETER</b> <b>NUMBER</b> below.

       <b>-l</b> <b>N</b>   Sets the left margin, for those who might have specific formatting needs.

       <b>-L</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              When the game starts, load this saved game file.

       <b>-o</b>     Watch object movement.  This option enables debugging messages from the interpreter which describe
              the moving of objects in the object tree.

       <b>-O</b>     Watch object location.  These debugging messages detail the locations of  objects  in  the  object
              tree.

       <b>-P</b>     Alter  the  <u>@piracy</u>  opcode.   The <u>@piracy</u> opcode was never used by Infocom. This switch is really
              only useful for those who like to toy around with Z-code.

       <b>-r</b> <b>N</b>   Sets the right margin.

       <b>-s</b> <b>N</b>   Set the random number seed value.  The given seed value is used as the initial seed value on every
              restart. By default, the random number generator is initialized based on the  system  clock;  this
              allows  you  to  make  the  random  number  generator  predictable, for use in recorded scripts or
              debugging.  For instance, <b>Curses</b> makes random decisions before the first input (such that the  hot
              key Alt-S does not really help).

       <b>-S</b> <b>N</b>   Set the transcript width.  By default your transcript files are formatted to a width of 80 columns
              per line, regardless of the current text width.  This switch allows you to change this setting. In
              particular, use -S 0 to deactivate automatic line splitting in transcript files.

       <b>-t</b>     Sets  the  Z-machine's  <u>Tandy</u>  <u>bit,</u>  which  may affect the behavior of certain Infocom games.  For
              example, Zork I pretends not to have sequels, and Witness has its language toned down.

       <b>-u</b> <b>N</b>   Sets the number of slots available for <b>Frotz's</b> multiple undo hotkey (see below).  This defaults to
              25, which should be sufficient for most purposes.  Setting too high a number here may be dangerous
              on machines with limited memory.

       <b>-w</b> <b>N</b>   Manually sets the text width.

       <b>-x</b>     Expand the abbreviations "g", "x", and "z" to "again", "examine", and "wait".  This switch is  for
              use  with  old  Infocom  games that lack these common abbreviations which were introduced in later
              games.  Use it with caution: A few games might use "g", "x" or "z" for different purposes.

       <b>-Z</b> <b>N</b>   Error checking mode.
                  0 = don't report errors.
                  1 = report first instance of an error.
                  2 = report all errors.
                  3 = exit after any error.
              Default is 1 (report first instance of an error).

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-@</b> <b>&lt;listfile&gt;</b>
              Use resource files listed in &lt;listfile&gt; (see NON BLORB RESOURCES).

       <b>-%</b>     Use local resource files.

       <b>-F</b>     Run in fullscreen mode (see NOTES).

       <b>-m</b> <b>&lt;msecs&gt;</b>
              Set the timer interrupt cycle to &lt;msecs&gt; milliseconds, instead of the default 100 (1/10 sec).

       <b>-N</b> <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>
              Set the mode (date or name) for creating default file names for  save/script  etc.   For  <u>date</u>,  a
              timestamp  is  prepended  to the filename extension.  For <u>name</u>, a four-digit number beginning with
              <u>0000</u> is prepended to the filename extension.

       <b>-T</b>     Use traditional in-game requests for file names, instead of on-screen dialogs.

       <b>-v</b>     Show version information and exit.  This will display the version of Frotz, some information about
              what's enabled and what's not, the commit date of the source code,  and  a  <b><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></b>(1)  hash  of  that
              commit.

       <b>-V</b>     Force the use of default monospaced VGA font.

</pre><h4><b>HOT</b> <b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Sfrotz</b>  supports  the same hot keys as standard <b>Frotz,</b> plus the Ctl-Alt-X combination for immediate exit,
       which may be used in case of emergency. Note that these hot keys are enabled only when the  Z-machine  is
       waiting  for line input (for Z-machine experts: <u>@read</u> opcode), with the exception of Ctl-Alt-X which also
       works in single character input mode (<u>@read_char</u> opcode).

       <b>Alt-D</b>  Set debugging options.

       <b>Alt-H</b>  Help (print the list of hot keys).

       <b>Alt-N</b>  New game (restart).

       <b>Alt-P</b>  Playback on.

       <b>Alt-R</b>  Recording on/off.

       <b>Alt-S</b>  Set random number seed.

       <b>Alt-U</b>  Undo one turn.

       <b>Alt-X</b>  Exit game (after confirmation).

       <b>Ctl-Alt-X</b>
              Exit game immediately (no confirmation).

</pre><h4><b>WINDOW</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Sfrotz</b> has a hardwired default screen size of 640x400. The screen size can be changed by  the  values  in
       this section, by the values found in the Reso chunk of a Blorb file, and finally by the -w and -h command
       line  options  (in that order). Note however that <b>Sfrotz</b> shall refuse to set a screen width less than 640
       and/or a height less than 400. NOTE: for normal (windowed) usage, the screen  size  should  obviously  be
       less than the physical screen resolution (taking into account also window decorations, taskbars etc.) For
       fullscreen usage, the size should preferably be one of those supported by the PC video driver; otherwise,
       SDL  shall  try  to  use  the  next  higher available resolution, with black borders around the Z-machine
       screen. In fullscreen mode, however, it may happen that for some  strange  resolutions  SDL  accepts  the
       request, but the screen goes blank... In such a case, you may shut down the program by pressing Ctrl-Alt-
       X.

</pre><h4><b>INTERPRETER</b> <b>NUMBER</b></h4><pre>
       The  interpreter  number is a setting in the Z-machine header which is used to tell the game on what sort
       of machine the interpreter is running.  <b>Sfrotz</b> will automatically choose the most appropriate number  for
       a given Infocom-produced game.  Should you want to override the number, the <b>-I</b> option is available.

       An  interpreter  should  choose  the interpreter number most suitable for the machine it will run on.  In
       Versions up to 5, the main  consideration  is  that  the  behaviour  of  'Beyond  Zork'  depends  on  the
       interpreter  number (in terms of its usage of the character graphics font). In Version 6, the decision is
       more serious, as existing Infocom story files depend on interpreter number in many ways:  moreover,  some
       story files expect to be run only on the interpreters for a particular machine.  There are, for instance,
       specifically Amiga versions.  The DECSystem-20 was Infocom's own in-house mainframe.

       For  Infocom's  four V6 games, the interpreter number will be automatically chosen based on the title and
       release number.  Of course, this can be overridden at the command line.

       Infocom used the following interpreter numbers:

              <b>1</b>  <b>DECSystem</b> <b>20</b>
              <b>2</b>  <b>Apple</b> <b>IIe</b>
              <b>3</b>  <b>Macintosh</b>
              <b>4</b>  <b>Amiga</b>
              <b>5</b>  <b>Atari</b> <b>ST</b>
              <b>6</b>  <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b>
              <b>7</b>  <b>Commodore</b> <b>128</b>
              <b>8</b>  <b>Commodore</b> <b>64</b>
              <b>9</b>  <b>Apple</b> <b>IIc</b>
              <b>10</b> <b>Apple</b> <b>IIgs</b>
              <b>11</b> <b>Tandy</b> <b>Color</b>

</pre><h4><b>NON</b> <b>BLORB</b> <b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       Besides Blorb-packaged resources, <b>Sfrotz</b> can also  render  graphics  and  sound  from  individual  files,
       provided  the  latter  are  either  suitably named (e.g a common root with a numeric field specifying the
       resource number), or listed in a suitably formatted text file.

       Note that this feature is not automatic, but must be enabled by the <b>-%</b> or <b>-@</b> command line  options.  When
       the feature is enabled, resources found this way override those in the Blorb file, if present.

       This feature can be useful to game designers, as it eases changing and adding resources without having to
       re-compile the Blorb file each time.  The format of the list file used with the <b>-@</b>

       option  (see  <b>EXAMPLE</b>  <b>BLC</b> <b>FILE</b>) is identical to that of the BLC control file used by L. Ross Raszewski's
       iblorb package, so one can use the same list for compiling the final Blorb file for distribution.

</pre><h4><b>TRUETYPE</b> <b>FONTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Sfrotz</b> can display text with Truetype or Type1 fonts, using the FreeType2 rendering library. The location
       of the necessary font files must be specified in the setup file. Also, antialiased rendering of  Truetype
       fonts  can  be  specified. Please note that this feature in <b>sfrotz</b> is still <b>experimental,</b> so don't expect
       too much (e.g., kerning is not supported).

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>FONTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Sfrotz</b> does not need Truetype fonts to work; in fact it has a default monospaced font, based on  an  8x16
       VGA  font,  which  can  be used for both the TEXT_FONT and the FIXED_FONT of the z-machine, with suitable
       (though not very nice) modifications for the various styles. Even if Truetype fonts are specified in  the
       setup file, <b>Sfrotz</b> can be forced to use the VGA font by the <b>-V</b> command line switch.

</pre><h4><b>UNICODE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Sfrotz</b>  supports  Unicode glyphs by way of UTF-8 as long as the fonts loaded contain the glyphs you need.
       The default font provided by SDL does not contain much beyond the Latin  alphabet  and  some  diacritical
       marks.   Inverted  punctuation  marks as used in Spanish are missing.  Two monospaced fonts known to work
       well with most commonly-encountered alphabetic languages are Leggie and FreeMono. They can  be  found  at
       https://memleek.org/leggie/  (X11 BDF fonts) and https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/ (Truetype fonts).
       Logographic glyphs (Kanji and Chinese are not currently supported.

</pre><h4><b>Z-MACHINE</b> <b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Sfrotz</b> complies with the Z-Machine Standard 1.1 of May 2006, revised February  2014.   The  authoritative
       version is found here:
       <a href="http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point1/index.html">http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point1/index.html</a>

       As  of  1.1, an additional optional <b>prompt</b> parameter is allowed on Version 5 extended save/restore.  This
       parameter allows a game to read or write an auxiliary (aux)  file  without  prompting  the  player.   See
       section  15  of  the  Standard  for  details.   <b>Frotz</b>  restricts  such files to having an ".aux" filename
       extension.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       If the <b>ZCODE_PATH</b> environmental variable is defined, <b>Frotz</b> will search that path for game files.  If that
       doesn't exist, <b>INFOCOM_PATH</b> will be searched.  Any additional files required,  such  as  graphics  files,
       sounds directory, auxilary, or blorb files must be in the same directory as <b>sfrotz</b> finds the story file.

</pre><h4><b>SETUP</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       On  startup,  <b>sfrotz</b> will check $HOME/.sfrotzrc for setup information.  The setup file has four sections:
       Interpreter, Display, Fonts, and Resources.

       The <b>Interpreter</b> section deals with options having to do with how the <b>Frotz</b> core works.

       The <b>Window</b> section deals with screen display.  <b>Sfrotz</b> has a hardwired default screen size of 640x400. The
       screen size can be changed by the values in this section, by the values found in  the  Reso  chunk  of  a
       Blorb  file, and finally by the -w and -h command line options (in that order).  Note however that <b>sfrotz</b>
       shall refuse to set a screen width less than 640 and/or a height less than 400.

       <b>NOTE</b>: for normal (windowed) usage, the screen size should obviously be less than the PC screen resolution
       (taking into account also window decorations, taskbars  etc.)  For  fullscreen  usage,  the  size  should
       preferably  be  one  of  those supported by the PC video driver; otherwise, SDL shall try to use the next
       higher available resolution, with black borders around the z-machine screen. In fullscreen mode, however,
       it may happen that for some strange resolutions SDL accepts the request, but the screen goes blank...  In
       such a case, you may shut down the program by pressing Ctrl-Alt-X.

       The <b>Display</b> section is reserved for future developments.

       The  <b>Fonts</b>  section is for defining the font directory, font files, and if antialiasing is enabled (which
       is currently not supported).

       The following eight statements: textroman, textbold, textitalic, textbolditalic,  fixedroman,  fixedbold,
       fixeditalic,  and  fixedbolditalic;  specify the eight font faces used by the z-machine (not counting the
       so-called graphics font used in Beyond Zork, which is hardwired in  the  program),  that  is  the  normal
       TEXT_FONT  and  the  monospaced  FIXED_FONT, each in four styles (roman, bold, italic and bold+italic). A
       single face is specified by the file name (with its suffix!), optionally followed by  an  @  sign  and  a
       number,  indicating  the  font  size  in  pixels  (default  is 14). Multiple face files can be specified,
       separated by pipe (|) characters; <b>Sfrotz</b> shall use the first one it finds (see  the  example  in  EXAMPLE
       SETUP FILE). This feature allows e.g. to use the same setup file on different systems.

       The  <b>Resources</b>  section  is  for  configuring  graphics  and sound resources.  Each template must contain
       exactly one C-style decimal format specifier (e.g. Pict%d) to be substituted by the resource number.

</pre><h4><b>SETUP</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>GRAMMAR</b></h4><pre>
       <b>[Interpreter]</b>

       Number = <u>number</u>
         Set the interpreter number (default is 4, i.e. Amiga Interpreter)

       Ignore Errors = <u>0/1</u>
         Ignore (1) or not (0) non-fatal runtime errors.

       Expand Abbreviations = <u>0/1</u>
         Set/reset expansion of g/x/z abbreviations.  Expansion  is  useful  for  old  v1  games  which  do  not
         understand such abbreviations. Default: 0 (the -xoption can set this switch.)

       Tandy Bit = <u>0/1</u>
         Set/reset the Tandy bit. Default: 0 (the -t option can set this switch.)

       Wrap Script Lines = <u>nc</u>
         Set the width (number of columns) of the transcript to nc. Same as -S option.

       SaveNames = <u>date/name</u>
         Set the mode (date or name) for creating default file names for save/script etc.  For <u>date</u>, a timestamp
         is prepended to the filename extension.  For <u>name</u>, a four-digit number beginning with <u>0000</u> is prepended
         to the filename extension.

       <b>[Window]</b>

       AcWidth = <u>width</u>
         Set the screen width in pixels (default: 640)

       AcHeight = <u>height</u>
         Set the screen height in pixels (default: 400)

       <b>[Display]</b>

       (This section reserved for future developments)

       <b>[Fonts]</b>

       antialias = <u>0/1</u>
         Set  antialiased  rendering of Truetype fonts off (0) or on (nonzero).  Note that this option cannot be
         overridden by a command line switch.

       fontdir = <u>folder</u>
         Specify the directory containing the Truetype fonts.  If this does not begin with  a  slash,  then  the
         directory is assumed to be relative to the user's home directory.

       textroman = <u>fontspec</u>
         Set the font file for TEXT_FONT, roman style.

       textbold = <u>fontspec</u>
         Set the font file for TEXT_FONT, bold style.

       textitalic = <u>fontspec</u>

         Set the font file for FIXED_FONT, roman style.

       fixedbold = <u>fontspec</u>
         Set the font file for FIXED_FONT, bold style.

       fixeditalic = <u>fontspec</u>
         Set the font file for FIXED_FONT, italic style.

       The <b>Frotz</b> homepage is at https://661.org/proj/if/frotz/.

       A  <b><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></b>(1) repository of all versions of <b>Unix</b> <b>Frotz</b> from 2.32 to the bleeding edge is available for public
       perusal at
       <b>https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/frotz/.</b>

       The Interactive Fiction Archive, at <b>https://www.ifarchive.org/</b>, is a good place to  find  games  to  play
       with  <b>Frotz.</b>   To play Infocom's games that use graphics or sound, you'll need to get corresponding Blorb
       files from there.  Various ports and builds for <b>Frotz</b> may also be found at the IF Archive.

       Most distributions of Linux and BSD include <b>Frotz</b> in their package repositories.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The  Z  Machine  itself  has  trouble  with the concept of resizing a terminal.  It assumes that once the
       screen height and width are set, they will never change; even across saves.  This made sense  when  24x80
       terminals were the norm and graphical user interfaces were mostly unknown.  I'm fairly sure there's a way
       around  this problem, but for now, don't resize an xterm in which <b>frotz</b> is running.  Also, you should try
       to make sure the terminal on which you restore a saved game has the same dimensions as the one  on  which
       you saved the game.

       Audio  latency  might  be  unreasonably  long  depending on the settings of your operating system.  Linux
       generally has things right.  The BSDs may need some <b><a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl</a></b>(8) settings adjusted.   See  the  <b><a href="../man4/sound.4.html">sound</a></b>(4)  or
       <b><a href="../man4/audio.4.html">audio</a></b>(4) manpages for more information.
