</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dfrotz - interpreter for Infocom and other Z-Machine games (dumb interface)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dfrotz</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>file</u> [<u>blorb_file</u>]

       At  least  one  file  must be specified on the command line.  This can be either a plain Z-code file or a
       Blorb file.  A Z-code file is a compiled executable for the Z-Machine.   A  Blorb  file  contains  audio,
       graphics, and other things in addition to the game wrapped up into a single file.  It can also optionally
       contain  the Z-Machine executable.  If a plain Z-code file is supplied, then <b>Frotz</b> will check for a Blorb
       file with the same base name but an extension of <b>.blb,</b> <b>.blorb,</b> or <b>.zblorb</b> and load it if found.

       If the file supplied on the command line is a Blorb file, then <b>Frotz</b> will check to see if a  Z-code  file
       is contained within.  If not found, then <b>Frotz</b> will complain and exit.

       An  alternatively-named  Blorb  file can be supplied as the optional second parameter to the command line
       invocation.

       If you want to play any of the games from Infocom that use sound or graphics, you  will  need  to  get  a
       corresponding Blorb file from the Interactive Fiction Archive.  See <b>FURTHER</b> <b>INFORMATION</b> below.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Frotz</b>  is  a Z-Machine interpreter.  The Z-machine is a virtual machine designed by Infocom to run all of
       their text adventures.  It went through multiple revisions during the lifetime of the  company,  and  two
       further  revisions  (V7  and  V8)  were  created  by  Graham  Nelson  after  the  company's  demise.  The
       specification is now quite well documented; this version of <b>Frotz</b> supports version  1.1.   See  <b>Z-MACHINE</b>
       <b>STANDARDS</b> below.

       This version of <b>Frotz</b> fully supports all these versions of the Z-Machine except for version 6.  Version 6
       is  semi-supported  by displaying the outlines of V6 graphics with the picture number in the bottom-right
       corner.

       This manpage is for <b>Frotz</b> with the dumb interface.  <b>Dumb</b> <b>Frotz</b> does not support sound-effects,  graphics,
       colors,  or  even  screen-handling  (for  instance,  <b><a href="../man3/curses.3.html">curses</a></b>(3)).   Its  purpose is to provide a Z-machine
       interpreter with the absolute minimum system requirements or for applications where  those  features  are
       not needed

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>     Watch attribute setting.  Setting and clearing of attributes on objects will be noted in debugging
              messages.

       <b>-A</b>     Watch  attribute  testing.   Every  time  the Z-machine tests an attribute value, the test and the
              result will be reported.

       <b>-f</b> <b>[irc</b> <b>|</b> <b>ansi</b> <b>|</b> <b>normal]</b>
              Select type of format codes.  <b>Dumb</b> <b>Frotz</b> can optionally mark up its output with codes  for  color,
              bold,  underline,  and  so on.  Currently, formatting codes for <b>irc</b> clients and <b>ansi</b> terminals are
              supported.  Specifying <b>normal</b> or not using this flag at all will result  in  <b>Dumb</b>  <b>Frotz's</b>  normal
              behavior of not using any sort of markup.

       <b>-h</b> <b>N</b>   Text  height.   Every  N  lines, a MORE prompt will be printed.  Use of the <b>-m</b> option renders this
              option moot.

       <b>-i</b>     Ignore fatal errors.  If a Z-Machine interpreter encounters a zcode error such as division-by-zero
              or addressing an illegal object, the proper response is to abort execution.  This is done  because
              the  zcode  program doesn't have a clear idea of what is going on.  There are some games out there
              that cause fatal errors because the authors were careless and  used  an  interpreter  that  didn't
              properly  check  for  errors.  This option is intended to get around such bugs, but be warned that
              Strange Things may happen if fatal errors are not caught.

       <b>-I</b> <b>N</b>   Set the interpreter number.  Infocom designed the Z-machine such that a game could  tell  on  what
              kind of machine the interpreter was running.  See INTERPRETER NUMBER below.

       <b>-L</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              When the game starts, load this saved game file.

       <b>-m</b>     Turn off MORE prompts.  This can be desirable when using a printing terminal.

       <b>-o</b>     Watch object movement.  This option enables debugging messages from the interpreter which describe
              the moving of objects in the object tree.

       <b>-O</b>     Watch  object  location.   These  debugging messages detail the locations of objects in the object
              tree.

       <b>-p</b>     Plain ASCII output only.  This inhibits the output of accented letters and other  characters  from
              the  Latin-1 character set, replacing them with reasonable alternatives.  This may be necessary on
              devices lacking these characters.  The OE/oe dipthongs are missing from the  Latin-1  set.   These
              are handled as well.

       <b>-P</b>     Alter  the  <u>@piracy</u>  opcode.   The <u>@piracy</u> opcode was never used by Infocom. This switch is really
              only useful for those who like to toy around with Z-code.

       <b>-q</b>     Quiet mode.  Suppress startup messages such as "Loading zork1.z3".

       <b>-r</b> <b>xxx</b> Set runtime options.  This option may be used repeatedly.  See <b>CONFIGURATION</b> below.  There  is  no
              need to prepend a backslash.

       <b>-R</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Restricted  read/write.   Reading  and writing files will be restricted only to the provided path.
              Ordinarily <b>Frotz</b> will write or read its saves, transcripts, and move recordings in  whatever  path
              or  directory  the user provides when the <b>SAVE,</b> <b>SCRIPT,</b> or <b>RECORDING</b> commands are given.  This can
              be undesirable if <b>Frotz</b> is run in a restricted environment, by a front end, or by a chatbot.  This
              option will cause <b>Frotz</b> to write or read only to the provided path  and  nowhere  else.  Then  the
              controlling  process  can  then  watch that directory for changes and need not worry about someone
              scribbling or snooping who-knows-where.

       <b>-s</b> <b>N</b>   Set the random number seed value.  The given seed value is used as the initial seed value on every
              restart. By default, the random number generator is initialized based on the  system  clock;  this
              allows  you  to  make  the  random  number  generator  predictable, for use in recorded scripts or
              debugging.  For instance, <b>Curses</b> makes random decisions before the first input (such that the  hot
              key Alt-S does not really help).

       <b>-S</b> <b>N</b>   Set the transcript width.  By default your transcript files are formatted to a width of 80 columns
              per line, regardless of the current text width.  This switch allows you to change this setting. In
              particular, use -S 0 to deactivate automatic line splitting in transcript files.

       <b>-t</b>     Sets  the  Z-machine's  <u>Tandy</u>  <u>bit,</u>  which  may affect the behavior of certain Infocom games.  For
              example, Zork I pretends not to have sequels, and Witness has its language toned down.

       <b>-u</b> <b>N</b>   Sets the number of slots available for <b>Frotz's</b> multiple undo hotkey (see below).  This defaults to
              twenty, which should be sufficient for most purposes.  Setting too  high  a  number  here  may  be
              dangerous on machines with limited memory.

       <b>-w</b> <b>N</b>   Manually sets the text width.  This should not be necessary except in special circumstances.

       <b>-x</b>     Expand  the abbreviations "g", "x", and "z" to "again", "examine", and "wait".  This switch is for
              use with old Infocom games that lack these common abbreviations which  were  introduced  in  later
              games.  Use it with caution: A few games might use "g", "x" or "z" for different purposes.

       <b>-v</b>     Show version information and exit.  This will display the version of <b>Frotz,</b> some information about
              what's  enabled  and  what's  not,  the  commit date of the source code, and a <b><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></b>(1) hash of that
              commit.

       <b>-Z</b> <b>N</b>   Error checking mode.
                  0 = don't report errors.
                  1 = report first instance of an error.
                  2 = report all errors.
                  3 = exit after any error.
              Default is 1 (report first instance of an error).

</pre><h4><b>INTERPRETER</b> <b>NUMBER</b></h4><pre>
       The interpreter number is a setting in the Z-machine header which is used to tell the game on  what  sort
       of machine the interpreter is running.  <b>Frotz</b> will automatically choose the most appropriate number for a
       given Infocom-produced game.  Should you want to override the number, the <b>-I</b> option is available.

       An  interpreter  should  choose  the interpreter number most suitable for the machine it will run on.  In
       Versions up to 5, the main  consideration  is  that  the  behaviour  of  'Beyond  Zork'  depends  on  the
       interpreter  number (in terms of its usage of the character graphics font). In Version 6, the decision is
       more serious, as existing Infocom story files depend on interpreter number in many ways:  moreover,  some
       story files expect to be run only on the interpreters for a particular machine.  There are, for instance,
       specifically Amiga versions.  The DECSystem-20 was Infocom's own in-house mainframe.

       For  Infocom's  four V6 games, the interpreter number will be automatically chosen based on the title and
       release number.  Of course, this can be overridden at the command line.

       Infocom used the following interpreter numbers:

              <b>1</b>  <b>DECSystem</b> <b>20</b>
              <b>2</b>  <b>Apple</b> <b>IIe</b>
              <b>3</b>  <b>Macintosh</b>
              <b>4</b>  <b>Amiga</b>
              <b>5</b>  <b>Atari</b> <b>ST</b>
              <b>6</b>  <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b>
              <b>7</b>  <b>Commodore</b> <b>128</b>
              <b>8</b>  <b>Commodore</b> <b>64</b>
              <b>9</b>  <b>Apple</b> <b>IIc</b>
              <b>10</b> <b>Apple</b> <b>IIgs</b>
              <b>11</b> <b>Tandy</b> <b>Color</b>

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Unlike  it's  curses-using  or  SDL-using  siblings,  <b>dfrotz</b>  does  not  use  configuration  files.   All

       <b>.</b>      A blank line emitted as part of span compression.

              (blank) Any other output line.

</pre><h4><b>UNICODE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Dumb</b> <b>Frotz</b> supports Unicode glyphs by way of UTF-8 if the terminal used supports UTF-8.   If  you  prefer
       using xterm, start it as uxterm.  This is a wrapper script that sets up xterm with UTF-8 locale.  You can
       also manually tell an xterm to switch into UTF-8 mode by holding CTRL and the right mouse button to bring
       up  the  VT  FONTS  menu.   Depending on how xterm was installed, you may see an option for "UTF-8 Fonts"
       which will allow Unicode to be properly displayed.

       Getting normal xterm to behave like this all the time can vary from system  to  system.   Other  terminal
       emulators have their own ways of being set to use UTF-8 character encoding.

       If  you  are  using  some  sort  of  wrapper  around  <b>dfrotz,</b>  and want to make use of Unicode, it is the
       responsibility of the wrapper to make sense of characters passed back and forth.

</pre><h4><b>NON</b> <b>ASCII</b> <b>CHARACTERS</b></h4><pre>
       Non-ASCII glyphs can be displayed without the use of UTF-8  by  way  of  the  ISO-8859-1  or  ISO-8859-15
       (Latin-1 or Latin-9) character sets.  ISO-8859-15 is more or less identical to ISO-8859-1 except that the
       OE/oe  dipthongs  are  supported,  replacing  the  seldom-used  1/2  and  1/4  glyphs.   See also <b><a href="../man1/luit.1.html">luit</a></b>(1)
       <b><a href="../man7/charsets.7.html">charsets</a></b>(7) <b><a href="../man7/iso_8859-1.7.html">iso_8859-1</a></b>(7) and <b><a href="../man7/iso_8859-15.7.html">iso_8859-15</a></b>(7) for more information.

   <b>LOCALE</b>
       An important means of ensuring the system knows  to  use  UTF-8  is  to  make  sure  the  locale  is  set
       appropriately.  This is valid only when <b>Dumb</b> <b>Frotz</b> runs under Unix-ish systems.

       Using  the  command  <b>locale</b> will tell you what is currently in use.  Using <b>locale</b> <b>-a</b> will show you what's
       available.  Then set your LANG evironmental variable to something  appropriate  by  using  one  of  these
       commands:

                  export LANG=C.UTF-8
                  export LANG=en_US.utf8

       This  can  be  put  in  your shell configuration file, be it <b>.profile,</b> <b>.bash_profile,</b> <b>.login,</b> <b>.bashrc,</b> or
       whatever.  It can also be set system-wide in the equivalent files in <b>/etc.</b>

</pre><h4><b>Z-MACHINE</b> <b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Frotz</b> complies with the Z-Machine Standard 1.1 of May 2006, revised  February  2014.   The  authoritative
       version is found here:
       <a href="http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point1/index.html">http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point1/index.html</a>

       As  of  1.1, an additional optional parameter <b>prompt</b> is allowed on Version 5 extended save/restore.  This
       parameter allows a game to read or write an auxiliary (aux)  file  without  prompting  the  player.   See
       section  15  of  the  Standard  for  details.   <b>Frotz</b>  restricts  such files to having an ".aux" filename
       extension.  When the <b>-R</b> (restricted read/write) option is active, reads and writes through this mechanism
       are restricted to the provided path the same as all other file accesses.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Unlike it's curses-using or SDL-using siblings, <b>dfrotz</b> does not search any path for game files.

</pre><h4><b>FURTHER</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Frotz</b> homepage is at https://661.org/proj/if/frotz/.

       A <b><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></b>(1) repository of all versions of Unix Frotz from 2.32 to the bleeding edge is available for  public
       perusal at
       <b>https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/frotz/.</b>

       The  Interactive  Fiction  Archive,  at <b>https://www.ifarchive.org/</b>, is a good place to find games to play
       with <b>Frotz.</b>  To play Infocom's games that use graphics or sound, you'll need to get  corresponding  Blorb
       files from there.  Various ports and builds for <b>Frotz</b> may also be found at the IF Archive.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The Z Machine itself has trouble with the concept of resizing a terminal.  It assumes that once the  text
       height  and  width  are  set,  they  will  never  change;  even across saves.  This made sense when 24x80
       terminals were the norm and graphical user interfaces were mostly unknown.  I'm fairly sure there's a way
       around this problem, but for now, don't resize an xterm in which <b>Frotz</b> is running.  Also, you should  try
       to  make  sure the terminal on which you restore a saved game has the same dimensions as the one on which
       you saved the game.
