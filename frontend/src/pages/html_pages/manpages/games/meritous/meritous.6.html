</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       meritous - an action adventure dungeon-crawl game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>meritous</b> [<b>fullscreen</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Meritous is an action-adventure dungeon-crawl game where you play the role of a character with a PSI
       circuit, capable of destroying monsters in a radius around the player.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a
       manual page.

</pre><h4><b>BASIC</b> <b>CONTROLS</b></h4><pre>
       The following the basic controls to the game:

       <b>Arrow</b> <b>keys</b>
           Move around. To walk through doors, simply walk up to them and push against them.

       <b>Space</b>
           Charge your PSI circuit for attack, release to attack.

       <b>Escape</b>
           Exit the game.

       <b>H</b>
           View the help file.

       <b>Tab</b>
           View the map (you can use the arrow keys to scroll around the map, press space to move quickly in the
           map).

       <b>Enter</b>
           Activate a trigger tile that you are standing on. Enter is also used for various other things, such
           as reading in-game dialog.

       <b>P</b>
           Pause the game.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These programs do not follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two
       dashes (`-'). Instead, just type the command after the exectuable name.

       <b>fullscreen</b>
           Runs the game in full screen mode.
