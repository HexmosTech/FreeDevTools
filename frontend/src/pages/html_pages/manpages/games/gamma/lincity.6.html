</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lincity, xlincity - a city/country simulation game.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lincity</b> [<b>-w</b>] [<b>-R</b> <u>red-gamma</u>] [<b>-G</b> <u>green-gamma</u>] [<b>-B</b> <u>blue-gamma</u>] [<b>-m</b> <u>mode</u>]
       <b>xlincity</b> [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-g</b> <u>geometry</u>] [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-r</b>] [<b>-w</b>] [<b>-R</b> <u>red-gamma</u>] [<b>-G</b> <u>green-gamma</u>] [<b>-B</b> <u>blue-gamma</u>]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-w</b>     Use  a  gamma  correction  for  the graphic with the values 1.0 for red, 0.0 for green and 0.4 for
              blue.
              Please note: The gamma values used are not a gamma correction in the traditional way.  Just  check
              it out.

       <b>-R</b> <u>red</u> The  value  for  the  gamma  correction  for  red  color-part.  This option takes a floating point
              argument.

       <b>-G</b> <u>green</u>
              The value for the gamma correction for green  color-part.  This  option  takes  a  floating  point
              argument.

       <b>-B</b> <u>blue</u>
              The  value  for  the  gamma  correction  for  blue  color-part. This option takes a floating point
              argument.

       <b>-m</b> <u>mode</u>
              Set the VGA mode.  This option is ignored on X Windows.  The choices for modes are:
                   lincity -m 10     ## mode 10, 640x480
                   lincity -m 11     ## mode 11, 800x600
                   lincity -m 12     ## mode 12, 1024x768
                   lincity -m 13     ## mode 13, 1280x1024

       <b>-v</b>     Be verbose on startup (this tells the lincity version).

       <b>-g</b> <u>geom</u>
              Specify the X11 geometry argument. E.g. use <b>-g</b> <u>+0+0</u> to put the window to the upper left corner  on
              startup.

       <b>-d</b>     Perform  pix doubling.  Pix doubling renders each pixel as a 2 x 2 square, which has the effect of
              making the game appear twice as large on the screen.  This option only applies to  the  X  Windows
              version.

       <b>-r</b>     Add an extra border around the game.  This option only applies to the X Windows version.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Lincity</b>  is  a  city/country  simulation  game running with SVGA graphics on a Linux console or in an X11
       window under Linux and other platforms.

       You are required to build and maintain a city. You must feed, house, provide  jobs  and  goods  for  your
       residents.  You  can  build a sustainable economy with the help of renewable energy and recycling, or you
       can go for broke and build rockets to escape from a pollution ridden and resource starved planet, it's up
       to you. Due to the finite resources available in any one place, this is not a game that you can leave for
       long periods of time.

       For more about how to play, please read the excellent online help provided with the  game.   Right  click
       almost anywhere to get help.
