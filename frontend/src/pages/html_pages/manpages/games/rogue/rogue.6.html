</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rogue — exploring The Dungeons of Doom

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rogue</b> [<b>-s</b>] [<u>save_file</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rogue</b>  is  a computer fantasy game with a new twist.  It is CRT oriented and the object of the game is to
       survive the attacks of various monsters and get a lot of gold, rather than the puzzle solving orientation
       of most computer fantasy games.

       To get started you really only need to know two commands.  The command <b>?</b> will give  you  a  list  of  the
       available commands and the command <b>/</b> will identify the things you see on the screen.

       To  win  the  game  (as opposed to merely playing to beat other people's high scores) you must locate the
       Amulet of Yendor which is somewhere below the 20th level of the dungeon  and  get  it  out.   Nobody  has
       achieved this yet and if somebody does, they will probably go down in history as a hero among heroes.

       When the game ends, either by your death, when you quit, or if you (by some miracle) manage to win, <b>rogue</b>
       will  give  you a list of the top-ten scorers.  The scoring is based entirely upon how much gold you get.
       There is a 10% penalty for getting yourself killed.

       If <u>save_file</u> is specified, rogue will be restored from the specified saved game file.

       The <b>-s</b> option will print out the list of scores.

       For more detailed directions, read the document <u>A</u> <u>Guide</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>Dungeons</u> <u>of</u> <u>Doom</u>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Probably infinite,  although  none  are  known.   However,  that  Ice  Monsters  sometimes  transfix  you
       permanently is <u>not</u> a bug.  It's a feature.
