       <b>sgt-twiddle</b> - Rotational sliding block puzzle

       <b>sgt-twiddle</b> <b>--version</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Twiddle is a tile-rearrangement puzzle, visually similar to Sixteen (see <u><a href="../man6/sgt-sixteen.6.html">sgt-sixteen</a></u>(6)): you are given a
       grid  of  square  tiles,  each containing a number, and your aim is to arrange the numbers into ascending
       order.

       In basic Twiddle, your move is to rotate a  square  group  of  four  tiles  about  their  common  centre.
       (Orientation  is  not  significant  in  the  basic  puzzle, although you can select it.) On more advanced
       settings, you can rotate a larger square group of tiles.

       I first saw this type of puzzle in the GameCube game ‘Metroid Prime 2’. In the Main Gyro Chamber in  that
       game,  there is a puzzle you solve to unlock a door, which is a special case of Twiddle. I developed this
       game as a generalisation of that puzzle.

</pre><h4><b>Twiddle</b> <b>controls</b></h4><pre>
       To play Twiddle, click the mouse in the centre of the square group you wish to rotate. In the basic mode,
       you rotate a 2×2 square, which means you have to click at a corner point where four tiles meet.

       In more advanced modes you might be rotating 3×3 or even more at a time; if the size of the square is odd
       then you simply click in the centre tile of the square you want to rotate.

       Clicking with the left mouse button rotates the group  anticlockwise.  Clicking  with  the  right  button
       rotates it clockwise.

       You  can  also  move an outline square around the grid with the cursor keys; the square is the size above
       (2×2 by default, or larger). Pressing the return  key  or  space  bar  will  rotate  the  current  square
       anticlockwise or clockwise respectively.

       (All the actions described below are also available.)

</pre><h4><b>Twiddle</b> <b>parameters</b></h4><pre>
       Twiddle provides several configuration options via the ‘Custom’ option on the ‘Type’ menu:

       <b>•</b>      You can configure the width and height of the puzzle grid.

       <b>•</b>      You can configure the size of square block that rotates at a time.

       <b>•</b>      You can ask for every square in the grid to be distinguishable (the default), or you can ask for a
              simplified  puzzle  in  which there are groups of identical numbers. In the simplified puzzle your
              aim is just to arrange all the 1s into the first row, all the 2s into the second row, and so on.

       <b>•</b>      You can configure whether the orientation of tiles matters. If you ask for an  orientable  puzzle,
              each tile will have a triangle drawn in it. All the triangles must be pointing upwards to complete
              the puzzle.

       <b>•</b>      You  can  ask  for  a limited shuffling operation to be performed on the grid. By default, Twiddle
              will shuffle the grid so much that any arrangement is about as probable  as  any  other.  You  can
              override  this  by  requesting a precise number of shuffling moves to be performed. Typically your
              aim is then to determine the precise set of shuffling moves and invert them exactly, so  that  you
              answer  (say) a four-move shuffle with a four-move solution. Note that the more moves you ask for,
              the more likely it is that solutions shorter than the target length will turn out to be possible.

</pre><h4><b>Common</b> <b>actions</b></h4><pre>
       These actions are all available from the ‘Game’ menu and via keyboard shortcuts, in addition to any game-
       specific actions.

       (On Mac OS X, to conform with local user interface standards, these actions are situated  on  the  ‘File’
       and ‘Edit’ menus instead.)

       <u>New</u> <u>game</u> (‘N’, Ctrl+‘N’)
              Starts a new game, with a random initial state.

       <u>Restart</u> <u>game</u>
              Resets the current game to its initial state. (This can be undone.)

       <u>Load</u>   Loads a saved game from a file on disk.

       <u>Save</u>   Saves the current state of your game to a file on disk.

              The Load and Save operations preserve your entire game history (so you can save, reload, and still
              Undo and Redo things you had done before saving).

       <u>Print</u>  Where supported (currently only on Windows), brings up a dialog allowing you to print an arbitrary
              number of puzzles randomly generated from the current parameters, optionally including the current
              puzzle.  (Only for puzzles which make sense to print, of course – it's hard to think of a sensible
              printable representation of Fifteen!)

       <u>Undo</u> (‘U’, Ctrl+‘Z’, Ctrl+‘_’, ‘*’)
              Undoes a single move. (You can undo moves back to the start of the session.)

       <u>Redo</u> (‘R’, Ctrl+‘R’, ‘#’)
              Redoes a previously undone move.

       <u>Copy</u>   Copies the current state of your game to the clipboard in text format, so that you  can  paste  it
              into  (say)  an  e-mail  client  or a web message board if you're discussing the game with someone
              else. (Not all games support this feature.)

       <u>Solve</u>  Transforms the puzzle instantly into its solved state. For some games (Cube) this feature  is  not
              supported at all because it is of no particular use. For other games (such as Pattern), the solved
              state can be used to give you information, if you can't see how a solution can exist at all or you
              want to know where you made a mistake. For still other games (such as Sixteen), automatic solution
              tells  you nothing about how to <u>get</u> to the solution, but it does provide a useful way to get there
              quickly so that you can experiment with set-piece moves and transformations.

              Some games (such as Solo) are capable of solving a game ID you have typed in from elsewhere. Other
              games (such as Rectangles) cannot solve a game ID they didn't invent themself, but when  they  did
              invent  the  game ID they know what the solution is already. Still other games (Pattern) can solve
              <u>some</u> external game IDs, but only if they aren't too difficult.

              The ‘Solve’ command adds the solved state to the end of the undo chain for the  puzzle.  In  other
              words,  if  you want to go back to solving it yourself after seeing the answer, you can just press
              Undo.

       <u>Quit</u> (‘Q’, Ctrl+‘Q’)
              Closes the application entirely.

</pre><h4><b>Specifying</b> <b>games</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>ID</b></h4><pre>
       There are two ways to save a game specification out of a puzzle and recreate it later, or recreate it  in
       somebody else's copy of the same puzzle.

       The ‘Specific’ and ‘Random Seed’ options from the ‘Game’ menu (or the ‘File’ menu, on Mac OS X) each show
       a piece of text (a ‘game ID’) which is sufficient to reconstruct precisely the same game at a later date.

       You  can  enter  either of these pieces of text back into the program (via the same ‘Specific’ or ‘Random
       Seed’ menu options) at a later point, and it will recreate the same game. You can also use either one  as
       a command line argument (on Windows or Unix); see below for more detail.

       The  difference  between  the  two  forms  is  that a descriptive game ID is a literal <u>description</u> of the
       initial state of the game, whereas a random seed is just a piece of arbitrary text which was provided  as
       input to the random number generator used to create the puzzle. This means that:

       <b>•</b>      Descriptive game IDs tend to be longer in many puzzles (although some, such as Cube (<u><a href="../man6/sgt-cube.6.html">sgt-cube</a></u>(6)),
              only  need  very  short  descriptions).  So  a random seed is often a <u>quicker</u> way to note down the
              puzzle you're currently playing, or to tell it to somebody else so they can play the same  one  as
              you.

       <b>•</b>      Any  text  at  all  is  a  valid  random  seed. The automatically generated ones are fifteen-digit
              numbers, but anything will do; you can type in your full name, or a word you just made up,  and  a
              valid  puzzle  will  be  generated  from it. This provides a way for two or more people to race to
              complete the same puzzle: you think of a random seed, then everybody types it in at the same time,
              and nobody has an advantage due to having seen the generated puzzle before anybody else.

       <b>•</b>      It is often possible to convert puzzles from other sources (such as ‘nonograms’ or  ‘sudoku’  from
              newspapers) into descriptive game IDs suitable for use with these programs.

       <b>•</b>      Random  seeds  are  not  guaranteed  to  produce  the same result if you use them with a different
              <u>version</u> of the puzzle program. This is because the generation algorithm might have  been  improved
              or  modified  in  later  versions  of the code, and will therefore produce a different result when
              given the same sequence of random numbers. Use a descriptive game ID if you aren't  sure  that  it
              will be used on the same version of the program as yours.

              (Use the ‘About’ menu option to find out the version number of the program. Programs with the same
              version number running on different platforms should still be random-seed compatible.)

       A  descriptive game ID starts with a piece of text which encodes the <u>parameters</u> of the current game (such
       as grid size). Then there is a colon, and after that is the description of the game's  initial  state.  A
       random  seed  starts  with  a  similar string of parameters, but then it contains a hash sign followed by
       arbitrary data.

       If you enter a descriptive game ID, the program will not be able  to  show  you  the  random  seed  which
       generated  it,  since  it  wasn't  generated <u>from</u> a random seed. If you <u>enter</u> a random seed, however, the
       program will be able to show you the descriptive game ID derived from that random seed.

       Note that the game parameter strings are not always identical between the  two  forms.  For  some  games,
       there  will be parameter data provided with the random seed which is not included in the descriptive game
       ID. This is because that parameter information is only relevant when <u>generating</u> puzzle grids, and is  not
       important  when  playing  them.  Thus,  for  example,  the  difficulty level in Solo (<u><a href="../man6/sgt-solo.6.html">sgt-solo</a></u>(6)) is not
       mentioned in the descriptive game ID.

       These additional parameters are also not set permanently if you type in a game ID. For  example,  suppose
       you  have  Solo  set  to  ‘Advanced’ difficulty level, and then a friend wants your help with a ‘Trivial’
       puzzle; so the friend reads out a random seed specifying ‘Trivial’ difficulty, and you type  it  in.  The
       program will generate you the same ‘Trivial’ grid which your friend was having trouble with, but once you
       have  finished  playing  it,  when you ask for a new game it will automatically go back to the ‘Advanced’
       difficulty which it was previously set on.

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>‘Type’</b> <b>menu</b></h4><pre>
       The ‘Type’ menu, if present, may contain a list of preset game settings.  Selecting  one  of  these  will
       start a new random game with the parameters specified.

       The  ‘Type’  menu  may  also contain a ‘Custom’ option which allows you to fine-tune game parameters. The
       parameters available are specific to each game and are described in the following sections.

</pre><h4><b>Specifying</b> <b>game</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b></h4><pre>
       (This section does not apply to the Mac OS X version.)

       The games in this collection deliberately do not ever save information on to the computer  they  run  on:
       they  have  no high score tables and no saved preferences. (This is because I expect at least some people
       to play them at work, and those people will probably appreciate leaving as little evidence as possible!)

       However, if you do want to arrange for one of these games to default to a particular set  of  parameters,
       you can specify them on the command line.

       The  easiest  way  to do this is to set up the parameters you want using the ‘Type’ menu (see above), and
       then to select ‘Random Seed’ from the ‘Game’ or ‘File’ menu (see above). The text in the  ‘Game  ID’  box
       will  be  composed  of  two  parts,  separated  by  a  hash. The first of these parts represents the game
       parameters (the size of the playing area, for example, and anything else you set using the ‘Type’ menu).

       If you run the game with just that parameter text on the command line, it will start up with the settings
       you specified.

       For example: if you run Cube (see <u><a href="../man6/sgt-cube.6.html">sgt-cube</a></u>(6)), select ‘Octahedron’ from the ‘Type’ menu, and then go  to
       the  game  ID  selection,  you  will  see a string of the form ‘<b>o2x2#338686542711620</b>’. Take only the part
       before the hash (‘<b>o2x2</b>’), and start Cube with that text on the command line: ‘<b>sgt-cube</b> <b>o2x2</b>’.

       If you copy the <u>entire</u> game ID on to the command line, the game will start up in the specific  game  that
       was  described.  This is occasionally a more convenient way to start a particular game ID than by pasting
       it into the game ID selection box.

       (You could also retrieve the encoded game parameters using the ‘Specific’ menu option instead of  ‘Random
       Seed’,  but if you do then some options, such as the difficulty level in Solo, will be missing. See above
       for more details on this.)

</pre><h4><b>Unix</b> <b>command-line</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       (This section only applies to the Unix port.)

       In addition to being able to specify game parameters on the command line (see above), there  are  various
       other options:

       <b>--game</b>

       <b>--load</b> These  options  respectively  determine whether the command-line argument is treated as specifying
              game parameters or a save file to load. Only one should be specified. If neither of these  options
              is specified, a guess is made based on the format of the argument.

       <b>--generate</b> <u>n</u>
              If this option is specified, instead of a puzzle being displayed, a number of descriptive game IDs
              will  be  invented  and  printed on standard output. This is useful for gaining access to the game
              generation algorithms without necessarily using the frontend.

              If game parameters are specified on the command-line, they will be used to generate the game  IDs;
              otherwise a default set of parameters will be used.

              The  most common use of this option is in conjunction with <b>--print</b>, in which case its behaviour is
              slightly different; see below.

       <b>--print</b> <u>w</u><b>x</b><u>h</u>
              If this option is specified, instead of a puzzle being displayed, a printed representation of  one
              or more unsolved puzzles is sent to standard output, in PostScript format.

              On  each  page  of puzzles, there will be <u>w</u> across and <u>h</u> down. If there are more puzzles than <u>w</u>×<u>h</u>,
              more than one page will be printed.

              If <b>--generate</b> has also been specified, the invented game IDs will be used to generate the  printed
              output.  Otherwise,  a list of game IDs is expected on standard input (which can be descriptive or
              random seeds; see above), in the same format produced by <b>--generate</b>.

              For example:

              sgt-net --generate 12 --print 2x3 7x7w | lpr

              will generate two pages of printed Net puzzles (each of which will have a 7×7 wrapping grid),  and
              pipe the output to the <b>lpr</b> command, which on many systems will send them to an actual printer.

              There are various other options which affect printing; see below.

       <b>--save</b> <u>file-prefix</u> [ <b>--save-suffix</b> <u>file-suffix</u> ]
              If this option is specified, instead of a puzzle being displayed, saved-game files for one or more
              unsolved puzzles are written to files constructed from the supplied prefix and/or suffix.

              If  <b>--generate</b> has also been specified, the invented game IDs will be used to generate the printed
              output. Otherwise, a list of game IDs is expected on standard input (which can be  descriptive  or
              random seeds; see above), in the same format produced by <b>--generate</b>.

              For example:

              sgt-net --generate 12 --save game --save-suffix .sav

              will generate twelve Net saved-game files with the names <b>game0.sav</b> to <b>game11.sav</b>.

       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information about the game, and then quits.

       The following options are only meaningful if <b>--print</b> is also specified:

       <b>--with-solutions</b>
              The set of pages filled with unsolved puzzles will be followed by the solutions to those puzzles.

       <b>--scale</b> <u>n</u>
              Adjusts  how  big  each puzzle is when printed. Larger numbers make puzzles bigger; the default is
              1.0.

       <b>--colour</b>
              Puzzles will be printed in colour, rather than in black and white (if supported by the puzzle).
