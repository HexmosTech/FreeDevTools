       <b>sgt-bridges</b> - Bridge-placing puzzle

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sgt-bridges</b> [<b>--generate</b> <u>n</u>] [<b>--print</b> <u>w</u><b>x</b><u>h</u> [<b>--with-solutions</b>] [<b>--scale</b> <u>n</u>] [<b>--colour</b>]] [<u>game-parameters</u>|<u>game-</u>

       <b>sgt-bridges</b> <b>--version</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You have a set of islands distributed across the playing area. Each island contains a number. Your aim is
       to connect the islands together with bridges, in such a way that:

       <b>•</b>      Bridges run horizontally or vertically.

       <b>•</b>      The number of bridges terminating at any island is equal to the number written in that island.

       <b>•</b>      Two bridges may run in parallel between the same two islands, but no more than two may do so.

       <b>•</b>      No bridge crosses another bridge.

       <b>•</b>      All the islands are connected together.

       There  are  some  configurable  alternative  modes,  which  involve changing the parallel-bridge limit to
       something other than 2, and introducing the additional constraint that no sequence of bridges may form  a
       loop from one island back to the same island. The rules stated above are the default ones.

       Credit for this puzzle goes to Nikoli (<b>https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/Hashiwokakero/</b>).

       Bridges was contributed to this collection by James Harvey.

</pre><h4><b>Bridges</b> <b>controls</b></h4><pre>
       To  place a bridge between two islands, click the mouse down on one island and drag it towards the other.
       You do not need to drag all the way to the other island; you only need to move the mouse far  enough  for
       the  intended bridge direction to be unambiguous. (So you can keep the mouse near the starting island and
       conveniently throw bridges out from it in many directions.)

       Doing this again when a bridge is already present will add another parallel bridge. If there are  already
       as many bridges between the two islands as permitted by the current game rules (i.e. two by default), the
       same dragging action will remove all of them.

       If  you  want  to  remind yourself that two islands definitely <u>do</u> <u>not</u> have a bridge between them, you can
       right-drag between them in the same way to draw a ‘non-bridge’ marker.

       If you think you have finished with an island (i.e. you have placed all its  bridges  and  are  confident
       that they are in the right places), you can mark the island as finished by left-clicking on it. This will
       highlight  it  and all the bridges connected to it, and you will be prevented from accidentally modifying
       any of those bridges in future. Left-clicking again on a highlighted island will unmark  it  and  restore
       your ability to modify it.

       You  can  also  use  the  cursor  keys  to  move around the grid: if possible the cursor will always move
       orthogonally, otherwise it will move towards the nearest  island  to  the  indicated  direction.  Holding
       Control  and pressing a cursor key will lay a bridge in that direction (if available); Shift and a cursor
       key will lay a ‘non-bridge’ marker. Pressing the return key followed by a cursor  key  will  also  lay  a
       bridge in that direction.

       You can mark an island as finished by pressing the space bar or by pressing the return key twice.

       By  pressing  a  number  key,  you can jump to the nearest island with that number. Letters ‘a’, ..., ‘f’
       count as 10, ..., 15 and ‘0’ as 16.

       Violations of the puzzle rules will be marked in red:

       <b>•</b>      An island with too many bridges will be highlighted in red.

       <b>•</b>      An island with too few bridges will be highlighted in red if it is definitely an error (as opposed
              to merely not being finished yet): if adding enough bridges would involve having to cross  another
              bridge or remove a non-bridge marker, or if the island has been highlighted as complete.

       <b>•</b>      A  group  of  islands and bridges may be highlighted in red if it is a closed subset of the puzzle
              with no way to connect it to the rest of the islands. For example, if you directly connect two  1s
              together  with  a bridge and they are not the only two islands on the grid, they will light up red
              to indicate that such a group cannot be contained in any valid solution.

       <b>•</b>      If you have selected the (non-default) option to disallow  loops  in  the  solution,  a  group  of
              bridges which forms a loop will be highlighted.

       (All the actions described below are also available.)

</pre><h4><b>Bridges</b> <b>parameters</b></h4><pre>
       These parameters are available from the ‘Custom...’ option on the ‘Type’ menu.

       <u>Width</u>, <u>Height</u>
              Size of grid in squares.

       <u>Difficulty</u>
              Difficulty level of puzzle.

       <u>Allow</u> <u>loops</u>
              This  is  set by default. If cleared, puzzles will be generated in such a way that they are always
              soluble without creating a loop, and solutions which do involve a loop will be disallowed.

       <u>Max.</u> <u>bridges</u> <u>per</u> <u>direction</u>
              Maximum number of bridges in any particular direction. The default is 2, but you can change it  to
              1, 3 or 4. In general, fewer is easier.

       <u>%age</u> <u>of</u> <u>island</u> <u>squares</u>
              Gives  a  rough  percentage of islands the generator will try and lay before finishing the puzzle.
              Certain layouts will not manage to lay enough islands; this is an upper bound.

       <u>Expansion</u> <u>factor</u> <u>(%age)</u>
              The grid generator works by picking an existing island at random (after first creating an  initial
              island somewhere). It then decides on a direction (at random), and then works out how far it could
              extend before creating another island. This parameter determines how likely it is to extend as far
              as it can, rather than choosing somewhere closer.

              High  expansion  factors  usually  mean  easier puzzles with fewer possible islands; low expansion
              factors can create lots of tightly-packed islands.

</pre><h4><b>Common</b> <b>actions</b></h4><pre>
       These actions are all available from the ‘Game’ menu and via keyboard shortcuts, in addition to any game-
       specific actions.

       (On Mac OS X, to conform with local user interface standards, these actions are situated  on  the  ‘File’
       and ‘Edit’ menus instead.)

       <u>New</u> <u>game</u> (‘N’, Ctrl+‘N’)
              Starts a new game, with a random initial state.

       <u>Restart</u> <u>game</u>
              Resets the current game to its initial state. (This can be undone.)

       <u>Load</u>   Loads a saved game from a file on disk.

       <u>Save</u>   Saves the current state of your game to a file on disk.

              The Load and Save operations preserve your entire game history (so you can save, reload, and still
              Undo and Redo things you had done before saving).

       <u>Print</u>  Where supported (currently only on Windows), brings up a dialog allowing you to print an arbitrary
              number of puzzles randomly generated from the current parameters, optionally including the current
              puzzle.  (Only for puzzles which make sense to print, of course – it's hard to think of a sensible
              printable representation of Fifteen!)

       <u>Undo</u> (‘U’, Ctrl+‘Z’, Ctrl+‘_’, ‘*’)
              Undoes a single move. (You can undo moves back to the start of the session.)

       <u>Redo</u> (‘R’, Ctrl+‘R’, ‘#’)
              Redoes a previously undone move.

       <u>Copy</u>   Copies the current state of your game to the clipboard in text format, so that you  can  paste  it
              into  (say)  an  e-mail  client  or a web message board if you're discussing the game with someone
              else. (Not all games support this feature.)

       <u>Solve</u>  Transforms the puzzle instantly into its solved state. For some games (Cube) this feature  is  not
              supported at all because it is of no particular use. For other games (such as Pattern), the solved
              state can be used to give you information, if you can't see how a solution can exist at all or you
              want to know where you made a mistake. For still other games (such as Sixteen), automatic solution
              tells  you nothing about how to <u>get</u> to the solution, but it does provide a useful way to get there
              quickly so that you can experiment with set-piece moves and transformations.

              Some games (such as Solo) are capable of solving a game ID you have typed in from elsewhere. Other
              games (such as Rectangles) cannot solve a game ID they didn't invent themself, but when  they  did
              invent  the  game ID they know what the solution is already. Still other games (Pattern) can solve
              <u>some</u> external game IDs, but only if they aren't too difficult.

              The ‘Solve’ command adds the solved state to the end of the undo chain for the  puzzle.  In  other
              words,  if  you want to go back to solving it yourself after seeing the answer, you can just press
              Undo.

       <u>Quit</u> (‘Q’, Ctrl+‘Q’)
              Closes the application entirely.

</pre><h4><b>Specifying</b> <b>games</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>ID</b></h4><pre>
       There are two ways to save a game specification out of a puzzle and recreate it later, or recreate it  in
       somebody else's copy of the same puzzle.

       The ‘Specific’ and ‘Random Seed’ options from the ‘Game’ menu (or the ‘File’ menu, on Mac OS X) each show
       a piece of text (a ‘game ID’) which is sufficient to reconstruct precisely the same game at a later date.

       You  can  enter  either of these pieces of text back into the program (via the same ‘Specific’ or ‘Random
       Seed’ menu options) at a later point, and it will recreate the same game. You can also use either one  as
       a command line argument (on Windows or Unix); see below for more detail.

       The  difference  between  the  two  forms  is  that a descriptive game ID is a literal <u>description</u> of the
       initial state of the game, whereas a random seed is just a piece of arbitrary text which was provided  as
       input to the random number generator used to create the puzzle. This means that:

       <b>•</b>      Descriptive game IDs tend to be longer in many puzzles (although some, such as Cube (<u><a href="../man6/sgt-cube.6.html">sgt-cube</a></u>(6)),
              only  need  very  short  descriptions).  So  a random seed is often a <u>quicker</u> way to note down the
              puzzle you're currently playing, or to tell it to somebody else so they can play the same  one  as
              you.

       <b>•</b>      Any  text  at  all  is  a  valid  random  seed. The automatically generated ones are fifteen-digit
              numbers, but anything will do; you can type in your full name, or a word you just made up,  and  a
              valid  puzzle  will  be  generated  from it. This provides a way for two or more people to race to
              complete the same puzzle: you think of a random seed, then everybody types it in at the same time,
              and nobody has an advantage due to having seen the generated puzzle before anybody else.

       <b>•</b>      It is often possible to convert puzzles from other sources (such as ‘nonograms’ or  ‘sudoku’  from
              newspapers) into descriptive game IDs suitable for use with these programs.

       <b>•</b>      Random  seeds  are  not  guaranteed  to  produce  the same result if you use them with a different
              <u>version</u> of the puzzle program. This is because the generation algorithm might have  been  improved
              or  modified  in  later  versions  of the code, and will therefore produce a different result when
              given the same sequence of random numbers. Use a descriptive game ID if you aren't  sure  that  it
              will be used on the same version of the program as yours.

              (Use the ‘About’ menu option to find out the version number of the program. Programs with the same
              version number running on different platforms should still be random-seed compatible.)

       A  descriptive game ID starts with a piece of text which encodes the <u>parameters</u> of the current game (such
       as grid size). Then there is a colon, and after that is the description of the game's  initial  state.  A
       random  seed  starts  with  a  similar string of parameters, but then it contains a hash sign followed by
       arbitrary data.

       If you enter a descriptive game ID, the program will not be able  to  show  you  the  random  seed  which
       generated  it,  since  it  wasn't  generated <u>from</u> a random seed. If you <u>enter</u> a random seed, however, the
       program will be able to show you the descriptive game ID derived from that random seed.

       Note that the game parameter strings are not always identical between the  two  forms.  For  some  games,
       there  will be parameter data provided with the random seed which is not included in the descriptive game
       ID. This is because that parameter information is only relevant when <u>generating</u> puzzle grids, and is  not
       important  when  playing  them.  Thus,  for  example,  the  difficulty level in Solo (<u><a href="../man6/sgt-solo.6.html">sgt-solo</a></u>(6)) is not
       mentioned in the descriptive game ID.

       These additional parameters are also not set permanently if you type in a game ID. For  example,  suppose
       you  have  Solo  set  to  ‘Advanced’ difficulty level, and then a friend wants your help with a ‘Trivial’
       puzzle; so the friend reads out a random seed specifying ‘Trivial’ difficulty, and you type  it  in.  The
       program will generate you the same ‘Trivial’ grid which your friend was having trouble with, but once you
       have  finished  playing  it,  when you ask for a new game it will automatically go back to the ‘Advanced’
       difficulty which it was previously set on.

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>‘Type’</b> <b>menu</b></h4><pre>
       The ‘Type’ menu, if present, may contain a list of preset game settings.  Selecting  one  of  these  will
       start a new random game with the parameters specified.

       The  ‘Type’  menu  may  also contain a ‘Custom’ option which allows you to fine-tune game parameters. The
       parameters available are specific to each game and are described in the following sections.

</pre><h4><b>Specifying</b> <b>game</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b></h4><pre>
       (This section does not apply to the Mac OS X version.)

       The games in this collection deliberately do not ever save information on to the computer  they  run  on:
       they  have  no high score tables and no saved preferences. (This is because I expect at least some people
       to play them at work, and those people will probably appreciate leaving as little evidence as possible!)

       However, if you do want to arrange for one of these games to default to a particular set  of  parameters,
       you can specify them on the command line.

       The  easiest  way  to do this is to set up the parameters you want using the ‘Type’ menu (see above), and
       then to select ‘Random Seed’ from the ‘Game’ or ‘File’ menu (see above). The text in the  ‘Game  ID’  box
       will  be  composed  of  two  parts,  separated  by  a  hash. The first of these parts represents the game
       parameters (the size of the playing area, for example, and anything else you set using the ‘Type’ menu).

       If you run the game with just that parameter text on the command line, it will start up with the settings
       you specified.

       For example: if you run Cube (see <u><a href="../man6/sgt-cube.6.html">sgt-cube</a></u>(6)), select ‘Octahedron’ from the ‘Type’ menu, and then go  to
       the  game  ID  selection,  you  will  see a string of the form ‘<b>o2x2#338686542711620</b>’. Take only the part
       before the hash (‘<b>o2x2</b>’), and start Cube with that text on the command line: ‘<b>sgt-cube</b> <b>o2x2</b>’.

       If you copy the <u>entire</u> game ID on to the command line, the game will start up in the specific  game  that
       was  described.  This is occasionally a more convenient way to start a particular game ID than by pasting
       it into the game ID selection box.

       (You could also retrieve the encoded game parameters using the ‘Specific’ menu option instead of  ‘Random
       Seed’,  but if you do then some options, such as the difficulty level in Solo, will be missing. See above
       for more details on this.)

</pre><h4><b>Unix</b> <b>command-line</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       (This section only applies to the Unix port.)

       In addition to being able to specify game parameters on the command line (see above), there  are  various
       other options:

       <b>--game</b>

       <b>--load</b> These  options  respectively  determine whether the command-line argument is treated as specifying
              game parameters or a save file to load. Only one should be specified. If neither of these  options
              is specified, a guess is made based on the format of the argument.

       <b>--generate</b> <u>n</u>
              If this option is specified, instead of a puzzle being displayed, a number of descriptive game IDs
              will  be  invented  and  printed on standard output. This is useful for gaining access to the game
              generation algorithms without necessarily using the frontend.

              If game parameters are specified on the command-line, they will be used to generate the game  IDs;
              otherwise a default set of parameters will be used.

              The  most common use of this option is in conjunction with <b>--print</b>, in which case its behaviour is
              slightly different; see below.

       <b>--print</b> <u>w</u><b>x</b><u>h</u>
              If this option is specified, instead of a puzzle being displayed, a printed representation of  one
              or more unsolved puzzles is sent to standard output, in PostScript format.

              On  each  page  of puzzles, there will be <u>w</u> across and <u>h</u> down. If there are more puzzles than <u>w</u>×<u>h</u>,
              more than one page will be printed.

              If <b>--generate</b> has also been specified, the invented game IDs will be used to generate the  printed
              output.  Otherwise,  a list of game IDs is expected on standard input (which can be descriptive or
              random seeds; see above), in the same format produced by <b>--generate</b>.

              For example:

              sgt-net --generate 12 --print 2x3 7x7w | lpr

              will generate two pages of printed Net puzzles (each of which will have a 7×7 wrapping grid),  and
              pipe the output to the <b>lpr</b> command, which on many systems will send them to an actual printer.

              There are various other options which affect printing; see below.

       <b>--save</b> <u>file-prefix</u> [ <b>--save-suffix</b> <u>file-suffix</u> ]
              If this option is specified, instead of a puzzle being displayed, saved-game files for one or more
              unsolved puzzles are written to files constructed from the supplied prefix and/or suffix.

              If  <b>--generate</b> has also been specified, the invented game IDs will be used to generate the printed
              output. Otherwise, a list of game IDs is expected on standard input (which can be  descriptive  or
              random seeds; see above), in the same format produced by <b>--generate</b>.

              For example:

              sgt-net --generate 12 --save game --save-suffix .sav

              will generate twelve Net saved-game files with the names <b>game0.sav</b> to <b>game11.sav</b>.

       <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information about the game, and then quits.

       The following options are only meaningful if <b>--print</b> is also specified:

       <b>--with-solutions</b>
              The set of pages filled with unsolved puzzles will be followed by the solutions to those puzzles.

       <b>--scale</b> <u>n</u>
              Adjusts  how  big  each puzzle is when printed. Larger numbers make puzzles bigger; the default is
              1.0.

       <b>--colour</b>
              Puzzles will be printed in colour, rather than in black and white (if supported by the puzzle).
