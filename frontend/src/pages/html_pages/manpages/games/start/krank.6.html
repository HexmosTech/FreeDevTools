</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       krank  is a game of dexterity, being somewhere between Breakout and billiard, where the aim of each level
       is to shove floating stones towards compatible static stones. You control a short chain  of  stones  with
       your mouse to achieve that.

       <b>Krank</b> contains the following elements:

           <b>the</b> <b>snake</b>
               - follows your mouse or the analog stick of your joypad.
           <b>the</b> <b>balls</b>
               - move if you touch them with the snake or another ball.
           <b>the</b> <b>links</b>
               - are like balls, but they bond together if they touch each other.
           <b>the</b> <b>stones</b>
               - never move and do nothing else.
           <b>the</b> <b>magnets</b>
               - unmovable themselves, attract everything that moves. the number of circles rotating around them
               indicates how many items may get captured in them.

               A magnet will vanish if:
                    - it captured at least as many balls as circles are rotating around it;
                    - all the captured balls have the same color as the magnet;
                    - it stayed for 3 seconds in the above condition.

               If  a  magnet is fully loaded, but includes links or balls of a different color, it will explode,
               but not vanish.

           <b>the</b> <b>anchors</b>
               - never move, but bond together with links. the number of circles rotating around them  indicates
               how many links may bond with them.

               An anchor will vanish if:
                    - it is connected to as many other anchors as circles are rotating around it;
                    - all the connected anchors and links have the same color as the anchor;
                    - all other anchors of the same color are fully connected.

               If all the above conditions are valid for 3 seconds, those anchors will be removed.

               If  an  anchor  is  connected  to  another  anchor,  but the connecting chain includes links of a
               different color, it will explode, but not vanish.

           A connection between two links will be broken if one link is touched by  a  ball  or  captured  by  a
           magnet.

           For each level you solve, there will be two more levels available to play, so you can skip levels you
           don't like.

</pre><h4><b>AIM</b></h4><pre>
