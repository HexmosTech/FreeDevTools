</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       icebreaker - An addictive action-puzzle game for X.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>icebreaker</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       So,  uh, there's a bunch of penguins on an iceberg in Antarctica. You have been selected to catch them so
       they can be shipped to Finland, where they are essential to a secret plot for world domination.

       In order to trap the penguins, you'll need to break the  iceberg  into  small  chunks  by  melting  lines
       without hitting any of the birds. Once 80% or more of the 'berg is gone, you advance to the next level.

       Use  the  left  mouse  button  to  start  lines,  and  the right (and/or middle) button to toggle between
       horizontal and vertical. Beyond that, it's probably easier for you go figure out the game by playing than
       by reading. So go.

       Go!

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-n,</b> <b>--nosound</b>
              do not attempt to initialize sound system. Causes the in-game Sound option to be marked  N/A,  and
              the config file setting to be ignored.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--fullscreen</b>
              start in fullscreen mode if possible. Ignores config file setting.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--windowed</b>
              start  in  windowed  mode. Resets config file so that this is the default. You probably won't ever
              need to use this, but it's there in case fullscreen somehow is broken and you're too lazy to  edit
              the config file manually.

       <b>-t</b><u>themename</u><b>,</b> <b>--theme=</b><u>themename</u>
              select theme <u>themename</u> -- overrides config file. For more information on themes, see README.themes
              or the IceBreaker web site.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--listthemes</b>
              show available themes.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              display version and copyright information

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              display simple command-line option help screen
