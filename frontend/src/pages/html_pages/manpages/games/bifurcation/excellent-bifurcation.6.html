</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       excellent-bifurcation - an abstract two-sided vertical shooter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>excellent-bifurcation</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  aliens have attacked, and their ability to exist in either or both of their world and ours has given
       them an almost unsurpassable advantage.

       Take command of a special fighter craft capable of existing in both realities  at  once  and  drive  them
       back!

       The  form  your  fighter takes on the left has double fast-firing cannons and can charge to release up to
       eight seekers. It is ideal for destroying small and weak but numerous enemies. The right-hand form has  a
       single  powerful  cannon  which  fires  slowly but does far more damage, and is more suited to taking out
       larger enemies.  It can charge up to release a wave which passes through things, damaging them as it goes
       (unlike the beam weapons, which only hit anything once no matter how thick it is). You  can  switch  them
       between the worlds depending on what kind of firepower you need where.

</pre><h4><b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Left,</b> <b>Right,</b> <b>Up,</b> <b>Down</b>
              move the fighter across the screen

       <b>Z</b>      fire the main weapon

       <b>X</b>      charges your weapons

       <b>C</b>      switches your two forms between the two worlds (screens)

       <b>A</b>      turns on or off the autofire mode (autofire is just like holding down Z)

       <b>Esc</b>    return to the main menu

       Key controls can be modified inside the game options menu.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>excellent-bifurcation</b>  doesn't  accept  any  command  line  arguments.   Configuration  is  via  the file
       <b><a href="file:~/.config/excellent-bifurcation/init.txt">~/.config/excellent-bifurcation/init.txt</a></b> (or a different path if the environment variable <b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b>
       has been modified), which also records scores and configured key controls.

       The following configuration can only be done by editing <b>init.txt</b> (under the heading <b>[Misc]</b>):

       <b>Windowed</b>
              Use <b>Windowed</b> <b>=</b> <b>0</b> for fullscreen, <b>Windowed</b> <b>=</b> <b>1</b> to run in a window (default).

       <b>vsync</b>  Turning vsync on (<b>vsync</b> <b>=</b> <b>1</b>) eliminates a graphic shearing effect which  some  people  might  find
              annoying, but can slow things down on older systems.  Default is <b>vsync</b> <b>=</b> <b>0</b>.
