</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       asylum - a surreal platform shooting game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>asylum</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Young Sigmund has a few problems.  To help him resolve his mental instability, you must enter the surreal
       world of his inner mind and shut down the malfunctioning brain cells.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>PLAY</b></h4><pre>
       The game revolves around shooting anything which moves, collecting anything which doesn't move, and, most
       importantly,  finding  your  way  to each of the eight pulsating neurons scattered throughout the immense
       map.  Use <b>Z</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>;</b> and <b>.</b>  to move and <b>Enter</b> to fire, or remap the keys to something you like better.

       The one game feature which does merit explicit instruction is teleporting.  In the  first  level  ("Ego")
       the  teleporters look like candelabra.  To use a teleporter, stand in its centre and press "down" (that's
       <b>.</b>  with the default key settings).

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       The original Acorn Archimedes game was created by Andy  Southgate.   This  version  is  a  port  by  Hugh
       Robinson.
