       purity - a general purpose purity test

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/usr/games/purity</b> <b>[</b> <u>flags</u> ] [ <u>testname</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Purity is an interactive purity test program with a simple, user interface and datafile format.  For each
       test,  questions  are  printed  to  the  your terminal, and you are prompted for an answer to the current
       question.  At a prompt, these are your choices:

              y      Answer "yes" to the question.

              n      Answer "no" to the question.

              b      Backup one question, if you answered it incorrectly, or someone is watching  you  take  the
                     test, and you don't (or do) want to admit a different answer.

              r      Redraw the current question.

              q      Quit the test, and print the current score.

              ?      Print a help screen for the current prompt.

              k      <u>Kill</u>  a  section  of  the  test.   This  skips all the questions of the test until the next
                     subject heading.

              a      Toggle answer mode between <u>real</u> answers and <u>obfuscated</u> answers.  <u>Real</u> answers  print  "yes"
                     and  "no",  while  <u>obfuscated</u>  answers  are  "Maybe"  and  "maybe".  Obfuscated answers are
                     preferred if you are shy, and don't want people to be able to read your answers  over  your
                     shoulder as you take the test.

              d      Toggle dERanGe output.

              s      Print your current score on the test you are taking.

              l      Toggle score logging.

       At  the  end  of  the  test,  your score is printed out.  For most purity tests, lower scores denote more
       "experience" of the test material.

</pre><h4><b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       These are the command line flags for the test.

              -a     Show <u>real</u> answers (i.e. "yes" and "no")  instead  of  <u>obfuscated</u>  ones  (i.e.  "Maybe"  and
                     "maybe") as you answer the questions.

              -d     PrINt THe tESt in DerANgeD pRInT.

              -f     Take the test in <u>fast</u> mode.  Only the questions are printed, and not any other text blocks,
                     like the introdution, subject headers, and the conclusion.

              -l     Take the test without having your score logged.

              -p     Print the test without prompting for answers.  This is useful for making hard copies of the
                     tests without having to edit out the prompts by hand.

              -r     Decrypt  the test using the <u>Rot</u> <u>13</u> algorithm.  This is done as a form of "protection", such
                     that if you read a rot13 test and it offends you, it's your own fault.

              -z     <u>zoom</u> through more prompts in large text blocks.  The default is to prompt the user for <u>more</u>
                     when a screenful of text has been printed without any user input.

</pre><h4><b>DATAFILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The format of the datafiles is a very simple format, intended such that new tests can quickly and  easily
       be converted to run with the test.

       There  are  four  types  of  text in a purity test datafile.  Each type is contained in a <u>bracket</u> type of
       punctuation.  The definitions are as follows:

       the styles of text blocks are:

              { plain text block }

              [ subject header ]

              ( test question )

              and  &lt; conclusion &gt;

       Plain text blocks are printed out character for character.

       Subject headers are preceded by their subject numbers, starting at 1, and then printed as text blocks.

       Questions are preceded by their numbers, and then prompt the user to answer the question,  keeping  track
       of the user's current score.

       Conclusions  first  calculate and print the user's score for the test, then print out the conclusion as a
       text block.

       If you wish to include any of the various bracket punctuation in your text, the backslash ("\") character
       will <u>escape</u> the next character.

       To print a question with parentheses, you would use the following format:

       (have you ever written a purity test \(like this one\)?)

       the output would be this:

          1.  have you ever written a purity test (like this one)?

       and then it would have asked the user for her/his answer.

       For a generic datafile, use the "sample" datafile for the test.
