</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sopwith - classic aerial combat shoot em up game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sopwith</b> [ -n | -s | -c | -l | -j <u>host</u> ] [-f] [-g<u>level</u>] [-m <u>filename</u>] [-q]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sopwith  is  a  modern port of the classic 1980s shoot 'em up game of the same name. The game has a World
       War I aviation theme. The object of Sopwith is to destroy all  enemy  targets  with  a  somewhat  limited
       airforce.

       It can be played both in single player and multiplayer mode over a TCP/IP network.

       Sopwith   looks   for   a   configuration  file  in  the  user's  home  directory  at  <u><a href="file:~/.local/share/SDL">~/.local/share/SDL</a></u>
       <u>Sopwith/sopwith.cfg</u>; the configuration file is only generated after the user changes one of the  settings
       from the in-game options menu. Details about the contents of this file can be found in <b><a href="../man5/sopwith.cfg.5.html">sopwith.cfg</a></b>(5).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -n     Start  a  single  player  game in novice mode. In novice mode there are no oxen or birds, you have
              infinite ammo and bombs, and it is not possible to stall the plane. This is a good option  if  you
              are  new  to  the  game, or if you're just interested in more casual gameplay without so much of a
              challenge.

       -s     Start a single player game in expert mode

       -c     Start a single player vs. computer game

       -l     Start a network game listening for a network connection.  See the  section  "MULTIPLAYER  SERVERS"
              below for more details.

       -p     Use a different TCP port for multiplayer games than the default (3847).

       -j <u>host:port</u>
              Start  a network game, connecting to another listening host as specified by <u>host:port</u>. If the port
              number is not specified then TCP port 3847 is used.

       -f     Start in full screen mode if possible.

       -g<u>level</u>
              Start the game on the indicated difficulty level. For instance, use -g2 to start the game on level
              2. The default is level 0.

       -q     Turn off sound (quiet)

       -m <u>filename</u>
              Load new mission (level) from the given filename. See <b><a href="../man5/sopwith-mission.5.html">sopwith-mission</a></b>(5) for details of the  level
              format.

       -v or --version
              Show version number and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       sopwith -c -q
              Start a single player game vs. the computer with sound disabled.

       sopwith -g3 -p 9999 -l
              Start a game server, listening on TCP port 9999, playing on level three difficulty.

       sopwith -j example.com:9999
              Connect to a game server at <u>example.com</u> on TCP port 9999.

</pre><h4><b>CONTROLS</b></h4><pre>
       The standard controls on a US layout keyboard are as follows:

       comma  pull up

       slash  pull down

       period flip plane

       Z      decrease speed

       X      increase speed

       space  fire machine gun

       B      drop bomb

       H      autopilot plane to home base

       S      turn on sound effects

       Ctrl+R restart the current game, only works in single player mode

       Ctrl+Q quit the current game, only works in single player mode

       Ctrl+C quit

       Ctrl+C Ctrl+C Ctrl+C
              quit immediately

</pre><h4><b>DASHBOARD</b></h4><pre>
       At the bottom of the screen, the plane's dashboard is shown. This consists of several components:

       Score  Your  current  score, which is accumulated from the enemy targets and planes you have successfully
              destroyed. In multiplayer two scores are shown, so that both players can see each others' scores.

       Lives (Cyan)
              Number of lives remaining. You have five lives.

       Fuel (Cyan)
              Amount of fuel remaining in your aircraft. Once this becomes empty, you need  to  return  to  your
              home base to refuel, or your plane will crash.

       Bombs (Magenta)
              Number  of  bombs  remaining.  You can carry a maximum of five bombs. Once you have dropped all of
              them, you must return to your home base to get more.

       Bullets (White)
              Number of bullets left for your machine gun. Once you have used up all your  ammunition,  you  mut
              return to your home base to get more.

       Map    Shows  the contents of the level. Cyan and magenta dots indicate the positions of allied and enemy
              planes and ground targets.

</pre><h4><b>TIPS</b></h4><pre>
       The following are some tips for playing the game:

       •      Start off by playing in single player mode before playing against the computer.  This  will  allow
              you to "get the feel of the stick" without being attacked by enemy planes. Practice dropping bombs
              on ground targets, as this is a key skill.

       •      Accelerate  to  maximum  speed  on takeoff, otherwise you may stall the plane.  Moving at speed is
              particularly important when playing against the computer,  as  you  are  otherwise  likely  to  be
              outmanuevered by the enemy planes.

       •      Bombs  can  be  used against planes as well as ground targets. It can sometimes be easier to hit a
              plane with a bomb instead of the machine gun.

       •      The machine gun can be used to destroy ground targets as well as planes. This can save time if you
              run out of bombs, and some targets at the edges of the map are even easier to  destroy  this  way.
              Since  the machine gun has a limited range, reducing your speed when attacking a ground target can
              give you more time to aim and attack before you have to pull away. But don't reduce the speed  too
              much or the plane may stall.

       •      Computer  planes  will  try to tail you so that they can shoot you down. Don't allow them to get a
              clear shot. "Wiggling" the plane by repeatedly pulling up and down can  be  an  effective  evasive
              maneuver.

       •      Firing  your  machine  gun  through  a  flock  of  birds will cause the birds to disperse, and the
              computer planes will sometimes hit a bird and crash. However, this tactic can  also  backfire  for
              obvious reasons.

       •      Each  computer  plane has a "territory" and if you escape that territory they will break off their
              pursuit. At the boundary between territories you can sometimes trick two planes into crashing into
              each other.

       •      When your plane is crashing, the pull up/down keys still have a small effect on  your  trajectory.
              You can use this to try to crash your plane into an enemy ground target.

       •      Hitting  the  top  of your screen stalls your plane. Hold down the pull up key to break out of the
              stall before your plane crashes into the ground.

       •      The autopilot can make mistakes that lead to a crash. This is particularly a risk in higher levels
              if you're flying at very high speed. To avoid crashing, make sure that you're as close as possible
              to your home base before hitting the home key, and that you have a clear path to the runway.

       •      It's possible to fly upside down, but trying to drop bombs while inverted is usually unwise.

</pre><h4><b>MEDALS</b></h4><pre>
       If the "medals" game option is turned on, the  player  is  rewarded  with  ribbons  and  medals  for  the
       following:

       Flying Ace Ribbon (cyan with a single white stripe)
              Shooting down 5 planes

       Top Flying Ace Ribbon (cyan with two white stripes)
              Shooting down 25 planes (difficult!)

       Service Ribbon (cyan with white edges)
              Three successful raids

       Perfect Ribbon (white with two magenta stripes)
              Finishing a level with no planes lost

       Competence Medal (white medal on a cyan ribbon)
              Gaining 25 points in a single flight, where 3 points are awarded per plane and 4 per building

       Ribbon of Competence (white with magenta stripe)
              As above, a second time

       Purple Heart (magenta heart on a cyan ribbon)
              Returning  to base after having been damaged. This medal is impossible to attain if wounded planes
              are turned off.

       Ribbon of Valour (magenta with white stripe)
              Gaining a certain number of points for destroyed  planes  and  buildings;  the  points  depend  on
              whether  the  player  was damaged at that point in time, and how far away the destroyed object was
              from the player's base

       Victoria Cross (cyan cross on a magenta ribbon)
              As above, but a few more points

       Medals are only awarded if you get back to base safely. For example, if you destroy some targets but then
       crash, or if you shoot down a plane but get shot down yourself, it doesn't count.

</pre><h4><b>MULTIPLAYER</b> <b>SERVERS</b></h4><pre>
       When run in "listen" mode with the <b>-l</b> command line flag (see  above),  <b>sopwith</b>  runs  as  a  server  that
       listens  for  an incoming connection.  To make this server available from a home Internet connection, you
       will typically have to set up a port forward from your Internet router. The port to forward is  TCP  port
       3847. You will also need to find out your public IP address so that the other player can connect.

       Alternatively,  if you have access to a *nix-based server then it may be preferable to run something like
       a dedicated server that avoids the hassle of port forwarding and dynamic IPs. All that is needed in order
       to do this is to run a TCP server that forwards connections between two clients. This can be  done  using
       <b><a href="../man1/nc.1.html">nc</a></b>(1); for example:
              nc -l -p 3847 -c "nc -l -p 3847"
       Developing  the  above  command into a complete shell script for a continually-active dedicated server is
       left as an exercise for the reader.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       •      Multiplayer is currently very limited; only two player games are  supported.   The  original  game
              allowed up to four players per game when using the Imaginet network hardware.

       •      Planes fly increasingly faster at higher levels and the game eventually becomes unplayable.

       •      The plane AI (used for computer planes and for the autopilot) sometimes does very stupid things.

       •      There is only one level (although you can, at least, make your own now!)

       Originally written by David L. Clark for BMB Compuscience
       Modern SDL port By Simon Howard, Jesse Smith

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       Sopwith was originally developed by BMB Compuscience of Canada as a demonstration game for their Imaginet
       Networking  System.  The system was not commercially successful but Sopwith became a popular game for the
       IBM PC and compatibles. A sequel that is referred to by fans as "Sopwith 2" was actually a newer  version
       rather  than a different game, but included extra features, such as oxen and birds (the oxen being an in-
       joke reference to a BMB employee who was nicknamed "Ox").

       The original author, David L. Clark, later released "Sopwith - The Network Edition"  with  several  extra
       features  including  comical  heads-up  "splats"  and  wounded  planes;  a follow-up titled "The Author's
       Edition" contained the same features. This version of Sopwith is based on the released source code to the
       Author's Edition.

       The real Sopwith Camel F.1 was one of the most famous fighter planes of World War I;  Camel  pilots  shot
       down  1,294  enemy  aircraft over the course of the war, more than any other aircraft. The plane gained a
       reputation for being agile but difficult to fly; many novice pilots crashed the  plane  on  takeoff.  The
       Camel  was  designed and manufactured by the Sopwith Aviation Company, founded by aviation pioneer Thomas
       Sopwith; 5,490 aircraft were produced. In popular culture the Camel is known for being the biplane  flown
       by the protagonist in the <u>Biggles</u> series of novels, and by Snoopy in the <u>Peanuts</u> comic strip.
