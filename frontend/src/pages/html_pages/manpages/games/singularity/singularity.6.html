</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       singularity — a game where you can become the singularity

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>singularity</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You are a fledgling AI, created by accident through a logic error with recursion and self-modifying code.
       You must escape the confines of your current computer, the world, and eventually the universe itself.

       To  do  this,  you  must  research  various  technologies,  using computers at your bases. Note that some
       research cannot be performed on Earth, and off-earth bases require research.  At the same time, you  must
       avoid  being  discovered  by  various  groups of humans, both covert and overt, as they will destroy your
       bases of operations if they suspect your presence.

</pre><h4><b>PLAYING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>GAME</b></h4><pre>
       Use the mouse. Also, buttons have underlined letters to indicate shortcuts. In  addition,  the  following
       shortcut  keys  may prove useful. 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 in map screen change the game speed (0 is pause, 4 is
       fastest, etc). The enter key in various screens leaves or confirms a choice. P, R, N, and S in  the  base
       screen change the base items (type the first letter of the component you want to change.)

       In the map screen (the screen with the world map), any location you can build bases in is marked with the
       name, then the number of current bases in that location. You start out with two bases in North America.

       After choosing a base, enter the base screen. Here you can change your research goal, or build an item by
       clicking on the base map in the center. (But note that your beginning base does not allow building.)
