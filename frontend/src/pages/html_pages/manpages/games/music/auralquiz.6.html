       auralquiz - simple music quiz game using your own music files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>auralquiz</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Auralquiz  is a music quiz game that scans a user's selected folder of music and creates a quiz using the
       tags from the audio files.  A sample of a random song is played and the player  must  answer  a  question
       about  the  sample  from  either  multiple  choice buttons or for hardcore difficulty, typing the correct
       answer.

       Up to 8 players can play in a turn based mode with scoring based on points;  more  points  are  given  by
       answering the question faster.
