</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       doomsday - Enhanced source port of Doom, Heretic and Hexen

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>doomsday</b> [<b>-iwad</b> <u>dir</u>] [<b>-game</b> <u>id</u>] [<b>-wnd</b>] [<b>-wh</b> <u>w</u> <u>h</u>] [<b>-file</b> <u>file</u> <u>...</u>]

       Everything following <b>--</b> is ignored.  <b>@</b> can be used to specify a response file whose contents are added to
       the command line.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
             <b>-file</b> | <b>-f</b>      Specify  one  or  more  data  files  or  packages (.pack, PK3, WAD, LMP) to load at
                             startup. When used together with the <b>-game</b> option,  the  specified  files  will  be
                             loaded  at  startup. Without <b>-game</b> they are just registered as available files that
                             can then be loaded in games. It is also possible to load data files at  runtime  by
                             opening the Packages sidebar (see TASK BAR) or with the <b>load</b> console command.

             <b>-game</b> | <b>-g</b>      Sets  the  game  to  load  after startup. If omitted, the Home screen will be shown
                             after startup. See GAMES  for  a  list  of  available  games.  For  example:  <b>-game</b>
                             <b>doom1-ultimate</b>

             <b>-h</b> | <b>-?</b> | <b>--help</b>
                             Prints a brief list of the command line options.

             <b>-iwad</b>           Specifies  a  directory  where  to look for IWAD files. Searches for IWADs from all
                             known games and automatically loads them when needed.

             <b>-version</b>        Show version information.

             <b>-wnd</b> | <b>-window</b>  Starts in windowed mode. The default is to start in fullscreen mode.

             <b>-wh</b>             Sets the size of the Doomsday window. In fullscreen mode  specifies  which  display
                             resolution to use.

   <b>Additional</b> <b>Options</b>
             <b>-center</b>         Center the window (when not in fullscreen mode).

             <b>-command</b> | <b>-cmd</b>
                             Execute  a console command during startup. Multiple commands can be joined together
                             with semicolons. Note that console variables have game plugin specific  values,  so
                             if  you  change  cvar values using this option without loading a game (with -game),
                             your values will be overwritten when a game plugin is loaded.

             <b>-connect</b>        Attempts to connect to the server running at the given network address.  Equivalent
                             to the console command connect.

             <b>-devlog</b> | <b>-nodevlog</b>
                             Enables  or  disables  developer log entries. These are useful for debugging and/or
                             troubleshooting, but are too verbose or technical for everyday use.

             <b>-dpi</b>            Set the UI pixel density. For example: <b>-dpi</b> <b>2.0</b>

             <b>-errors</b>         Set the name of the error output file. The file is written to the  runtime  folder.
                             This  output  file  is  created in addition to the usual doomsday.out. For example:
                             <b>-errors</b> <b>errors.out</b>

             <b>-fullscreen</b> | <b>-nofullscreen</b>
                             Enable or disable fullscreen mode.

             <b>-icd</b> | <b>-imusic</b> | <b>-isfx</b>
                             Set the audio plugin for CD playback,  music,  and  sound  effects.  The  following
                             plugins are available:
                                   <b>-</b>   dummy
                                   <b>-</b>   fmod
                                   <b>-</b>   fluidsynth
                                   <b>-</b>   sdlmixer
                                   <b>-</b>   openal

             <b>-fontsize</b>       Set  a  scaling factor for UI fonts. This is applied separately from the overall UI
                             scale setting (see CONFIGURATION). For example: <b>-fontsize</b> <b>1.5</b>

             <b>-loglevel</b>       Set the log output  level.  The  levels  are:  XVerbose,  Verbose,  Message,  Note,
                             Warning, Error, Critical.

             <b>-maximize</b> | <b>-nomaximize</b>
                             Maximize the window, or set the window to non-maximized mode.

             <b>-noaudio</b>        Disable all audio (sound effects and music).

             <b>-noautoselect</b>   Do  not  try  to automatically select a game to load. Only has effect when <b>-game</b> is
                             not used. Doomsday will always start in the Home screen or, when starting a server,
                             not at all.

             <b>-nodiscovery</b>    Disable discovery of servers on the local network.

             <b>-nofsaa</b>         Disable antialiasing.

             <b>-nogog</b>          Disable detection of games from GOG.

             <b>-nojoy</b>          Disable gamepads and other game controllers.

             <b>-nomouse</b>        Disable mouse input.

             <b>-nomusic</b>        Disable music.

             <b>-nosfx</b>          Disable sound effects.

             <b>-nosteam</b>        Disable detection of games from Steam.

             <b>-novsync</b>        Disable vsync.

             <b>-out</b>            Set the name of the log output file. The file is  always  written  to  the  runtime
                             folder. This option overrides the default doomsday.out.

             <b>-parse</b> | <b>-p</b>     Load  and  execute  the  specified file that contains console commands. Behavior is
                             similar to <b>-command</b> with the exception that the commands are loaded from a file.

             <b>-packs</b>          Set additional folders where to find packages. Works similar to -iwad.

             <b>-pkg</b>            One or more identifiers of packages that are loaded when the <b>-game</b> option  is  used
                             to launch directly into a game.

             <b>-reset</b>          Reset the engine configuration to default values. In practice, this just erases the
                             contents of the persist.pack file that stores configuration variables and UI state.
                             The affected variables include, for example, game window size and position, and log
                             filter settings.

             <b>-verbose</b> | <b>-v</b>   Print verbose log messages. Specify more than once for extra verbosity.

             <b>-vvv</b>            Enables all log messages (normal and developer, all levels).

             <b>-warp</b>           When  starting  directly  into  a  game  using  -game, automatically also jump to a
                             specific map. The map can be specified either as the map number, a pair of  numbers
                             (episode and map), or the map identifier (e.g., "MAP12").

             <b>-width</b> | <b>-height</b>
                             Set the horizontal/vertical display resolution when in fullscreen mode.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Your  runtime files are by default stored in a folder called <u><a href="file:~/.doomsday/">~/.doomsday/</a></u>. The following noteworthy files
       and folders can be found inside:

             runtime/autoexec.cfg
                             Console commands to execute after loading the game with the <b>-game</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Doomsday Engine is a "source port" of id Software's Doom and  Raven  Software's  Heretic  and  Hexen,
       which  were  popular  PC  FPS games in the early-to-mid 1990s. Doomsday enhances these classic games with
       many features including 3D graphics, fully customizable controls and  client/server  multiplayer,  making
       them  more  accessible  to  modern  gamers. However, the feel of the original games has been kept intact,
       ensuring sublime nostalgia or an exciting introduction to the pioneering games of the genre.

       Doomsday and the associated ports of Doom, Heretic and Hexen have been in  development  since  1999;  the
       first  versions  were  released  in  late  1999  and early 2000. Several people have been involved in the
       project (see ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS).

   <b>Requirements</b>
             <b>•</b>   At least one WAD file from the original Doom, Heretic, Hexen, or other supported game

             <b>•</b>   GPU with OpenGL 3.3 hardware acceleration

</pre><h4><b>GAMES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Loading</b> <b>IWADs</b>
       Doomsday requires IWAD files (<a href="http://wiki.dengine.net/w/WAD">http://wiki.dengine.net/w/WAD</a>) to run games. You can use the following ways
       to let the engine know where your IWADs can be found:

             <b>•</b>   The first time you launch Doomsday and it doesn't find any IWADs, it will  show  a  tab  titled
                 "Data Files?" containing a single button. Clicking the button opens a file dialog where you can
                 pick a folder where your IWAD files are located.

             <b>•</b>   The directory <u>/usr/share/games/doom</u> is always checked for any recognized IWAD files.

             <b>•</b>   Using the <b>-iwad</b> command-line option. You can either provide the path to the IWAD to use, or the
                 path  of  the directory under which IWADs are located. Doomsday will look through the specified
                 location and use all the recognized IWADs automatically. In other words, you can have the IWADs
                 for all games stored in a single directory; Doomsday will use  the  appropriate  one  for  each
                 launched game.

                 <b>-iwad</b> will also accept multiple paths as parameters:

                       <b>-iwad</b> <b>path1</b> <b>path2</b>

             <b>•</b>   The configuration file <u><a href="file:~/.doomsday/paths">~/.doomsday/paths</a></u> is checked for iwaddir (see FILES).

             <b>•</b>   Environment variables DOOMWADDIR and DOOMWADPATH (see ENVIRONMENT).

             <b>•</b>   The  configuration  variable Config.resource.packageFolder. This is typically set automatically
                 via the user interface, for instance when you first start  Doomsday.  Its  value  can  also  be
                 manipulated     in     the     Doomsday     Script     command     prompt.     (The    variable
                 Config.resource.recursedFolders determines if subdirectories should be searched.)

       Doomsday tries to recognize IWAD files based on their contents. The identification criteria can be viewed
       in                              GitHub                              (https://github.com/skyjake/Doomsday-
       Engine/blob/master/doomsday/apps/libdoomsday/net.dengine.base.pack/databundles.dei).

   <b>Supported</b> <b>Games</b>
       One  game  plugin,  such  as  the  Doom  Plugin, is able to run many different variants of the game. Each
       variant emulates a specific version of the original game and typically has its own IWAD file.

       Below is a list of all the games supported by the game plugins distributed with Doomsday.

</pre><h4><b>HOME</b> <b>SCREEN</b></h4><pre>
       The Home screen in Doomsday 2 is a full replacement for the separate front-end application that was  used
       in earlier versions. In Home you can manage your game library, resource packs and other add-ons, and join
       multiplayer games.

       Home consists of a number of scrollable tabs. There are several ways to navigate between tabs:

             <b>-</b>   Click on the tab names in the top of the screen.
             <b>-</b>   Left and right arrow keys move focus to an adjacent tab.
             <b>-</b>   Shortcut keys: D, H, X, O, M, and S (while not entering text in a text field.)
             <b>-</b>   Click on the left or right edge of the screen.

   <b>Game</b> <b>Library</b>
       The  game  library  lists  all  the  available  games  and  their associated save files. Each game can be
       configured to load additional mods (WADs, PK3s, data  files,  resource  packs).  You  can  also  add  new
       customized games based on one of the built-in games.

       In  User  Interface  settings  you  can  hide entire game tabs, if you are not interested in a particular
       family of games. See CONFIGURATION for more details.

       <b>Sorting</b> <b>games</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>library.</b> If you have lots of games available, it may be helpful to change  the  game
       library  view options so you can more easily find the game you are looking for. Click on the "..." button
       under the tab title to see the view options.

       <b>Starting</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>with</b> <b>or</b> <b>without</b> <b>additional</b> <b>mods.</b> Click on a game to select it, or move the selection with
       the arrow keys. When selected, Mods and Play buttons slide in. The Mods button shows  a  number  for  how
       many  additional  mods  have  been selected for loading. Click Play or double-click the game to start the
       game.

       <b>Selecting</b> <b>mods.</b> Click the game's Mods button to choose which additional mods are going to be loaded  when
       the game is started. On the left side of the dialog, you have a list of the mods selected for loading. On
       the  right,  you  can browse the available mods. The mods browser works similarly to the Mods tab, and it
       has a search field and Info buttons (see MODS). To add a mod to  the  game,  click  the  Plus  button  or
       double-click the mod.

       <b>Loading</b>  <b>a</b> <b>saved</b> <b>game.</b> All saved games are listed below the game they were created in. Click on a save to
       select it, and then press the game's Play button. Clicking on an already selected save will unselect it.

       <b>NOTE:</b>   Old savegames created with Doomsday 1.x do not contain information about  which  data  files  and
               mods  were  in  use when the save was created, so Doomsday can't determine which game they belong
               to. Such saves are listed under each variant of the game.

       <b>Savegame</b> <b>information.</b> Right-click on a saved game to see information about the save: which data files and
       mods were in use, the overall game parameteres, current map, and other status information.

       <b>Deleting</b> <b>a</b> <b>saved</b> <b>game.</b> When a savegame is selected, a small X button appears next to it. Clicking  the  X
       lets you delete the save.

       <b>Save</b>  <b>folders.</b>  Each game is assigned a unique save folder where all the save files of the game are kept.
       Right-click on a profile and select "Show Save Folder" to  open  the  folder  in  operating  system  file
       browser.  Note  that custom games created in version 2.0 or earlier share a save folder with the built-in
       game. You can use the "Create New Save Folder" menu item to create a new save folder for the custom game,
       but you will need to manually move the existing save files over there.

       <b>Creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>custom</b> <b>game.</b> At the bottom of each game tab, there  is  a  Plus  button  that  creates  a  new
       customized  game.  In  the game settings, you can choose which game mode will be used, and which mods are
       selected for loading. Note that game cannot have a name that is identical to an already existing game  in
       the library.

       <b>Duplicate,</b>  <b>edit,</b>  <b>and</b>  <b>delete</b>  <b>games.</b>  Any  game can be duplicated by right-clicking on it and selecting
       "Duplicate". Games can also be edited to change their name, the primary data file (IWAD), and the set  of
       selected mods.

   <b>Mods</b>
       The  Mods  tab  is  used to browse the available mods and other packages. The Mods tab shows all the data
       files that Doomsday knows about. You can also quickly try out individual mods in one your games.

       <b>Configuring</b> <b>the</b> <b>mod</b> <b>search</b> <b>folders.</b> To let Doomsday know where your mods  can  be  found,  either  select
       "Settings"  in  the  Mods  tab's actions menu (the "..." button under the tab title), or go to Data Files
       settings (see CONFIGURATION). The mods will not be copied or moved from wherever you keep them.

       <b>Browsing</b> <b>mods.</b> The mods list may contains hundreds of items, so you may want  to  find  the  mods  you're
       looking  for  by entering some search terms. Enter the words to search for in the search field at the top
       of the list. The search is limited to metadata; the actual file contents are not accessed. When  entering
       multiple words, only mods whose metadata contains all the words are shown.

       <b>Special</b> <b>search</b> <b>keywords.</b> Some search words have a special meaning:

             <b>•</b>   "gamedata": Primary game data files (IWADs).

             <b>•</b>   "hidden":  Only  mods  that  are normally hidden will be shown. Mods that are hidden by default
                 include, for example, mods inside other packages that will get automatically loaded.

             <b>•</b>   "loaded": Only show currently loaded mods. This is useful when browsing mods  while  playing  a
                 game.

             <b>•</b>   "core": Doomsday's own core packages. These will be automatically loaded as needed.

       <b>Viewing</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>mod.</b> Right-click a mod or click on the "..." button to view information about
       it.  In  the case of WAD files, all the maps in the WAD are listed so you'll know which map to start when
       playing. The info popup also shows the game title picture found in the mod, and readme notes provided  by
       the  author.  In  some  cases,  Doomsday can make a guess about the game that the mod is meant to be used
       with.

       <b>Quickly</b> <b>trying</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>mod.</b> One of the most useful features of the Mods tab is quickly loading a mod in one
       your games. This will make no changes to your  existing  games.  Simply  open  the  mod  info  popup  (as
       explained  above)  and  click  on  "Play in...". However, you should first check that the mod actually is
       compatible with the game you are playing. Also be aware that if you are already running a game,  it  will
       be unloaded first and any unsaved progress will be lost.

       <b>Quickly</b>  <b>adding</b>  <b>a</b> <b>mod</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>game.</b> The "Add to..." button in the mod info popup will add the mod to one of
       your existing games. The games that already have the mod are tagged "ADDED" in the list.

       <b>Configuring</b> <b>optional</b> <b>contents.</b> Some mods have optional subcomponents. For instance, add-ons that use  the
       Snowberry  Box  format may include both opt-in and opt-out mods. When viewing information about this kind
       of collections, an additional "Options" button is shown in the mod info popup. This will let  you  enable
       or disable individual contained mods.

   <b>Multiplayer</b>
       The  Multiplayer  tab  lists  multiplayer  games  that  you  can  join.  Servers on the local network are
       discovered automatically and are visible immediately in  the  Multiplayer  games  list.  The  dengine.net
       (<a href="http://dengine.net/">http://dengine.net/</a>) master server is also automatically queried for any public servers.

       <b>Viewing</b> <b>server</b> <b>information.</b> Right-click a server in the list to view information about it. The same popup
       can  be  opened  by  clicking  the  small  "..." button in the server description. The status information
       includes:
             <b>-</b>   ping time
             <b>-</b>   which game and map is currently running
             <b>-</b>   outline of the current map
             <b>-</b>   list of mods loaded on the server
             <b>-</b>   list of connected players
             <b>-</b>   server version

       <b>Joining</b> <b>a</b> <b>game.</b> Join an open multiplayer game by clicking "Join" either in the  server  list  or  in  the
       server information popup. Any missing mods are downloaded automatically after you click the button.

       <b>Player</b>  <b>name</b>  <b>and</b>  <b>color.</b>  When  a  game  is running (after joining a multiplayer game or also in single-
       player), go to the game's "Options" menu and select "Player Setup". In this  menu  you  can  change  your
       multiplayer  name,  player  color, and (in Hexen) player class. Note that this is the game's own menu and
       not part of Doomsday's UI.

       <b>Connecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-public</b> <b>server.</b> To connect to a server that is not announced  to  the  master  server,
       select  "Connect  to  Server..."  in  the Multiplayer tab's actions menu ("..." under the tab title), and
       enter the server's IP address or domain name.

       <b>Failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>connect?</b> Connectivity problems can also be due to your firewall or network address translation
       (NAT) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation). Doomsday uses TCP network  connections
       for multiplayer games. If you host a game and are behind a firewall or using NAT, you must make sure that
       other  computers  are able to open TCP connections to your computer. This entails opening the appropriate
       incoming TCP ports on your firewall and/or configuring the NAT so that the correct ports  are  routed  to
       your computer.

       Additionally,  UDP  ports 13209-13224 are used for detecting servers running on the local network; if you
       are experiencing problems with autodetecting local servers, check that your firewall isn't blocking these
       UDP ports on either end.

       A server opens one TCP port for listening to incoming connections. The port must be open for incoming TCP
       traffic in the firewall. The port number is configured with the console variable net-ip-port. By default,
       a server uses TCP port 13209.

       Clients do not require any firewall configuration for incoming connections. A client  only  needs  to  be
       able to reach the server via the server's TCP port.

       You can see status information about the network subsystem with the console command:

             net info

       <b>Hosting</b>  <b>a</b>  <b>game.</b>  Use  <b>doomsday-shell</b> or <b>doomsday-shell-text</b> to host a multiplayer game of your own. The
       Shell allows you to start, stop, and control Doomsday multiplayer servers. This includes  both  your  own
       local servers and remote servers on the internet.

       <u>doomsday-server</u>  runs  in  a  background process and has no UI of its own. The Shell provides a couple of
       basic game options that you can change via the GUI. For example, you can choose between  Deatchmatch  and
       Co-op mode, change the current map, and enable or disable monsters. The full set of console variables can
       be modified via the Console tab (text-mode command line interface).

       If  your server is not public (i.e., announced to the master server), a client can connect to it manually
       using the IP address or domain name.

       For more information about the Shell, see Shell Help in the wiki (https://manual.dengine.net/Shell_Help).

</pre><h4><b>TASK</b> <b>BAR</b></h4><pre>
       The task bar is a central element of Doomsday's UI. It is available at all times and provides  access  to
       key features of the engine. For example, you can modify configuration settings, show the Home screen, and
       unload the current game.

       You can show the task bar by pressing Shift + Esc.

   <b>App</b> <b>Menu</b>
       The rightmost button in the task bar (with the DE logo) opens the Doomsday app menu.

       <b>Tutorial.</b>  The  first-run tutorial points out the basic features of Doomsday's UI. It is only shown once,
       but you can manually show it again by selecting "Help: Show Tutorial".

       <b>Browsing</b> <b>and</b> <b>loading</b> <b>mods.</b> "Browse Mods..." opens the mod browser in a sidebar where mods can  be  loaded
       and  unloaded  manually. You can also view information about mods like in the Home screen. The sidebar is
       only available when a game is loaded. You can use the "loaded" keyword to filter the list  so  that  only
       the currently loaded mods are listed.

       <b>NOTE:</b>   Data  from  newly  loaded  mods  may  not  be used until a new map is started in the game. Use of
               external textures can be enabled and disabled in Renderer settings.

       <b>Checking</b> <b>for</b> <b>updates.</b> Doomsday queries the dengine.net website to see if there are newer builds and shows
       a notification when updates are available. You can always also do a  manual  update  check  by  selecting
       "Check for Updates".

       <b>Clearing</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>resource</b>  <b>cache.</b>  Some  resources  and  metadata  get cached for later access. This allows
       Doomsday to load the resources faster and operate more efficiently. Usually it is  unnecessary  to  clear
       the cache manually. See FILES for the cache's location.

   <b>Configuration</b>
       The  task  bar's  Gear  button  opens  the  configuration  menu. This is where the majority of Doomsday's
       settings can be viewed and changed. Some of the settings  are  only  available  when  a  game  is  loaded
       ("Input", for instance).

       <b>Reset</b>  <b>to</b>  <b>defaults</b>  <b>and</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>settings.</b> Many settings dialogs have a "Reset to Defaults" button. This
       affects only the settings in that one particular dialog. Sometimes a Gauge button is also  available.  It
       is reserved for advanced settings that are useful for developers and modding.

       <b>Renderer</b>  <b>settings.</b> Most of the renderer settings are managed via appearance profiles. This makes it easy
       to select one of the presets, such as a vanilla look or more exaggerated effects. The dialog has a couple
       of general settings in addition  to  the  active  appearance  profile.  The  "Pixel  Density"  slider  is
       particularly  useful  as  it allows improving rendering performance and achieving a more pixelated, 1990s
       VGA-style look. The selected appearance profile applies to all games.

       Some resource packs with high-resolution textures are intended to be used with  the  unmodified  original
       games.  However,  a  PWAD  file  may replace some of the textures with custom ones. The "External Images"
       options allow you to control when external images are actually enabled  if  the  resource  packs  in  use
       aren't compatible with the loaded PWADs.

       <b>Renderer</b>  <b>appearance</b>  <b>sidebar.</b> Click the Gear button next to the selected renderer appearance profile and
       select "Edit" or "View" to open the appearance sidebar. Alternatively you can open the sidebar  with  the
       <b>rendedit</b>  console command. Individual settings groups can be folded and unfolded by clicking on the group
       titles. You can continue playing the game while the sidebar is visible. When  you're  done,  dismiss  the
       sidebar with the X button in the top right corner.

       <b>Video</b>  <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios.</b> In addition to basic game window parameters, the Video settings dialog has a set of
       aspect ratio options. These control the aspect ratios applied to specific elements in the game:

             <b>-</b>   "Original 1:1": The aspect ratio is exactly as in the original game.
             <b>-</b>   "Smart": The aspect ratio is dynamic but does not stretch too far away from the 1:1 ratio.
             <b>-</b>   "Stretched": The aspect ratio is unrestricted and adapts to window  dimensions.  Game  elements
                 may appear too wide or tall with this setting.

       <b>Audio</b>  <b>backend.</b>  Audio  output capabilities vary based on operating system and audio hardware. Doomsday's
       audio backend can be configured according to your needs primarily via the selection  of  audio  interface
       plugins.  The recommendation on all platforms is FMOD for sound effects and FluidSynth for music, because
       these two enable software-based rendering of both 3D sound effects and MIDI  music.  Some  of  the  audio
       options  are  dependent  on  the active audio plugins. For example, a MIDI sound font is supported by the
       FMOD and FluidSynth plugins. 3D sound and reverb are supported by  FMOD,  OpenAL,  and  DirectSound.  The
       audio backend can be reconfigured on the fly; any changes are applied when you press the "Apply" button.

       <b>Game</b>  <b>controllers.</b>  Doomsday  comes  with a few preset bindings for different gamepads. To use one of the
       presets, click on the "Game Controller Preset" button and select a suitable one. Then  click  "Apply"  to
       erase  all  your  existing  game  controller  bindings and activate the ones in the preset. You can still
       manually edit the bindings in the game's "Options" menu.

       <b>Mouse</b> <b>input</b> <b>settings.</b> The "Sync Axis Sensitivities" option will ensure that mouse sensitivity is the same
       in both the horizontal and vertical directions.

       <b>Minimizing</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>latency.</b> The default input settings try to replicate the feel  of  the  original  35  Hz
       input  events  of  Doom.  However,  when the screen is actually refreshed at a higher rate, this may feel
       distractingly laggy. The 35 Hz limiter can be disabled in the advanced input settings  (click  the  Gauge
       button). This will minimize mouse input latency as much as possible. You may additionally want to disable
       mouse filtering by toggling the "Filter X Axis" and "Filter Y Axis" options.

       <b>Local</b>  <b>multiplayer</b>  <b>mods.</b> By default, clients are not allowed to load mods in addition to what the server
       is using. This avoids any potential compatibility issues with the client's mods overriding  some  of  the
       game's  definitions. However, you can manually enable local mods in Network settings. You can then select
       additional local mods for multiplayer games in the server information popup before joining the game.

       <b>User</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>settings.</b> The "Scale" setting applies to the Doomsday UI only,  and  adjusts  the  overall
       size  of  UI elements and fonts. Lowering the UI scaling may be helpful for example when using a very low
       display resolution. In the Home screen there will be more tabs visible at the  same  time  when  using  a
       smaller UI scale.

       <b>Updater</b>  <b>settings.</b> The Updater settings determine when Doomsday will check for available updates. When an
       update is downloaded, it is saved to your temporary files folder.

   <b>Log</b> <b>History</b> <b>and</b> <b>Log</b> <b>Options</b> <b>Menu</b>
       The log message history panel slides in from the left edge of the view. When visible, you  can  drag  its
       right edge to resize it.

       The leftmost button in the task bar opens the log options menu:

             Show Full Log   Expands the log history panel to its full size. When the task bar is open, pressing
                             PageUp will also expand the panel size.

             Close Log       Dismisses the log history panel.

             Go to Latest    Scrolls the log history to the latest message.

             Copy Path to Clipboard
                             Copies the doomsday.out file path to the system clipboard to make it easier to find
                             the output file.

             Clear Log       Deletes all log messages from memory. The doomsday.out file is unaffected.

                             When  this  setting  is  enabled,  new  log entries will cause the history panel to
                             scroll to the latest entry (bottom of the list).

             Entry Metadata  When this setting is enabled, log entries will be prefixed  with  a  timestamp  and
                             categorization symbols.

             Log Filter &amp; Alerts
                             Settings  for  filtering  which  log messages get printed. You can choose filtering
                             options individually for each engine  subsystem.  Developer  messages  ("Dev")  are
                             primarily  intended  for developers and debugging, so they are disabled by default.
                             The "Alert" toggles cause warnings and errors to pop up in the notification area.

   <b>Command</b> <b>Prompt</b>
       The middle of the task bar is occupied by a command  prompt  text  field.  Here  you  can  enter  console
       commands  and  modify  console variables manually. This is typically most useful for developers, modders,
       and other advanced users.

       <b>Console</b> <b>basics.</b> Type <b>help</b> to get started. This prints  some  basic  information  about  how  to  use  the
       console,    and   commands   for   listing   all   the   available   console   commands   and   variables
       (https://manual.dengine.net/consolevariable). At any time, press  Tab  to  autocomplete  the  word  being
       typed.  This  will  pop  up  a  list  of  all  possible completions, including the current values for any
       variables. You can change console variable values as follows:

             <b>rend-camera-fov</b> <b>110</b>

       <b>Shortcut</b> <b>key.</b> You should set up a console shortcut key if you find yourself going to the  console  often.
       The  shortcut  defaults to Tilde (U.S. keyboard) but you can choose your own shortcut key by clicking the
       "&gt;" button next to the command prompt.

       <b>Interactive</b> <b>Doomsday</b> <b>Script</b>  <b>prompt.</b>  Doomsday  Script  is  a  fully-fledged  Python/Ruby-like  scripting
       language  built  into  Doomsday  2.  While it doesn't yet allow full access to all engine features, it is
       being improved in each release. The command prompt can be switched to  Doomsday  Script  mode  by  right-
       clicking  the  "&gt;" prompt menu button. Everything entered into the command prompt is then run as Doomsday
       Script. This mode is intended only for developers.
