</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       jester - an X-based game similar to <u>Othello</u>(tm)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jester</b> [{-display, -d, --display} <u>display</u>] [{-h, -help, --help}] [-2players] [-ai {white, black}]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jester</b>  is  an  X-based  game  similar  to  the  board game <u>Othello</u>.  <u>jester</u> allows you to waste hours of
       otherwise productive time that could be spent playing Solitaire instead.

</pre><h4><b>GAME</b> <b>PLAY</b></h4><pre>
       There are two players, one playing the white pieces, the other playing the  black  pieces.   Each  player
       takes  turns  placing  a  piece  of his or her color on an 8x8 board.  Each piece must be placed so as to
       bracket a line of the opponent's pieces between two of the current player's pieces.  When  this  happens,
       the opponent's pieces are replaced by pieces of the current player's color.

       When  the  cursor  is  over  a square that it is legal for the current player to play in, the cursor will
       change to a pointing hand.  A small rectangle in the upper right side of the window shows  the  color  of
       the current player.

       The  game ends when a player cannot make a move, either because the board is full or because the position
       of the pieces makes it impossible to make a move.  At this point, the player with the most pieces on  the
       board is the winner.  You will be offered the option of starting a new game.

       You may exit at any time by clicking the “Exit” button.
