</pre><h4><b>NAME</b> <b>crimson</b> <b>-</b> <b>a</b> <b>hex-based</b> <b>tactical</b> <b>combat</b> <b>game</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>crimson</b> [--level <u>level</u>] [--width <u>w</u>] [--height <u>h</u>] [--fullscreen 1|0] [--sound 1|0]

       <b>crimson</b> {--help | --version}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>

       Crimson Fields is a tactical war game in the tradition of the popular Battle Isle. Two players command a
       number of units on a map of hexagons, trying to accomplish mission objectives ranging from defending
       important locations to simply destroying all enemy forces. Damaged units may be repaired or replaced by
       new recruits, while victorious squadrons will improve their abilities so they will be even more difficult
       to beat next time.

       The game can be played against a human adversary in hot-seat mode, over a network, or via e-mail, or
       against a computer player.

       The level editor <b><a href="../man6/cfed.6.html">cfed</a></b>(6) can be used to create your own levels.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

       If called without options <b>crimson</b> will open its main window using the settings from the last session or
       the defaults if no previous settings exist.

       <b>--level</b> <u>level</u>
           Skip the level selection window and load the mission file <u>level</u>. The file may be either a standard
           level file or a saved game. When starting a new game this way you will be playing a single map
           against the computer without any handicaps.

       <b>--width</b> <u>w</u>
           Set screen width to <u>w</u>. Minimum screen width is 320. Default is 800.

       <b>--height</b> <u>h</u>
           Set screen height to <u>h</u>. Minimum screen height is 240. Default is 600.

       <b>--fullscreen</b> 1|0
           Turn fullscreen mode on/off. The default is to start in windowed mode.

       <b>--sound</b> 1|0
           Turn sound on/off. The default is on.

       <b>--help</b>
           Print a usage message on standard output and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print version information on standard output and exit.

       The display and sound options given to <b>crimson</b> on startup will be saved to file and restored on the next
       program start.

</pre><h4><b>GETTING</b> <b>STARTED</b></h4><pre>

   <b>Introduction</b>

       The once peaceful planet Nexus has been invaded by beings calling themselves the Empire of Kand who are
       determined to conquer Nexus or destroy it completely. The public unrest has become violent as the people
       attempt revolution against the invasion, but the Empire of Kand are quick to silence opposition. Nexus is
       on the verge of war and its people have formed factions to battle the Empire. As a member of one of the
       major rebel factions, the Free Nexus Army, your goals are obvious: to drive the intruders back to
       whichever part of the galaxy they came from and restore peace on planet Nexus...

       (This is the background story for most of the included missions and the default campaign. There may be
       maps with entirely different settings.)

   <b>Main</b> <b>Menu</b>

       The main screen presents a number of widgets to configure the game. The most important decision is
       whether you want to play a skirmish match, a campaign, or load a saved game. Skirmishes are stand-alone
       maps while campaigns consist of a number of maps which must be played (and won) in sequence. Each map
       that you advance to during a campaign will also be unlocked for skirmish matches. While campaigns can
       only be played against the computer, skirmishes can additionally be played as hot-seat matches (two
       players on one computer taking turns), e-mail matches (see the section called “PLAY-BY-E-MAIL”), or over
       a network, and when playing against the computer you get to choose which side you want to play on. For
       both game types you can optionally define a handicap, to make the game a bit easier or harder. What this
       means exactly depends on the map being played but in most cases a handicapped player will have fewer
       units or resources at his disposal than his opponent.

       The large box on the left lists all available skirmishes, campaigns, or saved games, while the box on the
       right displays a small image of the selected map or, for campaigns, the story. For skirmishes, the number
       in brackets shows the recommended number of players. Missions designed for one player are often rather
       unbalanced if played against another human since the computer plays so different from a human, although a
       handicap can sometimes fix this.

       After you have selected a map hit Start to enter the game.

   <b>First</b> <b>Steps</b>

       After starting the match you will be presented with the mission briefing. Here you are given your orders
       and objectives to win the map. As both players usually have different and conflicting goals, each player
       gets his own briefing session at the beginning of his first turn.

       After the briefing you will be presented with the map. This is your command center. From here you can
       issue most of the orders that will determine the outcome of the mission. The first player commands the
       yellow units while the second player or computer takes control of the blue units.

       The map consists of small regions of land (or water) each known as a <u>hex</u> (sometimes also called <u>field</u> or
       <u>square</u>). Left-clicking on a hex selects that hex and moves the cursor to it. If there is a unit on the
       selected hex then a small bar will appear in the lower left of the screen showing the rank of the unit,
       its type, and the squad size (see the section called “Experience” for more information about ranks). If
       there is instead a building or shop on the selected hex, the information bar displays the name of the
       shop and possibly some icons representing special attributes (see the section called “CRYSTALS” for
       details). Shops may occupy several fields, but they only have a single entrance, which is marked by the
       colour of the respective owner. Buildings with a white entrance are neutral and not controlled by any
       player.

       A right-click on one of your units generally brings up a context menu for that unit (this does not apply
       to enemy units). Here you can view the unit stats, or inspect its contents (transporters only). Other
       units like mine-sweepers may have special skills which also show up here. If the unit is not a
       transporter and does not offer any special skills, the menu is skipped and you are directly taken to the
       stats display.

       The stats window is basically divided in two parts. The top part shows the unit name and its values for
       speed, armour, and effectiveness against ground troops, aircraft, and ships in that order, from the top
       left to the bottom right. Most units have a weapon range of 1, meaning they can shoot at units one hex
       away (i.e. directly next to it). For units with different settings, the actual range is given in brackets
       after the weapon power. The second part of the window lists the most important terrain types. Shaded
       terrain indicates that the unit cannot cross that ground.

       Right-clicking anywhere but on a unit or pressing F1 pops up the Game menu where you can review your
       mission objectives, take a look at an overview map, or save your game, for example.

       You select one of your units by simply clicking on it. Large parts of the map will now be shaded to
       indicate that the unit cannot move there. Unshaded enemy units are potential targets. To move to an
       accessible field or attack a foe, simply double-click the respective hex. If you accidentally sent your
       unit to a hex you did not want it to go to, right-clicking on the unit gives you the option of reverting
       the last move, as long as it did not trigger any special events.

       If you click twice on one of your shops or a neutral one, you enter that building. Of course, you can
       also move units into shops, although only some units (<u>Infantry</u> in the default set) can move into shops
       not owned by you, and some buildings may not allow all unit types. Quite often buildings are important
       mission objectives. Taking the enemy headquarters, e.g., is a very common goal. But even if you do not
       specifically need to control a certain shop for victory, it can still be very helpful as it may be
       possible to repair or build units (see the section called “CRYSTALS”).

       When you have issued all orders, select End Turn from the Game menu. Your commands are then executed,
       fights are resolved, and your opponent gets his chance to strike back...

</pre><h4><b>MOVEMENT</b></h4><pre>

       Each unit may only move once each turn, and only if it did not initiate combat on the same turn.
       <u>Artillery</u> and <u>Anti-Aircraft</u> <u>Guns</u> cannot attack if they have already been moved on the same turn. To move
       around on the map, a unit needs movement points. The number in the upper left corner of the unit
       information dialog (which can be brought up for one of your units by right-clicking it) indicates how
       many hexes the unit can move under optimal circumstances. The actual range is determined by several
       factors.

       For ordinary ground units the terrain can greatly reduce the range of action. The maximum can only ever
       be reached on roads, everything else will slow the unit down, and mountains more so than forest. For
       airborne units or ships, terrain is of no importance.

       Enemy units can be trapped in order to prevent them from using superior speed or to deny them access to
       certain areas of the map. A unit which attempts to cross a hex between two hostile units or one hostile
       unit and inaccessible terrain will be stopped immediately after passing through.

       A unit cannot leave a transport or building and enter another one on the same turn. Enemy buildings can
       only be conquered by infantry units.

</pre><h4><b>COMBAT</b></h4><pre>

   <b>Results</b>

       Basically the probability to hit an enemy unit in combat is the same for all unit types, although the
       attacker always gets a slight advantage. This hit probability is then modified by effects such as
       experience, distance to the target, terrain, or wedging (see below). Similarly, each unit gets assigned a
       probability for evading an attack which is then modified by experience, terrain effects and blocking. If
       a unit scores a hit it will increase its attack pool by an amount equal to its strength. A unit which
       successfully evades an attack will have its defence pool grow by an amount equal to its defence or armour
       value. Finally, each attack pool is compared to the enemy´s defence pool, and the resulting ratio
       determines the casualties on both sides.

   <b>Terrain</b>

       Terrain is an important factor in combat as it can heavily influence a unit´s effectiveness. For example,
       fighting on a road or open plains will greatly increase attacking strength but offers relatively poor
       defensive capabilities, whereas a unit in the mountains will profit from the higher position in both
       attack and defence. Terrain modifiers do not apply for aircraft.

   <b>Wedging</b>

       Friendly units can help increase the combat strength of an attacking unit without attacking themselves.
       For each friendly unit which is adjacent to and capable of shooting at the defender, the attacker will
       get a 10 per cent bonus. If the unit is adjacent to the defender, but cannot attack it the bonus is
       reduced to 5 per cent. A friendly unit in the back of the defender will earn another 5 per cent bonus, or
       10 if it could also attack. It does not matter whether a wedging unit actually attacks the defender.
       Wedging does not work for long-range attacks.

   <b>Blocking</b>

       In a manner similar to wedging, defending units may improve their position in combat. For each friendly
       unit adjacent to the attacker and the defender, the defending unit will have its combat strength
       increased by 10 per cent. Just like wedging, blocking does not help against long-range attacks.

   <b>Experience</b>

       Veteran units are usually much stronger than newly assembled ones. If you manage to wipe out an enemy
       unit your unit will receive three experience points. If the enemy is only damaged you will still get one
       point. Every three experience points a unit advances to a new rank which improves its combat skills.
       Still, a seasoned infantry unit will have a very hard time against a group of recently recruited heavy
       tanks. Destroying mines does not earn any experience points.

</pre><h4><b>CRYSTALS</b></h4><pre>

       Crystals represent the resources required to maintain and enlarge your army. You need them to repair
       damaged units or build new ones.

   <b>Repairs</b>

       Units which have been damaged in combat can be repaired in any building equipped for this purpose (a
       workshop). To check whether a building is a workshop, click on it. For workshops a wrench icon will be
       displayed in the small info bar that appears in the lower left of the screen, and a repair button is
       available in the icon bar inside. Repairing will restore a unit to its full strength and requires an
       amount of 5 crystals, no matter what kind of unit it is or how badly is was damaged. Apart from the
       crystal cost the unit loses one experience point for each rookie that fills up an empty slot.

       The ability to repair damaged units is not necessarily limited to shops. Some unit types may offer the
       same service (from the standard unit set, for example, the <u>Aircraft</u> <u>Carriers</u> can bring aircraft back into
       shape). Repairs in units works exactly the same way as in workshops, and you also need to supply the
       crystals to do so.

   <b>Production</b>

       To build new units you need some crystals and a factory (hammer icon). The amount of crystals required
       depends on the type of unit you want to build: A squad of light reconnaissance vehicles is cheaper than a
       group of heavy attack choppers. Most factories can not produce all unit types, even if you could afford
       it. If you click on the production button inside a factory, you are shown the list of units which can be
       built in this particular factory. Next to each unit type is the amount of crystals that will be consumed.
       Newly built units can only move on your next turn.

   <b>Mines</b>

       To replenish your supply of crystals you need mines. Mines are buildings which ´produce´ a certain amount
       of crystals each turn. They can not be identified from the outside. Many maps do not have any mines at
       all, so it is always a good idea to consider carefully what you spend your resources on. Crystals can be
       transferred from one building to another (e.g. from a mine to a factory) using any transporter unit.

</pre><h4><b>PLAY-BY-E-MAIL</b></h4><pre>

       If Crimson Fields is played in play-by-e-mail mode, the game will automatically be saved whenever a
       player ends her turn. The resulting save file can then be sent to your opponent using your favourite mail
       client program.

       On your first turn you will be asked for a password. You will be prompted for this password at the
       beginning of each of your turns to prevent your opponent from spying. Note, however, that the password
       only offers very mild protection if you are playing against deliberate cheaters. Choose your enemies
       carefully!
