</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gtk3-nocsd - transparently disable Gtk+3 client side decorations (CSD)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gtk3-nocsd</b> <u>command</u> [ <u>command</u> <u>arguments</u> ... ]

       <b>symlinked-command</b>
              [ <u>command</u> <u>arguments</u> ... ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gtk3-nocsd</b>  runs  a command in the environment where Gtk+3 client side decorations (CSD) are disabled, by
       using LD_PRELOAD to load the library <b>libgtk3-nocsd.so.0</b> that overrides some GLib, GDK and Gtk  API  calls
       with customized variants.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>command</u>
              The  command  to execute. It may be either a full path or the name of the command in PATH. In case
              command cannot be found in PATH, <b>gtk3-nocsd</b> will fail.

       <u>command</u> <u>arguments</u>
              Arbitrary number of arguments to pass to the command being executed.

</pre><h4><b>INTEGRATION</b> <b>IN</b> <b>DEBIAN</b></h4><pre>
       Usage of <b>gtk3-nocsd</b> is not required in Debian by default, because gtk3-nocsd functionality  is  activated
       automatically  on Xsession startup if anything but GNOME is used. On GNOME CSDs will remain enabled. Both
       the administrator and each individual user may override those defaults.

       Administrators   may   choose    to    re-enable    CSDs    by    default    by    editing    the    file
       <u>/etc/X11/Xsession.d/01gtk3-nocsd</u> and changing the following setting:

              export GTK_CSD=1

       Users  may  choose to override this (in either way) by adding a similar line to their <u><a href="file:~/.xsessionrc">~/.xsessionrc</a></u>.  For
       more details, please see <u>/usr/share/doc/gtk3-nocsd/README.Debian</u>.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b> <b>VIA</b> <b>SYMLINKS</b></h4><pre>
       If a symlink to <b>gtk3-nocsd</b> under a different name is called, <b>gtk3-nocsd</b> will assume that the name it  was
       called  under is the name of the command that is supposed to be executed. It will look for the command in
       the PATH environment variable, excluding itself, and execute it with  the  proper  environment  variables
       set. This is useful when is not desirable to add gtk3-nocsd to the system-wide LD_PRELOAD or if it should
       be applied only to certain applications.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       When  using  <b>gtk3-nocsd</b>  with  <b>setarch</b>  (including  alias  such  as <b>linux32</b>), or anyway with chroots with
       different architectures than the host's, make sure  to  install  the  matching  architecture  version  of
       <b>libgtk3-nocsd.so.0</b>  both  in the <b>setarch</b> environment and the host's environment. Note that the <b>gtk3-nocsd</b>
       binary must then be installed in a system path (<u><a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a></u>, <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u>,  ...),  so  that  it  will  set
       LD_PRELOAD  to  just  the  library  name  and let the dynamic linker find it automatically - allowing the
       dynamic linker to pick the version for the correct architecture. If <b>gtk3-nocsd</b>  is  not  installed  in  a
       system path, it will use a full path, allowing only for a single version of the library to be used.

                                                  October 2015                                     <u><a href="../man1/gtk3-nocsd.1.html">gtk3-nocsd</a></u>(1)
