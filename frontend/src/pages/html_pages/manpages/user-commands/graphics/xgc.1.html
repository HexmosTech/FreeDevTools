       xgc - X graphics demo

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xgc</b> [-<u>toolkitoption</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>xgc</u>  program  demonstrates various features of the X graphics primitives.  In X, most of the details
       about the graphics to be generated are stored in a resource called a  graphics  context  (GC).   The  <b>xgc</b>
       program  provides  a  user interface for setting various GC components.  Pressing the "Run" button causes
       these results to be displayed in the large drawing window on the right.  Timing information is  displayed
       in the window immediately below.

       The items in the upper left hand window work as follows:

       <u>Function</u>  -  specify  the  logical  function with which primitives will drawn.  The most usual setting is
       "set", i.e. simply to render pixels without regard to what has been drawn before.

       <u>LineStyle</u> - specify whether  lines  should  be  drawn  solid  in  foreground,  dashed  in  foreground  or
       alternating foreground and background.

       <u>CapStyle</u> - specify the appearance of the ends of a line.

       <u>JoinStyle</u>  -  specify  the  appearance of joints between consecutive lines drawn within a single graphics
       primitive.

       <u>FillStyle</u> - specify whether lines, text and fill requests are solid, tiled with a pixmap or stippled.

       <u>FillRule</u> - specifies the rule used to fill polygons.  The EvenOdd rule means that if areas overlap an odd
       number of times, they are not drawn.  Winding rule  means  that  overlapping  areas  are  always  filled,
       regardless of how many times they overlap.

       <u>ArcMode</u>  -  specifies  the  rule  for  filling of arcs.  The boundary of the arc is either a Chord or two
       radii.

       <u>planemask</u> - specifies which planes of the drawing window  are  modified.   By  default,  all  planes  are
       modified.

       <u>dashlist</u> - specifies a pattern to be used when drawing dashed lines.

       <u>Line</u>  <u>Width</u>  - specifies the width in pixels of lines to be drawn.  Zero means to draw using the server's
       fastest algorithm with a line width of one pixel.

       <u>Font</u> - specifies the font to be used for text primitives.

       <u>Foreground</u> and <u>Background</u> - specify the  pixel  values  to  be  applied  when  drawing  primitives.   The
       Foreground value is used as the pixel value for set bits in the source in all primitives.  The Background
       value  is  used as the pixel value for unset bits in the source when using Copy Plane, drawing lines with
       LineStyle of DoubleDash and filling with FillStyle of OpaqueStippled.

       <u>Percentage</u> <u>of</u> <u>Test</u> - scrollbar permits specifying only a percentage of the test to be run.  The number at
       the left indicates the current setting, which defaults to 100%.

       The window labeled "Test" permits choice of one a number of graphics primitive tests,  including  Points,
       Segments, Lines, Arcs and Filled Arcs, 8-bit Text and Image Text, Rectangles and Filled Rectangles, Image
       draws, as well as Copy Plane and Copy Area.

       The window to the right of this has buttons which permit record/playback of the primitives rendered.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xgc</u> accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options.

</pre><h4><b>X</b> <b>DEFAULTS</b></h4><pre>
       This program accepts the usual defaults for toolkit applications.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> to get the default host and display number.

       <b>XENVIRONMENT</b>
               to  get  the  name  of  a  resource  file  that  overrides  the  global  resources  stored in the
               RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This program isn't really finished yet, but it probably never will be, since  it  only  demonstrates  the
       original X11 core protocol rendering operations, which few modern programs use anymore.
