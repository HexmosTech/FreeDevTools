</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>ng4ex</u> provides the user with access to several C, Fortran, and NCL examples illustrating the use  of  the
       NCAR  Graphics  HLUs  (High  Level  Utilities)  and  NCL.  Please note that NCL is not available for Cray
       systems.

       <u>ng4ex</u> copies the source code for the specified example(s) into the current directory and  then  compiles,
       links, and executes the example (if it's a Fortran or C program) or runs NCL on it (if it's an NCL script
       file).   Depending on the example, the output may be sent to an NCGM (NCAR Graphics Metafile) file and/or
       displayed to an X window on your screen.  You must be running X and have  your  DISPLAY  environment  set
       correctly in order for the X window examples to execute properly.

       If  the  requested example creates an NCGM file, it will have the same name as the example, suffixed with
       ".ncgm". An option allows you to request that only the source code be copied to your  directory,  without
       compiling  or  running the example.  Another option allows you to request that only the NCGM file be left
       in your directory and that all other files created by  <b>ng4ex</b>  be  deleted.   The  argument  <u>name</u>  may  be
       selected from the lists that appear below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-A</u>     Generate all available examples.

                         instead  of  being copied or generated.  This option must be used with one of the other
                         options that selects a particular subset of examples.  For example, if you want to  see
                         a list of all the available examples, then use <u>-list</u> in conjunction with the <u>-A</u> option.

                 The same as example xy01c, only with some of the X and Y axis resources tweaked.

       xy03c,xy03f,xy03n
                 The same as example xy01c, but with the data modified a little, and the line resources tweaked.

       xy04c,xy04f,xy04n
                 Demonstrates how to create an xyPlot with multiple lines.   Some  of  the  line  resources  are
                 tweaked.

       xy05c,xy05f,xy05n
                 Demonstrates how to create an XyPlot with multiple lines, using multiple data items (except for
                 xy05c, which uses the CoordArrTable object).

       xy06c,xy06f,xy06n
                 Demonstrates how to read in netCDF files to generate various xy plots.

       xy07c,xy07f,xy07n
                 Demonstrates how to draw a "scattergram".

       xy08c,xy08f,xy08n
                 Shows how to use irregular points to change the transformation of your plot.

       xy09c,xy09f,xy09n
                 Shows how to create different kinds of axes.

       xy10c,xy10f,xy10n
                 Shows how to overlay an XyPlot on a MapPlot.

       xy11c,xy11f,xy11n
                 Demonstrates how to display an xyPlot to an X Window, and then copy it to a meta file.

       xy12c     Demonstrates  how to incorporate the HLU library with a GUI.  It uses an X/Motif interface, and
                 also allows the user to copy frames from the X Window to a meta file.

       xy13c     Shows how to interactively retrieve data values from a plot by pointing  and  clicking  on  the
                 plot.

       xy14c,xy14f,xy14n
                 Demonstrates the data manipulation capabilities of NCL.

       xy15c,xy15f,xy15n
                 Demonstrates the creation of a set of four stacked XyPlots.

       xy16c,xy16f,xy16n
                 Demonstrates  how  to  draw  three different xy lines on the same plot, but with different axis
                 scales.

       xy17c,xy17f,xy17n
                 Demonstrates how to stack three xy plots.
