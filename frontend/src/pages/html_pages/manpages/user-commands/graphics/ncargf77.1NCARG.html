       ncargf77 - Command for compiling Fortran code that uses the NCAR Graphics low-level utilities

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ncargf77</b> [<b>-ngmath</b>] [<b>-smooth</b>] [<b>-quick</b>] [<b>-super</b>] [<b>-agupwrtx</b>] [<b>-ncarbd</b>] [<b>-ngmathbd</b>] [<b>-ictrans</b>] [<b>-noX11</b>] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>ncargf77</u>  is a script that invokes the FORTRAN 77 compiler/linker with the proper NCAR Graphics LLU (low-
       level utility) libraries.  Arguments presented above  are  associated  with  NCAR  Graphics.   All  other
       arguments and options are identical to the f77 command on your particular machine; arguments that include
       quoted strings may have to be enclosed in single quotes.

       NOTE:  <u>ncargf77</u>  cannot  be used to compile NCAR Graphics Fortran programs that call the HLUs (high-level
       utilities).  You must use <u>nhlf77</u> instead.  See the <u>nhlf77</u> man page for more information.

       In order to run <u>ncargf77</u>, you must have  your  NCARG_ROOT  environment  variable  set  to  the  directory
       pathname  where  the NCAR Graphics libraries, binaries, and include files were installed.  If you are not
       sure what NCARG_ROOT should be  set  to,  please  check  with  your  system  administrator  or  the  site
       representative  for  NCAR Graphics.  If the NCAR Graphics libraries, binaries, and include files were not
       installed under one root directory, then you will  need  to  set  the  environment  variables  NCARG_LIB,
       NCARG_BIN, and NCARG_INCLUDE instead.  Please see "man ncargintro" for more information.

       Note that, on some systems, if you supply your own binary libraries in addition to the ones automatically
       referenced by <u>ncargf77</u>, all the libraries must have been created in a similar fashion.

       <u>OPTIONS</u>

       -ngmath
              Links in the NCAR Graphics ngmath library.

       -smooth
              Link in the "smooth" objects.

       -quick Link in the "quick" objects.

       -super Link in the "super" objects.

       -agupwrtx
              Link in the "agupwrtx" library.

       -ictrans
              When  <u>ncargf77</u>  is  invoked  with the this option, the resulting executable will, upon invocation,
              send its metafile output to the translator <b>ictrans</b>. The environment variable GRAPHCAP must be  set
              to a valid graphics output device whenever the executable is executed.

       -ncarbd
              Use  this  option for compilers that appear to be having trouble initializing blockdata variables.
              It will cause a small subroutine to be linked  in  that  helps  force  the  loading  of  blockdata
              initialization routines.

       -ngmathbd
              Just  like with the <b>-ncarbd</b> option, use this option for compilers that appear to be having trouble
              initializing Ngmath-related blockdata variables. It will cause a small subroutine to be linked  in
              that helps force the loading of Ngmath blockdata initialization routines.

              Note: this option doesn't need to be specified separately if you are already including the <b>-ncarbd</b>
              and <b>-ngmath</b> options.

       -noX11 Do not link in the X library when linking the code.

              By default, <u>ncargf77</u> will load the X11 library when linking your Fortran program.  This is because
              the  GKS  library  now  has an X11 driver.  If you try running <u>ncargf77</u> and the compiler complains
              that it cannot find the library for X11, then try running <u>ncargf77</u> <u>-L/xxx/yyy/zzz</u> <u>program.f</u>  where
              <u>/xxx/yyy/zzz</u> is the path leading to your X11 library.  If you do not have the X11 library, or else
              you just don't want it to be loaded, you can use the <b>-noX11</b> option.
