</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bmore - browse through a binary file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bmore</b>  [  <b>-acdir</b>  ]  [  <b>-n</b>  <u>lines</u>  ]  [ <b>-w</b> <u>cols</u> ] [ <b>+</b><u>linenumber</u> ] [ <b>+/</b><u>ASCII-pattern</u> ] [ <b>+\</b><u>Hex-pattern</u> ] [
       <u>filename</u> ... ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>more</b> is a filter that displays the contents of a binary file on the terminal, one screenful  at  a  time.
       It normally pauses after each screenful, and prints <b>--More--</b> at the bottom of the screen.  <b>bmore</b> provides
       a  two-line  overlap between screens for continuity.  If <b>bmore</b> is reading from a file rather than a pipe,
       the percentage of characters displayed so far is also shown.

       <b>bmore</b> scrolls up to display one more screen line in response to a RETURN character; it  displays  another
       screenful in response to a SPACE character.  Other commands are listed below.

       The  screen is divided in three sections or panes: The byte offset (extreme left), the hex pane (middle),
       and an ascii pane (right) which shows as printable characters those bytes in the  hex  pane.   On  an  80
       column  terminal  there will be sixteen hex values and their ASCII values on each screen line.  Note that
       (as one would expect) the first byte has the offset '0' (zero).

       <b>bmore</b> sets the terminal to <u>noecho</u> mode, so that the output can be continuous.  Commands that you type  do
       not normally show up on your terminal, except for the <b>/</b> , <b>\</b> and <b>!</b>  commands.

       If  the  standard  output is not a terminal, <b>more</b> acts just like <b><a href="../man1V/cat.1V.html">cat</a></b>(1V), except that a header is printed
       before each file in a series.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>     ASCII mode: no hex representation of the contents. Non printable characters are displayed as a dot
              (.)

       <b>-c</b>     Clear before displaying. Redrawing the screen instead of scrolling.

       <b>-d</b>     Display error messages rather than ringing the terminal bell if an unrecognized command  is  used.
              This is helpful for inexperienced users.

       <b>-i</b>     Ignore case for searching.

       <b>-n</b> <u>lines</u>
              Displays  the  indicated number of <u>lines</u> in each screenful, rather than the default (the number of
              lines in the terminal screen less two).

       <b>-r</b>     Characters between 160 - 254 are displayed as "reverse video text" as used in some legacy  systems
              (Atari, Commodore, Apple II, etc).

       <b>-w</b> <u>cols</u>
              Display number of <u>cols</u> in each line.

       <b>+</b><u>linenumber</u>
              Start up at <u>linenumber</u>.

       <b>+/</b><u>ASCII-pattern</u>
              Start  up  at  the  line  containing  the  regular expression <u>pattern</u>.  Note: unlike editors, this
              construct should <u>not</u> end with a `<b>/</b>'.  If it does, then the trailing slash is taken as a  character
              in the search pattern.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Commands</b>
       The  commands  take  effect  immediately;  it is not necessary to type a carriage return.  Up to the time
       when the command character itself is given, the user may type the  line  kill  character  to  cancel  the
       numerical  argument  being  formed.   In addition, the user may type the erase character to redisplay the
       `<b>--More--(</b><u>xx</u><b>%)</b>' message.

       In the following commands, <u>i</u> is a numerical argument (<b>1</b> by default).

       <u>i</u>SPACE    Display another screenful, or <u>i</u> more lines if <u>i</u> is specified.

       <u>i</u>RETURN   Display another line, or <u>i</u> more lines, if specified.

       <u>i</u><b>^D</b>       (CTRL-D) Display (scroll down) 11 more lines.  <u>i</u> is given, the scroll size is set to <u>i</u>.

       <u>i</u>d        Same as <b>^D</b>.

       <u>i</u><b>z</b>        Same as SPACE, except that <u>i</u>,  if  present,  becomes  the  new  default  number  of  lines  per
                 screenful.

       <u>i</u><b>s</b>        Skip <u>i</u> lines and then print a screenful.

       <u>i</u><b>f</b>        Skip <u>i</u> screenfuls and then print a screenful.

       <u>i</u><b>^B</b>       (CTRL-B) Skip back <u>i</u> screenfuls and then print a screenful.

       <u>b</u>         Same as <b>^B</b> (CTRL-D).

       <b>q</b>
       <b>Q</b>         Exit from <b>more</b>.

       <b>=</b>         Display the current line number.

       <b>v</b>         Drop into the <b><a href="../man1/bvi.1.html">bvi</a></b>(1) editor at the current offset of the current file.

       <b>w</b>         Drop  into the <b><a href="../man1/bvi.1.html">bvi</a></b>(1) editor at the current offset of the current file. Only the portion of the
                 file displayed on the screen will be loaded.

       <b>h</b>         Help.  Give a description of all the <b>more</b> commands.

       <u>i</u><b>/</b><u>pattern</u> Search for the <u>i</u>th occurrence  of  the  regular  expression  <u>pattern</u>.   Display  the  screenful
                 starting  at  the  file  position that contains the <u>i</u>th match for the regular expression <u>ASCII-</u>
                 <u>pattern</u>, or the end of a pipe, whichever comes first.  If <b>bmore</b> is displaying a file and  there
                 is  no  such  match,  its  position  in the file remains unchanged.  Regular expressions can be
                 edited using erase and kill characters.  Erasing back past the first column cancels the  search
                 command.

       <b>'</b>         Single  quote.   Go  to  the  point  from which the last search started.  If no search has been
                 performed in the current file, go to the beginning of the file.

       <b>!</b><u>command</u>  Invoke a shell to execute <u>command</u>.  The characters <b>%</b>  and  <b>!</b>,  when  used  within  <u>command</u>  are
                 replaced  with  the current filename and the previous shell command, respectively.  If there is
                 no current filename, <b>%</b> is not expanded. Prepend a  backslash  to  these  characters  to  escape
                 expansion.

       <u>i</u><b>:n</b>       Skip to the <u>i</u>th next filename given in the command line, or to the last filename in the list if
                 <u>i</u> is out of range.

       <u>i</u><b>:p</b>       Skip  to  the <u>i</u>th previous filename given in the command line, or to the first filename if <u>i</u> is
                 out of range.  If given while <b>more</b> is positioned within a file, go  to  the  beginning  of  the
                 file.  If <b>more</b> is reading from a pipe, <b>more</b> simply rings the terminal bell.

       <b>:f</b>        Display the current filename and offset number.

       <b>:q</b>
       <b>:Q</b>        Exit from <b>bmore</b> (same as <b>q</b> or <b>Q</b> <b>).</b>

       <b>.</b>         Dot.  Repeat the previous command.
