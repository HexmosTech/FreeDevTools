</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nitpic - a Microchip PIC simulator

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nitpic</b>  is  an  X  Window  System-based  simulator  for the Microchip PIC series of microcontrollers.  It
       currently supports the PIC16C84 only, but it should be trivial to add support for the  rest  of  the  PIC
       family, and pretty easy even for unrelated CPUs.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>SHORTCOMINGS</b></h4><pre>
       •      The 16C84 EEPROM data memory is not implemented.

       •      Writing PCL doesn't cause a jump.

       •      Interrupts, including RTCC rollover, don't work.

       •      The "File" button doesn't let you load a new object file.

       •      No warning on stack overflow.

       •      The   I/O  ports  aren't  handled  properly  (there's  something  screwy  about  read/modify/write
              instructions that I don't understand yet).

       •      I'm not sure the ADD and SUB instructions set C and DC properly.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       •      Sometimes the instruction pointer gets screwed up (graphics only — the simulator keeps working).

       This manual page was written by Colin Watson for Debian because the original  program  does  not  have  a
       manual  page.   It  is  a simple translation of parts of <b>nitpic</b>'s <u>README</u> into the manual page format; see
       that file for more information.
