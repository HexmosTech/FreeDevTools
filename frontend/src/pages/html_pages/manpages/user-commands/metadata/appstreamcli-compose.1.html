</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       appstreamcli-compose - Compose AppStream metadata catalog from directory trees

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>appstreamcli</b> <b>compose</b> [<b>COMMAND</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>appstreamcli</b> <b>compose</b> command.

       The <b>appstreamcli</b> <b>compose</b> tool is used to construct AppStream metadata catalogs from directory trees. The
       tool will also perform many related metadata generation actions, like resizing icons and screenshots and
       merging in data from referenced desktop-entry files as well as translation status information. Therefore,
       the tool provides a fast way to test how the final processed metadata for an application that is shipped
       to users may look like. It also provides a way to easily generate AppStream data for projects which do
       not need a more complex data generator like <b>appstream-generator</b>.

       In order for the <b>appstreamcli</b> <b>compose</b> command to be available, you may need to install the optional
       compose module for <b>appstreamcli</b> first.

       For more information about the AppStream project and the other components which are part of it, take a
       look at the AppStream pages at <b>Freedesktop.org</b>[1].

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>SOURCE-DIRECTORIES</u>
           A list of directories to process needs to be provided as positional parameters. Data from all
           directories will be combined into one output namespace.

       <b>--origin</b> <u>NAME</u>
           Set the AppStream data origin identifier. This can be a value like "debian-unstable-main" or
           "flathub".

       <b>--result-root</b> <u>DIR</u>
           Sets the directory where all generated output that is deployed to a user's machine is exported to. If
           this parameter is not set and we only have one directory to process, we use that directory as default
           output path.

           If both <b>--data-dir</b> and <b>--icons-dir</b> are set, <b>--result-root</b> is not necessary and no data will be
           written to that directory.

       <b>--data-dir</b> <u>DIR</u>
           Override the directory where the generated AppStream metadata catalog will be written to. Data will
           be written directly to this directory, and no supdirectories will be created (unlike when using
           <b>--result-root</b> to set an output location).

       <b>--icons-dir</b> <u>DIR</u>
           Override the directory where the cached icons are exported to.

       <b>--hints-dir</b> <u>DIR</u>
           Set a directory where hints reported generated during metadata processing are saved to. If this
           parameter is not set, no HTML/YAML hint reports will be saved.

       <b>--media-dir</b> <u>DIR</u>
           If set, creates a directory with media content (icons, screenshots, ...) that can be served via a
           webserver. The metadata will be extended to include information about these remote media.

       <b>--media-baseurl</b> <u>URL</u>
           The URL under which the contents of a directory set via <b>--media-dir</b> will be served. This value must
           be set if a media directory is created.

       <b>--prefix</b> <u>DIR</u>
           Set the default prefix that is used in the processed directories. If none is set explicitly, <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> is
           assumed.

       <b>--print-report</b> <u>MODE</u>
           Print the issue hints report (that gets exported as HTML and YAML document when <b>--hints-dir</b> was set)
           to the console in text form.

           Various print modes are supported: <u>on-error</u> only prints a short report if the run failed (default),
           <u>short</u> generates an abridged report that is always printed and <u>full</u> results in a detailed report to be
           printed.

       <b>--no-partial-urls</b>
           If set, all URLs in the generated data will be absolute and media_baseurl will not be used. This
           makes changing the media mirror harder without regenerating all data and is generally not
           recommended, to increase flexibility.

       <b>--icon-policy</b> <u>POLICY-STRING</u>
           Override the existing icon policy with a custom one. The icon policy sets how icons of different
           sizes should be dealt with. They can be in the icon cache only, be a remote icon in the media
           location or be both cached and available in the remote location.

           The icon-policy string is comprised of comma-separated %{size}x%{size}@%{scale}=%{state} statements.
           The size and scale are that of the respective icon, with the scale being allowed to be omitted if it
           is 1. The state can be one of remote, cached or cached-remote.

           By default, a policy of
           48x48=cached,48x48@2=cached,64x64=cached,64x64@2=cached,128x128=cached-remote,128x128@2=cached-remote
           is selected.

       <b>--allow-custom</b> <u>CUSTOM-KEY-NAMES</u>
           By default, all custom entries set in MetaInfo input data are removed. This flag allows one to
           whitelist custom keys to be propagated to the final catalog output data. The custom-key names should
           be provided as a comma-separated list.

       <b>--components</b> <u>COMPONENT-IDs</u>
           Set a comma-separated list of AppStream component IDs that should be considered for the generated
           metadata. All components that exist in the input data but are not mentioned in this list will be
           ignored for the generated output.

       <b>--no-color</b>
           Don't print colored output.

       <b>--verbose</b>
           Display extra debugging information

       <b>--version</b>
           Display the version number of appstreamcli compose
