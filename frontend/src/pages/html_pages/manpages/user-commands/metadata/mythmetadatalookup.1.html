       mythmetadatalookup - MythTV metadata lookup

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       mythmetadatalookup  version:  fixes/35  [v35.0+fixes.20250302.f3f012aa3f-0ubuntu4]  www.mythtv.org  Misc.
       Options:

       <b>--chanid</b>
              Specify chanid of recording to operate on.

       <b>--refresh-rules</b>
              Also update inetref for recording rules when metadata is found for a recording (Best effort  only,
              imperfect)

       <b>--refresh-all</b>
              Batch  update  recorded  program  metadata. If a recording's rule has an inetref but the recording
              does not, it will be inherited.

       <b>--refresh-all-artwork</b>
              Batch update artwork for non-generic recording rules and recordings. This is a  more  conservative
              option  which  only  operates  on  items  for which it is likely to be able to find artwork.  This
              option will not overwrite any existing artwork.

       <b>--refresh-all-artwork-dangerously</b>
              Batch update artwork for ALL recording rules and recordings. This will attempt to download fanart,
              coverart, and banner for each season of each recording rule and all recordings. This  option  will
              not  overwrite  any  existing  artwork.  If  a rule or recording has not been looked up, this will
              attempt to look it up. This is a very aggressive option!  Use with care.

       <b>--refresh-all-rules</b>
              Batch update metadata for recording rules.  This will set inetrefs for your recording rules  based
              on  an  automated  lookup.  This  is  a  best  effort, and not guaranteed! If your recordings lack
              inetrefs but one is found for the rule, it will be inherited.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>, <b>--usage</b>
              Display this help printout, or give detailed information of selected option.

       <b>--version</b>
              Display version information.

       <b>--starttime</b>
              Specify start time of recording to operate on.

       Logging Options:

       <b>--loglevel</b>
              Set the logging level.  All log messages at lower levels will be discarded.  In descending  order:
              emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, debug, trace defaults to info

       <b>--loglong</b>
              Use long log format for the console, i.e.  show file, line number, etc. in the console log.

       <b>--logpath</b>
              Writes  logging  messages  to  a  file  in  the  directory  logpath  with filenames in the format:
              applicationName.date.pid.log.  This is typically used in combination with <b>--daemon</b>, and if used in
              combination with <b>--pidfile</b>, this can be used with log rotators,  using  the  HUP  call  to  inform
              MythTV to reload the file

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Don't log to the console (<b>-q</b>).  Don't log anywhere (<b>-q</b> <b>-q</b>)

       <b>--syslog</b>
              Set the syslog logging facility.  Set to "none" to disable, defaults to none.

       <b>--systemd-journal</b>
              Use systemd-journal instead of syslog.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Specify log filtering. Use '-v help' for level info.
