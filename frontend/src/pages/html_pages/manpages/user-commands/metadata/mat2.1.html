</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mat2 - the metadata anonymisation toolkit 2

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mat2</b> [-h] [-v] [-l] [-V] [-s | -L] [<u>files</u> [<u>files</u> <u>...</u>]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mat2</b>  removes  metadata  from  various  fileformats.  It  supports a wide variety of file formats, audio,
       office, images, â€¦

       Careful, mat2 does not clean files in-place, instead, it will produce a  file  with  the  word  "cleaned"
       between   the   filename  and  its  extension,  for  example  "filename.cleaned.png"  for  a  file  named
       "filename.png".

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>
       <b>files</b>  the files to process

   <b>optional</b> <b>arguments:</b>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              show this help message and exit

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
              show program's version number and exit

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
              list all supported fileformats

       <b>--check-dependencies</b>
              check if mat2 has all the dependencies it needs

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              show more verbose status information

       <b>--unknown-members</b> <u>policy</u>
              how to handle unknown members of archive-style files (policy should be one of: abort, omit, keep)

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--show</b>
              list harmful metadata detectable by mat2 without removing them

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--lightweight</b>
              remove SOME metadata

       <b>--no-sandbox</b>
              disable bubblewrap's sandboxing

       <b>--inplace</b>
              clean in place, without backup

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To remove all the metadata from a PDF file:

              mat2 ./myfile.pdf

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>ABOUT</b> <b>METADATA</b></h4><pre>
       While mat2 is doing its very best to display metadata when the --show flag is  passed,  it  doesn't  mean
       that a file is clean from any metadata if mat2 doesn't show any. There is no reliable way to detect every
       single possible metadata for complex file formats.

       This is why you shouldn't rely on metadata's presence to decide if your file must be cleaned or not.

       Moreover,  mat2  goes  to  great lengths to make sure that as much metadata as possible are removed. This
       might sometimes result in a loss of quality of the processed files. For example, textual based  pdf  file
       converted  into  image based one means that it'll be no longer possible to select text in them. If you're
       experiencing this, you might want to give the lightweight cleaning mode a try, but keep in mind by  doing
       so, some metadata <b>won't</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       While mat2 does its very best to remove every single metadata, it's still in beta, and <b>some</b> might remain.
       Should you encounter some issues, check the bugtracker: https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2/issues

       Please use accordingly and be careful.
