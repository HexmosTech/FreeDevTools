</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sc-im - A curses based, vim-like spreadsheet calculator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sc-im</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>FILE</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sc-im</b> Is a curses based spreadsheet calculator program with vim like key bindings.

       SC-IM is a spreadsheet program based on SC

       A  spreadsheet  is  an  interactive computer application program for organization and analysis of data in
       tabular form. Spreadsheets are developed as computerized simulations of paper accounting worksheets.  The
       program  operates  on  data represented as cells of an array, organized in rows and columns. Each cell of
       the array is a model–view–controller element that can contain either numeric or text data, or the results
       of formulas that automatically calculate and display a value based on the contents of other cells.

       The user of the spreadsheet can make changes in any stored value and observe the  effects  on  calculated
       values.  This  makes  the  spreadsheet  useful  for  "what-if"  analysis  since many cases can be rapidly
       investigated without  tedious  manual  recalculation.  Modern  spreadsheet  software  can  have  multiple
       interacting  sheets,  and  can display data either as text and numerals, or in graphical form. SC-IM uses
       ncurses for visual interface and has vim-like keybindings and some functional similarities with vim  text
       editor.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Input</b> <b>Control</b>
       <u>FILE</u>   The input file from where to read the spreadsheet.

       <b>--sheet=SHEET</b>
              Open SHEET when loading xlsx file. Can be sheet name or number. Default is '1'.

   <b>Version</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Print  the version number of Sc-im and exit.  It also shows which features were enabled when Sc-im
              was compiled.

   <b>External</b> <b>scripts</b>
       <b>--nocurses</b>
              Run interactive but without ncurses interface.

       <b>--output=FILE</b>
              Save the results in FILE.

       <b>--quit_afterload</b>
              Quit after loading all the files.  Useful when sending scripts to SC-IM.

       <b>--quiet</b>
              Set variable 'quiet'. Avoid printing info/error/debug messages.

   <b>Other</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>variables</b>
       <b>--autocalc</b>
              Set variable 'autocalc'. Recalculations occur automatically.

       <b>--numeric</b>
              Set variable 'numeric'. A digit starts a numeric value instead of a command multiplier.

       <b>--half_page_scroll</b>
              Set variable 'half_page_scroll'. &lt;c-f&gt;, &lt;c-b&gt; and other scroll mappings scroll half  page  instead
              of full page.

       <b>--newline_action=VAL</b>
              Set  variable  'newline_action'  VAL to <u>j</u> to move the cursor down after an entry. Set to <u>l</u> to move
              the cursor right after an entry.

       <b>--external_functions</b>
              Set variable 'external_functions'. Enable external functions.

       <b>--xlsx_readformulas</b>
              Set variable 'xlsx_readformulas'. SC-IM will try to import formulas, rather than the final  values
              of a cell.

</pre><h4><b>COLOR</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       Most  terminals  are  able  to  display  256 colors these days. But some of them enable only 16 colors by
       default. To enjoy <b>sc-im</b>'s full capabilities, these terminals need to be  signaled  to  enable  256  color
       mode. This is usually done by setting the TERM environment variable.

       <b>export</b> <b>TERM=xterm-256color</b>

</pre><h4><b>KEYBOARD</b> <b>CONTROLS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>h,</b> <b>j,</b> <b>k,</b> <b>l,</b> <b>Arrow</b> <b>keys</b>
              Move between cells.

       <b>PgUp,</b> <b>pgDn</b>
              One page UP or DOWN.

       <b>gg</b>     Jump to the first cell.

       <b>v</b>      Starts visual selection.

       <b>^</b>      Move the cell cursor to row 0 of the current column.

       <b>0</b>      Move the cell cursor backward to column A of the current row.

       <b>$</b>      Move the cell cursor forward to the last valid column of the current row.

       <b>b</b>      Move the cell cursor back to the previous valid cell.

       <b>w</b>      Move the cell cursor forward to the next valid cell.

       <b>g0</b>     Move the cell cursor to the first visible column of the screen.

       <b>g$</b>     Move the cell cursor to the last visible column of the screen.

       <b>gM</b>     Move the cell cursor to the middle column of the screen.

       <b>gH</b>     Go to fist visible row on the screen.

       <b>gL</b>     Go to last visible row on the screen.

       <b>gM</b>     Go to middle row on the screen.

       <b>m</b><u>x</u>     Mark the current cell.

       <b>'</b><u>x</u>     Jump to a marked cell.

       <b>=</b>      Enter a numeric constant or expression into the current cell.

       <b>&lt;</b>      Enter a label string into the current cell. Left aligned

       <b>&gt;</b>      Enter a label string into the current cell. Right aligned

       <b>{</b>      Left justify the string in the current cell.

       <b>}</b>      Right justify the string in the current cell.

       <b>|</b>      Center the string in the current cell.

       <b>e</b>      Edit  the  value  associated  with  the  current cell.  This is identical to ``='' except that the
              command line starts out containing the old numeric value or expression associated with  the  cell.
              The editing in this mode is vi-like.

       <b>E</b>      Edit  the  string  associated  with the current cell.  This is identical to ``&lt;'', ``\'', or ``&gt;''
              except that the command line starts out containing the old string value or  expression  associated
              with the cell.  The editing in this mode is vi-like.

       <b>x</b>      Clear  the  current  cell.   Deletes  the  numeric  value,  label string, and/or numeric or string
              expression.

       <b>:</b>      Enter COMMAND mode.
