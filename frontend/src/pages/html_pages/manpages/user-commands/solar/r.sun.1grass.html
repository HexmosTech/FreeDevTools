</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>r.sun</b>  - Solar irradiance and irradiation model.
       Computes  direct  (beam),  diffuse  and  reflected solar irradiation raster maps for given day, latitude,
       surface  and  atmospheric  conditions.  Solar  parameters  (e.g.  sunrise,  sunset  times,   declination,
       extraterrestrial  irradiance,  daylight length) are saved in the map history file. Alternatively, a local
       time can be specified to compute solar incidence angle  and/or  irradiance  raster  maps.  The  shadowing
       effect of the topography is optionally incorporated.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>r.sun</b> computes beam (direct), diffuse and ground reflected solar irradiation raster maps for  given  day,
       latitude,  surface  and  atmospheric  conditions.  Solar  parameters  (e.g.  time  of sunrise and sunset,
       declination, extraterrestrial irradiance, daylight length) are stored  in  the  resultant  maps’  history
       files.  Alternatively, the local time can be specified to compute solar incidence angle and/or irradiance
       raster maps. The shadowing effect of the topography is incorporated by default. This can be  done  either
       internally  by  calculation  of  the  shadowing  effect  directly  from the digital elevation model or by
       specifying raster maps of the horizon height which is much faster.  These  horizon  raster  maps  can  be
       calculated using r.horizon.

       For latitude-longitude coordinates it requires that the elevation map is in meters.  The rules are:

           •   lat/lon coordinates: elevation in meters;

           •   Other coordinates: elevation in the same unit as the easting-northing coordinates.
       The  solar  geometry  of the model is based on the works of Krcho (1990), later improved by Jenco (1992).
       The equations describing Sun -- Earth position as well as an interaction  of  the  solar  radiation  with
       atmosphere  were  originally  based on the formulas suggested by Kitler and Mikler (1986). This component
       was considerably updated by the results and suggestions of the working group co-ordinated by Scharmer and
       Greif (2000) (this algorithm might be replaced by  SOLPOS  algorithm-library  included  in  GRASS  within
       r.sunmask  command).  The  model  computes  all  three  components of global radiation (beam, diffuse and
       reflected) for the clear sky conditions, i.e. not taking into  consideration  the  spatial  and  temporal
       variation  of clouds. The extent and spatial resolution of the modelled area, as well as integration over
       time, are limited only by the memory and data storage resources. The model is built to fulfil user  needs
       in  various fields of science (hydrology, climatology, ecology and environmental sciences, photovoltaics,
       engineering, etc.) for continental, regional up to the landscape scales.

       The model considers a shadowing effect of the local topography unless switched  off  with  the  <u>-p</u>  flag.
       <b>r.sun</b>  works in two modes: In the first mode it calculates for the set local time a solar incidence angle
       [degrees] and solar irradiance values [W.m-2].   In  the  second  mode  daily  sums  of  solar  radiation
       [Wh.m-2.day-1] are computed within a set day. By a scripting the two modes can be used separately or in a
       combination to provide estimates for any desired time interval. The model accounts for sky obstruction by
       local relief features. Several solar parameters are saved in the resultant maps’ history files, which may
       be viewed with the r.info command.

       The  solar  incidence  angle  raster  map <u>incidout</u> is computed specifying elevation raster map <u>elevation</u>,
       aspect raster map <u>aspect</u>, slope steepness raster map <u>slope,</u> given the day <u>day</u> and local time <u>time</u>.  There
       is  no  need  to define latitude for projects with known and defined coordinate system (check it with the
       g.proj command). If you have undefined projection, (x,y) system, etc. then the latitude  can  be  defined
       explicitly for large areas by input raster map <u>lat_in</u> with interpolated latitude values. All input raster
       maps must be floating point (FCELL) raster maps. Null data in maps are excluded from the computation (and
       also speeding-up the computation), so each output raster map will contain null data in cells according to
       all  input  raster  maps. The user can use r.null command to create/reset null file for your input raster
       maps.
       The specified day <u>day</u> is the number of the day of the general year  where  January  1  is  day  no.1  and
       December  31  is  365.  Time  <u>time</u>  must be a local (solar) time (i.e. NOT a zone time, e.g. GMT, CET) in
       decimal system, e.g. 7.5 (= 7h 30m A.M.), 16.1 = 4h 6m P.M..

       The solar <u>declination</u> parameter is an option to override the value computed by the internal  routine  for
       the  day  of the year. The value of geographical latitude can be set as a constant for the whole computed
       region or, as an option, a grid representing spatially  distributed  values  over  a  large  region.  The
       geographical  latitude  must  be  also in decimal system with positive values for northern hemisphere and
       negative for southern one.  In similar principle the Linke turbidity factor  (<u>linke</u>,  <u>lin</u>  )  and  ground
       albedo (<u>albedo</u>, <u>alb</u>) can be set.

       Besides  clear-sky  radiations,  the user can compute a real-sky radiation (beam, diffuse) using <u>coeff_bh</u>
       and <u>coeff_dh</u> input raster maps defining the fraction of the respective clear-sky  radiations  reduced  by
       atmospheric  factors  (e.g.  cloudiness).  The  value  is  between 0-1. Usually these coefficients can be
       obtained from a long-terms meteorological measurements provided as raster maps with spatial  distribution
       of  these  coefficients  separately  for beam and diffuse radiation (see Suri and Hofierka, 2004, section
       3.2).

       The solar irradiation or irradiance raster maps <u>beam_rad</u>, <u>diff_rad</u>, <u>refl_rad</u> are computed for a given day
       <u>day,</u> latitude <u>lat_in</u>, elevation <u>elevation</u>, slope <u>slope</u> and aspect <u>aspect</u> raster maps.   For  convenience,
       the  output  raster  given as <u>glob_rad</u> will output the sum of the three radiation components. The program
       uses the Linke atmosphere turbidity factor and ground albedo coefficient.  A  default,  single  value  of
       Linke  factor  is  <u>lin</u>=3.0  and  is near the annual average for rural-city areas. The Linke factor for an
       absolutely clear atmosphere is <u>lin</u>=1.0. See notes below to learn more about this  factor.  The  incidence
       solar angle is the angle between horizon and solar beam vector.

       The  solar  radiation  maps  for  a given day are computed by integrating the relevant irradiance between
       sunrise and sunset times for that day. The user can set a finer or coarser time  step  used  for  all-day
       radiation  calculations  with  the <u>step</u> option. The default value of <u>step</u> is 0.5 hour. Larger steps (e.g.
       1.0-2.0) can speed-up calculations but produce less reliable (and more jagged) results. As the sun  moves
       through  approx.   15° of the sky in an hour, the default <u>step</u> of half an hour will produce 7.5° steps in
       the data. For relatively smooth output with the sun placed for every degree of movement in  the  sky  you
       should  set  the <u>step</u> to 4 minutes or less. <u>step</u>=0.05 is equivalent to every 3 minutes. Of course setting
       the time step to be very fine proportionally increases the module’s running time.

       The output units are in Wh per squared meter per  given  day  [Wh/(m*m)/day].  The  incidence  angle  and
       irradiance/irradiation  maps  are  computed with the shadowing influence of relief by default. It is also
       possible for them to be computed without this influence using the planar flag (<u>-p</u>).  In mountainous areas
       this can lead to very different results! The user should be aware that taking into account the  shadowing
       effect of relief can slow down the speed of computation, especially when the sun altitude is low.

       When  considering  the  shadowing  effect,  speed  and  precision of computation can be controlled by the
       <u>distance_step</u> parameter, which defines the sampling density at which the visibility of  a  grid  cell  is
       computed in the direction of a path of the solar flow. It also defines the method by which the obstacle’s
       altitude  is computed. When choosing a <u>distance_step</u> less than 1.0 (i.e. sampling points will be computed
       at <u>distance_step</u> * cellsize distance), <u>r.sun</u> takes the altitude from the nearest grid point. Values above
       1.0 will use the maximum altitude value found in the nearest 4 surrounding grid points. The default value
       <u>distance_step</u>=1.0 should give reasonable results for most cases (e.g.  on DEM). The  <u>distance_step</u>  value
       defines  a  multiplying  coefficient  for  sampling  distance. This basic sampling distance equals to the
       arithmetic average of both cell sizes. The reasonable values are in the range 0.5-1.5.  The values  below
       0.5  will  decrease  and  values above 1.0 will increase the computing speed. Values greater than 2.0 may
       produce estimates with lower accuracy in highly dissected relief. The fully shadowed areas are written to
       the output maps as zero values. Areas with NULL data are considered as no barrier with shadowing effect.

       The maps’ history files are generated containing the following listed parameters used in the computation:
       - Solar constant used W.m-2
       - Extraterrestrial irradiance on a plane perpendicular to the solar beam [W.m-2]
       - Day of the year
       - Declination [radians]
       - Decimal hour (Alternative 1 only)
       - Sunrise and sunset (min-max) over a horizontal plane
       - Daylight lengths
       - Geographical latitude (min-max)
       - Linke turbidity factor (min-max)
       - Ground albedo (min-max)

       The user can use a nice shellcript with variable day to compute radiation for some time  interval  within
       the  year  (e.g.  vegetation  or  winter  period). Elevation, aspect and slope input values should not be
       reclassified into coarser categories. This could lead to incorrect results.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Currently, there are two modes of r.sun.  In the first mode it calculates solar incidence angle and solar
       irradiance raster maps using the set local time. In the second  mode  daily  sums  of  solar  irradiation
       [Wh.m-2.day-1] are computed for a specified day.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Solar  energy  is an important input parameter in different models concerning energy industry, landscape,
       vegetation, evapotranspiration, snowmelt or remote sensing.  Solar  rays  incidence  angle  maps  can  be
       effectively  used  in radiometric and topographic corrections in mountainous and hilly terrain where very
       accurate investigations should be performed.

       The clear-sky solar radiation model applied in the r.sun is based on the work undertaken for  development
       of  European Solar Radiation Atlas (Scharmer and Greif 2000, Page et al. 2001, Rigollier 2001). The clear
       sky model estimates the global radiation from the sum of its beam, diffuse and reflected components.  The
       main difference between solar radiation models for inclined surfaces in Europe is the  treatment  of  the
       diffuse  component.  In  the  European  climate  this component is often the largest source of estimation
       error. Taking into consideration the existing models and their limitation the  European  Solar  Radiation
       Atlas  team  selected the Muneer (1990) model as it has a sound theoretical basis and thus more potential
       for later improvement.

       Planned improvements include the use of the SOLPOS algorithm for solar geometry calculations and internal
       computation of aspect and slope.

   <b>Solar</b> <b>time</b>
       By default r.sun calculates times as true solar time, whereby solar noon is  always  exactly  12  o’clock
       everywhere  in the current region. Depending on where the zone of interest is located in the related time
       zone, this may cause differences of up to an hour, in some cases (like Western Spain) even more.  On  top
       of this, the offset varies during the year according to the Equation of Time.

       To  overcome  this  problem, the user can use the option <u>civil_time=&lt;timezone_offset&gt;</u> in r.sun to make it
       use real-world (wall clock) time. For example, for Central Europe the timezone  offset  is  +1,  +2  when
       daylight saving time is in effect.

   <b>Extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>maps</b>
       A  map  of shadows can be extracted from the solar incidence angle map (incidout). Areas with NULL values
       are shadowed. This will not work if the <u>-p</u> flag has been used.

   <b>Large</b> <b>maps</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> <b>problems</b>
       With a large number or columns and rows, <b>r.sun</b> can consume significant amount  of  memory.  While  output
       raster maps are not partitionable, the input raster maps are using the <u>npartitions</u> parameter.  In case of
       out  of  memory  error  (ERROR:  G_malloc: out of memory), the <u>npartitions</u> parameter can be used to run a
       segmented calculation which consumes less memory during the computations.  The amount of memory by  <b>r.sun</b>
       is estimated as follows:
       # without input raster map partitioning:
       #  memory requirements: 4 bytes per raster cell
       #  rows,cols: rows and columns of current region (find out with g.region)
       #  IR: number of input raster maps without horizon maps
       #  OR: number of output raster maps
       memory_bytes = rows*cols*(IR*4 + horizon_steps + OR*4)
       # with input raster map partitioning:
       memory_bytes = rows*cols*((IR*4+horizon_steps)/npartitions  + OR*4)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       North Carolina example (considering also cast shadows):
       g.region raster=elevation -p
       # calculate horizon angles (to speed up the subsequent r.sun calculation)
       r.horizon elevation=elevation step=30 bufferzone=200 output=horangle \
           maxdistance=5000
       # slope + aspect
       r.slope.aspect elevation=elevation aspect=aspect.dem slope=slope.dem
       # calculate global radiation for day 180 at 2p.m., using r.horizon output
       r.sun elevation=elevation horizon_basename=horangle horizon_step=30 \
             aspect=aspect.dem slope=slope.dem glob_rad=global_rad day=180 time=14
       # result: output global (total) irradiance/irradiation [W.m-2] for given day/time
       r.univar global_rad

       Calculation  of  the  integrated  daily irradiation for a region in North-Carolina for a given day of the
       year at 30m resolution. Here day 172 (i.e., 21 June in non-leap years):
       g.region raster=elev_ned_30m -p
       # considering cast shadows
       r.sun elevation=elev_ned_30m linke_value=2.5 albedo_value=0.2 day=172 \
             beam_rad=b172 diff_rad=d172 \
             refl_rad=r172 insol_time=it172
       d.mon wx0
       # show irradiation raster map [Wh.m-2.day-1]
       d.rast.leg b172
       # show insolation time raster map [h]
       d.rast.leg it172
       We can compute the day of year from a specific date in Python:
       &gt;&gt;&gt; import datetime
       &gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.datetime(2014, 6, 21).timetuple().tm_yday
       172
