</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sphinx-build - Sphinx documentation generator tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sphinx-build</b> [<u>options</u>] &lt;<u>sourcedir</u>&gt; &lt;<u>outputdir</u>&gt; [<u>filenames</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sphinx-build</b> generates documentation from the files in <b>&lt;sourcedir&gt;</b> and places it in the <b>&lt;outputdir&gt;</b>.

       <b>sphinx-build</b>  looks  for <b>&lt;sourcedir&gt;/conf.py</b> for the configuration settings.  <b><a href="../man1/sphinx-quickstart.1.html">sphinx-quickstart</a>(1)</b> may be
       used to generate template files, including <b>conf.py</b>.

       <b>sphinx-build</b> can create documentation in different formats.  A  format  is  selected  by  specifying  the
       builder  name on the command line; it defaults to HTML.  Builders can also perform other tasks related to
       documentation processing.  For a list of available builders, refer to <u>Builders</u>.

       By default, everything that is outdated is built.  Output  only  for  selected  files  can  be  built  by
       specifying individual filenames.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-M</b> <b>buildername</b>
              Select  a  builder,  using  the  <u>make-mode</u>.   See  <u>Builders</u> for a list of all of Sphinx's built-in
              builders.  Extensions can add their own builders.

              <b>IMPORTANT:</b>
                 Sphinx only recognizes the <b>-M</b> option if it is used first, along  with  the  source  and  output
                 directories, before any other options are passed.  For example:

                     sphinx-build -M html ./source ./build --fail-on-warning

              The  <u>make-mode</u>  provides  the  same  build  functionality  as  a default <u>Makefile</u> <u>or</u> <u>Make.bat</u>, and
              provides the following additional build pipelines:

              <u>latexpdf</u>
                     Build LaTeX files and run them through  <b>pdflatex</b>,  or  as  per  <u>latex_engine</u>  setting.   If
                     <u>language</u> is set to <b>'ja'</b>, will use automatically the <b>platex/dvipdfmx</b> latex to PDF pipeline.

              <u>info</u>   Build Texinfo files and run them through <b>makeinfo</b>.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 The default output directory locations when using <u>make-mode</u> differ from the defaults when using
                 <u>-b</u>.

                 • doctrees are saved to <b>&lt;outputdir&gt;/doctrees</b>

                 • output files are saved to <b>&lt;outputdir&gt;/&lt;builder</b> <b>name&gt;</b>

              Added in version 1.2.1.

       <b>-b</b> <b>buildername,</b> <b>--builder</b> <b>buildername</b>
              Selects a builder.

              See  <u>Builders</u>  for  a  list  of  all  of Sphinx's built-in builders.  Extensions can add their own
              builders.

              Changed in version 7.3: Add <b>--builder</b> long option.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--write-all</b>
              If given, always write all output files. The default is to only write output  files  for  new  and
              changed source files. (This may not apply to all builders.)

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This  option does not re-read source files.  To read and re-process every file, use <u>--fresh-env</u>
                 instead.

              Changed in version 7.3: Add <b>--write-all</b> long option.

       <b>-E,</b> <b>--fresh-env</b>
              Don't use a saved <u>environment</u>  (the  structure  caching  all  cross-references),  but  rebuild  it
              completely.  The default is to only read and parse source files that are new or have changed since
              the last run.

              Changed in version 7.3: Add <b>--fresh-env</b> long option.

       <b>-t</b> <b>tag,</b> <b>--tag</b> <b>tag</b>
              Define  the  tag  <u>tag</u>.   This  is  relevant for <u>only</u> directives that include their content only if
              certain tags are set.  See <u>including</u> <u>content</u> <u>based</u> <u>on</u> <u>tags</u> for further detail.

              Added in version 0.6.

              Changed in version 7.3: Add <b>--tag</b> long option.

       <b>-d</b> <b>path,</b> <b>--doctree-dir</b> <b>path</b>
              Since Sphinx has to read and parse all source files before it can write an output file, the parsed
              source files are cached as "doctree pickles".  Normally, these files are put in a directory called
              <b>.doctrees</b> under the build directory; with this option you can select a different  cache  directory
              (the doctrees can be shared between all builders).

              Changed in version 7.3: Add <b>--doctree-dir</b> long option.

       <b>-j</b> <b>N,</b> <b>--jobs</b> <b>N</b>
              Distribute  the  build  over  <u>N</u> processes in parallel, to make building on multiprocessor machines
              more effective.  This feature only works on systems supporting "fork". Windows is  not  supported.
              Note  that  not all parts and not all builders of Sphinx can be parallelized.  If <b>auto</b> argument is
              given, Sphinx uses the number of CPUs as <u>N</u>. Defaults to 1.

              Added in version 1.2: This option should be considered <u>experimental</u>.

              Changed in version 1.7: Support <b>auto</b> argument.

              Changed in version 6.2: Add <b>--jobs</b> long option.

       <b>-c</b> <b>path,</b> <b>--config-dir</b> <b>path</b>
              Don't look for the <b>conf.py</b> in the source directory, but  use  the  given  configuration  directory
              instead.  Note that various other files and paths given by configuration values are expected to be
              relative to the configuration directory, so they will have to be present at this location too.

              Added in version 0.3.

              Changed in version 7.3: Add <b>--config-dir</b> long option.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--isolated</b>
              Don't look for a configuration file; only take options via the <u>--define</u> option.

              Added in version 0.5.

              Changed in version 7.3: Add <b>--isolated</b> long option.

       <b>-D</b> <b>setting=value,</b> <b>--define</b> <b>setting=value</b>
              Override  a configuration value set in the <b>conf.py</b> file.  The value must be a number, string, list
              or dictionary value.

              For lists, you can separate elements with a comma like this: <b>-D</b> <b>html_theme_path=path1,path2</b>.

              For   dictionary   values,   supply    the    setting    name    and    key    like    this:    <b>-D</b>
              <b>latex_elements.docclass=scrartcl</b>.

              For boolean values, use <b>0</b> or <b>1</b> as the value.

              Changed in version 0.6: The value can now be a dictionary value.

              Changed in version 1.3: The value can now also be a list value.

              Changed in version 7.3: Add <b>--define</b> long option.

       <b>-A</b> <b>name=value,</b> <b>--html-define</b> <b>name=value</b>
              Make the <u>name</u> assigned to <u>value</u> in the HTML templates.

              Added in version 0.5.

              Changed in version 7.3: Add <b>--html-define</b> long option.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--nitpicky</b>
              Run  in  nitpicky  mode.   Currently, this generates warnings for all missing references.  See the
              config value <u>nitpick_ignore</u> for a way to exclude some references as "known missing".

              Changed in version 7.3: Add <b>--nitpicky</b> long option.

       <b>-N,</b> <b>--no-color</b>
              Do not emit colored output.

              Changed in version 1.6: Add <b>--no-color</b> long option.

       <b>--color</b>
              Emit colored output. Auto-detected by default.

              Added in version 1.6.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Increase verbosity (log-level).  This option can be given up to three  times  to  get  more  debug
              logging output.  It implies <u>-T</u>.

              Added in version 1.2.

              Changed in version 7.3: Add <b>--verbose</b> long option.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Do not output anything on standard output, only write warnings and errors to standard error.

              Changed in version 7.3: Add <b>--quiet</b> long option.

       <b>-Q,</b> <b>--silent</b>
              Do  not  output  anything  on standard output, also suppress warnings.  Only errors are written to
              standard error.

              Changed in version 7.3: Add <b>--silent</b> long option.

       <b>-w</b> <b>file,</b> <b>--warning-file</b> <b>file</b>
              Write warnings (and errors) to the given file, in addition to standard error.

              Changed in version 7.3: ANSI control sequences are stripped when writing to <u>file</u>.

              Changed in version 7.3: Add <b>--warning-file</b> long option.

       <b>-W,</b> <b>--fail-on-warning</b>
              Turn warnings into errors.  This means that <b>sphinx-build</b> exits with exit status 1 if any  warnings
              are generated during the build.

              Changed in version 7.3: Add <b>--fail-on-warning</b> long option.

              Changed  in  version  8.1: <b>sphinx-build</b> no longer exits on the first warning, but instead runs the
              entire build and exits with exit status 1 if any warnings  were  generated.   This  behaviour  was
              previously enabled with <u>--keep-going</u>.

       <b>--keep-going</b>
              From  Sphinx 8.1, <b>--keep-going</b> is always enabled.  Previously, it was only applicable whilst using
              <u>--fail-on-warning</u>, which by default exited <b>sphinx-build</b> on the first warning.  Using  <b>--keep-going</b>
              runs <b>!sphinx-build</b> to completion and exits with exit status 1 if errors are encountered.

              Added in version 1.8.

              Changed  in version 8.1: <b>sphinx-build</b> no longer exits on the first warning, meaning that in effect
              <b>--fail-on-warning</b> is always enabled.  The option is retained for compatibility, but may be removed
              at some later date.

       <b>-T,</b> <b>--show-traceback</b>
              Display the full traceback when an unhandled exception  occurs.   Otherwise,  only  a  summary  is
              displayed and the traceback information is saved to a file for further analysis.

              Added in version 1.2.

              Changed in version 7.3: Add <b>--show-traceback</b> long option.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--pdb</b>
              (Useful for debugging only.)  Run the Python debugger, <u>pdb</u>, if an unhandled exception occurs while
              building.

              Changed in version 7.3: Add <b>--pdb</b> long option.

       <b>--exception-on-warning</b>
              Raise  an exception when a warning is emitted during the build.  This can be useful in combination
              with <u>--pdb</u> to debug warnings.

              Added in version 8.1.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Display usage summary or Sphinx version.

              Added in version 1.2.

       You can also give one or more filenames on the command line  after  the  source  and  build  directories.
       Sphinx will then try to build only these output files (and their dependencies).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>sphinx-build</b> refers following environment variables:

       <b>MAKE</b>   A path to make command.  A command name is also allowed.  <b>sphinx-build</b> uses it to invoke sub-build
              process on make-mode.

       Makefile Options

       The  <b>Makefile</b>  and  <b>make.bat</b> files created by <b>sphinx-quickstart</b> usually run <b>sphinx-build</b> only with the <u>-b</u>
       and <u>-d</u> options.  However, they support the following variables to customize behavior:

       <b>PAPER</b>  This sets the  <b>'papersize'</b>  key  of  <u>latex_elements</u>:  i.e.  <b>PAPER=a4</b>  sets  it  to  <b>'a4paper'</b>  and
              <b>PAPER=letter</b> to <b>'letterpaper'</b>.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Usage  of this environment variable got broken at Sphinx 1.5 as <b>a4</b> or <b>letter</b> ended up as option
                 to LaTeX document in place of the needed <b>a4paper</b>, resp. <b>letterpaper</b>.  Fixed at 1.7.7.

       <b>SPHINXBUILD</b>
              The command to use instead of <b>sphinx-build</b>.

       <b>BUILDDIR</b>
              The build directory to use instead of the one chosen in <b>sphinx-quickstart</b>.

       <b>SPHINXOPTS</b>
              Additional options for <b>sphinx-build</b>. These options can also be set via  the  shortcut  variable  <b>O</b>
              (capital 'o').

       <b>NO_COLOR</b>
              When  set  (regardless  of  value),  <b>sphinx-build</b>  will not use color in terminal output. <b>NO_COLOR</b>
              takes precedence over <b>FORCE_COLOR</b>. See <u>no-color.org</u> for other libraries supporting this  community
              standard.

              Added in version 4.5.0.

       <b>FORCE_COLOR</b>
              When  set  (regardless  of  value), <b>sphinx-build</b> will use color in terminal output. <b>NO_COLOR</b> takes
              precedence over <b>FORCE_COLOR</b>.

              Added in version 4.5.0.

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATION</b> <b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       If any deprecation warning like <b>RemovedInSphinxXXXWarning</b> are displayed when building a user's  document,
       some  Sphinx  extension  is  using  deprecated  features. In that case, please report it to author of the
       extension.

       To disable the deprecation warnings, please set <b>PYTHONWARNINGS=</b> environment variable to your environment.
       For example:

       • <b>PYTHONWARNINGS=</b> <b>make</b> <b>html</b> (Linux/Mac)

       • <b>export</b> <b>PYTHONWARNINGS=</b> and do <b>make</b> <b>html</b> (Linux/Mac)

       • <b>set</b> <b>PYTHONWARNINGS=</b> and do <b>make</b> <b>html</b> (Windows)

       • modify your Makefile/make.bat and set the environment variable
