</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Network Audio System - a portable, network-transparent audio system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       The  Network  Audio System service is a network-transparent system developed at Network Computing Devices
       for playing, recording, and manipulating audio data over a network.  It uses the client/server  model  to
       separate  application  code  from  the software drivers needed to control specific audio input and output
       devices.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Network Audio System service provides applications with the ability to send and  receive  audio  data
       such  as  voice,  sound  effects,  and music in a network environment.  A audio server inside the desktop
       terminal or personal computer controls the various input and output devices in response to messages  sent
       from client programs running on other hosts.

       A  variety  of utility programs are provided that can be used to play or record audio using shell scripts
       or command-line procedures.  More ambitious applications can communicate directly with the  audio  server
       using a C-language programming library.

       The  Network  Audio  System  service  supports  a variety of the common formats used to store sound data.
       Audio inputs and outputs can run at a any of a range of sampling rates.  The audio  server  automatically
       converts all data to the designed format or rate.

       Streams  of  data  from multiple inputs can be mixed together and directed to any attached output device.
       Sounds that are used many times can be stored in the server so that they do not need  to  be  transmitted
       over  the  network each time they are played.  Furthermore, inputs can be hooked directly to outputs (for
       example, a CD player can be connected to a set of speakers) so that data can be played without  requiring
       any client intervention or network traffic.

</pre><h4><b>AUDIO</b> <b>SERVER</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       Each  audio  server  has a name that is used by applications in establishing a connection.  The format of
       the name depends upon the type of network being used.  In TCP/IP environments, audio  server  names  look
       like:

                                                 tcp/<u>hostname</u>:<u>portnum</u>

       where  <u>hostname</u>  is  the name or numeric IP address of the desktop machine to be contacted and <u>portnum</u> is
       the port number on which the server is  listening.   If  the  ``tcp/''  prefix  is  not  given,  8000  is
       automatically  added  to  <u>portnum</u>  so  that  the audio server name is compatible with the X Window System
       display name.

       In DECnet environments, audio server names look like:

                                                 decnet/<u>nodename</u>::<u>num</u>

       where <u>nodename</u> is the name or numeric DECnet address of the desktop machine to be contacted  and  <u>num</u>  is
       the  DECnet  task AUDIO$<u>num</u>.  If the ``decnet/'' prefix is omitted, it is automatically added so that the
       audio server name is compatible with the X Window System display name.

       Most audio utilities accept a command line argument <u>-audio</u> <u>servername</u> for specifying the audio server  to
       be contacted.

           % auinfo -audio tcp/ncdunit:8000

       If  no server is specified on the command line, the AUDIOSERVER environment variable is checked to see if
       a name has been stored there.  Otherwise, the DISPLAY  environment  variable  used  by  X  Window  System
       applications is checked and the corresponding audio server is used.

</pre><h4><b>SAMPLE</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b></h4><pre>
       Several sample programs that use the Network Audio System service are provided by NCD:

       <b>auplay</b>  This  program simply plays the files listed on its command line.  It is typically used from shell
               scripts, command-line procedures, or other programs that just need to ``dump'' sound data to  the
               audio server.

       <b>audemo</b>  This  program  allows the user to select and play pre-recorded sound files or to record new sound
               files.  It provides a simple control panel for dynamically changing the volume while a  sound  is
               being played and for aborting a sound.

       <b>audial</b>  This program generates North American telephone touch tones correspond to a given string.  <u>audial</u>
               can also recognize touch tones and produce the corresponding string.

       <b>autool</b>  This  program  is  compatible  with  the  Sun  <u>audiotool</u>  program  and  is typically used to play
               prerecorded sound files.  Unlike <u>auplay</u> it provides a graphical interface to allow  the  user  to
               replay or cancel the data.

       <b>auinfo</b>  This program lists information describing the capabilities of an audio server.

       <b>auctl</b>   This program can be used to change various device parameters.

       <b>auscope</b> This  program is an audio protocol filter that can be used to view the network packets being sent
               between an application and an audio server.

       <b>aupanel</b> This program provides an X-based window-oriented  interface  allowing  the  user  to  adjust  the
               attributes of the devices provided by the Network Audio System service.

       <b>auedit</b>  This program provides an X-based window-oriented interface allowing the user to edit audio files.

       <b>auconvert</b>
               This program allows the user to perform various conversion operations on sound files.

       <b>auphone</b> This  program  provides  an  X-based  window-oriented  interface allowing two-way real time voice
               communication between two audio servers.

       <b>aurecord</b>
               This program is used to record audio data from an audio server into a file.

       <b>auwave</b>  This program provides an X-based window-oriented interface  demonstrating  the  use  of  waveform
               elements.

</pre><h4><b>AUDIO</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  audio  programming  library  and  utility programs can be used to read and write files in any of the
       following file formats:

       <b>Sun/NeXT</b>
              These files typically have a '.au' or '.snd' extension.  They are usually produced by Sun or  NeXT
              workstations.

       <b>Creative</b> <b>Labs</b>
              These files typically have a '.voc' extension.  They are usually produced by by Soundblaster audio
              cards on IBM PC compatible computers.

       <b>Microsoft</b> <b>WAVE</b>
              These  files  typically  have  a '.wav' extension.  They are usually produced by IBM PC compatible
              computers.

       <b>AIFF</b>
              These files typically have an '.aiff' or '.aif' extension.   They  are  usually  produced  by  SGI
              workstations or Apple computers.

       <b>Amiga</b> <b>IFF/8SVX</b>
              These files typically have an '.iff' extension.

       Due  to the nature of the file formats, only the Sun/NeXT file format can be piped through standard input
       and/or standard output.  The convention for specifying standard input or standard  output  is  to  use  a
       hyphen ("-") as the file name.

</pre><h4><b>PROGRAMMING</b></h4><pre>
       Application  developers  may  create  their  own audio clients using the Network Audio System programming
       library.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables are used by Network Audio System programs:

       <b>AUDIOSERVER</b>
               This specifies the name of default audio server to contact if no name is explicitly given on  the
               command line.

       <b>DISPLAY</b> This  specifies  the  name  of  an  X Window System display that should be assumed to also have a
               corresponding Network Audio System server.
