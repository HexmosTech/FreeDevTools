</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       audemo - Network Audio System record and play demo

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>audemo</b> [<b>-audio</b> <u>servername</u>] [<b>-toolkitoption</b> <b>...</b>]  [<u>directory</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>audemo</u> provides an X-based window-oriented user interface to the Network Audio System service.  It allows
       the  user to play pre-recorded sound files, record new sound files and to manipulate Network Audio System
       buckets.

</pre><h4><b>AUDEMO</b> <b>AND</b> <b>THE</b> <b>ATHENA</b> <b>WIDGET</b> <b>SET</b></h4><pre>
       <u>audemo</u> uses the X Toolkit Intrinsics and the Athena Widget Set.  For more  information,  see  the  Athena
       Widget Set documentation.

</pre><h4><b>SCREEN</b> <b>LAYOUT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>audemo</u> starts out with a single window divided into several areas:

       <b>o</b>   A collection of command buttons.

       <b>o</b>   A left and right level meter.

       <b>o</b>   A volume indicator and control slider.

       <b>o</b>   An information window.

       <b>o</b>   An editable field containing the directory to be searched for sound files.

       <b>o</b>   An editable field containing a list of sound files to search for.

       <b>o</b>   A window containing the list of sound files that may be selected for playing or loading into buckets.

</pre><h4><b>PLAYING</b> <b>A</b> <b>SOUND</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       To play a sound file you must first select it from the list of files in the file window.  You can control
       which files are listed in this window by editing the <u>Directory</u> and/or <u>Template</u> fields and clicking on the
       <u>Rescan</u>  button.   To  select  a file, single-click on the filename.  This will highlight the filename and
       display information about the file in the information window.  The information displayed includes:

       <b>Filename</b>
           The full pathname of the file.

       <b>File</b> <b>Format</b>
           The file format of the audio file.

       <b>Data</b> <b>Format</b>
           The encoding format of the audio data.

       <b>Tracks</b>
           The number of tracks of audio data.

       <b>Frequency</b>
           The frequency at which the audio data was sampled.

       <b>Duration</b>
           The duration of the audio data in seconds.

       <b>Text</b>
           Any text information stored in the file.

       Once the file has been selected, you can start it playing by clicking on  the  <u>Play</u>  command  button.   A
       shortcut  for playing a file is to double-click on the file name.  This will select the file and start it
       playing.  When a file is playing, the <u>Play</u> command button is highlighted.  To stop the playing of a file,
       click on the highlighted <u>Play</u> button.  To enable the left and right level  meters,  click  on  the  <u>Meter</u>
       button  before starting to play the file.  To disable the left and right level meters, click again on the
       highlighted <u>Meter</u> button.  To adjust the volume level, use the volume slider.

</pre><h4><b>RECORDING</b> <b>TO</b> <b>A</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       <u>audemo</u> can record sound files in any supported file and data format.  To record a  sound  file  you  must
       first  bring  up the record window by clicking on the <u>Record</u> command button.  This will bring up a window
       containing the following fields and controls:

       <b>Filename</b>
           The name of the file you wish to create.  Unless a path is specified here, the file will  be  created
           in the current directory.

       <b>File</b> <b>Format</b>
           A menu of file formats.

       <b>Data</b> <b>Format</b>
           A  menu  of  data  formats.   Note that each file format does not necessarily support all of the data
           formats listed.

       <b>Max</b> <b>Duration</b>
           See <b>RECORDING</b> <b>TO</b> <b>A</b> <b>BUCKET</b>.

       <b>Read</b> <b>Only</b>
           See <b>RECORDING</b> <b>TO</b> <b>A</b> <b>BUCKET</b>.

       <b>Frequency</b>
           The sampling rate (in hertz) for the recording.  Higher sampling rates yield better quality sound but
           take up more disk and memory space.  Common sampling rates are 8000  (good  for  voice  annotations),
           11000, 22000, and 44000.

       <b>Mic(rophone)</b>
           This  button  tells  the  audio  server  if you've got a microphone attached to the audio input jack.
           Clicking this button will highlight it and cause the audio server to boost the input gain to a  level
           suitable for recording with a microphone.

       <b>Comment</b>
           Text (such as a description) you wish to put into the audio file.

       <b>Gain</b>
           This slider is used to adjust the recording gain level.

       <b>Record</b>
           This button starts or stops the recording.

       <b>Monitor</b>
           This button enables or disables monitoring.

       <b>New</b> <b>Bucket</b>
           See <b>RECORDING</b> <b>TO</b> <b>A</b> <b>BUCKET</b>.

       <b>Dismiss</b>
           This button stops recording and monitoring and closes the record window.

       Once  you  have selected the filename, file and data formats, frequency, mic level, comment and gain, you
       are ready to record.  To listen in on the audio that will be  recorded  you  can  click  on  the  <u>Monitor</u>
       button.   This  will direct all the audio received from the audio input jack to be played on the speaker.
       When you're ready to record, click on the <u>Record</u> button.  All the audio received  from  the  audio  input
       jack  will  now  be  recorded  into  the file.  The recording will continue until you click on the <u>Record</u>
       button again or click on the <u>Dismiss</u> button.  <b>NOTE:</b> Audio data can accumulate very rapidly, especially at
       high sampling rates, resulting in large files.

</pre><h4><b>BUCKETS</b></h4><pre>
       The Network Audio System service provides the capability to create server resident sound  objects  called
       <u>buckets</u>.  <u>audemo</u> allows the user to create <u>buckets</u>, record into them, play from them, load them with data
       from  a file and dump their contents into a file.  Note that buckets created by <u>audemo</u> are destroyed when
       <u>audemo</u> is terminated.  These options are available when you bring up the buckets window  by  clicking  on
       the <u>Buckets</u> button in the main window.  The buckets windows is divided into two areas:

       <b>o</b>   A collection of command buttons.

       <b>o</b>   A table of buckets currently accessible.  This table contains the following columns:

           <b>Description</b>
               The text description.

           <b>Duration</b>
               The duration of the audio data in seconds.

           <b>Tracks</b>
               The number of tracks of audio data.

           <b>Frequency</b>
               The frequency at which the audio data was sampled.

           <b>Format</b>
               A code letter indicating the encoding format of the audio data.  A key to the format code letters
               can be displayed by clicking on the <u>Format</u> <u>Key</u> button.

           <b>Access</b>
               A combination of code letters indicating the access mode of the bucket.  A key to the access code
               letters can be displayed by clicking on the <u>Access</u> <u>Key</u> button.

</pre><h4><b>CREATING</b> <b>A</b> <b>BUCKET</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>A</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       To  create  a bucket from from an audio data file, select the filename from the list of files in the file
       window then click the <u>Load</u> button in the buckets window.  The first line of the buckets table should  now
       contain the information about the newly created bucket.

</pre><h4><b>PLAYING</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>A</b> <b>BUCKET</b></h4><pre>
       To  play  a  bucket,  select  the  bucket you wish to play by clicking on it's information in the buckets
       table.  The entry you click on should be highlighted.  Then click on  the  <u>Play</u>  button  in  the  buckets
       window.   A  shortcut  for playing from a bucket is to double-click on the bucket information.  This will
       select the bucket and start playing from it.  To stop the playing of a bucket, click on  the  highlighted
       <u>Play</u>  button  in the buckets window.  The level meters and volume level can be controlled in the same way
       as when playing from a file.

</pre><h4><b>RECORDING</b> <b>TO</b> <b>A</b> <b>BUCKET</b></h4><pre>
       To record into a new bucket, click on the <u>Record</u> button in the buckets window.  This will  bring  up  the
       record  window.   This  record  window  is  the  same as the one used for recording to files.  Instead of
       specifying a filename, in the <u>Max</u> <u>Duration</u> field, enter the maximum duration (in seconds)  of  data  that
       the  bucket  is  to  hold.  Clicking on the <u>Read</u> <u>Only</u> button will prevent other applications from writing
       into or destroying the bucket.  The frequency, mic level, format and comment are used in the same way  as
       when  recording  to  files.   Once all of the fields are set appropriately, click the <u>New</u> <u>Buckett</u> button.
       This will create a new bucket according to the specifications given.  The first line of the buckets table
       should now contain the information about the newly created bucket.  To begin recording into  the  bucket,
       select  the bucket by clicking on it's information in the buckets table.  Then click the <u>Record</u> button in
       the record window.  All the audio received from the audio input  jack  will  now  be  recorded  into  the
       bucket.   The recording will continue until you click on the <u>Record</u> button again, click on the <u>Dismiss</u> or
       the bucket is filled.  The <u>Gain</u> slider and the <u>Monitor</u> button operate the same as  when  recording  to  a
       file.

</pre><h4><b>SAVING</b> <b>A</b> <b>BUCKET</b> <b>TO</b> <b>A</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       To  save a bucket to a file, first select the bucket by clicking on its information in the buckets table.
       Then click on the <u>Save</u> button in the buckets window.  A dialog box will pop up prompting you for the name
       of the file in which to save the bucket data, and the file format.  The data format used will be that  of
       the  bucket.   Note that each file format may only support selected data formats.  If no path is given in
       the filename, the file will be created in the current directory.  Clicking on <u>Ok</u> or pressing  the  <b>RETURN</b>
       key will cause the file to be created and the data from the bucket to be written to the file.

</pre><h4><b>DELETING</b> <b>A</b> <b>BUCKET</b></h4><pre>
       To  delete  a bucket, first select the bucket by clicking on it's information in the buckets table.  Then
       click on the <u>Delete</u> button in the buckets window.  If the <u>audemo</u> has the appropriate  access  permissions
       for the bucket, the bucket will be deleted and it's information will be removed from the bucket table.

</pre><h4><b>EXITING</b> <b>AUDEMO</b></h4><pre>
       Clicking  on  the <u>Quit</u> button will cause <u>audemo</u> to exit, stopping any playing or recording operations and
       destroying any buckets that were created.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-audio</b> <u>servername</u>
               This option specifies the Network Audio System server to which <u>audemo</u> should connect.

       <u>directory</u>
               The directory name that <u>audemo</u> will use to  build  the  list  of  selectable  file  names.   When
               <u>directory</u> is not specified on the command line, the current working directory is used.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  following  example,  in a <u>TCP/IP</u> network, <u>mcxterm</u> is the name of the desktop machine running the
       audio server.  The default port is <u>8000</u> and sound files are located in <u><a href="file:~/snd">~/snd</a></u>:

              audemo -audio tcp/mcxterm:8000 <a href="file:~/snd">~/snd</a>

       In the following example, the shortened form of the audio server name is used and sound  files  from  the
       current working directory will be used:

              audemo -audio mcxterm:0

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       In  addition  to the standard toolkit environment variables, the following environment variables are used
       by <u>audemo</u>:

       <b>AUDIOSERVER</b>
               This variable specifies the default audio server to contact if <u>-audio</u> is  not  specified  on  the
               command  line.   If this variable is not set and the <u>-audio</u> is not specified on the command line,
               <u>audemo</u> will attempt to connect to the audio server running on the X Window System display.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Warning: audemo is the xterm of the Network Audio System.  It was written to test features as the Network
       Audio System was being developed.  It was also the author's first Xt program.  Consequently, it's  pretty
       ugly and should be completely re-written from scratch.
