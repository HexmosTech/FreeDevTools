</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>passt</b> - Unprivileged user-mode network connectivity for virtual machines
       <b>pasta</b> - Unprivileged user-mode network connectivity for network namespaces

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>passt</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]...
       <b>pasta</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>COMMAND</u> [<u>ARG</u>]...]
       <b>pasta</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... <u>PID</u>
       <b>pasta</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... <b>--netns</b> [<u>PATH</u>|<u>NAME</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>passt</b>
       <b>passt</b>  (<u>P</u>lug  <u>A</u>  <u>S</u>imple  <u>S</u>ocket  <u>T</u>ransport)  provides  full, quasi-native network connectivity to virtual
       machines in user-mode without requiring any capabilities or privileges.

       The data plane implements a translation layer between a Layer-2  virtual  network  interface  and  native
       Layer-4  (TCP, UDP, ping) sockets on the host, giving the illusion that application processes residing on
       the guest are running on the local host, from a networking perspective.

       Built-in ARP, DHCP, NDP, and DHCPv6 implementations are designed to provide  the  guest  with  a  network
       configuration  that  tightly resembles the host native configuration. With the default options, guest and
       host share IP addresses, routes, and port bindings.

       Port forwarding and translation allow networking services running in the guest to be reachable from  both
       local and remote hosts.

       Unlike  <b><a href="../man1/slirp4netns.1.html">slirp4netns</a></b>(1),  <b>passt</b>  doesn't  implement  a  full  TCP  stack: the TCP translation layer has no
       stateful data buffering and operates by reflecting one  peer's  observed  parameters  (congestion  window
       size, acknowledged data, etc.)  to the corresponding peer.

       Currently,  the  only  supported  hypervisor  is  <b><a href="../man1/qemu.1.html">qemu</a></b>(1),  connecting to <b>passt</b> by means of a UNIX domain
       socket. This is supported starting from qemu 7.2. For older qemu versions, see the <b><a href="../man1/qrap.1.html">qrap</a></b>(1) wrapper.

   <b>pasta</b>
       <b>pasta</b> (<u>P</u>ack <u>A</u> <u>S</u>ubtle <u>T</u>ap <u>A</u>bstraction) provides equivalent functionality to network namespaces, as the one
       offered by <b>passt</b> for virtual machines.

       If PID or --netns are given, <b>pasta</b> associates to an existing user and network namespace. Otherwise, <b>pasta</b>
       creates a new user and network namespace, and spawns the given command or a  default  shell  within  this
       context. A <u>tap</u> device within the network namespace is created to provide network connectivity.

       For  local TCP and UDP traffic only, <b>pasta</b> also implements a bypass path directly mapping Layer-4 sockets
       between <u>init</u> and target namespaces, for performance reasons.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Unless otherwise noted below, <b>if</b> <b>conflicting</b> <b>or</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>options</b> <b>are</b> <b>given,</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> <b>takes</b> <b>effect.</b>

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
              Be verbose, don't log to the system logger.

       <b>--trace</b>
              Be extra verbose, show single packets. Implies <b>--debug</b>.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Don't print informational messages.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--foreground</b>
              Don't run in background. This implies that the process is not moved to a  detached  PID  namespace
              after starting, because the PID itself cannot change.  Default is to fork into background.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--stderr</b> <b>(DEPRECATED)</b>
              This option has no effect, and is maintained for compatibility purposes only.

              Note that this configuration option is <b>deprecated</b> and will be removed in a future version.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--log-file</b> <u>PATH</u>
              Log to file <u>PATH</u>, and not to the system logger.

              Specifying  this  option multiple times does <u>not</u> lead to multiple log files: the last given option
              takes effect.

       <b>--log-size</b> <u>SIZE</u>
              Limit log file size to <u>SIZE</u> bytes. When the log file  is  full,  make  room  for  new  entries  by
              removing old ones at the beginning. This limit is mandatory.  Default is 1048576 (1 MiB).

       <b>--runas</b> <u>UID</u>|<u>UID:GID</u>|<u>LOGIN</u>|<u>LOGIN:GROUP</u>
              Attempt  to change to given UID and corresponding group if UID is given, or to given UID and given
              GID if both are given. Alternatively, login name, or login name and group name can be passed. This
              requires privileges (either initial effective UID 0 or CAP_SETUID capability) to work.  Default is
              to change to user <u>nobody</u> if started as root.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display a help message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
              Show version and exit.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pcap</b> <u>file</u>
              Capture tap-facing (that is, guest-side or namespace-side) network packets to <u>file</u> in <b>pcap</b> format.

              Specifying this option multiple times does <u>not</u> lead to multiple  capture  files:  the  last  given
              option takes effect.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--pid</b> <u>file</u>
              Write  own PID to <u>file</u> once initialisation is done, before forking to background (if configured to
              do so).

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mtu</b> <u>mtu</u>
              Assign <u>mtu</u> via DHCP (option 26) and NDP (option type 5). A zero  value  disables  assignment.   By
              default,  the  advertised MTU is 65520 bytes, that is, the maximum 802.3 MTU minus the length of a
              802.3 header, rounded to 32 bits (IPv4 words).

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--address</b> <u>addr</u>
              Assign IPv4 <u>addr</u> via DHCP (<b>yiaddr</b>), or <u>addr</u> via DHCPv6 (option 5) and an <u>addr</u>-based prefix via NDP
              Router Advertisement (option type 3) for an IPv6 <u>addr</u>.  This option can  be  specified  zero  (for
              defaults)  to  two  times  (once  for  IPv4,  once  for IPv6).  By default, assigned IPv4 and IPv6
              addresses are taken from the host interfaces with  the  first  default  route,  if  any,  for  the
              corresponding  IP  version. If no default routes are available and there is any interface with any
              route for a given IP version, the first of these interfaces will be chosen  instead.  If  no  such
              interface  exists,  the  link-local  address  169.254.2.1  is assigned for IPv4, and no additional
              address will be assigned for IPv6.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--netmask</b> <u>mask</u>
              Assign IPv4 netmask <u>mask</u>, expressed as dot-decimal or number of bits, via  DHCP  (option  1).   By
              default,  the netmask associated to the host address matching the assigned one is used. If there's
              no matching address on the host, the netmask is determined according to  the  CIDR  block  of  the
              assigned address (RFC 4632).

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--mac-addr</b> <u>addr</u>
              Use  source  MAC address <u>addr</u> when communicating to the guest or to the target namespace.  Default
              is the locally administered MAC addresses 9a:55:9a:55:9a:55.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--gateway</b> <u>addr</u>
              Assign IPv4 <u>addr</u> as default gateway via DHCP (option 3), or IPv6 <u>addr</u> as  source  for  NDP  Router
              Advertisement  and DHCPv6 messages.  This option can be specified zero (for defaults) to two times
              (once for IPv4, once for IPv6).  By default, IPv4 and  IPv6  gateways  are  taken  from  the  host
              interface  with  the first default route, if any, for the corresponding IP version. If the default
              route is a multipath one, the gateway is the first nexthop router returned by the kernel which has
              the highest weight in the set of paths. If no default routes are available and there is  just  one
              interface  with any route, that interface will be chosen instead. If no such interface exists, the
              link-local address 169.254.2.2 is used for IPv4, and the link-local address fe80::1  is  used  for
              IPv6.

              Note:  these addresses are also used as source address for packets directed to the guest or to the
              target namespace having a loopback or local source address, to allow mapping of local  traffic  to
              guest and target namespace. See the <b>NOTES</b> below for more details about this mechanism.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--interface</b> <u>name</u>
              Use  host  interface  <u>name</u>  to  derive  addresses  and  routes.   Default is to use the interfaces
              specified  by  <b>--outbound-if4</b>  and  <b>--outbound-if6</b>,  for  IPv4  and  IPv6  addresses  and  routes,
              respectively.

              If  no  interfaces  are  given, the interface with the first default routes for each IP version is
              selected. If no default routes are available and there is just one interface with any route,  that
              interface will be chosen instead. If no such interface exists, host interfaces will be ignored for
              the purposes of assigning addresses and routes, and link-local addresses will be used instead.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--outbound</b> <u>addr</u>
              Use an IPv4 <u>addr</u> as source address for IPv4 outbound TCP connections, UDP flows, ICMP requests, or
              an  IPv6 <u>addr</u> for IPv6 ones, by binding outbound sockets to it.  This option can be specified zero
              (for defaults) to two times (once for IPv4, once for IPv6).  By default,  the  source  address  is
              selected by the routing tables.

       <b>--outbound-if4</b> <u>name</u>
              Bind  IPv4 outbound sockets to host interface <u>name</u>, and, unless another interface is specified via
              <b>-i</b>, <b>--interface</b>, use this interface to derive IPv4 addresses and routes.

              By default, the interface given by the default  route  is  selected.  If  no  default  routes  are
              available  and  there is just one interface with any route, that interface will be chosen instead.
              If no such interface exists, outbound sockets will not be bound to any specific interface.

       <b>--outbound-if6</b> <u>name</u>
              Bind IPv6 outbound sockets to host interface <u>name</u>, and, unless another interface is specified  via
              <b>-i</b>, <b>--interface</b>, use this interface to derive IPv6 addresses and routes.

              By  default,  the  interface  given  by  the  default  route is selected. If no default routes are
              available and there is just one interface with any route, that interface will be  chosen  instead.
              If no such interface exists, outbound sockets will not be bound to any specific interface.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--dns</b> <u>addr</u>
              Instruct  the  guest  (via  DHCP,  DHVPv6  or  NDP) to use <u>addr</u> (IPv4 or IPv6) as a nameserver, as
              configured  (see  options  <b>--no-dhcp-dns</b>,  <b>--dhcp-dns</b>)   instead   of   reading   addresses   from
              <u><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></u>.  This option can be specified multiple times.  Specifying <b>-D</b> <b>none</b> disables usage
              of  DNS  addresses altogether.  Unlike addresses from <u><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></u>, <u>addr</u> is given to the guest
              without remapping.  For example  <b>--dns</b>  <b>127.0.0.1</b>  will  instruct  the  guest  to  use  itself  as
              nameserver, not the host.

       <b>--dns-forward</b> <u>addr</u>
              Map  <u>addr</u>  (IPv4 or IPv6) as seen from guest or namespace to the nameserver (with corresponding IP
              version) specified by the <b>--dns-host</b> option. Maps only UDP and TCP traffic to port 53 or port 853.
              Replies are translated back with a reverse mapping.  This option can  be  specified  zero  to  two
              times (once for IPv4, once for IPv6).

       <b>--dns-host</b> <u>addr</u>
              Configure  the  host nameserver which guest or namespace queries to the <b>--dns-forward</b> address will
              be redirected to. This option can be specified zero to two times (once for IPv4, once  for  IPv6).
              By default, the first nameserver from the host's <u><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></u>.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--search</b> <u>list</u>
              Use  space-separated  <u>list</u>  for  DHCP,  DHCPv6,  and NDP purposes, instead of reading entries from
              <u><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></u>. See options <b>--no-dhcp-search</b> and <b>--dhcp-search</b>. <b>--search</b> <b>none</b> disables  the  DNS
              domain  search  list altogether (if you need to search a domain called "none" you can use <b>--search</b>
              <b>none.</b>).

       <b>--no-dhcp-dns</b>
              In <u>passt</u> mode, do not assign IPv4 addresses via DHCP (option 23) or IPv6 addresses via NDP  Router
              Advertisement  (option  type  25)  and  DHCPv6  (option 23) as DNS resolvers.  By default, all the
              configured addresses are passed.

       <b>--dhcp-dns</b>
              In <u>pasta</u> mode, assign IPv4 addresses via DHCP  (option  23)  or  IPv6  addresses  via  NDP  Router
              Advertisement  (option  type  25) and DHCPv6 (option 23) as DNS resolvers.  By default, configured
              addresses, if any, are not passed.

       <b>--no-dhcp-search</b>
              In <u>passt</u> mode, do not send the DNS domain search list addresses via DHCP  (option  119),  via  NDP
              Router  Advertisement  (option type 31) and DHCPv6 (option 24).  By default, the DNS domain search
              list resulting from configuration is passed.

       <b>--dhcp-search</b>
              In <u>pasta</u> mode, send the DNS domain search list addresses via DHCP (option  119),  via  NDP  Router
              Advertisement  (option  type  31)  and DHCPv6 (option 24).  By default, the DNS domain search list
              resulting from configuration is not passed.

       <b>--no-tcp</b>
              Disable the TCP protocol handler. No TCP connections will be accepted host-side, and  TCP  packets
              coming from guest or target namespace will be silently dropped.

       <b>--no-udp</b>
              Disable  the UDP protocol handler. No UDP traffic coming from the host side will be forwarded, and
              UDP packets coming from guest or target namespace will be silently dropped.

       <b>--no-icmp</b>
              Disable the ICMP/ICMPv6 echo handler. ICMP and ICMPv6 echo requests coming from  guest  or  target
              namespace will be silently dropped.

       <b>--no-dhcp</b>
              Disable  the  DHCP  server.  DHCP  client  requests  coming from guest or target namespace will be
              silently dropped. Implied if there is no gateway on the selected IPv4 default route.

       <b>--no-ndp</b>
              Disable NDP responses. NDP messages coming from guest or target namespace will be ignored.

       <b>--no-dhcpv6</b>
              Disable the DHCPv6 server. DHCPv6 client requests coming from guest or target  namespace  will  be
              silently dropped.

       <b>--no-ra</b>
              Disable  Router Advertisements. Router Solicitations coming from guest or target namespace will be
              ignored.

       <b>--freebind</b>
              Allow any binding address to be specified for <b>-t</b> and <b>-u</b> options.  Usually binding  addresses  must
              be  addresses currently configured on the host.  With <b>--freebind</b>, the <b>IP_FREEBIND</b> or <b>IPV6_FREEBIND</b>
              socket option is enabled allowing any address  to  be  used.   This  is  typically  used  to  bind
              addresses  which  might  be  configured  on the host in future, at which point the forwarding will
              immediately start operating.

       <b>--map-host-loopback</b> <u>addr</u>
              Translate <u>addr</u> to refer to the host. Packets from the guest to <u>addr</u>  will  be  redirected  to  the
              host.   On  the  host such packets will appear to have both source and destination of 127.0.0.1 or
              ::1.

              If <u>addr</u> is 'none', no address is mapped (this implies <b>--no-map-gw</b>).  Only one IPv4  and  one  IPv6
              address can be translated, if the option is specified multiple times, the last one takes effect.

              Default is to translate the guest's default gateway address, unless <b>--no-map-gw</b> is given, in which
              case no address is mapped.

       <b>--no-map-gw</b>
              Don't remap TCP connections and untracked UDP traffic, with the gateway address as destination, to
              the  host. Implied if there is no gateway on the selected default route, or if there is no default
              route, for any of the enabled address families.

       <b>--map-guest-addr</b> <u>addr</u>
              Translate <u>addr</u> in the guest to be equal to the guest's assigned address on  the  host.   That  is,
              packets from the guest to <u>addr</u> will be redirected to the address assigned to the guest with <b>-a</b>, or
              by  default  the host's global address.  This allows the guest to access services available on the
              host's global address, even though its own address shadows that of the host.

              If <u>addr</u> is 'none', no address is mapped.  Only one IPv4 and one IPv6 address  can  be  translated,
              and if the option is specified multiple times, the last one for each address type takes effect.

              By default, mapping happens as described for the --map-host-loopback option.

       <b>-4</b>, <b>--ipv4-only</b>
              Enable  IPv4-only  operation. IPv6 traffic will be ignored.  By default, IPv6 operation is enabled
              as long as at least an IPv6 route and  an  interface  address  are  configured  on  a  given  host
              interface.

       <b>-6</b>, <b>--ipv6-only</b>
              Enable  IPv6-only  operation. IPv4 traffic will be ignored.  By default, IPv4 operation is enabled
              as long as at least an IPv4 route and  an  interface  address  are  configured  on  a  given  host
              interface.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hostname</b> <u>name</u>
              Hostname to configure the client with.  Send <u>name</u> as DHCP option 12 (hostname).

       <b>--fqdn</b> <u>name</u>
              FQDN to configure the client with.  Send <u>name</u> as Client FQDN: DHCP option 81 and DHCPv6 option 39.

   <b>passt</b>-only options
       <b>-s</b>, <b>--socket-path</b>, <b>--socket</b> <u>path</u>
              Path for UNIX domain socket used by <b><a href="../man1/qemu.1.html">qemu</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/qrap.1.html">qrap</a></b>(1) to connect to <b>passt</b>.  Default is to probe a
              free socket, not accepting connections, starting from <u>/tmp/passt_1.socket</u> to <u>/tmp/passt_64.socket</u>.

       <b>--vhost-user</b>
              Enable vhost-user. The vhost-user command socket is provided by <b>--socket</b>.

       <b>--print-capabilities</b>
              Print back-end capabilities in JSON format, only meaningful for vhost-user mode.

       <b>--repair-path</b> <u>path</u>
              Path for UNIX domain socket used by the <b><a href="../man1/passt-repair.1.html">passt-repair</a></b>(1) helper to connect to <b>passt</b> in order to set
              or  clear  the  TCP_REPAIR  option  on sockets, during migration. <b>--repair-path</b> <b>none</b> disables this
              interface (if you need to specify a socket path called "none" you can prefix the path by <u>./</u>).

              Default, for --vhost-user mode only, is to append <u>.repair</u> to the path chosen  for  the  hypervisor
              UNIX domain socket. No socket is created if not in --vhost-user mode.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--fd</b> <u>FD</u>
              Pass  a  pre-opened, connected socket to <b>passt</b>. Usually the socket is opened in the parent process
              and <b>passt</b> inherits it when run as a child. This allows the parent process to  open  sockets  using
              another address family or requiring special privileges.

              This option implies the behaviour described for --one-off, once this socket is closed.

       <b>-1</b>, <b>--one-off</b>
              Quit  after  handling  a  single client connection, that is, once the client closes the socket, or
              once we get a socket error.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--tcp-ports</b> <u>spec</u>
              Configure TCP port forwarding to guest. <u>spec</u> can be one of:

              <b>none</b>   Don't forward any ports

              <b>all</b>    Forward all unbound, non-ephemeral ports, as permitted by current capabilities.  For low (&lt;
                     1024) ports, see <b>NOTES</b>. No failures are reported for unavailable  ports,  unless  no  ports
                     could be forwarded at all.

              <b>ports</b>  A  comma-separated  list  of  ports, optionally ranged with <u>-</u>, and, optionally, with target
                     ports after <u>:</u>, if they differ. Specific addresses can be bound as well, separated by <u>/</u>, and
                     also, since Linux 5.7, limited to specific interfaces, prefixed by <u>%</u>. Within given  ranges,
                     selected ports and ranges can be excluded by an additional specification prefixed by <u>~</u>.

                     Specifying  excluded  ranges only implies that all other ports are forwarded. In this case,
                     no failures are reported for unavailable ports, unless no ports could be forwarded at all.

                     Examples:

                     -t 22  Forward local port 22 to port 22 on the guest

                     -t 22:23

                            Forward local ports 22 and 25 to ports 22 and 25 on the guest

                     -t 22-80
                            Forward local ports between 22 and 80 to corresponding ports on the guest

                     -t 22-80:32-90
                            Forward local ports between 22 and 80 to ports between 32 and 90 on the guest

                     -t 192.0.2.1/22
                            Forward local port 22, bound to 192.0.2.1, to port 22 on the guest

                     -t 192.0.2.1%eth0/22
                            Forward local port 22, bound to 192.0.2.1 and interface eth0, to port 22

                     -t %eth0/22
                            Forward local port 22, bound to any address on interface eth0, to port 22

                     -t 2000-5000,~3000-3010
                            Forward local ports between 2000 and 5000, except for those between 3000 and 3010

                     -t 192.0.2.1/20-30,~25
                            For the local address 192.0.2.1, forward ports between 20 and 24 and between 26  and
                            30

                     -t ~20000-20010
                            Forward all ports to the guest, except for the range from 20000 to 20010

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--udp-ports</b> <u>spec</u>
              Configure UDP port forwarding to guest. <u>spec</u> is as described for TCP above.

              Note:  unless  overridden,  UDP ports with numbers corresponding to forwarded TCP port numbers are
              forwarded too, without, however, any port translation. IPv6 bound ports  are  also  forwarded  for
              IPv4.

              Default is <b>none</b>.

   <b>pasta</b>-only options
       <b>-I</b>, <b>--ns-ifname</b> <u>name</u>
              Name  of  tap interface to be created in target namespace.  By default, the same interface name as
              the external, routable interface is used.  If no such interface exists, the name <u>tap0</u> will be used
              instead.

              IPv6 bound ports are also forwarded for IPv4.

              Default is <b>auto</b>.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--udp-ports</b> <u>spec</u>
              Configure UDP port forwarding to namespace. <u>spec</u> is as described for TCP above, and  the  list  of
              ports is derived from listening sockets reported by <u><a href="file:/proc/net/udp">/proc/net/udp</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/proc/net/udp6">/proc/net/udp6</a></u>, see <b><a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</a></b>(5).

              Note:  unless  overridden,  UDP ports with numbers corresponding to forwarded TCP port numbers are
              forwarded too, without, however, any port translation.

              IPv6 bound ports are also forwarded for IPv4.

              Default is <b>auto</b>.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--tcp-ns</b> <u>spec</u>
              Configure TCP port forwarding from target namespace to init namespace.  <u>spec</u> is as described above
              for TCP.

              Default is <b>auto</b>.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--udp-ns</b> <u>spec</u>
              Configure UDP port forwarding from target namespace to init namespace.  <u>spec</u> is as described above
              for UDP.

              Default is <b>auto</b>.

       <b>--host-lo-to-ns-lo</b>
              If specified, connections forwarded with <b>-t</b> and <b>-u</b> from the host's loopback address will appear on
              the loopback address in the guest as well.  Without this option such forwarded packets will appear
              to come from the guest's public address.

       <b>--userns</b> <u>spec</u>
              Target user namespace to join, as a path. If PID is given, without this option, the user namespace
              will be the one of the corresponding process.

       <b>--netns</b> <u>spec</u>
              Target network namespace to join, as a path or a name.  A name is treated as with  <b><a href="../man8/ip-netns.8.html">ip-netns</a>(8)</b>  as
              equivalent to a path in <u>/run/netns</u>.

              This option can't be specified with a PID.

       <b>--netns-only</b>
              Join  only  a  target network namespace, not a user namespace, and don't create one for sandboxing
              purposes either. This is implied if PATH or NAME are given without --userns.

       <b>--no-netns-quit</b>
              Do not exit once the target namespace reference is removed.

              Without this option, <b>pasta</b> will terminate  if  the  target  network  namespace  is  bound  to  the
              filesystem,  and the given path is deleted, or if the target network namespace is represented by a
              procfs entry, and that entry is deleted, representing the fact that a process with the  given  PID
              terminated.

       <b>--config-net</b>
              Configure  networking  in the namespace: set up addresses and routes as configured or sourced from
              the host, and bring up the tap interface.

       <b>--no-copy-routes</b> <b>(DEPRECATED)</b>
              With --config-net, do not copy all the routes associated to the interface we derive addresses  and
              routes  from:  set up only the default gateway. Implied by -g, --gateway, for the corresponding IP
              version only.

              Default is to copy all the routing entries from the interface in the outer namespace to the target
              namespace, translating the output interface attribute to the outbound interface in the namespace.

              Note that this configuration option is <b>deprecated</b> and will be removed in a future version.  It  is
              not  expected to be of any use, and it simply reflects a legacy behaviour. If you have any use for
              this, refer to <b>REPORTING</b> <b>BUGS</b> below.

       <b>--no-copy-addrs</b> <b>(DEPRECATED)</b>
              With --config-net, do not copy all the addresses associated to the interface we  derive  addresses
              and  routes  from: set up a single one. Implied by -a, --address, for the corresponding IP version
              only.

              Default is to copy all the addresses, except for link-local ones,  from  the  interface  from  the
              outer namespace to the target namespace.

              Note  that  this configuration option is <b>deprecated</b> and will be removed in a future version. It is
              not expected to be of any use, and it simply reflects a legacy behaviour. If you have any use  for
              this, refer to <b>REPORTING</b> <b>BUGS</b> below.

       <b>--ns-mac-addr</b> <u>addr</u>
              Configure MAC address <u>addr</u> on the tap interface in the namespace.

              Default is to let the tap driver build a pseudorandom hardware address.

       <b>--no-splice</b>
              Disable  the  bypass path for inbound, local traffic. See the section <b>Handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b>

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>with</b> <b>loopback</b> <b>destination</b> <b>and</b> <b>source</b> <b>addresses</b>
       Both <b>passt</b> and <b>pasta</b> can bind on ports with a loopback address (127.0.0.0/8 or  ::1),  depending  on  the
       configuration.  Loopback  destination or source addresses need to be changed before packets are delivered
       to the guest or target namespace: most operating  systems  would  drop  packets  received  with  loopback
       addresses  on  non-loopback  interfaces, and it would also be impossible for guest or target namespace to
       route answers back.

       For convenience, the source address on these packets is translated to the address specified by the <b>--map-</b>
       <b>host-loopback</b> option (with some exceptions in pasta mode, see next section below).  If not specified this
       defaults, somewhat arbitrarily, to the address of default IPv4 or IPv6 gateway (if any) -- this is  known
       to  be  an  existing,  valid  address on the same subnet.  If <b>--no-map-gw</b> or <b>--map-host-loopback</b> <b>none</b> are
       specified this translation is disabled and packets with loopback addresses are simply dropped.

       Loopback destination addresses are translated to the observed external address of  the  guest  or  target
       namespace.  For  IPv6,  the observed link-local address is used if the translated source address is link-
       local, otherwise the observed global address is used. For both IPv4 and IPv6, if no addresses  have  been
       seen yet, the configured addresses will be used instead.

       For  example, if <b>passt</b> or <b>pasta</b> receive a connection from 127.0.0.1, with destination 127.0.0.10, and the
       default IPv4 gateway is 192.0.2.1, while the last observed source address  from  guest  or  namespace  is
       192.0.2.2, this will be translated to a connection from 192.0.2.1 to 192.0.2.2.

       Similarly,  for traffic coming from guest or namespace, packets with destination address corresponding to
       the <b>--map-host-loopback</b> address will have their destination address translated to a loopback address.

       As an exception, traffic identified as DNS, originally directed to the  <b>--map-host-loopback</b>  address,  if
       this address matches a resolver address on the host, is <b>not</b> translated to loopback, but rather handled in
       the  same  way as if specified as --dns-forward address, if no such option was given.  In the common case
       where  the  host  gateway  also  acts  a  resolver,  this  avoids  that  the  host  mapping  shadows  the
       gateway/resolver itself.

   <b>Handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>pasta</b>
       Depending  on  the  configuration,  <b>pasta</b>  can  bind  to local ports in the init namespace, in the target
       namespace, or both, and forward connections and packets to corresponding ports in the other namespace.

       To avoid unnecessary overhead, these connections and packets are not forwarded  through  the  tap  device
       connecting  the  namespaces:  <b>pasta</b>  creates a socket in the destination namespace, with matching Layer-4
       protocol, and uses it to forward local data. For TCP, data is forwarded between  the  originating  socket
       and  the  new  socket using the <b><a href="../man2/splice.2.html">splice</a></b>(2) system call, and for UDP, a pair of <b><a href="../man2/recvmmsg.2.html">recvmmsg</a></b>(2) and <b><a href="../man2/sendmmsg.2.html">sendmmsg</a></b>(2)
       system calls deals with packet transfers.

       Because it's not possible to bind sockets to  foreign  addresses,  this  bypass  only  applies  to  local
       connections  and  traffic.   It also means that the address translation differs slightly from passt mode.
       Connections from loopback to loopback on the host will appear to come from the target namespace's  public
       address  within the guest, unless <b>--host-lo-to-ns-lo</b> is specified, in which case they will appear to come
       from loopback in the namespace as well.  The latter behaviour used to be  the  default,  but  is  usually
       undesirable, since it can unintentionally expose namespace local services to the host.

   <b>Binding</b> <b>to</b> <b>low</b> <b>numbered</b> <b>ports</b> <b>(well-known</b> <b>or</b> <b>system</b> <b>ports,</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>1023)</b>
       If  the  port  forwarding configuration requires binding to ports with numbers lower than 1024, <b>passt</b> and
       <b>pasta</b> will try to bind to them, but will fail, unless, either:

       • the <u>sys.net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start</u> sysctl is set to the number of the lowest  port  <b>passt</b>  and
         <b>pasta</b> need. For example, as root:

              sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=443

         <b>Note</b>: this is the recommended way of enabling <b>passt</b> and <b>pasta</b> to bind to ports with numbers below 1024.

       • or the <u>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</u> Linux capability is granted, see <b><a href="../man5/services.5.html">services</a></b>(5) and <b><a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</a></b>(7).

         This  is,  in  general,  <b>not</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>recommended</b>  <b>way</b>, because <b>passt</b> and <b>pasta</b> might be used as vector to
         effectively use this capability from another process.

         However, if your environment is sufficiently controlled by an  LSM  (Linux  Security  Module)  such  as
         <u>AppArmor</u>,  <u>SELinux</u>,  <u>Smack</u>  or  <u>TOMOYO</u>,  and no other processes can interact in such a way in virtue of
         this, granting this capability to <b>passt</b> and <b>pasta</b> only can effectively  prevent  other  processes  from
         utilising it.

         Note  that this will not work for automatic detection and forwarding of ports with <b>pasta</b>, because <b>pasta</b>
         will relinquish this capability at runtime.

         To grant this capability, you can issue, as root:

              for p in $(which passt passt.avx2); do
                   setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' "${p}"
              done

   <b>ICMP/ICMPv6</b> <b>Echo</b> <b>sockets</b>
       ICMP and ICMPv6 Echo requests coming from guest or target namespace are handled  using  so-called  "ping"
       sockets, introduced in Linux 2.6.30. To preserve the original identifier (see RFC 792, page 14, for ICMP,
       and  RFC  4443,  section  4.1,  for ICMPv6), <b>passt</b> and <b>pasta</b> try to bind these sockets using the observed
       source identifier as "port" -- that corresponds to Echo identifiers for "ping" sockets.

       As <b><a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a></b>(2) failures were seen with particularly restrictive SELinux policies, a fall-back mechanism  maps
       different  identifiers  to  different  sockets,  and  identifiers  in  replies will be mapped back to the
       original identifier of the request. However, if <b><a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a></b>(2) fails and the fall-back mechanism is  used,  echo
       requests will be forwarded with different, albeit unique, identifiers.

       For  ICMP  and  ICMPv6  Echo requests to work, the <u>ping_group_range</u> parameter needs to include the PID of
       <b>passt</b> or <b>pasta</b>, see <b><a href="../man7/icmp.7.html">icmp</a></b>(7).

   <b>pasta</b> <b>and</b> <b>loopback</b> <b>interface</b>
       As <b>pasta</b> connects to an existing namespace, or once it creates a new namespace, it will also ensure  that
       the loopback interface, <u>lo</u>, is brought up. This is needed to bind ports using the loopback address in the
       namespace.

   <b>TCP</b> <b>sending</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <u><b>TCP_INFO</b></u> <b>before</b> <b>Linux</b> <b>5.3</b>
       To  synchronise  the  TCP sending window from host Layer-4 sockets to the TCP parameters announced in TCP
       segments sent over the Layer-2 interface, <b>passt</b> and <b>pasta</b> routinely query the size of the sending  window
       seen by the kernel on the corresponding socket using the <u>TCP_INFO</u> socket option, see <b><a href="../man7/tcp.7.html">tcp</a></b>(7). Before Linux
       5.3,  i.e.  before  Linux kernel commit 8f7baad7f035 ("tcp: Add snd_wnd to TCP_INFO"), the sending window
       (<u>snd_wnd</u> field) is not available.

       If the sending window cannot be queried, it will always be announced as the current sending  buffer  size
       to guest or target namespace. This might affect throughput of TCP connections.

   <b>Local</b> <b>mode</b> <b>for</b> <b>disconnected</b> <b>setups</b>
       If  <b>passt</b>  and  <b>pasta</b>  fail  to  find  a  host  interface  with a configured address, other than loopback
       addresses, they will, obviously, not attempt to source addresses or routes from the host.

       In this case, unless configured otherwise, they will assign the IPv4 link-local  address  169.254.2.1  to
       the  guest  or  target  namespace,  and no IPv6 address. The notion of the guest or target namespace IPv6
       address is derived from the first link-local address observed.

       Default gateways will be assigned as the link-local address 169.254.2.2 for IPv4, and as  the  link-local
       address fe80::1 for IPv6.
