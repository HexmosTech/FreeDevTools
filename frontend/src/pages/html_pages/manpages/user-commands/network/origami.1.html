</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Origami allows you to install, monitor, archive or restore Folding @ Home data on your local machine.  It
       also allows for central deployment, monitoring, archiving, restoration and updating the username and team
       data via the network to ssh-accessible machines.

       Origami supports cron-based scheduling, 32bit or 64bit and network proxy settings.  Install Stanfords
       Folding @ Home client to a single machine or network of machines.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The first argument which does not begin with a hyphen ("-") is considered to be an action that the
       program should perform.  If an action is not specified <b>Origami</b> will display the help output.

       The following actions are available to the local machine:

       <b>install</b> Install  Folding  @ Home to the local machine.  This action will create a dedicated user, storage
               location for Folding @ Home data, startup script and request a work unit.

       <b>deploy</b>  Install Folding @ Home to remote machines as listed in the <a href="file:~/.origamirc">~/.origamirc</a> file.  This  action  will
               create  a  dedicated user, storage location for Folding @ Home data, startup script and request a
               work unit on the remote machine.  SSH access as the root user is required for the deploy action.

       <b>archive</b> Archive Folding @ Home data for the local Folding @ Home  client.   This  action  will  stop  the
               Folding  @  Home client, archive the current progress into a &lt;hostname&gt;-&lt;date&gt;.tar.bz2 format and
               store the data in <a href="file:~/.origami/.">~/.origami/.</a>

       <b>network-archive</b>
               Archive Folding @ Home data on the remote Folding @ Home client as listed  in  the  <a href="file:~/.origamirc.">~/.origamirc.</a>
               This  action  will  stop  the  Folding  @  Home  client,  archive  the  current  progress  into a
               &lt;hostname&gt;-&lt;date&gt;.tar.bz2 format and store the data in <a href="file:~/.origami/.">~/.origami/.</a>

       <b>restore</b> Restore Folding @ Home data on the local machine.  This action will require  previously  archived
               data (as generated by the archive action).
