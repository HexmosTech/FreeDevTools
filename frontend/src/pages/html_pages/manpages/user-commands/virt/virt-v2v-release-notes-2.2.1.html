</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       virt-v2v-release-notes - virt-v2v release notes for 2.2

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These are the release notes for <b>virt-v2v</b> <b>2.2</b>.  This describes the major changes since 2.0.

       Virt-v2v 2.2.0 was released on <b>Tuesday</b> <b>10</b> <b>January</b> <b>2023</b>.

   <b>Security</b>
       When running virt-v2v as root, NBD Unix domain sockets in the v2v directory were openable by any user.
       We now set the directory owner so only qemu can access the sockets.  See:
       https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2066773 (thanks Xiaodai Wang, Dr David Gilbert, Daniel
       Berrangé, Laszlo Ersek).

   <b>New</b> <b>features</b>
       New <b><a href="../man1/virt-v2v-inspector.1.html">virt-v2v-inspector</a></b>(1) tool.  This tool can be used before conversion to collect facts about the
       source guest, such as number of disks, and to estimate the disk space required after conversion.

       Add support for NVMe devices and SATA hard disks when importing from VMware VMX files (Laszlo Ersek).

       Add support for importing to KubeVirt using the new <b>experimental</b> <u>-o</u> <u>kubevirt</u> mode.

       Windows 11 guests are now supported.

       Rocky Linux guest support has been added (Andrey Drobyshev).

   <b>Feature</b> <b>removed</b>
       The <u>-o</u> <u>json</u> mode was removed.  It was intended to be used with KubeVirt but was never actually used
       there.  Use <u>-o</u> <u>kubevirt</u> instead.

   <b>Other</b> <b>fixes</b>
       Fix detection of virtio-socket support in Linux guests (Laszlo Ersek).  In addition, a semi-random guest
       CID is chosen in <u>-o</u> <u>qemu</u> mode, avoiding an error.

       Allow importing OVAs where the user or group name inside the tarball contains a space (Jiří Sléžka).

       Reject guests with snapshots when using -i vmx -it ssh (Laszlo Ersek).

       Improve documentation for the need to enable PasswordAuthentication on the server side when importing
       over SSH (Laszlo Ersek).

       Don't use the deprecated qemu <u>-balloon</u> option.  This caused deprecation warnings with <u>-o</u> <u>qemu</u> mode.  Use
       <u>-device</u> instead.

       Rewrite device mapping in <u>-o</u> <u>qemu</u> mode, removing some strange / non-existent cases like SCSI floppies.
       This should result in more consistent device layout when using this mode (Laszlo Ersek).

       Remove more left over open-vm-tools packages from Linux guests (Tim Kent).

       In <u>-o</u> <u>rhv-upload</u> mode, do not return until the VM has been created (Tomáš Golembiovský).

       Greatly improved vCPU model handling (Laszlo Ersek).

       Document extra permissions needed for non-admin conversion with VMware 7 (Ming Xie).

       QEMU guest agent is now installed unconditionally and where possible a virtio-serial socket is created in
       the guest metadata (Laszlo Ersek).

       In the various RHV output modes, the number of disks is now limited to 23.  RHV doesn't support anything
       greater and would break (Laszlo Ersek).

       <u>-oo</u> <u>compressed</u> is now working again.  It was temporarily broken in virt-v2v 2.0.

       The documentation no longer advises you to use the dangerous global "LEGACY crypto" option, but provides
       more targeted advice (Laszlo Ersek).

       Remove the LVM2 devices file during conversion (Laszlo Ersek).

       Add support for guests using Zstandard compressed kernel modules.

       Add the BOCHS DRM display driver in Linux guest initrd, to avoid a crash with some guests with graphical
       boot displays (Laszlo Ersek).

       The UEFI fallback boot loader is now fixed up if we detect that it was broken (Laszlo Ersek).

       Improve detection of guests using BIOS boot with GPT partitions so that we no longer confuse them with
       UEFI guests (Andrey Drobyshev).

       Fix conflict between fwcfg and qemufwcfg Windows drivers (Laszlo Ersek).

       Fix Windows 11 support for RHV outputs (Laszlo Ersek).

   <b>Build</b> <b>changes</b>
       Enable malloc debugging in tests with glibc ≥ 2.34.

       When using "make check-valgrind", valgrind output is no longer written to separate files under <u>tmp/</u>.
       Instead it is written to the normal test log file.

       We now require ocamldep <u>-one-line</u> and <u>-all</u> options (added to ocamldep in Jan 2012).

       The OCaml libvirt bindings are no longer bundled.  They must be available at build time.

       Updated the phony test images.  The tests should all pass.

       Add compatibility with OCaml 4.14.

       We now require PCRE2 instead of PCRE.

   <b>Internals</b>
       New LUKS-on-LVM test added (Laszlo Ersek).

       Added <u>scripts/git.orderfile</u> which orders files when we prepare patches.
