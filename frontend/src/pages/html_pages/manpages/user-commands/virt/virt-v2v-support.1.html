</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       virt-v2v-support - Supported hypervisors, virtualization management systems and guests in virt-v2v

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This page documents which foreign hypervisors, virtualization management systems and guest types that
       <b><a href="../man1/virt-v2v.1.html">virt-v2v</a></b>(1) can support.

       Note this page applies to upstream virt-v2v from <a href="http://libguestfs.org">http://libguestfs.org</a> and in downstream distributions of
       virt-v2v sometimes features are intentionally removed, or are present but not supported.

   <b>Hypervisors</b> <b>(Input)</b>
       VMware ESXi
           Must be managed by VMware vCenter ≥ 5.0 unless VDDK is available.

       OVA exported from VMware
           OVAs from other hypervisors will not work.

       VMX from VMware
           VMX files generated by other hypervisors will not work.

       RHEL 5 Xen
       SUSE Xen
       Citrix Xen
           Citrix Xen has not been recently tested.

       Hyper-V
           Not recently tested.  Requires that you export the disk or use <b><a href="../man1/virt-p2v.1.html">virt-p2v</a></b>(1) on Hyper-V.

       Direct from disk images
           Only disk images exported from supported hypervisors, and using container formats supported by qemu.

       Physical machines
           Using the <b><a href="../man1/virt-p2v.1.html">virt-p2v</a></b>(1) tool.

   <b>Hypervisors</b> <b>(Output)</b>
       QEMU and KVM only.

   <b>Virtualization</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> <b>(Output)</b>
       OpenStack
       Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) 4.1 and up
       Local libvirt
           And hence <b><a href="../man1/virsh.1.html">virsh</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/virt-manager.1.html">virt-manager</a></b>(1), and similar tools.

       Local disk

   <b>Guests</b>
       Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6, 7
       CentOS 4, 5, 6, 7
       Scientific Linux 4, 5, 6, 7
       Oracle Linux
       Fedora
       SLES 10 and up
       OpenSUSE 10 and up
       ALT Linux 9 and up
       Debian 6 and up
       Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04, 14.04, 16.04, and up
       Windows XP to Windows 10 / Windows Server 2016
           We           use           Windows           internal          version          numbers,          see
           https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_Windows_versions

           Currently NT 5.2 to NT 6.3 are supported.

           See "WINDOWS" below for additional notes on converting Windows guests.

   <b>Guest</b> <b>firmware</b>
       BIOS is supported for all guest types and hypervisors.

       VMware allows you to present UEFI firmware to guests (instead of the ordinary  PC  BIOS).   Virt-v2v  can
       convert these guests, but requires that UEFI is supported by the target hypervisor.

       Currently KVM supports OVMF, an open source UEFI firmware, and can run these guests.

       Since  OVMF  support  was  only recently added to KVM (in 2014/2015), not all target environments support
       UEFI guests yet:

       UEFI on libvirt, qemu
           Supported.  Virt-v2v will generate the correct libvirt XML (metadata) automatically,  but  note  that
           the  same  version  of  OVMF  must  be installed on the conversion host as is installed on the target
           hypervisor, else you will have to adjust paths in the metadata.

       UEFI on OpenStack
           Supported since virt-v2v ≥ 1.43.2.

       UEFI on oVirt or RHV
           Supported since oVirt/RHV ≥ 4.2 and virt-v2v ≥ 1.39.12.
