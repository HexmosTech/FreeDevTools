</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       virt-edit - Edit a file in a virtual machine

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        virt-edit [--options] -d domname file [file ...]

        virt-edit [--options] -a disk.img [-a disk.img ...] file [file ...]

        virt-edit [-d domname|-a disk.img] file -e 'expr'

       Old-style:

        virt-edit domname file

        virt-edit disk.img [disk.img ...] file

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       Using "virt-edit" on live virtual machines, or concurrently with other disk editing tools, can be
       dangerous, potentially causing disk corruption.  The virtual machine must be shut down before you use
       this command, and disk images must not be edited concurrently.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "virt-edit" is a command line tool to edit "file" where each "file" exists in the named virtual machine
       (or disk image).

       Multiple filenames can be given, in which case they are each edited in turn.  Each filename must be a
       full path, starting at the root directory (starting with '/').

       If you want to just view a file, use <b><a href="../man1/virt-cat.1.html">virt-cat</a></b>(1).

       For more complex cases you should look at the <b><a href="../man1/guestfish.1.html">guestfish</a></b>(1) tool (see "USING GUESTFISH" below).

       "virt-edit" cannot be used to create a new file.  <b><a href="../man1/guestfish.1.html">guestfish</a></b>(1) can do that and much more.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Edit the named files interactively:

        virt-edit -d mydomain /boot/grub/grub.conf

        virt-edit -d mydomain <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>

       For Windows guests, some Windows paths are understood:

        virt-edit -d mywindomain 'c:\autoexec.bat'

       If Perl is installed, you can also edit files non-interactively (see "NON-INTERACTIVE EDITING" below).
       To change the init default level to 5:

        virt-edit -d mydomain /etc/inittab -e 's/^id:.*/id:5:initdefault:/'

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b>
           Display brief help.

       <b>-a</b> file
       <b>--add</b> file
           Add  <u>file</u>  which  should be a disk image from a virtual machine.  If the virtual machine has multiple
           block devices, you must supply all of them with separate <u>-a</u> options.

           The format of the disk image is auto-detected.  To override this and force a  particular  format  use
           the <u>--format=..</u> option.

       <b>-a</b> URI
       <b>--add</b> URI
           Add a remote disk.  See "ADDING REMOTE STORAGE" in <b><a href="../man1/guestfish.1.html">guestfish</a></b>(1).

       <b>-b</b> EXTENSION
       <b>--backup</b> EXTENSION
           Create  a  backup of the original file <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>guest</u> <u>disk</u> <u>image</u>.  The backup has the original filename
           with "extension" added.

           Usually the first character of "extension" would be a dot "."  so you would write:

            virt-edit -b .orig [etc]

           By default, no backup file is made.

       <b>--blocksize=512</b>
       <b>--blocksize=4096</b>
       <b>--blocksize</b>
           This parameter sets the sector size of the disk image.  It affects all  explicitly  added  subsequent
           disks  after this parameter.  Using <u>--blocksize</u> with no argument switches the disk sector size to the
           default value which is usually 512 bytes.  See also "guestfs_add_drive_opts" in <b><a href="../man3/guestfs.3.html">guestfs</a></b>(3).

       <b>-c</b> URI
       <b>--connect</b> URI
           If using libvirt, connect to the given <u>URI</u>.  If omitted, then  we  connect  to  the  default  libvirt
           hypervisor.

           If you specify guest block devices directly, then libvirt is not used at all.

       <b>-d</b> GUEST
       <b>--domain</b> GUEST
           Add all the disks from the named libvirt guest.  Domain UUIDs can be used instead of names.

       <b>--echo-keys</b>
           When  prompting for keys and passphrases, virt-edit normally turns echoing off so you cannot see what
           you are typing.  If you are not worried about Tempest attacks and there is no one else  in  the  room
           you can specify this flag to see what you are typing.

       <b>-e</b> EXPR
       <b>--edit</b> EXPR
       <b>--expr</b> EXPR
           Instead  of launching the external editor, non-interactively apply the Perl expression "EXPR" to each
           line in the file.  See "NON-INTERACTIVE EDITING" below.

           Be careful to properly quote the expression to prevent it from being altered by the shell.

           Note that this option is only available when Perl 5 is installed.

       <b>--format=raw|qcow2|..</b>
       <b>--format</b>
           The default for the <u>-a</u> option is to auto-detect the format of the disk image.  Using this forces  the
           disk  format  for  <u>-a</u>  options  which  follow  on  the command line.  Using <u>--format</u> with no argument
           switches back to auto-detection for subsequent <u>-a</u> options.

           For example:

            virt-edit --format=raw -a disk.img file

           forces raw format (no auto-detection) for <u>disk.img</u>.

            virt-edit --format=raw -a disk.img --format -a another.img file

           forces raw format (no auto-detection) for <u>disk.img</u> and reverts to auto-detection for <u>another.img</u>.

           If you have untrusted raw-format guest disk images, you should use this option to  specify  the  disk
           format.  This avoids a possible security problem with malicious guests (CVE-2010-3851).

       <b>--key</b> SELECTOR
           Specify a key for LUKS, to automatically open a LUKS device when using the inspection.

           <b>--key</b> NAME<b>:key:</b>KEY_STRING
           <b>--key</b> UUID<b>:key:</b>KEY_STRING
           <b>--key</b> <b>all:key:</b>KEY_STRING
               "NAME"  is the libguestfs device name (eg. "/dev/sda1").  "UUID" is the device UUID.  "all" means
               try the key against any encrypted device.

               Use the specified "KEY_STRING" as passphrase.

           <b>--key</b> NAME<b>:file:</b>FILENAME
           <b>--key</b> UUID<b>:file:</b>FILENAME
           <b>--key</b> <b>all:file:</b>FILENAME
               Read the passphrase from <u>FILENAME</u>.

           <b>--key</b> NAME<b>:clevis</b>
           <b>--key</b> UUID<b>:clevis</b>
           <b>--key</b> <b>all:clevis</b>
               Attempt passphrase-less unlocking for the device with Clevis, over the network.  Please refer  to
               "ENCRYPTED DISKS" in <b><a href="../man3/guestfs.3.html">guestfs</a></b>(3) for more information on network-bound disk encryption (NBDE).

               Note  that  if  any  such  option  is  present  on the command line, QEMU user networking will be
               automatically enabled for the libguestfs appliance.

       <b>--keys-from-stdin</b>
           Read key or passphrase parameters from stdin.  The default is to try to  read  passphrases  from  the
           user by opening <u>/dev/tty</u>.

           If  there  are multiple encrypted devices then you may need to supply multiple keys on stdin, one per
           line.

       <b>-m</b> dev[:mountpoint[:options[:fstype]]]
       <b>--mount</b> dev[:mountpoint[:options[:fstype]]]
           Mount the named partition or logical volume on the given mountpoint.

           If the mountpoint is omitted, it defaults to <u>/</u>.

           Specifying any mountpoint disables the inspection of the guest and the mount of its root and  all  of
           its mountpoints, so make sure to mount all the mountpoints needed to work with the filenames given as
           arguments.

           If  you  donâ€™t know what filesystems a disk image contains, you can either run guestfish without this
           option, then list the partitions,  filesystems  and  LVs  available  (see  "list-partitions",  "list-
           filesystems" and "lvs" commands), or you can use the <b><a href="../man1/virt-filesystems.1.html">virt-filesystems</a></b>(1) program.

           The  third  (and  rarely used) part of the mount parameter is the list of mount options used to mount
           the underlying filesystem.  If this is not given, then the mount options are either the empty  string
           or  "ro"  (the  latter if the <u>--ro</u> flag is used).  By specifying the mount options, you override this
           default choice.  Probably the only time you  would  use  this  is  to  enable  ACLs  and/or  extended
           attributes if the filesystem can support them:

            -m /dev/sda1:/:acl,user_xattr

           Using this flag is equivalent to using the "mount-options" command.

           The  fourth  part of the parameter is the filesystem driver to use, such as "ext3" or "ntfs". This is
           rarely needed, but can be useful if multiple drivers are valid  for  a  filesystem  (eg:  "ext2"  and
           "ext3"), or if libguestfs misidentifies a filesystem.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
           Enable verbose messages for debugging.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
           Display version number and exit.

       <b>-x</b>  Enable tracing of libguestfs API calls.

</pre><h4><b>OLD-STYLE</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Previous versions of virt-edit allowed you to write either:

        virt-edit disk.img [disk.img ...] file

       or

        virt-edit guestname file

       whereas  in  this  version  you should use <u>-a</u> or <u>-d</u> respectively to avoid the confusing case where a disk
       image might have the same name as a guest.

       For compatibility the old style is still supported.

</pre><h4><b>NON-INTERACTIVE</b> <b>EDITING</b></h4><pre>
       "virt-edit" normally calls out to $EDITOR (or vi) so the system administrator can interactively edit  the
       file.

       There are two ways also to use "virt-edit" from scripts in order to make automated edits to files.  (Note
       that  although  you  <u>can</u> use "virt-edit" like this, itâ€™s less error-prone to write scripts directly using
       the libguestfs API and Augeas for configuration file editing.)

       The first method is to temporarily set $EDITOR to any script or program you want to run.  The  script  is
       invoked as "$EDITOR tmpfile" and it should update "tmpfile" in place however it likes.

       The  second  method is to use the <u>-e</u> parameter of "virt-edit" to run a short Perl snippet in the style of
       <b><a href="../man1/sed.1.html">sed</a></b>(1).  For example to replace all instances of "foo" with "bar" in a file:

        virt-edit -d domname filename -e 's/foo/bar/'

       The full power of Perl regular expressions can be used (see <b><a href="../man1/perlre.1.html">perlre</a></b>(1)).  For  example  to  delete  rootâ€™s
       password you could do:

        virt-edit -d domname <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> -e 's/^root:.*?:<a href="file:/root">/root</a>::/'

       What really happens is that the snippet is evaluated as a Perl expression for each line of the file.  The
       line,  including  the  final  "\n",  is  passed  in  $_  and  the expression should update $_ or leave it
       unchanged.

       To delete a line, set $_ to the empty string.  For example, to delete the "apache" user account from  the
       password file you can do:

        virt-edit -d mydomain <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> -e '$_ = "" if /^apache:/'

       To  insert  a line, prepend or append it to $_.  However appending lines to the end of the file is rather
       difficult this way since there is no concept of "last line of the file" - your  expression  just  doesn't
       get called again.  You might want to use the first method (setting $EDITOR) if you want to do this.

       The  variable $lineno contains the current line number.  As is traditional, the first line in the file is
       number 1.

       The return value from the expression is ignored, but the expression may call "die" in order to abort  the
       whole program, leaving the original file untouched.

       Remember  when  matching the end of a line that $_ may contain the final "\n", or (for DOS files) "\r\n",
       or if the file does not end with a newline then neither of these.  Thus to match or substitute some  text
       at the end of a line, use this regular expression:

        /some text(\r?\n)?$/

       Alternately, use the perl "chomp" function, being careful not to chomp $_ itself (since that would remove
       all newlines from the file):

        my $m = $_; chomp $m; $m =~ /some text$/

</pre><h4><b>WINDOWS</b> <b>PATHS</b></h4><pre>
       "virt-edit" has a limited ability to understand Windows drive letters and paths (eg. <u>E:\foo\bar.txt</u>).

       If and only if the guest is running Windows then:

       â€¢   Drive letter prefixes like "C:" are resolved against the Windows Registry to the correct filesystem.

       â€¢   Any  backslash  ("\") characters in the path are replaced with forward slashes so that libguestfs can
           process it.

       â€¢   The path is resolved case insensitively to locate the file that should be edited.

       There are some known shortcomings:

       â€¢   Some NTFS symbolic links may not be followed correctly.

       â€¢   NTFS junction points that cross filesystems are not followed.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>GUESTFISH</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man1/guestfish.1.html">guestfish</a></b>(1) is a more powerful, lower level tool which you can use when "virt-edit" doesn't work.

       Using "virt-edit" is approximately equivalent to doing:

        guestfish --rw -i -d domname edit /file

       where "domname" is the name of the libvirt guest, and <u>/file</u> is the full path to the file.

       The command above uses libguestfsâ€™s guest inspection  feature  and  so  does  not  work  on  guests  that
       libguestfs  cannot inspect, or on things like arbitrary disk images that don't contain guests.  To edit a
       file on a disk image directly, use:

        guestfish --rw -a disk.img -m /dev/sda1 edit /file

       where <u>disk.img</u> is the disk image, <u>/dev/sda1</u> is the filesystem within the disk image to edit, and <u>/file</u> is
       the full path to the file.

       "virt-edit" cannot create new files.  Use the guestfish commands "touch", "write" or "upload" instead:

        guestfish --rw -i -d domname touch /newfile

        guestfish --rw -i -d domname write /newfile "new content"

        guestfish --rw -i -d domname upload localfile /newfile

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       "EDITOR"
           If set, this string is used as the editor.  It may contain arguments, eg. "emacs -nw"

           If not set, "vi" is used.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       This program returns 0 if successful, or non-zero if there was an error.
