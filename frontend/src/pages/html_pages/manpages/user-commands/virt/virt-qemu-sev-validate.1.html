       virt-qemu-sev-validate - validate a domain AMD SEV launch measurement

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>virt-qemu-sev-validate</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program validates the reported measurement for a domain launched with AMD SEV. If the program exits
       with a status of zero, the guest owner can be  confident  that  their  guest  OS  is  running  under  the
       protection offered by the SEV / SEV-ES platform.

       Note  that the level of protection varies depending on the AMD SEV platform generation and describing the
       differences is outside the scope of this document.

       For the results of this program to be considered trustworthy, it is required to be run on a machine  that
       is  already  trusted by the guest owner. This could be a machine that the guest owner has direct physical
       control over, or it could be another virtual machine protected by AMD SEV that has already had its launch
       measurement validated. Running this program on the virtualization host will not produce  an  answer  that
       can be trusted.

       If  told  to connect to libvirt, it will refuse to use a libvirt connection that is local to the machine,
       since that cannot be trusted. For the sake of testing or  demonstration  purposes,  however,  it  can  be
       forced  to  run  in  this  scenario  using  the <b>--insecure</b> flag. The result will, of course, still not be
       trustworthy.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Common</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>

       Display command line help usage then exit.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>

       Show debug information while running

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>

       Don't print information about the attestation result.

   <b>Guest</b> <b>state</b> <b>options</b>
       These options provide information about the state of the guest that needs its boot attested.

       <b>--measurement</b> <b>BASE64-STRING</b>

       The launch measurement reported by the hypervisor of the domain to be validated.  The measurement must be
       48 bytes of binary data encoded as a base64 string.

       <b>--api-major</b> <b>VERSION</b>

       The SEV API major version of the hypervisor the domain is running on.

       <b>--api-minor</b> <b>VERSION</b>

       The SEV API major version of the hypervisor the domain is running on.

       <b>--build-id</b> <b>ID</b>

       The SEV build ID of the hypervisor the domain is running on.

       <b>--policy</b> <b>POLiCY</b>

       The policy bitmask associated with the session launch data of the domain to be validated.

   <b>Guest</b> <b>config</b> <b>options</b>
       These options provide items needed to calculate the expected domain launch measurement. This will then be
       compared to the reported launch measurement.

       <b>-f</b> <b>PATH</b>, <b>--firmware=PATH</b>

       Path to the firmware loader binary. This is the EDK2 build that knows how to initialize AMD SEV. For  the
       validation  to  be  trustworthy  it  important  that  the  firmware build used has no support for loading
       non-volatile variables from NVRAM, even if NVRAM is expose to the guest.

       <b>-k</b> <b>PATH</b>, <b>--kernel=PATH</b>

       Path to the kernel binary if doing direct kernel boot.

       <b>-r</b> <b>PATH</b>, <b>--initrd=PATH</b>

       Path to the initrd binary if doing direct kernel boot. Defaults to zero length content if omitted.

       <b>-e</b> <b>STRING</b>, <b>--cmdline=STRING</b>

       String containing any kernel command line parameters used during boot of  the  domain.  Defaults  to  the
       empty string if omitted.

       <b>-n</b> <b>COUNT</b>, <b>--num-cpus=COUNT</b>

       The  number  of  virtual  CPUs  for the domain. This is required when the domain policy is set to require
       SEV-ES.

       <b>-0</b> <b>PATH</b>, <b>--vmsa-cpu0=PATH</b>

       Path to the VMSA initial state for the boot CPU. This is required  when  the  domain  policy  is  set  to
       require SEV-ES. The file contents must be exactly 4096 bytes in length.

       <b>-1</b> <b>PATH</b>, <b>--vmsa-cpu1=PATH</b>

       Path  to  the  VMSA initial state for the non-boot CPU. This is required when the domain policy is set to
       require SEV-ES and the domain has more than one CPU present. The file contents must be exactly 4096 bytes
       in length.

       <b>--tik</b> <b>PATH</b>

       TIK file for domain. This file must be exactly 16  bytes  in  size  and  contains  the  unique  transport
       integrity  key  associated with the domain session launch data.  This is mutually exclusive with the <b>--tk</b>
       argument.

       <b>--tek</b> <b>PATH</b>

       TEK file for domain. This file must be exactly 16  bytes  in  size  and  contains  the  unique  transport
       encryption  key associated with the domain session launch data.  This is mutually exclusive with the <b>--tk</b>
       argument.

       <b>--tk</b> <b>PATH</b>

       TEK/TIK combined file for the domain. This file must be exactly 32 bytes in size, with the first 16 bytes
       containing the TEK and the last 16 bytes containing the TIK.  This is mutually exclusive with  the  <b>--tik</b>
       and <b>--tek</b> arguments.

   <b>Libvirt</b> <b>options</b>
       These  options  are  used  when  connecting  to  libvirt  to automatically obtain state and configuration
       information about the domain to be attested.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--connect</b> <b>URI</b>

       Libvirt connection URI. For the validation to be trustworthy this must be a URI  resolving  to  a  remote
       virtualization host. This requirement can be overridden using the <b>--insecure</b> argument.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--domain</b> <b>ID|NAME|UUID</b>

       Domain  ID,  or  domain  name or domain UUID. Used to identify which libvirt domain is to have its launch
       measured. The domain must be running, and would usually have been started in a  paused  state,  to  allow
       validation to be performed before guest CPUs begin execution.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--insecure</b>

       Proceed  even  if  usage  scenario is known to be insecure. This allows the program to connect to a local
       libvirt hypervisor and rely on file content from the virtualization host. It also allows  the  validation
       to  proceed  even  if  the  virtual  machine  CPUs are not in the initial paused state. The result of the
       validation must not be trusted.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--ignore-config</b>

       Do not attempt to sanity check the domain config. The  default  behaviour  is  to  print  out  errors  if
       identifying  configuration  elements  in the guest XML that would invalidate the launch measurement. This
       can help the guest  owner  to  understand  any  configuration  mistakes  that  have  been  made.  If  the
       <b>--ignore-config</b>  argument  is given, this sanity checking of configuration will be skipped. The result is
       that the validation will likely be reported as failed.

   <b>Secret</b> <b>injection</b> <b>options</b>
       These options provide a way to inject a secret if validation of the launch measurement passes.

       <b>--inject-secret</b> <b>ALIAS-OR-GUID:PATH</b>

       Path to a file containing a secret to inject into the guest OS.  Typical  usage  would  be  to  supply  a
       password  for  unlocking  the  root  filesystem  full disk encryption. <b>ALIAS</b> can be one of the well known
       secrets:

       • <b>luks-key</b>   -   bytes   to   use   as   a   key   for   unlocking   a   LUKS   key   slot.    GUID    of
         <b>736869e5-84f0-4973-92ec-06879ce3da0b</b>.

       Alternatively  <b>GUID</b> refers to an arbitrary UUID of the callers choosing. The contents of <b>PATH</b> are defined
       by the requirements of the associated GUID, and will used as-is without modification.  In  particular  be
       aware:

          • Avoid unwanted trailing newline characters in <b>PATH</b> unless mandated by the <b>GUID</b>.

          • Any trailing <b>NUL</b> byte must be explicitly included in <b>PATH</b> if mandated by the <b>GUID</b>.

       This argument can be repeated multiple times, provided a different <b>GUID</b> is given for each instance.

       <b>--secret-header</b> <b>PATH</b>

       Path  to  a  file in which the injected secret header will be written in base64 format and later injected
       into the domain. This is required if there is no connection to libvirt,  otherwise  the  secret  will  be
       directly injected.

       <b>--secret-payload</b> <b>PATH</b>

       Path  to  a file in which the injected secret payload will be written in base64 format and later injected
       into the domain. This is required if there is no connection to libvirt,  otherwise  the  secret  will  be
       directly injected.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Fully</b> <b>offline</b> <b>execution</b>
       This  scenario  allows  a  measurement to be securely validated in a completely offline state without any
       connection to the hypervisor host. All required data items must be provided as command  line  parameters.
       This usage model is considered secure, because all input data is provided by the user.

       Validate the measurement of a SEV guest booting from disk:

          # virt-qemu-sev-validate \

              --api-minor 24 \
              --build-id 13 \
              --policy 3

       Validate the measurement of a SEV guest with direct kernel boot:

          # virt-qemu-sev-validate \
              --firmware OVMF.sev.fd \
              --kernel vmlinuz-5.11.12 \
              --initrd initramfs-5.11.12 \

              --api-minor 24 \
              --build-id 13 \
              --policy 3

       Validate the measurement of a SEV-ES SMP guest booting from disk:

          # virt-qemu-sev-validate \
              --firmware OVMF.sev.fd \
              --num-cpus 2 \
              --vmsa-cpu0 vmsa0.bin \
              --vmsa-cpu1 vmsa1.bin \
              --tk this-guest-tk.bin \
              --measurement Zs2pf19ubFSafpZ2WKkwquXvACx9Wt/BV+eJwQ/taO8jhyIj/F8swFrybR1fZ2ID \
              --api-major 0 \
              --api-minor 24 \
              --build-id 13 \
              --policy 7

       Validate the measurement of a SEV-ES SMP guest booting from disk, with automatically constructed VMSA:

          # virt-qemu-sev-validate \
              --firmware OVMF.sev.fd \
              --num-cpus 2 \
              --cpu-family 23 \
              --cpu-model 49 \
              --cpu-stepping 0 \
              --tk this-guest-tk.bin \
              --measurement Zs2pf19ubFSafpZ2WKkwquXvACx9Wt/BV+eJwQ/taO8jhyIj/F8swFrybR1fZ2ID \
              --api-major 0 \
              --api-minor 24 \
              --build-id 13 \
              --policy 7

       Validate the measurement of a SEV guest booting from disk and inject a disk password on success:

          # virt-qemu-sev-validate \
              --firmware OVMF.sev.fd \
              --tk this-guest-tk.bin \
              --measurement Zs2pf19ubFSafpZ2WKkwquXvACx9Wt/BV+eJwQ/taO8jhyIj/F8swFrybR1fZ2ID \

              --secret-header secret-header.b64 \
              --secret-payload secret-payload.b64

       The  <b>secret-header.b64</b>  and  <b>secret-payload.b64</b>  files  can  now  be  sent to the virtualization host for
       injection.

   <b>Fetch</b> <b>from</b> <b>remote</b> <b>libvirt</b>
       This scenario allows fetching certain data from a remote hypervisor via a connection to libvirt. It  will
       aid  in  debugging  by analysing the guest configuration and reporting anything that could invalidate the
       measurement of the guest. This usage model is considered secure, because the limited information obtained
       from the untrusted hypervisor cannot be used to change the result.

       Validate the measurement of a SEV guest booting from disk:

          # virt-qemu-sev-validate \
              --connect qemu+ssh://<a href="mailto:root@some.remote.host">root@some.remote.host</a>/system \

              --tk this-guest-tk.bin \
              --domain fedora34x86_64

       Validate the measurement of a SEV guest with direct kernel boot:

          # virt-qemu-sev-validate \
              --connect qemu+ssh://<a href="mailto:root@some.remote.host">root@some.remote.host</a>/system \

              --initrd initramfs-5.11.12 \
              --cmdline "root=/dev/vda1" \
              --tk this-guest-tk.bin \
              --domain fedora34x86_64

       Validate the measurement of a SEV-ES SMP guest booting from disk:

   <b>Fetch</b> <b>from</b> <b>local</b> <b>libvirt</b>
       This scenario allows fetching all data from the local hypervisor via a connection to libvirt. It is  only
       to  be  used  for  the  purpose  of  testing,  debugging, or demonstrations, because running on the local
       hypervisor is not a secure scenario. To enable this usage, the <b>--insecure</b> flag must be specified. Given a
       pointer to the libvirt guest to validate, all information needed to  perform  a  validation,  except  the
       TIK/TEK pair can be acquired automatically.

       Validate the measurement of a SEV guest booting from disk:

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>MISTAKES</b> <b>CHECKLIST</b></h4><pre>
       The  complexity of configuring a guest and validating its boot measurement means it is very likely to see
       the failure:

          ERROR: Measurement does not match, VM is not trustworthy

       This error message assumes the worst, but in  most  cases  will  failure  will  be  a  result  of  either
       mis-configuring  the  guest,  or  passing the wrong information when trying to validate it. The following
       information is a guide for what items to check in order to  stand  the  best  chance  of  diagnosing  the
       problem

       • Check the VM configuration for the DH certificate and session blob in the libvirt guest XML.

         The  content for these fields should be in base64 format, which is what <b>sevctl</b> <b>session</b> generates. Other
         tools may generate the files in binary format, so ensure it has been correctly converted to base64.

       • Check the VM configuration policy value matches the session blob

         The <b>&lt;policy&gt;</b> value in libvirt guest XML has to match the value passed to the <b>sevctl</b> <b>session</b> command. If
         this is mismatched then the guest will not even start, and QEMU will show an error such as:

            sev_launch_start: LAUNCH_START ret=1 fw_error=11 'Bad measurement'

       • Check the correct TIK/TEK keypair are passed

         The TIK/TEK keypair are uniquely tied to each DH cert and session blob.  Make  sure  that  the  TIK/TEK
         keypair  passed  to  this  program  the ones matched to the DH cert and session blob configured for the
         libvirt guest XML. This is one of the most common mistakes.  Further ensure that the TIK and TEK  files
         are not swapped.

       • Check the firmware binary matches the one used to boot

         The  firmware  binary  content  is  part of the data covered by the launch measurement. Ensure that the
         firmware binary passed to this program matches the one used to launch the guest.  The  hypervisor  host
         will periodically get software updates which introduce a new firmware binary version.

       • Check the kernel, initrd and cmdline match the one used to boot

         If  the guest is configured to use direct kernel boot, check that the kernel, initrd and cmdline passed
         to this program match the ones used to boot the  guest.  In  the  kernel  cmdline  whitespace  must  be
         preserved exactly, including any leading or trailing spaces.

       • Check whether the kernel hash measurement is enabled

         The  <b>kernelHashes</b>  property  in the libvirt guest XML controls whether hashes of the kernel, initrd and
         cmdline content are covered by the boot measurement. If enabled, then  the  matching  content  must  be
         passed to this program. UIf disabled, then the content must <b>NOT</b> be passed.

       • Check that the correct measurement hash is passed

         The  measurement  hash  includes  a  nonce,  so  it  will be different on every boot attempt. Thus when
         validating the measuremnt it is important ensure the most recent measurement is used.

       • Check the correct VMSA blobs / CPU SKU values for the host are used

         The VMSA blobs provide the initial register state for the boot CPU and any additional CPUs. One of  the
         registers  encodes  the  CPU SKU (family, model, stepping) of the physical host CPU. Make sure that the
         VMSA blob used for validation is one that matches the SKU of the host the guest is booted  on.  Passing
         the CPU SKU values directly to the tool can reduce the likelihood of using the wrong ones.

       • Check the CPU count is correct

         When  passing  VMSA  blobs for SEV-ES guests, the number of CPUs present will influence the measurement
         result. Ensure that the correct vCPU count is used corresponding to the guest boot attempt.

       Best practice is to run this tool in completely offline mode and pass all information as explicit command
       line parameters. When debugging failures, however, it can be useful to tell it to connect to libvirt  and
       fetch  information. If connecting to a remote libvirt instance, it will fetch any information that can be
       trusted, which is the basic VM launch state data. It will also sanity  check  the  XML  configuration  to
       identify  some  common  mistakes.  If  the  <b>--insecure</b>  flag  is passed it can extract some configuration
       information and use that for the attestation process.

       If the mistake still can't be identified, then this tool can be run on the virtualization host.  In  that
       scenario the only three command line parameters required are for the TIK, TEK and libvirt domain name. It
       should  be  able  to  automatically  determine  all the other information required. If it still reports a
       failure, this points very strongly to the TIK/TEK pair not matching the  configured  DH  certificate  and
       session blob.

       The  <b>--debug</b>  flag  will  display  hashes  and/or hex dumps for various pieces of information used in the
       attestation process. Comparing the <b>--debug</b> output from running  on  the  hypervisor  host,  against  that
       obtained when running in offline mode can give further guidance to which parameter is inconsistent.

       As mentioned earlier in this document, bear in mind that in general any attestation answers obtained from
       running  on  the hypervisor host should not be trusted. So if a configuration mistake is identified it is
       strongly recommended to re-run the attestation in offline mode on a trusted machine.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful attestation of the launch measurement, an exit status of 0 will be set.

       Upon failure to attest the launch measurement one of the following codes will be set:

       • <b>1</b> - <u>Guest</u> <u>measurement</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u> <u>validate</u>

         Assuming the inputs to this program are correct, the virtual machine launch has been compromised and it
         should not be trusted henceforth.

       • <b>2</b> - <u>Usage</u> <u>scenario</u> <u>cannot</u> <u>be</u> <u>supported</u>

         The way in which this program has been invoked prevent it  from  being  able  to  validate  the  launch
         measurement.

       • <b>3</b> - <u>Usage</u> <u>scenario</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>secure</u>

         The  way  in  which  this  program  has  been  invoked  means that the result of any launch measurement
         validation will not be secure.

         The program can be reinvoked with <b>--insecure</b> argument to force a validation, however,  the  results  of
         this  should not be trusted. This should only be used for testing, debugging or demonstration purposes,
         never in a production deployment.

       • <b>4</b> - <u>Domain</u> <u>has</u> <u>incorrect</u> <u>configuration</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>measured</u>

         The way in which the guest has been configured prevent this program from being  able  to  validate  the
         launch  measurement.  Note  that  in  general the guest configuration reported by the hypervisor is not
         trustworthy, so it is possible this error could be a false positive  designed  to  cause  a  denial  of
         service.

         This program can be reinvoked with the <b>--ignore-config</b> argument to skip the sanity checks on the domain
         XML. This will likely result in it failing with an exit code of <b>1</b> indicating the measurement is invalid

       • <b>5</b> - <u>Domain</u> <u>is</u> <u>in</u> <u>incorrect</u> <u>state</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>measured</u>

         The domain has to be running in order to validate a launch measurement.

       • <b>6</b> - <u>unexpected</u> <u>error</u> <u>occurred</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>code</u>

         A  logic flaw in this program means it is unable to complete the validation of the measurement. This is
         a bug which should be reported to the maintainers.
