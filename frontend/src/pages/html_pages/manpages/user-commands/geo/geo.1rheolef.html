</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       geo - plot a finite element mesh (rheolef-7.2)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       geo [options] file[.geo[.gz]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Plot or upgrade a finite element mesh.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Plot a mesh:

           geo square.geo
           geo box.geo
           geo box.geo -full

        Plot a mesh into a file:

           geo square.geo -image-format png

        Convert from a old geo file format to the new one:

           geo -upgrade - &lt; square-old.geo &gt; square.geo

        See below for the geo file format specification. The old file format does not contains edges and faces
       connectivity in 3d geometries, or edges connectivity in 2d geometries. The converter add it automatically
       into the upgraded file format. Conversely, the old file format is useful when combined with a translator
       from another file format that do not provides edges and faces connectivity.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       filename

            Specifies the name of the file containing the input mesh. The '.geo' suffix extension is assumed.

       -

            Read mesh on standard input instead on a file.

       -name <u>string</u>

            When mesh comes from standard input, the mesh name is not known and is set to 'output' by default.
           This option allows one to change this default. This option is useful when dealing with output formats
           (graphic, format conversion) that creates auxiliary files, based on this name.

        -I<u>dir</u>
       -I <u>dir</u>

            Add <u>dir</u> to the Rheolef file search path. This mechanism initializes a search path given by the
           environment variable RHEOPATH. If the environment variable RHEOPATH is not set, the default value is
           the current directory.

       -check

            Check the mesh file: numbering, bounds and that for all element, its orientation is positive.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -if <u>format</u>
       -input-format <u>format</u>

            Load mesh in a given file format. Supported input formats are: geo, bamg, vtk.

</pre><h4><b>RENDER</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       -gnuplot

            Use the gnuplot tool. This is the default for 1D geometry.

       -paraview

            Use the paraview tool. This is the default for 2D and 3D geometries.

</pre><h4><b>RENDER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -[no]lattice

            When using a high order geometry, the lattice inside any element appears. Default is on.

       -[no]full

            All internal edges appears, for 3d meshes. Default is off.

       -[no]fill

            Fill mesh faces using light effects, when available.

        -[no]stereo

            Rendering mode suitable for red-blue anaglyph 3D stereoscopic glasses. Option only available with
           paraview.

       -[no]shrink

            shrink elements (with paraview only).

       -[no]cut

            cut by plane and clip (with paraview only).

       -[no]showlabel

            Show or hide labels, boundary domains and various annotations. By default, domains are showed with a
           specific color.

       -round [*float*]

            Round the input up to the specified precision. This option, combined with -geo, leads to a round
           filter. Useful for non-regression test purpose, in order to compare numerical results between files
           with a limited precision, since the full double precision is machine-dependent.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -geo

            output mesh on standard output stream in geo text file format, instead of plotting it.

       -upgrade

            Convert from a old geo file format to the new one.

       -gmsh

            Output mesh on standard output stream in gmsh text file format, instead of plotting it.

       -image-format <u>string</u>

            The argument is any valid image format, such as bitmap png, jpg, gif, tif, ppm, bmp or vectorial
           pdf, eps, ps, svg image file formats. this option can be used with the paraview and the gnuplot
           renders. The output file is e.g. basename.png when basename is the name of the mesh, or can be set
           with the -name option.

       -resolution <u>int</u> <u>int</u>

            The two arguments represent a couple of sizes, for the image resolution, e.g. 1024 and 768 for a
           1024x768 image size. This option can be used together with the -image-format for any of the bitmap
           image formats. This option requires the paraview render.

</pre><h4><b>OTHERS</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -subdivide <u>int</u>

            Subdivide each edge in <u>k</u> parts, where <u>k</u> is the prescribed argument. The new vertices are numbered so
           that they coincide with the P<u>k</u> Lagrange nodes. It can be combined with the -geo option to get the
           subdivided mesh. In that case, default value is 1, i.e. no subdividing. It can also be combined with
           a graphic option, such that -gnuplot or paraview: When dealing with a curved high order geometry, <u>k</u>
           corresponds to the number of points per edge used to draw a curved element. In that case, this option
           is activated by default and value is the curved mesh order.

        -add-boundary

            Check for a domain named 'boundary'. If this domain does not exists, extract the boundary of the
           geometry and append it to the domain list. This command is useful for mesh converted from generators,
           as bamg, that cannot have more than one domain specification per boundary edge.

       -rz
       -zr

            Specifies the coordinate system. Useful when converting from bamg or gmsh format, that do not have
           any coordinate system specification.

       -[no]verbose

            Print messages related to graphic files created and command system calls (this is the default).

       `-[no]clean

            Clear temporary graphic files (this is the default).

       -[no]execute

            Execute graphic command (this is the default). The -noexecute variant is useful in conjunction with
           the -verbose and -noclean options in order to modify some render options by hand.

       -dump

            Used for debug purpose.

</pre><h4><b>INQUIRE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -size
       -n-element

            Print the mesh size, i.e. the number of elements and then exit.

       -n-vertex

            Print the number of elements and then exit.

       -sys-coord

            Print the coordinate system and then exit.

       -hmin
       -hmax

            Print the smallest (resp. largest) edge length and then exit.

       -xmin
       -xmax

            Print the bounding box lower-left (resp. top-right) corner and exit.

       -min-element-measure
       -max-element-measure

            Print the smallest (resp. largest) element measure and then exit.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>CONVERSION</b></h4><pre>
       For the gmsh and bamg mesh generators, automatic file conversion is provided by the msh2geo and bamg2geo
       commands (see <b>bamg2geo_1</b> and <b>msh2geo_1</b> ).

       For conversion from the .vtk legacy ascii file format to the .geo one, simply writes:

       geo -if vtk -geo - &lt; input.vtk &gt; output.geo

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>GEO</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       This is the default mesh file format. It contains two entities, namely a mesh and a list of domains. The
       mesh entity starts with the mesh keyword, that should be at the beginning of a line. It is followed by
       the geo format version number: the current mesh format version number is 4. Next comes the header,
       containing global information: the space dimension (e.g. 1, 2 or 3), the number of nodes and the number
       of elements, for each type of element (tetrahedron, etc). When dimension is three, the number of faces
       (triangles, quadrangles) is specified, and then, when dimension is two or three, the number of edges is
       also specified. Follows the node coordinates list and the elements connectivity list. Each element starts
       with a letter indicating the element type:

           letter | element type
           -------|-------------
           p      | point
           e      | edge
           t      | triangle
           q      | quadrangle
           T      | tetrahedron
           P      | prism
           H      | hexahedron

        Then, for each element, comes the vertex indexes. A vertex index is numbered in the C-style, i.e. the
       first index started at 0 and the larger one is the number of vertices minus one. A sample mesh writes:

           mesh
           4
           header
            dimension 2
            nodes     4
            triangles 2
            edges     5
           end header
           0 0
           1 0
           1 1
           0 1
           t   0 1 3
           t   1 2 3
           e   0 1
           e   1 2
           e   2 3
           e   3 0
           e   1 3

        Note that information about edges for 2d meshes and faces for 3d one are required for maintaining P2 and
       higher order approximation fields in a consistent way: degrees of freedom associated to sides requires
       that sides are well defined.

       The second entity is a list of domains, that finishes with the end of file. A domain starts with the
       domain keyword, that should be at the beginning of a line. It is followed by the domain name, a simple
       string. Then, comes the domain format version: the current domain version number is 2. Next, the domain
       dimension and its number of elements. Finally, the list of elements: they are specified by the element
       index in the mesh, preceded by its orientation. A minus sign specifies that the element (generally a
       side) has the opposite orientation, while the plus sign is omitted. A sample domain list writes:

           domain
           bottom
           2 1 1
           0

           domain
           top
           2 1 1
           2

        Copy and paste the previous sample mesh data in a file, e.g. 'square.geo'. Be carreful for the 'mesh'
       and 'domain' to be at the beginning of a line. Then enter:

       geo square.geo

        and the mesh is displayed.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>SIMPLIFIED</b> <b>GEO</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Information about edges for 2d meshes and faces for 3d one is not provided by most mesh generators (e.g.
       gmsh or bamg). It could be complex to build this list, so a simplified file format is also supported,
       without faces and/or edges connectivity, and the geo command proposes to build it automatically and save
       it in a more complete, upgraded geo file.

       The simplified version of the previous mesh is:

           mesh
           4
           header
            dimension 2
            nodes     4
            triangles 2
           end header
           0 0
           1 0
           1 1
           0 1
           t   0 1 3
           t   1 2 3

        The domain list is no more able to refer to existing sides: edges are simply listed by their complete
       connectivity, thanks to the domain format version number 1. For the previous example, we have:

           domain
           bottom
           1 1 1
           e 0 1

           domain
           top
           1 1 1
           e 2 3

        Copy and paste the previous simplified sample mesh data in a file, e.g. square0.geo. Be carreful for the
       mesh and domain keywords to be at the beginning of a line. Then enter:

           geo -upgrade -geo square0.geo

        and the previous mesh with its complete connectivity is displayed: edges has been automatically
       identified and numbered, and domains now refers to edge indexes.
