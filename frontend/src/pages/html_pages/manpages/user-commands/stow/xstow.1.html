</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XStow, replacement for GNU Stow

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       xstow        [OPTION ...] PACKAGE

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       XStow is a replacement of GNU Stow (<b>stow</b>) written in C++. It supports all features of Stow with some
       extensions.

       XStow as GNU Stow, are programs for managing the installation of software packages, keeping them separate
       (/usr/local/stow/emacs vs. /usr/local/stow/perl, for example) while making them appear to be installed in
       the same place (<a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>).

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       xstow [OPTION ...] PACKAGE

       Install a package

               xstow foobar

       Uninstall package

               xstow -D foobar

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-dl</b> <b>-debug-level</b> INT
           Set's the debug level. An unsigned integer is accepted. The default value is 0.

       <b>-dm</b> <b>-debug-module</b> [ALL|ARG|MAIN|TREE|CPPDIR]
           Filter messages from a specific module.

       <b>-h</b> <b>-help</b>
           Shows a help screen.

       <b>-V</b> <b>-Version</b>
           Displays XStows version number and supported features.

       <b>-n</b> <b>-no</b>
           Do not actually make changes

       <b>-c</b> <b>-conflicts</b>
           Scan for conflicts, implies <b>-n</b>.

       <b>-s</b> <b>-simulate</b>
           Simulate installation. If this option is set permission problems will be ignored and <b>-verbose</b> will be
           set to 1.

       <b>-d</b> <b>-dir</b> DIR
           Set stow dir to DIR. The default is the current directory.

       <b>-t</b> <b>-target</b> DIR
           Set target to DIR. The default is the parent of the stow directory.

       <b>-v</b> <b>-verbose</b> [0|1|2|3]
           Increase verboseness. Possible levels are 0,1,2 or 3. Simple setting <b>-v</b> or <b>-verbose</b> adds 1.

       <b>-D</b> <b>-delete</b>
           Unstow instead of stow. Deinstall the package.

       <b>-R</b> <b>-restow</b>
           The same like <b>-delete</b> followed by an reinstall.

       <b>-ap</b> <b>-absolute-path</b>
           Create  symlinks with absolute path names. XStow can always handle packages which were installed with
           this option. Installing one package with absolute path names and one without is no problem. Only  the
           creation  of  the  symlinks  will  be affected by this option. This will cause that if one package is
           installed with this option and one without, some of the symlinks of the first package, when they have
           to be recreated will be recreated as relative ones. It is not good idea doing this, even  XStow  does
           not have any problems with it.  <u>Warning:</u> Breaks compatibility with Stow!

       <b>-tr</b> <b>-traversable</b> LINKS
           A  list  of  links  pointing  to  directories, that can be ignored.  eg.: <a href="file:/usr/local/man">/usr/local/man</a> is a link to
           <a href="file:/usr/local/share/man">/usr/local/share/man</a> <u>Warning:</u> Breaks compatibility with Stow!

       <b>-tkt</b> <b>-tr-keep-targets</b>
           Add the list of traversable links also to the keep targets list. This prevents  the  targets  of  the
           links from being removed by XStow, which would cause that the traversable link becomes a dead link.

       <b>-tre</b> <b>-tr-auto</b> PATTERN
           Automatically add links which target matches this pattern.

       <b>-tre</b> <b>-tr-auto-regex</b> REGEX
           Automatically add links which target matches this pattern.

       <b>-kd</b> <b>-keep-dirs</b> DIR
           A  list  of  directories,  that should not be removed when a package will be removed. <u>Warning:</u> Breaks
           compatibility with Stow!

       <b>-i</b> <b>-ignore</b> PATTERN
           Ignore files that matches this pattern.

       <b>-ire</b> <b>-ignore-regex</b> REGEX
           Ignore files that matches this expression.

       <b>-ni</b> <b>-nignore</b> PATTERN
           Ignore everything  except  file  and  directories  matching  this  expression.  eg:  "systree/bintree
           systree/headertree".   For  using  nignore  support  fnmatch  and configration file support has to be
           enabled. For more details see <b><a href="../man5/xstow.ini.5.html">xstow.ini</a></b>(5).

       <b>-cp</b> <b>-copy</b> PATTERN
           Copy files or directories that matching this pattern.

       <b>-cre</b> <b>-copy-regex</b> REGEX
           Copy files or directories that matching this expression.

       <b>-ifd</b> <b>-i-file-in-dir</b> DIR/FILE
           Ignore this file in this directory. (Relative to the package dir.)

       <b>-cfd</b> <b>-c-file-in-dir</b> DIR/FILE
           Copy this file in this directory. (Relative to the package dir.)

       <b>-sd</b> <b>-stow-dirs</b> DIR
           A list of other stow dirs, that xstow is allowed change

       <b>-sda</b> <b>-sd-auto</b> PATTERN
           Automatically add directories to the list when matching this expression.

       <b>-sde</b> <b>-sd-auto-regex</b> REGEX
           Automatically add directories to the list when matching this expression.

       <b>-pd</b> <b>-protect-dirs</b> DIR
           A list of other dirs, that xstow is not allowed change

       <b>-pda</b> <b>-pd-auto</b> PATTERN
           Automatically add directories to the list when matching this expression.

       <b>-pde</b> <b>-pd-auto-regex</b> REGEX
           Automatically add directories to the list when matching this expression.

       <b>-pdt</b> <b>-pd-targets</b> DIRS
           A list of dirs, xstow is allowed to change.

       <b>-pta</b> <b>-pdt-add-traversable</b> DIRS

       <b>-f</b> <b>-force</b>
           Skip conflicts if possible.

       <b>-F</b> <b>file</b>
           Read this configuration file too.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>0</b>   On success.

       <b>1</b>   On a missspelled call of xstow.

       <b>2</b>   If an internal error occoured.

       <b>3</b>   Installing the package failed of some reason. All the prechecking was ok, but the  execution  of  the
           exec list failed.

       <b>4</b>   Installing a package failed.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Since  the debugging of the command line parsing can be hard if the debugging level is set by the command
       line there are two evironment variables:

       <b>XSTOW_DEBUG_LEVEL</b>
           Same as the <b>-debug-level</b> option.

       <b>XSTOW_DEBUG_MODULE</b>
           Same as the <b>-debug-module</b> option.

           Both values will be overwritten by the settings of the command  line,  after  the  command  line  was
           parsed.

       <b>XSTOW_USE_CURSES</b>
           Same as the <b>-no-curses</b> option.

           In  later  versions  xstow  tried  detecting the terminal width and height, by default at the startup
           routine. Even if this value is only used by the help screen. The result was:

               $ TERM="" xstow
               Error opening terminal: unknown.

           The error message is reported by the ncurses lib. This can cause problems if you wan't start xstow as
           a cron job.  Now xstow tries detecting the terminal width not in it's  startup,  but  when  the  help
           screen  is  printed out. As an extra option you can set the environment variable <b>XSTOW_USE_CURSES</b>="0"
           this will tell xstow not using curses anyway.

</pre><h4><b>COFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file xstow.ini can be located in  <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>  and/or  in  the  current  stow  directory.  For
       possible settings and syntax of this file see <b><a href="../man5/xstow.ini.5.html">xstow.ini</a></b>(5)

       In  this  manpage there are some detailed informations of some special settings of XStow too. Please read
       it!

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Common</b> <b>Usage</b>
       As an example we install the ixlib library into the <a href="file:/usr/local/">/usr/local/</a> tree.

               tar xvfz ixlib-0.96.2.tar.gz
               cd ixlib-0.96.2
               ./configure
               make

       So far, this was business as usual.

       <u>Note:</u> by default the configure script prepares the application for being installed into <a href="file:/usr/local/.">/usr/local/.</a> Have
       a look at configure --help for more info.

       Now installation is done  by  not  installing  ixlib  directly  into  <a href="file:/usr/local/">/usr/local/</a>,  we  install  it  into
       /usr/local/stow/ixlib-0.96.2/.

               make install prefix=/usr/local/stow/ixlib-0.96.2/

       The  last  point  is  creating  all  necessare symlinks so that ixlib's include files can be found by the
       compiler in /usr/local/include. Therefore we are using xstow.

               cd /usr/local/stow
               xstow ixlib-0.96.2

       And all symlinks will be created.

   <b>Installing</b> <b>XStow</b> <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>XStow</b>
       After calling the configure script and make, XStow is installed into the stow directory as I showed it in
       the upper example.

               make install prefix=/usr/local/stow/xstow-0.1.0

       Then you switch to the stow directory and call XStow

               cd /usr/local/stow
               xstow-0.1.0/bin/xstow xstow-0.1.0

       That is it.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBLE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Link</b> <b>Creation</b>
       By default XStow is fully Stow compatible. The usage of some of the advanced features can cause that Stow
       cannot handle the tree any more.

   <b>Command</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Options</b>
       XStow supports all command line options of Stow. Even it's format.

       Eg.:      xstow --verbose=2 foobar

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There are some nitty gritty cases, but no known bugs.

</pre><h4><b>WHY</b></h4><pre>
       Stow requires Perl. But what's on systems where no Perl is available,  or  not  yet  installed?  I  tried
       compiling Stow with <b>perlcc</b>, but it failed.
