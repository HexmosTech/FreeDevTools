</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tabs — set terminal tabs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       tabs <b>[</b>-<u>n</u>|-a|-a2|-c|-c2|-c3|-f|-p|-s|-u<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-T <u>type</u><b>]</b>

       tabs <b>[</b>-T <u>type</u><b>]</b> <u>n</u><b>[[</b><u>sep</u><b>[</b>+<b>]</b><u>n</u><b>]</b>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>tabs</u>  utility  shall  display  a  series  of  characters that first clears the hardware terminal tab
       settings and then initializes the tab stops at the specified positions and optionally adjusts the margin.

       The phrase ``tab-stop position <u>N</u>'' shall be taken to mean that, from the  start  of  a  line  of  output,
       tabbing  to position <u>N</u> shall cause the next character output to be in the (<u>N</u>+1)th column position on that
       line. The maximum number of tab stops allowed is terminal-dependent.

       It need not be possible to implement <u>tabs</u> on certain terminals. If the terminal type  obtained  from  the
       <u>TERM</u>  environment  variable  or  <b>-T</b>  option represents such a terminal, an appropriate diagnostic message
       shall be written to standard error and <u>tabs</u> shall exit with a status greater than zero.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>tabs</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>, except for various extensions: the options <b>-a2</b>, <b>-c2</b>, and <b>-c3</b> are multi-character.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-</b><u>n</u>        Specify repetitive tab stops separated by a uniform number of column positions, <u>n</u>, where <u>n</u> is a
                 single-digit decimal number. The default usage of <u>tabs</u> with no arguments shall be equivalent to
                 <u>tabs</u> -8. When <b>-0</b> is used, the tab stops shall be cleared and no new ones set.

       <b>-a</b>        1,10,16,36,72
                 Assembler, applicable to some mainframes.

       <b>-a2</b>       1,10,16,40,72
                 Assembler, applicable to some mainframes.

       <b>-c</b>        1,8,12,16,20,55
                 COBOL, normal format.

       <b>-c2</b>       1,6,10,14,49
                 COBOL, compact format (columns 1 to 6 omitted).

       <b>-c3</b>       1,6,10,14,18,22,26,30,34,38,42,46,50,54,58,62,67
                 COBOL compact format (columns 1 to 6 omitted), with more tabs than <b>-c2</b>.

       <b>-f</b>        1,7,11,15,19,23
                 FORTRAN

       <b>-p</b>        1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,37,41,45,49,53,57,61
                 PL/1

       <b>-s</b>        1,10,55
                 SNOBOL

       <b>-u</b>        1,12,20,44
                 Assembler, applicable to some mainframes.

       <b>-T</b> <u>type</u>   Indicate the type of terminal. If this option is not supplied and the <u>TERM</u> variable is unset or
                 null,  an  unspecified  default  terminal  type  shall  be used. The setting of <u>type</u> shall take
                 precedence over the value in <u>TERM</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>n</u><b>[[</b><u>sep</u><b>[</b>+<b>]</b><u>n</u><b>]</b>...<b>]</b>
                 A single command line argument that consists of one or more tab-stop values (<u>n</u>) separated by  a
                 separator  character  (<u>sep</u>)  which  is either a &lt;comma&gt; or a &lt;blank&gt; character. The application
                 shall ensure that the tab-stop values are  positive  decimal  integers  in  strictly  ascending
                 order.  If  any tab-stop value (except the first one) is preceded by a &lt;plus-sign&gt;, it is taken
                 as an increment to be added to the previous value. For example, the tab  lists  1,10,20,30  and
                 <b>"1</b>10<b>+10</b>+10" are considered to be identical.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>tabs</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>TERM</u>      Determine the terminal type. If this variable is unset or null, and if the  <b>-T</b>  option  is  not
                 specified, an unspecified default terminal type shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       If  standard output is a terminal, the appropriate sequence to clear and set the tab stops may be written
       to standard output in an unspecified format. If standard output is  not  a  terminal,  undefined  results
       occur.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       This utility makes use of the terminal's hardware tabs and the <u>stty</u> <u>tabs</u> option.

       This utility is not recommended for application use.

       Some  integrated  display  units  might  not  have  escape  sequences to set tab stops, but may be set by
       internal system calls. On these terminals, <u>tabs</u> works if standard output is directed to the terminal;  if
       output is directed to another file, however, <u>tabs</u> fails.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Consideration  was  given  to  having  the  <u>tput</u>  utility  handle all of the functions described in <u>tabs</u>.
       However, the separate <u>tabs</u> utility was retained because it seems more intuitive to use  a  command  named
       <u>tabs</u>  than  <u>tput</u>  with  a  new option. The <u>tput</u> utility does not support setting or clearing tabs, and no
       known historical version of <u>tabs</u> supports the capability of setting arbitrary tab stops.

       The System V <u>tabs</u> interface is very complex; the version in this volume of  POSIX.1‐2017  has  a  reduced
       feature  list,  but  many of the features omitted were restored as part of the XSI option even though the
       supported languages and coding styles are primarily historical.

       There was considerable sentiment for specifying only a means of resetting the tabs back to a known state—
       presumably the ``standard'' of tabs every eight positions. The following features were omitted:

        *  Setting tab stops via the first line in a file, using --<u>file</u>.  Since even the SVID  has  no  complete
           explanation of this feature, it is doubtful that it is in widespread use.

       In  an  early proposal, a <b>-t</b> <u>tablist</u> option was added for consistency with <u>expand</u>; this was later removed
       when inconsistencies with the historical list of tabs were identified.

       Consideration was given to adding a <b>-p</b> option that would output the current tab  settings  so  that  they
       could  be  saved  and  then  later  restored. This was not accepted because querying the tab stops of the
       terminal is not a capability in historical <u>terminfo</u> or <u>termcap</u> facilities and might not be supported on a
       wide range of terminals.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
