</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       curl-config - Get information about a libcurl installation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>curl-config</b> <b>[options]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>curl-config</b> displays information about the curl and libcurl installation.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --ca   Displays the built-in path to the CA cert bundle this libcurl uses.

       --cc   Displays the compiler used to build libcurl.

       --cflags
              Set  of  compiler options (CFLAGS) to use when compiling files that use libcurl. Currently that is
              only the include path to the curl include files.

       --checkfor [version]
              Specify the oldest possible libcurl version string you want, and this  script  returns  0  if  the
              current  installation  is  new  enough  or it returns 1 and outputs a text saying that the current
              version is not new enough. (Added in 7.15.4)

       --configure
              Displays the arguments given to configure when building curl.

       --feature
              Lists what particular main features the installed libcurl was built with. At the time of  writing,
              this  list  may  include  SSL,  KRB4 or IPv6. Do not assume any particular order. The keywords are
              separated by newlines. There may be none, one, or several keywords in the list.

       --help Displays the available options.

       --libs Shows the complete set of libs and other linker options you need in order to link your application
              with libcurl.

       --prefix
              This is the prefix used when libcurl was installed. libcurl is then installed in  $prefix/lib  and
              its  header  files  are  installed in $prefix/include and so on. The prefix is set with "configure
              --prefix".

       --protocols
              Lists what particular protocols the installed libcurl  was  built  to  support.  At  the  time  of
              writing,  this list may include HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, FILE, TELNET, LDAP, DICT and many more. Do
              not assume any particular order. The protocols are listed using uppercase  and  are  separated  by
              newlines. There may be none, one, or several protocols in the list. (Added in 7.13.0)

       --ssl-backends
              Lists  the  SSL  backends that were enabled when libcurl was built. It might be no, one or several
              names. If more than one name, they appear comma-separated.  (Added in 7.58.0)

       --static-libs
              Shows the complete set of libs and other linker options you need in order to link your application
              with libcurl statically. (Added in 7.17.1)

       --version
              Outputs version information about the installed libcurl.

       --vernum
              Outputs version information about the installed  libcurl,  in  numerical  mode.   This  shows  the
              version  number, in hexadecimal, using 8 bits for each part: major, minor, and patch numbers. This
              makes libcurl 7.7.4 appear as 070704 and libcurl  12.13.14  appear  as  0c0d0e...  Note  that  the
              initial zero might be omitted. (This option was broken in the 7.15.0 release.)
