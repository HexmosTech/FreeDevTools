</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       accel-config-config-wq - configure individual attributes of a work queue

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>accel-config</u> <u>config-wq</u> <u>&lt;device</u> <u>name&gt;/&lt;wq</u> <u>name&gt;</u> <u>[&lt;options&gt;]</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       accel-config config-wq dsa0/wq0.0 --wq-size=16

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -g, --group-id=
           specify the group id used by work queue, group id should be between 0 and the maximum number of
           groups per device. A group id of -1 disassociates the work queue from a group.

       -s, --wq-size=
           specify work queue size used by a work queue. The wq-size should be between 0 and the maximum
           workqueue size exposed by the device in the max_work_queue_size attribute under device.

       -p, --priority
           specify the priority of this work queue relative to other work queues in the same group. This field
           ranges from 1 to 15 where the larger value means higher priority. For example, if wq1 has a priority
           of 6 and wq2 has priority of 2, wq1 will issue 3 times as many descriptors to the engine compare to
           wq2.

       -b, --block-on-fault
           toggle block on fault enable for the work queue. block-on-fault should be either 0 or 1. If block on
           fault is disabled, if a page fault occurs on a source or destination memory access, the operation
           stops and the page fault is reported to the software.

       -t, --threshold
           configure the threshold for the wq. The set up threshold value should be larger than 0 and only for
           "shared" wq, and note that the configured threshold value should be at least 1 less than the
           configured wq-size value. The reason is threshold is set for unprivileged users, and need to reserve
           at least 1 space for the privileged user for commands.

       -y, --type
           configure the type for the wq. The wq type can be "kernel" for kernel user case to request wq or
           "user" for regular character device driver use case to wq.

       -n, --name
           configure the name for the wq. This can be any string defined by the user. Typically it is used for
           identifying the wq in some unique way. A possible suggestion would be using a uuid string.

       -d, --driver-name
           specify the name of the driver to bind. This should be one of the valid wq drivers found in
           /sys/bus/dsa/drivers

       -o, --op-config
           specify the op config bitmask. The bitmask is of size 256 bits and entered as 32 bit hex words
           separated by comma or space. e.g.
           00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,00fc00ff,003f03ff

       -m, --mode
           configure the mode for the wq. The wq mode can be set as "dedicated" or "shared".

       -c, --max-batch-size
           specify the max batch size used by a work queue. The value should be between 1 and the device maximum
           batch size found in the max_batch_size attribute under device. If the value is not a power of 2, it
           will be rounded up to the next power of 2.

       -x, --max-transfer-size
           specify the max transfer size used by a work queue. The value should be between 1 and the device
           maximum transfer size found in the max_transfer_size attribute under device. If the value is not a
           power of 2, it will be rounded up to the next power of 2.

       -a, --ats-disable
           toggle whether ATS disable is turned on for the work queue. The value should be either 0 or 1. 0
           indicates ATS is on, and 1 indicates ATS is off for the work queue.

       -r, --prs-disable
           toggle whether PRS disable is turned on for the work queue. The value should be either 0 or 1. 0
           indicates PRS is on, and 1 indicates PRS is off for the work queue.
