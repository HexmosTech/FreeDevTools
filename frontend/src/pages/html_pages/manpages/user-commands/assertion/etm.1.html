</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>etm</b> - manage events and tasks using simple text files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         <b>etm</b> [<u>logging</u> <u>level</u>] [<u>path</u>] [?] [<u>acmsv</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       With  no arguments, <b>etm</b> will use settings from the configuration file <a href="file:~/.etm/etmtk.cfg">~/.etm/etmtk.cfg</a>, set <u>logging</u> <u>level</u>
       3 (warn) and open the GUI.

       if the first argument is an integer not less than 1 (debug) and not greater than 5 (critical),  then  <b>etm</b>
       will use that <u>logging</u> <u>level</u> and remove the argument.

       If  the  first  (remaining) argument is the <u>path</u> to a directory which contains a file named etm.cfg, then
       <b>etm</b> will use that configuration file and remove the argument.

       If the first (remaining) argument is one of  the  commands  listed  below,  then  <b>etm</b>  will  execute  the
       remaining arguments without opening the GUI.

           a ARG   display the agenda view using ARG, if given, as a filter.
           k ARG   display the keywords view using ARG, if given, as a filter.
           n ARGS  Create a new item using the remaining arguments
                   as the item specification.
           m INT   display a report using the remaining argument, which must be a
                   positive integer, to display a report using the corresponding
                   entry from the file given by report_specifications in etmtk.cfg.
                   Use ? m to display the numbered list of entries from this file.
           p ARG   display the path view using ARG, if given, as a filter.
           r ARGS  display a report using the remaining arguments as the
                   report specification.
           s ARG   display the schedule view using ARG, if given, as a filter.
           t ARG   display the tags view using ARG, if given, as a filter.
           v       display information about etm and the operating system.
           ? ARGS  display (this) command line help information if ARGS = '' or,
                   if ARGS = X where X is one of the above commands, then display
                   details about command X. 'X ?' is equivalent to '? X'.

   <b>DATA</b> <b>FILES</b>
       Data items begin with a data type character and continue on one or more lines either until the end of the
       file  is reached or another line is found that begins with a type character. Data type characters and the
       associated data types:

       <b>~</b>      Action: a record of time and/or money spent.

       <b>*</b>      Event: happens on a particular date and time.

       <b>^</b>      Occasion: happens on a particular date, e.g., a  holiday, anniversary or birthday.

       <b>!</b>      Note: a record of some useful information.

       <b>-</b>      Task: something that needs to be done.

       <b>%</b>      Delegated task: a task assigned to someone else.

       <b>+</b>      Task group: a group of related tasks, some of which may be prerequisites for others.

       <b>$</b>      Inbasket: quick entry to be edited later when time permits.

       <b>?</b>      Someday maybe: remember but don't show in the common views.

       <b>#</b>      Hidden: remember but hide from all <b>etm</b> views except <u>path</u> view.

       <b>=</b>      Defaults: set default options for subsequent entries in the same data file.

       The beginning data type character for each item is followed by the item summary and then, perhaps, by one
       or more '@key value' option pairs. Examples:

       •  A sales meeting (an event) a week from today from 9:00am until 10:00am with a 5 minute  early  warning
          alert:

           * sales meeting @s +7 9a @e 1h @a 5

       •  Prepare a report (a task) for the meeting beginning 3 days early:

           - prepare report @s +7 @b 3

       •  A 35 minute period (an action) spent working on the report yesterday:

           ~ report preparation @s -1 @e 35

       •  Get  a  haircut (a task) on the 24th of the current month and then [r]epeatedly at (d)aily [i]ntervals
          of 14 days and, [o]n completion, (r)estart from the completion date:

           - get haircut @s 24 @r d &amp;i 14 @o r

       •  Do the jobs in the following task group in 'q' order to finish the dog house project:

                 @j cut pieces &amp;q 2
                 @j assemble &amp;q 3
                 @j paint &amp;q 4

       •  Payday (an occassion) on the last week day of each month. The '&amp;s' part of the entry extracts the last
          date which is both a weekday and falls within the last three days of the month.):

           ^ payday @s 1/1 @r m &amp;w (MO, TU, WE, TH, FR) &amp;m (-1, -2, -3) &amp;s -1

       •  Take a prescribed medication daily (a reminder) for the next three days at 10am, 2pm, 6pm and 10pm and
          trigger the default alert zero minutes before each event:

                 @r y &amp;i 4 &amp;M 11 &amp;m range(2,9) &amp;w TU

       •  Join  the  <b>etm</b>  discussion  group  (a  task).  Because of the @g (goto) link, pressing Ctrl-G when the
          details of this item are  displayed  in  the  gui  would  open  the  link  using  the  system  default
          application:
