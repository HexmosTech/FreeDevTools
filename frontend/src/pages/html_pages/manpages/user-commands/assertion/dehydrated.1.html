</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dehydrated - ACME client implemented as a shell-script

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dehydrated</b> [<b>command</b> [<b>argument</b>]] [<b>argument</b> [<b>argument</b>]] <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  client  for  ACME-based  Certificate  Authorities, such as LetsEncrypt.  It can be used to request and
       obtain TLS certificates from an ACME-based certificate authority.

       Before any certificates can be requested, Dehydrated needs to acquire an  account  with  the  Certificate
       Authorities. Optionally, an email address can be provided.  It will be used to e.g. notify about expiring
       certificates.  You will usually need to accept the Terms of Service of the CA.  Dehydrated will notify if
       no account is configured. Run with <b>--register</b> <b>--accept-terms</b> to create a new account.

       Next, all domain names must be provided in domains.txt. The format is line based: If  the  file  contains
       two lines "example.com" and "example.net", dehydrated will request two certificate, one for "example.com"
       and the other for "example.net". A single line containing "example.com example.net" will request a single
       certificate  valid  for  both  "example.net" and "example.com" through the <u>Subject</u> <u>Alternative</u> <u>Name</u> (SAN)
       field.

       For the next step, one way of verifying  domain  name  ownership  needs  to  be  configured.   Dehydrated
       implements <u>http-01</u> and <u>dns-01</u> verification.

       The <u>http-01</u> verification provides proof of ownership by providing a challenge token. In order to do that,
       the  directory  referenced in the <u>WELLKNOWN</u> config variable needs to be exposed at <u>http://{domain}/.well-</u>
       <u>known/acme-challenge/</u>, where {domain} is every domain name specified in <u>domains.txt</u>.  Dehydrated does not
       provide its own challenge responder, but relies on an  existing  web  server  to  provide  the  challenge
       response.  See <u>wellknown.md</u> for configuration examples of popular web servers.

       The <u>dns-01</u> verification works by providing a challenge token through DNS.  This is especially interesting
       for  hosts  that  cannot  be  exposed  to  the  public  Internet.  Because adding records to DNS zones is
       oftentimes highly specific to the software or the DNS provider at hand, there are many third party  hooks
       available for dehydrated.  See <u>dns-verification.md</u> for hooks for popular DNS servers and DNS hosters.

       Finally, the certificates need to be requested and updated on a regular basis.  This can happen through a
       cron job or a timer. Initially, you may enforce this by invoking <u>dehydrated</u> <u>-c</u> manually.

       After  a successful run, certificates are stored in <u>/etc/dehydrated/certs/{domain}</u>, where {domain} is the
       domain name in the first column of <u>domains.txt</u>.
