</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nohup — invoke a utility immune to hangups

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       nohup <u>utility</u> <b>[</b><u>argument</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>nohup</u>  utility  shall invoke the utility named by the <u>utility</u> operand with arguments supplied as the
       <u>argument</u> operands. At the time the named <u>utility</u> is invoked,  the  SIGHUP  signal  shall  be  set  to  be
       ignored.

       If  standard  input  is associated with a terminal, the <u>nohup</u> utility may redirect standard input from an
       unspecified file.

       If the standard output is a terminal, all output written by the named  <u>utility</u>  to  its  standard  output
       shall  be  appended  to  the  end  of the file <b>nohup.out</b> in the current directory. If <b>nohup.out</b> cannot be
       created or opened for appending, the output shall be appended to the end of the  file  <b>nohup.out</b>  in  the
       directory  specified  by  the  <u>HOME</u>  environment  variable.  If neither file can be created or opened for
       appending, <u>utility</u> shall not be invoked. If a file is created, the file's permission bits shall be set to
       S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR.

       If standard error is a terminal and standard output is open but is not a terminal, all output written  by
       the  named  utility  to  its  standard error shall be redirected to the same open file description as the
       standard output. If standard error is a terminal and standard output either is a terminal or  is  closed,
       the same output shall instead be appended to the end of the <b>nohup.out</b> file as described above.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>utility</u>   The  name  of  a utility that is to be invoked. If the <u>utility</u> operand names any of the special
                 built-in utilities in <u>Section</u> <u>2.14</u>, <u>Special</u> <u>Built-In</u> <u>Utilities</u>, the results are undefined.

       <u>argument</u>  Any string to be supplied as an argument  when  invoking  the  utility  named  by  the  <u>utility</u>
                 operand.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>nohup</u>:

       <u>HOME</u>      Determine  the  pathname  of  the user's home directory: if the output file <b>nohup.out</b> cannot be
                 created in the current directory, the <u>nohup</u> utility shall use the directory named  by  <u>HOME</u>  to
                 create the file.

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>PATH</u>      Determine the search path that is used to locate the  utility  to  be  invoked.  See  the  Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>8</u>, <u>Environment</u> <u>Variables</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>nohup</u> utility shall take the standard action for all signals except that SIGHUP shall be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  standard  output  is  not  a terminal, the standard output of <u>nohup</u> shall be the standard output
       generated by the execution of the <u>utility</u> specified by the operands. Otherwise, nothing shall be  written
       to the standard output.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  standard  output is a terminal, a message shall be written to the standard error, indicating the
       name of the file to which the output is being appended. The name of the file shall be either <b>nohup.out</b> or
       <b>$HOME/nohup.out</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Output written by the named utility is appended to  the  file  <b>nohup.out</b>  (or  <b>$HOME/nohup.out</b>),  if  the
       conditions hold as described in the DESCRIPTION.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

       126     The utility specified by <u>utility</u> was found but could not be invoked.

       127     An error occurred in the <u>nohup</u> utility or the utility specified by <u>utility</u> could not be found.

       Otherwise, the exit status of <u>nohup</u> shall be that of the utility specified by the <u>utility</u> operand.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>command</u>,  <u>env</u>, <u>nice</u>, <u>nohup</u>, <u>time</u>, and <u>xargs</u> utilities have been specified to use exit code 127 if an
       error occurs so that applications can distinguish ``failure to find a utility''  from  ``invoked  utility
       exited  with  an  error  indication''. The value 127 was chosen because it is not commonly used for other
       meanings; most utilities use small values for ``normal error conditions'' and the values above 128 can be
       confused with termination due to receipt of a signal. The value 126 was chosen in  a  similar  manner  to
       indicate that the utility could be found, but not invoked. Some scripts produce meaningful error messages
       differentiating  the  126  and  127  cases.  The  distinction  between exit codes 126 and 127 is based on
       KornShell practice that uses 127 when all attempts to <u>exec</u> the utility fail with <b>[ENOENT]</b>, and  uses  126
       when any attempt to <u>exec</u> the utility fails for any other reason.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       It  is frequently desirable to apply <u>nohup</u> to pipelines or lists of commands. This can be done by placing
       pipelines and command lists in a single file; this file can then be invoked as a utility, and  the  <u>nohup</u>
       applies to everything in the file.

       Alternatively, the following command can be used to apply <u>nohup</u> to a complex command:

           nohup sh -c '<u>complex-command-line</u>' &lt;/dev/null

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  4.3  BSD  version ignores SIGTERM and SIGHUP, and if <b>./nohup.out</b> cannot be used, it fails instead of
       trying to use <b>$HOME/nohup.out</b>.

       The <u>csh</u> utility has a built-in version of <u>nohup</u> that acts differently from  the  <u>nohup</u>  defined  in  this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       The  term  <u>utility</u>  is  used,  rather  than  <u>command</u>, to highlight the fact that shell compound commands,
       pipelines, special built-ins, and so on,  cannot  be  used  directly.   However,  <u>utility</u>  includes  user
       application programs and shell scripts, not just the standard utilities.

       Historical  versions  of the <u>nohup</u> utility use default file creation semantics. Some more recent versions
       use the permissions specified here as an added security precaution.

       Some historical implementations ignore SIGQUIT in addition to SIGHUP; others  ignore  SIGTERM.  An  early
       proposal  allowed,  but  did  not  require,  SIGQUIT to be ignored. Several reviewers objected that <u>nohup</u>
       should only modify the handling of SIGHUP as required by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       Historical versions of <u>nohup</u> did not affect standard input,  but  that  causes  problems  in  the  common
       scenario where the user logs into a system, types the command:

           nohup make &amp;

       at  the  prompt, and then logs out. If standard input is not affected by <u>nohup</u>, the login session may not
       terminate for quite some time, since standard input remains open until <u>make</u> exits. To avoid this problem,
       POSIX.1‐2008 allows implementations to redirect standard input if it is a terminal. Since the behavior is
       implementation-defined, portable applications that may run into  the  problem  should  redirect  standard
       input themselves. For example, instead of:

           nohup make &amp;

       an application can invoke:

           nohup make &lt;/dev/null &amp;
