</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gdc - A GCC-based compiler for the D language

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       gdc [<b>-c</b>|<b>-S</b>] [<b>-g</b>] [<b>-pg</b>]
           [<b>-O</b><u>level</u>] [<b>-W</b><u>warn</u>...]
           [<b>-I</b><u>dir</u>...] [<b>-L</b><u>dir</u>...]
           [<b>-f</b><u>option</u>...] [<b>-m</b><u>machine-option</u>...]
           [<b>-o</b> <u>outfile</u>] [@<u>file</u>] <u>infile</u>...

       Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the remainder.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>gdc</b> command is the GNU compiler for the D language and supports many of the same options as <b>gcc</b>.
       This manual only documents the options specific to <b>gdc</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Input</b> <b>and</b> <b>Output</b> <b>files</b>
       For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of compilation is done.  The
       following kinds of input file names are supported:

       <u>file</u><b>.d</b>
           D source files.

       <u>file</u><b>.dd</b>
           Ddoc source files.

       <u>file</u><b>.di</b>
           D interface files.

       You  can  specify more than one input file on the <b>gdc</b> command line, each being compiled separately in the
       compilation process.  If you specify a "-o <u>file</u>" option, all  the  input  files  are  compiled  together,
       producing a single output file, named <u>file</u>.  This is allowed even when using "-S" or "-c".

       A D interface file contains only what an import of the module needs, rather than the whole implementation
       of  that  module.   They  can  be created by <b>gdc</b> from a D source file by using the "-H" option.  When the
       compiler resolves an import declaration, it searches for matching <u>.di</u> files first, then for <u>.d</u>.

       A Ddoc source file contains code in the D macro processor language.  It is primarily designed for use  in
       producing  user documentation from embedded comments, with a slight affinity towards HTML generation.  If
       a <u>.d</u> source file starts with the string "Ddoc" then it is treated as general purpose  documentation,  not
       as a D source file.

   <b>Runtime</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options affect the runtime behavior of programs compiled with <b>gdc</b>.

       <b>-fall-instantiations</b>
           Generate  code  for  all  template  instantiations.  The default template emission strategy is to not
           generate  code  for  declarations  that  were  either  instantiated  speculatively,  such   as   from
           "__traits(compiles, ...)", or that come from an imported module not being compiled.

       <b>-fno-assert</b>
           Turn off code generation for "assert" contracts.

       <b>-fno-bounds-check</b>
           Turns  off  array bounds checking for all functions, which can improve performance for code that uses
           arrays extensively.  Note that this can result in unpredictable behavior  if  the  code  in  question
           actually  does  violate array bounds constraints.  It is safe to use this option if you are sure that
           your code never throws a "RangeError".

       <b>-fbounds-check=</b><u>value</u>
           An alternative to <b>-fbounds-check</b> that allows more control as to where bounds checking is turned on or
           off.  The following values are supported:

           <b>on</b>  Turns on array bounds checking for all functions.

           <b>safeonly</b>
               Turns on array bounds checking only for @safe functions.

           <b>off</b> Turns off array bounds checking completely.

       <b>-fno-builtin</b>
           Don't recognize built-in functions unless they begin with the prefix  <b>__builtin_</b>.   By  default,  the
           compiler will recognize when a function in the "core.stdc" package is a built-in function.

       <b>-fcheckaction=</b><u>value</u>
           This  option  controls what code is generated on an assertion, bounds check, or final switch failure.
           The following values are supported:

           <b>context</b>
               Throw an "AssertError" with extra context information.

           <b>halt</b>
               Halt the program execution.

           <b>throw</b>
               Throw an "AssertError" (the default).

       <b>-fdebug</b>
       <b>-fdebug=</b><u>value</u>
           Turn on compilation of conditional "debug" code into the program.  The <b>-fdebug</b> option itself sets the
           debug level to 1, while <b>-fdebug=</b> enables "debug" code that are identified by  any  of  the  following
           values:

           <b>ident</b>
               Turns on compilation of any "debug" code identified by <u>ident</u>.

       <b>-fno-druntime</b>
           Implements  &lt;<b>https://dlang.org/spec/betterc.html</b>&gt;.   Assumes  that compilation targets an environment
           without a D runtime library.

           This is equivalent to compiling with the following options:

                   gdc -nophoboslib -fno-exceptions -fno-moduleinfo -fno-rtti

       <b>-fextern-std=</b><u>standard</u>
           Sets the C++ name mangling compatibility to the version identified by <u>standard</u>.  The following values
           are supported:

           <b>c++98</b>
           <b>c++03</b>
               Sets "__traits(getTargetInfo, "cppStd")" to 199711.

           <b>c++11</b>
               Sets "__traits(getTargetInfo, "cppStd")" to 201103.

           <b>c++14</b>
               Sets "__traits(getTargetInfo, "cppStd")" to 201402.

           <b>c++17</b>
               Sets "__traits(getTargetInfo, "cppStd")" to 201703.  This is the default.

           <b>c++20</b>
               Sets "__traits(getTargetInfo, "cppStd")" to 202002.

       <b>-fno-invariants</b>
           Turns off code generation for class "invariant" contracts.

       <b>-fmain</b>
           Generates a default main() function when compiling.  This is useful when unittesting a library, as it
           enables running the unittests in a library without having to manually define an entry-point function.
           This option does nothing when "main" is already defined in user code.

       <b>-fno-moduleinfo</b>
           Turns off generation of the "ModuleInfo" and related functions that would become unreferenced without
           it, which may allow linking to programs not written in  D.   Functions  that  are  not  be  generated
           include  module constructors and destructors ("static this" and "static ~this"), "unittest" code, and
           "DSO" registry functions for dynamically linked code.

       <b>-fonly=</b><u>filename</u>
           Tells the compiler to parse and run semantic analysis on all modules on the command  line,  but  only
           generate code for the module specified by <u>filename</u>.

       <b>-fno-postconditions</b>
           Turns off code generation for postcondition "out" contracts.

       <b>-fno-preconditions</b>
           Turns off code generation for precondition "in" contracts.

       <b>-fpreview=</b><u>id</u>
           Turns on an upcoming D language change identified by <u>id</u>.  The following values are supported:

           <b>all</b> Turns on all upcoming D language features.

           <b>bitfields</b>
               Implements bit-fields in D.

           <b>dip1000</b>
               Implements &lt;<b>https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/other/DIP1000.md</b>&gt; (Scoped pointers).

           <b>dip1008</b>
               Implements &lt;<b>https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/other/DIP1008.md</b>&gt; (Allow exceptions in
               @nogc code).

           <b>dip1021</b>
               Implements &lt;<b>https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/accepted/DIP1021.md</b>&gt; (Mutable function
               arguments).

           <b>dip25</b>
               Implements &lt;<b>https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/archive/DIP25.md</b>&gt; (Sealed references).

           <b>dtorfields</b>
               Turns on generation for destructing fields of partially constructed objects.

           <b>fieldwise</b>
               Turns on generation of struct equality to use field-wise comparisons.

           <b>fixaliasthis</b>
               Implements  new  lookup  rules  that check the current scope for "alias this" before searching in
               upper scopes.

           <b>fiximmutableconv</b>
               Disallows unsound immutable conversions that were formerly incorrectly permitted.

           <b>in</b>  Implements "in" parameters to mean "scope const [ref]" and accepts rvalues.

           <b>inclusiveincontracts</b>
               Implements "in" contracts of overridden methods to be a superset of parent contract.

           <b>nosharedaccess</b>
               Turns off and disallows all access to shared memory objects.

           <b>rvaluerefparam</b>
               Implements rvalue arguments to "ref" parameters.

           <b>systemvariables</b>
               Disables access to variables marked @system from @safe code.

       <b>-frelease</b>
           Turns on compiling in release mode, which  means  not  emitting  runtime  checks  for  contracts  and
           asserts.   Array  bounds  checking  is  not  done  for  @system and @trusted functions, and assertion
           failures are undefined behavior.

           This is equivalent to compiling with the following options:

                   gdc -fno-assert -fbounds-check=safe -fno-invariants \
                       -fno-postconditions -fno-preconditions -fno-switch-errors

       <b>-frevert=</b>
           Turns off a D language feature identified by <u>id</u>.  The following values are supported:

           <b>all</b> Turns off all revertable D language features.

           <b>dip1000</b>
               Reverts &lt;<b>https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/other/DIP1000.md</b>&gt; (Scoped pointers).

           <b>dip25</b>
               Reverts &lt;<b>https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/archive/DIP25.md</b>&gt; (Sealed references).

           <b>dtorfields</b>
               Turns off generation for destructing fields of partially constructed objects.

           <b>intpromote</b>
               Turns off C-style integral promotion for unary "+", "-" and "~" expressions.

       <b>-fno-rtti</b>
           Turns off generation of run-time type information for all user defined types.   Any  code  that  uses
           features of the language that require access to this information will result in an error.

       <b>-fno-switch-errors</b>
           This  option  controls  what code is generated when no case is matched in a "final switch" statement.
           The default run time behavior is to throw a "SwitchError".  Turning off  <b>-fswitch-errors</b>  means  that
           instead the execution of the program is immediately halted.

       <b>-funittest</b>
           Turns on compilation of "unittest" code, and turns on the version(unittest) identifier.  This implies
           <b>-fassert</b>.

       <b>-fversion=</b><u>value</u>
           Turns  on  compilation  of  conditional  "version"  code  into  the  program identified by any of the
           following values:

           <b>ident</b>
               Turns on compilation of "version" code identified by <u>ident</u>.

       <b>-fno-weak-templates</b>
           Turns off emission of declarations that can be defined in multiple  objects  as  weak  symbols.   The
           default  is  to  emit  all  public symbols as weak, unless the target lacks support for weak symbols.
           Disabling this option means that common symbols are instead put in COMDAT or become private.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Search</b>
       These options specify directories to search for files, libraries, and other parts of the compiler:

       <b>-I</b><u>dir</u>
           Specify a directory to use when searching for imported modules at compile time.  Multiple <b>-I</b>  options
           can be used, and the paths are searched in the same order.

       <b>-J</b><u>dir</u>
           Specify  a  directory to use when searching for files in string imports at compile time.  This switch
           is required in order to use import(file) expressions.  Multiple <b>-J</b> options can be used, and the paths
           are searched in the same order.

       <b>-L</b><u>dir</u>
           When linking, specify a library search directory, as with <b>gcc</b>.

       <b>-B</b><u>dir</u>
           This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries, source files, and data files  of  the
           compiler itself, as with <b>gcc</b>.

       <b>-fmodule-file=</b><u>module</u><b>=</b><u>spec</u>
           This  option  manipulates file paths of imported modules, such that if an imported module matches all
           or the leftmost part of <u>module</u>, the file path in <u>spec</u> is  used  as  the  location  to  search  for  D
           sources.  This is used when the source file path and names are not the same as the package and module
           hierarchy.  Consider the following examples:

                   gdc test.d -fmodule-file=A.B=foo.d -fmodule-file=C=bar

           This  will  tell  the compiler to search in all import paths for the source file <u>foo.d</u> when importing
           <u>A.B</u>, and the directory <u>bar/</u> when importing <u>C</u>, as annotated in the following D code:

                   module test;
                   import A.B;     // Matches A.B, searches for foo.d
                   import C.D.E;   // Matches C, searches for bar/D/E.d
                   import A.B.C;   // No match, searches for A/B/C.d

       <b>-imultilib</b> <u>dir</u>
           Use <u>dir</u> as a subdirectory of the gcc directory containing target-specific D sources and interfaces.

       <b>-iprefix</b> <u>prefix</u>
           Specify <u>prefix</u> as the  prefix  for  the  gcc  directory  containing  target-specific  D  sources  and
           interfaces.  If the <u>prefix</u> represents a directory, you should include the final '/'.

       <b>-nostdinc</b>
           Do not search the standard system directories for D source and interface files.  Only the directories
           that  have been specified with <b>-I</b> options (and the directory of the current file, if appropriate) are
           searched.

   <b>Code</b> <b>Generation</b>
       In addition to the many <b>gcc</b> options controlling code generation, <b>gdc</b>  has  several  options  specific  to
       itself.

       <b>-H</b>  Generates  D interface files for all modules being compiled.  The compiler determines the output file
           based on the name of the input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and applies the <u>.di</u>
           suffix.

       <b>-Hd</b> <u>dir</u>
           Same as <b>-H</b>, but writes interface files to directory <u>dir</u>.  This option can be used with  <b>-Hf</b>  <u>file</u>  to
           independently set the output file and directory path.

       <b>-Hf</b> <u>file</u>
           Same as <b>-H</b> but writes interface files to <u>file</u>.  This option can be used with <b>-Hd</b> <u>dir</u> to independently
           set the output file and directory path.

       <b>-M</b>  Output the module dependencies of all source files being compiled in a format suitable for <b>make</b>.  The
           compiler outputs one <b>make</b> rule containing the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the
           names of all imported files.

       <b>-MM</b> Like <b>-M</b> but does not mention imported modules from the D standard library package directories.

       <b>-MF</b> <u>file</u>
           When  used  with <b>-M</b> or <b>-MM</b>, specifies a <u>file</u> to write the dependencies to.  When used with the driver
           options <b>-MD</b> or <b>-MMD</b>, <b>-MF</b> overrides the default dependency output file.

       <b>-MG</b> This option is for compatibility with <b>gcc</b>, and is ignored by the compiler.

       <b>-MP</b> Outputs a phony target for each dependency other than the modules being  compiled,  causing  each  to
           depend on nothing.

       <b>-MT</b> <u>target</u>
           Change  the <u>target</u> of the rule emitted by dependency generation to be exactly the string you specify.
           If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single argument to <b>-MT</b>, or use  multiple  <b>-MT</b>
           options.

       <b>-MQ</b> <u>target</u>
           Same as <b>-MT</b>, but it quotes any characters which are special to <b>make</b>.

       <b>-MD</b> This  option  is  equivalent  to  <b>-M</b>  <b>-MF</b> <u>file</u>.  The driver determines <u>file</u> by removing any directory
           components and suffix from the input file, and then adding a <u>.deps</u> suffix.

       <b>-MMD</b>
           Like <b>-MD</b> but does not mention imported modules from the D standard library package directories.

       <b>-X</b>  Output information describing the contents of all source files being compiled in  JSON  format  to  a
           file.   The  driver  determines  <u>file</u>  by removing any directory components and suffix from the input
           file, and then adding a <u>.json</u> suffix.

       <b>-Xf</b> <u>file</u>
           Same as <b>-X</b>, but writes all JSON contents to the specified <u>file</u>.

       <b>-fdoc</b>
           Generates "Ddoc" documentation and writes it to a file.  The compiler determines <u>file</u> by removing any
           directory components and suffix from the input file, and then adding a <u>.html</u> suffix.

       <b>-fdoc-dir=</b><u>dir</u>
           Same  as  <b>-fdoc</b>,  but  writes  documentation  to  directory  <u>dir</u>.   This  option  can  be  used  with
           <b>-fdoc-file=</b><u>file</u> to independently set the output file and directory path.

       <b>-fdoc-file=</b><u>file</u>
           Same  as  <b>-fdoc</b>,  but  writes  documentation  to <u>file</u>.  This option can be used with <b>-fdoc-dir=</b><u>dir</u> to
           independently set the output file and directory path.

       <b>-fdoc-inc=</b><u>file</u>
           Specify <u>file</u> as a <u>Ddoc</u> macro file to be read.  Multiple <b>-fdoc-inc</b> options can be used, and files  are
           read and processed in the same order.

       <b>-fdump-c++-spec=</b><u>file</u>
           For D source files, generate corresponding C++ declarations in <u>file</u>.

       <b>-fdump-c++-spec-verbose</b>
           In  conjunction  with  <b>-fdump-c++-spec=</b> above, add comments for ignored declarations in the generated
           C++ header.

       <b>-fsave-mixins=</b><u>file</u>
           Generates code expanded from D "mixin" statements and writes the processed sources to <u>file</u>.  This  is
           useful to debug errors in compilation and provides source for debuggers to show when requested.

   <b>Warnings</b>
       Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that are not inherently erroneous but that are
       risky  or  suggest  there is likely to be a bug in the program.  Unless <b>-Werror</b> is specified, they do not
       prevent compilation of the program.

       <b>-Wall</b>
           Turns on all warnings messages.  Warnings are  not  a  defined  part  of  the  D  language,  and  all
           constructs for which this may generate a warning message are valid code.

       <b>-Walloca</b>
           This option warns on all uses of "alloca" in the source.

       <b>-Walloca-larger-than=</b><u>n</u>
           Warn  on  unbounded  uses  of  alloca, and on bounded uses of alloca whose bound can be larger than <u>n</u>
           bytes.   <b>-Wno-alloca-larger-than</b>  disables  <b>-Walloca-larger-than</b>  warning  and   is   equivalent   to
           <b>-Walloca-larger-than=</b><u>SIZE_MAX</u> or larger.

       <b>-Wno-builtin-declaration-mismatch</b>
           Warn if a built-in function is declared with an incompatible signature.

       <b>-Wcast-result</b>
           Warn  about  casts  that will produce a null or zero result.  Currently this is only done for casting
           between an imaginary and non-imaginary data type, or casting between a D and C++ class.

       <b>-Wno-deprecated</b>
           Do not warn about usage of deprecated features and symbols with "deprecated" attributes.

       <b>-Werror</b>
           Turns all warnings into errors.

       <b>-Wextra</b>
           This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

           <b>-Waddress</b> <b>-Wcast-result</b> <b>-Wmismatched-special-enum</b> <b>-Wunknown-pragmas</b>

       <b>-Wmismatched-special-enum</b>
           Warn when an enum the compiler recognizes as special is declared with a different size to the  built-
           in type it is representing.

       <b>-Wspeculative</b>
           List  all  error  messages from speculative compiles, such as "__traits(compiles, ...)".  This option
           does not report messages as warnings, and these messages  therefore  never  become  errors  when  the
           <b>-Werror</b> option is also used.

       <b>-Wunknown-pragmas</b>
           Warn   when   a  pragma()  is  encountered  that  is  not  understood  by  <b>gdc</b>.   This  differs  from
           <b>-fignore-unknown-pragmas</b> where a pragma that is part of the D language, but not  implemented  by  the
           compiler, won't get reported.

       <b>-Wno-varargs</b>
           Do not warn upon questionable usage of the macros used to handle variable arguments like "va_start".

       <b>-fignore-unknown-pragmas</b>
           Turns off errors for unsupported pragmas.

       <b>-fmax-errors=</b><u>n</u>
           Limits the maximum number of error messages to <u>n</u>, at which point <b>gdc</b> bails out rather than attempting
           to  continue processing the source code.  If <u>n</u> is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number of
           error messages produced.

       <b>-fsyntax-only</b>
           Check the code for syntax errors, but do not actually compile it.  This can be  used  in  conjunction
           with  <b>-fdoc</b>  or <b>-H</b> to generate files for each module present on the command-line, but no other output
           file.

       <b>-ftransition=</b><u>id</u>
           Report additional information about D language changes identified by <u>id</u>.  The  following  values  are
           supported:

           <b>all</b> List information on all D language transitions.

           <b>complex</b>
               List all usages of complex or imaginary types.

           <b>field</b>
               List all non-mutable fields which occupy an object instance.

           <b>in</b>  List all usages of "in" on parameter.

           <b>nogc</b>
               List all hidden GC allocations.

           <b>templates</b>
               List statistics on template instantiations.

           <b>tls</b> List all variables going into thread local storage.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>Linking</b>
       These  options  come into play when the compiler links object files into an executable output file.  They
       are meaningless if the compiler is not doing a link step.

       <b>-defaultlib=</b><u>libname</u>
           Specify the library to use instead of libphobos when linking.   Options  specifying  the  linkage  of
           libphobos, such as <b>-static-libphobos</b> or <b>-shared-libphobos</b>, are ignored.

       <b>-debuglib=</b><u>libname</u>
           Specify the debug library to use instead of libphobos when linking.  This option has no effect unless
           the  <b>-g</b> option was also given on the command line.  Options specifying the linkage of libphobos, such
           as <b>-static-libphobos</b> or <b>-shared-libphobos</b>, are ignored.

       <b>-nophoboslib</b>
           Do not use the Phobos or  D  runtime  library  when  linking.   Options  specifying  the  linkage  of
           libphobos,  such  as  <b>-static-libphobos</b>  or  <b>-shared-libphobos</b>,  are  ignored.   The  standard system
           libraries are used normally, unless <b>-nostdlib</b> or <b>-nodefaultlibs</b> is used.

       <b>-shared-libphobos</b>
           On systems that provide <u>libgphobos</u> and <u>libgdruntime</u> as a shared and a  static  library,  this  option
           forces  the  use  of  the  shared  version.   If  no  shared  version was built when the compiler was
           configured, this option has no effect.

       <b>-static-libphobos</b>
           On systems that provide <u>libgphobos</u> and <u>libgdruntime</u> as a shared and a  static  library,  this  option
           forces  the  use  of  the  static  version.   If  no  static  version was built when the compiler was
           configured, this option has no effect.

   <b>Developer</b> <b>Options</b>
       This section describes command-line options that are primarily of  interest  to  developers  or  language
       tooling.

       <b>-fdump-d-original</b>
           Output  the  internal  front-end  AST  after  the  "semantic3" stage.  This option is only useful for
           debugging the GNU D compiler itself.

       <b>-v</b>  Dump information about the compiler language  processing  stages  as  the  source  program  is  being
           compiled.   This  includes  listing  all  modules that are processed through the "parse", "semantic",
           "semantic2", and "semantic3" stages; all "import" modules and their file paths;  and  all  "function"
           bodies that are being compiled.
