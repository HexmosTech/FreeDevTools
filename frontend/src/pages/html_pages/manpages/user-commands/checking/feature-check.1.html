       feature-check — query a program for supported features

       <b>feature-check</b> [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-O</b> <u>optname</u>] [<b>-P</b> <u>prefix</u>] <u>program</u> <u>feature-name</u>
       <b>feature-check</b> [<b>-O</b> <u>optname</u>] [<b>-P</b> <u>prefix</u>] <u>program</u> <u>feature-name</u> <u>op</u> <u>version</u>
       <b>feature-check</b> [<b>-O</b> <u>optname</u>] [<b>-o</b> <u>json|tsv</u>] [<b>-P</b> <u>prefix</u>] <b>-l</b> <u>program</u>
       <b>feature-check</b> <b>-V</b> | <b>-h</b>
       <b>feature-check</b> <b>--features</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>feature-check</b>  tool  obtains the list of supported features from a program via various methods (e.g.
       running it with the <b>--features</b> command-line option) and allows other programs to check for  the  presence
       and, possibly, versions of specific features.

       Options:

       <b>--features</b>
               List the compile-time features supported by this version of <b>feature-check</b>:

               feature-check
                       Always present, with the version of the <b>feature-check</b> tool.

               list    Present  if  the <b>feature-check</b> tool supports fetching the list of features supported by a
                       program.

               simple  Present if the <b>feature-check</b> tool supports comparing the  version  of  a  single  feature
                       against a specified version string.

               single  Present if the <b>feature-check</b> tool supports querying a single feature.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
               Display program usage output and exit.

       <b>-O</b> <u>optname</u>
               Specify the option to pass to the program to obtain its list of features (default <b>--features</b>).

       <b>-o</b> <u>format</u>
               Specify the output format for the full list of features with the <b>-l</b> option.

       <b>-P</b> <u>prefix</u>
               Specify  the  prefix  that <b>feature-check</b> should look for in the program's output to find the line
               that contains the list of features; default "Features: ".

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
               Display program version output and exit.

       <b>-v</b>      When querying a single feature, output the version obtained for it.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       When querying a single feature, <b>feature-check</b> will exit with code 0 if the program supports that feature,
       and with a non-zero code when either the program could not be executed, or its list of features could not
       be parsed, or the feature was not present.

       When examining the version of a single feature, <b>feature-check</b> will exit with code  0  if  the  comparison
       result  is  true,  and with a non-zero code when either the program could not be executed, or its list of
       features could not be parsed, or the comparison failed.

       When listing the features supported by a program, <b>feature-check</b> will exit with code 0 when  the  list  of
       features  was obtained and output, and with a non-zero code when either the program could not be executed
       or its list of features could not be parsed.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following examples are shown as given to the shell:

             <b>feature-check</b> <b>curl</b> <b>AsynchDNS</b>

       Exit with code 0 if the <u><a href="../man1/curl.1.html">curl</a></u>(1) tool is present and it supports asynchronous DNS lookups.

             <b>feature-check</b> <b>-l</b> <b>confget</b>

       List the features supported by the <u><a href="../man1/confget.1.html">confget</a></u>(1) tool.

             <b>feature-check</b> <b>timelimit</b> <b>'timelimit</b> <b>ge</b> <b>1.9'</b>

       Exit with code 0 if the <u><a href="../man1/timelimit.1.html">timelimit</a></u>(1) tool advertises its timelimit feature at version 1.9 or later.

             <b>feature-check</b> <b>timelimit</b> <b>timelimit</b> <b>ge</b> <b>1.9</b>

       The same check; note that the <b>feature-check</b> tool will treat all the arguments after the program name as a
       single expression, i.e. it will concatenate them into a  single  string  separated  by  spaces  and  then
       interpret the string.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
