</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       podman-system-check - Perform consistency checks on image and container storage

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>podman</b> <b>system</b> <b>check</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Perform  consistency  checks  on  image and container storage, reporting images and containers which have
       identified issues.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>--force,</b> <b>-f</b>
       When attempting to remove damaged images, also remove  containers  which  depend  on  those  images.   By
       default, damaged images which are being used by containers are left alone.

       Containers  which  depend  on  damaged  images do so regardless of which engine created them, but because
       podman only "knows" how to shut down containers that it started, the effect on  still-running  containers
       which were started by other engines is difficult to predict.

   <b>--max,</b> <b>-m=</b><u><b>duration</b></u>
       When  considering layers which are not used by any images or containers, assume that any layers which are
       more than <u>duration</u> old are the results of canceled attempts to pull images,  and  should  be  treated  as
       though they are damaged.

   <b>--quick,</b> <b>-q</b>
       Skip  checks  which  are  known  to be time-consuming.  This will prevent some types of errors from being
       detected.

   <b>--repair,</b> <b>-r</b>
       Remove any images which are determined to have been damaged in some  way,  unless  they  are  in  use  by
       containers.   Use  <b>--force</b> to remove containers which depend on damaged images, and those damaged images,
       as well.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       A reasonably quick check:

       podman system check --quick --repair --force

       A more thorough check:

       podman system check --repair --max=1h --force
