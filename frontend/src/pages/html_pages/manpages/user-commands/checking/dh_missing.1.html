</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dh_missing - check for missing files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_missing</b> [<b>-X</b><u>item</u>] [<b>--sourcedir=</b><u>dir</u>] [<u>debhelper</u> <u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_missing</b> compares the list of installed files with the files in the source directory. If any of the
       files (and symlinks) in the source directory were not installed to somewhere, it will warn on stderr
       about that (<b>--list-missing</b>) or fail (<b>--fail-missing</b>).

       Please note that in compat 11 and earlier without either of these options, <b>dh_missing</b> will silently do
       nothing.  In compat 12, <b>--list-missing</b> is the default  In compat 13 and later, <b>--fail-missing</b> is the
       default.

       This may be useful if you have a large package and want to make sure that you don't miss installing newly
       added files in new upstream releases.

       Remember to test different kinds of builds (dpkg-buildpackage -A/-B/...) as you may experience varying
       results when only a subset of the packages are built.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       debian/not-installed
           List  the files that are deliberately not installed in <u>any</u> binary package.  Paths listed in this file
           are ignored by <b>dh_missing</b>.  However, it is <b>not</b> a method to exclude files from being installed by  any
           of  the  debhelper  tool.   If  you want a tool to not install a given file, please use its <b>--exclude</b>
           option (where available).

           <b>dh_missing</b> will expand wildcards in this file (since debhelper 11.1).  Wildcards without matches will
           be ignored.

           Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as documented in <b><a href="../man7/debhelper.7.html">debhelper</a></b>(7).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--list-missing</b>
           Warn on stderr about source files not installed to somewhere.

           Note that many dh-tools acting on a path will mark the path as installed even if it has been excluded
           via <b>-X</b> or <b>--exclude</b>.  This is also seen when a dh-tool is acting on a directory and exclusion is used
           to ignore some files in the directory.  In either case, this will make <b>dh_missing</b> silently assume the
           excluded files have been handled.

           This is the default in compat 12.

       <b>--fail-missing</b>
           This option is like <b>--list-missing</b>, except if a file was missed, it will not only  list  the  missing
           files, but also fail with a nonzero exit code.

           This is the default in compat 13 and later.
