</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cksum — write file checksums and sizes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       cksum <b>[</b><u>file</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>cksum</u>  utility shall calculate and write to standard output a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for each
       input file, and also write to standard output the number of octets in each file. The CRC used is based on
       the polynomial used for CRC error checking in the ISO/IEC 8802‐3:1996 standard (Ethernet).

       The encoding for the CRC checksum is defined by the generating polynomial:

           <u>G</u>(<u>x</u>)=<u>x</u>32+<u>x</u>26+<u>x</u>23+<u>x</u>22+<u>x</u>16+<u>x</u>12+<u>x</u>11+<u>x</u>10+<u>x</u>8+<u>x</u>7+<u>x</u>5+<u>x</u>4+<u>x</u>2+<u>x</u>+1

       Mathematically, the CRC value corresponding to a given file shall be defined by the following procedure:

        1. The <u>n</u> bits to be evaluated are considered to be the coefficients of a mod 2 polynomial <u>M</u>(<u>x</u>) of degree
           <u>n</u>-1.  These <u>n</u> bits are the bits from  the  file,  with  the  most  significant  bit  being  the  most
           significant  bit  of  the first octet of the file and the last bit being the least significant bit of
           the last octet, padded with zero bits (if  necessary)  to  achieve  an  integral  number  of  octets,
           followed  by  one  or  more  octets  representing  the  length  of  the file as a binary value, least
           significant octet first. The smallest number of octets capable of representing this integer shall  be
           used.

        2. <u>M</u>(<u>x</u>)  is  multiplied by <u>x</u>32 (that is, shifted left 32 bits) and divided by <u>G</u>(<u>x</u>) using mod 2 division,
           producing a remainder <u>R</u>(<u>x</u>) of degree ≤ 31.

        3. The coefficients of <u>R</u>(<u>x</u>) are considered to be a 32-bit sequence.

        4. The bit sequence is complemented and the result is the CRC.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>file</u>      A pathname of a file to be checked. If no <u>file</u> operands are specified, the standard input shall
                 be used.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The standard input shall be used if no <u>file</u> operands are specified, and shall be used if a  <u>file</u>  operand
       is  <b>'-'</b>  and  the implementation treats the <b>'-'</b> as meaning standard input.  Otherwise, the standard input
       shall not be used.  See the INPUT FILES section.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The input files can be any file type.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>cksum</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       For each file processed successfully, the <u>cksum</u> utility shall write in the following format:

           "%u %d %s\n", &lt;<u>checksum</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>#</u> <u>of</u> <u>octets</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>pathname</u>&gt;

       If no <u>file</u> operand was specified, the pathname and its leading &lt;space&gt; shall be omitted.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All files were processed successfully.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>cksum</u>  utility  is typically used to quickly compare a suspect file against a trusted version of the
       same, such as to ensure that files transmitted over noisy media arrive intact. However,  this  comparison
       cannot  be  considered  cryptographically secure. The chances of a damaged file producing the same CRC as
       the original are small; deliberate deception is difficult, but probably not impossible.

       Although input files to <u>cksum</u> can be any type, the  results  need  not  be  what  would  be  expected  on
       character  special  device  files  or  on  file  types  not  described by the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017. Since this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify the block size used  when  doing  input,
       checksums of character special files need not process all of the data in those files.

       The algorithm is expressed in terms of a bitstream divided into octets.  If a file is transmitted between
       two  systems  and undergoes any data transformation (such as changing little-endian byte ordering to big-
       endian), identical CRC values cannot be expected. Implementations  performing  such  transformations  may
       extend <u>cksum</u> to handle such situations.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The following C-language program can be used as a model to describe the algorithm. It assumes that a <b>char</b>
       is  one  octet. It also assumes that the entire file is available for one pass through the function. This
       was done for simplicity in demonstrating the algorithm, rather than as an implementation model.

               }

               return ~s;
           }

       The historical practice of writing the number of ``blocks'' has been changed to  writing  the  number  of
       octets, since the latter is not only more useful, but also since historical implementations have not been
       consistent in defining what a ``block'' meant.

       The  algorithm  used  was selected to increase the operational robustness of <u>cksum</u>.  Neither the System V
       nor BSD <u>sum</u> algorithm was selected. Since each of these was different and each was the  default  behavior
       on  those  systems,  no realistic compromise was available if either were selected—some set of historical
       applications would break. Therefore, the name was changed to <u>cksum</u>.  Although the historical <u>sum</u> commands
       will probably continue to be provided for many years, programs designed for  portability  across  systems
       should use the new name.

       The algorithm selected is based on that used by the ISO/IEC 8802‐3:1996 standard (Ethernet) for the frame
       check  sequence field. The algorithm used does not match the technical definition of a <u>checksum</u>; the term
       is used for historical reasons. The length of the file is included in the CRC  calculation  because  this
       parallels  inclusion  of  a  length  field  by  Ethernet  in  its CRC, but also because it guards against
       inadvertent collisions between files that begin with different series of zero octets. The chance that two
       different files produce identical CRCs is much greater when their lengths are not considered. Keeping the
       length and the checksum of the file itself separate would yield a slightly  more  robust  algorithm,  but
       historical  usage has always been that a single number (the checksum as printed) represents the signature
       of the file. It was decided that historical usage was the more important consideration.

       Early proposals contained modifications to the Ethernet algorithm that involved extracting  table  values
       whenever  an  intermediate  result  became zero. This was demonstrated to be less robust than the current
       method and mathematically difficult to describe or justify.

       The calculation used is identical to that given in pseudo-code in the  referenced  Sarwate  article.  The
       pseudo-code rendition is:

           X &lt;- 0; Y &lt;- 0;
           for i &lt;- m -1 step -1 until 0 do
               begin
               T &lt;- <a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1) ^ A[i];
               <a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1) &lt;- <a href="../man0/X.0.html">X</a>(0); <a href="../man0/X.0.html">X</a>(0) &lt;- <a href="../man1/Y.1.html">Y</a>(1); <a href="../man1/Y.1.html">Y</a>(1) &lt;- <a href="../man0/Y.0.html">Y</a>(0); <a href="../man0/Y.0.html">Y</a>(0) &lt;- 0;
               comment: f[T] and f'[T] denote the T-th words in the
                   table f and f' ;
               X &lt;- X ^ f[T]; Y &lt;- Y ^ f'[T];
               end

       The  pseudo-code is reproduced exactly as given; however, note that in the case of <u>cksum</u>, <b>A[i]</b> represents
       a byte of the file, the words <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> are treated as a single 32-bit value, and the tables <b>f</b> and <b>f'</b> are a
       single table containing 32-bit values.

       The referenced Sarwate article also discusses generating the table.
