       screen - screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>screen</b> [ <b>-</b><u>options</u> ] [ <u>cmd</u> [ <u>args</u> ] ]
       <b>screen</b> <b>-r</b> [[<u>pid</u><b>.</b>]<u>tty</u>[<b>.</b><u>host</u>]]
       <b>screen</b> <b>-r</b> <u>sessionowner</u><b>/</b>[[<u>pid</u><b>.</b>]<u>tty</u>[<b>.</b><u>host</u>]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Screen</u>  is  a  full-screen  window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes
       (typically interactive shells).  Each virtual terminal provides the functions of  a  DEC  VT100  terminal
       and,  in  addition,  several  control  functions  from  the  ISO  6429 (ECMA 48, ANSI X3.64) and ISO 2022
       standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support for multiple  character  sets).   There  is  a  scrollback
       history  buffer  for each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving text regions
       between windows.

       When <u>screen</u> is called, it creates a single window with a shell in it (or the specified command) and  then
       gets  out  of your way so that you can use the program as you normally would.  Then, at any time, you can
       create new (full-screen) windows with other programs in  them  (including  more  shells),  kill  existing
       windows,  view  a  list  of windows, turn output logging on and off, copy-and-paste text between windows,
       view the scrollback history, switch between windows in whatever manner you wish,  etc.  All  windows  run
       their  programs  completely  independent  of  each  other.  Programs continue to run when their window is
       currently not visible and even when the whole <u>screen</u> session is detached from the user's terminal.   When
       a program terminates, <u>screen</u> (per default) kills the window that contained it.  If this window was in the
       foreground,  the  display switches to the previous window; if none are left, <u>screen</u> exits. Shells usually
       distinguish between running as login-shell or sub-shell.  Screen runs them  as  sub-shells,  unless  told
       otherwise (See shell .screenrc command).

       Everything  you type is sent to the program running in the current window.  The only exception to this is
       the one keystroke that is used to initiate a command to the window manager.   By  default,  each  command
       begins  with  a  control-a  (abbreviated  C-a  from now on), and is followed by one other keystroke.  The
       command character and all the key bindings can be fully customized to be anything you like,  though  they
       are always two characters in length.

       <u>Screen</u>  does  not understand the prefix C- to mean control, although this notation is used in this manual
       for readability.  Please use the caret notation (^A instead of C-a)  as  arguments  to  e.g.  the  <u>escape</u>
       command or the <u>-e</u> option.  <u>Screen</u> will also print out control characters in caret notation.

       The  standard way to create a new window is to type <b>C-a</b> <b>c</b>.  This creates a new window running a shell and
       switches to that window immediately, regardless of the state  of  the  process  running  in  the  current
       window.   Similarly, you can create a new window with a custom command in it by first binding the command
       to a keystroke (in your .screenrc file or at the <b>C-a</b> <b>:</b> command line) and then using it just like the  <b>C-a</b>
       <b>c</b> command.  In addition, new windows can be created by running a command like:

              screen emacs prog.c

       from  a  shell  prompt within a previously created window.  This will not run another copy of <u>screen</u>, but
       will instead supply the command name and its arguments to the  window  manager  (specified  in  the  $STY
       environment  variable) who will use it to create the new window.  The above example would start the emacs
       editor (editing prog.c) and switch to its window. - Note that you cannot transport environment  variables
       from  the  invoking  shell  to the application (emacs in this case), because it is forked from the parent
       screen process, not from the invoking shell.

       If <a href="file:/run/utmp">/run/utmp</a> is writable by <u>screen</u>, an appropriate record will be written to this file for  each  window,
       and  removed  when  the  window  is  terminated.  This is useful for working with talk, script, shutdown,
       rsend, sccs and other similar programs that use the utmp file to determine who you are. As long as <u>screen</u>
       is active on your terminal, the terminal's own record is removed from the utmp file. See also C-a L.

</pre><h4><b>GETTING</b> <b>STARTED</b></h4><pre>
       Before you begin to use <u>screen</u> you'll need to make sure you have correctly selected your  terminal  type,
       just as you would for any other termcap/terminfo program.  (You can do this by using <u>test</u> for example.)

       If  you're  impatient  and want to get started without doing a lot more reading, you should remember this
       one command:  <b>C-a</b> <b>?</b>.  Typing these two characters will display a list of the  available  <u>screen</u>  commands
       and  their  bindings. Each keystroke is discussed in the section DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS. The manual section
       CUSTOMIZATION deals with the contents of your .screenrc.

       If your terminal is a true auto-margin terminal (it doesn't allow the last position on the screen  to  be
       updated  without  scrolling  the  screen)  consider  using  a version of your terminal's termcap that has
       automatic margins turned <u>off</u>. This will ensure an accurate and  optimal  update  of  the  screen  in  all
       circumstances.  Most  terminals  nowadays have magic margins (automatic margins plus usable last column).
       This is the VT100 style type and perfectly suited for <u>screen</u>.  If all you've got is  a  true  auto-margin
       terminal  <u>screen</u>  will  be  content to use it, but updating a character put into the last position on the
       screen may not be possible until the screen scrolls or the character is moved into  a  safe  position  in
       some other way. This delay can be shortened by using a terminal with insert-character capability.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Screen has the following command-line options:

       <b>-a</b>   include  <u>all</u> capabilities (with some minor exceptions) in each window's termcap, even if <u>screen</u> must
            redraw parts of the display in order to implement a function.

       <b>-A</b>   Adapt the sizes of all windows to the size of the current terminal.  By  default,  <u>screen</u>  tries  to
            restore  its  old  window  sizes  when  attaching  to  resizable  terminals  (those  with  WS in its
            description, e.g. suncmd or some xterm).

       <b>-c</b> <u>file</u>
            override the default configuration file from $HOME/.screenrc to <u>file</u>.

       <b>-d</b>|<b>-D</b> [<u>pid.tty.host</u>]
            does not start <u>screen</u>, but detaches the elsewhere running <u>screen</u> session. It has the same effect  as
            typing  C-a  d from <u>screen</u>'s controlling terminal. <b>-D</b> is the equivalent to the power detach key.  If
            no session can be detached, this option is ignored.  In  combination  with  the  <b>-r</b>/<b>-R</b>  option  more
            powerful effects can be achieved:

       <b>-d</b> <b>-r</b>   Reattach a session and if necessary detach it first.

       <b>-d</b> <b>-R</b>   Reattach a session and if necessary detach or even create it first.

       <b>-d</b> <b>-RR</b>  Reattach  a  session and if necessary detach or create it. Use the first session if more than one
               session is available.

       <b>-D</b> <b>-r</b>   Reattach a session. If necessary detach and logout remotely first.

       <b>-D</b> <b>-R</b>   Attach here and now. In detail this means: If a session is running, then reattach.  If  necessary
               detach  and  logout remotely first.  If it was not running create it and notify the user. This is
               the author's favorite.

       <b>-D</b> <b>-RR</b>  Attach here and now. Whatever that means, just do it.

            Note: It is always a good idea to check the status of your sessions by means of screen -list.

       <b>-e</b> <u>xy</u>
            specifies the command character to be <u>x</u> and the character generating a literal command character  to
            <u>y</u>  (when  typed after the command character).  The default is C-a and `a', which can be specified as
            -e^Aa.  When creating a <u>screen</u> session, this  option  sets  the  default  command  character.  In  a
            multiuser  session all users added will start off with this command character. But when attaching to
            an already running session, this option changes only the command character of  the  attaching  user.
            This option is equivalent to either the commands defescape or escape respectively.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>-fn</b>, and <b>-fa</b>
            turns  flow-control  on,  off,  or  automatic  switching mode.  This can also be defined through the
            defflow .screenrc command.

       <b>-h</b> <u>num</u>
            Specifies the history scrollback buffer to be <u>num</u> lines high.

       <b>-i</b>   will cause the interrupt key (usually C-c) to interrupt the display immediately when flow-control is
            on.  See the defflow .screenrc command for details.  The use of this option is discouraged.

       <b>-l</b> and <b>-ln</b>
            turns login mode on or off (for <a href="file:/run/utmp">/run/utmp</a> updating).  This can also be defined through the  deflogin
            .screenrc command.

       <b>-ls</b> [<u>match</u>]
       <b>-list</b> [<u>match</u>]
            does not start <u>screen</u>, but prints a list of <u>pid.tty.host</u> strings and creation timestamps identifying
            your  <u>screen</u>  sessions.   Sessions  marked  `detached'  can  be resumed with screen -r. Those marked
            `attached' are running and have a controlling terminal. If the session runs in multiuser mode, it is
            marked `multi'. Sessions marked as `unreachable' either live on a different host or are `dead'.   An
            unreachable  session is considered dead, when its name matches either the name of the local host, or
            the specified parameter, if any.  See the <b>-r</b> flag  for  a  description  how  to  construct  matches.
            Sessions  marked  as `dead' should be thoroughly checked and removed.  Ask your system administrator
            if you are not sure. Remove sessions with the <b>-wipe</b> option.

       <b>-L</b>   tells <u>screen</u> to turn on automatic output logging for the windows.

       <b>-Logfile</b> <u>file</u>
            By default logfile name is screenlog.0. You can set new logfile name with the -Logfile option.

       <b>-m</b>   causes <u>screen</u> to ignore the $STY environment variable. With screen -m creation of a new  session  is
            enforced,  regardless  whether <u>screen</u> is called from within another <u>screen</u> session or not. This flag
            has a special meaning in connection with the `-d' option:

       <b>-d</b> <b>-m</b>   Start <u>screen</u> in detached mode. This creates a new session but  doesn't  attach  to  it.  This  is
               useful for system startup scripts.

       <b>-D</b> <b>-m</b>   This  also  starts  screen in detached mode, but doesn't fork a new process. The command exits if
               the session terminates.

       <b>-O</b>   selects an optimal output mode for your terminal rather than  true  VT100  emulation  (only  affects
            auto-margin terminals without `LP').  This can also be set in your .screenrc by specifying `OP' in a
            termcap command.

       <b>-p</b> <u>number_or_name|-|=|+</u>
            Preselect  a  window.  This  is useful when you want to reattach to a specific window or you want to
            send a command via the -X option to a specific window. As with screen's select  command,  -  selects
            the  blank  window.  As a special case for reattach, = brings up the windowlist on the blank window,
            while a + will create a new window. The command will not be executed if the specified  window  could
            not be found.

       <b>-q</b>   Suppress  printing  of  error  messages.  In  combination  with  -ls the exit value is as follows: 9
            indicates a directory without sessions. 10 indicates a directory with  running  but  not  attachable
            sessions. 11 (or more) indicates 1 (or more) usable sessions.  In combination with -r the exit value
            is  as  follows:  10 indicates that there is no session to resume. 12 (or more) indicates that there
            are 2 (or more) sessions to resume and you should specify which one to choose.  In all  other  cases
            -q has no effect.

       <b>-Q</b>   Some  commands now can be queried from a remote session using this flag, e.g. screen -Q windows. The
            commands will send the response to the stdout of the querying process. If there was an error in  the
            command, then the querying process will exit with a non-zero status.

            The commands that can be queried now are:
             <b>echo</b>
             <b>info</b>
             <b>lastmsg</b>
             <b>number</b>
             <b>select</b>
             <b>time</b>
             <b>title</b>
             <b>windows</b>

       <b>-r</b> [<u>pid.tty.host</u>]
       <b>-r</b> <u>sessionowner/[pid.tty.host</u>]
            resumes  a  detached  <u>screen</u>  session.   No  other  options  (except combinations with <b>-d</b>/<b>-D</b>) may be
            specified, though an optional prefix of [<u>pid.</u>]<u>tty.host</u> may be needed to distinguish between multiple
            detached <u>screen</u> sessions.  The second form is used to connect to another user's screen session which
            runs in multiuser mode. This indicates that screen  should  look  for  sessions  in  another  user's
            directory. This requires setuid-root.

       <b>-R</b>   resumes  screen  only  when  it's  unambiguous  which one to attach, usually when only one <u>screen</u> is
            detached. Otherwise lists available sessions.  <b>-RR</b> attempts to resume  the  youngest  (in  terms  of
            creation  time) detached <u>screen</u> session it finds.  If successful, all other command-line options are
            ignored.  If no detached session exists, starts a new session using the specified options,  just  as
            if  <b>-R</b>  had  not  been  specified.  The  option  is set by default if <u>screen</u> is run as a login-shell
            (actually screen uses -xRR in that case).  For combinations with the <b>-d</b>/<b>-D</b> option see there.   <b>Note:</b>
            Time-based session selection is a Debian addition.

       <b>-s</b> <u>program</u>
            sets  the  default  shell to the program specified, instead of the value in the environment variable
            $SHELL (or <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> if not defined).  This can also be defined through the shell  .screenrc  command.
            See also there.

       <b>-S</b> <u>sessionname</u>
            When  creating  a new session, this option can be used to specify a meaningful name for the session.
            This name identifies the session for screen -list and screen -r actions. It substitutes the  default
            [<u>tty.host</u>] suffix. This name should not be longer then 80 symbols.

       <b>-t</b> <u>name</u>
            sets  the  title  (a.k.a.)  for  the  default  shell  or specified program.  See also the shelltitle
            .screenrc command.

       <b>-T</b> <u>term</u>
            Set the $TERM environment variable using the specified term as opposed to  the  default  setting  of
            <b>screen</b>.

       <b>-U</b>   Run  screen  in  UTF-8 mode. This option tells screen that your terminal sends and understands UTF-8
            encoded characters. It also sets the default encoding for new windows to `utf8'.

       <b>-v</b>   Print version number.

       <b>-wipe</b> [<u>match</u>]
            does the same as screen -ls, but removes destroyed sessions instead of marking them as  `dead'.   An
            unreachable  session is considered dead, when its name matches either the name of the local host, or
            the explicitly given parameter, if any.  See the <b>-r</b> flag for a description how to construct matches.

       <b>-x</b>   Attach to a not detached <u>screen</u> session. (Multi display mode).  <u>Screen</u> refuses to attach from within
            itself.  But when cascading multiple screens, loops are not detected; take care.

       <b>-X</b>   Send the specified command to a running screen session. You may use the <b>-S</b>  option  to  specify  the
            screen  session if you have several screen sessions running. You can use the <b>-d</b> or <b>-r</b> option to tell
            screen to look only for attached or detached screen sessions. Note that this command doesn't work if
            the session is password protected.

       <b>-4</b>   Resolve hostnames only to IPv4 addresses.

       <b>-6</b>   Resolve hostnames only to IPv6 addresses.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       As mentioned, each <u>screen</u> command  consists  of  a  C-a  followed  by  one  other  character.   For  your
       convenience,  all commands that are bound to lower-case letters are also bound to their control character
       counterparts (with the exception of C-a a; see below), thus, C-a c as well as C-a  C-c  can  be  used  to
       create a window. See section CUSTOMIZATION for a description of the command.

       The  following table shows the default key bindings. The trailing commas in boxes with multiple keystroke
       entries are separators, not part of the bindings.
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>C-a</b> <b>'</b>              (select)          Prompt for a window name  or

                                            that this  binding  defaults
                                            to   the  command  character
                                            typed     twice,      unless
                                            overridden.   For  instance,
                                            if you use the option  <b>-e]x</b>,
                                            this command becomes ]].

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOMIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       The socket directory defaults either  to  $HOME/.screen  or  simply  to  /tmp/screens  or  preferably  to
       <a href="file:/run/screen">/run/screen</a>  chosen  at  compile-time.  If <u>screen</u> is installed setuid-root, then the administrator should
       compile <u>screen</u> with an adequate (not NFS mounted) socket directory. If <u>screen</u> is not running setuid-root,
       the user can specify any mode 700 directory in the environment variable $SCREENDIR.

       When <u>screen</u> is invoked, it executes initialization commands from the  files  <a href="file:/etc/screenrc">/etc/screenrc</a>  and  defaults
       that  can  be  overridden  in  the  following  ways: for the global screenrc file <u>screen</u> searches for the
       environment variable $SYSSCREENRC (this override feature may  be  disabled  at  compile-time).  The  user
       specific  screenrc file is searched in $SCREENRC, then $HOME/.screenrc.  The command line option <b>-c</b> takes
       precedence over the above user screenrc files.

       Commands in these files are used to set options, bind functions to keys, and to  automatically  establish
       one  or  more  windows  at  the beginning of your <u>screen</u> session.  Commands are listed one per line, with
       empty lines being ignored.  A command's arguments are separated by tabs or spaces, and may be  surrounded
       by  single  or  double  quotes.   A  `#'  turns  the  rest  of the line into a comment, except in quotes.
       Unintelligible lines are warned about and  ignored.   Commands  may  contain  references  to  environment
       variables.  The  syntax is the shell-like "$VAR " or "${VAR}". Note that this causes incompatibility with
       previous <u>screen</u> versions, as now  the  '$'-character  has  to  be  protected  with  '\'  if  no  variable
       substitution shall be performed. A string in single-quotes is also protected from variable substitution.

       Two  configuration  files  are  shipped  as  examples  with  your  screen  distribution: etc/screenrc and
       etc/etcscreenrc. They contain a number of useful examples for various commands.

       Customization can also be done 'on-line'. To enter the command mode type  `C-a  :'.  Note  that  commands
       starting with def change default values, while others change current settings.

       The following commands are available:

       <b>acladd</b> <u>usernames</u> [<u>crypted-pw</u>]

       <b>addacl</b> <u>usernames</u>

       Enable  users to fully access this screen session. <u>Usernames</u> can be one user or a comma separated list of
       users. This command enables to attach to the <u>screen</u>  session  and  performs  the  equivalent  of  `aclchg
       <u>usernames</u>  +rwx  "#?"'.   executed. To add a user with restricted access, use the `aclchg' command below.
       If an optional second parameter is supplied, it should be a  crypted  password  for  the  named  user(s).
       `Addacl' is a synonym to `acladd'.  Multi user mode only.

       <b>aclchg</b> <u>usernames</u> <u>permbits</u> <u>list</u>

       <b>chacl</b> <u>usernames</u> <u>permbits</u> <u>list</u>

       Change  permissions  for a comma separated list of users. Permission bits are represented as `r', `w' and
       `x'. Prefixing `+' grants the permission, `-' removes it. The third parameter is a comma  separated  list
       of  commands  and/or  windows  (specified  either by number or title). The special list `#' refers to all
       windows, `?' to all commands. if <u>usernames</u> consists of a single `*', all known users are affected.

       A command can be executed when the user has the `x' bit for it.  The user can type input to a window when
       he has its `w' bit set and no other user obtains a writelock for this window.  Other bits  are  currently
       ignored.   To  withdraw  the writelock from another user in window 2: `aclchg <u>username</u> -w+w 2'.  To allow
       read-only access to the session: `aclchg <u>username</u> -w "#"'. As soon as a user's name is known to <u>screen</u> he
       can attach to the session and (per default) has full permissions for all command and  windows.  Execution
       permission for the acl commands, `at' and others should also be removed or the user may be able to regain
       write permission.  Rights of the special username <b>nobody</b> cannot be changed (see the su command).  `Chacl'
       is a synonym to `aclchg'.  Multi user mode only.

       <b>acldel</b> <u>username</u>

       Remove  a  user  from  <u>screen</u>'s  access  control list. If currently attached, all the user's displays are
       detached from the session. He cannot attach again.  Multi user mode only.

       <b>aclgrp</b> <u>username</u> [<u>groupname</u>]

       Creates groups of users that share common access rights. The name of the group is  the  username  of  the
       group  leader.  Each  member  of the group inherits the permissions that are granted to the group leader.
       That means, if a user fails an access check, another check is made for  the  group  leader.   A  user  is
       removed from all groups the special value none is used for <u>groupname</u>.  If the second parameter is omitted
       all groups the user is in are listed.

       <b>aclumask</b> [[ <u>users</u> ] <u>+bits</u> | [ <u>users</u> ] <u>-bits...</u> ]

       <b>umask</b> [[ <u>users</u> ] <u>+bits</u> | [ <u>users</u> ] <u>-bits...</u> ]

       This  specifies the access other users have to windows that will be created by the caller of the command.
       <u>Users</u> may be no, one or a comma separated list of known usernames. If no users are specified, a  list  of
       all  currently  known  users  is assumed.  <u>Bits</u> is any combination of access control bits allowed defined
       with the aclchg command. The special username ? predefines the access that not yet known  users  will  be
       granted  to any window initially.  The special username ?? predefines the access that not yet known users
       are granted to any command.  Rights of the  special  username  <b>nobody</b>  cannot  be  changed  (see  the  su
       command).  `Umask' is a synonym to `aclumask'.

       <b>activity</b> <u>message</u>

       When  any  activity occurs in a background window that is being monitored, <u>screen</u> displays a notification
       in the message line.  The notification message can be re-defined by means of the activity command.   Each
       occurrence  of `%' in <u>message</u> is replaced by the number of the window in which activity has occurred, and
       each occurrence of `^G' is replaced by the definition for bell in your termcap (usually an audible bell).
       The default message is

                   'Activity in window %n'

       Note that monitoring is off for all windows by default, but can be altered by use of the monitor  command
       (C-a M).

       <b>allpartial</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       If  set  to on, only the current cursor line is refreshed on window change.  This affects all windows and
       is useful for slow terminal lines. The previous setting  of  full/partial  refresh  for  each  window  is
       restored  with  allpartial  off.   This  is  a  global  flag that immediately takes effect on all windows
       overriding the partial settings. It does not change the default redraw behavior of newly created windows.

       <b>altscreen</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       If set to on, "alternate screen" support is enabled in virtual terminals, just like  in  xterm.   Initial
       setting is `off'.

       <b>at</b> [<u>identifier</u>][<b>#</b>|<b>*</b>|<b>%</b>] command <b>[</b><u>args</u> <b>...</b> <b>]</b>

       Execute  a  command at other displays or windows as if it had been entered there.  At changes the context
       (the `current window' or `current display' setting) of the command. If the first  parameter  describes  a
       non-unique  context,  the  command will be executed multiple times. If the first parameter is of the form
       `<u>identifier</u>*' then identifier is matched against user names.  The  command  is  executed  once  for  each
       display  of  the  selected  user(s).  If  the  first parameter is of the form `<u>identifier</u>%' identifier is
       matched against displays. Displays are named after the ttys they attach. The prefix `<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>' or `/dev/tty'
       may be omitted from the identifier.  If <u>identifier</u> has a `#' or nothing appended it  is  matched  against
       window  numbers  and titles. Omitting an identifier in front of the `#', `*' or `%'-character selects all
       users, displays or windows because a prefix-match is performed. Note that on the  affected  display(s)  a
       short message will describe what happened. Permission is checked for initiator of the at command, not for
       the owners of the affected display(s).  Note that the '#' character works as a comment introducer when it
       is  preceded  by  whitespace.  This  can  be  escaped  by prefixing a '\'.  Permission is checked for the
       initiator of the at command, not for the owners of the affected display(s).

       Caveat: When matching against windows, the command is executed at least once per  window.  Commands  that
       change  the  internal  arrangement  of  windows  (like  other) may be called again. In shared windows the
       command will be repeated for each attached display. Beware, when  issuing  toggle  commands  like  login!
       Some  commands  (e.g.  process)  require  that  a  display  is associated with the target windows.  These
       commands may not work correctly under at looping over windows.

       <b>attrcolor</b> <u>attrib</u> [<u>attribute/color-modifier</u>]

       This command can be used to highlight attributes by changing the color of  the  text.  If  the  attribute
       <u>attrib</u>  is  in  use, the specified attribute/color modifier is also applied. If no modifier is given, the
       current one is deleted. See the STRING ESCAPES chapter for the syntax of the modifier. Screen understands
       two pseudo-attributes, i stands for high-intensity foreground color and I for  high-intensity  background
       color.

       Examples:

              attrcolor b "R"

       Change the color to bright red if bold text is to be printed.

              attrcolor u "-u b"

       Use blue text instead of underline.

              attrcolor b ".I"

       Use bright colors for bold text. Most terminal emulators do this already.

              attrcolor i "+b"

       Make bright colored text also bold.

       <b>autodetach</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Sets  whether  <u>screen</u>  will automatically detach upon hangup, which saves all your running programs until
       they are resumed with a <b>screen</b> <b>-r</b> command.  When turned off, a hangup signal will  terminate  <u>screen</u>  and
       all the processes it contains. Autodetach is on by default.

       <b>autonuke</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Sets  whether  a  clear  screen  sequence  should  nuke  all  the output that has not been written to the
       terminal. See also obuflimit.

       <b>backtick</b> <u>id</u> <u>lifespan</u> <u>autorefresh</u> <u>cmd</u> <u>args...</u>

       <b>backtick</b> <u>id</u>

       Program the backtick command with the numerical id <u>id</u>.   The  output  of  such  a  command  is  used  for
       substitution  of  the  %`  string  escape.  The specified <u>lifespan</u> is the number of seconds the output is
       considered valid. After this time, the  command  is  run  again  if  a  corresponding  string  escape  is
       encountered.   The <u>autorefresh</u> parameter triggers an automatic refresh for caption and hardstatus strings
       after the specified number of seconds. Only the last line of output is used for substitution.

       If both the <u>lifespan</u> and the <u>autorefresh</u> parameters are zero, the backtick program is expected to stay in
       the background and generate output once in a while.  In this case, the command is executed right away and
       screen stores the last line of output. If a new line gets printed screen will automatically  refresh  the
       hardstatus or the captions.

       The second form of the command deletes the backtick command with the numerical id <u>id</u>.

       <b>bce</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Change   background-color-erase   setting.   If   bce  is  set  to  on,  all  characters  cleared  by  an
       erase/insert/scroll/clear operation will be displayed in the  current  background  color.  Otherwise  the
       default background color is used.

       <b>bell_msg</b> [<u>message</u>]

       When a bell character is sent to a background window, <u>screen</u> displays a notification in the message line.
       The  notification  message  can  be  re-defined  by  this  command.  Each occurrence of `%' in <u>message</u> is
       replaced by the number of the window to which a bell has been  sent,  and  each  occurrence  of  `^G'  is
       replaced by the definition for bell in your termcap (usually an audible bell).  The default message is

                   'Bell in window %n'

       An  empty  message can be supplied to the bell_msg command to suppress output of a message line (bell_msg
       "").  Without parameter, the current message is shown.

       <b>bind</b> [<u>class</u>] <u>key</u> [<u>command</u> [<u>args</u>]]

       Bind a command to a key.  By default, most of the commands provided by <u>screen</u> are bound to  one  or  more
       keys  as  indicated in the DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS section, e.g. the command to create a new window is bound
       to C-c and c.  The bind command can be used to redefine the key bindings and to define new bindings.  The
       <u>key</u> argument is either a single character, a two-character sequence of  the  form  ^x  (meaning  C-x),  a
       backslash  followed  by  an  octal  number  (specifying  the ASCII code of the character), or a backslash
       followed by a second character, such as \^ or \\.  The argument can also be quoted, if you like.   If  no
       further  argument  is  given,  any  previously  established binding for this key is removed.  The <u>command</u>
       argument can be any command listed in this section.

       If a command class is specified via the -c option, the key is bound for  the  specified  class.  Use  the
       command  command  to  activate  a  class.  Command classes can be used to create multiple command keys or
       multi-character bindings.

       Some examples:

                   bind ' ' windows
                   bind ^k
                   bind k
                   bind K kill
                   bind ^f screen telnet foobar
                   bind \033 screen -ln -t root -h 1000 9 su

       would bind the space key to the command that displays a list of windows  (so  that  the  command  usually
       invoked  by  C-a  C-w would also be available as C-a space). The next three lines remove the default kill
       binding from C-a C-k and C-a k.  C-a K is then bound to the kill  command.  Then  it  binds  C-f  to  the
       command  create  a window with a TELNET connection to foobar, and bind escape to the command that creates
       an non-login window with a.k.a. root in slot #9, with a superuser shell and a scrollback buffer  of  1000
       lines.

                   bind -c demo1 0 select 10
                   bind -c demo1 1 select 11
                   bind -c demo1 2 select 12
                   bindkey "^B" command -c demo1

       makes C-b 0 select window 10, C-b 1 window 11, etc.

                   bind -c demo2 0 select 10
                   bind -c demo2 1 select 11
                   bind -c demo2 2 select 12
                   bind - command -c demo2

       makes C-a - 0 select window 10, C-a - 1 window 11, etc.

       <b>bindkey</b> [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-m</b>] [<b>-a</b>] [[<b>-k</b>|<b>-t</b>] <u>string</u> [<u>cmd-args</u>]]

       This command manages screen's input translation tables. Every entry in one of the tables tells screen how
       to  react  if  a  certain  sequence of characters is encountered. There are three tables: one that should
       contain actions programmed by the user, one for the default actions used for terminal emulation  and  one
       for  screen's  copy  mode  to do cursor movement. See section INPUT TRANSLATION for a list of default key
       bindings.

       If the <b>-d</b> option is given, bindkey modifies the default table, <b>-m</b> changes the copy mode  table  and  with
       neither option the user table is selected.  The argument <u>string</u> is the sequence of characters to which an
       action is bound. This can either be a fixed string or a termcap keyboard capability name (selectable with
       the <b>-k</b> option).

       Some  keys  on  a  VT100  terminal  can send a different string if application mode is turned on (e.g the
       cursor keys).  Such keys have two entries in the translation table. You can select the  application  mode
       entry by specifying the <b>-a</b> option.

       The  <b>-t</b> option tells screen not to do inter-character timing. One cannot turn off the timing if a termcap
       capability is used.

       <u>Cmd</u> can be any of screen's commands with an arbitrary number of <u>args</u>.  If <u>cmd</u> is omitted the  key-binding
       is removed from the table.

       Here are some examples of keyboard bindings:

               bindkey -d

       Show all of the default key bindings. The application mode entries are marked with [A].

               bindkey -k k1 select 1

       Make the "F1" key switch to window one.

               bindkey -t foo stuff barfoo

       Make "foo" an abbreviation of the word "barfoo". Timeout is disabled so that users can type slowly.

               bindkey "\024" mapdefault

       This  key-binding  makes  ^T  an  escape  character  for  key-bindings. If you did the above stuff barfoo
       binding, you can enter the word foo by typing ^Tfoo. If you want to insert a ^T you have to press the key
       twice (i.e., escape the escape binding).

               bindkey -k F1 command

       Make the F11 (not F1!) key an alternative screen escape (besides ^A).

       <b>break</b> [<u>duration</u>]

       Send a break signal for <u>duration</u>*0.25 seconds to this window.  For non-Posix systems  the  time  interval
       may  be  rounded  up to full seconds.  Most useful if a character device is attached to the window rather
       than a shell process (See also chapter WINDOW TYPES). The maximum duration of a break signal  is  limited
       to 15 seconds.

       <b>blanker</b>

       Activate the screen blanker. First the screen is cleared. If no blanker program is defined, the cursor is
       turned  off,  otherwise,  the  program  is  started and it's output is written to the screen.  The screen
       blanker is killed with the first keypress, the read key is discarded.

       This command is normally used together with the idle command.

       <b>blankerprg</b> [<u>program-args</u>]

       Defines a blanker program. Disables the blanker  program  if  an  empty  argument  is  given.  Shows  the
       currently set blanker program if no arguments are given.

       <b>breaktype</b> [<u>tcsendbreak</u>|<u>TIOCSBRK</u>|<u>TCSBRK</u>]

       Choose  one  of  the  available  methods  of generating a break signal for terminal devices. This command
       should affect the current window only.  But it still behaves identical  to  defbreaktype.  This  will  be
       changed  in  the  future.   Calling breaktype with no parameter displays the break method for the current
       window.

       <b>bufferfile</b> [<u>exchange-file</u>]

       Change the filename used for reading and writing with the paste buffer.  If the optional argument to  the
       bufferfile  command is omitted, the default setting (/tmp/screen-exchange) is reactivated.  The following
       example will paste the system's password file into the <u>screen</u> window (using the  paste  buffer,  where  a
       copy remains):

                   C-a : bufferfile <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>
                   C-a &lt; C-a ]
                   C-a : bufferfile

       <b>bumpleft</b>

       Swaps window with previous one on window list.

       <b>bumpright</b>

       Swaps window with next one on window list.

       <b>c1</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Change  c1  code  processing.  <b>C1</b>  <b>on</b>  tells  screen to treat the input characters between 128 and 159 as
       control functions.  Such an 8-bit code is normally the same as ESC followed by  the  corresponding  7-bit
       code.  The  default setting is to process c1 codes and can be changed with the defc1 command.  Users with
       fonts that have usable characters in the c1 positions may want to turn this off.

       <b>caption</b> <b>[</b> <b>top</b> <b>|</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>]</b> <b>always</b>|<b>splitonly</b>[<b>string</b>]

       <b>caption</b> <b>string</b> [<u>string</u>]

       This command controls the display of the window captions. Normally a caption is only used  if  more  than
       one  window  is shown on the display (split screen mode). But if the type is set to <b>always</b> screen shows a
       caption even if only one window is displayed. The default is <b>splitonly</b>.

       The second form changes the text used for the caption. You can use all escapes from  the  STRING  ESCAPES
       chapter. Screen uses a default of `%3n %t'.

       You can mix both forms by providing a string as an additional argument.

       You can have the caption displayed either at the top or bottom of the window.  The default is <b>bottom</b>.

       <b>charset</b> <u>set</u>

       Change  the  current character set slot designation and charset mapping.  The first four character of <u>set</u>
       are treated as charset designators while the fifth and sixth character must be in range '0'  to  '3'  and
       set  the  GL/GR  charset  mapping. On every position a '.' may be used to indicate that the corresponding
       charset/mapping should not be changed (<u>set</u> is padded  to  six  characters  internally  by  appending  '.'
       chars). New windows have "BBBB02" as default charset, unless a encoding command is active.
       The current setting can be viewed with the info command.

       <b>chdir</b> [<u>directory</u>]

       Change  the  <u>current</u> <u>directory</u> of <u>screen</u> to the specified directory or, if called without an argument, to
       your home directory (the value of the environment variable $HOME).  All windows that are created by means
       of the screen command from within .screenrc or by means of C-a : screen ...  or C-a c use this  as  their
       default directory.  Without a chdir command, this would be the directory from which <u>screen</u> was invoked.

       Hardcopy and log files are always written to the <u>window's</u> default directory, <u>not</u> the current directory of
       the  process  running  in the window.  You can use this command multiple times in your .screenrc to start
       various windows in different default directories, but the last chdir value will affect  all  the  windows
       you create interactively.

       <b>cjkwidth</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Treat ambiguous width characters as full/half width.

       <b>clear</b>

       Clears the current window and saves its image to the scrollback buffer.

       <b>collapse</b>

       Reorders window on window list, removing number gaps between them.

       <b>colon</b> [<u>prefix</u>]

       Allows you to enter .screenrc command lines. Useful for on-the-fly modification of key bindings, specific
       window  creation  and  changing  settings.  Note  that the set keyword no longer exists! Usually commands
       affect the current window rather than default settings for future windows. Change defaults with  commands
       starting with 'def...'.

       If  you  consider  this as the `Ex command mode' of <u>screen</u>, you may regard C-a esc (copy mode) as its `Vi
       command mode'.

       <b>command</b> <b>[</b> <b>-c</b> <u>class</u>"<b>]"</b>

       This command has the same effect as typing the screen escape character (^A). It is probably  only  useful
       for  key  bindings.   If  the  -c option is given, select the specified command class.  See also bind and
       bindkey.

       <b>compacthist</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       This tells screen whether to suppress trailing blank lines  when  scrolling  up  text  into  the  history
       buffer.

       <b>console</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Grabs or un-grabs the machines console output to a window.  <u>Note</u>: Only the owner of /dev/console can grab
       the console output.  This command is only available if the machine supports the ioctl TIOCCONS.

       <b>copy</b>

       Enter copy/scrollback mode. This allows you to copy text from the current window and its history into the
       paste buffer. In this mode a vi-like `full screen editor' is active:
       The editor's movement keys are:

       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>h</b>, <b>C-h</b>,        move the cursor left.
       <b>left</b> <b>arrow</b>
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>j</b>, <b>C-n</b>,        move the cursor down.
       <b>down</b> <b>arrow</b>
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>k</b>, <b>C-p</b>,        move the cursor up.
       <b>up</b> <b>arrow</b>
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>l</b> ('el'),      move the cursor right.
       <b>right</b> <b>arrow</b>
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>0</b> (zero) <b>C-a</b>   move to the leftmost column.
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>+</b> and <b>-</b>        positions one line up and down.
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>H</b>, <b>M</b> and <b>L</b>     move  the  cursor  to the leftmost column of the
                      top, center or bottom line of the window.
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>|</b>              moves to the specified absolute column.
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>g</b> or <b>home</b>      moves to the beginning of the buffer.
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>G</b> or <b>end</b>       moves to the specified absolute  line  (default:
                      end of buffer).
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>%</b>              jumps to the specified percentage of the buffer.
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>^</b> or <b>$</b>         move  to  the  leftmost  column, to the first or
                      last non-whitespace character on the line.
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>w</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>e</b>    move the cursor word by word.
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>           move the cursor WORD by WORD (as in vi).
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>f/F</b>, <b>t/T</b>       move the cursor  forward/backward  to  the  next
                      occurrence  of  the target. (eg, '3fy' will move
                      the cursor to the 3rd 'y' to the right.)
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>;</b> and <b>,</b>        Repeat  the  last   f/F/t/T   command   in   the
                      same/opposite direction.
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>C-e</b> and <b>C-y</b>    scroll  the  display  up/down  by one line while
                      preserving the cursor position.
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>C-u</b> and <b>C-d</b>    scroll the  display  up/down  by  the  specified
                      amount  of  lines  while  preserving  the cursor
                      position. (Default: half screen-full).
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>C-b</b> and <b>C-f</b>    scroll the display up/down a full screen.
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

       Note:  Emacs  style  movement  keys  can  be  customized  by  a  .screenrc   command.    (E.g.   markkeys
       "h=^B:l=^F:$=^E")  There  is  no  simple  method  for  a full emacs-style keymap, as this involves multi-
       character codes.

       Some keys are defined to do mark and replace operations.

       The copy range is specified by setting two marks. The text  between  these  marks  will  be  highlighted.
       Press:

              <b>space</b>  or  <b>enter</b> to set the first or second mark respectively. If <b>mousetrack</b> is set to `on', marks
              can also be set using <b>left</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>click</b>.

              <b>Y</b> and <b>y</b> used to mark one whole line or to mark from start of line.

              <b>W</b> marks exactly one word.

       Any of these commands can be prefixed with a repeat count number by pressing digits

              <b>0</b>..<b>9</b> which is taken as a repeat count.

       Example: C-a C-[ H 10 j 5 Y will copy lines 11 to 15 into the paste buffer.

       The following search keys are defined:

              <b>/</b> <u>Vi</u>-like search forward.

              <b>?</b> <u>Vi</u>-like search backward.

              <b>C-a</b> <b>s</b> <u>Emacs</u> style incremental search forward.

              <b>C-r</b> <u>Emacs</u> style reverse i-search.

              <b>n</b> Find next search pattern.

              <b>N</b> Find previous search pattern.

       There are however some keys that act differently than in <u>vi</u>.  <u>Vi</u> does not allow one to  yank  rectangular
       blocks of text, but <u>screen</u> does. Press: <b>c</b> or <b>C</b> to set the left or right margin respectively. If no repeat
       count is given, both default to the current cursor position.

       Example: Try this on a rather full text screen:

              C-a [ M 20 l SPACE c 10 l 5 j C SPACE.

       This  moves  one  to  the middle line of the screen, moves in 20 columns left, marks the beginning of the
       paste buffer, sets the left column, moves 5 columns down, sets the right column, and then marks  the  end
       of the paste buffer. Now try:

              C-a [ M 20 l SPACE 10 l 5 j SPACE

       and notice the difference in the amount of text copied.

       <b>J</b>  joins  lines.  It  toggles  between 4 modes: lines separated by a newline character (012), lines glued
       seamless, lines separated by a single whitespace and comma separated lines. Note that you can prepend the
       newline character with a carriage return character, by issuing a crlf on.

       <b>v</b> or <b>V</b> is for all the <u>vi</u> users with :set numbers - it toggles the left margin between  column  9  and  1.
       Press

       <b>a</b>  before the final space key to toggle in append mode. Thus the contents of the paste buffer will not be
       overwritten, but is appended to.

       <b>A</b> toggles in append mode and sets a (second) mark.

       <b>&gt;</b> sets the (second) mark and writes the  contents  of  the  paste  buffer  to  the  screen-exchange  file
       (/tmp/screen-exchange per default) once copy-mode is finished.

       This example demonstrates how to dump the whole scrollback buffer to that file: C-A [ g SPACE G $ &gt;.

       <b>C-g</b> gives information about the current line and column.

       <b>x</b>  or  <b>o</b>  exchanges the first mark and the current cursor position. You can use this to adjust an already
       placed mark.

       <b>C-l</b> ('el') will redraw the screen.

       <b>@</b> does nothing. Does not even exit copy mode.

       All keys not described here exit copy mode.

       <b>copy_reg</b> [<u>key</u>]

       No longer exists, use readreg instead.

       <b>crlf</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       This affects the copying of text regions with the `C-a [' command. If it is set to `on',  lines  will  be
       separated  by  the  two  character sequence `CR' - `LF'.  Otherwise (default) only `LF' is used.  When no
       parameter is given, the state is toggled.

       <b>debug</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Turns runtime debugging on or off. If <u>screen</u> has been compiled with option  -DDEBUG  debugging  available
       and  is  turned on per default. Note that this command only affects debugging output from the main SCREEN
       process correctly. Debug output from attacher processes can only be turned off once and forever.

       <b>defc1</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Same as the <b>c1</b> command except that the default setting for new windows is  changed.  Initial  setting  is
       `on'.

       <b>defautonuke</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Same as the <b>autonuke</b> command except that the default setting for new displays is changed. Initial setting
       is `off'.  Note that you can use the special `AN' terminal capability if you want to have a dependency on
       the terminal type.

       <b>defbce</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Same  as  the  <b>bce</b> command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is
       `off'.

       <b>defbreaktype</b> [<u>tcsendbreak</u>|<u>TIOCSBRK</u>|<u>TCSBRK</u>]

       Choose one of the available methods of generating a break signal  for  terminal  devices.  The  preferred
       methods  are  <u>tcsendbreak</u>  and  <u>TIOCSBRK</u>.   The third, <u>TCSBRK</u>, blocks the complete <u>screen</u> session for the
       duration of the break, but it may be the only way to generate long breaks.  <u>Tcsendbreak</u> and <u>TIOCSBRK</u>  may
       or  may  not produce long breaks with spikes (e.g. 4 per second). This is not only system-dependent, this
       also differs between serial board drivers.  Calling defbreaktype with no parameter displays  the  current
       setting.

       <b>defcharset</b> [<u>set</u>]

       Like  the  <b>charset</b>  command  except  that  the  default setting for new windows is changed. Shows current
       default if called without argument.

       <b>defdynamictitle</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Set default behaviour for new windows regarding if screen should change window title when  seeing  proper
       escape sequence. See also "TITLES (naming windows)" section.

       <b>defescape</b> <u>xy</u>

       Set  the  default command characters. This is equivalent to the escape except that it is useful multiuser
       sessions only. In a multiuser session escape changes the command character of  the  calling  user,  where
       defescape changes the default command characters for users that will be added later.

       <b>defflow</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>|</b> <b>auto</b> <b>[</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>]]</b>

       Same  as  the <b>flow</b> command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is
       `auto'.  Specifying <b>defflow</b> <b>auto</b> <b>interrupt</b> is the same as the command-line options <b>-fa</b> and <b>-i</b>.

       <b>defgr</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Same as the <b>gr</b> command except that the default setting for new windows is  changed.  Initial  setting  is
       `off'.

       <b>defhstatus</b> [<u>status</u>]

       The  hardstatus  line that all new windows will get is set to <u>status</u>.  This command is useful to make the
       hardstatus of every window display the window number or title or the like.  <u>Status</u> may contain  the  same
       directives  as  in the window messages, but the directive escape character is '^E' (octal 005) instead of
       '%'.  This was done to make a misinterpretation of program generated hardstatus lines impossible.  If the
       parameter <u>status</u> is omitted, the current default string is displayed.  Per default the hardstatus line of
       new windows is empty.

       <b>defencoding</b> <u>enc</u>

       Same as the <b>encoding</b> command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial  setting
       is the encoding taken from the terminal.

       <b>deflog</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Same  as  the  <b>log</b> command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is
       `off'.

       <b>deflogin</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Same as the <b>login</b> command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. This is initialized
       with `on' as distributed (see config.h.in).

       <b>defmode</b> <u>mode</u>

       The mode of each newly allocated pseudo-tty is set to <u>mode</u>.  <u>Mode</u> is an octal number.   When  no  defmode
       command is given, mode 0622 is used.

       <b>defmonitor</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off]</b>

       Same  as  the <b>monitor</b> command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting
       is `off'.

       <b>defmousetrack</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Same as the <b>mousetrack</b> command except that the default  setting  for  new  windows  is  changed.  Initial
       setting is `off'.

       <b>defnonblock</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>|</b> <u>numsecs</u><b>]</b>

       Same  as the <b>nonblock</b> command except that the default setting for displays is changed. Initial setting is
       `off'.

       <b>defobuflimit</b> <u>limit</u>

       Same as the <b>obuflimit</b> command except that the default  setting  for  new  displays  is  changed.  Initial
       setting  is  256 bytes.  Note that you can use the special 'OL' terminal capability if you want to have a
       dependency on the terminal type.

       <b>defscrollback</b> <u>num</u>

       Same as the <b>scrollback</b> command except that the default  setting  for  new  windows  is  changed.  Initial
       setting is 100.

       <b>defshell</b> <u>command</u>

       Synonym to the <b>shell</b> .screenrc command. See there.

       <b>defsilence</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Same  as  the <b>silence</b> command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting
       is `off'.

       <b>defslowpaste</b> <u>msec</u>

       Same as the <b>slowpaste</b> command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting
       is 0 milliseconds, meaning `off'.

       <b>defutf8</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Same as the <b>utf8</b> command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial  setting  is
       `on' if screen was started with -U, otherwise `off'.

       <b>defwrap</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Same  as the <b>wrap</b> command except that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initially line-wrap
       is on and can be toggled with the wrap command (C-a r) or by means of "C-a : wrap on|off".

       <b>defwritelock</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>|</b> <b>auto</b> <b>]</b>

       Same as the <b>writelock</b> command except that the default setting  for  new  windows  is  changed.  Initially
       writelocks will off.

       <b>detach</b> [<b>-h</b>]

       Detach the <u>screen</u> session (disconnect it from the terminal and put it into the background).  This returns
       you  to the shell where you invoked <u>screen</u>.  A detached <u>screen</u> can be resumed by invoking <u>screen</u> with the
       <b>-r</b> option (see also section COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS). The <b>-h</b> option tells screen to  immediately  close  the
       connection to the terminal (hangup).

       <b>dinfo</b>

       Show  what  screen  thinks about your terminal. Useful if you want to know why features like color or the
       alternate charset don't work.

       <b>displays</b>

       Shows a tabular listing of all currently connected user front-ends (displays).  This is most  useful  for
       multiuser sessions.  The following keys can be used in displays list:

       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>k</b>, <b>C-p</b>, or <b>up</b>           Move up one line.
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>j</b>, <b>C-n</b>, or <b>down</b>         Move down one line.
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>C-a</b> or <b>home</b>             Move to the first line.
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>C-e</b> or <b>end</b>              Move to the last line.
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>C-u</b> or <b>C-d</b>              Move one half page up or down.
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>C-b</b> or <b>C-f</b>              Move one full page up or down.
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>mouseclick</b>              Move  to the selected line. Available
                               when mousetrack is set to on.
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>space</b>                   Refresh the list
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>d</b>                       Detach that display
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>D</b>                       Power detach that display
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>C-g</b>, <b>enter</b>, or <b>escape</b>   Exit the list
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

       The following is an example of what displays could look like:
              xterm 80x42 jnweiger@/dev/ttyp4     <a href="../manm11/0.m11.html">0</a>(m11)   &amp;rWx

               (A)   (B)     (C)     (D)     (E) (F)(G)   (H)(I)

       The legend is as follows:

              (A) The terminal type known by screen for this display.

              (B) Displays geometry as width x height.

              (C) Username who is logged in at the display.

              (D) Device name of the display or the attached device

              (E) Display is in blocking or nonblocking mode.  The available modes are "nb", "NB",  "Z&lt;",  "Z&gt;",
              and "BL".

              (F) Number of the window

              (G) Name/title of window

              (H) Whether the window is shared

              (I) Window permissions. Made up of three characters.

              displays  needs  a  region  size  of at least 10 characters wide and 5 characters high in order to
              display.

       <b>digraph</b> [<u>preset</u>[<u>unicode-value</u>]]

       This command prompts the user for a digraph sequence. The next two characters typed are looked  up  in  a
       builtin  table  and  the  resulting  character  is inserted in the input stream. For example, if the user
       enters 'a"', an a-umlaut will be inserted. If the first character entered is  a  0  (zero),  <u>screen</u>  will
       treat the following characters (up to three) as an octal number instead.  The optional argument <u>preset</u> is
       treated  as  user  input, thus one can create an umlaut key.  For example the command "bindkey ^K digraph
       '"'" enables the user to generate an a-umlaut by typing CTRL-K  a.   When  a  non-zero  <u>unicode-value</u>  is
       specified,  a  new  digraph is created with the specified preset. The digraph is unset if a zero value is
       provided for the <u>unicode-value.</u>

       <b>dumptermcap</b>

       Write the termcap entry for the virtual terminal optimized for the currently active window  to  the  file
       .termcap  in  the  user's  $HOME/.screen  directory (or wherever <u>screen</u> stores its sockets. See the FILES
       section below).  This termcap entry is identical to the value of the environment variable  $TERMCAP  that
       is  set  up  by  <u>screen</u> for each window. For terminfo based systems you will need to run a converter like
       <u>captoinfo</u> and then compile the entry with <u>tic</u>.

       <b>dynamictitle</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Change behaviour for windows regarding if screen should change window title  when  seeing  proper  escape
       sequence. See also "TITLES (naming windows)" section.

       <b>echo</b> [<b>-n</b>] <u>message</u>

       The  echo command may be used to annoy <u>screen</u> users with a 'message of the day'. Typically installed in a
       global /etc/screenrc.  The option -n may be used to suppress the line feed.  See  also  sleep.   Echo  is
       also useful for online checking of environment variables.

       <b>encoding</b> <u>enc</u> [<u>enc</u>]

       Tell  <u>screen</u>  how  to  interpret  the  input/output.  The first argument sets the encoding of the current
       window. Each window can emulate a different  encoding.  The  optional  second  parameter  overwrites  the
       encoding of the connected terminal. It should never be needed as screen uses the locale setting to detect
       the  encoding.  There is also a way to select a terminal encoding depending on the terminal type by using
       the KJ termcap entry.

       Supported encodings are eucJP, SJIS, eucKR, eucCN, Big5, GBK, KOI8-R, KOI8-U, CP1251,  UTF-8,  ISO8859-2,
       ISO8859-3, ISO8859-4, ISO8859-5, ISO8859-6, ISO8859-7, ISO8859-8, ISO8859-9, ISO8859-10, ISO8859-15, jis.

       See also defencoding, which changes the default setting of a new window.

       <b>escape</b> <u>xy</u>

       Set  the  command  character to <u>x</u> and the character generating a literal command character (by triggering
       the meta command) to <u>y</u> (similar to the -e option).  Each argument is either a single  character,  a  two-
       character  sequence of the form ^x (meaning C-x), a backslash followed by an octal number (specifying the
       ASCII code of the character), or a backslash followed by a second character,  such  as  \^  or  \\.   The
       default is ^Aa.

       <b>eval</b> <u>command1</u>[<u>command2</u> <u>...</u>]

       Parses and executes each argument as separate command.

       <b>exec</b> [[<u>fdpat</u>]<u>newcommand</u> [<u>args</u> <u>...</u>]]

       Run  a  unix  subprocess  (specified  by an executable path <u>newcommand</u> and its optional arguments) in the
       current window. The flow of data between newcommands stdin/stdout/stderr, the process originally  started
       in the window (let us call it "application-process") and screen itself (window) is controlled by the file
       descriptor  pattern  fdpat.   This  pattern  is  basically a three character sequence representing stdin,
       stdout and stderr of newcommand. A dot (.) connects the file descriptor to <u>screen</u>.  An  exclamation  mark
       (!)  causes  the  file  descriptor to be connected to the application-process. A colon (:) combines both.
       User input will go to newcommand unless newcommand receives the application-process' output (fdpats first
       character is `!' or `:') or a pipe symbol (|) is added (as a fourth character) to the end of fdpat.

       Invoking `exec' without arguments shows name and arguments of the currently running  subprocess  in  this
       window. Only one subprocess a time can be running in each window.

       When a subprocess is running the `kill' command will affect it instead of the windows process.

       Refer to the postscript file `doc/fdpat.ps' for a confusing illustration of all 21 possible combinations.
       Each drawing shows the digits 2,1,0 representing the three file descriptors of newcommand. The box marked
       `W'  is  the  usual  pty  that  has the application-process on its slave side.  The box marked `P' is the
       secondary pty that now has <u>screen</u> at its master side.

       Abbreviations: Whitespace between the word `exec' and fdpat and the command can be omitted. Trailing dots
       and a fdpat consisting only of dots can be omitted. A simple `|' is synonymous for  the  pattern  `!..|';
       the word exec can be omitted here and can always be replaced by `!'.

       Examples:

              exec ... <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>

              exec <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>

              !<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>

                     Creates another shell in the same window, while the original shell is still running. Output
                     of both shells is displayed and user input is sent to the new /bin/sh.

              exec !.. stty 19200

              exec ! stty 19200

              !!stty 19200

                     Set  the  speed  of  the  window's  tty.  If your stty command operates on stdout, then add
                     another `!'.

              exec !..| less

              |less

                     This adds a pager to the window output. The special character `|' is  needed  to  give  the
                     user  control  over  the  pager  although it gets its input from the window's process. This
                     works, because <u>less</u> listens on stderr (a behavior that <u>screen</u> would not expect without  the
                     `|')  when  its stdin is not a tty.  <u>Less</u> versions newer than 177 fail miserably here; good
                     old <u>pg</u> still works.

              !:sed -n s/.*Error.*/\007/p

                     Sends window output to both, the user and the sed command. The sed  inserts  an  additional
                     bell  character  (oct.  007) to the window output seen by <u>screen</u>.  This will cause "Bell in
                     window x" messages, whenever the string "Error" appears in the window.

       <b>fit</b>

       Change the window size to the size of the current region. This command is needed because  screen  doesn't
       adapt the window size automatically if the window is displayed more than once.

       <b>flow</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>|</b> <b>auto]</b>

       Sets  the  flow-control  mode  for  this window.  Without parameters it cycles the current window's flow-
       control setting from "automatic" to "on" to "off".  See the discussion on FLOW-CONTROL later on  in  this
       document for full details and note, that this is subject to change in future releases.  Default is set by
       `defflow'.

       <b>focus</b> <b>[</b> <b>next</b> <b>|</b> <b>prev</b> <b>|</b> <b>up</b> <b>|</b> <b>down</b> <b>|</b> <b>left</b> <b>|</b> <b>right</b> <b>|</b> <b>top</b> <b>|</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>]</b>

       Move  the  input  focus  to  the next region. This is done in a cyclic way so that the top left region is
       selected after the bottom right one. If no option is given it defaults to `next'. The next region  to  be
       selected is determined by how the regions are layered.  Normally, the next region in the same layer would
       be  selected.   However, if that next region contains one or more layers, the first region in the highest
       layer is selected first. If you are at the last region of the current layer, `next' will move  the  focus
       to  the next region in the lower layer (if there is a lower layer).  `Prev' cycles in the opposite order.
       See split for more information about layers.

       The rest of the options (`up', `down', `left', `right', `top', and  `bottom')  are  more  indifferent  to
       layers.  The  option `up' will move the focus upward to the region that is touching the upper left corner
       of the current region.  `Down' will move downward to the region that is touching the lower left corner of
       the current region. The option `left' will move the focus leftward to the region  that  is  touching  the
       upper left corner of the current region, while `right' will move rightward to the region that is touching
       the  upper right corner of the current region. Moving left from a left most region or moving right from a
       right most region will result in no action.

       The option `top' will move the focus to the very first region in the upper list corner of the screen, and
       `bottom' will move to the region in the bottom right corner of the screen. Moving  up  from  a  top  most
       region or moving down from a bottom most region will result in no action.

       Useful bindings are (h, j, k, and l as in vi)
           bind h focus left
           bind j focus down
           bind k focus up
           bind l focus right
           bind t focus top
           bind b focus bottom
       Note that <b>k</b> is traditionally bound to the <u>kill</u> command.

       <b>focusminsize</b> <b>[</b> <b>(</b> <u>width</u><b>|max|_</b> <b>)</b> <b>(</b> <u>height</u><b>|max|_</b> <b>)</b> <b>]</b>

       This  forces  any  currently  selected  region  to  be automatically resized at least a certain <u>width</u> and
       <u>height</u>. All other surrounding regions will be resized in order to accommodate.  This  constraint  follows
       every  time  the  focus command is used. The resize command can be used to increase either dimension of a
       region, but never below what is set with focusminsize. The underscore `_' is a synonym for <b>max</b>. Setting a
       <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> of `0 0' (zero zero) will undo any constraints and allow for manual  resizing.   Without
       any parameters, the minimum width and height is shown.

       <b>gr</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Turn  GR  charset switching on/off. Whenever screen sees an input character with the 8th bit set, it will
       use the charset stored in the GR slot and print the character with the 8th bit stripped. The default (see
       also defgr) is not to process GR switching because otherwise the ISO88591 charset would not work.

       <b>group</b> [<u>grouptitle</u>]

       Change or show the group the current window belongs to. Windows can be  moved  around  between  different
       groups  by  specifying  the  name  of the destination group. Without specifying a group, the title of the
       current group is displayed.

       <b>hardcopy</b> [<u>-h</u>] [<u>file</u>]

       Writes out the currently displayed image to the file <u>file</u>, or, if no filename is specified, to <u>hardcopy.n</u>
       in the default directory, where <u>n</u> is the number of the current window.  This either appends or overwrites
       the file if it exists. See below.  If the  option  <b>-h</b>  is  specified,  dump  also  the  contents  of  the
       scrollback buffer.

       <b>hardcopy_append</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       If  set  to  "on",  <u>screen</u>  will append to the "hardcopy.n" files created by the command C-a h, otherwise
       these files are overwritten each time.  Default is `off'.

       <b>hardcopydir</b> <u>directory</u>

       Defines a directory where hardcopy files will be placed. If  unset,  hardcopys  are  dumped  in  <u>screen</u>'s
       current working directory.

       <b>hardstatus</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       <b>hardstatus</b> <b>[</b> <b>always</b> <b>]</b> <b>firstline</b> <b>|</b> <b>lastline</b> <b>|</b> <b>message</b> <b>|</b> <b>ignore</b> <b>[</b> <b>string</b> <b>]</b>

       <b>hardstatus</b> <b>string</b> <b>[</b> <b>string</b> <b>]</b>

       This  command  configures the use and emulation of the terminal's hardstatus line. The first form toggles
       whether <u>screen</u> will use the hardware status line to display messages. If the flag is set to `off',  these
       messages are overlaid in reverse video mode at the display line. The default setting is `on'.

       The  second  form  tells  <u>screen</u>  what  to  do  if  the terminal doesn't have a hardstatus line (i.e. the
       termcap/terminfo capabilities "hs", "ts", "fs" and "ds" are not set).  When firstline/lastline  is  used,
       <u>screen</u>  will reserve the first/last line of the display for the hardstatus. message uses <u>screen's</u> message
       mechanism and ignore tells <u>screen</u> never to display the hardstatus.  If you prepend the word always to the
       type (e.g., alwayslastline), <u>screen</u> will use the type even if the terminal supports a hardstatus.

       The third form specifies the contents of the hardstatus line.  '%h' is used as default string, i.e.,  the
       stored hardstatus of the current window (settable via ESC]0;&lt;string&gt;^G or ESC_&lt;string&gt;ESC\) is displayed.
       You  can  customize this to any string you like including the escapes from the STRING ESCAPES chapter. If
       you leave out the argument <u>string</u>, the current string is displayed.

       You can mix the second and third form by providing the string as additional argument.

       <b>height</b> [<b>-w</b>|<b>-d</b>] [<u>lines</u> [<u>cols</u>]]

       Set the display height to a specified number of lines. When no argument is given it  toggles  between  24
       and  42  lines  display.  You  can also specify a width if you want to change both values.  The <b>-w</b> option
       tells screen to leave the display size unchanged and just set the window size, <b>-d</b> vice versa.

       <b>help</b>[<u>class</u>]

       Not really a online help, but displays a help <u>screen</u> showing you all the key bindings.  The  first  pages
       list  all  the  internal  commands followed by their current bindings.  Subsequent pages will display the
       custom commands, one command per key.  Press space when you're done reading each page, or return to  exit
       early.   All  other characters are ignored. If the -c option is given, display all bound commands for the
       specified command class.  See also DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS section.

       <b>history</b>

       Usually users work with a shell that allows easy access to previous commands.  For example  csh  has  the
       command  !! to repeat the last command executed.  <u>Screen</u> allows you to have a primitive way of re-calling
       the command that started ...: You just type the first letter of that command, then hit `C-a {' and <u>screen</u>
       tries to find a previous line that matches with the `prompt character' to the left of  the  cursor.  This
       line  is  pasted  into  this window's input queue.  Thus you have a crude command history (made up by the
       visible window and its scrollback buffer).

       <b>hstatus</b> <u>status</u>

       Change the window's hardstatus line to the string <u>status</u>.

       <b>idle</b> [<u>timeout</u>[<u>cmd-args</u>]]

       Sets a command that is run after the specified number of seconds inactivity is reached. This command will
       normally be the blanker command to create a screen blanker, but it can be  any  screen  command.   If  no
       command  is  specified,  only the timeout is set. A timeout of zero (or the special timeout <b>off</b>) disables
       the timer.  If no arguments are given, the current settings are displayed.

       <b>ignorecase</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Tell screen to ignore the case of characters in searches. Default is  `off'.  Without  any  options,  the
       state of ignorecase is toggled.

       <b>info</b>

       Uses  the  message  line to display some information about the current window: the cursor position in the
       form (column,row) starting with (1,1), the terminal width and height plus  the  size  of  the  scrollback
       buffer in lines, like in (80,24)+50, the current state of window XON/XOFF flow control is shown like this
       (See also section FLOW CONTROL):
       ┌──────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
       │ +flow    │ automatic flow control, currently on.                    │
       ├──────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
       │ -flow    │ automatic flow control, currently off.                   │
       ├──────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
       │ +(+)flow │ flow control enabled. Agrees with automatic control.     │
       ├──────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
       │ -(+)flow │ flow control disabled. Disagrees with automatic control. │
       ├──────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
       │ +(-)flow │ flow control enabled. Disagrees with automatic control.  │
       ├──────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
       │ -(-)flow │ flow control disabled. Agrees with automatic control.    │
       └──────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

       The  current  line  wrap setting (`+wrap' indicates enabled, `-wrap' not) is also shown. The flags `ins',
       `org', `app', `log', `mon' or `nored' are displayed when the window  is  in  insert  mode,  origin  mode,
       application-keypad mode, has output logging, activity monitoring or partial redraw enabled.

       The currently active character set (<u>G0</u>, <u>G1</u>, <u>G2</u>, or <u>G3</u>) and in square brackets the terminal character sets
       that are currently designated as <u>G0</u> through <u>G3</u> is shown. If the window is in UTF-8 mode, the string UTF-8
       is shown instead.

       Additional  modes  depending  on  the type of the window are displayed at the end of the status line (See
       also chapter WINDOW TYPES).

       If the state machine of the terminal emulator is in a non-default state, the info line is started with  a
       string identifying the current state.

       For system information use the time command.

       <b>ins_reg</b> [<u>key</u>]

       No longer exists, use paste instead.

       <b>kill</b>

       Kill current window.

       If  there  is  an  `exec' command running then it is killed. Otherwise the process (shell) running in the
       window receives a HANGUP condition, the window structure is removed and <u>screen</u> (your display) switches to
       another window.  When the last window is destroyed, <u>screen</u> exits.  After a kill <u>screen</u>  switches  to  the
       previously displayed window.

       Note: <u>Emacs</u> users should keep this command in mind, when killing a line.  It is recommended not to use C-
       a as the <u>screen</u> escape key or to rebind kill to C-a K.

       <b>lastmsg</b>

       Redisplay  the last contents of the message/status line.  Useful if you're typing when a message appears,
       because  the message goes away when you press a key (unless your terminal has a  hardware  status  line).
       Refer to the commands msgwait and msgminwait for fine tuning.

       <b>layout</b> <b>new</b> [<u>title</u>]

       Create a new layout. The screen will change to one whole region and be switched to the blank window. From
       here, you build the regions and the windows they show as you desire. The new layout will be numbered with
       the  smallest  available integer, starting with zero. You can optionally give a title to your new layout.
       Otherwise, it will have a default title of layout. You can always change the title  later  by  using  the
       command <b>layout</b> <b>title</b>.

       <b>layout</b> <b>remove</b> [<u>n|title</u>]

       Remove,  or in other words, delete the specified layout. Either the number or the title can be specified.
       Without either specification, <u>screen</u> will remove the current layout.

       Removing a layout does not affect your set windows or regions.

       <b>layout</b> <b>next</b>

       Switch to the next layout available

       <b>layout</b> <b>prev</b>

       Switch to the previous layout available

       <b>layout</b> <b>select</b> [<u>n|title</u>]

       Select the desired layout. Either the number or the title can be specified. Without either specification,
       <u>screen</u> will prompt and ask which screen is desired. To see which layouts are available,  use  the  <b>layout</b>
       <b>show</b> command.

       <b>layout</b> <b>show</b>

       List  on  the  message  line the number(s) and title(s) of the available layout(s). The current layout is
       flagged.

       <b>layout</b> <b>title</b> [<u>title</u>]

       Change or display the title of the current layout. A string given  will  be  used  to  name  the  layout.
       Without any options, the current title and number is displayed on the message line.

       <b>layout</b> <b>number</b> [<u>n</u>]

       Change  or  display the number of the current layout. An integer given will be used to number the layout.
       Without any options, the current number and title is displayed on the message line.

       <b>layout</b> <b>attach</b> [<u>title</u>|<b>:last</b>]

       Change or display which layout to reattach back to. The default is <b>:last</b>, which tells <u>screen</u> to  reattach
       back  to  the  last  used layout just before detachment. By supplying a title, You can instruct <u>screen</u> to
       reattach to a particular layout regardless which one was used at the  time  of  detachment.  Without  any
       options, the layout to reattach to will be shown in the message line.

       <b>layout</b> <b>save</b> [<u>n|title</u>]

       Remember  the  current  arrangement  of  regions.  When  used,  <u>screen</u>  will  remember the arrangement of
       vertically and horizontally split regions.  This  arrangement  is  restored  when  a  <u>screen</u>  session  is
       reattached  or switched back from a different layout. If the session ends or the <u>screen</u> process dies, the
       layout arrangements are lost. The <b>layout</b> <b>dump</b> command should help in this situation. If a number or title
       is supplied, <u>screen</u> will remember the arrangement of that particular layout. Without any options,  <u>screen</u>
       will remember the current layout.

       Saving your regions can be done automatically by using the <b>layout</b> <b>autosave</b> command.

       <b>layout</b> <b>autosave</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off]</b>

       Change  or  display the status of automatically saving layouts. The default is <b>on</b>, meaning when <u>screen</u> is
       detached or changed to a different layout, the arrangement of regions and windows will be  remembered  at
       the  time  of  change and restored upon return.  If autosave is set to <b>off</b>, that arrangement will only be
       restored to either to the last manual save, using <b>layout</b> <b>save</b>, or to when the layout was  first  created,
       to  a single region with a single window. Without either an <b>on</b> or <b>off</b>, the current status is displayed on
       the message line.

       <b>layout</b> <b>dump</b> [<u>filename</u>]

       Write to a file the order of splits made in the current layout. This is useful to recreate the  order  of
       your  regions  used  in  your current layout. Only the current layout is recorded. While the order of the
       regions are recorded, the sizes of those regions and which windows correspond to which regions  are  not.
       If  no  filename is specified, the default is <u>layout-dump</u>, saved in the directory that the <u>screen</u> process
       was started in. If the file already exists, <b>layout</b> <b>dump</b> will append to that file. As an example:

                   C-a : layout dump /home/user/.screenrc

       will save or append the layout to the user's <u>.screenrc</u> file.

       <b>license</b>

       Display the disclaimer page. This is done whenever <u>screen</u> is started without  options,  which  should  be
       often enough. See also the <b>startup_message</b> command.

       <b>lockscreen</b>

       Lock  this  display.   Call  a  screenlock  program.   Screen does not accept any command keys until this
       program terminates. Meanwhile processes in the windows may continue, as the windows are in the `detached'
       state. The screenlock program may be changed through the environment variable $LOCKPRG (which must be set
       in the shell from which <u>screen</u> is started) and is executed with the user's uid and gid.

       Warning: When you leave other shells unlocked and you have no password set on <u>screen</u>, the lock  is  void:
       One could easily re-attach from an unlocked shell. This feature should rather be called `lockterminal'.

       <b>log</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Start/stop  writing output of the current window to a file screenlog.<u>n</u> in the window's default directory,
       where <u>n</u> is the number of the current window. This filename can be changed with the `logfile' command.  If
       no  parameter  is  given,  the  state  of logging is toggled. The session log is appended to the previous
       contents of the file if it already exists. The current  contents  and  the  contents  of  the  scrollback
       history are not included in the session log.  Default is `off'.

       <b>logfile</b> <u>filename</u>

       <b>logfile</b> <b>flush</b> <u>secs</u>

       Defines  the name the log files will get. The default is screenlog.%n. The second form changes the number
       of seconds <u>screen</u> will wait before flushing the logfile buffer to the file-system. The default  value  is
       10 seconds.

       <b>login</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Adds  or removes the entry in the utmp database file for the current window.  This controls if the window
       is `logged in'.  When no parameter is given, the login state of the window is toggled.   Additionally  to
       that  toggle,  it is convenient having a `log in' and a `log out' key. E.g. `bind I login on' and `bind O
       login off' will map these keys to be C-a I and C-a O.  The default setting (in config.h.in) should be  on
       for  a  <u>screen</u> that runs under suid-root.  Use the deflogin command to change the default login state for
       new windows. Both commands are only present when <u>screen</u> has been compiled with utmp support.

       <b>logtstamp</b> [<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]

       <b>logtstamp</b> <b>after</b> [<u>secs</u>]

       <b>logtstamp</b> <b>string</b>
       [<u>string</u>]

       This command controls logfile time-stamp mechanism of <u>screen.</u>  If time-stamps are turned on, <u>screen</u>  adds
       a  string  containing  the  current  time  to  the  logfile after two minutes of inactivity.  When output
       continues and more than another two minutes have passed, a second time-stamp is  added  to  document  the
       restart of the output. You can change this timeout with the second form of the command. The third form is
       used for customizing the time-stamp string (`-- %n:%t -- time-stamp -- %M/%d/%y %c:%s --\n' by default).

       <b>mapdefault</b>

       Tell <u>screen</u> that the next input character should only be looked up in the default bindkey table. See also
       bindkey.

       <b>mapnotnext</b>

       Like mapdefault, but don't even look in the default bindkey table.

       <u>maptimeout</u> [<u>timeout</u>]

       Set  the  inter-character  timer  for  input  sequence  detection to a timeout of <u>timeout</u> ms. The default
       timeout is 300ms. Maptimeout with no arguments shows the current setting.  See also bindkey.

       <b>markkeys</b> <u>string</u>

       This is a method of changing  the  keymap  used  for  copy/history  mode.   The  string  is  made  up  of
       <u>oldchar</u>=<u>newchar</u>  pairs which are separated by `:'. Example: The string B=^B:F=^F will change the keys `C-
       b' and `C-f' to the vi style binding (scroll up/down fill page).  This happens to be the default  binding
       for  `B' and `F'.  The command markkeys h=^B:l=^F:$=^E would set the mode for an emacs-style binding.  If
       your terminal sends characters, that cause you to abort copy mode, then this command may help by  binding
       these  characters to do nothing.  The no-op character is `@' and is used like this: markkeys @=L=H if you
       do not want to use the `H' or `L' commands any longer.  As shown in this example, multiple  keys  can  be
       assigned to one function in a single statement.

       <b>maxwin</b> <u>num</u>

       Set the maximum window number screen will create. Doesn't affect already existing windows. The number can
       be increased only when there are no existing windows.

       <b>meta</b>

       Insert the command character (C-a) in the current window's input stream.

       <b>monitor</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Toggles  activity monitoring of windows.  When monitoring is turned on and an affected window is switched
       into the background, you will receive the activity notification message in the status line at  the  first
       sign  of  output and the window will also be marked with an `@' in the window-status display.  Monitoring
       is initially off for all windows.

       <b>mousetrack</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       This command determines whether <u>screen</u> will watch for mouse clicks. When this command is enabled, regions
       that have been split in various ways can be selected by pointing to them with a mouse  and  left-clicking
       them.  Without  specifying  <b>on</b> or <b>off</b>, the current state is displayed. The default state is determined by
       the <b>defmousetrack</b> command.

       <b>msgminwait</b> <u>sec</u>

       Defines the time <u>screen</u> delays a new message when one message is currently displayed.  The default  is  1
       second.

       <b>msgwait</b> <u>sec</u>

       Defines  the  time  a message is displayed if <u>screen</u> is not disturbed by other activity. The default is 5
       seconds.

       <b>multiuser</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Switch between singleuser and multiuser mode. Standard <u>screen</u> operation is singleuser. In multiuser  mode
       the  commands  `acladd',  `aclchg', `aclgrp' and `acldel' can be used to enable (and disable) other users
       accessing this <u>screen</u> session.

       <b>nethack</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Changes the kind of error messages used by <u>screen</u>.  When you are familiar with the game nethack, you  may
       enjoy  the nethack-style messages which will often blur the facts a little, but are much funnier to read.
       Anyway, standard messages often tend to be unclear as well.
       This option is only available if <u>screen</u> was compiled with the NETHACK flag defined. The  default  setting
       is  then determined by the presence of the environment variable $NETHACKOPTIONS and the file <a href="file:~/.nethackrc">~/.nethackrc</a>
       - if either one is present, the default is <b>on</b>.

       <b>next</b>

       Switch to the next window.  This command can be used repeatedly to cycle through the list of windows.

       <b>nonblock</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>|</b> <b>numsecs</b> <b>]</b>

       Tell screen how to deal with user interfaces (displays) that cease to accept output. This can happen if a
       user presses ^S or a TCP/modem connection gets cut but no hangup is received. If nonblock is <b>off</b> (this is
       the default) screen waits until the display restarts to accept the output.  If  nonblock  is  <b>on</b>,  screen
       waits  until  the  timeout  is  reached  (<b>on</b>  is  treated  as  1s).  If the display still doesn't receive
       characters, screen will consider it blocked and stop sending  characters  to  it.  If  at  some  time  it
       restarts to accept characters, screen will unblock the display and redisplay the updated window contents.

       <b>number</b> [[+|-]<u>n</u>]

       Change the current window's number. If the given number <u>n</u> is already used by another window, both windows
       exchange  their  numbers.  If  no  argument is specified, the current window number (and title) is shown.
       Using `+' or `-' will change the window's number by the relative amount specified.

       <b>obuflimit</b> [<u>limit</u>]

       If the output buffer contains more bytes than the specified limit, no more data will  be  read  from  the
       windows. The default value is 256. If you have a fast display (like xterm), you can set it to some higher
       value. If no argument is specified, the current setting is displayed.

       <b>only</b>

       Kill all regions but the current one.

       <b>other</b>

       Switch to the window displayed previously. If this window does no longer exist, <u>other</u> has the same effect
       as <u>next</u>.

       <b>partial</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Defines  whether  the  display  should  be  refreshed  (as with <u>redisplay</u>) after switching to the current
       window. This command only affects the  current  window.   To  immediately  affect  all  windows  use  the
       <u>allpartial</u>  command.   Default  is  `off',  of  course.   This default is fixed, as there is currently no
       <u>defpartial</u> command.

       <b>password</b> [<u>crypted_pw</u>]

       Present a crypted password in your .screenrc file and <u>screen</u> will ask for it, whenever  someone  attempts
       to  resume  a detached.  This is useful if you have privileged programs running under <u>screen</u> and you want
       to protect your session from reattach attempts by  another  user  masquerading  as  your  uid  (i.e.  any
       superuser.)   If  no crypted password is specified, <u>screen</u> prompts twice for typing a password and places
       its encryption in the paste buffer.  Default is `none', this disables password checking.

       <b>paste</b> [<u>registers</u> [<u>dest_reg</u>]]

       Write the (concatenated) contents of the specified registers to the stdin queue of  the  current  window.
       The  register  '.'  is  treated  as the paste buffer. If no parameter is given the user is prompted for a
       single register to paste.  The paste buffer can be filled with the <b>copy</b>, <b>history</b>  and  <b>readbuf</b>  commands.
       Other  registers  can be filled with the <b>register</b>, <b>readreg</b> and <b>paste</b> commands.  If <b>paste</b> is called with a
       second argument, the contents of the specified registers is pasted into the  named  destination  register
       rather  than  the  window.  If  '.'  is  used  as  the  second argument, the displays paste buffer is the
       destination.  Note, that <b>paste</b> uses a wide variety of resources: Whenever a second argument is  specified
       no current window is needed. When the source specification only contains registers (not the paste buffer)
       then there need not be a current display (terminal attached), as the registers are a global resource. The
       paste buffer exists once for every user.

       <b>pastefont</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Tell <u>screen</u> to include font information in the paste buffer. The default is not to do so. This command is
       especially useful for multi character fonts like kanji.

       <b>pow_break</b>

       Reopen the window's terminal line and send a break condition. See `break'.

       <b>pow_detach</b>

       Power detach.  Mainly the same as <u>detach</u>, but also sends a HANGUP signal to the parent process of <u>screen</u>.
       CAUTION: This will result in a logout, when <u>screen</u> was started from your login-shell.

       <b>pow_detach_msg</b> [<u>message</u>]

       The  <u>message</u>  specified  here  is  output  whenever  a  `Power detach' was performed. It may be used as a
       replacement for a logout message or to reset baud rate, etc.  Without parameter, the current  message  is
       shown.

       <b>prev</b>

       Switch  to  the  window with the next lower number.  This command can be used repeatedly to cycle through
       the list of windows.

       <b>printcmd</b> [<u>cmd</u>]

       If <u>cmd</u> is not an empty string, <u>screen</u> will not use the terminal capabilities po/pf if it detects an  ansi
       print  sequence  <b>ESC</b>  <b>[</b> <b>5</b> <b>i</b>, but pipe the output into <u>cmd</u>.  This should normally be a command like lpr or
       <b>printcmd</b> without a command displays the current setting.  The ansi sequence <b>ESC</b> <b>[</b> <b>4</b> <b>i</b> ends  printing  and
       closes the pipe.

       Warning:  Be  careful  with  this command! If other user have write access to your terminal, they will be
       able to fire off print commands.

       <b>process</b> [<u>key</u>]

       Stuff the contents of the specified register into <u>screen</u>'s input queue. If no argument is given  you  are
       prompted  for  a  register  name. The text is parsed as if it had been typed in from the user's keyboard.
       This command can be used to bind multiple actions to a single key.

       <b>quit</b>

       Kill all windows and terminate <u>screen</u>.  Note that on VT100-style terminals  the  keys  C-4  and  C-\  are
       identical.   This  makes  the  default  bindings dangerous: Be careful not to type C-a C-4 when selecting
       window no. 4.  Use the empty bind command (as in bind '^\') to remove a key binding.

       <b>readbuf</b> [<u>encoding</u>] [<u>filename</u>]

       Reads the contents of the specified file into the paste buffer.  You can tell screen the encoding of  the
       file  via  the  <b>-e</b>  option.   If  no  file  is specified, the screen-exchange filename is used.  See also
       <b>bufferfile</b> command.

       <b>readreg</b> [<u>encoding</u>] [<u>register</u> [<u>filename</u>]]

       Does one of two things, dependent on number of arguments: with zero or one arguments  it  duplicates  the
       paste  buffer  contents into the register specified or entered at the prompt. With two arguments it reads
       the contents of the named file into the register, just as <u>readbuf</u> reads the screen-exchange file into the
       paste buffer.  You can tell screen the encoding of the file via the <b>-e</b>  option.   The  following  example
       will paste the system's password file into the <u>screen</u> window (using register p, where a copy remains):

                   C-a : readreg p <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>
                   C-a : paste p

       <b>redisplay</b>

       Redisplay the current window. Needed to get a full redisplay when in partial redraw mode.

       <b>register</b> [<b>-e</b><u>encoding</u>]<u>key-string</u>

       Save  the  specified  <u>string</u> to the register <u>key</u>.  The encoding of the string can be specified via the <b>-e</b>
       option.  See also the paste command.

       <b>remove</b>

       Kill the current region. This is a no-op if there is only one region.

       <b>removebuf</b>

       Unlinks the screen-exchange file used by the commands <b>writebuf</b> and <b>readbuf</b>.

       <b>rendition</b> <b>[</b> <b>bell</b> <b>|</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>|</b> <b>silence</b> <b>|</b> <b>so</b> <b>]</b> <b>attr</b> <b>[</b> <b>color</b> <b>]</b>

       Change the way <u>screen</u> renders the titles of windows that have monitor or bell flags  set  in  caption  or
       hardstatus  or  windowlist.  See the STRING ESCAPES chapter for the syntax of the modifiers.  The default
       for monitor is currently =b  (bold, active colors), for bell =ub  (underline, bold  and  active  colors),
       and =u for silence.

       <b>reset</b>

       Reset  the  virtual terminal to its power-on values. Useful when strange settings (like scroll regions or
       graphics character set) are left over from an application.

       <b>resize</b> [<b>-h</b>|<b>-v</b>|<b>-b</b>|<b>-l</b>|<b>-p</b>] [[<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>] <u>n</u>[%] |<b>=</b>|<b>max</b>|<b>min</b>|<b>_</b>|<b>0</b>]

       Resize the current region. The space will be removed from or added to the surrounding  regions  depending
       on  the  order  of  the splits.  The available options for resizing are `-h'(horizontal), `-v'(vertical),
       `-b'(both), `-l'(local to layer), and `-p'(perpendicular). Horizontal resizes will add or remove width to
       a region, vertical will add or remove height, and both will add or  remove  size  from  both  dimensions.
       Local  and perpendicular are similar to horizontal and vertical, but they take in account of how a region
       was split.  If a region's last split was horizontal, a local resize will work like a vertical resize.  If
       a  region's  last  split  was  vertical, a local resize will work like a horizontal resize. Perpendicular
       resizes work in opposite of local resizes. If no option is specified, local is the default.

       The amount of lines to add or remove can be expressed a couple of different ways. By specifying a  number
       <u>n</u>  by  itself  will  resize  the  region  by  that  absolute amount. You can specify a relative amount by
       prefixing a plus `+' or minus `-' to the amount, such as adding +<u>n</u> lines or removing -<u>n</u>  lines.  Resizing
       can  also be expressed as an absolute or relative percentage by postfixing a percent sign `%'. Using zero
       `0' is a synonym for `min' and using an underscore `_' is a synonym for `max'.

       Some examples are:

       resize +N
              increase current region by N

       resize -N
              decrease current region by N

       resize  N
              set current region to N

       resize 20%
              set current region to 20% of original size

       resize +20%
              increase current region by 20%

       resize -b =
              make all windows equally

       resize  max
              maximize current region

       resize  min
              minimize current region

       Without any arguments, <u>screen</u> will prompt for how you would like to resize the current region.

       See focusminsize if you want to restrict the minimum size a region can have.

       <b>screen</b> [<u>-opts</u>] [<u>n</u>] [<u>cmd</u> [<u>args</u>]|<b>//group</b>]

       Establish a new window.  The flow-control options (<b>-f</b>, <b>-fn</b> and <b>-fa</b>), title (a.k.a.)  option  (<b>-t</b>),  login
       options  (<b>-l</b>  and  <b>-ln</b>)  ,  terminal type option (<b>-T</b> &lt;term&gt;), the all-capability-flag (<b>-a</b>) and scrollback
       option (<b>-h</b> &lt;num&gt;) may be specified with each command.  The option  (<b>-M</b>)  turns  monitoring  on  for  this
       window.   The  option (<b>-L</b>) turns output logging on for this window.  If an optional number <u>n</u> in the range
       0..MAXWIN-1 is given, the window number <u>n</u> is assigned to the newly created window (or, if this number  is
       already  in-use,  the next available number).  If a command is specified after screen, this command (with
       the given arguments) is started in the window; otherwise, a shell is created.  If <b>//group</b> is supplied,  a
       container-type window is created in which other windows may be created inside it.

       Thus, if your .screenrc contains the lines

                   # example for .screenrc:
                   screen 1
                   screen -fn -t foobar -L 2 telnet foobar

       <u>screen</u>  creates a shell window (in window #1) and a window with a TELNET connection to the machine foobar
       (with no flow-control using the title foobar in window #2) and will write a logfile (screenlog.2) of  the
       telnet  session.   Note,  that unlike previous versions of <u>screen</u> no additional default window is created
       when screen commands are included in your .screenrc file. When the initialization  is  completed,  <u>screen</u>
       switches to the last window specified in your .screenrc file or, if none, opens a default window #0.

       Screen has built in some functionality of cu and telnet.  See also chapter WINDOW TYPES.

       <b>scrollback</b> <u>num</u>

       Set the size of the scrollback buffer for the current windows to <u>num</u> lines. The default scrollback is 100
       lines.   See  also  the defscrollback command and use info to view the current setting. To access and use
       the contents in the scrollback buffer, use the copy command.

       <b>select</b> [<u>WindowID</u>]

       Switch to the window identified by <u>WindowID</u>.  This can be a prefix of a window title (alphanumeric window
       name) or a window number.  The parameter is optional and if omitted, you get prompted for an  identifier.
       When a new window is established, the first available number is assigned to this window.  Thus, the first
       window  can be activated by select 0.  The number of windows is set by the MAXWIN configuration parameter
       (which defaults to 100), but it can be  changed  by  using  `maxwin'  command.   There  are  two  special
       WindowIDs,  - selects the internal blank window and . selects the current window. The latter is useful if
       used with screen's -X option.

       <b>sessionname</b> [<u>name</u>]

       Rename the current session. Note, that for screen -list the name shows up with the process-id  prepended.
       If  the  argument  name  is omitted, the name of this session is displayed. Caution: The $STY environment
       variables will still reflect the old name in pre-existing shells. This may result in  confusion.  Use  of
       this  command is generally discouraged. Use the -S command-line option if you want to name a new session.
       The default is constructed from the tty and host names.

       <b>setenv</b> [<u>var</u> [<u>string</u>]]

       Set the environment variable <u>var</u> to value <u>string</u>.  If only <u>var</u> is specified, the user will be prompted to
       enter a value.  If no parameters are specified, the user will be prompted for both  variable  and  value.
       The environment is inherited by all subsequently forked shells.

       <b>setsid</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Normally screen uses different sessions and process groups for the windows. If setsid is turned <u>off</u>, this
       is not done anymore and all windows will be in the same process group as the screen backend process. This
       also  breaks  job-control,  so be careful.  The default is <u>on</u>, of course. This command is probably useful
       only in rare circumstances.

       <b>shell</b> <u>command</u>

       Set the command to be used to create a new shell.  This overrides the value of the  environment  variable
       $SHELL.   This  is  useful  if you'd like to run a tty-enhancer which is expecting to execute the program
       specified in $SHELL.  If the command begins with a '-' character, the shell will be started as  a  login-
       shell.  Typical  shells do only minimal initialization when not started as a login-shell.  E.g. Bash will
       not read your <a href="file:~/.bash_profile">~/.bash_profile</a> unless it is a login-shell.

       <b>shelltitle</b> <u>title</u>

       Set the title for all shells created during startup or by the C-A C-c command.  For details about what  a
       title is, see the discussion entitled TITLES (naming windows).

       <b>silence</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>|</b> <b>sec</b> <b>]</b>

       Toggles silence monitoring of windows.  When silence is turned on and an affected window is switched into
       the  background,  you  will receive the silence notification message in the status line after a specified
       period of inactivity (silence). The default timeout can be changed with the `silencewait' command  or  by
       specifying a number of seconds instead of `on' or `off'.  Silence is initially off for all windows.

       <b>silencewait</b> <u>sec</u>

       Define  the  time that all windows monitored for silence should wait before displaying a message. Default
       30 seconds.

       <b>sleep</b> <u>num</u>

       This command will pause the execution of a .screenrc file for <u>num</u> seconds.  Keyboard  activity  will  end
       the sleep.  It may be used to give users a chance to read the messages output by echo.

       <b>slowpaste</b> <u>msec</u>

       Define  the  speed  at which text is inserted into the current window by the paste ("C-a ]") command.  If
       the slowpaste value is nonzero text is written character by character.  <u>screen</u> will make a pause of  <u>msec</u>
       milliseconds  after  each  single character write to allow the application to process its input. Only use
       slowpaste if your underlying system exposes flow control problems while pasting large amounts of text.

       <b>sort</b>

       Sort the windows in alphabetical order of the window tiles.

       <b>source</b> <u>file</u>

       Read and execute commands from file <u>file</u>. Source commands may be nested to a maximum recursion  level  of
       ten.  If  file  is  not  an  absolute  path and screen is already processing a source command, the parent
       directory of the running source command file is used to search for the new command file  before  screen's
       current directory.

       Note  that  termcap/terminfo/termcapinfo commands only work at startup and reattach time, so they must be
       reached via the default screenrc files to have an effect.

       <b>sorendition</b> [<u>attr</u>[<u>color</u>]]

       This command is deprecated. See "rendition so" instead.

       <b>split</b>[<b>-v</b>]

       Split the current region into two new ones. All regions on the display are resized to make room  for  the
       new region. The blank window is displayed in the new region. The default is to create a horizontal split,
       putting  the  new  regions  on the top and bottom of each other. Using `-v' will create a vertical split,
       causing the new regions to appear side by side of each other.  Use the remove  or  the  only  command  to
       delete regions.  Use focus to toggle between regions.

       When  a  region  is  split  opposite of how it was previously split (that is, vertical then horizontal or
       horizontal then vertical), a new layer is created. The layer is used to group together the  regions  that
       are split the same. Normally, as a user, you should not see nor have to worry about layers, but they will
       affect how some commands (focus and resize) behave.

       With  this current implementation of screen, scrolling data will appear much slower in a vertically split
       region than one that is not. This should be taken into consideration if you need to use  system  commands
       such as <b>cat</b> or <b>tail</b> <b>-f</b>.

       <b>startup_message</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Select  whether  you  want  to see the copyright notice during startup.  Default is `on', as you probably
       noticed.

       <b>status</b> <b>[</b> <b>top</b> <b>|</b> <b>up</b> <b>|</b> <b>down</b> <b>|</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>left</b> <b>|</b> <b>right</b> <b>]</b>

       The status window by default is in bottom-left corner. This command  can  move  status  messages  to  any
       corner of the screen. <b>top</b> is the same as <b>up</b>, <b>down</b> is the same as <b>bottom</b>.

       <b>stuff</b> [<u>string</u>]

       Stuff  the  string  <u>string</u> in the input buffer of the current window.  This is like the paste command but
       with much less overhead.  Without a parameter, screen will prompt for a  string  to  stuff.   You  cannot
       paste large buffers with the stuff command. It is most useful for key bindings. See also bindkey.

       <b>su</b> [<u>username</u> [<u>password</u> [<u>password2</u>]]]

       Substitute  the  user of a display. The command prompts for all parameters that are omitted. If passwords
       are specified as parameters, they have to be specified un-crypted. The first password is matched  against
       the  systems  passwd database, the second password is matched against the <u>screen</u> password as set with the
       commands acladd or password.  Su may be useful for the <u>screen</u> administrator  to  test  multiuser  setups.
       When  the identification fails, the user has access to the commands available for user <b>nobody</b>.  These are
       detach, license, version, help and displays.

       <b>suspend</b>

       Suspend <u>screen</u>.  The windows are in the `detached' state, while <u>screen</u> is suspended. This feature  relies
       on the shell being able to do job control.

       <b>term</b> <u>term</u>

       In  each  window's environment <u>screen</u> opens, the $TERM variable is set to screen by default.  But when no
       description for screen is installed in the local termcap or terminfo data base, you set $TERM to - say  -
       vt100.  This  won't  do  much  harm,  as <u>screen</u> is VT100/ANSI compatible.  The use of the term command is
       discouraged for non-default purpose.  That is, one may want  to  specify  special  $TERM  settings  (e.g.
       vt100)  for  the  next  screen  rlogin  othermachine  command.  Use  the  command  screen -T vt100 rlogin
       othermachine rather than setting and resetting the default.

       <b>termcap</b> <u>term</u> <u>terminal-tweaks</u>[<u>window-tweaks]</u>

       <b>terminfo</b> <u>term</u> <u>terminal-tweaks</u>[<u>window-tweaks]</u>

       <b>termcapinfo</b> <u>term</u> <u>terminal-tweaks</u>[<u>window-tweaks]</u>

       Use this command to modify your terminal's termcap entry without going through all the  hassles  involved
       in  creating  a  custom  termcap entry.  Plus, you can optionally customize the termcap generated for the
       windows.  You have to place these commands in one of the screenrc startup files, as they are  meaningless
       once the terminal emulator is booted.

       If  your  system  uses  the  terminfo database rather than termcap, <u>screen</u> will understand the `terminfo'
       command, which has the same effects as the `termcap' command.  Two separate  commands  are  provided,  as
       there  are  subtle syntactic differences, e.g. when parameter interpolation (using `%') is required. Note
       that termcap names of the capabilities have to be used with the `terminfo' command.

       In many cases, where the arguments are valid in both terminfo and termcap syntax, you can use the command
       `termcapinfo', which is just a shorthand for a pair of `termcap' and `terminfo' commands  with  identical
       arguments.

       The  first  argument  specifies which terminal(s) should be affected by this definition.  You can specify
       multiple terminal names by separating them with `|'s.  Use `*' to match all terminals and `vt*' to  match
       all terminals that begin with vt.

       Each  <u>tweak</u> argument contains one or more termcap defines (separated by `:'s) to be inserted at the start
       of the appropriate termcap entry, enhancing it or overriding existing values.  The first  tweak  modifies
       your  terminal's  termcap, and contains definitions that your terminal uses to perform certain functions.
       Specify a null string to leave this unchanged (e.g. '').  The second (optional) tweak  modifies  all  the
       window  termcaps,  and  should  contain  definitions  that  <u>screen</u>  understands (see the VIRTUAL TERMINAL
       section).

       Some examples:

              termcap xterm*  LP:hs@

       Informs <u>screen</u> that all terminals that begin with `xterm' have firm  auto-margins  that  allow  the  last
       position on the screen to be updated (LP), but they don't really have a status line (no 'hs' - append `@'
       to  turn  entries  off).  Note that we assume `LP' for all terminal names that start with vt, but only if
       you don't specify a termcap command for that terminal.
              termcap vt*  LP

       termcap vt102|vt220  Z0=\E[?3h:Z1=\E[?3l

       Specifies the firm-margined `LP' capability for all terminals that begin with `vt', and the  second  line
       will  also  add the escape-sequences to switch into (Z0) and back out of (Z1) 132-character-per-line mode
       if this is a VT102 or VT220.  (You must specify Z0 and Z1 in  your  termcap  to  use  the  width-changing
       commands.)

              termcap vt100  ""  l0=PF1:l1=PF2:l2=PF3:l3=PF4

       This leaves your vt100 termcap alone and adds the function key labels to each window's termcap entry.

              termcap h19|z19  am@:im=\E@:ei=\EO  dc=\E[P

       Takes  a  h19  or  z19 termcap and turns off auto-margins (am@) and enables the insert mode (im) and end-
       insert (ei) capabilities (the `@' in the `im' string is after the `=', so it  is  part  of  the  string).
       Having  the `im' and `ei' definitions put into your terminal's termcap will cause <u>screen</u> to automatically
       advertise the character-insert capability in each window's  termcap.   Each  window  will  also  get  the
       delete-character capability (dc) added to its termcap, which <u>screen</u> will translate into a line-update for
       the terminal (we're pretending it doesn't support character deletion).

       If  you  would  like  to fully specify each window's termcap entry, you should instead set the $SCREENCAP
       variable prior to running <u>screen</u>.  See the discussion on the VIRTUAL TERMINAL in  this  manual,  and  the
       <a href="../man5/termcap.5.html">termcap</a>(5) man page for more information on termcap definitions.

       <b>time</b>   [<u>string</u>]

       Uses  the message line to display the time of day, the host name, and the load averages over 1, 5, and 15
       minutes (if this is available on your system).  For window specific information, use info.

       If a string is specified, it changes the format of the time report like it is  described  in  the  STRING
       ESCAPES chapter. Screen uses a default of "%c:%s %M %d %H%? %l%?".

       <b>title</b> [<u>windowtitle</u>]

       Set  the name of the current window to <u>windowtitle</u>. If no name is specified, <u>screen</u> prompts for one. This
       command was known as `aka' in previous releases.

       <b>unbindall</b>

       Unbind all the bindings. This can be useful when screen is used solely for its detaching abilities,  such
       as  when  letting  a  console  application  run as a daemon. If, for some reason, it is necessary to bind
       commands after this, use 'screen -X'.

       <b>unsetenv</b> <u>var</u>

       Unset an environment variable.

       <b>utf8</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]]</b>

       Change the encoding used in the current window. If utf8 is enabled, the strings sent to the  window  will
       be  UTF-8  encoded  and  vice versa. Omitting the parameter toggles the setting. If a second parameter is
       given, the display's encoding is also changed (this should rather be done with screen's -U option).   See
       also defutf8, which changes the default setting of a new window.

       <b>vbell</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Sets  the  visual  bell  setting for this window. Omitting the parameter toggles the setting. If vbell is
       switched on, but your terminal does not support a visual bell, a  `vbell-message'  is  displayed  in  the
       status  line  when  the bell character (^G) is received.  Visual bell support of a terminal is defined by
       the termcap variable `vb' (terminfo: 'flash').

       Per default, vbell is off, thus the audible bell is used.  See also `bell_msg'.

       <b>vbell_msg</b> [<u>message</u>]

       Sets the visual bell message. <u>message</u> is printed to the  status  line  if  the  window  receives  a  bell
       character (^G), vbell is set to on, but the terminal does not support a visual bell.  The default message
       is Wuff, Wuff!!.  Without a parameter, the current message is shown.

       <b>vbellwait</b> <u>sec</u>

       Define a delay in seconds after each display of <u>screen</u>'s visual bell message. The default is 1 second.

       <b>verbose</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       If  verbose is switched on, the command name is echoed, whenever a window is created (or resurrected from
       zombie state). Default is off.  Without a parameter, the current setting is shown.

       <b>version</b>

       Print the current version and the compile date in the status line.

       <b>wall</b> <u>message</u>

       Write a message to all displays. The message will appear in the terminal's status line.

       <b>width</b> [<b>-w</b>|<b>-d</b>] [<u>cols</u> [<u>lines</u>]]

       Toggle the window width between 80 and 132 columns or set it to <u>cols</u> columns if an argument is specified.
       This requires a capable terminal and the termcap entries Z0 and Z1.  See the  termcap  command  for  more
       information.  You  can  also specify a new height if you want to change both values.  The <b>-w</b> option tells
       screen to leave the display size unchanged and just set the window size, <b>-d</b> vice versa.

       <b>windowlist</b> <b>[</b> <b>-b</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-m</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-g</b> <b>]</b>

       <b>windowlist</b> <b>string</b> [<u>string</u>]

       <b>windowlist</b> <b>title</b> [<u>title</u>]

       Display all windows in a table for visual window selection.  If screen was in a window group, screen will
       back out of the group and then display the windows in that group.  If the <b>-b</b> option is given, screen will
       switch to the blank window before presenting the list, so that the current  window  is  also  selectable.
       The  <b>-m</b>  option  changes  the  order of the windows, instead of sorting by window numbers screen uses its
       internal most-recently-used list.  The <b>-g</b> option will show the windows inside any groups  in  that  level
       and downwards.

       The following keys are used to navigate in windowlist:

       ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>k</b>, <b>C-p</b>, or <b>up</b>      Move up one line.
       ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

       ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>space</b> or <b>enter</b>     Select that window.
       ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

       The table format can be changed with the <b>string</b> and  <b>title</b>  option,  the  title  is  displayed  as  table
       heading, while the lines are made by using the string setting. The default setting is Num Name%=Flags for
       the  title  and  %3n  %t%=%f  for  the  lines.  See the STRING ESCAPES chapter for more codes (e.g. color
       settings).

       Windowlist needs a region size of at least 10 characters wide and 6 characters high in order to display.

       <b>windows</b> <b>[</b> <b>string</b> <b>]</b>

       Uses the message line to display a list of all the windows.  Each window is listed  by  number  with  the
       name  of  process that has been started in the window (or its title); the current window is marked with a
       `*'; the previous window is marked with a `-'; all the windows that are logged in are marked with a  `$';
       a  background  window  that  has  received a bell is marked with a `!'; a background window that is being
       monitored and has had activity occur is marked with an `@'; a window which has output logging  turned  on
       is  marked  with  `(L)'; windows occupied by other users are marked with `&amp;'; windows in the zombie state
       are marked with `Z'.  If this list is too long to fit on the terminal's  status  line  only  the  portion
       around the current window is displayed.  The optional string parameter follows the STRING ESCAPES format.
       If  string  parameter is passed, the output size is unlimited.  The default command without any parameter
       is limited to a size of 1024 bytes.

       <b>wrap</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>]</b>

       Sets the line-wrap setting for the  current  window.   When  line-wrap  is  on,  the  second  consecutive
       printable character output at the last column of a line will wrap to the start of the following line.  As
       an added feature, backspace (^H) will also wrap through the left margin to the previous line.  Default is
       `on'. Without any options, the state of wrap is toggled.

       <b>writebuf</b> [<b>-e</b> <u>encoding</u>] [<u>filename</u>]

       Writes  the  contents of the paste buffer to the specified file, or the public accessible screen-exchange
       file if no filename is given. This is thought of as a primitive means  of  communication  between  <u>screen</u>
       users  on  the same host. If an encoding is specified the paste buffer is recoded on the fly to match the
       encoding.  The filename can be set with the <u>bufferfile</u> command and defaults to /tmp/screen-exchange.

       <b>writelock</b> <b>[</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>|</b> <b>auto]</b>

       In addition to access control lists, not all users may be able to write to the same window at  once.  Per
       default,  writelock  is in `auto' mode and grants exclusive input permission to the user who is the first
       to switch to the particular window. When he leaves the window,  other  users  may  obtain  the  writelock
       (automatically).  The  writelock  of  the current window is disabled by the command writelock off. If the
       user issues the command writelock on he keeps the exclusive write permission  while  switching  to  other
       windows.

       <b>xoff</b>

       <b>xon</b>

       Insert a CTRL-s / CTRL-q character to the stdin queue of the current window.

       <b>zmodem</b> <b>[</b> <b>off</b> <b>|</b> <b>auto</b> <b>|</b> <b>catch</b> <b>|</b> <b>pass</b> <b>]</b>

       <b>zmodem</b> <b>sendcmd</b> [<u>string</u>]

       <b>zmodem</b> <b>recvcmd</b> [<u>string</u>]

       Define  zmodem  support  for  screen.  Screen  understands  two  different modes when it detects a zmodem
       request: pass and catch.  If the mode is set to pass, screen will relay all data to  the  attacher  until
       the  end  of  the transmission is reached.  In catch mode screen acts as a zmodem endpoint and starts the
       corresponding rz/sz commands. If the mode is set to auto, screen will use catch if the window  is  a  tty
       (e.g. a serial line), otherwise it will use pass.

       You can define the templates screen uses in catch mode via the second and the third form.

       Note also that this is an experimental feature.

       <b>zombie</b> [<u>keys</u><b>[</b>onerror<b>]</b>]

       Per  default  <u>screen</u> windows are removed from the window list as soon as the windows process (e.g. shell)
       exits. When a string of two keys is specified to the zombie command, `dead' windows will  remain  in  the
       list.   The  <b>kill</b>  command may be used to remove such a window. Pressing the first key in the dead window
       has the same effect. When pressing the second key, <u>screen</u> will  attempt  to  resurrect  the  window.  The
       process  that  was  initially  running  in  the  window  will  be  launched again. Calling <b>zombie</b> without
       parameters will clear the zombie setting, thus making windows disappear when their process exits.

       As the zombie-setting is manipulated globally for all windows, this command  should  probably  be  called
       <b>defzombie</b>, but it isn't.

       Optionally  you can put the word onerror after the keys. This will cause screen to monitor exit status of
       the process running in the window. If it exits normally ('0'), the  window  disappears.  Any  other  exit
       value causes the window to become a zombie.

       <b>zombie_timeout</b>[<u>seconds</u>]

       Per  default  <u>screen</u> windows are removed from the window list as soon as the windows process (e.g. shell)
       exits. If <b>zombie</b> keys are defined (compare with above <b>zombie</b> command), it  is  possible  to  also  set  a
       timeout when screen tries to automatically reconnect a dead screen window.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>MESSAGE</b> <b>LINE</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Screen</u>  displays  informational  messages  and  other  diagnostics in a <u>message</u> <u>line</u>.  While this line is
       distributed to appear at the bottom of the screen, it can be defined to appear at the top of  the  screen
       during  compilation.  If your terminal has a status line defined in its termcap, <u>screen</u> will use this for
       displaying its messages, otherwise a line of the current  screen  will  be  temporarily  overwritten  and
       output  will  be  momentarily  interrupted. The message line is automatically removed after a few seconds
       delay, but it can also be removed early (on terminals without a status line) by beginning to type.

       The message line facility can be used by an application running in the current window  by  means  of  the
       ANSI <u>Privacy</u> <u>message</u> control sequence.  For instance, from within the shell, try something like:

              echo '&lt;esc&gt;^Hello world from window '$WINDOW'&lt;esc&gt;\\'

       where '&lt;esc&gt;' is an <u>escape</u>, '^' is a literal up-arrow, and '\\' turns into a single backslash.

</pre><h4><b>WINDOW</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       Screen  provides  three different window types. New windows are created with <u>screen</u>'s <b>screen</b> command (see
       also the entry in chapter CUSTOMIZATION). The first parameter to the <b>screen</b> command defines which type of
       window is created. The different window types are all special cases of the normal type.  They  have  been
       added in order to allow <u>screen</u> to be used efficiently as a console multiplexer with 100 or more windows.

       •  The  normal  window  contains  a shell (default, if no parameter is given) or any other system command
          that could be executed from a shell (e.g.  <b>slogin</b>, etc...)

       •  If a tty (character special device) name (e.g. /dev/ttya) is specified as the  first  parameter,  then
          the  window  is  directly  connected  to  this  device.   This  window type is similar to screen cu -l
          /dev/ttya.  Read and write access is required on the device node, an exclusive open  is  attempted  on
          the  node to mark the connection line as busy.  An optional parameter is allowed consisting of a comma
          separated list of flags in the notation used by <a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a>(1):

          &lt;baud_rate&gt;
                 Usually 300, 1200, 9600 or 19200. This affects transmission as well as receive speed.

          cs8 or cs7
                 Specify the transmission of eight (or seven) bits per byte.

          cstopb or -cstopb
                 Specify two stop bits per character (one with '-')

          parenb or -parenb
                 Generate parity bit in output and expect parity bit in input

          parodd or -parodd
                 Set odd parity (or even parity with '-')

          ixon or -ixon
                 Enables (or disables) software flow-control (CTRL-S/CTRL-Q) for sending data.

          ixoff or -ixoff
                 Enables (or disables) software flow-control for receiving data.

          istrip or -istrip
                 Clear (or keep) the eight bit in each received byte.

          You may want to specify as many of these options as applicable. Unspecified options cause the terminal
          driver to make up the parameter values of the connection.  These values are system dependent  and  may
          be in defaults or values saved from a previous connection.

          For  tty windows, the <b>info</b> command shows some of the modem control lines in the status line. These may
          include `RTS', `CTS', 'DTR', `DSR', `CD' and more.  This depends on the available ioctl()'s and system
          header files as well as the on the physical capabilities  of  the  serial  board.   Signals  that  are
          logical  low  (inactive)  have their name preceded by an exclamation mark (!), otherwise the signal is
          logical high (active).  Signals not supported by the hardware but available to the  ioctl()  interface
          are usually shown low.

          When  the  CLOCAL  status bit is true, the whole set of modem signals is placed inside curly braces ({
          and }).  When the CRTSCTS or TIOCSOFTCAR  bit  is  set,  the  signals  `CTS'  or  `CD'  are  shown  in
          parenthesis, respectively.

          For  tty  windows, the command <b>break</b> causes the Data transmission line (TxD) to go low for a specified
          period of time. This is expected to be interpreted as break signal on the other side.  No data is sent
          and no modem control line is changed when a <b>break</b> is issued.

       •  If the first parameter is //telnet, the second parameter is  expected  to  be  a  host  name,  and  an
          optional third parameter may specify a TCP port number (default decimal 23).  Screen will connect to a
          server listening on the remote host and use the telnet protocol to communicate with that server.

       For  telnet  windows, the command <b>info</b> shows details about the connection in square brackets ([ and ]) at
       the end of the status line.

              b      BINARY. The connection is in binary mode.

              e      ECHO. Local echo is disabled.

              c      SGA. The connection is in `character mode' (default: `line mode').

              t      TTYPE. The terminal type has been requested by the remote  host.   Screen  sends  the  name
                     screen unless instructed otherwise (see also the command `term').

              w      NAWS. The remote site is notified about window size changes.

              f      LFLOW. The remote host will send flow control information.  (Ignored at the moment.)

              Additional flags for debugging are x, t and n (XDISPLOC, TSPEED and NEWENV).

              For  telnet windows, the command <b>break</b> sends the telnet code IAC BREAK (decimal 243) to the remote
              host.

              This window type is only available if <u>screen</u> was compiled with the ENABLE_TELNET option defined.

</pre><h4><b>STRING</b> <b>ESCAPES</b></h4><pre>
       Screen provides an escape mechanism to insert information like the current time  into  messages  or  file
       names.  The  escape  character  is '%' with one exception: inside of a window's hardstatus '^%' ('^E') is
       used instead.

       Here is the full list of supported escapes:

       %      the escape character itself

       E      sets %? to true if the escape character has been pressed.

       e      encoding

       f      flags of the window, see windows for meanings of the various flags

       F      sets %? to true if the window has the focus

       h      hardstatus of the window

       H      hostname of the system

       n      window number

       P      sets %? to true if the current region is in copy/paste mode

       S      session name

       s      window size

       t      window title

       w      all window numbers and names. With '-' qualifier: up to the current window;  with  '+'  qualifier:
              starting with the window after the current one.

       W      all window numbers and names except the current one

       =      pad  the  string  to  the display's width (like TeX's hfill). If a number is specified, pad to the
              percentage of the window's width.  A '0' qualifier tells screen to treat the  number  as  absolute
              position.   You  can  specify  to  pad  relative to the last absolute pad position by adding a '+'
              qualifier or to pad relative to the right margin by using '-'. The padding truncates the string if
              the specified position lies before the current position. Add the 'L' qualifier to change this.

       &lt;      same as '%=' but just do truncation, do not fill with spaces

       &gt;      mark the current text position for the next truncation. When screen needs  to  do  truncation,  it
              tries  to  do  it  in a way that the marked position gets moved to the specified percentage of the
              output area. (The area starts from the last absolute pad  position  and  ends  with  the  position
              specified  by the truncation operator.) The 'L' qualifier tells screen to mark the truncated parts
              with '...'.

       {      attribute/color modifier string terminated by the next }

       `      Substitute with the output of a 'backtick' command. The length qualifier is  misused  to  identify
              one of the commands.

       The  'c'  and  'C'  escape  may  be qualified with a '0' to make <u>screen</u> use zero instead of space as fill
       character. The '0' qualifier also makes the '=' escape use absolute positions. The 'n'  and  '='  escapes
       understand  a length qualifier (e.g. '%3n'), 'D' and 'M' can be prefixed with 'L' to generate long names,
       'w' and 'W' also show the window flags if 'L' is given.

       An attribute/color modifier is used to change the  attributes  or  the  color  settings.  Its  format  is
       [attribute  modifier]  [color  description].  The  attribute  modifier  must be prefixed by a change type
       indicator if it can be confused with a color description. The following change types are known:

       +      add the specified set to the current attributes

       -      remove the set from the current attributes

       !      invert the set in the current attributes

       =      change the current attributes to the specified set

       The attribute set can either be specified as a hexadecimal number  or  a  combination  of  the  following
       letters:

       d      dim
       u      underline
       b      bold
       r      reverse
       s      /standout
       B      blinking

       Colors  are  coded  either  as  a hexadecimal number or two letters specifying the desired background and
       foreground color (in that order). The following colors are known:

       k      black
       r      red
       g      green
       y      yellow
       b      blue
       m      magenta
       c      cyan
       w      white
       d      default color
       .      leave color unchanged

       The capitalized versions of the letter specify bright colors. You can also use the  pseudo-color  'i'  to
       set just the brightness and leave the color unchanged.
       A  one  digit/letter  color  description  is  treated  as foreground or background color dependent on the
       current attributes: if reverse mode is set, the background color is changed  instead  of  the  foreground
       color.   If  you don't like this, prefix the color with a .. If you want the same behavior for two-letter
       color descriptions, also prefix them with a ..
       As a special case, %{-} restores the attributes and colors that were set before the last change was  made
       (i.e., pops one level of the color-change stack).

       Examples:

       G      set color to bright green

       +b r   use bold red

       = yd   clear all attributes, write in default color on yellow background.

       %-Lw%{= BW}%50&gt;%n%f* %t%{-}%+Lw%&lt;
              The  available  windows  centered  at the current window and truncated to the available width. The
              current window is displayed white on blue.  This can be used with hardstatus alwayslastline.

       %?%F%{.R.}%?%3n %t%? [%h]%?
              The window number and title and the window's hardstatus, if one is set.  Also use a red background
              if this is the active focus. Useful for caption string.

</pre><h4><b>FLOW-CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       Each window has a flow-control setting that determines how <u>screen</u> deals with the XON and XOFF  characters
       (and  perhaps the interrupt character).  When flow-control is turned off, <u>screen</u> ignores the XON and XOFF
       characters, which allows the user to send them to the current program by simply typing them  (useful  for
       the  <u>emacs</u>  editor,  for  instance).   The trade-off is that it will take longer for output from a normal
       program to pause in response to an XOFF.  With flow-control turned on, XON and XOFF characters  are  used
       to  immediately  pause  the  output  of  the  current window.  You can still send these characters to the
       current program, but you must use the appropriate two-character <u>screen</u> commands (typically  C-a  q  (xon)
       and  C-a  s  (xoff)).   The xon/xoff commands are also useful for typing C-s and C-q past a terminal that
       intercepts these characters.

       Each window has an initial flow-control value set with either the <b>-f</b>  option  or  the  defflow  .screenrc
       command. Per default the windows are set to automatic flow-switching.  It can then be toggled between the
       three  states  'fixed  on', 'fixed off' and 'automatic' interactively with the flow command bound to "C-a
       f".

       The automatic flow-switching mode deals with flow control using the TIOCPKT mode (like rlogin  does).  If
       the  tty  driver  does  not support TIOCPKT, <u>screen</u> tries to find out the right mode based on the current
       setting of the application keypad - when it is enabled, flow-control is turned off and  visa  versa.   Of
       course, you can still manipulate flow-control manually when needed.

       If  you're  running with flow-control enabled and find that pressing the interrupt key (usually C-c) does
       not interrupt the display until another 6-8 lines have scrolled by, try running <u>screen</u> with the interrupt
       option (add the interrupt flag to the flow command in your .screenrc, or use the <b>-i</b> command-line option).
       This causes the output that <u>screen</u> has accumulated from the  interrupted  program  to  be  flushed.   One
       disadvantage  is that the virtual terminal's memory contains the non-flushed version of the output, which
       in rare cases can cause minor inaccuracies in the output.  For example, if you switch screens and return,
       or update the screen with C-a l you would see the version of the output you  would  have  gotten  without
       interrupt  being on.  Also, you might need to turn off flow-control (or use auto-flow mode to turn it off
       automatically) when running a program that expects you to type the interrupt character as input, as it is
       possible to interrupt the output of the virtual terminal to your physical terminal when  flow-control  is
       enabled.   If  this happens, a simple refresh of the screen with C-a l will restore it.  Give each mode a
       try, and use whichever mode you find more comfortable.

</pre><h4><b>TITLES</b> <b>(naming</b> <b>windows)</b></h4><pre>
       You can customize each window's name in the window display (viewed with the windows command (C-a  w))  by
       setting it with one of the title commands.  Normally the name displayed is the actual command name of the
       program  created  in  the window.  However, it is sometimes useful to distinguish various programs of the
       same name or to change the name on-the-fly to reflect the current state of the window.

       The default name for all shell windows can be set with the shelltitle  command  in  the  .screenrc  file,
       while  all  other  windows are created with a screen command and thus can have their name set with the <b>-t</b>
       option.  Interactively, there is  the  title-string  escape-sequence  (&lt;esc&gt;k<u>name</u>&lt;esc&gt;\)  and  the  title
       command  (C-a  A).   The  former  can  be  output  from an application to control the window's name under
       software control, and the latter will prompt for a name when typed.  You can also bind pre-defined  names
       to  keys  with  the  title command to set things quickly without prompting. Changing title by this escape
       sequence can be controlled by <b>defdynamictitle</b> and <b>dynamictitle</b> commands.

       Finally, <u>screen</u> has a  shell-specific  heuristic  that  is  enabled  by  setting  the  window's  name  to
       <u>search|name</u>  and  arranging  to  have  a null title escape-sequence output as a part of your prompt.  The
       <u>search</u> portion specifies an end-of-prompt search string, while the <u>name</u>  portion  specifies  the  default
       shell  name for the window.  If the <u>name</u> ends in a `:' <u>screen</u> will add what it believes to be the current
       command running in the window to the end of the window's  shell  name  (e.g.  <u>name:cmd</u>).   Otherwise  the
       current command name supersedes the shell name while it is running.

       Here's  how  it  works:   you  must  modify  your  shell  prompt  to  output a null title-escape-sequence
       (&lt;esc&gt;k&lt;esc&gt;\) as a part of your prompt.  The last part of your prompt must be the same as the string you
       specified for the <u>search</u> portion of the title.  Once this is set up, <u>screen</u> will  use  the  title-escape-
       sequence  to clear the previous command name and get ready for the next command.  Then, when a newline is
       received from the shell, a search is made for the end of the prompt.  If found, it will  grab  the  first
       word  after  the  matched  string and use it as the command name.  If the command name begins with either
       '!', '%', or '^' <u>screen</u> will use the first word on the following line (if found)  in  preference  to  the
       just-found  name.  This helps csh users get better command names when using job control or history recall
       commands.

       Here's some .screenrc examples:

                   screen -t top 2 nice top

       Adding this line to your .screenrc would start a nice-d version of the top command in window 2 named  top
       rather than nice.

                   shelltitle '&gt; |csh'
                   screen 1

       These  commands would start a shell with the given shelltitle.  The title specified is an auto-title that
       would expect the prompt and the typed command to look something like the following:

                   /usr/joe/src/dir&gt; trn

       (it looks after the '&gt; ' for the command name).  The window status would show  the  name  trn  while  the
       command was running, and revert to csh upon completion.

                   bind R screen -t '% |root:' su

       Having  this command in your .screenrc would bind the key sequence C-a R to the su command and give it an
       auto-title name of root:.  For this auto-title to work, the screen could look something like this:

                   % !em
                   emacs file.c

       Here the user typed the csh history command !em which ran the  previously  entered  emacs  command.   The
       window  status  would  show root:emacs during the execution of the command, and revert to simply root: at
       its completion.

                   bind o title
                   bind E title ""
                   bind u title (unknown)

       The first binding doesn't have any arguments, so it would prompt you for a title when  you  type  C-a  o.
       The  second binding would clear an auto-title's current setting (C-a E).  The third binding would set the
       current window's title to (unknown) (C-a u).

       One thing to keep in mind when adding a null title-escape-sequence to your prompt  is  that  some  shells
       (like  the  csh) count all the non-control characters as part of the prompt's length.  If these invisible
       characters aren't a multiple of 8 then backspacing over a tab will result in an incorrect  display.   One
       way to get around this is to use a prompt like this:

                   set prompt='^[[0000m^[k^[\% '

       The escape-sequence &lt;esc&gt;[0000m not only normalizes the character attributes, but all the zeros round the
       length of the invisible characters up to 8.  Bash users will probably want to echo the escape sequence in
       the PROMPT_COMMAND:

                   PROMPT_COMMAND='printf "\033k\033\134"'

       (I used \134 to output a `\' because of a bug in bash v1.04).

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>VIRTUAL</b> <b>TERMINAL</b></h4><pre>
       Each  window  in  a  <u>screen</u> session emulates a VT100 terminal, with some extra functions added. The VT100
       emulator is hard-coded, no other terminal types can be emulated.
       Usually <u>screen</u> tries to emulate as much of the VT100/ANSI standard as  possible.  But  if  your  terminal
       lacks  certain  capabilities,  the  emulation  may not be complete. In these cases <u>screen</u> has to tell the
       applications that some of the features are missing. This is no problem on machines using termcap, because
       <u>screen</u> can use the $TERMCAP variable to customize the standard <u>screen</u> termcap.

       But if you do a rlogin on another machine or your machine  supports  only  terminfo  this  method  fails.
       Because of this, <u>screen</u> offers a way to deal with these cases.  Here is how it works:

       When  <u>screen</u>  tries  to  figure  out  a  terminal  name  for  itself,  it  first looks for an entry named
       screen.&lt;term&gt;, where &lt;term&gt; is the contents of your $TERM variable.  If  no  such  entry  exists,  <u>screen</u>
       tries  screen  (or  screen-w  if  the terminal is wide (132 cols or more)).  If even this entry cannot be
       found, vt100 is used as a substitute.

       The idea is that if you have a terminal which doesn't support an important feature (e.g. delete  char  or
       clear  to  EOS)  you can build a new termcap/terminfo entry for <u>screen</u> (named screen.&lt;dumbterm&gt;) in which
       this capability has been disabled. If this entry is installed on your machines  you  are  able  to  do  a
       rlogin and still keep the correct termcap/terminfo entry.  The terminal name is put in the $TERM variable
       of  all  new  windows.  <u>Screen</u> also sets the $TERMCAP variable reflecting the capabilities of the virtual
       terminal emulated. Notice that, however, on machines using the terminfo database  this  variable  has  no
       effect.  Furthermore, the variable $WINDOW is set to the window number of each window.

       The actual set of capabilities supported by the virtual terminal depends on the capabilities supported by
       the  physical terminal.  If, for instance, the physical terminal does not support underscore mode, <u>screen</u>
       does not put the `us' and `ue' capabilities into the window's $TERMCAP variable, accordingly.  However, a
       minimum number of capabilities must be supported by a terminal in order to run <u>screen</u>; namely  scrolling,
       clear  screen, and direct cursor addressing (in addition, <u>screen</u> does not run on hardcopy terminals or on
       terminals that over-strike).

       Also, you can customize the $TERMCAP value used by <u>screen</u> by using the termcap .screenrc command,  or  by
       defining  the variable $SCREENCAP prior to startup.  When the latter is defined, its value will be copied
       verbatim into each window's $TERMCAP variable.  This can either be the full  terminal  definition,  or  a
       filename where the terminal screen (and/or screen-w) is defined.

       Note  that  <u>screen</u>  honors the terminfo .screenrc command if the system uses the terminfo database rather
       than termcap.

       When the boolean `G0' capability is present in the termcap entry for the terminal  on  which  <u>screen</u>  has
       been  called,  the  terminal  emulation  of  <u>screen</u>  supports  multiple  character  sets.  This allows an
       application to make use of, for instance, the VT100 graphics character set or  national  character  sets.
       The following control functions from ISO 2022 are supported: <u>lock</u> <u>shift</u> <u>G0</u> (<u>SI</u>), <u>lock</u> <u>shift</u> <u>G1</u> (<u>SO</u>), <u>lock</u>
       <u>shift</u>  <u>G2</u>,  <u>lock</u>  <u>shift</u>  <u>G3</u>, <u>single</u> <u>shift</u> <u>G2</u>, and <u>single</u> <u>shift</u> <u>G3</u>.  When a virtual terminal is created or
       reset, the ASCII character set is designated as <u>G0</u> through <u>G3</u>.  When  the  `G0'  capability  is  present,
       <u>screen</u> evaluates the capabilities `S0', `E0', and `C0' if present. `S0' is the sequence the terminal uses
       to enable and start the graphics character set rather than <u>SI</u>.  `E0' is the corresponding replacement for
       <u>SO</u>.  `C0'  gives a character by character translation string that is used during semi-graphics mode. This
       string is built like the `acsc' terminfo capability.

       When the `po' and `pf' capabilities are present in the terminal's termcap entry, applications running  in
       a  <u>screen</u>  window  can  send  output  to the printer port of the terminal.  This allows a user to have an
       application in one window sending output to a printer connected to the terminal, while all other  windows
       are  still  active (the printer port is enabled and disabled again for each chunk of output).  As a side-
       effect, programs running in different windows can send output to the printer simultaneously.   Data  sent
       to  the  printer  is not displayed in the window.  The <u>info</u> command displays a line starting `PRIN' while
       the printer is active.

       <u>Screen</u> maintains a hardstatus line for every window. If a window gets selected, the display's  hardstatus
       will  be updated to match the window's hardstatus line. If the display has no hardstatus the line will be
       displayed as a standard <u>screen</u> message.  The hardstatus line can be changed  with  the  ANSI  Application
       Program   Command   (APC):   ESC_&lt;string&gt;ESC\.   As   a   convenience   for   xterm  users  the  sequence
       ESC]0..2;&lt;string&gt;^G is also accepted.

       Some capabilities are only put into the $TERMCAP  variable  of  the  virtual  terminal  if  they  can  be
       efficiently  implemented by the physical terminal.  For instance, `dl' (delete line) is only put into the
       $TERMCAP variable if the terminal supports either delete line itself or scrolling regions. Note that this
       may provoke confusion, when the session is reattached on a different terminal, as the value  of  $TERMCAP
       cannot be modified by parent processes.

       The  "alternate  screen"  capability  is  not enabled by default.  Set the <b>altscreen</b> .screenrc command to
       enable it.

       The following is a list of control sequences recognized by <u>screen</u>.  (V) and (A)  indicate  VT100-specific
       and ANSI- or ISO-specific functions, respectively.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>TRANSLATION</b></h4><pre>
       In order to do a full VT100 emulation <u>screen</u> has to detect that a sequence of  characters  in  the  input
       stream  was  generated  by  a keypress on the user's keyboard and insert the VT100 style escape sequence.
       <u>Screen</u> has a very flexible way of doing this by making it possible to map arbitrary commands on arbitrary
       sequences of characters. For standard VT100 emulation the command will always  insert  a  string  in  the
       input  buffer  of  the  window  (see  also  command  <b>stuff</b>  in the command table).  Because the sequences
       generated by a keypress can change after a reattach from a different terminal type,  it  is  possible  to
       bind  commands  to  the  termcap  name  of  the  keys.  <u>Screen</u> will insert the correct binding after each
       reattach. See the <b>bindkey</b> command for further details on the syntax and examples.

       Here is the table of the default key bindings. The fourth is what command is executed if the keyboard  is
       switched into application mode.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>TERMINAL</b> <b>CAPABILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following table describes all terminal capabilities that are recognized by <u>screen</u> and are not in the
       <a href="../man5/termcap.5.html">termcap</a>(5) manual.  You can place these capabilities in your termcap entries (in `/etc/termcap')  or  use
       them  with  the  commands `termcap', `terminfo' and `termcapinfo' in your screenrc files. It is often not
       possible to place these capabilities in the terminfo database.

       <b>LP</b>   <u>(bool)</u>  Terminal has VT100 style margins (`magic margins'). Note that this  capability  is  obsolete
                    because <u>screen</u> uses the standard 'xn' instead.

       <b>Z0</b>   <u>(str)</u>   Change width to 132 columns.

       <b>Z1</b>   <u>(str)</u>   Change width to 80 columns.

       <b>WS</b>   <u>(str)</u>   Resize  display.  This capability has the desired width and height as arguments. <u>SunView(tm)</u>
                    example: '\E[8;%d;%dt'.

       <b>NF</b>   <u>(bool)</u>  Terminal doesn't need flow control. Send ^S and ^Q direct to the application. Same as  'flow
                    off'. The opposite of this capability is 'nx'.

       <b>G0</b>   <u>(bool)</u>  Terminal can deal with ISO 2022 font selection sequences.

       <b>S0</b>   <u>(str)</u>   Switch charset 'G0' to the specified charset. Default is '\E(%.'.

       <b>E0</b>   <u>(str)</u>   Switch charset 'G0' back to standard charset. Default is '\E(B'.

       <b>C0</b>   <u>(str)</u>   Use the string as a conversion table for font '0'. See the 'ac' capability for more details.

       <b>CS</b>   <u>(str)</u>   Switch cursor-keys to application mode.

       <b>CE</b>   <u>(str)</u>   Switch cursor-keys back to normal mode.

       <b>AN</b>   <u>(bool)</u>  Turn on autonuke. See the 'autonuke' command for more details.

       <b>OL</b>   <u>(num)</u>   Set the output buffer limit. See the 'obuflimit' command for more details.

       <b>KJ</b>   <u>(str)</u>   Set the encoding of the terminal. See the 'encoding' command for valid encodings.

       <b>AF</b>   <u>(str)</u>   Change character foreground color in an ANSI conform way. This capability will almost always
                    be set to '\E[3%dm' ('\E[3%p1%dm' on terminfo machines).

       <b>AB</b>   <u>(str)</u>   Same as 'AF', but change background color.

       <b>AX</b>   <u>(bool)</u>  Does understand ANSI set default fg/bg color (\E[39m / \E[49m).

       <b>XC</b>   <u>(str)</u>   Describe  a translation of characters to strings depending on the current font. More details
                    follow in the next section.

       <b>XT</b>   <u>(bool)</u>  Terminal understands special xterm sequences (OSC, mouse tracking).

       <b>C8</b>   <u>(bool)</u>  Terminal needs bold to display high-intensity colors (e.g. Eterm).

       <b>TF</b>   <u>(bool)</u>  Add missing capabilities to the termcap/info entry. (Set by default).

</pre><h4><b>CHARACTER</b> <b>TRANSLATION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Screen</u> has a powerful mechanism to translate characters to arbitrary strings  depending  on  the  current
       font  and  terminal type.  Use this feature if you want to work with a common standard character set (say
       ISO8851-latin1) even on terminals that scatter the more unusual characters over several national language
       font pages.

       Syntax:
           <b>XC=</b><u>&lt;charset-mapping&gt;</u>{<b>,,</b><u>&lt;charset-mapping&gt;</u>}
           <u>&lt;charset-mapping&gt;</u> := <u>&lt;designator&gt;&lt;template&gt;</u>{<b>,</b><u>&lt;mapping&gt;</u>}
           <u>&lt;mapping&gt;</u> := <u>&lt;char-to-be-mapped&gt;&lt;template-arg&gt;</u>

       The things in braces may be repeated any number of times.

       A <u>&lt;charset-mapping&gt;</u> tells <u>screen</u> how to map characters in font <u>&lt;designator&gt;</u> ('B': Ascii,  'A':  UK,  'K':
       German,  etc.)   to  strings.  Every  <u>&lt;mapping&gt;</u>  describes  to  what  string  a  single character will be
       translated. A template mechanism is used, as most of the time the codes have a lot in common (for example
       strings to switch to and from another charset). Each occurrence of '%'  in  <u>&lt;template&gt;</u>  gets  substituted
       with  the  <u>&lt;template-arg&gt;</u>  specified together with the character. If your strings are not similar at all,
       then use '%' as a template and place the full string in <u>&lt;template-arg&gt;</u>. A quoting mechanism was added  to
       make it possible to use a real '%'. The '\' character quotes the special characters '\', '%', and ','.

       Here is an example:

           termcap hp700 'XC=B\E(K%\E(B,\304[,\326\\\\,\334]'

       This  tells  <u>screen</u>  how  to  translate  ISOlatin1  (charset 'B') upper case umlaut characters on a hp700
       terminal that has a German charset. '\304' gets translated to '\E(K[\E(B' and so on.  Note that this line
       gets parsed *three* times before the internal lookup table is built, therefore a lot of quoting is needed
       to create a single '\'.

       Another extension was added to allow more emulation: If a mapping translates the unquoted  '%'  char,  it
       will  be sent to the terminal whenever <u>screen</u> switches to the corresponding <u>&lt;designator&gt;</u>. In this special
       case the template is assumed to be just '%'  because  the  charset  switch  sequence  and  the  character
       mappings normally haven't much in common.

       This example shows one use of the extension:

           termcap xterm 'XC=K%,%\E(B,[\304,\\\\\326,]\334'

       Here,  a  part  of  the German ('K') charset is emulated on an xterm.  If <u>screen</u> has to change to the 'K'
       charset, '\E(B' will be sent to the terminal, i.e. the ASCII charset is used  instead.  The  template  is
       just '%', so the mapping is straightforward: '[' to '\304', '\' to '\326', and ']' to '\334'.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       •  `dm'  (delete mode) and `xs' are not handled correctly (they are ignored). `xn' is treated as a magic-
          margin indicator.

       •  <u>Screen</u> has no clue about double-high or double-wide characters.  But  this  is  the  only  area  where
          <u>vttest</u> is allowed to fail.

       •  It  is  not  possible  to  change the environment variable $TERMCAP when reattaching under a different
          terminal type.

       •  The support of terminfo based systems is very limited. Adding extra capabilities to $TERMCAP  may  not
          have any effects.

       •  <u>Screen</u> does not make use of hardware tabs.

       •  <u>Screen</u>  must  be installed as set-uid with owner root on most systems in order to be able to correctly
          change the owner of the tty device file for each window.  Special permission may also be  required  to
          write the file /run/utmp.

       •  Entries  in  <a href="file:/run/utmp">/run/utmp</a>  are  not  removed  when  <u>screen</u>  is killed with SIGKILL.  This will cause some
          programs (like "w" or "rwho") to advertise that a user is logged on who really isn't.

       •  <u>Screen</u> may give a strange warning when your tty has no utmp entry.

       •  When the modem line was hung up, <u>screen</u> may not automatically  detach  (or  quit)  unless  the  device
          driver  is  configured  to  send a HANGUP signal.  To detach a <u>screen</u> session use the -D or -d command
          line option.

       •  If a password is set, the command line options -d and -D still detach a session without asking.

       •  Both breaktype and defbreaktype change the break generating method used by all terminal  devices.  The
          first should change a window specific setting, where the latter should change only the default for new
          windows.

       •  When  attaching to a multiuser session, the user's .screenrc file is not sourced. Each user's personal
          settings have to be included in the .screenrc file from which the session is booted,  or  have  to  be
          changed manually.

       •  A weird imagination is most useful to gain full advantage of all the features.
