</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XSecureLock - X11 screen lock utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNPOSIS</b></h4><pre>
       [<u>options</u>] xsecurelock [– <u>command-to-run-when-locked</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       XSecureLock is an X11 screen lock utility designed with the primary goal of security.

       It  locks  the  current X11 session, and only allows unlocking if the user authenticates to it (typically
       with the login password).

       While locked, it can launch a screen saver process and then waits for input events.  Upon an input event,
       it displays a login dialog to allow for unlocking.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options are set as environment variables prior to  invoking  XSecureLock;  the  following  variables  are
       available:

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_AUTH</b>:  specifies  the desired authentication module (the part that displays the authentica‐
         tion prompt).

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_AUTHPROTO</b>: specifies the desired authentication protocol module (the part that talks to the
         system).

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_AUTH_BACKGROUND_COLOR</b>: specifies the X11 color (see manpage of XParseColor) for  the  back‐
         ground of the auth dialog.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_AUTH_CURSOR_BLINK</b>:  if  set, the cursor will blink in the auth dialog.  Enabled by default,
         can be set to 0 to disable.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_AUTH_SOUNDS</b>: specifies whether to play sounds during  authentication  to  indicate  status.
         Sounds are defined as follows:

         • High-pitch ascending: prompt for user input.

         • High-pitch constant: an info message was displayed.

         • Low-pitch descending: an error message was displayed.

         • Medium-pitch ascending: authentication successful.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_AUTH_FOREGROUND_COLOR</b>:  specifies  the X11 color (see manpage of XParseColor) for the fore‐
         ground text of the auth dialog.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_AUTH_TIMEOUT</b>: specifies the time (in seconds) to wait for response to a prompt by  <b>auth_x11</b>
         before giving up and reverting to the screen saver.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_AUTH_WARNING_COLOR</b>:  specifies  the  X11 color (see manpage of XParseColor) for the warning
         text of the auth dialog.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_BACKGROUND_COLOR</b>: specifies the X11 color (see manpage of XParseColor) for  the  background
         of the main and saver windows.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_BLANK_TIMEOUT</b>:  specifies  the  time  (in  seconds)  before  telling X11 to fully blank the
         screen; a negative value disables X11 blanking.  The time is measured since the  closing  of  the  auth
         window  or  xsecurelock  startup.   Setting  this  to  0  is  rather nonsensical, as key-release events
         (e.g. from the keystroke to launch xsecurelock or from pressing escape to close the auth dialog) always
         wake up the screen.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_BLANK_DPMS_STATE</b>: specifies which DPMS state to put the screen in  when  blanking  (one  of
         standby, suspend, off and on, where “on” means to not invoke DPMS at all).

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_BURNIN_MITIGATION</b>:  specifies  the  number of pixels the prompt of <b>auth_x11</b> may be moved at
         startup to mitigate possible burn-in effects due to the  auth  dialog  being  displayed  all  the  time
         (e.g. when spurious mouse events wake up the screen all the time).

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_BURNIN_MITIGATION_DYNAMIC</b>:  if set to a non-zero value, <b>auth_x11</b> will move the prompt while
         it is being displayed, but stay within the bounds of <b>XSECURELOCK_BURNIN_MITIGATION</b>.  The value of  this
         variable  is  the  maximum allowed shift per screen refresh.  This mitigates short-term burn-in effects
         but is probably annoying to most users, and thus disabled by default.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_COMPOSITE_OBSCURER</b>: create a second full-screen window to obscure window content in case  a
         running  compositor  unmaps its own window.  Helps with some instances of bad compositor behavior (such
         as compositor crashes/restarts, but also compton has been caught at drawing  notification  icons  above
         the  screen  locker  when  not using the GLX backend), should prevent compositors from unredirecting as
         it’s 1 pixel smaller than the screen from every side, and should otherwise be harmless, so it’s enabled
         by default.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_DATETIME_FORMAT</b>: the date format to show.  Defaults to the locale settings.  (see <b>man</b>  <b>date</b>
         for possible formats)

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_DEBUG_ALLOW_LOCKING_IF_INEFFECTIVE</b>: Normally we don’t allow locking sessions that are like‐
         ly  not  any useful to lock, such as the X11 part of a Wayland session (one could still use Wayland ap‐
         plicatione when locked) or VNC sessions (as it’d only lock the server side  session  while  users  will
         likely  think  they  locked  the client, allowing for an easy escape).  These checks can be bypassed by
         setting this variable to 1.  Not recommended other than for debugging XSecureLock itself via such  con‐
         nections.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_DEBUG_WINDOW_INFO</b>:  When  complaining  about another window misbehaving, print not just the
         window ID but also some info about it.  Uses the <b>xwininfo</b> and <b>xprop</b> tools.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_DIM_ALPHA</b>: Linear-space opacity to fade the screen to.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_DIM_COLOR</b>: X11 color to fade the screen to.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_DIM_FPS</b>: Target framerate to attain during the dimming effect of <b>dimmer</b>.   Ideally  matches
         the display refresh rate.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_DIM_MAX_FILL_SIZE</b>:  Maximum size (in width or height) to fill at once using an XFillRectan‐
         gle call.  Low values may cause performance loss or noticeable tearing during dimming; high values  may
         cause crashes or hangs with some graphics drivers or a temporarily unresponsive X server.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_DIM_OVERRIDE_COMPOSITOR_DETECTION</b>:  When  set to 1, always try to use transparency for dim‐
         ming; when set to 0, always use a dither pattern.  Default is to autodetect whether  transparency  will
         likely work.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_DIM_TIME_MS</b>:  Milliseconds to dim for when above xss-lock command line with <b>dimmer</b> is used;
         also used by <b>wait_nonidle</b> to know when to assume dimming and waiting has finished and exit.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_DISCARD_FIRST_KEYPRESS</b>: If set to 0, the key pressed to stop the screen saver and spawn the
         auth child is sent to the auth child (and thus becomes part of the password entry).  By default we  al‐
         ways  discard the key press that started the authentication flow, to prevent users from getting used to
         type their password on a blank screen (which could be just powered off and have a chat client behind or
         similar).

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_FONT</b>: X11 or FontConfig font name to use for <b>auth_x11</b>.  You can get  a  list  of  supported
         font names by running <b>xlsfonts</b> and <b>fc-list</b>.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_FORCE_GRAB</b>:  When  grabbing  fails,  try stealing the grab from other windows (a value of <b>2</b>
         steals from all descendants of the root window, while a value of <b>1</b> only steals  from  client  windows).
         This  works  only  sometimes  and is incompatible with many window managers, so use with care.  See the
         “Forcing Grabs” section below for details.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_GLOBAL_SAVER</b>: specifies the desired global screen saver module (by default this is a multi‐
         plexer that runs <b>XSECURELOCK_SAVER</b> on each screen).

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_IDLE_TIMERS</b>: comma-separated list of idle time counters  used  by  <b>until_nonidle</b>.   Typical
         values  are  either empty (relies on the X Screen Saver extension instead), “IDLETIME” and “DEVICEIDLE‐
         TIME ” where n is an XInput device index (run <b>xinput</b> to see them).  If multiple time counters are spec‐
         ified, the idle time is the minimum of them all.  All listed timers must have the same unit.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_IMAGE_DURATION_SECONDS</b>: how long to show each still image played by <b>saver_mpv</b>.  Defaults to
         1.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_KEY_%s_COMMAND</b> where <b>%s</b> is the name of an X11 keysym (find using <b>xev</b>): a shell  command  to
         execute  when the specified key is pressed.  Useful e.g. for media player control.  Beware: be cautious
         about what you run with this, as it may yield attackers control over your computer.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_LIST_VIDEOS_COMMAND</b>: shell command to list all video files to potentially play by <b>saver_mpv</b>
         or <b>saver_mplayer</b>.  Defaults to <b>find</b> <b><a href="file:~/Videos">~/Videos</a></b> <b>-type</b> <b>f</b>.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_NO_COMPOSITE</b>: disables covering the composite overlay window.  This switches to a more tra‐
         ditional way of locking, but may allow desktop notifications to be visible on top of the  screen  lock.
         Not recommended.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_NO_PAM_RHOST</b>:  do not set <b>PAM_RHOST</b> to <b>localhost</b>, despite recommendation (<a href="http://www.linux">http://www.linux</a>-
         pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/adg-security-user-identity.html) to do so by the Linux-PAM Application  Develop‐
         ers’  Guide.   This  may  work around bugs in third-party PAM authentication modules.  If this solves a
         problem for you, please report a bug against said PAM module.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_NO_XRANDR</b>: disables multi monitor support using XRandR.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_NO_XRANDR15</b>: disables multi monitor support using XRandR 1.5 and fall back to  XRandR  1.2.
         Not recommended.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_PAM_SERVICE</b>: pam service name.  You should have a file with that name in <b><a href="file:/etc/pam.d">/etc/pam.d</a></b>.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_PASSWORD_PROMPT</b>: Choose password prompt mode:

         • <b>asterisks</b>:  shows  asterisks, like classic password prompts.  This is the least secure option because
           password length is visible.

                  ***_
                  *******_

         • <b>cursor</b>: shows a cursor that jumps around on each key press.  This is the default.

                  ________|_______________________
                  ___________________|____________

         • <b>disco</b>: shows dancers, which dance around on each key press.  Requires a font that can handle  Unicode
           line drawing characters, and FontConfig.

                  ┏(･o･)┛ ♪ ┗(･o･)┓ ♪ ┏(･o･)┛ ♪ ┗(･o･)┓ ♪ ┏(･o･)┛
                  ┗(･o･)┓ ♪ ┏(･o･)┛ ♪ ┏(･o･)┛ ♪ ┏(･o･)┛ ♪ ┏(･o･)┛

         • <b>emoji</b>:  shows an emoji, changing which one on each key press.  Requires a font that can handle emoji,
           and FontConfig.

                  👍
                  🎶
                  💕

         • <b>emoticon</b>: shows an ascii emoticon, changing which one on each key press.

                  :-O
                  d-X
                  X-\

         • <b>hidden</b>: completely hides the password, and there’s no feedback for keypresses.  This would almost  be
           most  secure - however as it gives no feedback to input whatsoever, you may not be able to notice ac‐
           cidentally typing to another computer and sending your password to some chatroom.

         • <b>kaomoji</b>: shows a kaomoji (Japanese emoticon), changing which one  on  each  key  press.   Requires  a
           Japanese font, and FontConfig.

                  (͡°͜ʖ͡°)
                  (＾ｕ＾)
                  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

         • <b>time</b>: shows the current time since the epoch on each keystroke.  This may be the most secure mode, as
           it  gives  feedback to keystroke based exclusively on public information, and does not carry over any
           state between keystrokes whatsoever - not even some form of randomness.

                  1559655410.922329

         • <b>time_hex</b>: same as <b>time</b>, but in microseconds and hexadecimal.  “Because we can”.

                  0x58a7f92bd7359

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_SAVER</b>: specifies the desired screen saver module.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_SAVER_RESET_ON_AUTH_CLOSE</b>: specifies whether to reset the saver module when the auth dialog
         closes.  Resetting is done by sending <b>SIGUSR1</b> to the saver, which may either just terminate, or  handle
         this specifically to do a cheaper reset.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_SHOW_DATETIME</b>: whether to show local date and time on the login.  Disabled by default.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_SHOW_HOSTNAME</b>: whether to show the hostname on the login screen of <b>auth_x11</b>.  Possible val‐
         ues are 0 for not showing the hostname, 1 for showing the short form, and 2 for showing the long form.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_SHOW_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT</b>:  whether to show the name of the current keyboard layout.  Enabled by
         default.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_SHOW_USERNAME</b>: whether to show the username on the login screen of <b>auth_x11</b>.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_SINGLE_AUTH_WINDOW</b>: whether to show only a single auth window from <b>auth_x11</b>, as opposed  to
         one per screen.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_SWITCH_USER_COMMAND</b>:  shell  command to execute when <b>Win-O</b> or <b>Ctrl-Alt-O</b> are pressed (think
         “<u>other</u> user”).  Typical values could be <b>lxdm</b> <b>-c</b> <b>USER_SWITCH</b>, <b>dm-tool</b> <b>switch-to-greeter</b>,  <b>gdmflexiserver</b>
         or <b>kdmctl</b> <b>reserve</b>, depending on your desktop environment.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_VIDEOS_FLAGS</b>:  flags  to  append when invoking mpv/mplayer with <b>saver_mpv</b> or <b>saver_mplayer</b>.
         Defaults to empty.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_WAIT_TIME_MS</b>: Milliseconds to wait after dimming (and before locking) when  above  xss-lock
         command line is used.  Should be at least as large as the period time set using “xset s”.  Also used by
         <b>wait_nonidle</b> to know when to assume dimming and waiting has finished and exit.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_SAVER_DELAY_MS</b>:  Milliseconds  to  wait  after starting children process and before mapping
         windows to let children be ready to display and reduce the black flash.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_SAVER_STOP_ON_BLANK</b>: specifies if saver is stopped when screen is blanked (DPMS or XSS)  to
         save power.

       • <b>XSECURELOCK_XSCREENSAVER_PATH</b>:   Location   where   XScreenSaver   hacks   are  installed  for  use  by
         <b>saver_xscreensaver</b>.

       Additionally, XSecureLock spawns the <u>command-to-run-when-locked</u> once locking is  complete;  this  can  be
       used as a notification mechanism if desired.
