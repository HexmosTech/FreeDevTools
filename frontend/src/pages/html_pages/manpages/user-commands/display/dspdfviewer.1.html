</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dspdfviewer - Dual-Screen PDF Viewer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dspdfviewer</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>[filename]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dspdfviewer</b>  is  intended  for  presentations created with the <b>latex-beamer</b> class, specifically documents
       created with the show notes on second screen=right option.

       Its purpose is to display the left half of a page on the audience's screen (which will most commonly be a
       projector) and the right half  on  your  "private"  screen  (think:  the  notebook  you  carried  to  the
       presentation  site).   The basic idea is that you will display personal notes and information to help you
       with your presentation on your personal screen, while the audience sees only the PDF they are supposed to
       see.

       On the secondary screen you will see three clocks: A "wall clock", a "presentation" clock and  a  "slide"
       clock.

       The  wall  clock  in  the  bottom  left  corner  that display current time of day, the presentation clock
       (labeled "Total") counts the time you spent since you started the presentation, and the  "slide"  counter
       (bottom right) displays the time you spent on the current slide.

       The  clocks  don't  start  the second you launch the program, the idea behind that behaviour is that many
       people have a "title" slide active long before the audience even arrives.

       Once you use the next/previous slide commands, the clock starts. If you want  to  start  the  clock,  but
       still display the title slide, just press "previous" (for example, Up Arrow or Right Mouse Button) on the
       title slide.

       If you want to reset the clocks to zero, press the "Home" button on the keybord.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The exact behaviour of <b>dspdfviewer</b> is configurable using command-line parameters.

       Unless  otherwise  noted,  all command-line options can be written in a configuration file. See the <u>FILES</u>
       section for the location.

       For the command-line parameters, this program follows the  usual  GNU  command  line  syntax,  with  long
       options starting with two dashes ('-').  A summary of options is included below.

       If you specify those in a configuration file, write one option per line, use the <u>long</u> <u>version</u> <u>without</u> <u>the</u>
       <u>two</u> <u>leading</u> <u>dashes</u>, followed by an equals sign and the desired value.

       For example, <b>bottom-pane-height=20</b> is a valid configuration line.

       If  an  option  is  specified in <b>both</b> the configuration file and the command-line, the command-line value
       takes precedence.

       Note for options of type <u>&lt;bool&gt;</u>: They take <b>true</b>, <b>false</b>, <b>0</b> or <b>1</b> as arguments.  For example,  <b>--use-second-</b>
       <b>screen</b> <b>false</b> can be expressed as <b>--use-second-screen</b> <b>0</b> or shortened to <b>-u0</b>.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Show summary of options.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--full-page</b>
              Use  the  presentation  program  with a normal single-screen PDF, that is display the full page on
              both the primary and secondary monitor.

              The secondary screen still contains timers and thumbnails to  help  you  with  your  presentation,
              unless you disable them using the options below.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--use-second-screen</b> <u>&lt;bool&gt;</u>
              Controls whether the program actually works as a dual-screen viewer.

              The default is true.

              If  you only have one screen, but still want to use the cache features, you can set this option to
              false. If the window ends up on the wrong display, you can  still  use  the  switch  command  (see
              below).

              What comes out on the primary screen depends on whether you use the -f Option: -u0 -f results in a
              simple full-screen PDF viewer, while -u0 without -f still splits the page in half and outputs only
              the left frame.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--hyperlink-support</b> <u>&lt;bool&gt;</u>
              Controls whether the program makes PDF Hyperlinks clickable.

              The default is true.

              While  it  is normally desired to have clickable hyperlinks, if you cannot control the position of
              your pointer (if your remote control has only left-click and right-click) it  might  be  safer  to
              disable hyperlinks.

       <b>--prerender-previous-pages</b> <u>n</u>
              When jumping to slide m, also pre-render the slides (m-n)..(m-1) (default 3)

              Note:  If you set this to zero, you will not get a thumbnail for the previous page rendered before
              you have visited it.

       <b>--prerender-next-pages</b> <u>n</u>
              When jumping to slide m, also pre-render the slides (m+1)..(m+n) (default 10)

              Note: If you set this to zero, you will not get a thumbnail for the next page rendered before  you
              have visited it.

       <b>--cache-size</b> <u>n</u> (in megabytes / MiB)
              This  controls  how  much  memory  dspdfviewer  is allowed to use for caching rendered pages.  The
              default value is 1024, meaning 1 GiB of RAM.  Note that  the  memory  used  for  active  rendering
              processes,  as  well  as the currently displayed images are not included in the accounting, so the
              total memory usage of dspdfviewer will be higher than this.

              CAVEAT: It is currently not verified that this memory is enough to hold all prerendered pages.  If
              you make the cache too small to hold the prerendered pages,  it  will  start  dropping  the  first
              rendered  (adjacent  to the current page), resulting in very poor performance.  If in doubt, set a
              larger cache or a lower prerender amount.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--presenter-area</b> <u>&lt;bool&gt;</u>
              Show (true, 1) or hide (false, 0) the presenter's area on the second screen.  If this  is  set  to
              zero, the following options will have no effect.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--duplicate</b> <u>&lt;bool&gt;</u>
              Duplicate  (true,  1)  or  hide  (false,  0) the audience's screen next to the notes on the second
              screen.  The default is false.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--thumbnails</b> <u>&lt;bool&gt;</u>
              Show (true, 1) or hide (false, 0) the thumbnails on the second screen.

       <b>-T,</b> <b>--thumbnail-page-part</b> <u>&lt;pagepart&gt;</u>
              Show this part of the page for thumbnails, valid values are "left", "right" or "both".

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--wall-clock</b> <u>&lt;bool&gt;</u>
              Show (true, 1) or hide (false, 0) the wall clock on the second screen.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--presentation-clock</b> <u>&lt;bool&gt;</u>
              Show (true, 1) or hide (false, 0) the presentation clock on the second screen.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--slide-clock</b> <u>&lt;bool&gt;</u>
              Show (true, 1) or hide (false, 0) the slide clock on the second screen.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--bottom-pane-height</b> <u>n</u>
              Configure how large the presenter area on the second screen will be, unit  is  <u>percent</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>second</u>
              <u>screen's</u> <u>total</u> <u>height</u>.

              Default value 20.

       <b>--i3-workaround</b> <u>&lt;bool&gt;</u>
              This  tries  to  ask  the  i3  window manager (by calling the i3-msg command) to move the audience
              window to "the other screen".

              This  is   considered   an   experimental   feature   and   disabled   by   default.    Read   the
              runtimeconfiguration.cpp source code for more info.

</pre><h4><b>CONTROLS</b></h4><pre>
       You can use the following controls while <b>dspdfviewer</b> is running.

       Note that mouse-clicks are subject to pointer position if the hyperlink support is enabled. If your mouse
       cursor changes to a hand, it will follow the link you are hovering on a click.

       <b>Keyboard:</b> <b>?,</b> <b>F1</b>
              Display quick-help (most important key bindings)

       <b>Keyboard:</b> <b>Spacebar,</b> <b>Page</b> <b>Down</b> <b>/</b> <b>Mouse:</b> <b>Left-Click,</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>Down</b>
              Go one page forward

              Additional keyboard aliases: Down, Right, Return, Enter, N, F

       <b>Keyboard:</b> <b>Backspace,</b> <b>Page</b> <b>Up</b> <b>/</b> <b>Mouse:</b> <b>Right-Click,</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>Up</b>
              Go one page backward

              Additional keyboard aliases: Up, Left, P

       <b>Keyboard:</b> <b>B,</b> <b>.</b> <b>(period)</b>
              Toggle blanking of the audience screen

       <b>Keyboard:</b> <b>G</b>
              Go to specific page (a number entry window will pop up)

              Note  that  the  this  counts  PDF pages, so a single slide having 6 unmasking steps will be 7 PDF
              pages long, including the initial near-blank page.

       <b>Keyboard:</b> <b>Home,</b> <b>H</b>
              Go to the first page and reset the clocks to zero.

              Use this if you want the clocks to stop at zero, use the G (goto) function to page 1 if  you  want
              to them to keep running.

              Note that the Home key may be called "Pos 1" on some keyboards.

       <b>Keyboard:</b> <b>Escape,</b> <b>Q</b>
              Quit <b>dspdfviewer</b>.

       <b>Keyboard:</b> <b>S,</b> <b>F12</b>
              Switch primary and secondary screens

              Use this if the audience sees your 'note' side with the clocks and you see the actual presentation
              on your screen.

              If  you just want to see the main presentation (for example, because the projector is behind you),
              use <b>T</b>.

       <b>Keyboard:</b> <b>T</b>
              Switch secondary screen's function

              Use this if you want to see the audience side on your screen, without showing  the  notes  to  the
              audience. Pressing the button again will switch back to normal operation.

       <b>Keyboard:</b> <b>D</b>
              Switch duplication of the audience's screen

              Use  this  if  you  want  to  see  the  audience  side  and  the notes on your screen (so the full
              presentation), leaving the audience's screen untouched. Pressing the button again will switch back
              to split mode.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="file:~/.config/dspdfviewer.ini">~/.config/dspdfviewer.ini</a></b>
              You can specify all long command-line options (without  leading  --)  here,  in  a  "option=value"
              format, one per line.

</pre><h4><b>PRESENTER</b> <b>REMOTE</b> <b>CONTROLS</b></h4><pre>
       Most  (maybe  not  all)  presenter  remote  controls  technically  act  as  a keyboard sending one of the
       keystrokes listed either in the main or additional keybindings. If your remote control does not  work  as
       intended, please file a bug report describing what keystrokes it generates when you press its buttons. If
       there is no conflict, a keybinding will be included in the next release.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       None currently known.

       If  you  find  any  bugs,  the  preferred  way  to  report  them  is  at  the  github  issue  tracker  at
       https://github.com/dannyedel/dspdfviewer/issues.

       As a fallback, you can send e-mail to <a href="mailto:mail@danny-edel.de">mail@danny-edel.de</a> with the word "dspdfviewer" in the subject line.
