</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>x2vnc</u>  will  let  you  use  two  screens on two different computers as if they were connected to the same
       computer. The computer with the 'main' keyboard must be running X-window, and the second computer  should
       have  a  VNC  server  running which will update the contents on the actual screen. This means <u>Xvnc</u> is not
       suitable, but <u>WinVNC</u> is.

       In listen mode ( <b>-listen</b> option specified ) <u>x2vnc</u> will wait for a connection from a VNC server  on  ports
       5400 and 5500 (plus the optional <u>display#</u> value) instead of connecting to a specified VNC server.

       For up-to-date information on x2vnc, see the x2vnc home page: <b><a href="http://fredrik.hubbe.net/x2vnc.html">http://fredrik.hubbe.net/x2vnc.html</a></b>

       <b>-display</b> <u>display</u>
              The X windows display to connect from.

       <b>-shared</b>
              Allow multiple connections to the same VNC server.

       <b>-north</b>, <b>-south</b>, <b>-east</b>, <b>-west</b>,
              Determine which edge leads to the other screen.

       <b>-passwdfile</b> <u>password-file</u>
              With this option you can start x2vnc without entering a password. The file is created by <b>vncpasswd</b>
              which  comes  with  the  X-windows VNC software.  If the file does not exist, <u>x2vnc</u> will ask for a
              password and create the file.

       <b>-resurface</b>
              This option will cause the trigger window to re-surface automatically  if  it  is  covered  up  by
              another window.

       <b>-hotkey</b> <u>key</u>
              This option allows you to select which key to use to warp the pointer to and from second computer.
              The  default  is "Control-F12", any combination of modifiers can be used, such as "shift-alt-meta-
              ctrl-F1" (or s-a-m-c-F1).

       <b>-edgewidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
              This is a workaround for some X servers which do not allow the mouse to go all the way to the edge
              of the screen. By setting this to 2 or greater, the mouse will be able to reach the  x2vnc  window
              and  thus  warp  to  the  windows  machine. The default value is 1. If you set this value to 0, no
              border will be generated, which means you will have to use hotkeys to switch to the oher screen.

       <b>-desktop</b> <u>desktop-number</u>
              With this option, you can make x2vnc non-sticky. This may not work with all window-managers.  Note
              that  the  first  desktop is usually 0 (zero). If you want x2vnc to appear on the last (rightmost)
              desktop, use -1.  This option was especially  created  with  the  sawfish  edgeflipping  in  mind,
              normally  you  would  use  "-west  -desktop  0"  or  "-east  -destkop  -1"  with  Sawfish to allow
              edgeflipping to work normally.

       <b>-timeout</b> <u>seconds</u>
              This options tells x2vnc how long to wait before warping the cursor back to the X screen if  there
              is  no  activity.  The  reason  for  this is that some screen savers, such as xscreensaver, cannot
              activate while x2vnc is in control of the cursor. The default  value  is  590  seconds,  which  is
              equivalent to 9 minutes and 50 seconds. Using a value of 0 will disable timeouts completely.

       <b>-nowheel</b>
              This option does nothing and is left for backwards compatibility only.

       <b>-wheelhack</b>
              This  will  make x2vnc tranlate all mouse wheel events into arrow up/down events. Only use this if
              your VNC server doesn't understand mouse wheel events.

       <b>-reversewheel</b>
              Invert the up/down direction of the mouse wheel emulation.  This option only works  if  -wheelhack
              is used.

       <b>-scrolllines</b> <u>lines</u>
              When  using mouse wheel emulation, this selects how many up/down events will be sent for each tick
              of the mouse wheel.

       <b>-navhack</b>
              This will map button 6 &amp; 7 to Alt+Left/Right, which will allow the navigation buttons on some mice
              to behave more like they do in windows.

       <b>-mac</b>   Macintosh specific mode, maps second mouse button to control-mouseclick.

       <b>-trimsel</b>
              If the X selection looks like a URL, trim leading and trailing spaces.  This  can  be  useful  for
              pasting URLs into a browser.

       <b>-noblank</b>
              Prevent screen blanking on the remote desktop while you are working on the local desktop. Requires
              the  MIT-SCREEN-SAVER  or  XIDLE  extension  to  work properly. If neither of these extensions are
              present, the remote desktop will always be kept from blanking.

       <b>-lockdelay</b> <u>seconds</u>
              This is only meaningful when using the -noblank option. When this option  is  present.  With  this
              option,  x2vnc  will  not attempt to wake up the remote screen if you have been idle for more than
              the specified amount of time. This is useful if you need a password to unlock  the  remote  screen
              and would rather leave it blanked until you need it.

       <b>-debug</b> This option will make x2vnc print out information about events it sends and receives to stderr for
              debugging purposes.

       <b>-accel</b> <u>multiplier</u>
              This  option allows you to control the speed of the mouse on the remote screen. 2.0 means twice as
              fast, 0.5 means half as fast.  Default is 1.0. Note that this is multiplied with  a  number  which
              x2vnc calculates based on screen sizes and other factors.

       <b>-noreconnect</b>
              This option prevents x2vnc from automatically reconnecting if the connection is closed.

       <b>-tunnel</b>
              This  option  makes  x2vnc  start  an SSH tunnel to the machine being controlled by x2vnc. The SSH
              command used can be changed by setting the X2VNC_SSH_CMD environment variable. The default is:
              <b>ssh</b> <b>-A</b> <b>-X</b> <b>-f</b> <b>-L</b> <b>"$LOCALPORT:$REMOTEHOST:$REMOTEPORT"</b> <b>\</b>
              <b>"$GATEWAYHOST"</b> <b>'ssh-add;sleep</b> <b>60'</b>

       <b>-via</b> <u>host</u>
              This is similar to -tunnel, but tunnels through a host different than the machine being controlled
              by x2vnc.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Most common usage:
       <b>x2vnc</b> <b>-passwdfile</b> <b>$HOME/.vncpasswd</b> <b>-resurface</b> <b>host:0</b>

       To make x2vnc start (and re-start) automatically, add the following to your your X startup file  (usually
       .xinitrc):
        <b>while</b> <b>:;</b>
       <b>do</b>
         <b>x2vnc</b> <b>-passwd</b> <b>$HOME/.vncpasswd</b> <b>-resurface</b> <b>host:0</b>
         <b>sleep</b> <b>2</b>
       <b>done</b>
