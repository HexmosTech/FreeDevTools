</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       yasr - (Yet Another Screen Reader) is an attempt at a lightweight, portable screen reader.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>yasr</b> [ <b>-C</b> <u>config</u> <u>file</u> ] [ <b>-c</b> ] [ <b>-s</b> <u>synthesizer</u> ] [ <b>-p</b> <u>synthesizer</u> <u>port</u> ] [ program arg1 arg2 ... argN ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>yasr</u>  is a lightweight, portable screen reader. It works by opening a shell in a pty and intercepting all
       user input/output, maintaining a window of what should be on the screen by looking at the codes and  text
       sent to the screen. It only requires that the user be able to access the text to speech (TTS) device.

       <u>yasr</u>  was  originally designed in conjunction with a Speak-out TTS device.  Yasr also attempts to support
       DEC-Talk, DoubleTalk, Apollo, and ViaVoice Outloud,  but more work is needed to get these to work  fully.
       It may be able to work with Emacspeak servers, however.

       Currently  <u>yasr</u> has two sets of keymaps, one for "review mode" (ie, reviewing the screen) and one for the
       standard mode.  Keys defined for the standard mode are checked irrespective of whether  the  user  is  in
       review mode or standard mode, but the review mode keymap is checked first in the former case.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-C</b> <u>config</u> <u>file</u>
              The configuration file that yasr should use.

       <b>-c</b>     Attempts  to emulate bash's -c command. It runs <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>,</u> passing it the arguments that were passed
              to <u>yasr.</u>

       <b>-s</b> <u>synthesizer</u>
              The TTS synthesizer to use in conjunction with <u>yasr.</u>

       <b>-p</b> <u>synthesizer</u> <u>port</u>
              The port that the TTS synthesizer is connected to.

       <u>yasr</u> will also fork and exec a program to run, if it (and any optional command line arguments  it  needs)
       are given as the last command line arguments.
