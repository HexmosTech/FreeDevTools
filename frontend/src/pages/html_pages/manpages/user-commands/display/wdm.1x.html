</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wdm - WINGs Display Manager

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wdm</b> <b>[</b> <b>options</b> <b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wdm</b>  is  an  X  display  manager based on the original X11 X Display Manager (xdm).  It features numerous
       functionality improvements, including the ability to reboot or halt the machine (once the proper password
       has been supplied) and to select from a list of available X sessions to start.  The  look  of  the  login
       panel is somewhat configurable, too.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Except for <b>-config</b>, all of these options can be specified as resources.

       <b>-config</b> <u>configuration_file</u>
              Names  the  configuration  file,  which  specifies  resources  to  control  the  behavior  of <u>wdm</u>.
              <u>#configdir#/wdm-config</u> is the default.

       <b>-nodaemon</b>
              Specifies ``false'' as the value for the <b>DisplayManager.daemonMode</b> resource. This  suppresses  the
              normal  daemon  behavior, which is for <u>wdm</u> to close all file descriptors, disassociate itself from
              the controlling terminal, and put itself in the background when it first starts up.

       <b>-debug</b> <u>debug_level</u>
              Specifies the numeric value for the <b>DisplayManager.debugLevel</b> resource.  A non-zero  value  causes
              <u>wdm</u>   to   print   lots   of   debugging   statements  to  the  terminal;  it  also  disables  the
              <b>DisplayManager.daemonMode</b>  resource,  forcing  <u>wdm</u>  to  run  synchronously.   To  interpret  these
              debugging  messages, a copy of the source code for <u>wdm</u> is almost a necessity.  No attempt has been
              made to rationalize or standardize the output.

       <b>-error</b> <u>error_log_file</u>
              Specifies the value for the <b>DisplayManager.errorLogFile</b> resource.  This file contains errors  from
              <u>wdm</u>  as  well  as  anything  written  to stderr by the various scripts and programs run during the
              progress of the session.

       <b>-syslog</b> <u>facility</u>
              Specifies the value for the <b>DisplayManager.syslogFacility</b> resource. This is factility to use  with
              all messages if log is redirected to syslog.

       <b>-usesyslog</b>
              Specifies  ``true''  as  the  value for the <b>DisplayManager.useSyslog</b> resource. This will force all
              messages go to syslog with facility specified by <b>DisplayManager.syslogFacility</b> resource.

       <b>-useerrfile</b>
              Specifies ``false'' as the value for the <b>DisplayManager.useSyslog</b> resource. This  will  force  all
              messages go to log file specified by <b>DisplayManager.errorLogFile</b> resource.

       <b>-resources</b> <u>resource_file</u>
              Specifies  the value for the <b>DisplayManager*resources</b> resource.  This file is loaded using <u>xrdb</u> to
              specify configuration parameters for the authentication widget.

       <b>-server</b> <u>server_entry</u>
              Specifies the value for the <b>DisplayManager.servers</b> resource.

       <b>-udpPort</b> <u>port_number</u>
              Specifies the value for the <b>DisplayManager.requestPort</b> resource.  This sets the port-number  which
              <u>wdm</u>  will  monitor for XDMCP requests.  As XDMCP uses the registered well-known UDP port 177, this
              resource should not be changed except for debugging. If set to 0 wdm will not listen for XDMCP  or
              Chooser requests.

       <b>-session</b> <u>session_program</u>
              Specifies the value for the <b>DisplayManager*session</b> resource.  This indicates the program to run as
              the session after the user has logged in.

       <b>-xrm</b> <u>resource_specification</u>
              Allows an arbitrary resource to be specified, as in most X Toolkit applications.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       At  many  stages the actions of <u>wdm</u> can be controlled through the use of its configuration file, which is
       in the X resource format.  Some resources modify the behavior of <u>wdm</u> on all displays, while others modify
       its behavior on a single display.  Where actions relate to  a  specific  display,  the  display  name  is
       inserted into the resource name between ``DisplayManager'' and the final resource name segment.

       For local displays, the resource name and class are as read from the <u>Xservers</u> file.

       For  remote  displays, the resource name is what the network address of the display resolves to.  See the
       <b>removeDomain</b> resource.  The name must match exactly; <u>wdm</u> is not aware of all  the  network  aliases  that
       might  reach  a given display.  If the name resolve fails, the address is used.  The resource class is as
       sent by the display in the XDMCP Manage request.

       Because the resource manager uses colons to separate the name of the resource from its value and dots  to
       separate  resource  name  parts, <u>wdm</u> substitutes underscores for both dots and colons when generating the
       resource name.  For example, <b>DisplayManager.expo_x_org_0.startup</b>  is  the  name  of  the  resource  which
       defines the startup shell file for the ``expo.x.org:0'' display.

       <b>DisplayManager.servers</b>
              This  resource  either  specifies  a  file name full of server entries, one per line (if the value
              starts with a slash), or a single server entry.  See the section <b>Local</b>  <b>Server</b>  <b>Specification</b>  for
              the details.

       <b>DisplayManager.requestPort</b>
              This  indicates  the UDP port number which <u>wdm</u> uses to listen for incoming XDMCP requests.  Unless
              you need to debug the system, leave this with its default value of 177.

       <b>DisplayManager.errorLogFile</b>
              Error output is normally directed at the system console.  To redirect it, set this resource  to  a
              file  name.   A  method  to  send  these  messages to <u>syslog</u> should be developed for systems which
              support  it;  however,  the  wide  variety  of   interfaces   precludes   any   system-independent
              implementation.   This  file  also contains any output directed to stderr by the <u>Xsetup,</u> <u>Xstartup,</u>
              <u>Xsession</u> and <u>Xreset</u> files, so it will contain descriptions of problems in those scripts as well.

       <b>DisplayManager.debugLevel</b>
              If the integer value of this resource is greater than zero, reams of debugging information will be
              printed.  It also disables daemon mode, which would redirect the information into the  bit-bucket,
              and allows non-root users to run <u>wdm,</u> which would normally not be useful.

       <b>DisplayManager.daemonMode</b>
              Normally,  <u>wdm</u> attempts to make itself into a daemon process unassociated with any terminal.  This
              is accomplished by forking and leaving the parent process to exit, then closing  file  descriptors
              and  releasing the controlling terminal.  In some environments this is not desired (in particular,
              when debugging).  Setting this resource to ``false'' will disable this feature.

       <b>DisplayManager.pidFile</b>
              The filename specified will be created to contain an ASCII representation of the process-id of the
              main <u>wdm</u> process.  <u>Xdm</u> also uses file locking on  this  file  to  attempt  to  eliminate  multiple
              daemons running on the same machine, which would cause quite a bit of havoc.

       <b>DisplayManager.lockPidFile</b>
              This  is  the  resource  which  controls  whether  <u>wdm</u>  uses file locking to keep multiple display
              managers from running amok.  On System V, this uses the <u>lockf</u> library call, while on BSD  it  uses
              <u>flock.</u>

       <b>DisplayManager.authDir</b>
              This  names a directory under which <u>wdm</u> stores authorization files while initializing the session.
              The  default   value   is   <u>#configdir#.</u>    Can   be   overridden   for   specific   displays   by
              DisplayManager.<u>DISPLAY</u>.authFile.

       <b>DisplayManager.autoRescan</b>
              This  boolean  controls  whether  <u>wdm</u>  rescans  the  configuration,  servers,  access  control and
              authentication keys files after a session terminates and the files have changed.  By default it is
              ``true.''  You can force <u>wdm</u> to reread these files by sending a SIGHUP to the main process.

       <b>DisplayManager.removeDomainname</b>
              When computing the display name for XDMCP clients, the name resolver will typically create a fully
              qualified host name for the terminal.  As this is sometimes confusing, <u>wdm</u> will remove the  domain
              name  portion  of  the  host name if it is the same as the domain name of the local host when this
              variable is set.  By default the value is ``true.''

       <b>DisplayManager.keyFile</b>
              XDM-AUTHENTICATION-1 style XDMCP authentication requires that a private key be shared between  <u>wdm</u>
              and  the  terminal.   This resource specifies the file containing those values.  Each entry in the
              file consists of a display name and the shared key.  By default, <u>wdm</u> does not include support  for
              XDM-AUTHENTICATION-1,  as  it  requires DES which is not generally distributable because of United
              States export restrictions.

       <b>DisplayManager.accessFile</b>
              To prevent unauthorized XDMCP service and to allow forwarding  of  XDMCP  IndirectQuery  requests,
              this file contains a database of hostnames which are either allowed direct access to this machine,
              or  have  a  list  of  hosts  to which queries should be forwarded to.  The format of this file is
              described in the section <b>XDMCP</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control.</b>

       <b>DisplayManager.exportList</b>
              A list of additional environment variables, separated by white space, to pass on  to  the  <u>Xsetup</u>,
              <u>Xstartup</u>, <u>Xsession</u>, and <u>Xreset</u> programs.

       <b>DisplayManager.randomFile</b>
              A file to checksum to generate the seed of authorization keys.  This should be a file that changes
              frequently.  The default is <u>/dev/urandom</u>.

       <b>DisplayManager.greeterLib</b>
              On  systems  that  support  a  dynamically-loadable greeter library, the name of the library.  The
              default is <u>/usr/lib/X11/xdm/libXdmGreet.so</u>.  <u>This</u> <u>not</u> <u>used</u> <u>in</u> <u>Debian.</u>

       <b>DisplayManager.choiceTimeout</b>
              Number of seconds to wait for display to respond after user has selected a host from the  chooser.
              If  the  display  sends  an  XDMCP IndirectQuery within this time, the request is forwarded to the
              chosen host.  Otherwise, it is assumed to be from a new session and the chooser is offered  again.
              Default is 15.

       <b>DisplayManager.sourceAddress</b>
              Use  the  numeric  IP  address  of the incoming connection on multihomed hosts instead of the host
              name. This is to avoid trying to connect on the wrong interface which might be down at this time.

       <b>DisplayManager.willing</b>
              This specifies a program which is run (as) root when an an XDMCP BroadcastQuery  is  received  and
              this  host  is  configured  to  offer  XDMCP display management. The output of this program may be
              displayed on a chooser window.  If no program is specified, the string <u>Willing</u> <u>to</u> <u>manage</u> is sent.

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.resources</b>
              This resource specifies the name of the file to be loaded by <u>xrdb</u> as the  resource  database  onto
              the  root  window  of  screen 0 of the display.  The <u>Xsetup</u> program, the Login widget, and <u>chooser</u>
              will use the resources set in this file.  This resource  data  base  is  loaded  just  before  the
              authentication  procedure  is  started, so it can control the appearance of the login window.  See
              the section <b>Authentication</b> <b>Widget,</b> which describes the various resources that are  appropriate  to
              place  in  this  file.  There is no default value for this resource, but <u>#configdir#/Xresources</u> is
              the conventional name.

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.chooser</b>
              Specifies the program run to offer a host menu for Indirect queries redirected to the special host
              name CHOOSER.  <u>/usr/lib/X11/xdm/chooser</u> is the default.  See the sections <b>XDMCP</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> and
              <b>Chooser</b>.

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.xrdb</b>
              Specifies the program used to load the resources.  By default, <u>wdm</u> uses <u>/usr/bin/xrdb</u>.

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.cpp</b>
              This specifies the name of the C preprocessor which is used by <u>xrdb</u>.

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.setup</b>
              This specifies a program which is run (as root) before offering the Login  window.   This  may  be
              used  to  change  the  appearance of the screen around the Login window or to put up other windows
              (e.g., you may want to run <u>xconsole</u> here).  By default, no program is run.  The conventional  name
              for a file used here is <u>Xsetup</u>.  See the section <b>Setup</b> <b>Program.</b>

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.startup</b>
              This  specifies  a  program  which is run (as root) after the authentication process succeeds.  By
              default, no program is run.  The conventional name for a file used  here  is  <u>Xstartup</u>.   See  the
              section <b>Startup</b> <b>Program.</b>

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.session</b>
              This specifies the session to be executed (not running as root).  By default, <u>/usr/bin/x-terminal-</u>
              <u>emulator</u> is run.  The conventional name is <u>Xsession</u>.  See the section <b>Session</b> <b>Program.</b>

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.reset</b>
              This  specifies  a  program  which  is run (as root) after the session terminates.  By default, no
              program is run.  The conventional name is <u>Xreset</u>.  See the section <b>Reset</b> <b>Program.</b>

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.openDelay</b>

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.openRepeat</b>

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.openTimeout</b>

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.startAttempts</b>
              These numeric resources control the behavior of <u>wdm</u> when attempting to open intransigent  servers.
              <b>openDelay</b>  is  the length of the pause (in seconds) between successive attempts, <b>openRepeat</b> is the
              number of attempts to make, <b>openTimeout</b> is the amount of time to wait  while  actually  attempting
              the  open  (i.e.,  the  maximum time spent in the <u><a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</a></u>(2) system call) and <b>startAttempts</b> is the
              number of times this entire process is done before giving up  on  the  server.   After  <b>openRepeat</b>
              attempts  have  been  made,  or  if  <b>openTimeout</b>  seconds  elapse  in  any particular attempt, <u>wdm</u>
              terminates and restarts the server,  attempting  to  connect  again.   This  process  is  repeated
              <b>startAttempts</b>  times,  at  which  point  the display is declared dead and disabled.  Although this
              behavior may seem arbitrary, it has been empirically  developed  and  works  quite  well  on  most
              systems.   The  default values are 5 for <b>openDelay</b>, 5 for <b>openRepeat</b>, 30 for <b>openTimeout</b> and 4 for
              <b>startAttempts</b>.

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.pingInterval</b>

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.pingTimeout</b>
              To discover when remote displays disappear, <u>wdm</u> occasionally pings them, using an X connection and
              <u>XSync</u> calls.  <b>pingInterval</b> specifies the time (in minutes) between each ping attempt,  <b>pingTimeout</b>
              specifies  the  maximum  amount  of  time  (in minutes) to wait for the terminal to respond to the
              request.  If the terminal does not respond, the session  is  declared  dead  and  terminated.   By
              default,  both  are set to 5 minutes.  If you frequently use X terminals which can become isolated
              from the managing host, you may wish to increase this value.  The only worry is that sessions will
              continue to exist after the terminal has been accidentally disabled.   <u>wdm</u>  will  not  ping  local
              displays.   Although  it  would  seem  harmless,  it is unpleasant when the workstation session is
              terminated as a result of the server hanging for NFS service and not responding to the ping.

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.terminateServer</b>
              This boolean resource specifies  whether  the  X  server  should  be  terminated  when  a  session
              terminates  (instead  of  resetting  it).   This  option can be used when the server tends to grow
              without bound over time, in order to limit the amount of time the  server  is  run.   The  default
              value is ``false.''

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.userPath</b>
              <u>Xdm</u>  sets  the  PATH  environment  variable  for  the session to this value.  It should be a colon
              separated list of directories; see <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1) for a full description.  ``:<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/games">/usr/games</a>'' is
              a common setting.  The default value can be specified at build time in the X system  configuration
              file with DefaultUserPath.

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.systemPath</b>
              <u>Xdm</u>  sets  the  PATH  environment  variable for the startup and reset scripts to the value of this
              resource.  The default for this resource is specified at build time by the DefaultSystemPath entry
              in the system configuration file; ``<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>:<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>'' is a common choice.  Note the absence  of
              ``.''  from  this entry.  This is a good practice to follow for root; it avoids many common Trojan
              Horse system penetration schemes.

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.systemShell</b>
              <u>Xdm</u> sets the SHELL environment variable for the startup and reset scripts to  the  value  of  this
              resource.  It is <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u> by default.

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.failsafeClient</b>
              If  the  default  session  fails  to execute, <u>wdm</u> will fall back to this program.  This program is
              executed with no arguments, but executes using the same environment variables as the session would
              have had (see the section <b>Session</b> <b>Program</b>).  By default, <u>/usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator</u> is used.

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.grabServer</b>

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.grabTimeout</b>
              To improve security, <u>wdm</u> grabs the server and keyboard while reading the login name and  password.
              The  <b>grabServer</b>  resource  specifies  if  the  server  should  be  held  for  the  duration of the
              name/password reading.  When ``false,'' the server is ungrabbed after the keyboard grab  succeeds,
              otherwise  the  server is grabbed until just before the session begins.  The default is ``false.''
              The <b>grabTimeout</b> resource specifies the maximum time <u>wdm</u> will wait for the grab  to  succeed.   The
              grab  may  fail  if some other client has the server grabbed, or possibly if the network latencies
              are very high.  This resource has a default value of  3  seconds;  you  should  be  cautious  when
              raising  it,  as  a user can be spoofed by a look-alike window on the display.  If the grab fails,
              <u>wdm</u> kills and restarts the server (if possible) and the session.

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.authorize</b>

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.authName</b>
              <b>authorize</b> is a boolean resource which controls whether <u>wdm</u> generates and  uses  authorization  for
              the  local  server  connections.   If  authorization  is used, <b>authName</b> is a list of authorization
              mechanisms to use,  separated  by  white  space.   XDMCP  connections  dynamically  specify  which
              authorization  mechanisms  are  supported, so <b>authName</b> is ignored in this case.  When <b>authorize</b> is
              set for a display and authorization is not available, the user is informed by having  a  different
              message  displayed  in  the  login widget.  By default, <b>authorize</b> is ``true.''  <b>authName</b> is ``MIT-
              MAGIC-COOKIE-1,''  or,  if  XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1  is  available,   ``XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 MIT-MAGIC-
              COOKIE-1.''

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.authFile</b>
              This  file  is  used to communicate the authorization data from <u>wdm</u> to the server, using the <b>-auth</b>
              server command line option.  It should be kept in a directory which is not  world-writable  as  it
              could easily be removed, disabling the authorization mechanism in the server.  If not specified, a
              name is generated from DisplayManager.authDir and the name of the display.

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.authComplain</b>
              If  set  to  ``false,''  disables  the  use  of the <b>unsecureGreeting</b> in the login window.  See the
              section <b>Authentication</b> <b>Widget.</b>  The default is ``true.''

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.resetSignal</b>
              The number of the signal <u>wdm</u> sends to reset the server.  See the section <b>Controlling</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>Server.</b>
              The default is 1 (SIGHUP).

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.termSignal</b>
              The  number  of  the  signal  <u>wdm</u>  sends to terminate the server.  See the section <b>Controlling</b> <b>the</b>
              <b>Server.</b>  The default is 15 (SIGTERM).

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.resetForAuth</b>
              The original implementation of authorization in the sample server reread the authorization file at
              server reset time, instead of  when  checking  the  initial  connection.   As  <u>wdm</u>  generates  the
              authorization  information  just before connecting to the display, an old server would not get up-
              to-date authorization information.  This resource causes <u>wdm</u> to send SIGHUP to  the  server  after
              setting  up  the  file,  causing  an  additional  server reset to occur, during which time the new
              authorization information will be read.  The default is ``false,'' which will  work  for  all  MIT
              servers.

       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.userAuthDir</b>
              When <u>wdm</u> is unable to write to the usual user authorization file ($HOME/.Xauthority), it creates a
              unique  file  name in this directory and points the environment variable XAUTHORITY at the created
              file.  It uses <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> by default.

       <b>DisplayManager.wdmLogin</b>
              Specifies the path to <u><a href="../man1x/wdmLogin.1x.html">wdmLogin</a></u>(1x)

       <b>DisplayManager.wdmWm</b>
              Is a colon separated list of window managers to use as options in the login panel.  Note  that  if
              you  include  the path to the window manager, it will look <u>ugly</u>. You may set this resource to None
              if you want only NoChange to appear.

       <b>DisplayManager.wdmLogo</b>
              Path to the logo pixmap, several formats are accepted, read <u><a href="../man1x/wdmLogin.1x.html">wdmLogin</a></u>(1x) to find out more.

       <b>DisplayManager.wdmHelpFile</b>
              Path to a text file which will be displayed in the help panel, read <u><a href="../man1x/wdmLogin.1x.html">wdmLogin</a></u>(1x) to find out more.

       <b>DisplayManager.wdmDefaultUser</b>
              a default username which will be used if no username is typed.

       <b>DisplayManager.wdmDefaultPasswd</b>
              the clear text password of the default user above. BE VERY CAREFUL when using this two  resources,
              and don't forget to do: chmod 600 wdm-config ; chown root.root wdm-config

       <b>DisplayManager.wdmBg</b>
              Background  specification.  Read  the <b>BACKGROUND</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b> section to find out about the
              format.  If this is not specified, then the background is <b>not</b> set.

       <b>DisplayManager.wdmReboot</b>
              Reboot command.

       <b>DisplayManager.wdmHalt</b>
              Halt command.

       <b>DisplayManager.wdmVerify</b>
              If true, verify user's identity for reboot/halt/exit.

       <b>DisplayManager.wdmRoot</b>
              If true, user must be root to exit.

       <b>DisplayManager.wdmAnimations</b>
              If true, enable animations consisting of shaking the panel (if an error) and rolling up the  panel
              (when closing it).  If false, animations are disabled.

       <b>DisplayManager.wdmLocale</b>
              LANG environment variable will be set to value of this resource before starting wdmLogin.

       <b>DisplayManger.wdmCursorTheme</b>
              If  you  have  recent  version of XFree with support for transparent cursors you can select cursor
              theme to use on login panel.  XCURSOR_THEME environment variable will be  set  to  value  of  this
              resource before starting wdmLogin.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The default location of the <u>wdm</u> configuration file is <u>#configdir#/wdm-config</u>

       Here is a reasonable configuration file, which could be named <u>wdm-config</u>:

            DisplayManager.servers:            /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers
            DisplayManager.errorLogFile:       /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-errors
            DisplayManager*resources:          /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources
            DisplayManager*startup:            /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xstartup
            DisplayManager*session:            /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession
            DisplayManager.pidFile:            /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-pid
            DisplayManager._0.authorize:       true
            DisplayManager*authorize:          false

       Note  that this file mostly contains references to other files.  Note also that some of the resources are
       specified with ``*'' separating the components.  These resources can be made unique  for  each  different
       display,  by  replacing  the  ``*'' with the display-name, but normally this is not very useful.  See the
       <b>Resources</b> section for a complete discussion.  If the entry is a host name, all comparisons are done using
       network addresses, so any name which converts to the correct network address may be used.  For  patterns,
       only canonical host names are used in the comparison, so ensure that you do not attempt to match aliases.
       Preceding  either a host name or a pattern with a `!' character causes hosts which match that entry to be
       excluded.

       To only respond to  Direct  queries  for  a  host  or  pattern,  it  can  be  followed  by  the  optional
       ``NOBROADCAST''  keyword.   This  can  be  used to prevent an wdm server from appearing on menus based on
       Broadcast queries.

       An Indirect entry also contains a host name or pattern, but follows it with  a  list  of  host  names  or
       macros to which indirect queries should be sent.

       A macro definition contains a macro name and a list of host names and other macros that the macro expands
       to.  To distinguish macros from hostnames, macro names start with a `%' character.  Macros may be nested.

       Indirect  entries  may  also specify to have <u>wdm</u> run <u>chooser</u> to offer a menu of hosts to connect to.  See
       the section <b>Chooser</b>.

       When checking access for a particular display host, each entry is scanned in turn and the first  matching
       entry  determines  the  response.  Direct and Broadcast entries are ignored when scanning for an Indirect
       entry and vice-versa.

       Blank lines are ignored, `#' is treated as a comment delimiter causing  the  rest  of  that  line  to  be
       ignored,  and  `\<u>newline</u>' causes the newline to be ignored, allowing indirect host lists to span multiple
       lines.

       Here is an example Xaccess file:

       #
       # Xaccess - XDMCP access control file
       #

       #
       # Direct/Broadcast query entries
       #

       !xtra.lcs.mit.edu   # disallow direct/broadcast service for xtra
       bambi.ogi.edu       # allow access from this particular display
       *.lcs.mit.edu       # allow access from any display in LCS

       *.deshaw.com        NOBROADCAST         # allow only direct access
       *.gw.com                                # allow direct and broadcast

       #
       # Indirect query entries
       #

       %HOSTS              expo.lcs.mit.edu xenon.lcs.mit.edu \
                           excess.lcs.mit.edu kanga.lcs.mit.edu

       extract.lcs.mit.edu xenon.lcs.mit.edu   #force extract to contact xenon
       !xtra.lcs.mit.edu   dummy               #disallow indirect access
       *.lcs.mit.edu       %HOSTS              #all others get to choose

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>Xresources</u> file is loaded onto the display as a resource database using <u>xrdb.</u>  As the  authentication
       widget reads this database before starting up, it usually contains parameters for that widget:

            xlogin*login.translations: #override\
                 Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;R: abort-display()\n\
                 &lt;Key&gt;F1: set-session-argument(failsafe) finish-field()\n\
                 &lt;Key&gt;Return: set-session-argument() finish-field()
            xlogin*borderWidth: 3
            xlogin*greeting: CLIENTHOST
            #ifdef COLOR
            xlogin*greetColor: CadetBlue
            xlogin*failColor: red
            #endif

       Please  note the translations entry; it specifies a few new translations for the widget which allow users
       to escape from the default session (and avoid troubles that may occur in it).  Note that if #override  is
       not  specified,  the  default  translations  are removed and replaced by the new value, not a very useful
       result as some of the default translations are quite useful (such  as  ``&lt;Key&gt;:  insert-char  ()''  which
       responds to normal typing).

       This file may also contain resources for the setup program and <u>chooser</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SETUP</b> <b>PROGRAM</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>Xsetup</u>  file  is run after the server is reset, but before the Login window is offered.  The file is
       typically a shell script.  It is run as root, so should be careful about security.  This is the place  to
       change  the  root  background  or  bring up other windows that should appear on the screen along with the
       Login widget.

       In addition to any specified  by  <b>DisplayManager.exportList</b>,  the  following  environment  variables  are
       passed:

            DISPLAY        the associated display name
            PATH           the value of <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.systemPath</b>
            SHELL          the value of <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.systemShell</b>
            XAUTHORITY     may be set to an authority file

       Note  that  since  <u>wdm</u>  grabs the keyboard, any other windows will not be able to receive keyboard input.
       They will be able to interact with the mouse, however; beware  of  potential  security  holes  here.   If
       <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.grabServer</b>  is  set,  <u>Xsetup</u>  will  not  be able to connect to the display at all.
       Resources for this program can be put into the file named by <b>DisplayManager.</b><u>DISPLAY</u><b>.resources</b>.

       Here is a sample <u>Xsetup</u> script:

            #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
            # Xsetup_0 - setup script for one workstation
            xcmsdb &lt; /usr/local/lib/monitors/alex.0
            xconsole -geometry 480x130-0-0 -notify -verbose -exitOnFail &amp;

</pre><h4><b>BACKGROUND</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       There are several possible ways of specifying a background image. The generic format is <u>type</u>:<u>image</u>.  <u>type</u>
       can be any of:

       <b>none</b>   The backgound is <b>not</b> set.

       <b>solid</b>  it renders a solid background, and <u>image</u> is a color name

       <b>hgradient</b>, <b>vgradient</b>, <b>dgradient</b>
              a gradient (either horizontal, vertical or diagonal) will be rendered. <u>image</u> is <b>comma</b> <b>separated</b> of
              color names, and any number of colors can be specified.

       <b>pixmap</b> a pixmap will be used for the background. <u>image</u> is the full path to an image file (tiff, png, jpeg
              and xpm allowed) and it will be scaled to use the full screen.
