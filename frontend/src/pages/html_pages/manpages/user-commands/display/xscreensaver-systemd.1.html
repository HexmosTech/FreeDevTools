</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xscreensaver-systemd - lock the screen upon suspend, and inhibit screen-blanking during video playback.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xscreensaver-systemd</b> <b>[--verbose]</b> <b>[--version]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>xscreensaver-systemd</u>  program  is  a  helper  daemon  launched  by <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver.1.html">xscreensaver</a></b>(1) for <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) or
       <b><a href="../man8/elogind.8.html">elogind</a></b>(8) integration.  It does two things:

       <b>*</b> When the system is about to go to sleep (e.g., the laptop lid has just been closed) it locks the screen
         just <u>before</u> the system sleeps, by running <u>xscreensaver-command</u> <u>--suspend</u>.  When  the  system  wakes  up
         again, it runs <u>xscreensaver-command</u> <u>--deactivate</u> to make the unlock dialog appear immediately.  It does
         this through the <b><a href="../man5/org.freedesktop.login1.5.html">org.freedesktop.login1</a></b>(5) D-Bus interface.

       <b>*</b> When  another  process asks for the screen saver to be inhibited (e.g. because a video is playing) this
         program periodically runs <u>xscreensaver-command</u> <u>--deactivate</u> to keep the display  un-blanked.   It  does
         this   until  that  other  program  asks  for  it  to  stop,  or  exits.   It  does  this  through  the
         <b><a href="../man5/org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver.5.html">org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver</a></b>(5),                     <b><a href="../man5/org.gnome.SessionManager.5.html">org.gnome.SessionManager</a></b>(5)                     and
         <b><a href="../man5/org.kde.Solid.PowerManagement.PolicyAgent.5.html">org.kde.Solid.PowerManagement.PolicyAgent</a></b>(5) D-Bus interfaces.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Blanking-related  problems  take  two  forms:  failing to connect to D-Bus; and other programs requesting
       stupid things.

   <b>D-BUS</b>
       Only one program at a time can register with <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man8/elogind.8.html">elogind</a></b>(8) for screen-saver-related events, so
       if another screen saver is running as a part of the desktop  environment,  <u>xscreensaver-systemd</u>  will  be
       unable  to  launch.  This program has workarounds for Gnome and KDE, but if you are using something else,
       that might be a problem.

   <b>CHROME</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>CHROMIUM</b> <b>(101.0)</b>
       <b>*</b> Playing only audio in Chrome will prevent your screen from  blanking.   Chrome  sends  the  exact  same
         "inhibit" reason for audio as for video, so we can't tell them apart.

       <b>*</b> Chrome  prevents  your  screen  from blanking when playing short, looping videos.  This means that your
         screen won't blank when Chrome is showing a Twitter page (because those  animated  GIFs  aren't  really
         GIFs, they are MP4s).  This affects Tweetdeck as well.

         The  proper  way  to fix this would be for Chrome to stop inhibiting once a video loops.  That way your
         multi-hour movie inhibits properly, but your looping GIF only inhibits for the first few seconds.

       Firefox does not have either of these problems.

   <b>MPLAYER</b> <b>(2:1.4)</b>
       Makes no attempt to inhibit the screen saver.  Use VLC instead.

   <b>MPV</b> <b>(0.33)</b>
       Makes no attempt to inhibit the screen saver.  Use VLC instead.

   <b>VARIOUS</b>
       Most programs fail to re-enable screen blanking if they crash or are killed while  playing.   We  try  to
       detect  when this has happened, but that might not work with all versions of systemd, resulting in screen
       blanking remaining permanently disabled.  If that happens, killing and restarting <u>xscreensaver-systemd</u> is
       a workaround.
