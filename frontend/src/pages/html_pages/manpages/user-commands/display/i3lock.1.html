</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       i3lock - improved screen locker

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>i3lock</b> [-v] [-n] [-b] [-i <u>image.png</u>] [-c <u>color</u>] [-t] [-p <u>pointer]</u> [-u] [-e] [-f]

</pre><h4><b>RECOMMENDED</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       xss-lock --transfer-sleep-lock -- i3lock --nofork

       Using <b>xss-lock</b> ensures that your screen is locked before your laptop suspends.

       Notably,  using a systemd service file is not adequate, as it will not delay suspend until your screen is
       locked.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>i3lock</b> is a simple screen locker like slock. After starting it, you will see  a  white  screen  (you  can
       configure the color/an image). You can return to your screen by entering your password.

</pre><h4><b>IMPROVEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       • i3lock  forks,  so  you  can  combine  it  with  an  alias to suspend to RAM (run "i3lock &amp;&amp; echo mem &gt;
         <a href="file:/sys/power/state">/sys/power/state</a>" to get a locked screen after waking up your computer from suspend to RAM)

       • You can specify either a background color or a PNG image which will be displayed while your  screen  is
         locked.

       • You can specify whether i3lock should bell upon a wrong password.

       • i3lock uses PAM and therefore is compatible with LDAP, etc.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Display the version of your <b>i3lock</b>

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--nofork</b>
              Don't fork after starting.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--beep</b>
              Enable beeping. Be sure to not do this when you are about to annoy other people, like when opening
              your laptop in a boring lecture.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--no-unlock-indicator</b>
              Disable the unlock indicator. i3lock will by default show an unlock indicator after pressing keys.
              This  will  give  feedback  for every keypress and it will show you the current PAM state (whether
              your password is currently being verified or whether it is wrong).

       <b>-i</b> <u>path</u>, <b>--image=</b><u>path</u>
              Display the given PNG image instead of a blank screen.

       <b>--raw=</b><u>format</u>
              Read the image given by --image as a raw image instead of PNG. The argument is the image's  format
              as  &lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;:&lt;pixfmt&gt;.  The  supported pixel formats are: ´native', 'rgb', 'xrgb', 'rgbx',
              'bgr', 'xbgr', and 'bgrx'.  The "native" pixel format expects a pixel as a 32-bit (4-byte) integer
              in the machine's native endianness, with the upper 8 bits unused. Red, green and blue  are  stored
              in the remaining bits, in that order.

              <b>Example:</b>
                   --raw=1920x1080:rgb

              You can use ImageMagick’s <u><a href="../man1/convert.1.html">convert</a>(1)</u> program to feed raw images into i3lock:

                   convert wallpaper.jpg RGB:- | i3lock --raw 3840x2160:rgb --image <a href="file:/dev/stdin">/dev/stdin</a>

              This  allows  you  to  load  a  variety of image formats without i3lock having to support each one
              explicitly.

       <b>-c</b> <u>rrggbb</u>, <b>--color=</b><u>rrggbb</u>
              Turn the screen into the given color instead of white. Color  must  be  given  in  3-byte  format:
              rrggbb (i.e. ff0000 is red).

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--tiling</b>
              If  an image is specified (via -i) it will display the image tiled all over the screen (if it is a
              multi-monitor setup, the image is visible on all screens).

       <b>-p</b> <u>win|default</u>, <b>--pointer=</b><u>win|default</u>
              If you specify "default", <b>i3lock</b> does not hide your mouse pointer. If you  specify  "win",  <b>i3lock</b>
              displays  a  hardcoded  Windows-Pointer  (thus  enabling  you to mess with your friends by using a
              screenshot of a Windows desktop as a locking-screen).

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--ignore-empty-password</b>
              When an empty password is provided by the user, do not validate it. Without this option, the empty
              password will be provided to PAM and, if invalid, the user will have to wait a few seconds  before
              another  try.  This  can be useful if the XF86ScreenSaver key is used to put a laptop to sleep and
              bounce on resume or if you happen to wake up your computer with the enter key.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--show-failed-attempts</b>
              Show the number of failed attempts, if any.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--show-keyboard-layout</b>
              Show the current keyboard layout.

       <b>--debug</b>
              Enables debug logging.  Note, that this will log the password used for authentication to stdout.

</pre><h4><b>DPMS</b></h4><pre>
       The -d (--dpms) option was removed from i3lock in version 2.8. There were plenty of use-cases  that  were
       not  properly  addressed,  and  plenty  of bugs surrounding that feature. While features are not normally
       removed from i3 and its tools, we felt the need to make an exception in this case.

       Users who wish to explicitly enable DPMS only when their screen is locked can use a wrapper script around
       i3lock like the following:

            #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
            revert() {
              xset dpms 0 0 0
            }
            trap revert HUP INT TERM
            xset +dpms dpms 5 5 5
            i3lock -n
            revert

       The -I (--inactivity-timeout=seconds) was removed because it only makes sense with DPMS.
