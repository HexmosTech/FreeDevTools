</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xscreensaver - extensible screen saver and screen locking framework

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xscreensaver</b> [--display <u>host:display.screen</u>] [--verbose] [--version] [--no-splash] [--log <u>filename</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       XScreenSaver  waits  until  the user is idle, and then runs graphics demos chosen at random.  It can also
       lock your screen, and provides configuration and control of display power management.

       XScreenSaver is also available on macOS, iOS and Android.

</pre><h4><b>GETTING</b> <b>STARTED</b></h4><pre>
       XScreenSaver is a daemon that runs in the background.  You configure it with the <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-settings.1.html">xscreensaver-settings</a></b>(1)
       program.

            xscreensaver &amp;
            xscreensaver-settings

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>IT</b> <b>WORKS</b></h4><pre>
       When it is time to activate the screensaver, a full-screen black  window  is  created  that  covers  each
       monitor.   A  sub-process  is  launched  for each one running a graphics demo, pointed at the appropriate
       window.  Because of this, any program which can draw on a provided window can be used as  a  screensaver.
       The various graphics demos are, in fact, just standalone programs that do that.

       When  the  user  becomes active again, the screensaver windows are unmapped, and the running subprocesses
       are killed.

       The display modes are run at a low process priority, and  spend  most  of  their  time  sleeping/idle  by
       default, so they should not consume significant system resources.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--display</b> <u>host:display.screen</u>
               The  X  display to use.  For displays with multiple screens, XScreenSaver will manage all screens
               on the display simultaneously.

       <b>--verbose</b>
               Print diagnostics to stderr.

       <b>--version</b>
               Print the version number and exit.

       <b>--log</b> <u>filename</u>
               Append all diagnostic output to the given file.  This also  implies  <u>--verbose</u>.   Use  this  when
               reporting bugs.

       <b>--no-splash</b>
               Don't display the splash screen at startup.

</pre><h4><b>POWER</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-settings.1.html">xscreensaver-settings</a></b>(1)  program  is where you configure if and when your monitor should power off.
       It saves the settings in your <u><a href="file:~/.xscreensaver">~/.xscreensaver</a></u> file.  Do not use <b><a href="../man1/xset.1.html">xset</a></b>(1)  to  manually  change  the  power
       management settings, that won't work.

       When the monitor is powered down, the display hacks will stop running (though it may take a minute or two
       for XScreenSaver to notice).

</pre><h4><b>LAPTOP</b> <b>LIDS</b></h4><pre>
       If  your  system uses <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man8/elogind.8.html">elogind</a></b>(8), then closing the lid of your laptop will cause the screen
       to lock immediately.

       If not, then the screen might not lock until a few seconds <u>after</u> you re-open the lid.  Which is less than
       ideal.  So if you do not have <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1), you might want to get in the habit  of  manually  locking  your
       screen <u>before</u> closing the lid (<u>xscreensaver-command</u> <u>--lock</u>).

</pre><h4><b>PLAYING</b> <b>VIDEOS</b></h4><pre>
       Likewise,  if  you  have <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man8/elogind.8.html">elogind</a></b>(8), then all of the popular video players and web browsers
       will prevent XScreenSaver from blanking the screen while video is playing.

       Both of these features require that <b><a href="../man6/xscreensaver-systemd.6.html">xscreensaver-systemd</a></b>(6) be able connect to D-Bus.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       Each desktop environment has its own system for launching long-running  daemons  like  XScreenSaver,  and
       since  many of them come bundled with their own (buggy, insecure, inferior) screen-locking frameworks, it
       is also necessary to disable those other frameworks before XScreenSaver can work.

   <b>INSTALLING</b> <b>XSCREENSAVER</b> <b>ON</b> <b>GNOME</b> <b>OR</b> <b>UNITY</b>
       For many years, GNOME included XScreenSaver as-is, and everything just worked.  Not any more!

           <b>1:</b> <b>Fully</b> <b>uninstall</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>screen</b> <b>saver</b> <b>packages:</b>

                   sudo apt remove gnome-screensaver
                   sudo apt remove mate-screensaver
                   sudo apt remove cinnamon-screensaver
                   sudo apt remove light-locker
              or
                   sudo rpm -e gnome-screensaver
                   sudo rpm -e mate-screensaver
                   sudo rpm -e cinnamon-screensaver
                   sudo rpm -e light-locker

              Be careful that it doesn't try to uninstall all of GNOME.

           <b>2:</b> <b>Turn</b> <b>off</b> <b>GNOME's</b> <b>built-in</b> <b>blanking.</b>
              Set all of  the  following  settings  to  "<u>Never</u>"  or  "<u>Off</u>",  as  these  are  all  controlled  by
              <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-settings.1.html">xscreensaver-settings</a></b>(1) now:

              "<u>Settings</u> <u>/</u> <u>Privacy</u> <u>/</u> <u>Screen</u> <u>Lock</u> <u>/</u> <u>Blank</u> <u>Screen</u> <u>Delay</u>"
              "<u>Settings</u> <u>/</u> <u>Privacy</u> <u>/</u> <u>Screen</u> <u>Lock</u> <u>/</u> <u>Automatic</u> <u>Screen</u> <u>Lock</u>"
              "<u>Settings</u> <u>/</u> <u>Power</u> <u>/</u> <u>Blank</u> <u>Screen</u>"
              "<u>Settings</u> <u>/</u> <u>Power</u> <u>/</u> <u>Automatic</u> <u>Suspend</u>"

           <b>3:</b> <b>Launch</b> <b>XScreenSaver</b> <b>at</b> <b>login.</b>
              Launch  "<u>Tweaks</u>",  select  "<u>Startup</u>  <u>Applications</u>", click the plus sign, and select "<u>XScreenSaver</u>"
              (not "<u>XScreenSaver</u> <u>Settings</u>") from the (very long) menu.

              Or, see the "<u>LAUNCHING</u> <u>XSCREENSAVER</u> <u>FROM</u> <u>SYSTEMD</u>" section below.  That works too.

           <b>4:</b> <b>Make</b> <b>GNOME's</b> <b>"Lock"</b> <b>icon</b> <b>use</b> <b>XScreenSaver.</b>
              This used to work, but no longer does with GNOME 3.38.  If you figure it out, let me  know!   This
              still works for Cinnamon 4.8 and MATE 1.24:

                   sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/xscreensaver-command \
                          /usr/bin/gnome-screensaver-command
                   sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/xscreensaver-command \
                       /usr/bin/cinnamon-screensaver-command
                   sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/xscreensaver-command \
                           /usr/bin/mate-screensaver-command
                   sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/xscreensaver-command \
                          /usr/bin/xfce4-screensaver-command
                   sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/xscreensaver-command \
                               /usr/bin/light-locker-command

              This change will get blown away when you upgrade.

   <b>INSTALLING</b> <b>XSCREENSAVER</b> <b>ON</b> <b>KDE</b>
       Like  GNOME, KDE also decided to re-invent the wheel.  To replace the KDE screen saver with XScreenSaver,
       do the following:

           <b>1:</b> <b>Turn</b> <b>off</b> <b>KDE's</b> <b>built-in</b> <b>blanking.</b>
              In   <u>System</u>   <u>Settings</u>,   un-check   the   following   items,   as   these   are   controlled   by
              <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-settings.1.html">xscreensaver-settings</a></b>(1) now:

              "<u>Workspace</u> <u>Behavior</u> <u>/</u> <u>Screen</u> <u>Locking</u> <u>/</u> <u>Lock</u> <u>automatically</u>"
              "<u>Workspace</u> <u>Behavior</u> <u>/</u> <u>Screen</u> <u>Locking</u> <u>/</u> <u>After</u> <u>waking</u> <u>from</u> <u>sleep</u>"
              "<u>Workspace</u> <u>Behavior</u> <u>/</u> <u>Screen</u> <u>Locking</u> <u>/</u> <u>Keyboard</u> <u>shortcut</u>"
              "<u>Hardware</u> <u>/</u> <u>Power</u> <u>Management</u> <u>/</u> <u>Screen</u> <u>Energy</u> <u>Saving</u>"
              "<u>Hardware</u> <u>/</u> <u>Power</u> <u>Management</u> <u>/</u> <u>Suspend</u> <u>session</u>"
              "<u>Hardware</u> <u>/</u> <u>Power</u> <u>Management</u> <u>/</u> <u>Laptop</u> <u>lid</u> <u>closed"</u> <u>=</u> <u>Do</u> <u>Nothing</u>

              If  there  are  multiple  tabs, you may need to change these settings on all three of them: "On AC
              power", "Battery" and "Low Battery".

           <b>2:</b> <b>Launch</b> <b>XScreenSaver</b> <b>at</b> <b>login.</b>
              Copy the file <u>/usr/share/applications/xscreensaver.desktop</u> into the directory <u><a href="file:~/.config/autostart/">~/.config/autostart/</a></u>

           <b>3:</b> <b>Make</b> <b>KDE's</b> <b>"Lock"</b> <b>icon</b> <b>use</b> <b>XScreenSaver.</b>
              Find the "<u>kscreenlocker_greet</u>" program.  It might be in  "<u><a href="file:/usr/lib/">/usr/lib/</a>*/libexec/</u>",  or  it  might  be
              somewhere  else.  Delete that file and replace it with a file containing these two lines.  Make it
              executable (chmod a+x).

                   #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
                   xscreensaver-command --lock &amp;

              This change will get blown away when you upgrade.

           <b>4:</b> <b>Turn</b> <b>off</b> <b>KDE's</b> <b>built-in</b> <b>locking</b> <b>on</b> <b>suspend,</b> <b>even</b> <b>harder.</b>
              Even after disabling KDE's screen locking, above, it is <u>possible</u>  that  KDE  will  still  use  its
              built-in locker when you close your laptop's lid.  If that is happening, double-check the settings
              above,  but  if  those  are correct, try the following.  First, ensure you are running KDE 5.21 or
              newer.  Next, enable <u>"systemd</u> <u>user</u> <u>sessions"</u> for KDE so that  you  can  edit  the  parameters  for
              <u>ksmserver:</u>

                   kwriteconfig5 --file startkderc --group General \
                     --key systemdBoot true

              Log out and back in.

              Next, edit the <u>plasma-ksmserver</u> service to change how <u>ksmserver</u> is launched:

                   systemctl edit --user plasma-ksmserver.service

              Replace the contents of the file that lets you edit with this:

                   [Service]
                   ExecStart=
                   ExecStart=/usr/bin/ksmserver --no-lockscreen

              Then log out and back in <u>again</u>.

   <b>LAUNCHING</b> <b>XSCREENSAVER</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>LXDE</b>
       Add the line <u>@xscreensaver</u> to <u>/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart</u> or <u>/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart</u>.

   <b>LAUNCHING</b> <b>XSCREENSAVER</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>SYSTEMD</b>
       If you are not using GNOME, KDE or LXDE, the way to launch XScreenSaver at login is probably <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1).

       Copy  the  file  <u>/usr/share/xscreensaver/xscreensaver.service</u> into the directory <u><a href="file:~/.config/systemd/user/">~/.config/systemd/user/</a></u>.
       Create that directory first if it doesn't exist.  Then enable it with:

            systemctl --user enable xscreensaver

   <b>LAUNCHING</b> <b>XSCREENAVER</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>UPSTART</b>
       If you are not using GNOME, KDE or LXDE, and your system uses <b><a href="../man7/upstart.7.html">upstart</a></b>(7) instead  of  <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1),  launch
       the <u>"Startup</u> <u>Applications"</u> applet, click <u>"Add"</u>, and enter these lines:

            Name: XScreenSaver
            Command: xscreensaver
            Comment: XScreenSaver

   <b>LAPTOP</b> <b>LIDS</b> <b>WITHOUT</b> <b>SYSTEMD</b>
       BSD   systems   or   other   systems   without  <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1)  or  <b><a href="../man8/elogind.8.html">elogind</a></b>(8)  might  have  luck  by  adding
       "<u>xscreensaver-command</u>  <u>--suspend</u>"  to  some  appropriate  spot   in   <u>/etc/acpi/events/anything</u>   or   in
       <u>/etc/acpi/handler.sh</u>, if those files exist.

   <b>LAUNCHING</b> <b>XSCREENSAVER</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>GDM</b>
       You  can  run <u>xscreensaver</u> from your <b><a href="../man1/gdm.1.html">gdm</a></b>(1) session, so that the screensaver will run even when nobody is
       logged in on the console.  To do this, run <b><a href="../man1/gdmconfig.1.html">gdmconfig</a></b>(1).

       On the <u>General</u> page set the <u>Local</u> <u>Greeter</u> to <u>Standard</u> <u>Greeter</u>.

       On the <u>Background</u> page, type the command <u>"xscreensaver</u> <u>--no-splash"</u> into the  <u>Background</u>  <u>Program</u>  field.
       That  will  cause  gdm to run XScreenSaver while nobody is logged in, and kill it as soon as someone does
       log in.  (The user will then be responsible for starting XScreenSaver on their own, if they want.)

       If that doesn't work, you can edit the config file directly. Edit <u>/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf</u> to include:

            Greeter=/usr/bin/gdmlogin
            BackgroundProgram=xscreensaver --no-splash
            RunBackgroundProgramAlways=true

       In this situation, the <u>xscreensaver</u> process will be running as user <u>gdm</u>.  You can configure the  settings
       for this nobody-logged-in state (timeouts, DPMS, etc.) by editing the <u>~gdm/.xscreensaver</u> file.

       If  you get "connection refused" errors when running <u>xscreensaver</u> from <u>gdm</u>, then this probably means that
       you are having <b><a href="../man1/xauth.1.html">xauth</a></b>(1) problems.  For information on the X server's access control mechanisms,  see  the
       man pages for <b><a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/Xsecurity.1.html">Xsecurity</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/xauth.1.html">xauth</a></b>(1), and <b><a href="../man1/xhost.1.html">xhost</a></b>(1).

       There might be a way to accomplish this with other display managers.  It's a mystery!

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>WAYLAND</b> <b>PROBLEM</b></h4><pre>
       Wayland  is  a  completely  different  window system that is intended to replace X11.  After 14+ years of
       trying, some Linux distros have finally begun enabling it  by  default.   Most  deployments  of  it  also
       include XWayland, which is a compatibility layer that allows <u>some</u> X11 programs to continue to work within
       a Wayland environment.

       Unfortunately, XScreenSaver is not one of those programs.

       If your system is running XWayland, XScreenSaver will malfunction in two ways:

       <b>1:</b> It will be unable to detect user activity in non-X11 programs.

          This means that while a native Wayland program is selected, XScreenSaver will think that you are idle,
          and may blank the screen prematurely.

       <b>2:</b> It will be unable to lock the screen.

          This  is  because X11 grabs don't work properly under XWayland, so there is no way for XScreenSaver to
          prevent the user from switching away from the screen locker to another application.

       In short, for XScreenSaver to work properly, you will need to switch off Wayland and  use  the  X  Window
       System like in the "good old days".

   <b>TO</b> <b>DISABLE</b> <b>WAYLAND</b> <b>UNDER</b> <b>GNOME</b>
       The  login  screen  should  have a gear-icon menu that lets you change the session type from "GNOME" (the
       Wayland session) to "GNOME on Xorg" (the X11 session).

       Alternately, edit <u>/etc/gdm/custom.conf</u> and make sure it includes this line:

            WaylandEnable=false

   <b>TO</b> <b>DISABLE</b> <b>WAYLAND</b> <b>UNDER</b> <b>KDE</b>
       The login screen should have a menu that lets you change the session type to "Plasma (X11)".

       Alternately, edit <u>/etc/sddm.conf</u> and change the <u>SessionDir</u> line under the <u>[Wayland]</u> section to say:

            SessionDir=/dev/null

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b> <b>CONCERNS</b></h4><pre>
       XScreenSaver has a decades-long track record of securely locking your screen.  However,  there  are  many
       things  that  can  go  wrong.   X11  is  a very old system, and has a number of design flaws that make it
       susceptible to foot-shooting.

   <b>MAGIC</b> <b>BACKDOOR</b> <b>KEYSTROKES</b>
       The Xorg and XFree86 X servers, as well as the Linux kernel, both trap certain  magic  keystrokes  before
       X11 client programs ever see them.  If you care about keeping your screen locked, this is a big problem.

       <b>Ctrl+Alt+Backspace</b>
          This  keystroke  kills  the  X server, and on some systems, leaves you at a text console.  If the user
          launched X11 manually, that text console will still be logged in.  To disable this keystroke  globally
          and permanently, you need to set the <b>DontZap</b> flag in your <b><a href="../man5/xorg.conf.5.html">xorg.conf</a></b>(5) or <b><a href="../man5/XF86Config.5.html">XF86Config</a></b>(5) file.

       <b>Ctrl-Alt-F1,</b> <b>Ctrl-Alt-F2,</b> <b>etc.</b>
          These  keystrokes  will  switch  to a different virtual console, while leaving the console that X11 is
          running on locked.  If you left a shell logged in on another virtual console, it is  unprotected.   So
          don't  leave  yourself  logged  in  on  other  consoles.   You  can  disable VT switching globally and
          permanently by setting <b>DontVTSwitch</b> in your <b><a href="../man5/xorg.conf.5.html">xorg.conf</a></b>(5), but that might make your  system  harder  to
          use, since VT switching is an actual useful feature.

          There is no way to disable VT switching only when the screen is locked.  It's all or nothing.

       <b>Ctrl-Alt-KP_Multiply</b>
          This  keystroke  kills any X11 app that holds a lock, so typing this will kill XScreenSaver and unlock
          the screen.  You can disable it by turning off <b>AllowClosedownGrabs</b> in <b><a href="../man5/xorg.conf.5.html">xorg.conf</a></b>(5).

       <b>Alt-SysRq-F</b>
          This is the Linux kernel "OOM-killer" keystroke.  It shoots down random long-running programs  of  its
          choosing, and so might target and kill XScreenSaver.  You can disable this keystroke globally with:

               echo 176 &gt; <a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq">/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq</a>

          There's  little  that  I  can  do  to  make  the screen locker be secure so long as the kernel and X11
          developers are <u>actively</u> working against security like this.  The strength of the lock  on  your  front
          door  doesn't  matter  much  so  long  as someone else in the house insists on leaving a key under the
          welcome mat.

   <b>THE</b> <b>OOM-KILLER</b>
       Even if you have disabled the <b>Alt-SysRq-F</b> OOM-killer keystroke, the  OOM-killer  might  still  decide  to
       assassinate  XScreenSaver  at random, which will unlock your screen.  If the <b><a href="../man6/xscreensaver-auth.6.html">xscreensaver-auth</a></b>(6) program
       is installed setuid, it attempts to tell the OOM-killer to leave the XScreenSaver daemon alone, but  that
       may or may not work.

       You would think that the OOM-killer would pick the process using the most memory, but most of the time it
       seems  to  pick  the  process  that  would be most comically inconvenient, such as your screen locker, or
       <b><a href="../man8/crond.8.html">crond</a></b>(8).  You can disable the OOM-killer entirely with:

       In addition to the kernel's OOM-killer, <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) has its own.  The included  <u>xscreensaver.service</u>  file
       attempts to evade it, but you may want to just turn it off anyway:

            sudo systemctl mask systemd-oomd

   <b>X</b> <b>SERVER</b> <b>ACCESS</b> <b>IS</b> <b>GAME</b> <b>OVER</b>
       X11's security model is all-or-nothing.  If a program can connect to your X server at all, either locally
       or  over  the network, it can log all of your keystrokes, simulate keystrokes, launch arbitrary programs,
       and change the settings of other programs.  Assume that anything that can connect to your  X  server  can
       execute arbitrary code as the logged-in user.  See <b><a href="../man1/Xsecurity.1.html">Xsecurity</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/xauth.1.html">xauth</a></b>(1).

   <b>PAM</b> <b>PASSWORDS</b>
       If your system uses PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules), then PAM must be configured for XScreenSaver.
       If  it  is  not,  then you <u>might</u> be in a situation where you can't unlock.  Probably the file you need is
       <u>/etc/pam.d/xscreensaver</u>.

   <b>DON'T</b> <b>LOG</b> <b>IN</b> <b>AS</b> <b>ROOT</b>
       Never log in as root.  Log in as a normal user and use <b><a href="../man1/sudo.1.html">sudo</a></b>(1) as necessary.  If you  are  logged  in  as
       root, XScreenSaver will not lock your screen or run display modes, for numerous good and proper reasons.

</pre><h4><b>MULTI-USER</b> <b>OR</b> <b>SITE-WIDE</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       For a single user, the proper way to configure XScreenSaver is to simply run the <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-settings.1.html">xscreensaver-settings</a></b>(1)
       program, and change the settings through the GUI.  Changes are written to the <u><a href="file:~/.xscreensaver">~/.xscreensaver</a></u> file.

       If  you  want to set the system-wide defaults, then make your edits to <u>/etc/X11/app-defaults/XScreenSaver</u>
       instead.  The two files have similar (but not identical) syntax.

       You can also make changes via the X Resource Database and <b><a href="../man1/xrdb.1.html">xrdb</a></b>(1), but that can be very confusing and  is
       not really recommended.

       Options in <u><a href="file:~/.xscreensaver">~/.xscreensaver</a></u> override any settings in the resource database or app-defaults file.

       If  you  change a setting in the <u>.xscreensaver</u> file while XScreenSaver is already running, it will notice
       this, and reload the file as needed.  But if you change a setting in the X Resource  Database,  you  will
       need to restart XScreenSaver for those changes to take effect:

            xrdb &lt; <a href="file:~/.Xdefaults">~/.Xdefaults</a>
            xscreensaver-command --restart

</pre><h4><b>X</b> <b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       These are the X resources use by XScreenSaver program.  You probably won't need to change these manually:
       that's what the <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-settings.1.html">xscreensaver-settings</a></b>(1) program is for.

       <b>timeout</b> (class <b>Time</b>)
               The  screensaver will activate (blank the screen) after the keyboard and mouse have been idle for
               this many minutes.  Default 10 minutes.

       <b>cycle</b> (class <b>Time</b>)
               After the screensaver has been running for this many minutes, the currently running graphics-hack
               sub-process will be killed (with <b>SIGTERM</b>), and a new  one  started.   If  this  is  0,  then  the
               graphics  hack will never be changed: only one demo will run until the screensaver is deactivated
               by user activity.  Default 10 minutes.

               If there are multiple screens, the savers are staggered slightly so that while  they  all  change
               every <u>cycle</u> minutes, they don't all change at the same time.

       <b>lock</b> (class <b>Boolean</b>)
               Enable locking: before the screensaver will turn off, it will require you to type the password of
               the logged-in user.

       <b>lockTimeout</b> (class <b>Time</b>)
               If  locking  is  enabled,  this  controls  the  length  of  the  "grace  period" between when the
               screensaver activates, and when the screen becomes locked.   For  example,  if  this  is  5,  and
               <u>timeout</u>  is  10, then after 10 minutes, the screen would blank.  If there was user activity at 12
               minutes, no password would be required to un-blank the screen.  But, if there was  user  activity
               at  15  minutes or later (that is, <u>lockTimeout</u> minutes after activation) then a password would be
               required.  The default is 0, meaning that if locking is enabled, then a password will be required
               as soon as the screen blanks.

       <b>passwdTimeout</b> (class <b>Time</b>)
               If the screen is locked, then this is how many seconds the password dialog box should be left  on
               the  screen  before giving up (default 30 seconds).  A few seconds are added each time you type a
               character.

       <b>dpmsEnabled</b> (class <b>Boolean</b>)
               Whether power management is enabled.

       <b>dpmsStandby</b> (class <b>Time</b>)
               If power management is enabled, how long until the monitor goes solid black.

       <b>dpmsSuspend</b> (class <b>Time</b>)
               If power management is enabled, how long until the monitor goes into power-saving mode.

       <b>dpmsOff</b> (class <b>Time</b>)
               If power management is enabled, how long until the monitor powers  down  completely.   Note  that
               these  settings  will  have  no  effect unless both the X server and the display hardware support
               power management; not all do.  See the <u>Power</u> <u>Management</u> section, below, for more information.

       <b>dpmsQuickOff</b> (class <b>Boolean</b>)
               If <u>mode</u> is <u>blank</u> and this is true,  then  the  screen  will  be  powered  down  immediately  upon
               blanking, regardless of other power-management settings.

       <b>verbose</b> (class <b>Boolean</b>)
               Whether to print diagnostics.  Default false.

       <b>splash</b> (class <b>Boolean</b>)
               Whether to display a splash screen at startup.  Default true.

       <b>splashDuration</b> (class <b>Time</b>)
               How long the splash screen should remain visible; default 5 seconds.

       <b>helpURL</b> (class <b>URL</b>)
               The  splash  screen  has  a  <u>Help</u>  button on it.  When you press it, it will display the web page
               indicated here in your web browser.

       <b>loadURL</b> (class <b>LoadURL</b>)
               This is the shell command used to load a URL into your web browser.

       <b>demoCommand</b> (class <b>DemoCommand</b>)
               This is the shell command run when the <u>Demo</u> button on the splash window is pressed.  It  defaults
               to <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-settings.1.html">xscreensaver-settings</a></b>(1).

       <b>newLoginCommand</b> (class <b>NewLoginCommand</b>)
               If  set,  this  is  the  shell  command that is run when the "New Login" button is pressed on the
               unlock dialog box, in order to create a new desktop session without logging out the user who  has
               locked  the screen.  Typically this will be some variant of <b><a href="../man1/gdmflexiserver.1.html">gdmflexiserver</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/kdmctl.1.html">kdmctl</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/lxdm.1.html">lxdm</a></b>(1)
               or <b><a href="../man1/dm-tool.1.html">dm-tool</a></b>(1).

       <b>nice</b> (class <b>Nice</b>)
               The sub-processes launched by XScreenSaver will be "niced" to this level, so that they are  given
               lower  priority  than  other  processes on the system, and don't increase the load unnecessarily.
               The default is 10.  (Higher numbers mean lower priority; see <b><a href="../man1/nice.1.html">nice</a></b>(1) for details.)

       <b>fade</b> (class <b>Boolean</b>)
               If this is true, then when the screensaver activates, the desktop will fade to black  instead  of
               simply winking out.  Default: true.

       <b>unfade</b> (class <b>Boolean</b>)
               If  this  is  true,  then  when  the screensaver deactivates, desktop will fade back ininstead of
               appearing immediately.  This is only done if <u>fade</u> is true as well.  Default: true.

       <b>fadeSeconds</b> (class <b>Time</b>)
               If <u>fade</u> is true, this is how long the fade will be in seconds. Default 3 seconds.

       <b>ignoreUninstalledPrograms</b> (class <b>Boolean</b>)
               There may be programs in the list that are not  installed  on  the  system,  yet  are  marked  as
               "enabled".   If  this  preference  is true, then such programs will simply be ignored.  If false,
               then a warning will be printed if an attempt is made to run the nonexistent program.   Also,  the
               <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-settings.1.html">xscreensaver-settings</a></b>(1) program will suppress the non-existent programs from the list if this is
               true.  Default: false.

       <b>authWarningSlack</b> (class <b>Integer</b>)
               After  you  successfully  unlock the screen, a dialog may pop up informing you of previous failed
               login attempts.  If all of those login attemps were within this amount of time, they are ignored.
               The assumption is that incorrect passwords entered within a few seconds of a correct one are user
               error, rather than hostile action.  Default 20 seconds.

       <b>mode</b> (class <b>Mode</b>)
               Controls the screen-saving behavior.  Valid values are:

               <b>random</b>  When blanking the screen, select a random display mode from among those that are  enabled
                       and applicable.  This is the default.

               <b>random-same</b>
                       Like  <u>random</u>,  but  if  there  are multiple screens, each screen will run the <u>same</u> random
                       display mode, instead of each screen running a different one.

               <b>one</b>     When blanking the screen, only ever use one particular display mode (the one indicated by
                       the <u>selected</u> setting).

               <b>blank</b>   When blanking the screen, just go black: don't run any graphics hacks.

               <b>off</b>     Don't ever blank the screen, and don't ever allow the monitor to power down.

       <b>selected</b> (class <b>Integer</b>)
               When <u>mode</u> is set to <u>one</u>, this is the one, indicated by its index in the  <u>programs</u>  list.   You're
               crazy if you count them and set this number by hand: let <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-settings.1.html">xscreensaver-settings</a></b>(1) do it for you!

       <b>programs</b> (class <b>Programs</b>)
               The  graphics hacks which XScreenSaver runs when the user is idle.  The value of this resource is
               a multi-line string, one <u>sh</u>-syntax command per line.  Each line must contain exactly one command:
               no semicolons, no ampersands.

               When the screensaver starts up, one of these is selected (according to  the  <b>mode</b>  setting),  and
               run.  After the <u>cycle</u> period expires, it is killed, and another is selected and run.

               If  a  line begins with a dash (-) then that particular program is disabled: it won't be selected
               at random (though you can still select it explicitly using the <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-settings.1.html">xscreensaver-settings</a></b>(1) program).

               If all programs are disabled, then the screen will just be made blank, as when  <u>mode</u>  is  set  to
               <u>blank</u>.

               To  disable  a  program, you must mark it as disabled with a dash instead of removing it from the
               list.  This is because the system-wide (app-defaults) and per-user (.xscreensaver)  settings  are
               merged  together,  and  if  a user just <u>deletes</u> an entry from their programs list, but that entry
               still exists in the system-wide list, then it will come back.  However, if the user <u>disables</u>  it,
               then their setting takes precedence.

               The  default  XScreenSaver hacks directory (typically <u>/usr/libexec/xscreensaver/</u>) is prepended to
               <b>$PATH</b> before searching for these programs.

               To use a program as a screensaver, it must be able to render onto the window provided  to  it  in
               the <b>$XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW</b> environment variable.  If it creates and maps its own window instead, it
               won't work.  It must render onto the provided window.

               <b>Visuals:</b>

               Because  XScreenSaver was created back when dinosaurs roamed the earth, it still contains support
               for some things you've  probably  never  seen,  such  as  1-bit  monochrome  monitors,  grayscale
               monitors, and monitors capable of displaying only 8-bit colormapped images.

               If  there are some programs that you want to run only when using a color display, and others that
               you want to run only when using a monochrome display, you can specify that like this:

                    mono:   mono-program  -root        \n\
                    color:  color-program -root        \n\

               More generally, you can specify the kind of visual that should be used for the  window  on  which
               the  program  will  be drawing.  For example, if one program works best if it has a colormap, but
               another works best if it has a 24-bit visual, both can be accommodated:

                    PseudoColor: cmap-program  -root   \n\
                    TrueColor:   24bit-program -root   \n\

               In addition to the symbolic visual names described above  (in  the  discussion  of  the  <u>visualID</u>
               resource) one other visual name is supported in the <u>programs</u> list:

        <b>default-n</b>
            This  is  like  <b>default</b>,  but  also  requests  the use of the default colormap, instead of a private
            colormap.

       If you specify a particular visual for a program, and that visual does not exist on the screen, then that
       program will not be chosen to run.  This means that  on  displays  with  multiple  screens  of  different
       depths, you can arrange for appropriate hacks to be run on each.  For example, if one screen is color and
       the other is monochrome, hacks that look good in mono can be run on one, and hacks that only look good in
       color will show up on the other.

       <b>visualID</b> (class <b>VisualID</b>)
               This  is an historical artifact left over from when 8-bit displays were still common.  You should
               probably ignore this.

               Specify which X visual to use by default.  (Note carefully that this resource is called <b>visualID</b>,
               not merely <b>visual</b>; if you set the <b>visual</b> resource instead, things  will  malfunction  in  obscure
               ways for obscure reasons.)

               Valid values for the <b>VisualID</b> resource are:

               <b>default</b> Use the screen's default visual (the visual of the root window).  This is the default.

               <b>best</b>    Use  the  visual which supports the most colors.  Note, however, that the visual with the
                       most colors might be a TrueColor visual, which does not support colormap animation.  Some
                       programs have  more  interesting  behavior  when  run  on  PseudoColor  visuals  than  on
                       TrueColor.

               <b>mono</b>    Use a monochrome visual, if there is one.

               <b>gray</b>    Use  a  grayscale  or  staticgray  visual, if there is one and it has more than one plane
                       (that is, it's not monochrome).

               <b>color</b>   Use the best of the color visuals, if there are any.

               <b>GL</b>      Use the visual that  is  best  for  OpenGL  programs.   (OpenGL  programs  have  somewhat
                       different requirements than other X programs.)

               <u>class</u>   where  <u>class</u>  is  one  of  <b>StaticGray</b>, <b>StaticColor</b>, <b>TrueColor</b>, <b>GrayScale</b>, <b>PseudoColor</b>, or
                       <b>DirectColor</b>.  Selects the deepest visual of the given class.

               <u>N</u>       where <u>number</u> (decimal or hex) is interpreted as a visual id number, as  reported  by  the
                       <b><a href="../man1/xdpyinfo.1.html">xdpyinfo</a></b>(1)  program;  in  this  way you can have finer control over exactly which visual
                       gets used, for example, to select a shallower one than would otherwise have been chosen.

               Note that this option specifies only the <u>default</u> visual that will be used: the visual used may be
               overridden on a program-by-program basis.  See the description of the <b>programs</b> resource, above.

       <b>installColormap</b> (class <b>Boolean</b>)
               This is an historical artifact left  over  from  when  8-bit  displays  were  still  common.   On
               PseudoColor (8-bit) displays, install a private colormap while the screensaver is active, so that
               the  graphics hacks can get as many colors as possible.  This is the default.  (This only applies
               when the screen's default visual is being used, since non-default visuals get their own colormaps
               automatically.)  This can also be overridden on a per-hack  basis:  see  the  discussion  of  the
               <b>default-n</b> name in the section about the <b>programs</b> resource.

               This  does  nothing if you have a TrueColor (16-bit or deeper) display.  (Which, in this century,
               you do.)

       <b>pointerHysteresis</b> (class <b>Integer</b>)
               If the mouse moves less than this-many pixels in a second, ignore it (do not consider that to  be
               "activity").   This  is  so  that the screen doesn't un-blank (or fail to blank) just because you
               bumped the desk.  Default: 10 pixels.

               A single pixel of motion will still cause the monitor to power back on, but not un-blank. This is
               because the X11 server itself unfortunately handles power-management-related  activity  detection
               rather than XScreenSaver.
