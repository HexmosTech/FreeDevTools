</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Jack - rip and encode CDs with one command

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jack</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Jack</b> transforms your audio-CDs to FLAC, MP3 or Ogg Vorbis files. It uses several helper programs in order
       to  achieve  things  like  ripping,  encoding and ID3-tagging.  Ripping is either done via <b>cdparanoia</b> (in
       which case the ripping status is displayed by Jack  as  well)  or  <b>cdda2wav.</b>   Jack  works  with  several
       encoders,  namely  <b>oggenc,</b> <b>flac,</b> <b>lame,</b> <b>gogo,</b> <b>bladeenc,</b> <b>l3enc,</b> <b>mp3enc</b> and <b>xing.</b>  Any time during operation
       (and even when everything is finished and the original CD lost) you can let Jack look up the track  names
       at  <b>freedb.org</b> and rename the tracks accordingly. ID3-tagging of MP3s (or insertion of equivalent comment
       fields in Ogg Vorbis files) is performed as well.

       If no freedb-lookup has been performed, Jack drops all files in a  directory  <b><a href="file:~/jack/jack-xxxxxxxx">~/jack/jack-xxxxxxxx</a></b>,  with
       <b>xxxxxxxx</b>  representing  the  CD's  CDDB/FreeDB  disc  ID.   This  directory  is  renamed by Jack when the
       appropriate information is known.

       Most options like ripper, encoder, preferred FreeDB-Server, directory and MP3-filename format,  etc.  can
       be user defined by changing the defaults in <b>/etc/jackrc</b> or by saving them to <b><a href="file:~/.jack3rc">~/.jack3rc</a></b>.

       While Jack is running, these keyboard commands are available:

              <b>q</b> or <b>Q</b> quit

              <b>p</b> or <b>P</b> disable ripping (for example, if you need the CD drive)

              <b>p</b> or <b>P</b> (again) or <b>c</b> or <b>C</b>
                     resume ripping

              <b>e</b> or <b>E</b> pause/continue all encoders

              <b>r</b> or <b>R</b> pause/continue all rippers.

              <b>?</b>      toggle the copyright/help box

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Different options need different data-types as arguments:

       <b>bool</b>   can be "yes" or "no", like in <b>--vbr=yes</b>

       <b>string</b> can be anything, like in <b>--rename-fmt</b> "%n.%t"

       <b>int</b>    an integer number, like in <b>--bitrate</b> <b>192</b> (or <b>--bitrate=192</b> )

       <b>list</b>   multiple  strings,  delimited  by  the  final  ";".   Example: <b>--guess-toc</b> <b>file1.mp3</b> <b>file2.mp3</b> <b>...</b>
              <b>fileN.mp3</b> \;

       Jack understands the following options:

       <b>--append-year=bool</b>
              if known, append the year to dir in the format " (%y)"

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--bitrate</b> <b>int</b>
              target bitrate (in kbit/s, default is 160).

       <b>--char-filter</b> <b>string</b>
              convert file names using a python method

       <b>--charset</b> <b>string</b>
              charset of filenames (defaults to your locale).

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--check-toc</b>
              compare toc-file and cd-toc, then exit. Jack caches the TOC of a CD in a file ("jack.toc"). If you
              want to know if the inserted CD matches the toc-file in the current directory, use this option.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--claim-dir</b>
              rename directories even if they were was not created by Jack.

       <b>--cont-failed-query</b>
              continue without FreeDB data if query fails.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--create-dirs</b>
              tells Jack to create sub-directories in which Jack puts all the files for the current  CD.  If  no
              FreeDB  data  is  available,  i.e.   when  not  using  <b>-Q</b> , these directories will be named "jack-
              xxxxxxxx" where "xxxxxxxx" stands for the CD's FreeDB ID. Otherwise dir_template (see above)  will
              be used. This option is turned on by default.

       <b>--device</b> <b>string</b>
              The device-name of your cdrom-drive. The default is <b>/dev/cdrom</b>

       <b>--dir-template</b> <b>string</b>
              if directories are renamed, this is the format used (default "%a/%l")

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--dont-work</b>
              don't  do  DAE,  encoding, tagging or renaming. This may be useful if you only want to do a FreeDB
              query, e.g. while another jack is running.

       <b>--edit-freedb</b>
              open an editor to change the CDDB information which has been obtained previously (only useful with
              -Q).

       <b>--encoder-name,</b> <b>-E</b> <b>string</b>
              use which encoder (default "oggenc")

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--encoders</b> <b>int</b>
              encode how many files in parallel. If you have a SMP machine or simply want to stress your system,
              you can have Jack encode several files at once.

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--exec</b>
              run predefined command when finished.

       <b>--extt-is-artist</b>
              the artist is contained in the EXTT fields. The EXTT fields are lines in  the  FreeDB  file  which
              contain additional data for each track. As it's the submitting user's choice what to use them for,
              Jack can't determine by itself what they were intended for. You have to provide this information.

       <b>--extt-is-title</b>
              the track title is contained in the EXTT fields.

       <b>--extt-is-comment</b>
              a track comment is contained in the EXTT fields.

       <b>--force</b>
              do not ask. Like when deleting incomplete files.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--from-tocfile</b> <b>string</b>
              rip  from  a  cdrdao created CD image on hd. The specified toc-file contains the name of the image
              file. Use <b>-F</b> if jack can't find the image file.

       <b>-F,</b> <b>--from-image</b> <b>string</b>
              read audio data from image file. Like <b>--from-tocfile</b>, but the image itself is specified instead of
              the tocfile. If you do not have a toc-file (or don't specify a toc-file), the TOC is read from the
              CD itself.

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--guess-toc</b> <b>list</b>
              make up a TOC from the MP3 file given in mp3_files. Format is <b>track_01.mp3</b> <b>...</b> <b>track_nn.mp3</b> <b>;</b> Note
              that the trailing " <b>;</b> " is only necessary if you want to append more options to your command line.
              You can use it to do a FreeDB query based on MP3s alone - no need for the CD. Very useful  if  you
              have  no idea which CD the MP3s are from. The MP3s must be given in the same order as they were on
              their CD. The generated TOC file is similar, but not identical to the TOC  of  the  CD  -  do  not
              submit these!

       <b>-G,</b> <b>--id3-genre</b> <b>string</b>
              set ID3 genre. Use 'help' to get a list of all known genres. (You can also specify the ID3v1 genre
              as an int)

       <b>-Y,</b> <b>--id3-year</b> <b>int</b>
              set ID3 year.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show summary of options.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--keep-wavs</b>
              do not delete WAVs after encoding them.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--mail-submit</b>
              submit FreeDB entry via e-mail. HTTP submission is preferred.  You will have to enter the category
              of the CD.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--max-load</b> <b>float</b>
              only start new encoders if your system's load is below the specified value.  <a href="file:/proc/loadavg">/proc/loadavg</a> must be
              readable by you for this to work.

       <b>--multi-mode</b>
              try to query FreeDB for all dirs in searchdirs which have no FreeDB data.

       <b>--my-mail</b> <b>string</b>
              your e-mail address, needed for FreeDB submissions.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--nice</b> <b>int</b>
              nice-level  with  which  the  encoders are started. Default is 12 which shouldn't hurt your system
              much.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--overwrite</b>
              overwrite existing files, i.e. do not check if already ripped WAVs or an already encoded file seem
              to be OK. Use this if you <b>know</b> something went wrong last time. This is off by default.

       <b>-O,</b> <b>--only-dae</b>
              only produce WAVs, implies <b>--keep-wavs.</b>  This is off by default.

       <b>--otf=bool</b>
              On-the-fly operation. Only on some encoders/rippers.  Do  not  create  WAVs,  pipe  ripper  output
              through the encoder. Default is no as it's a torture for the CDROM drive.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--overwrite=bool</b>
              overwrite existing files.

       <b>--quality</b> <b>int</b>
              vbr encoding quality. -1 is lowest, 10 highest (default 6). You can also specify a float.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--query</b>
              do  FreeDB  query  when  all  is  done. This is useful if Jack was previously run without a FreeDB
              query. If all tracks are done you don't even have to have a CD inserted as the TOC  is  cached  by
              Jack. After having finished ripping and encoding, Jack will rename the files and tag them.

       <b>--query-if-needed=bool</b>
              like --query-now, but only if FreeDB data hasn't been successfully queried before.

       <b>-Q,</b> <b>--query-now</b>
              do  FreeDB  query when starting. Use this if you are connected to the Internet when starting Jack.
              Know that the query may need user-interaction. After having finished ripping  and  encoding,  Jack
              will rename the files and tag them.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--read-ahead</b> <b>int</b>
              read  how  many  WAVs in advance. At most read_ahead + num_encoders WAVs are ripped before a track
              has completely been encoded.  Default is 99 which will read the whole CD, provided there is enough
              disk space.

       <b>--remove-files</b>
              have Jack remove its temp jack*-files.  Be careful - don't delete them too early!

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--rename</b>
              rename and tag files according to FreeDB file. On startup, Jack creates a blank FreeDB entry  file
              (except  if  <b>--query-now</b>  is  used, then the file is queried from your FreeDB server). If you have
              changed its contents (e.g. because the CD was unknown to FreeDB) and want to rename and  tag  your
              MP3s accordingly, use this option.  Give all other needed options too, like <b>-t</b> , <b>-E</b> , ...

       <b>--rename-dir=bool</b>
              rename directory as well (default).

       <b>--rename-fmt</b> <b>string</b>
              format of normal files (default "%n - %t")

       <b>--rename-fmt-va</b> <b>string</b>
              format of Various Artists files (default "%n - %a - %t")

       <b>--rename-num</b> <b>string</b>
              format of the track number (%n, printf() style) used to rename the files (default "%02d")

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--reorder=bool</b>
              optimize  track-order  for  disk space. This can save you some peak disk space during the encoding
              process; this may make it possible to do a CD which would otherwise fail to be encoded.

       <b>--replacement-chars</b> <b>list</b>
              unusable chars are replaced by the corresponding list item (default "%").

       <b>--ripper</b> <b>string</b>
              which program to use for extracting the audio data (default "cdparanoia").

       <b>--save</b> save options to <u><a href="file:~/.jack3rc">~/.jack3rc</a></u> file and exit.

       <b>--scan-dirs</b> <b>int</b>
              Scan this many levels from the current working directory for a matching toc-file  (0  to  disable,
              default 2).

       <b>--search</b> <b>list</b>
              add  these  directories  to the list of directories searched when looking for the workdir (default
              ".").

       <b>--server</b> <b>string</b>
              which FreeDB server to use. Don't forget to  set  your  HTTP  proxy.   Currently  either  "freedb"
              (default) or "freedb-de".

       <b>--silent-mode=bool</b>
              be quiet (no screen output).

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--space</b> <b>int</b>
              forcibly  set  usable  disk  space, in bytes. This option lets you limit the disk space Jack uses,
              maybe you need it for something else? Be careful: if set too high or too low, ripping and encoding
              will probably fail. The default is to look how much is free and to use this value.

       <b>--submit</b>
              submit FreeDB entry via HTTP. You will have to enter the category of the CD.

       <b>-S,</b> <b>--swab=bool</b>
              swap byte order from image file. As cdrdao momentarily only outputs "raw" .cdr  files,  you  quite
              likely  want  to  swap the byte order. Try this option if your WAVs and encoded files contain only
              noise.  This is on by default as cdrdao currently generates .cdr files that are "wrong".

       <b>--todo</b> print what would be done and exit.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--tracks</b> <b>string</b>
              limit ripping and encoding to the specified tracks, use comma to separate tracks. Ranges are  also
              possible;  5-9  is  equivalent  to  5,6,7,8,9; 12- is like specifying track 12,...,last_track. The
              default is to process the whole CD.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--undo-rename</b>
              undo file renaming and exit. If you don't like how Jack renamed your files,  use  this  option  to
              restore  the  previous  state.   Several  levels  of undo are possible. Note that ID3 tags are not
              restored.

       <b>--unusable-chars</b> <b>list</b>
              characters which can't be used in filenames (default "/").

       <b>--upd-progress</b>
              have Jack re-create its temp files. Use this if you deleted them too early.

       <b>--update-freedb,</b> <b>-U</b>
              update the FreeDB info and exit.

       <b>--usage-win=bool</b>
              show the help screen while running.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--vbr=bool</b>
              Generate variable bitrate files, only on encoders which support this. Default is no.

       <b>--various=bool</b>
              when parsing FreeDB data, Jack assumes that if the disc´s artist is set  to  "Various"  the  track
              titles  have  the  format "[artist] - [title]". If the disc title is set to something else and you
              still want the above behaviour, use <b>--various.</b>

       <b>--various-swap</b>
              exchange artist and title, many FreeDB entries have them wrong.

       <b>--wait=bool</b>
              wait for key press before quitting.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--workdir</b> <b>string</b>
              where to create directories and put the files.

       <b>--write-id3v1=bool</b>
              write a smart id3v1 tag to the encoded file.

       <b>--write-id3v2=bool</b>
              write an id3v2 tag to the encoded file.

       <b>--write-m3u</b>
              create a playlist in .m3u format. This has bugs, don't rely on it.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Insert a CD, fire up jack:
              jack

       Now watch it work. It's fun for a while. After having finished, you have the following files on your  HD:
       track_01.mp3,  track_02.mp3,  ..., track_nn.mp3 plus jack.toc, jack.freedb, jack.progress. The last three
       are used to store the state jack is in so it can resume work when interrupted.

       Jack will create a directory called jack-xxxxxxxx for you, there it stores all the file for the CD  whose
       id  is xxxxxxxx. After a FreeDB query this directory is renamed to something human readable, like "Artist
       - Title".

       When jack is interrupted, call it again using the same command line as before to  resume  work,  in  this
       case
              jack

       Now let's try a FreeDB query:
              jack -q
       If  the  query  is  successful  the  files  will be renamed to something more readable and will be tagged
       accordingly using ID3 or Vorbis tags.  The file jack.freedb will contain the queried  FreeDB  entry,  and
       the original file will be backed up as jack.freedb.bak.

       You  can  use  the  <b>--rename-fmt</b> option in order to specify the format of the name which will be given to
       your audio tracks.  A list of valid options can be found below.  You may also want to specify  a  set  of
       characters  which  are  not  usable  and  should be replaced.  For example, on Unix systems the slash <b>(/)</b>
       should most certainly be replaced with something else.  The VFAT filesystem also does not support  double
       quotes  <b>(").</b>   In  order  to replace such characters, you can specify the options <b>unusable_chars</b> together
       with <b>replacement_chars.</b>  For example,
              jack -Q --rename-fmt "%n-%t" --unusable-chars A I ; --replacement-chars a i ;
       will query the FreeDB server, rip and encode all tracks of the CD and save the files in  a  format  which
       will  contain  the  track  number and the title.  All occurrences of the letters <b>A</b> and <b>I</b> will be replaced
       with their lower-case versions.  These options can also be put in  one's  configuration  file  using  the
       following format:
              unusable_chars:[' ', '/']
              replacement_chars:['_', '_']
       This  will  replace  whitespace  and  slashes with underscores.  If you want to convert all characters to
       lower-case, you don't have to manually specify all of them but can use the following option instead:
              char_filter:.lower()

       All in one: query, rip, encode, cleanup:
              jack -Q --remove-files

       Editing / normalizing / stripping the WAV files before encoding:
              jack -O --remove-files ; gnoise *wav ; jack -g *wav ; jack
       Just replace gnoise by the operation you'd like to perform.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       There are several environment variables which can be used in jack's exec hooks:

       JACK_BASE_DIR
              lists jack's base directory in which files are stored.

       JACK_CUR_DIR
              lists the current directory of jack in which files of the current album are put.

       JACK_JUST_ENCODED
              lists all track names which have just been encoded.

       JACK_JUST_RIPPED
              lists all track names which have just been ripped.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b> <b>STRINGS</b></h4><pre>
       %n     Track number

       %a     Artist

       %t     Track title

       %l     Album title

       %y     Album release year

       %g     Album genre
