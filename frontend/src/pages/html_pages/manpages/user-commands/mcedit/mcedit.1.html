</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mcedit - Internal file editor of GNU Midnight Commander.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mcedit</b> [-bcCdfhstVx?] [+lineno] [file1] [file2] ...

       <b>mcedit</b> [-bcCdfhstVx?] file1:lineno[:] file2:lineno[:] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       mcedit  is  a  link  to  <b>mc</b>, the main GNU Midnight Commander executable. Executing GNU Midnight Commander
       under this name runs the internal editor and opens files specified on the command  line.  The  editor  is
       based on the terminal version of <b>cooledit</b> - standalone editor for X Window System.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>+lineno</u>
              Go to the line specified by number (do not put a space between the <u>+</u> sign and the number). Several
              line  numbers  are allowed but only the last one will be used, and it will be applied to the first
              file only.

       <u>-b</u>     Force black and white display.

       <u>-c</u>     Force ANSI color mode on terminals that don't seem to have color support.

       <u>-C</u> <u>&lt;keyword&gt;=&lt;fgcolor&gt;,&lt;bgcolor&gt;,&lt;attributes&gt;:&lt;keyword&gt;=</u> <u>...</u>
              Specify a different color set.  See the <b>Colors</b> section in <a href="../man1/mc.1.html">mc</a>(1) for more information.

       <u>-d</u>     Disable mouse support.

       <u>-f</u>     Display the compiled-in search path for GNU Midnight Commander data files.

       <u>-t</u>     Force using termcap database instead of terminfo.  This option is only applicable if GNU  Midnight
              Commander was compiled with S-Lang library with terminfo support.

       <u>-V</u>     Display the version of the program.

       <u>-x</u>     Force  xterm  mode.   Used  when running on xterm-capable terminals (two screen modes, and able to
              send mouse escape sequences).

</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       The internal file editor is a full-featured windowed editor.  It can edit several files at the same time.
       Maximum size of each file is 64 megabytes. It is possible to edit binary files. The features it presently
       supports are: block copy, move, delete, cut, paste; key for key undo; pull-down  menus;  file  insertion;
       macro commands; regular expression search and replace; shift-arrow text highlighting (if supported by the
       terminal);  insert-overwrite  toggle;  autoindent; tunable tab size; syntax highlighting for various file
       types; and an option to pipe text blocks through shell commands like indent and ispell.

       Each file is opened in its own window in full-screen mode. Window control in mcedit  is  similar  to  the
       window  control  in  other  multi-window  program:  double  click on window title maximizes the window to
       full-screen or restores window size and position; left-click on window title and  mouse  drag  moves  the
       window  in  editor  area;  left-click  on low-right frame corner and mouse drag resizes the window. These
       actions can be made using "Window" menu.

</pre><h4><b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       The editor is easy to use and can be used without learning.  The pull-down menu is  invoked  by  pressing
       F9.  You can learn other keys from the menu and from the button bar labels.

       In  addition  to  that, Shift combined with arrows does text highlighting (if supported by the terminal):
       <b>Ctrl-Ins</b>    copies    to    the    file    <b><a href="file:~/.cache/mc/mcedit/mcedit.clip">~/.cache/mc/mcedit/mcedit.clip</a></b>,    <b>Shift-Ins</b>    pastes    from
       <b><a href="file:~/.cache/mc/mcedit/mcedit.clip">~/.cache/mc/mcedit/mcedit.clip</a></b>,  <b>Shift-Del</b>  cuts  to <b><a href="file:~/.cache/mc/mcedit/mcedit.clip">~/.cache/mc/mcedit/mcedit.clip</a></b>, and <b>Ctrl-Del</b> deletes
       highlighted text.  Mouse highlighting also works on some terminals.  To use the  standard  mouse  support
       provided  by  your  terminal,  hold  the  Shift  key.  Please note that the mouse support in the terminal
       doesn't share the clipboard with <b>mcedit</b>.

       The completion key (usually <b>Meta-Tab</b> or <b>Escape</b> <b>Tab</b>) completes the word under the cursor using  the  words
       used in the file.

</pre><h4><b>MACRO</b></h4><pre>
       To  define  a macro, press <b>Ctrl-R</b> and then type out the keys you want to be executed.  Press <b>Ctrl-R</b> again
       when finished.  The macro can be assigned to any key by pressing that key.  The macro  is  executed  when
       you press the assigned key.

       The macro commands are stored in section <b>[editor]</b> it the file <b><a href="file:~/.local/share/mc/mc.macros">~/.local/share/mc/mc.macros</a></b>.

       External scripts (filters) can be assigned into the any hotkey by edit <b>mc.macros</b> like following:

       [editor]
       ctrl-W=ExecuteScript:25;

       This means that ctrl-W hotkey initiates the <u><a href="../man25/ExecuteScript.25.html">ExecuteScript</a>(25)</u> action, then editor handler translates this
       into execution of <b><a href="file:~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/macros.d/macro.25.sh">~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/macros.d/macro.25.sh</a></b> shell script.

       External  scripts  are  stored  in  <b><a href="file:~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/macros.d/">~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/macros.d/</a></b>  directory  and  must  be named as
       <b>macro.XXXX.sh</b> where <b>XXXX</b> is the number from 0 to 9999.  See <b>Edit</b> <b>Menu</b> <b>File</b> for more detail  about  format
       of the script.

       Following macro definition and directives can be used:

       <u>#silent</u>
              If this directive is set, then script starts without interactive subshell.

       <u>%c</u>     The cursor column position number.

       <u>%i</u>     The indent of blank space, equal the cursor column.

       <u>%y</u>     The syntax type of current file.

       <u>%b</u>     The block file name.

       <u>%f</u>     The current file name.

       <u>%n</u>     Only the current file name without extension.

       <u>%x</u>     The extension of current file name.

       <u>%d</u>     The current directory name.

       <u>%F</u>     The current file in the unselected panel.

       <u>%D</u>     The directory name of the unselected panel.

       <u>%t</u>     The currently tagged files.

       <u>%T</u>     The tagged files in the unselected panel.

       <u>%u</u> and <u>%U</u>
              Similar  to  the  <u>%t</u> and <u>%T</u> macros, but in addition the files are untagged. You can use this macro
              only once per menu file entry or extension file entry, because next time there will be  no  tagged
              files.

       <u>%s</u> and <u>%S</u>
              The selected files: The tagged files if there are any. Otherwise the current file.

       Feel free to edit this files, if you need.  Here is a sample external script:

       l       comment selection
            TMPFILE=`mktemp ${MC_TMPDIR:-<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>}/up.XXXXXX` || exit 1
            echo #if 0 &gt; $TMPFILE
            cat %b &gt;&gt; $TMPFILE
            echo #endif &gt;&gt; $TMPFILE
            cat $TMPFILE &gt; %b
            rm -f $TMPFILE

       If some keys don't work, you can use <b>Learn</b> <b>Keys</b> in the <b>Options</b> menu.

</pre><h4><b>CODE</b> <b>NAVIGATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mcedit</b>  can  be  used  for navigation through code with tags files created by etags or ctags commands. If
       there is no TAGS file code navigation will not work.  For example,  in  case  of  exuberant-ctags  for  C
       language command will be:

       ctags -e --language-force=C -R ./

       <b>Meta-Enter</b> shows list box to select item under cursor (cursor should stand at the end of the word).

       <b>Meta-Minus</b>  where  minus  is symbol "-" goes to previous function in navigation list (like browser's Back
       button).

       <b>Meta-Equal</b> where equal is symbol "=" goes to next function in navigation  list  (like  browser's  Forward
       button).

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b> <b>HIGHLIGHTING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mcedit</b>  supports  syntax  highlighting.   This  means that keywords and contexts (like C comments, string
       constants, etc) are highlighted in different colors.  The following section explains the  format  of  the
       file  <b><a href="file:~/.local/share/mc/syntax/Syntax">~/.local/share/mc/syntax/Syntax</a></b>.   If this file is missing, system-wide <b>/usr/share/mc/syntax/Syntax</b>
       is used.  The file <b><a href="file:~/.local/share/mc/syntax/Syntax">~/.local/share/mc/syntax/Syntax</a></b> is rescanned on opening of every new editor file.  The
       file contains rules for highlighting, each of which is  given  on  a  separate  line,  and  define  which
       keywords will be highlighted with what color.

       The  file  is  divided into sections, each beginning with a line with the <b>file</b> command.  The sections are
       normally put into separate files using the <b>include</b> command.

       The <b>file</b> command has three arguments.  The first argument is a regular expression that is applied to  the
       file  name  to  determine  if  the  following  section  applies  to the file.  The second argument is the
       description of the file type.  It is used in <b>cooledit</b>; future versions of <b>mcedit</b> may use it as well.  The
       third optional argument is a regular expression to match the first line of text of the file.   The  rules
       in the following section apply if either the file name or the first line of text matches.

       A  section  ends  with  the  start  of  another section.  Each section is divided into contexts, and each
       context contains rules.  A context is a scope within the text that a particular set of rules belongs  to.
       For  instance,  the  text within a C style comment (i.e. between <b>/*</b> and <b>*/</b>) has its own color.  This is a
       context, although it has no further rules inside it because  there  is  probably  nothing  that  we  want
       highlighted within a C comment.

       A trivial C programming section might look like this:

       file .\*\\.c C\sProgram\sFile (#include|/\\\*)

       wholechars abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_

       # default colors
       define  comment   brown
       context default
         keyword  whole  if       yellow
         keyword  whole  else     yellow
         keyword  whole  for      yellow
         keyword  whole  while    yellow
         keyword  whole  do       yellow
         keyword  whole  switch   yellow
         keyword  whole  case     yellow
         keyword  whole  static   yellow
         keyword  whole  extern   yellow
         keyword         {        brightcyan
         keyword         }        brightcyan
         keyword         '*'      green

       # C comments
       context /\* \*/ comment

       # C preprocessor directives
       context linestart # \n red
         keyword  \\\n  brightred

       # C string constants
       context " " green
         keyword  %d    brightgreen
         keyword  %s    brightgreen
         keyword  %c    brightgreen
         keyword  \\"   brightgreen

       Each context starts with a line of the form:

       <b>context</b>   [<b>exclusive</b>]  [<b>whole</b>|<b>wholeright</b>|<b>wholeleft</b>]  [<b>linestart</b>]  <u>delim</u>  [<b>linestart</b>]  <u>delim</u>  [<u>foreground</u>]
       [<u>background</u>] [<u>attributes</u>]

       The first context is an exception.  It must start with the command

       <b>context</b> <b>default</b> [<u>foreground</u>] [<u>background</u>] [<u>attributes</u>]

       otherwise <b>mcedit</b> will report an error.  The <b>linestart</b> option specifies  that  <u>delim</u>  must  start  at  the
       beginning  of  a  line.   The <b>whole</b> option tells that <u>delim</u> must be a whole word.  To specify that a word
       must begin on the word boundary only on the left side, you can use the <b>wholeleft</b> option, and similarly  a
       word that must end on the word boundary is specified by <b>wholeright</b>.

       The  set  of  characters  that  constitute  a whole word can be changed at any point in the file with the
       <b>wholechars</b> command.  The left and right set of characters can be set separately with

       <b>wholechars</b> [<b>left</b>|<b>right</b>] <u>characters</u>

       The <b>exclusive</b> option causes the text between the delimiters to be highlighted,  but  not  the  delimiters
       themselves.

       Each rule is a line of the form:

       <b>keyword</b> [<b>whole</b>|<b>wholeright</b>|<b>wholeleft</b>] [<b>linestart</b>] <u>string</u> <u>foreground</u> [<u>background</u>] [<u>attributes</u>]

       Context or keyword strings are interpreted, so that you can include tabs and spaces with the sequences \t
       and \s.  Newlines and backslashes are specified with \n and \\ respectively.  Since whitespace is used as
       a  separator, it may not be used as is.  Also, \* must be used to specify an asterisk.  The * itself is a
       wildcard that matches any length of characters.  For example,

         keyword         '*'      green

       colors all C single character constants green.  You also could use

         keyword         "*"      green

       to color string constants, but the matched string would not be allowed to span across multiple  newlines.
       The wildcard may be used within context delimiters as well, but you cannot have a wildcard as the last or
       first character.

       Important to note is the line

         keyword  \\\n  brightgreen

       This  line  defines  a  keyword  containing the backslash and newline characters.  Since the keywords are
       matched before the context delimiters, this keyword prevents the context from ending at the  end  of  the
       lines that end in a backslash, thus allowing C preprocessor directive to continue across multiple lines.

       The  possible  colors  are:  black,  gray,  red,  brightred,  green,  brightgreen,  brown,  yellow, blue,
       brightblue, magenta, brightmagenta, cyan, brightcyan, lightgray and white. The special keyword  "default"
       means  the  terminal's  default. Another special keyword "base" means mc's main colors, it is useful as a
       placeholder if you want to specify attributes without modifying the background color. When 256 colors are
       available, they can be specified either as color16 to color255, or as  rgb000  to  rgb555  and  gray0  to
       gray23.

       If  the  syntax  file  is shared with <b>cooledit</b>, it is possible to specify different colors for <b>mcedit</b> and
       <b>cooledit</b> by separating them with a slash, e.g.

       keyword  #include  red/Orange

       <b>mcedit</b> uses the color before the slash.  See <a href="../man1/cooledit.1.html">cooledit</a>(1) for supported <b>cooledit</b> colors.

       Attributes can be any of bold, italic, underline, reverse and blink, appended by a plus sign if more than
       one are desired.

       Comments may be put on a separate line starting with the hash sign (#).

       If you are describing case insensitive language you need to use <b>caseinsensitive</b> directive. It  should  be
       specified at the beginning of syntax file.

       Because  of the simplicity of the implementation, there are a few intricacies that will not be dealt with
       correctly but these are a minor irritation.   On  the  whole,  a  broad  spectrum  of  quite  complicated
       situations  are  handled with these simple rules.  It is a good idea to take a look at the syntax file to
       see some of the nifty tricks you can do with a little imagination.  If you cannot get by with the rules I
       have coded, and you think you have a rule that would be  useful,  please  email  me  with  your  request.
       However, do not ask for regular expression support, because this is flatly impossible.

       A useful hint is to work with as much as possible with the things you can do rather than try to do things
       that  this implementation cannot deal with.  Also remember that the aim of syntax highlighting is to make
       programming less prone to error, not to make code look pretty.

       The syntax highlighting can be toggled using Ctrl-s shortcut.

</pre><h4><b>COLORS</b></h4><pre>
       The default colors may be changed by appending to the <b>MC_COLOR_TABLE</b>  environment  variable.   Foreground
       and background colors pairs may be specified for example with:

       MC_COLOR_TABLE="$MC_COLOR_TABLE:\
       editnormal=lightgray,black:\
       editbold=yellow,black:\
       editmarked=black,cyan"

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Most  options  can  be  set  from  Options  dialog box.  See the <b>Options</b> menu.  The following options are
       defined in <b><a href="file:~/.config/mc/ini">~/.config/mc/ini</a></b> and have obvious counterparts in the dialog box.   You  can  modify  them  to
       change  the  editor  behavior, by editing the file.  Unless specified, a 1 sets the option to on, and a 0
       sets it to off, as usual.

       <u>use_internal_edit</u>
              This option is ignored when invoking <b>mcedit</b>.

       <u>editor_tab_spacing</u>
              Interpret the tab character as being of this length.  Default is 8. You should avoid  using  other
              than   8   since   most   other  editors  and  text  viewers  assume  a  tab  spacing  of  8.  Use
              <b>editor_fake_half_tabs</b> to simulate a smaller tab spacing.

       <u>editor_fill_tabs_with_spaces</u>
              Never insert a tab character. Rather insert spaces (ascii 32) to fill to the desired tab size.

       <u>editor_return_does_auto_indent</u>
              Pressing return will tab across to match the indentation of the first line above that has text  on
              it.

       <u>editor_backspace_through_tabs</u>
              Make  a  single  backspace delete all the space to the left margin if there is no text between the
              cursor and the left margin.

       <u>editor_fake_half_tabs</u>
              This will emulate a half tab for those who want to program with a tab spacing of  4,  but  do  not
              want  the  tab  size changed from 8 (so that the code will be formatted the same when displayed by
              other programs). When editing between text and the left margin, moving  and  tabbing  will  be  as
              though  a tab space were 4, while actually using spaces and normal tabs for an optimal fill.  When
              editing anywhere else, a normal tab is inserted.

       <u>editor_option_save_mode</u>
              Possible values 0, 1 and 2.  The save mode (see the options menu also) allows you  to  change  the
              method  of  saving a file.  Quick save (0) saves the file immediately, truncating the disk file to
              zero length (i.e.  erasing it) and then writing the editor contents to the file.  This  method  is
              fast,  but  dangerous,  since a system error during a file save will leave the file only partially
              written, possibly rendering the data irretrievable.  When saving, the safe save (1) option enables
              creation of a temporary file into which the file contents are first written.  In the  event  of  a
              problem,  the  original file is untouched.  When the temporary file is successfully written, it is
              renamed to the name of the original file, thus replacing it.  The safest method is create  backups
              (2):  a  backup file is created before any changes are made.  You can specify your own backup file
              extension in the dialog.  Note that saving twice will replace your backup as well as your original
              file.

       <u>editor_word_wrap_line_length</u>
              Line length to wrap at. Default is 72.

       <u>editor_backup_extension</u>
              Symbol to add to name of backup files. Default is "~".

       <u>editor_line_state</u>
              Show state line of editor. Currently it shows current line number (in the  future  it  might  show
              things like folding, breakpoints, etc.). M-n toggles this option.

       <u>editor_visible_spaces</u>
              Toggle "show visible trailing spaces".  If editor_visible_spaces=1, they are shown as '.'

       <u>editor_visible_tabs</u>
              Toggle "show visible tabs".  If editor_visible_tabs=1, tabs are shown as '&lt;----&gt;'

       <u>editor_persistent_selections</u>
              Do not remove block selection after cursor movement.

       <u>editor_drop_selection_on_copy</u>
              Reset selection after copy to clipboard.

       <u>editor_cursor_beyond_eol</u>
              Allow moving cursor beyond the end of line.

       <u>editor_cursor_after_inserted_block</u>
              Allow moving cursor after inserted block.

       <u>editor_syntax_highlighting</u>
              enable syntax highlighting.

       <u>editor_edit_confirm_save</u>
              Show confirmation dialog on save.

       <u>editor_option_typewriter_wrap</u>
              to be described

       <u>editor_option_auto_para_formatting</u>
              to be described

       <u>editor_option_save_position</u>
              Save file position on exit.

       <u>source_codepage</u>
