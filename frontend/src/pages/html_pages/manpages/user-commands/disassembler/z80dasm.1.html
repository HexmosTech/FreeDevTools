</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       z80dasm - Z80 assembly generating disassembler

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>z80dasm</b> [ <u>options</u> ] <u>file</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>z80dasm</b>  disassembles  a  binary  file  containing  Z80  machine  code  into Z80 assembly language source
       (including a number of undocumented opcodes). It can try to guess locations of labels in the code or  the
       labels  can  be  specified  by  hand  in  the  form  of  a  symbol  file. If given proper information the
       disassembler can also split the binary file into code and data sections of several different types.

       Generated source file can be assembled back into the original binary using z80asm, zasm or  the  original
       Zilog assembler (when the <b>--zilog</b> option was used).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a,</b> <b>--address</b>
              Print  the address of the memory location corresponding to each line of assembly code in a comment
              at the end of the line.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--block-def=FILE</b>
              Read block information from a file. If this option is not specified the default is for the  entire
              file to contain machine code. See <b>BLOCK</b> <b>FILE</b> below.

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--origin=ORG</b>
              Specify  the start address of the binary code being disassembled. A corresponding <u>org</u> directive is
              generated in the output file.  The argument is read in hexadecimal if  it  begins with 0x  or  0X,
              in octal if it begins with 0, and in base 10 otherwise. Default is 0x0100.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show summary of options and exit.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--labels</b>
              Try to guess label locations from jump instructions and add them to the assembly code.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--output=FILE</b>
              Specify the output file. Default is to write to standard output.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--sym-order=SORT</b>
              Ordering  of symbols in the symbol file. SORT can be <u>default</u> (sort by value) or <u>frequency</u> (sort by
              usage frequency).

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--sym-output=FILE</b>
              Write symbol information into a file.

       <b>-S,</b> <b>--sym-input=FILE</b>
              Read symbol information from a file. See <b>SYMBOL</b> <b>FILE</b> below.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--source</b>
              Print the binary data corresponding to each line of assembly code in a comment at the end  of  the
              line.  Data is printed in hex and ASCII. This is useful for identifying data sections in the first
              disassembly.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--undoc</b>
              By default, all undocumented instructions are disassembled as <u>defb</u> directives with the instruction
              name in a comment. This is due to missing or buggy support  for  many  of  these  instructions  in
              z80asm.  If  this  option  is  specified,  undocumented instructions are written directly into the
              disassembly.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Increase verbosity level.  Specify multiple times to  be  more  verbose.   Messages  are  sent  to
              standard error.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Display version information and exit.

       <b>-z,</b> <b>--zilog</b>
              Enable  compatibility  mode  for the original Zilog Z80 assembler. This currently only changes the
              syntax of relative jumps.

</pre><h4><b>SYMBOL</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Symbol files written by <b>z80dasm</b> can be directly used as input symbol files with the  <b>--sym-input</b>  option.
       The  following  directives  are  recognized in input symbol files and are propagated to the output symbol
       files:

       <b>include</b> "filename"
              Include another symbol file. Double quotes are mandatory. Included files must be  in  the  current
              directory.

       symbol: <b>equ</b> value
              Define  a  symbol  with  a  value. The value is read in hexadecimal if it begins with 0x or 0X, in
              octal if it begins with 0, and in base 10 otherwise. Default is 0x0100.

       <b>;</b> comment
              All characters between a semi-colon and end of line are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>BLOCK</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Block files specify the boundaries between different blocks (sections) of binary data in the disassembler
       input file. The following directives are recognized:

       name: <b>[</b> <b>unlabeled</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>start</b> <b>|</b> <b>first</b> <b>]</b> address <b>[</b> <b>unlabeled</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>end</b> <b>|</b> <b>last</b> <b>]</b> address <b>type</b> type
              Define a block with the start and end address that contains a certain type of binary data.

              Start address is the 16 bit address of the first byte in the block. Keywords "start"  and  "first"
              are  synonymous.  If  the keyword "end" is used, the end address is the 16 bit address of the last
              byte in the block plus one. If the keyword "last" is used, the end address is the 16  bit  address
              of the last byte in block.

              Normally  labels  are  defined  at  the  addresses  specified in the block definition. This can be
              suppressed by adding the keyword "unlabeled" before the address.

       <b>;</b> comment
              All characters between a semi-colon and end of line are ignored.

       The following block types are supported:

       <b>code</b>   Block containing Z80 machine code. Data in this block will be written in Z80 assembly language.

       <b>bytedata</b>
              Data block containing separate bytes. Data in this block will be written with <u>defb</u> directives.

       <b>worddata</b>
              Data block containing 16 bit words (low order byte first). Data in this block will be written with
              <u>defw</u> directives.

       <b>pointers</b>
              Data block containing 16 bit pointers (low order byte first). This type is equivalent to  <b>worddata</b>
              except that values will be replaced with labels where that is possible.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       If  disassembly  was  successful  <b>z80dasm</b> returns 0. On error diagnostic messages are printed to standard
       error and <b>z80dasm</b> returns 1.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
