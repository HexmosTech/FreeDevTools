</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rtl_tcp - an I/Q spectrum server for RTL2832 based DVB-T receivers

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Uses  a  re-purposed  DVB-T  receiver  as  a  software defined radio to receive and send I/Q data via TCP
       network to another demodulation, decoding or logging apllication. Written for and incorporated  into  the
       osmocom rtl-sdr project.

       Much software is available for the RTL2832. Most of the user-level packages rely on the librtlsdr library
       which  comes  as  part of the rtl-sdr codebase. This codebase contains both the library itself and also a
       number of command line tools such as rtl_test, rtl_sdr, rtl_tcp, and rtl_fm. These command line tools use
       the library to test for the existence of RTL2832 devices and to perform basic data transfer functions  to
       and from the device.

       Because  most of the RTL2832 devices are connected using USB, the librtlsdr library depends on the libusb
       library to communicate with the device.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Run this program on a machine with an rtl-sdr supported device connected and it will provide I/Q data  to
       other applications via TCP/IP.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rtl_tcp</b> <b>[OPTIONS]</b>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -a listen address

       -p listen port (default: 1234)

       -f frequency to tune to [Hz]

       -g gain (default: 0 for auto)

       -s samplerate in Hz (default: 2048000 Hz)

       -b number of buffers (default: 32, set by library)

       -n max number of linked list buffers to keep (default: 500)

       -d device_index (default: 0)

       -P ppm_error (default: 0)

</pre><h4><b>Example:</b></h4><pre>
       rtl_tcp -a 10.0.0.2 [-p listen port (default: 1234)]
               Found 1 device(s).
               Found Elonics E4000 tuner
               Using Generic RTL2832U (e.g. hama nano)
               Tuned to 100000000 Hz.
               listening...

       Use  the device argument 'rtl_tcp=10.0.0.2:1234' in OsmoSDR (gr-osmosdr) source to receive samples in GRC
       and control rtl_tcp parameters (frequency, gain, ...).

       use the rtl_tcp=... device argument in gr-osmosdr source to receive the samples in GRC  and  control  the
       rtl settings remotely.

       This application has been successfully crosscompiled for ARM and MIPS devices and is providing IQ data in
       a  networked  ADS-B  setup  at  a  rate  of 2.4MSps. The gr-osmosdr source is being used together with an
       optimized gr-air-modes version (see Known Apps below). It is also available as a package in OpenWRT.

       A use case is described â€‹https://sites.google.com/site/embrtlsdr/
