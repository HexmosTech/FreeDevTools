</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       int6kstat - Qualcomm Atheros INT6x00 Link Statistics

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>int6kstat</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>device</u>] [...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Atheros  Device  Statistics Utility polls a device and prints network and link statistics in various
       formats suitable for use by other programs.  This is a work in progress so usr feedback is encouraged.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the <b>plc</b> man page for an overview and
       installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -<b>C</b>     Clear device link statistics using VS_LNK_STATS.  Statistics are read and cleared then  displayed.
              The statistics that are read and displayed depend on options <b>-d</b>, <b>-p</b> and <b>-s</b> but all link statistics
              are cleared.

       -<b>d</b> <u>direction</u>
              Return  statistics  for  the specified direction using VS_LNK_STATS.  Direction can be <b>0</b>=tx, <b>1</b>=rx,
              <b>2</b>=both or "<b>rx</b>", "<b>tx</b>" or "<b>both</b>".

       -<b>e</b>     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status  and  error  messages  are  printed  on
              stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout
              in cases where this is desired.

       -<b>i</b>     Select  the  host  Ethernet  interface.   All  requests  are sent via this host interface and only
              reponses received via this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is  <b>eth1</b>  because
              most  people  use <b>eth0</b> as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC"
              is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.  This option then takes precedence
              over either default.

       -<b>l</b> <u>count</u>
              Define the number of times that the command will be repeated for each device specified.  Normally,
              you will repeat operations on one device only.

       -<b>m</b>     Displays network membership information, as seen by one device, using VS_NW_INFO.  Use  option  <b>-t</b>
              for complete network topology seen by the local host.

       -<b>p</b> <u>peernode</u>
              Ethernet hardware address of the peer node for VS_LNK_STATS.  This option is required for all Link
              ID values except <b>0xFC</b>.  The default is <b>00:00:00:00:00:00</b>.

       -<b>q</b>     Enter quiet mode.  Progress messages are suppressed.

       -<b>s</b> <u>linkid</u>
              The  Link  ID  for  VS_LNK_STATS.   Link ID values range from <b>0</b> through <b>255</b> but not all values are
              accepted by the device firmware.  Values may be expressed in decimal, binary prefixed with "<b>0b</b>" or
              hexadecimal prefixed by "<b>0x</b>".  Many valid values can be  expressed  by  name.   Valid  values  are
              listed and explained under <b>LINKID</b>.  The default Link ID is <b>0xFC</b>.

       -<b>t</b>     Display  network  topology  using  VS_SW_VER  and  VS_NW_INFO messages.  This option is similar to
              option <b>-m</b> but provides complete network  topology  plus  device  hardware  and  firmware  version.
              Topology is relative to the queried powerline device(s) given on the command line. If no device is
              given  explicitly,  then  it  is  tried  to  determine  all  local devices (you can also use <b>local</b>
              instead).  However, this can fail if you have the local powerline device(s) not directly connected
              but via a switch which does not broadcast the Qualcomm Atheros vendor  specific  Local  Management
              Address (LMA) to all ports.  PHY rates displayed by this option may saturate at 255 Mbps.

       -<b>v</b>     Enter verbose mode.  All Etherenet frames sent or received by the program are displayed on stdout.

       -<b>w</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Defines  the  number of <u>seconds</u> to wait before repeating command line options.  This option has no
              effect unless option -<b>l</b> is also specified with a non-zero value.

       -<b>?</b>, --<b>help</b>
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence  over  other  options  on  the
              command line.

       -<b>!</b>, --<b>version</b>
              Print  program  version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on
              the command line.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so  that
              they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>device</b> The  MAC  address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified.  If more than
              one address is specified then operations are performed  on  each  device  in  turn.   The  default
              address is <b>local</b>.  See <b>DEVICES</b> for information about symbolic device addresses.

</pre><h4><b>LINKID</b></h4><pre>
       <b>0x00</b>,<b>CSMA-CAP0</b>
              Display CSMA statistics for CAP0 traffic using a single peer node.  The peer node MAC address must
              be specified using option <b>-p</b>.

       <b>0x01</b>,<b>CSMA-CAP1</b>
              Display CSMA statistics for CAP1 traffic using a single peer node.  The peer node MAC address must
              be specified using option <b>-p</b>.

       <b>0x02</b>,<b>CSMA-CAP2</b>
              Display CSMA statistics for CAP2 traffic using a single peer node.  The peer node MAC address must
              be specified using option <b>-p</b>.

       <b>0x03</b>,<b>CSMA-CAP3</b>
              Display CSMA statistics for CAP3 traffic using a single peer node.  The peer node MAC address must
              be specified using option <b>-p</b>.

       <b>0xF8</b>,<b>CSMA-PEER</b>
              Display CSMA statistics for all traffic using a single  peer node.  The peer node MAC address must
              be specified using option <b>-p</b>.

       <b>0xFC</b>,<b>CSMA-ALL</b>
              Display  CSMA  statistics  for  all  traffic  with all peer nodes.  A peer node MAC address is not
              needed and will be ignored if provided.  This value is the default for option <b>-s</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address  is  a  48-bit  value
       entered  as  12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be separated with
       colons for clarity.  For example, "00b052000001", "00:b0:52:00:00:01" and "00b052:000001" are  valid  and
       equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       <b>all</b>    Same as "broadcast".

       <b>broadcast</b>
              A  synonym  for  the  Ethernet  broadcast address, <b>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</b>.  All devices, whether local,
              remote or foreign recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device  at  the
              far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       <b>local</b>  A   synonym   for   the   Qualcomm   Atheros  vendor  specific  Local  Management  Address  (LMA),
              <b>00:B0:52:00:00:01</b>.  All local Atheros devices  recognize  this  address  but  remote  and  foreign
              devices  do  not.   A  remote  device  is  any device at the far end of a powerline connection.  A
              foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.
