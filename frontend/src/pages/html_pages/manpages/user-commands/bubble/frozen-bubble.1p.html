</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       frozen-bubble - arcade/reflex game

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           frozen-bubble [OPTION]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Frozen-Bubble</b> game is a free software implementation of a popular arcade/reflex game. The game mainly
       consists of firing randomly chosen bubbles across the board. If the shoot ends up having a clump of at
       least 3 bubbles of the same color, they all pop. If some bubbles were sticked only on the popping clump,
       they fall. In 1-player mode, the goal is to pop all the bubbles on the board as quickly as possible. In
       2-players or network mode, you have to get your opponent to "die" before you.

</pre><h4><b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       The default controlling mechanism is through the keyboard, but you can play with a joystick or a joypad
       if it is supported by the system (use the commandline option <b>-ji</b> to make sure frozen-bubble detected your
       joysticks). A key (or a joystick direction or button) is needed for moving the aim to the left, moving
       the aim to the right, center, and fire.

</pre><h4><b>1-PLAYER</b> <b>GAME</b></h4><pre>
       In single player mode, as a beginner the best training is to choose <b>Play</b> <b>Default</b> <b>Levelset</b>, which lets you
       run through 100 levels of an increasing difficulty. Pop all the bubbles of each level to advance to the
       next level.

       If you want to train for multiplayer, choose <b>Multiplayer</b> <b>Training</b> which reproduces the conditions of
       2-player or network mode; the only difference is that created malus bubbles are counted in your score,
       and you must get the highest score you can in 2 minutes.

</pre><h4><b>2-PLAYERS</b> <b>GAME</b></h4><pre>
       In 2-players mode, you can play against a friend (or a foe, actually) on the same computer. The board is
       populated with random bubbles, and your goal is to make big clumps to send malus bubbles to your
       opponent.

</pre><h4><b>NETWORK</b> <b>GAME</b></h4><pre>
       If your computer has networking, you can choose LAN GAME to play games against others on your local
       network (up to 5 players).  Frozen-Bubble will look for a game server on the local network with a UDP
       broadcast, connect to it if found, or start a new game server if not found.

       If your computer is connected to Internet, you can choose NET GAME to play against others on Earth (or
       beyond?). Frozen-Bubble will retrieve the server list from the master server and propose you to choose
       between available servers. The flag in front of a server indicates the preferred language for chatting
       with others before the game is started. The ping is the roundtrip when talking with the server, choose a
       low ping when possible.

       <b>--player-malus</b> <u>number</u>
           add <u>number</u> malus to the left player (can be negative - doesn't work in network mode)

           set the average duration between receiving malus bubbles in 1 player multiplayer training (default 30
           (= every 30 seconds on average), the lower the harder)

       <b>--joysticks-info</b>
           print  information  about  detected  joystick(s)  on  startup  (if  Frozen-Bubble  doesn't  see  your
           joysticks/joypads, try loading the joydev module with <b>modprobe</b> <b>joydev</b> as root, then retry)

       <b>--no-echo</b>
           when sound is enabled, disable echoing each typed character with a typewriter sound (it  may  get  on
           your nerves)

       <b>--my-nick</b> <u>nick</u>
           for  NET/LAN games, use this nick instead of username (max 10 chars, ASCII alphanumeric plus dash and
           underscore only) - notice that the /nick command is also available when connected to a server to  set
           your nick

       <b>--private</b>
           after  connecting  to  a  server  for  a  NET  game,  don't  use <a href="http://hostip.info/">http://hostip.info/</a> to retrieve your
           geographical position to send it to other players

       <b>--record</b> <u>directory</u>
           specify   the   recording   directory   (normally,   records   are    saved    in    the    directory
           '.frozen-bubble/records' down your home directory)

       <b>--auto-record</b>
           automatically  record  all  applicable  games  (normally,  a record is triggered by hitting the Print
           Screen key during a game)

       <b>--comment</b> <u>'...'</u>
           add the comment enclosed between simple quotes to  records  (must  not  contain  anything  else  than
           ASCII), it will be shown on console when playing back the record later

       <b>--replay</b> <u>record_file|URL</u>
           playback the specified record file

       <b>--save-frames</b> <u>directory</u>
           specify a directory where all (game) frames will be recorded; as the game is slowed down, can only be
           used with --replay; warning, output is huge as 50 frames of each 900 KB are saved per second (e.g. 43
           MB  per second); a typical use case is then to build a video out of the frames with e.g. this kind of
           command:

               mencoder mf:///tmp/fbframes/frame* -mf fps=50 -o /tmp/output.avi -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4
