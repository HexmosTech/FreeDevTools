       confirm-paste - ask for confirmation before pasting control characters

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Displays a confirmation dialog when a paste containing control characters is detected. The user can
       choose "y" to either paste a sanitized variant where all control characters are removed, "p" to paste the
       string unmodified or "n" to drop the paste request completely.

       This is mostly meant as a defense-in-depth mechanism to protect against the common web browser bug of you
       selecting some text but the browser pasting a completely different text, which has some attack potential.

       It can also be useful to prevent you from accidentally pasting large amounts of text.

   <b>DETAILS</b>
       If a string containing unicode control characters (specifically U+0000 ..  U+001F currrently) is pasted
       into the terminal, this extension will ask whether it should be pasted. Strings without control
       characters get pasted without prompt.

       When a sanitized version is pasted (choice "y"), then contiguous sequences of those control characters
       will be replaced by a single spaces.

       The exact detection and sanitization algorithm is subject to change in future versions.
