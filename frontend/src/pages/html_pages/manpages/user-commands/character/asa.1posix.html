</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       asa — interpret carriage-control characters

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       asa <b>[</b><u>file</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>asa</u> utility shall write its input files to standard output, mapping carriage-control characters from
       the text files to line-printer control sequences in an implementation-defined manner.

       The first character of every line shall be  removed  from  the  input,  and  the  following  actions  are
       performed.

       If the character removed is:

       &lt;space&gt;   The rest of the line is output without change.

       0         A &lt;newline&gt; is output, then the rest of the input line.

       1         One  or more implementation-defined characters that causes an advance to the next page shall be
                 output, followed by the rest of the input line.

       +         The &lt;newline&gt; of the previous line shall be replaced with one  or  more  implementation-defined
                 characters  that  causes  printing  to return to column position 1, followed by the rest of the
                 input line. If the <b>'+'</b> is the first character in the input, it shall be equivalent to &lt;space&gt;.

       The action of the <u>asa</u> utility is unspecified upon encountering any  character  other  than  those  listed
       above as the first character in a line.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>file</u>      A pathname of a text file used for input. If no <u>file</u> operands are specified, the standard input
                 shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The  standard  input shall be used if no <u>file</u> operands are specified, and shall be used if a <u>file</u> operand
       is <b>'-'</b> and the implementation treats the <b>'-'</b> as meaning standard input.  Otherwise,  the  standard  input
       shall not be used.  See the INPUT FILES section.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The input files shall be text files.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>asa</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The standard output shall be the text from the input  file  modified  as  described  in  the  DESCRIPTION
       section.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All input files were output successfully.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. The following command:

               asa <u>file</u>

           permits the viewing of <u>file</u> (created by a program using FORTRAN-style carriage-control characters) on
           a terminal.

        2. The following command:

               a.out | asa | lp

           formats the FORTRAN output of <b>a.out</b> and directs it to the printer.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>asa</u>  utility  is needed to map ``standard'' FORTRAN 77 output into a form acceptable to contemporary
       printers. Usually, <u>asa</u> is used to pipe data to the <u>lp</u> utility; see <u>lp</u>.

       This utility is generally used only by FORTRAN programs. The standard developers decided to retain <u>asa</u> to
       avoid breaking the historical large base of FORTRAN applications that put carriage-control characters  in
       their  output  files.  There  is  no  requirement  that  a system have a FORTRAN compiler in order to run
       applications that need <u>asa</u>.

       Historical implementations have used an ASCII &lt;form-feed&gt; in response to a  1  and  an  ASCII  &lt;carriage-
       return&gt; in response to a <b>'+'</b>.  It is suggested that implementations treat characters other than 0, 1, and
       <b>'+'</b>  as  &lt;space&gt;  in  the absence of any compelling reason to do otherwise. However, the action is listed
       here as ``unspecified'', permitting an implementation to provide extensions to access fast  multiple-line
       slewing and channel seeking in a non-portable manner.
