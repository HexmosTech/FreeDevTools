</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       diffpdf - compare two PDF files textually or visually

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>diffpdf</b> [<u>file1</u>] [<u>file2</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  very briefly documents the <b>diffpdf</b> command.  (Click the GUI's Help button or press F1
       for more information.)

       <b>DiffPDF</b> is a GUI application used to compare two PDF files.
       By default the comparison is of the words on each pair of pages, but comparing character by character  is
       also  supported  (e.g.,  for  logographic languages). And there's also support for comparing the pages by
       appearance (for example, if a diagram is changed or if a paragraph is reformatted, or a font changed). It
       is also possible to compare particular pages or page ranges. For example, if there are two versions of  a
       PDF file, one with pages 1-12 and the other with pages 1-13 because of an extra page having been added as
       page  4,  they  can  be  compared by specifying two page ranges, 1-12 for the first and 1-3, 5-13 for the
       second. This will make DiffPDF compare pages in the pairs (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 5), (5, 6), and  so
       on, to (12, 13).

       If  the  program is passed two PDF filenames on the command line it will start up and compare those files
       in Text mode (or in Appearance mode if the filenames are preceded by -a or --appearance).
