</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ascii - report character aliases

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>ascii</b> [-dxohv] [-t] [<u>char-alias</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Called with no options, <b>ascii</b> behaves like `ascii -h'. Options are as follows:

       -t
           Script-friendly mode, emits only ISO/decimal/hex/octal/binary encodings of the character.

       -s
           Parse multiple characters. Convenient way of parsing strings.

       -a
           Print in vertical aspect (4 columns by 16 rows) rather than 16x4. This option combines only with -d
           -o -x -b and must precede them.

       -d
           Ascii table in decimal.

       -x
           Ascii table in hex.

       -o
           Ascii table in octal.

       -b
           Ascii table in binary.

       -h, -?
           Show summary of options and a simple ASCII table.

       -v
           Show version of program.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Characters in the ASCII set can have many aliases, depending on context. A character's possible names
       include:

       •   Its bit pattern (binary representation).

       •   Its hex, decimal and octal representations.

       •   Its teletype mnemonic and caret-notation form (for control chars).

       •   Its backlash-escape form in C (for some control chars).

       •   Its printed form (for printables).

       •   Its full ISO official name in English.

       •   Its ISO/ECMA code table reference.

       •   Its name as an HTML/SGML entity.

       •   Slang and other names in wide use for it among hackers.

       This utility accepts command-line strings and tries to interpret them as one of the above. When it finds
       a value, it prints <u>all</u> of the names of the character. The constructs in the following list can be used to
       specify character values. If an argument could be interpreted in two or more ways, names for all the
       different characters it might be are dumped.

       <u>character</u>
           Any character not described by one of the following conventions represents the character itself.

       <b>^</b><u>character</u>
           A caret followed by a character.

       <b>\</b><u>[abfnrtv0]</u>
           A backslash followed by certain special characters (abfnrtv).

       <u>mnemonic</u>
           An ASCII teletype mnemonic.

       <u>hexadecimal</u>
           A hexadecimal (hex) sequence consists of one or two case-insensitive hex digit characters
           (01234567890abcdef). To ensure hex interpretation use <u>hex</u><b>h</b><u>,</u> <b>0x</b><u>hex,</u> <b>x</b><u>hex</u> or <b>\x</b><u>hex.</u>

       <u>decimal</u>
           A decimal sequence consists of one, two or three decimal digit characters (0123456789). To ensure
           decimal interpretation use <b>\0d</b><u>decimal,</u> <b>d</b><u>decimal,</u> or <b>\d</b><u>decimal.</u>

       <u>octal</u>
           An octal sequence consists of one, two or three octal digit characters (01234567). To ensure octal
           interpretation use <b>\</b><u>&lt;octal&gt;,</u> <b>0o</b><u>&lt;octal&gt;,</u> <b>o</b><u>&lt;octal&gt;,</u> or <b>\o</b><u>&lt;octal&gt;.</u>

       <u>bit</u> <u>pattern</u>
           A bit pattern (binary) sequence consists of one to eight binary digit characters (01). To ensure bit
           interpretation use <b>0b</b><u>&lt;bit</u> <u>pattern&gt;,</u> <b>b</b><u>&lt;bit</u> <u>pattern&gt;</u> or <b>\b</b><u>&lt;bit</u> <u>pattern&gt;.</u>

       <u>ISO</u>/<u>ECMA</u> <u>code</u>
           An ISO/ECMA code sequence consists of one or two decimal digit characters, a slash, and one or two
           decimal digit characters.

       <u>name</u>
           An official ASCII or (unofficial) slang name.

       The slang names recognized and printed out are from a rather comprehensive list that first appeared on
       USENET in early 1990 and has been continuously updated since. Mnemonics recognized and printed include
       the official ASCII set, some official ISO names (where those differ) and a few common-use alternatives
       (such as NL for LF). HTML/SGML entity names are also printed when applicable. All comparisons are
       case-insensitive, and dashes are mapped to spaces. Any unrecognized arguments or out of range values are
       silently ignored. Note that the <b>-s</b> option will not recognize 'long' names, as it cannot differentiate
       them from other parts of the string.

       For correct results, be careful to stringize or quote shell metacharacters in arguments (especially
       backslash).

       This utility is particularly handy for interpreting <a href="../man1/cc.1.html">cc</a>(1)'s ugly octal `invalid-character' messages, or
       when coding anything to do with serial communications. As a side effect it serves as a handy
       base-converter for random 8-bit values.
