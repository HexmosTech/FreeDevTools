</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xfd - display all the characters in an X font

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xfd</b> [-options ...] <b>-fn</b> <u>fontname</u>

       <b>xfd</b> [-options ...] <b>-fa</b> <u>fontname</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>xfd</u>  utility  creates  a  window  containing  the name of the font being displayed, a row of command
       buttons, several lines of text for displaying character metrics, and a  grid  containing  one  glyph  per
       cell.   The  characters  are  shown  in  increasing  order  from left to right, top to bottom.  The first
       character displayed at the top left will be character number 0 unless the <b>-start</b> option has been supplied
       in which case the character with the number given in the <b>-start</b> option will be used.

       The characters are displayed in a grid of boxes, each large enough to hold any single  character  in  the
       font.   Each  character  glyph  is  drawn  using  the  PolyText16  request  (used  by  the  <u>Xlib</u>  routine
       <b>XDrawString16</b>) or the XftDrawString32 routine, depending on whether the <b>-fn</b> or <b>-fa</b> option was given.   If
       the  <b>-box</b>  option is given, a rectangle will be drawn around each character, showing where an ImageText16
       request (used by the <u>Xlib</u> routine <b>XDrawImageString16</b>) would cause background color to be displayed.

       The origin of each glyph is normally set so that the character is drawn in the upper left hand corner  of
       the grid cell.  However, if a glyph has a negative left bearing or an unusually large ascent, descent, or
       right  bearing  (as is the case with <u>cursor</u> font), some character may not appear in their own grid cells.
       The <b>-center</b> option may be used to force all glyphs to be centered in their respective cells.

       All the characters in the font may not fit in the window at once.  To see the next page of glyphs,  press
       the  <u>Next</u>  button  at  the  top of the window.  To see the previous page, press <u>Prev</u>.  To exit <u>xfd</u>, press
       <u>Quit</u>.

       Individual character metrics (index, width, bearings, ascent and descent) can be displayed at the top  of
       the window by clicking on the desired character.

       The  font  name  displayed  at  the  top of the window is the full name of the font, as determined by the
       server.  See <u>xlsfonts</u> and <u>fc-list</u> for ways to generate lists of fonts, as well as more detailed summaries
       of their metrics and properties.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xfd</u> accepts all of the standard toolkit command line options along with  the  additional  options  listed
       below:

       <b>-fn</b> <u>font</u>
               This option specifies the core X server side font to be displayed.  This can also be set with the
               FontGrid <b>font</b> resource.  A font must be specified.

       <b>-fa</b> <u>font</u>
               This  option  specifies  a  Xft font to be displayed. This can also be set with the FontGrid <b>face</b>
               resource. A font pattern must be specified.

       <b>-box</b>    This option indicates that a box should be displayed outlining the area that would be filled with
               background color by an ImageText request.  This can  also  be  set  with  the  FontGrid  <b>boxChars</b>
               resource.  The default is False.

       <b>-center</b> This  option indicates that each glyph should be centered in its grid.  This can also be set with
               the FontGrid <b>centerChars</b> resource.  The default is False.

       <b>-start</b> <u>number</u>
               This option specifies the glyph index of the upper left hand corner of the grid.  This is used to
               view characters at arbitrary locations in the font.  This can  also  be  set  with  the  FontGrid
               <b>startChar</b> resource.  The default is 0.

       <b>-bc</b> <u>color</u>
               This  option  specifies  the color to be used if ImageText boxes are drawn.  This can also be set
               with the FontGrid <b>boxColor</b> resource.

       <b>-rows</b> <u>numrows</u>
               This option specifies the number of rows in the grid.  This can also be  set  with  the  FontGrid
               <b>cellRows</b> resource.

       <b>-columns</b> <u>numcols</u>
               This  option specifies the number of columns in the grid.  This can also be set with the FontGrid
               <b>cellColumns</b> resource.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGETS</b></h4><pre>
       In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the widgets  which  compose  <u>xfd</u>.   In  the  notation
       below,  indentation  indicates hierarchical structure.  The widget class name is given first, followed by
       the widget instance name.  The application class name is Xfd.

       Xfd  xfd
            Paned  pane
                 Label  fontname
                 Box  box
                      Command  quit
                      Command  prev
                      Command  next
                 Label  select
                 Label  metrics
                 Label  range
                 Label  start
                 Form  form
                      FontGrid  grid

</pre><h4><b>FONTGRID</b> <b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       The FontGrid widget is an application-specific widget, and a subclass of the Simple widget in the  Athena
       widget  set.  The effects and instance names of this widget's resources are given in the <b>OPTIONS</b> section.
       Capitalize the first letter of the resource instance name to get the corresponding class name.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       The instance names of the application specific resources are given below.  Capitalize the first letter of
       the resource instance name to get the corresponding class name.   These  resources  are  unlikely  to  be
       interesting unless you are localizing xfd for a different language.

       <b>selectFormat</b>
               Specifies  a printf-style format string used to display information about the selected character.
               The default is "character 0x%02x%02x (%u,%u) (%#o,%#o)".  The arguments that will come after  the
               format  string  are  char.byte1,  char.byte2,  char.byte1,  char.byte2,  char.byte1,  char.byte2.
               char.byte1 is byte 1 of the selected character.  char.byte2 is byte 2 of the selected character.

       <b>metricsFormat</b>
               Specifies a printf-style format string used to display character metrics.  The default is  "width
               %d;  left %d, right %d; ascent %d, descent %d (font %d, %d)".  The arguments that will come after
               the format string  are  the  character  metrics  width,  lbearing,  rbearing,  character  ascent,
               character descent, font ascent, and font descent.

       <b>rangeFormat</b>
               Specifies  a  printf-style  format string used to display the range of characters currently being
               displayed.  The default is "range: 0x%02x%02x (%u,%u) thru 0x%02x%02x  (%u,%u)".   The  arguments
               that  will  come  after  the  format string are the following fields from the XFontStruct that is
               returned from opening  the  font:  min_byte1,  min_char_or_byte2,  min_byte1,  min_char_or_byte2,
               max_byte1, max_char_or_byte2, max_byte1, max_char_or_byte2.

       <b>startFormat</b>
               Specifies  a  printf-style  format  string used to display information about the character at the
               upper left corner of the font grid.  The default is "upper left: 0x%04x (%d,%d)".  The  arguments
               that will come after the format string are the new character, the high byte of the new character,
               and the low byte of the new character.

       <b>nocharFormat</b>
               Specifies  a  printf-style  format  string to display when the selected character does not exist.
               The default is "no such character 0x%02x%02x (%u,%u) (%#o,%#o)".  The arguments  that  will  come
               after the format string are the same as for the <b>selectFormat</b> resource.
