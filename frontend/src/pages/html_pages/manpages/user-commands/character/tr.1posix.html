       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tr — translate characters

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       tr <b>[</b>-c|-C<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-s<b>]</b> <u>string1</u> <u>string2</u>

       tr -s <b>[</b>-c|-C<b>]</b> <u>string1</u>

       tr -d <b>[</b>-c|-C<b>]</b> <u>string1</u>

       tr -ds <b>[</b>-c|-C<b>]</b> <u>string1</u> <u>string2</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>tr</u>  utility  shall  copy  the standard input to the standard output with substitution or deletion of
       selected  characters.  The  options  specified  and  the  <u>string1</u>  and  <u>string2</u>  operands  shall  control
       translations that occur while copying characters and single-character collating elements.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>tr</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u> <u>Syntax</u>
       <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-c</b>        Complement the set of values specified by <u>string1</u>.  See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

       <b>-C</b>        Complement the set of characters specified by <u>string1</u>.  See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

       <b>-d</b>        Delete all occurrences of input characters that are specified by <u>string1</u>.

       <b>-s</b>        Replace  instances of repeated characters with a single character, as described in the EXTENDED
                 DESCRIPTION section.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>string1</u>, <u>string2</u>
                 Translation control strings. Each string shall represent a set of characters  to  be  converted
                 into  an  array  of  characters used for the translation. For a detailed description of how the
                 strings are interpreted, see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The standard input can be any type of file.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>tr</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments) and the behavior of
                 character classes.

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  operands  <u>string1</u>  and <u>string2</u> (if specified) define two arrays of characters. The constructs in the
       following list can be used to specify characters or single-character collating elements. If  any  of  the
       constructs  result  in  multi-character collating elements, <u>tr</u> shall exclude, without a diagnostic, those
       multi-character elements from the resulting array.

       <u>character</u> Any character not described by one of the conventions below shall represent itself.

       \<u>octal</u>    Octal sequences can be used to represent  characters  with  specific  coded  values.  An  octal
                 sequence shall consist of a &lt;backslash&gt; followed by the longest sequence of one, two, or three-
                 octal-digit  characters  (01234567).  The  sequence  shall  cause  the  value whose encoding is
                 represented by the one, two, or three-digit octal integer to be placed into the  array.  Multi-
                 byte  characters  require  multiple,  concatenated escape sequences of this type, including the
                 leading &lt;backslash&gt; for each byte.

       \<u>character</u>
                 The &lt;backslash&gt;-escape sequences in the Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Table</u>  <u>5-1</u>,
                 <u>Escape</u>  <u>Sequences</u> <u>and</u> <u>Associated</u> <u>Actions</u> (<b>'\\'</b>, <b>'\a'</b>, <b>'\b'</b>, <b>'\f'</b>, <b>'\n'</b>, <b>'\r'</b>, <b>'\t'</b>, <b>'\v'</b>) shall
                 be supported. The results of using any other character, other than an  octal  digit,  following
                 the  &lt;backslash&gt; are unspecified. Also, if there is no character following the &lt;backslash&gt;, the
                 results are unspecified.

       <u>c</u>-<u>c</u>       In the POSIX locale, this construct shall represent the range of collating elements between the
                 range endpoints (as long as neither  endpoint  is  an  octal  sequence  of  the  form  \<u>octal</u>),
                 inclusive,  as  defined  by the collation sequence. The characters or collating elements in the
                 range shall be placed in the array in ascending collation  sequence.  If  the  second  endpoint
                 precedes  the  starting endpoint in the collation sequence, it is unspecified whether the range
                 of collating elements is empty, or this construct is treated as invalid. In locales other  than
                 the POSIX locale, this construct has unspecified behavior.

                 If  either  or  both  of the range endpoints are octal sequences of the form \<u>octal</u>, this shall
                 represent the range of specific coded values between the two range endpoints, inclusive.

       [:<u>class</u>:] Represents all characters belonging to the defined character class, as defined by  the  current
                 setting  of the <u>LC_CTYPE</u> locale category. The following character class names shall be accepted
                 when specified in <u>string1</u>:
                 <b>alnum</b>   <b>blank</b>   <b>digit</b>   <b>lower</b>   <b>punct</b>   <b>upper</b>
                 <b>alpha</b>   <b>cntrl</b>   <b>graph</b>   <b>print</b>   <b>space</b>   <b>xdigit</b>

                 In addition, character class expressions of the form [:<u>name</u>:]  shall  be  recognized  in  those
                 locales where the <u>name</u> keyword has been given a <b>charclass</b> definition in the <u>LC_CTYPE</u> category.

                 When  both  the  <b>-d</b>  and  <b>-s</b>  options  are specified, any of the character class names shall be
                 accepted in <u>string2</u>.  Otherwise, only character class names <b>lower</b> or <b>upper</b> are valid in <u>string2</u>
                 and then only if the corresponding character class (<b>upper</b> and <b>lower</b>, respectively) is specified
                 in the same relative position in <u>string1</u>.  Such a  specification  shall  be  interpreted  as  a
                 request  for  case  conversion.  When  [:<u>lower</u>:]  appears  in  <u>string1</u> and [:<u>upper</u>:] appears in
                 <u>string2</u>, the arrays shall contain the characters from  the  <b>toupper</b>  mapping  in  the  <u>LC_CTYPE</u>
                 category  of  the  current  locale.  When [:<u>upper</u>:] appears in <u>string1</u> and [:<u>lower</u>:] appears in
                 <u>string2</u>, the arrays shall contain the characters from  the  <b>tolower</b>  mapping  in  the  <u>LC_CTYPE</u>
                 category  of  the  current  locale.  The first character from each mapping pair shall be in the
                 array for <u>string1</u> and the second character from each mapping pair shall be  in  the  array  for
                 <u>string2</u> in the same relative position.

                 Except  for  case conversion, the characters specified by a character class expression shall be
                 placed in the array in an unspecified order.

                 If the name specified for <u>class</u> does not define a valid character class in the current  locale,
                 the behavior is undefined.

       [=<u>equiv</u>=] Represents  all  characters  or  collating  elements belonging to the same equivalence class as
                 <u>equiv</u>, as defined by the current setting of the  <u>LC_COLLATE</u>  locale  category.  An  equivalence
                 class  expression  shall be allowed only in <u>string1</u>, or in <u>string2</u> when it is being used by the
                 combined <b>-d</b> and <b>-s</b> options. The characters belonging to the equivalence class shall  be  placed
                 in the array in an unspecified order.

       [<u>x</u>*<u>n</u>]     Represents  <u>n</u>  repeated occurrences of the character <u>x</u>.  Because this expression is used to map
                 multiple characters to one, it is only valid when it occurs in <u>string2</u>.  If <u>n</u> is omitted or  is
                 zero,  it  shall  be  interpreted  as  large enough to extend the <u>string2</u>-based sequence to the
                 length of the <u>string1</u>-based sequence. If <u>n</u> has a leading zero, it shall be  interpreted  as  an
                 octal value.  Otherwise, it shall be interpreted as a decimal value.

       When the <b>-d</b> option is not specified:

        *  If <u>string2</u> is present, each input character found in the array specified by <u>string1</u> shall be replaced
           by  the  character  in  the  same  relative position in the array specified by <u>string2</u>.  If the array
           specified by <u>string2</u> is shorter that the one specified by <u>string1</u>, or if a character occurs more than
           once in <u>string1</u>, the results are unspecified.

        *  If the <b>-C</b> option is specified, the complements of the characters specified by <u>string1</u> (the set of all
           characters in the current character set, as defined by the current setting of  <u>LC_CTYPE</u>,  except  for
           those  actually specified in the <u>string1</u> operand) shall be placed in the array in ascending collation
           sequence, as defined by the current setting of <u>LC_COLLATE</u>.

        *  If the <b>-c</b> option is specified, the complement of the values specified by <u>string1</u> shall be  placed  in
           the array in ascending order by binary value.

        *  Because  the  order in which characters specified by character class expressions or equivalence class
           expressions is undefined, such expressions should only be used  if  the  intent  is  to  map  several
           characters into one. An exception is case conversion, as described previously.

       When the <b>-d</b> option is specified:

        *  Input characters found in the array specified by <u>string1</u> shall be deleted.

        *  When  the  <b>-C</b>  option is specified with <b>-d</b>, all characters except those specified by <u>string1</u> shall be
           deleted. The contents of <u>string2</u> are ignored, unless the <b>-s</b> option is also specified.

        *  When the <b>-c</b> option is specified with <b>-d</b>, all values  except  those  specified  by  <u>string1</u>  shall  be
           deleted. The contents of <u>string2</u> shall be ignored, unless the <b>-s</b> option is also specified.

        *  The  same  string  cannot be used for both the <b>-d</b> and the <b>-s</b> option; when both options are specified,
           both <u>string1</u> (used for deletion) and <u>string2</u> (used for squeezing) shall be required.

       When the <b>-s</b> option is specified, after any deletions or translations have taken place, repeated sequences
       of the same character shall be replaced by one occurrence of the same  character,  if  the  character  is
       found in the array specified by the last operand. If the last operand contains a character class, such as
       the following example:

           tr -s '[:space:]'

       the  last operand's array shall contain all of the characters in that character class. However, in a case
       conversion, as described previously, such as:

           tr -s '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'

       the last operand's array shall contain only those characters defined as the second characters in each  of
       the <b>toupper</b> or <b>tolower</b> character pairs, as appropriate.

       An empty string used for <u>string1</u> or <u>string2</u> produces undefined results.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All input was processed successfully.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       If necessary, <u>string1</u> and <u>string2</u> can be quoted to avoid pattern matching by the shell.

       If  an  ordinary  digit (representing itself) is to follow an octal sequence, the octal sequence must use
       the full three digits to avoid ambiguity.

       When <u>string2</u> is shorter than <u>string1</u>, a difference results between historical System V and BSD systems. A
       BSD system pads <u>string2</u> with the last character found in  <u>string2</u>.   Thus,  it  is  possible  to  do  the
       following:

           tr 0123456789 d

       which  would translate all digits to the letter <b>'d'</b>.  Since this area is specifically unspecified in this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, both the BSD and System V behaviors are allowed,  but  a  conforming  application
       cannot rely on the BSD behavior. It would have to code the example in the following way:

           tr 0123456789 '[d*]'

       It  should  be  noted  that,  despite  similarities in appearance, the string operands used by <u>tr</u> are not
       regular expressions.

       Unlike some historical implementations, this  definition  of  the  <u>tr</u>  utility  correctly  processes  NUL
       characters in its input stream. NUL characters can be stripped by using:

           tr -d '\000'

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. The  following  example  creates  a list of all words in <b>file1</b> one per line in <b>file2</b>, where a word is
           taken to be a maximal string of letters.

               tr -cs "[:alpha:]" "[\n*]" &lt;file1 &gt;file2

        2. The next example translates all lowercase characters in <b>file1</b> to uppercase and writes the results  to
           standard output.

               tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]" &lt;file1

        3. This  example  uses  an  equivalence class to identify accented variants of the base character <b>'e'</b> in
           <b>file1</b>, which are stripped of diacritical marks and written to <b>file2</b>.

               tr "[=e=]" "[e*]" &lt;file1 &gt;file2

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       In some early proposals, an explicit option <b>-n</b> was added to disable the historical behavior of  stripping
       NUL  characters  from  the  input. It was considered that automatically stripping NUL characters from the
       input was not correct functionality.  However, the removal of <b>-n</b> in a later proposal does not remove  the
       requirement  that <u>tr</u> correctly process NUL characters in its input stream. NUL characters can be stripped
       by using <u>tr</u> <b>-d</b> '\000'.

       Historical implementations of <u>tr</u> differ widely in syntax and behavior. For example, the BSD  version  has
       not  needed  the  bracket  characters  for  the  repetition sequence. The <u>tr</u> utility syntax is based more
       closely on the System V and XPG3 model while attempting to accommodate historical BSD implementations. In
       the case of the short <u>string2</u> padding, the decision was to unspecify the behavior and preserve  System  V
       and  XPG3  scripts,  which  might  find difficulty with the BSD method.  The assumption was made that BSD
       users of <u>tr</u> have to make accommodations to meet the syntax defined here. Since it is possible to use  the
       repetition  sequence  to  duplicate  the  desired behavior, whereas there is no simple way to achieve the
       System V method, this was the correct, if not desirable, approach.

       The use of octal values to specify  control  characters,  while  having  historical  precedents,  is  not
       portable.  The  introduction  of  escape  sequences  for  control characters should provide the necessary
       portability. It is recognized that this may cause some historical scripts to break.

       An early proposal included support for multi-character collating elements.   It  was  pointed  out  that,
       while  <u>tr</u>  does  employ some syntactical elements from REs, the aim of <u>tr</u> is quite different; ranges, for
       example, do not have a similar meaning (``any of the chars in the  range  matches'',  <u>versus</u>  ``translate
       each  character  in  the range to the output counterpart''). As a result, the previously included support
       for multi-character collating elements has been removed. What remains are  ranges  in  current  collation
       order (to support, for example, accented characters), character classes, and equivalence classes.

       In XPG3 the [:<u>class</u>:] and [=<u>equiv</u>=] conventions are shown with double brackets, as in RE syntax. However,
       <u>tr</u>  does  not  implement  RE principles; it just borrows part of the syntax.  Consequently, [:<u>class</u>:] and
       [=<u>equiv</u>=] should be regarded as syntactical elements on a par with [<u>x</u>*<u>n</u>], which  is  not  an  RE  bracket
       expression.

       The  standard  developers  will  consider  changes  to  <u>tr</u>  that allow it to translate characters between
       different character encodings, or they will consider providing a new utility to accomplish this.

       On historical System V systems, a range expression requires enclosing square-brackets, such as:

           tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]'

       However, BSD-based systems did not require the brackets, and  this  convention  is  used  here  to  avoid
       breaking large numbers of BSD scripts:

           tr a-z A-Z

       The  preceding System V script will continue to work because the brackets, treated as regular characters,
       are translated to themselves.  However, any System V script that relied on <b>"a‐z"</b> representing  the  three
       characters <b>'a'</b>, <b>'-'</b>, and <b>'z'</b> have to be rewritten as <b>"az-"</b>.

       The ISO POSIX‐2:1993 standard had a <b>-c</b> option that behaved similarly to the <b>-C</b> option, but did not supply
       functionality equivalent to the <b>-c</b> option specified in POSIX.1‐2008.

       The  earlier  version  also  said that octal sequences referred to collating elements and could be placed
       adjacent to each other to  specify  multi-byte  characters.  However,  it  was  noted  that  this  caused
       ambiguities  because  <u>tr</u>  would  not  be  able to tell whether adjacent octal sequences were intending to
       specify multi-byte characters or multiple single  byte  characters.  POSIX.1‐2008  specifies  that  octal
       sequences  always  refer  to  single  byte  binary  values when used to specify an endpoint of a range of
       collating elements.

       Earlier versions of this standard allowed for implementations with bytes other than eight bits, but  this
       has been modified in this version.
