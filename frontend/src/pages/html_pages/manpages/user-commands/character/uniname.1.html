</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       uniname - Name the characters in a Unicode text file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>uniname</b> <b>([option</b> <b>flags])</b> <b>(&lt;file</b> <b>name&gt;)</b>

       If no input file name is supplied, <u>uniname</u> reads from the standard input.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>uniname</u>  names  the  characters in a Unicode text file.  For each character, <u>uniname</u> defaults to printing
       the character offset, the byte offset, the hexadecimal UTF-32 character code, the encoding as a  sequence
       of  hex  byte  values,  the  glyph,  and the character's Unicode name. Command line flags allow undesired
       information to be suppressed.  Glyphs that do not display nicely, such as control characters and  spaces,
       are  not  displayed.   For  the Latin-1 control characters, whose official Unicode name is "control", the
       real name is given. Character and byte offsets both start from 0.

       Where a character does not have a unique Unicode name, as  is  the  case  with  Chinese  characters,  the
       character  is identified as "character in such-and-such a range".  However, if the character is a Chinese
       character listed in Nelson's dictionary, the Nelson number is supplied.

       By default, input is expected to be UTF-8. Native order UTF-32 may be specified via the command line flag
       If invalid UTF8 is encountered, an explanation is printed as to  why  it  is  invalid.   Except  when  in
       validation  mode,  surrogate  codepoints  are  reported  like proper characters although UTF-8 containing
       surrogates is technically invalid.  <u>-q.</u>

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       -A     Skip ASCII whitespace characters.

       -a     Skip ASCII characters.

       -B     Skip characters within the Basic Multilingual Plane.

       -b     Suppress printing of byte offset.

       -c     Suppress printing of character offset.

       -e     Suppress printing of encoding.

       -g     Suppress printing of glyph.

       -h     Print usage information.

       -l     Print line number.

       -n     Suppress printing of Unicode name.

       -p     Suppress printing of headers every screenfull.

       -q     Input is native order UTF-32.

       -r     Print Unicode range.  The ranges reported include both official Unicode ranges and the constructed
              language ranges within the Private Use  Areas  registered  with  the  Conscript  Unicode  Registry
              (<a href="http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/">http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/</a>).

       -s &lt;character offset&gt;
              Skip to specified character offset.

       -S &lt;byte offset&gt;
              Skip to specified byte offset. Note that even if the file consists of well-formed Unicode there is
              no  guarantee  that  the  byte sequence beginning at an arbitrary byte will be valid Unicode. This
              option is provided for use where other  programs  generate  only  byte  offsets  or  where  it  is
              necessary  to  skip  over damaged Unicode. In most circumstances use of a character offset will be
              more appropriate. If a byte offset is used, the character offsets shown are with  respect  to  the
              beginning of the section of the file examined rather than the beginning of the file.

       -u     Suppress printing of UTF32 code.

       -V     Validate  the input. In this case, nothing is done other than determine whether the input is valid
              UTF-8 Unicode. If it is, no output is produced and the program exits with  status  0.  If  invalid
              UTF-8  is  encountered,  the  program reports the location of the first invalid UTF-8 encountered,
              explains why it is invalid, and exits  with  status  1.  For  purposes  of  validation,  surrogate
              codepoints are considered invalid as per the Unicode standard.

       -v     Print version information.
