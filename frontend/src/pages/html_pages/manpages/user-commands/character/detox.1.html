       detox — clean up filenames

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>detox</b> [<b>-hnLrv</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>sequence</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>configfile</u>] [<b>--dry-run</b>] [<b>--special</b>] <u>file</u> <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>detox</b>  utility  renames  files  to  make them easier to work with.  It removes spaces and other such
       annoyances.  It'll also translate or cleanup Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1)  characters  encoded  in  8-bit  ASCII,
       Unicode characters encoded in UTF-8, and CGI escaped characters.

   <b>Sequences</b>
       <b>detox</b>  is  driven  by a configurable series of filters, called a sequence.  Sequences are covered in more
       detail in <u><a href="../man5/detoxrc.5.html">detoxrc</a></u>(5) and are discoverable with the <b>-L</b> option.  Some examples  of  default  sequences  are
       <b>iso8859_1</b> and <b>utf_8</b>.

   <b>Options</b>
       The main options:

       <b>-f</b> <u>configfile</u>
                   Use  <u>configfile</u> instead of the default configuration files for loading translation sequences.
                   No other config file will be parsed.

       <b>-h</b> <b>--help</b>   Display helpful information.

       <b>-L</b>          List the currently available sequences.  When paired with <b>-v</b> this option shows  what  filters
                   are used in each sequence and any properties applied to the filters.

       <b>-n</b> <b>--dry-run</b>
                   Doesn't actually change anything.  This implies the <b>-v</b> option.

       <b>-r</b>          Recurse into subdirectories.

       <b>-s</b> <u>sequence</u>
                   Use <u>sequence</u> instead of default.

       <b>--special</b>   Works on special files (including links).  Normally <b>detox</b> ignores these files.

       <b>-v</b>          Be verbose about which files are being renamed.

       <b>-V</b>          Show the current version of <b>detox</b>.

   <b>Deprecated</b> <b>Options</b>
       Deprecated  Options  are  options  that  were  available in earlier versions of <b>detox</b> but have lost their
       meaning and are being phased out.

       <b>--remove-trailing</b>
                   Removes _ and - after .'s in filenames.  This was first provided in the 0.9 series of  <b>detox</b>.
                   After  the  introduction  of  sequences,  it lost its meaning, as you could now determine the
                   properties of wipeup through a particular sequence's configuration.  It presently forces  all
                   instances  of  the wipeup filter to use remove trailing, regardless of what's actually in the
                   config files.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>detoxrc</u>        The system-wide detoxrc file.
       <u><a href="file:~/.detoxrc">~/.detoxrc</a></u>     A user's personal detoxrc.  Normally it extends the system-wide  detoxrc,  unless  <b>-f</b>  has
                      been specified, in which case, it is ignored.
       <u>iso8859_1.tbl</u>  The default ISO 8859-1 translation table.
       <u>unicode.tbl</u>    The default Unicode (UTF-8) translation table.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>detox</b> <b>-s</b> <u>iso8859_1</u> <b>-r</b> <b>-v</b> <b>-n</b> <u>/tmp/new_files</u>
                   Will  run the sequence <u>iso8859_1</u> recursively, listing any changes, without changing anything,
                   on the files of <u>/tmp/new_files</u>.

       <b>detox</b> <b>-f</b> <u>my_detoxrc</u> <b>-L</b> <b>-v</b>
                   Will list the sequences within <u>my_detoxrc</u>, showing their filters and options.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>detox</b> was originally designed to clean up files that I had received from friends which had  been  created
       using other operating systems.  It's trivial to create a filename with spaces, parenthesis, brackets, and
       ampersands  under some operating systems.  These have special meaning within FreeBSD and Linux, and cause
       problems when you go to access them.  I created <b>detox</b> to clean up these files.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>detox</b> was written by Doug Harple.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If, after the translation of a filename is finished, a file already exists with  that  same  name,  <b>detox</b>
       will  not  rename  the file.  This could cause a problem with the <b>max_length</b> filter, if it was imperative
       that the files be cut down to a certain length.

       Long options don't work under Solaris or Darwin.

       An error in the config file will cause a segfault as it's going to print the offending  word  within  the
       config file.
