</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>save</b> takes a snapshot of the current state of the specified files, stores them into corresponding archive
       files and assigns unique <u>version</u> <u>numbers</u> to the created versions.  The original files will by default  be
       removed  and  unlocked  in  order  to  support  a cooperative style of teamwork. Versions of files can be
       restored as regular files with the <b>retrv</b> command. Versions in archives are inalterable.

       An archive will be created the first time a file  is  saved  in  a  subdirectory  named  <u>AtFS</u>.  The  AtFS
       subdirectory must be present.  When an archive is created, save asks for a short description of the saved
       documents  purpose.  If  a subsequent version is saved, the user is prompted for a comment describing the
       modifications. The <b>save</b> command requires that the version history of a file that shall be saved is <u>locked</u>
       by the user issuing the command.  This is  to  prevent  different  developers  from  applying  concurrent
       updates to the same file and thereby invalidating the other developers' modifications. The only exception
       from  this rule is the first time a file is saved, which means that an archive has yet to be created. For
       more details on locking, see the ShapeTools Tutorial, <b><a href="../man1/retrv.1.html">retrv</a>(1)</b>, and <b><a href="../man1/vadm.1.html">vadm</a>(1)</b>.

       The <b>save</b> program assigns unique version ids to each evolving revision of a file. The version id is a pair
       of integers separated by a dot, identifying the major and minor revision (<u>&lt;generation&gt;.&lt;revision&gt;</u>)  of  a
       version.  Subsequent  invocations  of <b>save</b> increase the minor revision number, starting with version 1.0.
       The generation number is increased by invocations of <b>Save</b> (see below). There is no support  for  explicit
       branching.  The version control toolkit rather encourages a linear model of version evolution. Instead of
       branching, <b>save</b> allows to <u>insert</u> new versions into  old  generations  (see  description  of  <b>-fix</b>).  This
       allows,  for  example,  to  fix bugs in major revision N (version numbers <u>N.x</u>) which may be the currently
       operational release while development proceeds in generation N+1 (or N+n if you like).

       Before a file is saved it will be checked whether it has actually changed with respect to the  previously
       saved  version.  If  the  file  hasn't changed, the user will be asked if it should be saved anyway.  The
       command line option <b>-f</b> (or <b>-force</b>) overrides the prompting.

       The version control system supports a built-in basic status model for versions.  The  version  status  is
       intended  to  express  different  levels  of  quality,  and  aims  at  providing basic project management
       functionality.  State attributes of software objects can help to describe an object's current meaning  in
       the  development process (e.g.  <u>tested</u>, <u>incompletely</u> <u>implemented</u>, <u>submitted</u> <u>for</u> <u>evaluation</u>, or <u>shipped</u> <u>to</u>
       <u>customer</u>).

       A newly created version will by default be assigned the state <u>saved</u>. This status marks the  lowest  level
       of  quality,  suggesting  that  the  version  is  just  saved  for  possible  later  retrieval but may be
       inconsistent. Versions that meet higher quality standards (or are part of a release) should be marked  by
       appropriate status (see <b>vadm</b> <b>-promote</b>, <b>sbmt</b>, or <b>publ</b>).

       If  the  program  is  invoked  as  <b>Save</b> (that is with capital-S) a new major revision (<u>generation</u>) of the
       document history is created - provided the programmer issuing the command has the permission to do  this.
       This option is intended to support a development model where maintenance of an operational release can be
       performed parallel to <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>release</b> <b>(see</b> <b>-fix).</b>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       For  version  selection,  any  <u>version</u>  <u>binding</u>  <u>option</u>, as described on the <a href="../man1/vbind.1.html">vbind</a>(1) manual page, may be
       given. <u>Version</u> <u>bind</u> <u>directives</u> in brackets added to the filename are interpreted different to <a href="../man1/vbind.1.html">vbind</a>(1). A
       version number following the name will be treated as if the <u>-n</u> <u>(-setvnum)</u>  option  was  given  with  this
       version number as argument. Any other string in brackets will be taken as alias name (see <u>-alias</u> option).

       <b>-?,</b> <b>-help</b>
              print short information about usage of this command.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>-alias</b> <u>version</u> <u>alias</u>
              assign  a  version  alias  (a  symbolic  name)  to  the  new version. In more detail, an attribute
              <b>__</b><u>SymbolicName</u><b>__</b> is set to the value specified in <u>version</u> <u>alias</u>. The specified alias name must not
              be assigned to any other version within the same version history.  Alternatively to the -a option,
              the version alias may be given in brackets following the name of the file to be saved.  Check  the
              description of the -n option for an example of this notation.

       <b>-delta</b> Create delta for internal storage. This is the default.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>-force</b>
              force  a revision deposit (i.e. without asking), even if the busy version hasn't changed since the
              last time it was saved.

       <b>-fix</b> <u>generation</u> | <u>alias</u> | <u>date</u>
              append a new version after the most recent version within the referenced major revision level. The
              major revision level (called ``generation'') is either  referenced  <u>explicitly</u>,  by  specifying  a
              number,  or  <u>implicitly</u>, by specifying a version alias (e.g. a release name) or a date. The latter
              form is particularly useful for saving a fix that extends over more than one object.

              This option is intended to support maintenance of older releases while development proceeds at the
              logical end of the version chain. In order to insert a (fixed) version into an old generation, one
              must have a lock on the most recent version of that generation (<u>generation</u> <u>lock</u>). This  lock  must
              be  set with the <b>vadm</b> command. The <b>-fix</b> option is incompatible with <b>-setvnum</b>, <b>-newgen</b> and the <b>Save</b>
              command option.

       <b>-g,</b> <b>-newgen</b>
              create a major revision of the document. Major revisions are indicated by the first number in  the
              version-id (<u>generation</u>).  Only the archive administrator is allowed to create major revisions. The
              archive  administrator  is  the  user  who  owns  the AtFS subdirectory where the version archives
              reside. Use of this switch is identical to calling the program as <b>Save</b>.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>-lock</b>
              Keep the lock on the version history. The saved files will not be removed.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>-logmsg</b> <u>message</u>
              set <u>message</u> as descriptive note for all document versions that result from the invocation of <b>save</b>.
              When <u>message</u> starts with an at sign (@), it is interpreted as filename and the text  contained  in
              the  file  is set as descriptive note for all document versions that result from the invocation of
              <b>save</b>.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>-setvnum</b> <u>version</u> <u>number</u>
              set the version number of the newly created revision to <u>version</u>.  The <u>version</u> must be given in the
              format <u>&lt;generation&gt;.&lt;revision&gt;</u> where <u>generation</u> and <u>revision</u> are integers. Example:
              save -setvnum 4.3 mkattr.c
              The specified <u>version</u> must be greater than the highest previously assigned  version  number  in  a
              given object history. Only the archive administrator may set version numbers directly. The archive
              administrator  is  the  user  who  owns  the  AtFS subdirectory where the version archives reside.
              <b>-setvnum</b> is useful for keeping consistent version numbering across related,  physically  different
              object  repositories,  or for converting archive formats of other revision control systems to this
              toolkit (see: <b>rcs2atfs</b>). Alternatively to the -n option,  the  version  number  may  be  given  in
              brackets following the name of the file to be saved.  The command
              save mkattr.c[4.3]
              is interpreted the same way as the example above.

       <b>-nodelta</b>
              Suppress delta generation

       <b>-q,</b> <b>-quiet</b>
              quiet operation. No messages are printed on standard output.  If the busy version is unchanged, it
              will  not  be  saved unless <b>-f</b> is set. The user will not be prompted for a descriptive note. If no
              message or note is supplied with the command line (see options <b>-m</b> and  <b>-t</b>)  the  log  will  remain
              empty. This option is useful for batch operation.

       <b>-setattrs</b> <u>filename</u>
              read  names  and  values  of  user  defined attributes from the file <u>filename</u>.  The entries in the
              attribute file must have either of  the  formats  <u>NAME=VALUE</u>  or  <u>NAME+=VALUE</u>.  <u>NAME</u>  must  be  an
              alphanumeric  string (no spaces) immediately followed by the assignment operator. The value may be
              an arbitrary ASCII string with the exception of control-A and newline characters. There is exactly
              one attribute definition per line. The file's last character must be a newline character.

              If the first format (single equal symbol) is used, previously  assigned  values  of  user  defined
              attributes  are  <u>reset</u>  with  the values defined in the attribute file.  The second format (``plus
              equal'') allows to append additional values to an already existing attribute. If no attribute of a
              given name exists, it will be created.

              This way to attach attributes was introduced to allow quick automatic attachment of a large number
              of attributes to version objects. This interface to  the  attribute  setting  facility  is  mainly
              intended for tools that invoke <b>save</b>.

              If  the <b>-setattrs</b> option is omitted, <b>save</b> searches the environment for a variable <u>SVATTRS</u>. If this
              variable is absent, no user defined attributes will be assigned to the evolving versions.

       <b>-stdin</b> force <b>save</b> to read a descriptive note from stdin instead of forking an editor.  A  previously  set
              intent-message is printed.

       <b>-version</b>
              print the version of the program itself.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       All revisions of documents are stored in archive files in the subdirectory AtFS.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       With  the  <u>-g</u>  <u>(-newgen)</u> option given and an unchanged busy version, save ignores the users answer to the
       question, if the busy version should be saved anyway. It always assumes a positive  answer  and  goes  on
       with its saving procedure. You can avoid saving by interrupting (Ctrl-C) save during the next question if
       the unmodified version should be commented anyway.
