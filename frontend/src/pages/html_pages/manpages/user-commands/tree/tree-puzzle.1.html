</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tree-puzzle - Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tree-puzzle</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual page documents briefly the <b>tree-puzzle</b> command.  This manual page was written for the Debian
       GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       TREE-PUZZLE is the new name for the program previously known as PUZZLE!

       <b>tree-puzzle</b> is an interactive console program that implements  a  fast  tree  search  algorithm,  quartet
       puzzling,  that  allows  analysis  of large data sets and automatically assigns estimations of support to
       each internal branch. TREE-PUZZLE also computes pairwise maximum likelihood distances as well  as  branch
       lengths  for  user  specified trees. Branch lengths can also be calculated under the clock-assumption. In
       addition, TREE-PUZZLE offers a novel  method,  likelihood  mapping,  to  investigate  the  support  of  a
       hypothesized  internal branch without computing an overall tree and to visualize the phylogenetic content
       of a sequence alignment.

       There is also a paralellized version tree-ppuzzle available.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are no options. For usage please look at /usr/share/doc/tree-puzzle/tree-puzzle.pdf.
