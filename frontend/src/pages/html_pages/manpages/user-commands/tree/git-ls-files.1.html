</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command merges the file listing in the index with the actual working directory list, and shows
       different combinations of the two.

       Several flags can be used to determine which files are shown, and each file may be printed multiple times
       if there are multiple entries in the index or if multiple statuses are applicable for the relevant file
       selection options.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -c, --cached
           Show all files cached in Git’s index, i.e. all tracked files. (This is the default if no
           -c/-s/-d/-o/-u/-k/-m/--resolve-undo options are specified.)

       -d, --deleted
           Show files with an unstaged deletion

       -m, --modified
           Show files with an unstaged modification (note that an unstaged deletion also counts as an unstaged
           modification)

       -o, --others
           Show other (i.e. untracked) files in the output

       -i, --ignored
           Show only ignored files in the output. Must be used with either an explicit <u>-c</u> or <u>-o</u>. When showing
           files in the index (i.e. when used with <u>-c</u>), print only those files matching an exclude pattern. When
           showing "other" files (i.e. when used with <u>-o</u>), show only those matched by an exclude pattern.
           Standard ignore rules are not automatically activated; therefore, at least one of the <b>--exclude</b>*
           options is required.

       -s, --stage
           Show staged contents' mode bits, object name and stage number in the output.

       --directory
           If a whole directory is classified as "other", show just its name (with a trailing slash) and not its
           whole contents. Has no effect without -o/--others.

       --no-empty-directory
           Do not list empty directories. Has no effect without --directory.

       -u, --unmerged
           Show information about unmerged files in the output, but do not show any other tracked files (forces
           --stage, overrides --cached).

       -k, --killed
           Show untracked files on the filesystem that need to be removed due to file/directory conflicts for
           tracked files to be able to be written to the filesystem.

       --resolve-undo
           Show files having resolve-undo information in the index together with their resolve-undo information.
           (resolve-undo information is what is used to implement "git checkout -m $PATH", i.e. to recreate
           merge conflicts that were accidentally resolved)

       -z
           \0 line termination on output and do not quote filenames. See OUTPUT below for more information.

       --deduplicate
           When only filenames are shown, suppress duplicates that may come from having multiple stages during a
           merge, or giving <b>--deleted</b> and <b>--modified</b> option at the same time. When any of the <b>-t</b>, <b>--unmerged</b>, or
           <b>--stage</b> option is in use, this option has no effect.

       -x &lt;pattern&gt;, --exclude=&lt;pattern&gt;
           Skip untracked files matching pattern. Note that pattern is a shell wildcard pattern. See EXCLUDE
           PATTERNS below for more information.

       -X &lt;file&gt;, --exclude-from=&lt;file&gt;
           Read exclude patterns from &lt;file&gt;; 1 per line.

       --exclude-per-directory=&lt;file&gt;
           Read additional exclude patterns that apply only to the directory and its subdirectories in &lt;file&gt;.
           If you are trying to emulate the way Porcelain commands work, using the <b>--exclude-standard</b> option
           instead is easier and more thorough.

       --exclude-standard
           Add the standard Git exclusions: .git/info/exclude, .gitignore in each directory, and the user’s
           global exclusion file.

       --error-unmatch
           If any &lt;file&gt; does not appear in the index, treat this as an error (return 1).

       --with-tree=&lt;tree-ish&gt;
           When using --error-unmatch to expand the user supplied &lt;file&gt; (i.e. path pattern) arguments to paths,
           pretend that paths which were removed in the index since the named &lt;tree-ish&gt; are still present.
           Using this option with <b>-s</b> or <b>-u</b> options does not make any sense.

       -t
           Show status tags together with filenames. Note that for scripting purposes, <b><a href="../man1/git-status.1.html">git-status</a></b>(1) <b>--porcelain</b>
           and <b><a href="../man1/git-diff-files.1.html">git-diff-files</a></b>(1) <b>--name-status</b> are almost always superior alternatives; users should look at
           <b><a href="../man1/git-status.1.html">git-status</a></b>(1) <b>--short</b> or <b><a href="../man1/git-diff.1.html">git-diff</a></b>(1) <b>--name-status</b> for more user-friendly alternatives.

           This option provides a reason for showing each filename, in the form of a status tag (which is
           followed by a space and then the filename). The status tags are all single characters from the
           following list:

           H
               tracked file that is not either unmerged or skip-worktree

           S
               tracked file that is skip-worktree

           M
               tracked file that is unmerged

           R
               tracked file with unstaged removal/deletion

           C
               tracked file with unstaged modification/change

           K
               untracked paths which are part of file/directory conflicts which prevent checking out tracked
               files

           ?
               untracked file

           U
               file with resolve-undo information

       -v
           Similar to <b>-t</b>, but use lowercase letters for files that are marked as <u>assume</u> <u>unchanged</u> (see <b><a href="../man1/gitupdate-index.1.html">git-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man1/gitupdate-index.1.html">update-index</a></b>(1)).

       -f
           Similar to <b>-t</b>, but use lowercase letters for files that are marked as <u>fsmonitor</u> <u>valid</u> (see <b><a href="../man1/gitupdate-index.1.html">git-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man1/gitupdate-index.1.html">update-index</a></b>(1)).

       --full-name
           When run from a subdirectory, the command usually outputs paths relative to the current directory.
           This option forces paths to be output relative to the project top directory.

       --recurse-submodules
           Recursively calls ls-files on each active submodule in the repository. Currently there is only
           support for the --cached and --stage modes.

       --abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;]
           Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object lines, show the shortest prefix that is at
           least <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> hexdigits long that uniquely refers the object. Non default number of digits can be
           specified with --abbrev=&lt;n&gt;.

       --debug
           After each line that describes a file, add more data about its cache entry. This is intended to show
           as much information as possible for manual inspection; the exact format may change at any time.

       --eol
           Show &lt;eolinfo&gt; and &lt;eolattr&gt; of files. &lt;eolinfo&gt; is the file content identification used by Git when
           the "text" attribute is "auto" (or not set and core.autocrlf is not false). &lt;eolinfo&gt; is either
           "-text", "none", "lf", "crlf", "mixed" or "".

           "" means the file is not a regular file, it is not in the index or not accessible in the working
           tree.

           &lt;eolattr&gt; is the attribute that is used when checking out or committing, it is either "", "-text",
           "text", "text=auto", "text eol=lf", "text eol=crlf". Since Git 2.10 "text=auto eol=lf" and "text=auto
           eol=crlf" are supported.

           Both the &lt;eolinfo&gt; in the index ("i/&lt;eolinfo&gt;") and in the working tree ("w/&lt;eolinfo&gt;") are shown for
           regular files, followed by the ("attr/&lt;eolattr&gt;").

       --sparse
           If the index is sparse, show the sparse directories without expanding to the contained files. Sparse
           directories will be shown with a trailing slash, such as "x/" for a sparse directory "x".

       --format=&lt;format&gt;
           A string that interpolates %(<b>fieldname</b>) from the result being shown. It also interpolates %% to %,
           and %xXX where <b>XX</b> are hex digits interpolates to character with hex code <b>XX</b>; for example %x00
           interpolates to \0 (NUL), %x09 to \t (TAB) and %x0a to \n (LF). --format cannot be combined with <b>-s</b>,
           <b>-o</b>, <b>-k</b>, <b>-t</b>, <b>--resolve-undo</b> and <b>--eol</b>.

       --
           Do not interpret any more arguments as options.

       &lt;file&gt;
           Files to show. If no files are given all files which match the other specified criteria are shown.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>ls-files</u> just outputs the filenames unless <b>--stage</b> is specified in which case it outputs:

           [&lt;tag&gt; ]&lt;mode&gt; &lt;object&gt; &lt;stage&gt; &lt;file&gt;

       <u>git</u> <u>ls-files</u> <u>--eol</u> will show i/&lt;eolinfo&gt;&lt;SPACES&gt;w/&lt;eolinfo&gt;&lt;SPACES&gt;attr/&lt;eolattr&gt;&lt;SPACE*&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;file&gt;

       <u>git</u> <u>ls-files</u> <u>--unmerged</u> and <u>git</u> <u>ls-files</u> <u>--stage</u> can be used to examine detailed information on unmerged
       paths.

       For an unmerged path, instead of recording a single mode/SHA-1 pair, the index records up to three such
       pairs; one from tree O in stage 1, A in stage 2, and B in stage 3. This information can be used by the
       user (or the porcelain) to see what should eventually be recorded at the path. (see <b><a href="../man1/git-read-tree.1.html">git-read-tree</a></b>(1) for
       more information on state)

       Without the <b>-z</b> option, pathnames with "unusual" characters are quoted as explained for the configuration
       variable <b>core.quotePath</b> (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)). Using <b>-z</b> the filename is output verbatim and the line is
       terminated by a NUL byte.

       It is possible to print in a custom format by using the <b>--format</b> option, which is able to interpolate
       different fields using a %(<b>fieldname</b>) notation. For example, if you only care about the "objectname" and
       "path" fields, you can execute with a specific "--format" like

           git ls-files --format='%(objectname) %(path)'

</pre><h4><b>FIELD</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       The way each path is shown can be customized by using the <b>--format=</b><u>&lt;format&gt;</u> option, where the
       %(fieldname) in the &lt;format&gt; string for various aspects of the index entry are interpolated. The
       following "fieldname" are understood:

       objectmode
           The mode of the file which is recorded in the index.

       objecttype
           The object type of the file which is recorded in the index.

       objectname
           The name of the file which is recorded in the index.

       objectsize[:padded]
           The object size of the file which is recorded in the index ("-" if the object is a <b>commit</b> or <b>tree</b>).
           It also supports a padded format of size with "%(objectsize:padded)".

       stage
           The stage of the file which is recorded in the index.

       eolinfo:index, eolinfo:worktree
           The &lt;eolinfo&gt; (see the description of the <b>--eol</b> option) of the contents in the index or in the
           worktree for the path.

       eolattr
           The &lt;eolattr&gt; (see the description of the <b>--eol</b> option) that applies to the path.

       path
           The pathname of the file which is recorded in the index.

</pre><h4><b>EXCLUDE</b> <b>PATTERNS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>ls-files</u> can use a list of "exclude patterns" when traversing the directory tree and finding files to
       show when the flags --others or --ignored are specified. <b><a href="../man5/gitignore.5.html">gitignore</a></b>(5) specifies the format of exclude
       patterns.

       These exclude patterns can be specified from the following places, in order:

        1. The command-line flag --exclude=&lt;pattern&gt; specifies a single pattern. Patterns are ordered in the
           same order they appear in the command line.

        2. The command-line flag --exclude-from=&lt;file&gt; specifies a file containing a list of patterns. Patterns
           are ordered in the same order they appear in the file.

        3. The command-line flag --exclude-per-directory=&lt;name&gt; specifies a name of the file in each directory
           <u>git</u> <u>ls-files</u> examines, normally <b>.gitignore</b>. Files in deeper directories take precedence. Patterns are
           ordered in the same order they appear in the files.

       A pattern specified on the command line with --exclude or read from the file specified with
       --exclude-from is relative to the top of the directory tree. A pattern read from a file specified by
       --exclude-per-directory is relative to the directory that the pattern file appears in.

       Generally, you should be able to use <b>--exclude-standard</b> when you want the exclude rules applied the same
       way as what Porcelain commands do. To emulate what <b>--exclude-standard</b> specifies, you can give
       <b>--exclude-per-directory=.gitignore</b>, and then specify:

        1. The file specified by the <b>core.excludesfile</b> configuration variable, if exists, or the
           <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore</b> file.

        2. The <b>$GIT_DIR/info/exclude</b> file.

       via the <b>--exclude-from=</b> option.
