       cargo-tree — Display a tree visualization of a dependency graph

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cargo</b> <b>tree</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command will display a tree of dependencies to the terminal. An example of a simple project that
       depends on the “rand” package:

           myproject v0.1.0 (/myproject)
           `-- rand v0.7.3
               |-- getrandom v0.1.14
               |   |-- cfg-if v0.1.10
               |   `-- libc v0.2.68
               |-- libc v0.2.68 (*)
               |-- rand_chacha v0.2.2
               |   |-- ppv-lite86 v0.2.6
               |   `-- rand_core v0.5.1
               |       `-- getrandom v0.1.14 (*)
               `-- rand_core v0.5.1 (*)
           [build-dependencies]
           `-- cc v1.0.50

       Packages marked with <b>(*)</b> have been “de-duplicated”. The dependencies for the package have already been
       shown elsewhere in the graph, and so are not repeated. Use the <b>--no-dedupe</b> option to repeat the
       duplicates.

       The <b>-e</b> flag can be used to select the dependency kinds to display. The “features” kind changes the output
       to display the features enabled by each dependency. For example, <b>cargo</b> <b>tree</b> <b>-e</b> <b>features</b>:

           myproject v0.1.0 (/myproject)
           `-- log feature "serde"
               `-- log v0.4.8
                   |-- serde v1.0.106
                   `-- cfg-if feature "default"
                       `-- cfg-if v0.1.10

       In this tree, <b>myproject</b> depends on <b>log</b> with the <b>serde</b> feature. <b>log</b> in turn depends on <b>cfg-if</b> with
       “default” features. When using <b>-e</b> <b>features</b> it can be helpful to use <b>-i</b> flag to show how the features flow
       into a package. See the examples below for more detail.

   <b>Feature</b> <b>Unification</b>
       This command shows a graph much closer to a feature-unified graph Cargo will build, rather than what you
       list in <b>Cargo.toml</b>. For instance, if you specify the same dependency in both <b>[dependencies]</b> and
       <b>[dev-dependencies]</b> but with different features on. This command may merge all features and show a <b>(*)</b> on
       one of the dependency to indicate the duplicate.

       As a result, for a mostly equivalent overview of what <b>cargo</b> <b>build</b> does, <b>cargo</b> <b>tree</b> <b>-e</b> <b>normal,build</b> is
       pretty close; for a mostly equivalent overview of what <b>cargo</b> <b>test</b> does, <b>cargo</b> <b>tree</b> is pretty close.
       However, it doesn’t guarantee the exact equivalence to what Cargo is going to build, since a compilation
       is complex and depends on lots of different factors.

       To learn more about feature unification, check out this <u>dedicated</u> <u>section</u>
       &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#feature-unification&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Tree</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-i</b> <u>spec</u>, <b>--invert</b> <u>spec</u>
           Show the reverse dependencies for the given package. This flag will invert the tree and display the
           packages that depend on the given package.

           Note that in a workspace, by default it will only display the package’s reverse dependencies inside
           the tree of the workspace member in the current directory. The <b>--workspace</b> flag can be used to extend
           it so that it will show the package’s reverse dependencies across the entire workspace. The <b>-p</b> flag
           can be used to display the package’s reverse dependencies only with the subtree of the package given
           to <b>-p</b>.

       <b>--prune</b> <u>spec</u>
           Prune the given package from the display of the dependency tree.

       <b>--depth</b> <u>depth</u>
           Maximum display depth of the dependency tree. A depth of 1 displays the direct dependencies, for
           example.

       <b>--no-dedupe</b>
           Do not de-duplicate repeated dependencies. Usually, when a package has already displayed its
           dependencies, further occurrences will not re-display its dependencies, and will include a <b>(*)</b> to
           indicate it has already been shown. This flag will cause those duplicates to be repeated.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--duplicates</b>
           Show only dependencies which come in multiple versions (implies <b>--invert</b>). When used with the <b>-p</b>
           flag, only shows duplicates within the subtree of the given package.

           It can be beneficial for build times and executable sizes to avoid building that same package
           multiple times. This flag can help identify the offending packages. You can then investigate if the
           package that depends on the duplicate with the older version can be updated to the newer version so
           that only one instance is built.

       <b>-e</b> <u>kinds</u>, <b>--edges</b> <u>kinds</u>
           The dependency kinds to display. Takes a comma separated list of values:

           •  <b>all</b> — Show all edge kinds.

           •  <b>normal</b> — Show normal dependencies.

           •  <b>build</b> — Show build dependencies.

           •  <b>dev</b> — Show development dependencies.

           •  <b>features</b> — Show features enabled by each dependency. If this is the only kind given, then it will
               automatically include the other dependency kinds.

           •  <b>no-normal</b> — Do not include normal dependencies.

           •  <b>no-build</b> — Do not include build dependencies.

           •  <b>no-dev</b> — Do not include development dependencies.

           •  <b>no-proc-macro</b> — Do not include procedural macro dependencies.

           The <b>normal</b>, <b>build</b>, <b>dev</b>, and <b>all</b> dependency kinds cannot be mixed with <b>no-normal</b>, <b>no-build</b>, or <b>no-dev</b>
           dependency kinds.

           The default is <b>normal,build,dev</b>.

       <b>--target</b> <u>triple</u>
           Filter dependencies matching the given <u>target</u> <u>triple</u>
           &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/appendix/glossary.html#target&gt;. The default is the host platform.
           Use the value <b>all</b> to include <u>all</u> targets.

   <b>Tree</b> <b>Formatting</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--charset</b> <u>charset</u>
           Chooses the character set to use for the tree. Valid values are “utf8” or “ascii”. Default is “utf8”.

       <b>-f</b> <u>format</u>, <b>--format</b> <u>format</u>
           Set the format string for each package. The default is “{p}”.

           This is an arbitrary string which will be used to display each package. The following strings will be
           replaced with the corresponding value:

           •  <b>{p}</b> — The package name.

           •  <b>{l}</b> — The package license.

           •  <b>{r}</b> — The package repository URL.

           •  <b>{f}</b> — Comma-separated list of package features that are enabled.

           •  <b>{lib}</b> — The name, as used in a <b>use</b> statement, of the package’s library.

       <b>--prefix</b> <u>prefix</u>
           Sets how each line is displayed. The <u>prefix</u> value can be one of:

           •  <b>indent</b> (default) — Shows each line indented as a tree.

           •  <b>depth</b> — Show as a list, with the numeric depth printed before each entry.

           •  <b>none</b> — Show as a flat list.

   <b>Package</b> <b>Selection</b>
       By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected depend on the selected
       manifest file (based on the current working directory if <b>--manifest-path</b> is not given). If the manifest
       is the root of a workspace then the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package
       defined by the manifest will be selected.

       The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the <b>workspace.default-members</b> key in the
       root manifest. If this is not set, a virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to
       passing <b>--workspace</b>), and a non-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.

       <b>-p</b> <u>spec</u>…, <b>--package</b> <u>spec</u>…
           Display only the specified packages. See <b><a href="../man1/cargo-pkgid.1.html">cargo-pkgid</a></b>(1) for the SPEC format. This flag may be
           specified multiple times and supports common Unix glob patterns like <b>*</b>, <b>?</b> and <b>[]</b>. However, to avoid
           your shell accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles them, you must use single quotes
           or double quotes around each pattern.

       <b>--workspace</b>
           Display all members in the workspace.

       <b>--exclude</b> <u>SPEC</u>…
           Exclude the specified packages. Must be used in conjunction with the <b>--workspace</b> flag. This flag may
           be specified multiple times and supports common Unix glob patterns like <b>*</b>, <b>?</b> and <b>[]</b>. However, to
           avoid your shell accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles them, you must use single
           quotes or double quotes around each pattern.

   <b>Manifest</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--manifest-path</b> <u>path</u>
           Path to the <b>Cargo.toml</b> file. By default, Cargo searches for the <b>Cargo.toml</b> file in the current
           directory or any parent directory.

       <b>--frozen</b>, <b>--locked</b>
           Either of these flags requires that the <b>Cargo.lock</b> file is up-to-date. If the lock file is missing,
           or it needs to be updated, Cargo will exit with an error. The <b>--frozen</b> flag also prevents Cargo from
           attempting to access the network to determine if it is out-of-date.

           These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the <b>Cargo.lock</b> file is up-to-date
           (such as a CI build) or want to avoid network access.

       <b>--offline</b>
           Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without this flag, Cargo will stop with an
           error if it needs to access the network and the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than online mode. Cargo will restrict
           itself to crates that are downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as indicated in
           the local copy of the index. See the <b><a href="../man1/cargo-fetch.1.html">cargo-fetch</a></b>(1) command to download dependencies before going
           offline.

           May also be specified with the <b>net.offline</b> <u>config</u> <u>value</u>
           &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html&gt;.

   <b>Feature</b> <b>Selection</b>
       The feature flags allow you to control which features are enabled. When no feature options are given, the
       <b>default</b> feature is activated for every selected package.

       See <u>the</u> <u>features</u> <u>documentation</u>
       &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#command-line-feature-options&gt; for more details.

       <b>-F</b> <u>features</u>, <b>--features</b> <u>features</u>
           Space or comma separated list of features to activate. Features of workspace members may be enabled
           with <b>package-name/feature-name</b> syntax. This flag may be specified multiple times, which enables all
           specified features.

       <b>--all-features</b>
           Activate all available features of all selected packages.

       <b>--no-default-features</b>
           Do not activate the <b>default</b> feature of the selected packages.

   <b>Display</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose” output which includes extra output such
           as dependency warnings and build script output. May also be specified with the <b>term.verbose</b> <u>config</u>
           <u>value</u> &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html&gt;.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Do not print cargo log messages. May also be specified with the <b>term.quiet</b> <u>config</u> <u>value</u>
           &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html&gt;.

       <b>--color</b> <u>when</u>
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           •  <b>auto</b> (default): Automatically detect if color support is available on the terminal.

           •  <b>always</b>: Always display colors.

           •  <b>never</b>: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the <b>term.color</b> <u>config</u> <u>value</u>
           &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html&gt;.

   <b>Common</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>+</b><u>toolchain</u>
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to <b>cargo</b> begins with <b>+</b>, it will be
           interpreted as a rustup toolchain name (such as <b>+stable</b> or <b>+nightly</b>). See the <u>rustup</u> <u>documentation</u>
           &lt;https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html&gt; for more information about how toolchain
           overrides work.

       <b>--config</b> <u>KEY=VALUE</u> or <u>PATH</u>
           Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in TOML syntax of <b>KEY=VALUE</b>, or
           provided as a path to an extra configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See the
           <u>command-line</u> <u>overrides</u> <u>section</u>
           &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides&gt; for more information.

       <b>-C</b> <u>PATH</u>
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified operations. This affects things
           like where cargo looks by default for the project manifest (<b>Cargo.toml</b>), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering <b>.cargo/config.toml</b>, for example. This option must appear before the command
           name, for example <b>cargo</b> <b>-C</b> <b>path/to/my-project</b> <b>build</b>.

           This option is only available on the <u>nightly</u> <u>channel</u>
           &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html&gt; and requires the <b>-Z</b> <b>unstable-options</b>
           flag to enable (see <u>#10098</u> &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10098&gt;).

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Prints help information.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>flag</u>
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run <b>cargo</b> <b>-Z</b> <b>help</b> for details.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       See <u>the</u> <u>reference</u> &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html&gt; for details on
       environment variables that Cargo reads.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       •  <b>0</b>: Cargo succeeded.

       •  <b>101</b>: Cargo failed to complete.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. Display the tree for the package in the current directory:

               cargo tree

        2. Display all the packages that depend on the <b>syn</b> package:

               cargo tree -i syn

        3. Show the features enabled on each package:

               cargo tree --format "{p} {f}"

        4. Show all packages that are built multiple times. This can happen if multiple semver-incompatible
           versions appear in the tree (like 1.0.0 and 2.0.0).

               cargo tree -d

        5. Explain why features are enabled for the <b>syn</b> package:

               cargo tree -e features -i syn

           The <b>-e</b> <b>features</b> flag is used to show features. The <b>-i</b> flag is used to invert the graph so that it
           displays the packages that depend on <b>syn</b>. An example of what this would display:

               syn v1.0.17
               |-- syn feature "clone-impls"
               |   `-- syn feature "default"
               |       `-- rustversion v1.0.2
               |           `-- rustversion feature "default"
               |               `-- myproject v0.1.0 (/myproject)
               |                   `-- myproject feature "default" (command-line)
               |-- syn feature "default" (*)
               |-- syn feature "derive"
               |   `-- syn feature "default" (*)
               |-- syn feature "full"
               |   `-- rustversion v1.0.2 (*)
               |-- syn feature "parsing"
               |   `-- syn feature "default" (*)
               |-- syn feature "printing"
               |   `-- syn feature "default" (*)
               |-- syn feature "proc-macro"
               |   `-- syn feature "default" (*)
               `-- syn feature "quote"
                   |-- syn feature "printing" (*)
                   `-- syn feature "proc-macro" (*)

           To read this graph, you can follow the chain for each feature from the root to see why it is
           included. For example, the “full” feature is added by the <b>rustversion</b> crate which is included from
           <b>myproject</b> (with the default features), and <b>myproject</b> is the package selected on the command-line. All
           of the other <b>syn</b> features are added by the “default” feature (“quote” is added by “printing” and
           “proc-macro”, both of which are default features).

           If you’re having difficulty cross-referencing the de-duplicated <b>(*)</b> entries, try with the <b>--no-dedupe</b>
           flag to get the full output.
