       sumtrees - Phylogenetic Tree Summarization and Annotation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sumtrees</b> <u>[-i</u> <u>FORMAT]</u> <u>[-b</u> <u>BURNIN]</u> <u>[--force-rooted]</u> <u>[--force-unrooted]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       SumTrees  is  a  program to summarize non-parameteric bootstrap or Bayesian posterior probability support
       for splits or clades on phylogenetic trees.

       The basis of the support assessment is typically given by a set  of  non-parametric  bootstrap  replicate
       tree  samples  produced  by programs such as GARLI or RAxML, or by a set of MCMC tree samples produced by
       programs such as Mr. Bayes or BEAST. The proportion of trees out of the samples  in  which  a  particular
       split  is  found  is  taken  to  be the degree of support for that split as indicated by the samples. The
       samples that are the basis of the support can be distributed across multiple files, and a burn-in  option
       allows  for  an  initial  number  of  trees in each file to be excluded from the analysis if they are not
       considered to be drawn from the true support distribution.

       Summarizations collections of trees, e.g., MCMC samples from  a  posterior  distribution,  non-parametric
       bootstrap  replicates,  mapping posterior probability, support, or frequency that splits/clades are found
       in the source set of trees onto a target tree.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Source</b> <b>Options:</b>
       TREE-FILEPATH
              Source(s) of trees to summarize. At least one valid source of trees must be provided. Use  '-'  to
              specify  reading  from  standard  input  (note  that  this  requires  the  input file format to be
              explicitly set using the '--source-format' option).

       <b>-i</b> FORMAT, <b>--input-format</b> FORMAT, <b>--source-format</b> FORMAT
              Format of all input trees (defaults to handling either NEXUS or NEWICK through inspection;  it  is
              more efficient to explicitly specify the format if it is known).

       <b>-b</b> BURNIN, <b>--burnin</b> BURNIN
              Number of trees to skip from the beginning of *each* tree file when counting support (default: 0).

       <b>--force-rooted</b>, <b>--rooted</b>
              Treat source trees as rooted.

       <b>--force-unrooted</b>, <b>--unrooted</b>
              Treat source trees as unrooted.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--ultrametricity-precision</b>, <b>--branch-length-epsilon</b>
              Precision  to  use  when  validating  ultrametricity  (default:  1e-05;  specify  '0'  to  disable
              validation).

       <b>--weighted-trees</b>
              Use weights of trees (as indicated by '[&amp;W m/n]' comment token) to weight contribution  of  splits
              found on each tree to overall split frequencies.

       <b>--preserve-underscores</b>
              Do  not  convert  unprotected  (unquoted)  underscores  to spaces when reading NEXUS/NEWICK format
              trees.

       <b>--taxon-name-filepath</b> FILEPATH
              Path to file listing all the taxon names or labels that will be found across  the  entire  set  of
              source  trees.  This  file  should be a plain text file with a single name list on each line. This
              file is only read when multiprocessing ('-M' or '-m') is requested. When multiprocessing using the
              '-M' or '-m' options, all taxon names need to be defined in advance of any actual  tree  analysis.
              By  default  this  is  done  by reading the first tree in the first tree source and extracting the
              taxon names. At best, this is, inefficient, as it involves an extraneous reading of the  tree.  At
              worst,  this  can  be  erroneous,  if  the  first  tree  does not contain all the taxa. Explicitly
              providing the taxon names via this option can avoid these issues.

   <b>Target</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>Topology</b> <b>Options:</b>
       <b>-t</b> FILE, <b>--target-tree-filepath</b> FILE
              Summarize support and other information from the source trees to topology or topologies  given  by
              the  tree(s)  described  in  FILE. If no use-specified target topologies are given, then a summary
              topology will be used as the target. Use the '-s' or '--summary-target' to  specify  the  type  of
              summary tree to use.

       <b>-s</b> SUMMARY-TYPE, <b>--summary-target</b> SUMMARY-TYPE
              Construct  and  summarize  support  and  other  information  from  the  source trees to one of the
              following summary topologies: - 'consensus'

       A consensus tree. The minimum frequency
              threshold of clades to be included can be specified using the '-f'  or  '--min-clade-freq'  flags.
              This  is  the  DEFAULT  if  a  user-  specified  target  tree  is  not  given  through the '-t' or
              '--target-tree-filepath' options.

       - 'mcct'
              The maximum clade credibility tree. The tree from the source set that maximizes the  *product*  of
              clade posterior probabilities.

       - 'msct'
              The  maximum  clade credibility tree. The tree from the source set that maximizes the *product* of
              clade posterior probabilities.

   <b>Target</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>Supplemental</b> <b>Options:</b>
       <b>-f</b> #.##, <b>--min-consensus-freq</b> #.##, <b>--min-freq</b> #.##, <b>--min-clade-freq</b> #.##
              If using a  consensus  tree  summarization  strategy,  then  this  is  the  minimum  frequency  or
              probability for a clade or a split to be included in the resulting tree (default: &gt; 0.5).

       <b>--allow-unknown-target-tree-taxa</b>
              Do  not  fail with error if target tree(s) have taxa not previously encountered in source trees or
              defined in the taxon discovery file.

   <b>Target</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>Rooting</b> <b>Options:</b>
       <b>--root-target-at-outgroup</b> TAXON-LABEL
              Root target tree(s) using specified taxon as outgroup.

       <b>--root-target-at-midpoint</b>
              Root target tree(s) at midpoint.

       <b>--set-outgroup</b> TAXON-LABEL
              Rotate the target trees such the  specified  taxon  is  in  the  outgroup  position,  but  do  not
              explicitly change the target tree rooting.

   <b>Target</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>Options:</b>
       <b>-e</b> STRATEGY, <b>--set-edges</b> STRATEGY, <b>--edges</b> STRATEGY
              Set the edge lengths of the target or summary trees based on the specified summarization STRATEGY:
              - 'mean-length'

       Edge lengths will be set to the mean of the
              lengths of the corresponding split or clade in the source trees.

       - 'median-length'
              Edge lengths will be set to the median of the

       lengths of the corresponding split or clade in
              the source trees.

       - 'mean-age'
              Edge  lengths will be adjusted so that the age of subtended nodes will be equal to the mean age of
              the corresponding split or clade in the source trees. Source trees will need to to be  ultrametric
              for this option.

       - 'median-age'
              Edge  lengths  will be adjusted so that the age of subtended nodes will be equal to the median age
              of the corresponding split or clade in  the  source  trees.  Source  trees  will  need  to  to  be
              ultrametric for this option.

       - support
              Edge lengths will be set to the support value for the split represented by the edge.

       - 'keep'
              Do not change the existing edge lengths. This is the DEFAULT if target tree(s) are sourced from an
              external file using the '-t' or '--targettree-filepath' option

       - 'clear'
              Edge lengths will be cleared from the target trees if they are present.

       Note the default settings varies according to the
              following, in order of preference: (1) If target trees are specified using the '-t' or

       '--target-tree-filepath' option, then the default edge
              summarization strategy is: 'keep'.

       (2) If target trees are not specified, but the
              '--summarize-node-ages'  option  is  specified,  then  the default edge summarization strategy is:
              'mean-age'.

       (3) If no target trees are specified and the
              node ages are NOT specified to be summarized, then the default  edge  summarization  strategy  is:
              'mean-length'.

       <b>--force-minimum-edge-length</b> FORCE_MINIMUM_EDGE_LENGTH
              (If setting edge lengths) force all edges to be at least this length.

       <b>--collapse-negative-edges</b>
              (If  setting  edge  lengths) force parent node ages to be at least as old as its oldest child when
              summarizing node ages.

       <b>-l</b> {support,keep,clear}, <b>--labels</b> {support,keep,clear}
              Set the node labels of the summary or target tree(s): - 'support'

       Node labels will be set to the support value for
              the clade represented by the node. This is the DEFAULT.

       - 'keep'
              Do not change the existing node labels.

       - 'clear'
              Node labels will be cleared from the target trees if they are present.

       <b>--suppress-annotations</b>, <b>--no-annotations</b>
              Do NOT annotate nodes and edges  with  any  summarization  information  metadata  such  as.support
