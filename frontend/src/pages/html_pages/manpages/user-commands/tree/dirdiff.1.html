</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Dirdiff</b> is a graphical tool for displaying the differences between directory trees  (up  to  5)  and  for
       merging changes from one tree into another.

       At startup, <b>dirdiff</b> displays a main window with a list of the files that are different between the trees.
       Colored  squares  are  used  to  indicate  the relative ages of the versions.  Files are like leaves on a
       deciduous tree: the newest ones are green, and then they turn yellow, orange, and red as they get  older.
       Missing files are black, and directories are white.

       To  see  the  differences between two versions of a file, double-click on the file name.  By default, the
       first and last versions are compared, but this can be changed using the <u>Diff</u> menu in the main window.  In
       the differences window, there are checkboxes to the left of all the sections which  are  different.   You
       can use button 1 to select an individual checkbox, or shift-button 1 or button 3 to select a whole group.
       Selecting a line means that you are asking for that change to be made when you update either of the files
       using the Merge menu.  The line will be removed if it is already present or added if it is not present.

       To  copy  from one tree to another, click on the file name and select the appropriate copy operation from
       the <u>Copy</u> menu of the main window.

       Selecting <u>Make</u> <u>patch</u> from the <u>File</u> menu of the main window produces a file describing the changes between
       the files that can be applied by the patch tool.  You can edit the patch before saving, and may  wish  to
       add  explanatory  text, instructions, or patch <u>Prereq</u> lines at the beginning.  To save the patch, enter a
       filename in the patch window relative to the current directory, and choose <u>Save.</u>  This  will  also  close
       the window.

       If  you  are  sending  out patches, then the <u>from</u> directory should be the original version of the source.
       Try to make sure that the two files have the same number of leading directories.  See  the  <a href="../man1/patch.1.html">patch</a>(1)  man
       page for more information.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Dirdiff</b> needs to be able to load the <u>libfilecmp.so.0.0</u> shared library for the -r or -t flags to work.
