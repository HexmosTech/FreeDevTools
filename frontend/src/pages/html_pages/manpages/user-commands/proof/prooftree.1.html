</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       prooftree - proof-tree display for Proof General

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>prooftree</b> [<u>Options...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Prooftree</b>  visualizes  proof  trees during proof development with <b>Proof</b> <b>General</b>.  Currently it only works
       for <b>Coq</b>, though adding support for other proof assistants should be relatively easy.

       To start a proof-tree display, hit the <b>Prooftree</b> icon in the <b>Proof</b> <b>General</b> tool-bar or  select  the  menu
       entry  <u>Proof-General</u>  -&gt;  <u>Start/Stop</u>  <u>Prooftree</u>  or type <u>C-c</u> <u>C-d</u> (which runs <u>proof-tree-external-display-</u>
       <u>toggle</u>).  Inside a proof, this will immediately start a proof-tree display for the current proof. Outside
       a proof, <b>Proof</b> <b>General</b> remembers to start the proof-tree display for the next proof.

       Under normal circumstances <b>Prooftree</b> is started by  <b>Proof</b>  <b>General</b>  as  an  <b>Emacs</b>  subprocess.  The  user
       interacts  with <b>Prooftree</b> only through the graphical user interface. A substantial part of the proof-tree
       visualization task is done by <b>Proof</b> <b>General</b>.  Therefore not only the <b>Prooftree</b> command line arguments but
       also other aspects can only be configured inside <b>Proof</b> <b>General</b>, see <b>Proof</b> <b>General</b> <b>Customization</b> below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -help  Print synopsis and exit.

       -config
              Open the configuration dialog on startup (if you want to change the configuration without starting
              <b>Proof</b> <b>General</b>).

       -geometry <u>spec</u>
              Sets the X geometry of the main window.  <u>spec</u>  is  a  standard  X  geometry  string  in  the  form
              <u>xpos</u>x<u>ypos</u>[+<u>xoff</u>[+<u>yoff</u>]].

       -tee <u>file</u>
              Write all input to <u>file</u> (usually for debugging purposes).

       -debug Provide more details on errors.

       -help-dialog
              Open the help dialog on startup. Mainly useful for proofreading the help text.

</pre><h4><b>MAIN</b> <b>PROOF</b> <b>DISPLAY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Prooftree</b>  opens  one  window  for  each proof that it is requested to display.  This window contains the
       proof-tree graph and a small display for sequents and proof commands.

   <b>Colors</b>
       The branches in the proof-tree graph are colored  according  to  their  state.   <b>Prooftree</b>  distinguishes
       between the following states.

       current (blue by default)
              The current branch is the branch from the root of the proof tree to the current goal.

       unproven (default foreground color)
              A branch is unproven if it contains open proof goals.

       proved incomplete (cyan by default)
              An  incompletely  proved branch has its proof finished, but some of the existential variables that
              have been introduced in this branch are not (yet) instantiated.

       proved partially (dark green by default)
              In a partially proved branch all existential variables of the branch itself are instantiated,  but
              some of those instantiations contain existential variables that are not (yet) instantiated.

       proved complete (green by default)
              A  branch  is  proved  complete  if all its existential variables are instantiated with terms that
              themselves do not contain any existential variables.

       cheated (red by default)
              A cheated branch contains a cheating proof command, such as <u>admit</u>

       The colors as well as many other <b>Prooftree</b> parameters can  be  changed  in  the  <b>Prooftree</b>  <b>Configuration</b>
       <b>Dialog</b> (see below).

   <b>Navigation</b>
       When  the  proof  tree grows large one can navigate by a variety of means. In addition to scroll bars and
       the usual keys one can move the proof tree by dragging with mouse button 1 pressed. By default,  dragging
       moves  the  viewport  (i.e.,  the proof tree underneath moves in the opposite direction). After setting a
       negative value for <u>Drag</u> <u>acceleration</u> in the <b>Prooftree</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Dialog</b>, dragging will move the  proof
       tree instead (i.e, the proof tree moves in the same direction as the mouse).

   <b>Sequent</b> <b>Display</b>
       The  sequent display below the proof tree normally shows the ancestor sequent of the current goal. With a
       single left mouse click one can display any goal or proof command in the sequent display. A single  click
       outside  the proof tree will switch back to default behavior. The initial size of the sequent display can
       be set in the <b>Prooftree</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Dialog</b>.  A value of 0 hides the sequent display.

   <b>Tool</b> <b>Tips</b>
       Abbreviated proof commands and sequents are shown in full as tool tips when the mouse pointer rests  over
       them.  Both,  the tool tips for abbreviated proof commands and for sequents can be independently switched
       off in the <b>Prooftree</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Dialog</b>.  The length at which proof commands  are  abbreviated  can  be
       configured as well.

   <b>Additional</b> <b>Displays</b>
       A  double  click  or  a  shift-click  displays  any  goal or proof command in an additional window. These
       additional windows are automatically updated, for instance, if an existential variable  is  instantiated.
       For additional sequent displays one can browse the instantiation history of the sequent using the forward
       and backward buttons. These additional windows can be <u>detached</u> from the proof tree. A detached display is
       neither automatically updated nor automatically deleted.

   <b>Existential</b> <b>Variables</b>
       <b>Prooftree</b>  keeps  track  of  existential  variables, whether they have been instantiated and whether they
       depend on some other, not (yet) instantiated existential. It uses different colors  for  proved  branches
       that  contain  non-instantiated  existential  variables  and  branches  that  only  depend  on  some  not
       instantiated existential.  The list of currently not (yet) instantiated existential variables is appended
       to proof commands and sequents in tool-tips and the other displays.

       The <b>Existential</b> <b>Variable</b> <b>Dialog</b> displays a table with all existential variables of the current proof  and
       their dependencies. Each line of the table contains a button that marks the proof command that introduced
       this  variable  (with yellow background, by default) and, if present, the proof command that instantiated
       this variable (with orange background, by default).

   <b>Main</b> <b>Menu</b>
       The <u>Menu</u> button displays the main menu. The <u>Clone</u> item clones the current proof  tree  in  an  additional
       window.  This  additional window continues to display a snapshot of the cloned proof tree, no matter what
       happens with the original proof.

       The <u>Show</u> <u>current</u> and <u>Show</u> <u>selected</u> items move the viewport of the proof tree such that the current  proof
       goal, or, respectively, the selected node will be visible (if they exist).

       The <u>Exit</u> item terminates <b>Prooftree</b> and closes all proof-tree displays.

       The  remaining  three  items  display, respectively, the <b>Prooftree</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Dialog</b>, and the <b>Help</b> and
       <b>About</b> windows.

   <b>Context</b> <b>Menu</b>
       A right click displays the <u>Context</u> <u>Menu</u>, which contains additional items.

       The item <u>Undo</u> <u>to</u> <u>point</u> is active over sequent nodes in the proof tree. There, it sends an retract or undo
       request to Proof General that retracts the scripting buffer up to that sequent.

       The items <u>Insert</u> <u>command</u> and <u>Insert</u> <u>subproof</u> are active over proof commands. They sent, respectively, the
       selected proof command or all proof commands in the selected subtree, to  Proof  General,  which  inserts
       them at point.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Prooftree</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Dialog</b>
       The  <u>Save</u> button stores the current configuration (as marshaled <b>OCaml</b> record) in <u><a href="file:~/.prooftree">~/.prooftree</a></u>, which will
       overwrite the built-in default configuration for the following <b>Prooftree</b> runs. The  <u>Revert</u>  button  loads
       and applies the saved configuration.  The <u>Cancel</u> and <u>OK</u> buttons close the dialog, but <u>Cancel</u> additionally
       resets  the  configuration  to  the  state  before the start of the dialog. To avoid opening partial file
       names, the <u>Log</u> <u>Proof</u> <u>General</u> <u>input</u> check box is deactivated when typing the log file name.

   <b>Proof</b> <b>General</b> <b>Customization</b>
       The location of the <b>Prooftree</b> executable and the command line arguments are in  the  customization  group
       <u>proof-tree</u>.  Prover specific points, such as the regular expressions for navigation and cheating commands
       are in the customization group <u>proof-tree-internals</u>.  To visit a customization group, type <u>M-x</u> <u>customize-</u>
       <u>group</u> followed by the name of the customization group inside <b>Proof</b> <b>General</b>.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       For  <b>Coq</b>  &gt;= 8.5, existential variables in <b>Prooftree</b> are severely broken because <b>Coq</b> does not provide the
       necessary information, see <b>Coq</b> bug 4504.

       In <b>Coq</b>, proofs must be started with command <u>Proof</u>, which is the  recommended  practice  anyway  (see  Coq
       problem report 2776).

       In  additional sequent displays, the information about existential variables is only shown for the latest
       version of the sequent and not for older versions in the instantiation history. The current communication
       protocol between <b>Proof</b> <b>General</b> and <b>Prooftree</b> does not permit more.

</pre><h4><b>PREREQUISITES</b></h4><pre>
       This version of <b>Prooftree</b> requires <b>Coq</b> 8.4beta or better and <b>Proof</b> <b>General</b> 4.3pre130327 or better.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:~/.prooftree">~/.prooftree</a>
              Saved <b>Prooftree</b> configuration. Is loaded at application  start-up  for  overwriting  the  built-in
              default configuration. Must contain a marshaled <b>OCaml</b> configuration record.
