       Publish a CSV file to a Google Spreadsheet sheet.

       This is a convenient script to update an existing Google Spreadsheet document with the contents of a  CSV
       file.

       NOTE: This script replaces and obsoletes 'upload-csv-to-google-sheet'.

       For  example,  this invocation creates a new Google Sheet doc and upload the contents of the CSV files to
       sheets named 'apples' and 'oranges':

              upload-to-sheets apples.csv oranges.csv

       You can override the name of the sheets created by appending a colon and the name, like this:

              upload-to-sheets apples.csv:Apples oranges.csv:Oranges

       If you'd like to upload the sheets in an existing document, provide it as an option:

              upload-to-sheets <b>--docid=</b>"1xcCjHM...j1ubo0Y09DfGn8HRMLY" apples.csv oranges.csv

       Note that if you do this and there are existing sheets with the same names, e.g.  "apples", the  contents
       of  these  sheets  will be replaced by the uploaded contents. All the other sheets will remain untouched.
       This is designed so that you can manually craft a custom spreadsheet and upload only some  of  it  sheets
       with contents derived from another program (e.g. Beancount).

       This script only requires the latest and official Google client API libraries (it does not need gdata nor
       Python  wrappers for sheets). It uses the v4 Sheets API (current as of 2013-2017-12-15). You will need to
       have an installation of the following libraries for this to work:

              * google-api-python-client (Google Python client API) * oauth2client * httplib2

       Moreover, you will need to enable the Google Sheets API in the developer console and download the  Client
       Secrets that Google provides to <a href="file:~/.google-apis.json.">~/.google-apis.json.</a> (You can override this location with the GOOGLE_APIS
       environment variable.)

   <b>positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>
       filenames
              CSV filenames[:name] to upload. If 'name' is not provided, infer from the filename.

   <b>options:</b>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              show this help message and exit

       <b>--auth_host_name</b> AUTH_HOST_NAME
              Hostname when running a local web server.

       <b>--noauth_local_webserver</b>
              Do not run a local web server.

       <b>--auth_host_port</b> [AUTH_HOST_PORT ...]
              Port web server should listen on.

       <b>--logging_level</b> {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}
              Set the logging level of detail.

       <b>--docid</b> DOCID, <b>--doc</b> DOCID, <b>--id</b> DOCID, <b>-d</b> DOCID
              Spreadsheets doc id to update

       <b>--title</b> DOCTITLE, <b>-t</b> DOCTITLE
              Set or update the spreadsheet's title

       <b>--verbose</b>, <b>-v</b>
              Print out the log

       <b>--min-rows</b> MIN_ROWS
              Minimum  number rows to resize uploaded sheet to. This is useful when another sheet feeds from the
              uploaded one, which otherwise automatically renumbers its references to rows  beyond  it  if  they
              existed, to avoid most such resizing woes.
