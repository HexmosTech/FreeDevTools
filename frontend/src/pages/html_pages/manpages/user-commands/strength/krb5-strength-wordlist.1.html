       krb5-strength-wordlist - Create a krb5-strength database from a word list

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>krb5-strength-wordlist</b> [<b>-am</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>output-cdb</u>] [<b>-l</b> <u>min-length</u>]
           [<b>-L</b> <u>max-length</u>] [<b>-o</b> <u>output-wordlist</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>output-sqlite</u>]
           [<b>-x</b> <u>exclude</u> ...] <u>wordlist</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>krb5-strength-wordlist</b> converts a word list (a file containing one word per line) into a database that
       can be used by the krb5-strength plugin or <b>heimdal-strength</b> command for checking passwords.  Two database
       formats are supported, with different features.  CDB is more space-efficient and possibly faster, but
       supports checking passwords only against exact matches or simple transformations (removing small numbers
       of leading and trailing characters).  SQLite creates a much larger database, but supports rejecting any
       password within edit distance one of a word in the word list.

       CDB is a format invented by Dan Bernstein for fast, constant databases.  The database is fixed during
       creation and cannot be changed without rebuilding it, and is optimized for very fast access.  For cdb,
       the database generated by this program will have keys for each word in the word list and the constant 1
       as the value.

       SQLite stores the word list in a single table containing both each word and each word reversed.  This
       allows the krb5-strength plugin or <b>heimdal-strength</b> command to reject passwords within edit distance one
       of any word in the word list.  (Edit distance one means that the word list entry can be formed by
       changing a single character of the password, either by adding one character, removing one character, or
       changing one character to a different character.)  However, the SQLite database will be much larger and
       lookups may be somewhat slower.

       <b>krb5-strength-wordlist</b> takes one argument, the input word list file.  Use the <b>-c</b> option to specify an
       output CDB file, <b>-s</b> to specify an output SQLite file, or <b>-o</b> to just filter the word list against the
       criteria given on the command line and generate a new word list.  The input word list file does not have
       to be sorted.  See the individual option descriptions for more information.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>, <b>--ascii</b>
           Filter all words that contain non-ASCII characters or control characters from the resulting cdb file,
           leaving only words that consist solely of ASCII non-control characters.

       <b>-c</b> <u>output-cdb</u>, <b>--cdb</b>=<u>output-cdb</u>
           Create  a  CDB database in <u>output-cdb</u>.  A temporary file named after <u>output-cdb</u> with ".data" appended
           will be created in the same directory and used to stage the database contents.  The actual  CDB  file
           will  be  built  using  the  <b>cdb</b>  command,  which must be on the user's path.  If either file already
           exists, <b>krb5-strength-wordlist</b> will abort with an error.

           This option cannot be used with <b>-o</b> or <b>-s</b>.

       <b>-L</b> <u>maximum</u>, <b>--max-length</b>=<u>maximum</u>
           Filter all words of length greater than <u>maximum</u> from the resulting cdb database.  The length of  each
           line  (minus  the separating newline) in the input word list will be checked against <u>minimum</u> and will
           be filtered out of the  resulting  database  if  it  is  shorter.   Useful  for  generating  password
           dictionaries  from  word  lists  that  contain  random  noise  that's highly unlikely to be used as a
           password.

           The default is to not filter out any words for maximum length.

       <b>-l</b> <u>minimum</u>, <b>--min-length</b>=<u>minimum</u>
           Filter all words of length less than <u>minimum</u> from the resulting cdb database.   The  length  of  each
           line  (minus  the separating newline) in the input word list will be checked against <u>minimum</u> and will
           be filtered out of the  resulting  database  if  it  is  shorter.   Useful  for  generating  password
           dictionaries  where  shorter  passwords  will be rejected by a generic length check and no dictionary
           lookup will be done for a transform of the password shorter than the specified minimum.

           The default is not to filter out any words for minimum length.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--man</b>, <b>--manual</b>
           Print out this documentation (which is done simply by feeding the script to "perldoc -t").

       <b>-o</b> <u>wordlist</u>, <b>--output</b>=<u>wordlist</u>
           Rather than creating a database, apply the filter rules given by the other command-line arguments and
           generate a new word list in the file name given by the <u>wordlist</u> option.  This can be used  to  reduce
           the size of a raw word list file (such as one taken from Internet sources) by removing the words that
           will  be  filtered  out  of  the  dictionary anyway, thus reducing the size of the source required to
           regenerate the dictionary.

           This option cannot be used with <b>-c</b> or <b>-s</b>.

       <b>-s</b> <u>output-sqlite</u>, <b>--sqlite</b>=<u>output-sqlite</u>
           Create a SQLite database in <u>output-sqlite</u>.  If this file already exists, <b>krb5-strength-wordlist</b>  will
           abort  with  an  error.   The  resulting  SQLite  database will have one table, "passwords", with two
           columns, "password" and "drowssap".  The first holds a word from the word list, and the second  holds
           the same word reversed.

           Using this option requires the DBI and DBD::SQLite Perl modules be installed.

           This option cannot be used with <b>-c</b> or <b>-o</b>.

       <b>-x</b> <u>exclude</u>, <b>--exclude</b>=<u>exclude</u>
           Filter  all  words  matching  the  regular  expression <u>exclude</u> from the resulting cdb database.  This
           regular expression will be matched against each line of the  source  word  list  after  the  trailing
           newline is removed.  This option may be given repeatedly to add multiple exclusion regexes.
