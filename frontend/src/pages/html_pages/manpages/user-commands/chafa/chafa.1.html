</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       chafa - Character art facsimile generator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>chafa</b> [OPTION...] [IMAGE...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>chafa</b> is a command-line utility that converts image data, including animated GIFs, into graphics formats
       or ANSI/Unicode character art suitable for display in a terminal. It has broad feature support, allowing
       it to be used on devices ranging from historical teleprinters to modern terminal emulators and everything
       in between.

       You can specify one or more input files, but the default behavior is slightly different with multiple
       files -- for instance, animations will not loop forever when there is more than one input file.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
           Show a brief help text.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show version, feature and copyright information.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>ENCODING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f,</b> <b>--format</b> <u>format</u>
           Set output format; one of [iterm, kitty, sixels, symbols]. The default is iterm, kitty or sixels if
           the connected terminal supports one of these, falling back to symbols ("ANSI art") otherwise.

       <b>-O</b> <u>num</u><b>,</b> <b>--optimize</b> <u>num</u>
           Compress the output by using control sequences intelligently [0-9]. 0 disables, 9 enables every
           available optimization. Defaults to 5, except for when used with "-c none", where it defaults to 0.

       <b>--relative</b> <u>bool</u>
           Use relative cursor positioning [on, off]. When on, control sequences will be used to position images
           relative to the cursor. When off, newlines will be used to separate rows instead for e.g. 'less -R'
           interop. Defaults to off.

       <b>--passthrough</b> <u>mode</u>
           Graphics protocol passthrough [auto, none, screen, tmux]. Used to show pixel graphics from within
           multiplexers. Defaults to auto, which will enable passthrough if the Kitty terminal is detected along
           with one of the supported multiplexers. Other combinations must be enabled manually; use with the -f
           option to select the appropriate graphics protocol.

       <b>--polite</b> <u>bool</u>
           Polite mode [on, off]. Inhibits escape sequences that on rare occasions may confuse the terminal or
           other programs. Defaults to off.

</pre><h4><b>SIZE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LAYOUT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--align</b> <u>ALIGN</u>
           Align images in viewport. The following alignments are understood: left, right, top, bottom, hcenter,
           vcenter, center. Two orthogonal alignments can be separated by a comma, e.g. "center,right". The
           meaning of "center" depends on context, and defaults to "hcenter" if ambiguous. "center,center" will
           center along both axes.

           Centering vertically makes sense when used together with "--clear", or possibly as part of a scheme
           where the cursor is pre-positioned at the top-left corner of the view, or a subview when used with
           "--relative on".

       <b>-C</b> <u>bool</u><b>,</b> <b>--center</b> <u>bool</u>
           Center images horizontally in the view [on, off]. Defaults to off. This option is deprecated; use
           "--align center" instead.

       <b>--clear</b>
           Clear screen before processing each file.

       <b>--exact-size</b> <u>mode</u>
           Try to match the input's size exactly [auto, on, off]. When on, this will override other sizing
           options and produce output images at the exact pixel size of the inputs. In auto mode, scaling will
           be avoided (in exchange for padding) if the output size is equal to or slightly bigger than the
           input. When off, padding will never be added, and the image is scaled to fit the containing cell
           extent. Defaults to auto.

       <b>--fit-width</b>
           Fit images to the view's width, potentially exceeding its height.

       <b>--font-ratio</b> <u>width</u><b>/</b><u>height</u>
           Target font's width/height ratio. Can be specified as a real number or a fraction. Defaults to 1/2.
           This will only be applied in symbol mode.

       <b>--margin-bottom</b> <u>num</u>
           When terminal size is detected, reserve at least this many rows at the bottom as a safety margin. Can
           be used to prevent images from scrolling out. Defaults to 1.

       <b>--margin-right</b> <u>num</u>
           When terminal size is detected, reserve at least this many columns on the right-hand side as a safety
           margin. Defaults to 0.

       <b>--scale</b> <u>num</u>
           Scale image, respecting terminal's maximum dimensions. 1.0 approximates original pixel dimensions.
           Specify "max" to use all available space. Defaults to 1.0 for pixel graphics and 4.0 for symbols.

       <b>-s</b> <u>width</u><b>x</b><u>height</u><b>,</b> <b>--size</b> <u>width</u><b>x</b><u>height</u>
           Set maximum output image dimensions in columns and rows. By default this will be equal to the view
           size (see --view-size).

       <b>--stretch</b>
           Stretch image to fit output dimensions; ignore aspect. Implies --scale max.

       <b>--view-size</b> <u>width</u><b>x</b><u>height</u>
           Set the view size in columns and rows. By default this will be the size of your terminal, or 80x25 if
           size detection fails. If one dimension is omitted (by providing a size of e.g. 80x or x25), it will
           be set to a reasonable approximation of infinity.

</pre><h4><b>ANIMATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TIMING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--animate</b> <u>bool</u>
           Whether to allow animation [on, off]. Defaults to on. When off, will show a still frame from each
           animation.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--duration</b> <u>seconds</u>
           Time to show each file, in seconds. Defaults to zero for still images and for animations when
           multiple files are specified. If a single animation is specified, defaults to infinite, or "inf".
           Animations will always be played through at least once, even if duration is e.g. zero. See the
           "Duration" section for more.

       <b>--speed</b> <u>speed</u>
           Set the speed animations will play at. This can be either a unitless multiplier (fractions are
           allowed), or a real number followed by "fps" to apply a specific framerate.

       <b>--watch</b>
           Watch a single input file, redisplaying it whenever its contents change. Will run until manually
           interrupted or, if --duration is set, until it expires.

</pre><h4><b>COLORS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PROCESSING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--bg</b> <u>color</u>
           Background color of display (color name or hex). Partially transparent input will be blended with
           this color. Color names are based on those provided with X.Org. Defaults to black.

       <b>-c</b> <u>mode</u><b>,</b> <b>--colors</b> <u>mode</u>
           Set output color mode; one of [none, 2, 8, 16/8 16, 240, 256, full]. The 240-color mode is
           recommended over the 256-color one, since the lower 16 colors are unreliable and tend to differ
           between terminals. 16-color mode will use aixterm extensions to produce 16 foreground and background
           colors. The 16/8 mode allows for 8 colors plus another "bright" 8 colors in the foreground
           implemented with the "bold" escape sequence. 2-color mode will only emit the ANSI codes for reverse
           color and attribute reset, while "none" will emit no escape sequences at all.

           In sixel mode, "full" will dynamically generate a 256-color palette for each image or animation
           frame. The other modes refer to built-in palettes. "none" and "2" are interchangeable and will use
           the specified foreground/background colors (see --fg and --bg).

           If left unspecified, an optimal default will be chosen based on the current environment.

       <b>--color-extractor</b> <u>extractor</u>
           Method for extracting color from an area; one of [average, median]. Median normally produces crisper
           output, while average may perform better on noisy images. Defaults to average.

       <b>--color-space</b> <u>cs</u>
           Color space used for quantization; one of [rgb, din99d]. Defaults to rgb, which is faster but less
           accurate.

       <b>--dither</b> <u>type</u>
           Type of dithering to apply during quantization. One of [none, ordered, diffusion]. "Bayer" is a
           synonym for "ordered", and "fs" (Floyd-Steinberg) is a synonym for "diffusion".

       <b>--dither-grain</b> <u>width</u><b>x</b><u>height</u>
           Dimensions of grain used when dithering. Specified as width x height, where each can be one of [1, 2,
           4, 8] pixels. One character cell is by definition 8 pixels across in both dimensions. Defaults to 4x4
           in symbol mode and 1x1 in sixel mode.

       <b>--dither-intensity</b> <u>intensity</u>
           Intensity of dithering pattern. Ranges from 0.0 to infinity, with 1.0 considered neutral. Lower
           values tend to reduce the amount of dithering done, while higher values increase it. In practice,
           values higher than 10.0 are unlikely to produce useful results.

       <b>--fg</b> <u>color</u>
           Foreground color of display (color name or hex). Together with the background color specified by
           --bg, this specifies the terminal's palette in color modes 2 and none. Color names are based on those
           provided with X.Org. Defaults to white.

       <b>--invert</b>
           Invert video. For display with bright backgrounds in color modes 2 and none. Swaps --fg and --bg.

       <b>-p</b> <u>bool</u><b>,</b> <b>--preprocess</b> <u>bool</u>
           Image preprocessing [on, off]. Defaults to on with 16 colors or lower, off otherwise. This enhances
           colors and contrast prior to conversion, which can be useful in low-color modes.

       <b>-t</b> <u>threshold</u><b>,</b> <b>--threshold</b> <u>threshold</u>
           Threshold above which full transparency will be used [0.0 - 1.0]. Setting this to 0.0 will render a
           blank image, while a value of 1.0 will replace any transparency with the background color
           (configurable with --bg).

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCE</b> <b>ALLOCATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--threads</b> <u>num</u>
           Maximum number of CPU threads to use. If left unspecified or negative, this will equal available CPU
           cores.

       <b>-w</b> <u>num</u><b>,</b> <b>--work</b> <u>num</u>
           How hard to work in terms of CPU and memory [1-9]. 1 is the cheapest, 9 is the most accurate.
           Defaults to 5.

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>SYMBOL</b> <b>ENCODING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--fg-only</b>
           Leave the background color untouched. This produces character-cell output using foreground colors
           only, and will avoid resetting or inverting the colors.

       <b>--fill</b> <u>symbols</u>
           Specify character symbols to use for fill/gradients. Defaults to none. Usage is similar to that of
           --symbols; see below.

       <b>--glyph-file</b> <u>file</u>
           Load glyph information from file, which can be any font file supported by FreeType (TTF, PCF, etc).
           The glyph outlines will replace any existing outlines, including builtins. Useful in symbol mode for
           custom font support or for improving quality with a specific font. Note that this only makes sense if
           the output terminal is using a matching font. Can be specified multiple times.

       <b>--symbols</b> <u>symbols</u>
           Specify character symbols to employ in final output. See below for full usage and a list of symbol
           classes.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>chafa</b> will return 0 on success, 1 on partial failure or 2 on complete failure (including when invoked
       with no arguments).
       <u>Status</u>   <u>Meaning</u>
       0        Success
       1        Some files failed to display
       2        All files failed to display

</pre><h4><b>SYMBOLS</b></h4><pre>
       Accepted classes for --symbols and --fill are [all, none, space, solid, stipple, block, border, diagonal,
       dot, quad, half, hhalf, vhalf, inverted, braille, technical, geometric, ascii, legacy, sextant, wedge,
       wide, narrow]. Some symbols belong to multiple classes, e.g. diagonals are also borders.

       You can add specific characters with the letter "u" followed by a hexadecimal code point, e.g. "ue080",
       or a range of code points by separating the first and last index by "..", e.g. "u100..u200".

       Symbol sets can also be specified as a string of UTF-8 characters in square brackets, e.g. [abcd]. To
       include a closing bracket in the set, escape it with a backslash.

       You can specify a list of classes separated by commas, or prefix them with + and - to add or remove
       symbols relative to the existing set. The ordering is significant.

       The default symbol set is block+border+space-wide-inverted for all modes except "none", which uses
       block+border+space-wide (including inverse symbols).

</pre><h4><b>DURATION</b></h4><pre>
       In order to accommodate both interactive use and batch processing, an animation's duration is determined
       according to a few simple rules:

        1. If one or more <b>--duration</b> arguments are present, the final instance is respected and applied to every
           file.

        2. Otherwise, if there's a controlling terminal attached (indicating there's an interactive session),
           and only a single file argument is provided, and that file is an animation, it will have infinite
           duration.

        3. Otherwise (no controlling terminal, multiple files, file is a still image), duration will be zero,
           causing animations to play once and then stop.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>chafa</b> <b>in.gif</b>
           Show a potentially animated GIF image in the terminal. If this is an animation, it will run until the
           user generates an interrupt (typically ctrl-c). All parameters will be autodetected based on the
           current environment.

       <b>chafa</b> <b>-c</b> <b>full</b> <b>-s</b> <b>200</b> <b>in.gif</b>
           Like the above, but force truecolor output that is 200 characters wide and calculate the height
           preserving the aspect of the original image.

       <b>chafa</b> <b>-c</b> <b>16</b> <b>--color-space</b> <b>din99d</b> <b>--symbols</b> <b>-dot</b> <b>in.jpg</b>
           Generate 16-color output with perceptual color picking and avoid using dot symbols.

       <b>chafa</b> <b>-c</b> <b>none</b> <b>--symbols</b> <b>block+border-solid</b> <b>in.png</b>
           Generate uncolored output using block and border symbols, but avoid the solid block symbol.
