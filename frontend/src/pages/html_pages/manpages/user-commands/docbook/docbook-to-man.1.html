</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       docbook-to-man — convert <b>DocBook</b>       SGML into roff -man macros

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>docbook-to-man</b> [<u>source.sgml</u>]  [&gt;]  [<u>destination.1</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  docbook-to-man  tool  is a batch converter that transforms UNIX-style manpages from the <b>DocBook</b> SGML
       DTD into nroff/troff -man macros.

       docbook-to-man is the shell command that runs the low-level components to translate a single <b>DocBook</b> SGML
       document instance (whose document element is &lt;RefEntry&gt;)  into  pretty-much  vanilla  -man  macros,  with
       tables rendered in tbl.

       This  is  not  the  original version by Fred Dalrymple, but one with the ANS Modifications by David Bolen
       (<a href="mailto:db3l@ans.net">db3l@ans.net</a>).

       This manual page and some small changes are  by  W.  Borgert  <a href="mailto:debacle@debian.org">debacle@debian.org</a>  for  <b>Debian</b>  <b>GNU/Linux</b>.

</pre><h4><b>White</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>special</b> <b>characters</b></h4><pre>
       If you want to use tabs in your manpage you should use &lt;programlisting&gt;, &lt;literal&gt; or &lt;screen&gt; and invoke
       docbook-to-man  with  INSTANT_OPT  set  to a tab character. Be aware that multiple tabs will be collapsed
       into one.

       When you want to collapse white space into one, you should invoke docbook-to-man with INSTANT_OPT set  to
       a space character.

       Special  characters  like  \,  '  or  .  will not be interpreted if you set INSTANT_OPT to a space or tab
       character.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       If the variable INSTANT_OPT is not set, the <b><a href="../man1/instant.1.html">instant</a>(1)</b> is called with the parameter <b>-d</b> by docbook-to-man.
       If you don't want this, e.g. if you want to use some special characters literally in your SGML file,  you
       can set INSTANT_OPT to just a space character:

       <b>INSTANT_OPT="</b> <b>"</b> <b>docbook-to-man</b> <b>src.sgml</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>dst.1</b>

       Note: The better way to use special characters like ^ or &gt; is to write them in the SGML way, i.e. &amp;caret;
       or &amp;gt;.
