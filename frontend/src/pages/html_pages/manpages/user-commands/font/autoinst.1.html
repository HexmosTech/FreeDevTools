       autoinst - wrapper around the LCDF TypeTools, for installing and using OpenType fonts in LaTeX.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>autoinst</b> <u>-help</u>

       <b>autoinst</b> [<u>options</u>] <b>font(s)</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Eddie Kohler's <u>LCDF</u> <u>TypeTools</u> are superb tools for installing OpenType fonts in LaTeX, but they can be
       hard to use: they need many, often long, command lines and don't generate the <u>fd</u> and <u>sty</u> files LaTeX
       needs.  <b>autoinst</b> simplifies the use of the <u>TypeTools</u> for font installation by generating and executing
       all commands for <u>otftotfm</u>, and by creating and installing all necessary <u>fd</u> and <u>sty</u> files.

       Given a family of font files (in <u>otf</u> or <u>ttf</u> format), <b>autoinst</b> will create several LaTeX font families:

         -  Four  text  families  (with  lining  and  oldstyle  digits,  each  in  both tabular and proportional
            variants), all with the following shapes:

              <u>n</u>       Roman (i.e., upright) text

              <u>it</u>, <u>sl</u>  Italic and slanted (sometimes called oblique) text

              <u>sc</u>      Small caps

              <u>scit</u>, <u>scsl</u>
                      Italic and slanted small caps

              <u>sw</u>      Swash

              <u>nw</u>      "Upright swash"

         -  For each T1-encoded text family: a family of TS1-encoded symbol fonts, in roman, italic and  slanted
            shapes.

         -  Families  with  superiors,  inferiors,  numerators  and  denominators,  in roman, italic and slanted
            shapes.

         -  Families with "Titling" characters; these <u>"...</u> <u>replace</u> <u>the</u> <u>default</u> <u>glyphs</u> <u>with</u>  <u>corresponding</u>  <u>forms</u>
            <u>designed</u> <u>specifically</u> <u>for</u> <u>titling.</u>  <u>These</u> <u>may</u> <u>be</u> <u>all-capital</u> <u>and/or</u> <u>larger</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>body,</u> <u>and</u> <u>adjusted</u>
            <u>for</u> <u>viewing</u> <u>at</u> <u>larger</u> <u>sizes"</u> (according to the OpenType Specification).

         -  An ornament family; also in roman, italic and slanted shapes.

       Of  course,  if  your  fonts  don't  contain italics, oldstyle digits, small caps etc., the corresponding
       shapes and families are not created.  In addition, the creation  of  most  families  and  shapes  can  be
       controlled by the user (see "COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS" below).

       These families use the <u>FontPro</u> project's naming scheme: <u>&lt;FontFamily&gt;-&lt;Suffix&gt;</u>, where <u>&lt;Suffix&gt;</u> is:

       <u>LF</u>      proportional (i.e., figures have varying widths) lining figures

       <u>TLF</u>     tabular (i.e., all figures have the same width) lining figures

       <u>OsF</u>     proportional oldstyle figures

       <u>TOsF</u>    tabular oldstyle figures

       <u>Sup</u>     superior  characters  (note  that  most fonts have only an incomplete set of superior characters:
               digits, some  punctuation  and  the  letters  <u>abdeilmnorst</u>;  normal  forms  are  used  for  other
               characters)

       <u>Inf</u>     inferior characters; usually only digits and some punctuation, normal forms for other characters

       <u>Titl</u>    Titling characters; see above

       <u>Orn</u>     ornaments

       <u>Numr</u>, <u>Dnom</u>
               numerators and denominators

       The  individual  fonts  are  named <u>&lt;FontName&gt;-&lt;suffix&gt;-&lt;shape&gt;-&lt;enc&gt;</u>, where <u>&lt;suffix&gt;</u> is the same as above
       (but in lowercase), <u>&lt;shape&gt;</u> is either empty, "sc"  or  "swash",  and  <u>&lt;enc&gt;</u>  is  the  encoding  (also  in
       lowercase).  A typical name in this scheme would be <u>FiraSans-Light-osf-sc-ly1</u>.

   <b>Using</b> <b>the</b> <b>fonts</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>LaTeX</b> <b>documents</b>
       <b>autoinst</b>  generates  a  style  file  for using the fonts in LaTeX documents, named <u>&lt;FontFamily&gt;.sty</u>. This
       style file also loads the <u>fontenc</u> and <u>textcomp</u> packages, if necessary.  To use the fonts, add the command
       "\usepackage{<u>&lt;FontFamily&gt;</u>}" to the preamble of your document.

       This style file has a few options:

       "mainfont"
           Redefine "\familydefault" to make this font the main font for the document.  This is a no-op  if  the
           font  is  installed  as  a serif font; but if the font is installed as a sanserif or typewriter font,
           this option saves you from having to redefine "\familydefault" yourself.

       "lining", "oldstyle", "tabular", "proportional"
           Choose which figure style to use.  The defaults are "oldstyle" and "proportional" (if available).

       "scale=<u>&lt;factor&gt;</u>", "scale=MatchLowercase"
           Scale the font by <u>&lt;factor&gt;</u>; as an example, "\usepackage[scale=1.05]{<u>&lt;FontFamily&gt;</u>}" will increase  the
           font's  size  by  5%.   The  special value "MatchLowercase" may be used to scale the font so that its
           x-height matches that of the current main font (which is usually Computer Modern  Roman,  unless  you
           have loaded another font package before this one).  The word "scale" may also be spelled as "scaled".

       "medium", "book", "text", "normal", "regular"
           Select the weight that LaTeX will use as the "regular" weight.

       "heavy", "black", "extrabold", "demibold", "semibold", "bold"
           Select the weight that LaTeX will use as the "bold" weight.

       The  last  two  groups of options will only work if you have the <u>mweights</u> package installed.  The default
       here is not to change LaTeX's default, i.e. use the "m" and "b" weights.

       The style file will also try to load the <u>fontaxes</u> package (on CTAN), which gives easy access  to  various
       font  shapes  and  styles.   Using  the  machinery set up by <u>fontaxes</u>, the generated style file defines a
       number of commands (which take the text to be typeset as argument) and  declarations  (which  don't  take
       arguments,  but  affect  all  text  up  to  the end of the current group) to access titling, superior and
       inferior characters:

           DECLARATION     COMMAND         SHORT FORM OF COMMAND

           \tlshape        \texttitling    \texttl
           \supfigures     \textsuperior   \textsup, \textsu
           \inffigures     \textinferior   \textinf, \textin

       In addition, the existing "\swshape" and "\textsw" commands are redefined to  place  swash  on  <u>fontaxes</u>'
       secondary  shape  axis  (<u>fontaxes</u>  places it on the primary shape axis) to make them behave properly when
       nested, so that "\swshape\upshape" will give upright swash.

       Finally, the style file redefines Latex's "\textsuperscript" and "\textsubscript"  commands  to  use  the
       fonts'  superior  and inferior figures, and modifies Latex's footnote mechanism to use "\textsuperscript"
       instead of reduced-size numerals from the regular text font.  The old  versions  of  these  commands  are
       still available as "\textsuperscript*" and "\textsubscript*".

       There  are  no  commands  for  accessing the numerator and denominator fonts; these can be selected using
       <u>fontaxes</u>' standard commands, e.g., "\fontfigurestyle{numerator}\selectfont".

       Once again: all these commands are only generated for existing shapes and number styles; no commands  are
       generated for shapes and styles that are missing from your fonts.  Note that all these commands are built
       on  top  of  <u>fontaxes</u>; if that package cannot be found, you're limited to using lower-level commands from
       standard NFSS ("\fontfamily", "\fontseries", "\fontshape" etc.).

       By default, <b>autoinst</b> generates text fonts with OT1, LY1 and T1 encodings, and the generated  style  files
       use  T1  as  the  default  text  encoding.  Other encodings can be chosen using the <u>-encoding</u> option (see
       "COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS" below).

   <b>Maths</b>
       This is an experimental feature; <b>USE</b> <b>AT</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>OWN</b> <b>RISK!</b>  Test the results thoroughly before using them  in
       real documents, and be warned that future versions of <b>autoinst</b> may introduce incompatible changes.

       The  <u>-math</u>  option  tells  <b>autoinst</b> to generate basic math fonts.  When enabled, the generated style file
       defines a few extra options to access these math fonts:

       "math"
           Use these fonts for the maths in your document.

       "mathlining", "matholdstyle", "mathtabular", "mathproportional"
           Choose which figure style and  alignment  to  use  in  maths.   The  defaults  are  "mathlining"  and
           "mathtabular".

       "mathcal"
           Use  the  swash characters from these fonts as the "\mathcal" alphabet.  (This option will only exist
           if your fonts actually contain both swash characters and a "swsh" feature to access them).

       "nomathgreek"
           Don't redeclare greek letters in math.

       "math-style=<u>&lt;style&gt;</u>"
           Choose the "math style" to use.  With "math-style=ISO", all latin  and  greek  letters  in  math  are
           italic;  with  "math-style=TeX"  (the default), uppercase greek is upright; with "math-style=french",
           all greek as well as uppercase latin is  upright;  and  with  "math-style=upright"  all  letters  are
           upright.

       The  style file also defines commands "\up..." and "\it..." to access upright and italic greek characters
       regardless of the chosen math style: "\upGamma", "\upalpha", "\itDelta", "\itbeta" etc.

       Note that this "math" option only affects digits, latin and greek letters, plus a few  basic  punctuation
       characters;  all other mathematical symbols, operators, delimiters etc. are left as they were before.  If
       you don't want to use TeX's default versions of  those  symbols,  load  another  math  package  (such  as
       <u>mathdesign</u> or <u>newtxmath</u>) before loading the <b>autoinst</b>-generated style file.

       Finally, note that <b>autoinst</b> doesn't check if your fonts actually contains all of the required characters;
       it  just  assumes  that  they  do  and sets up the style file accordingly.  Even if your fonts do contain
       greek, characters such as "\varepsilon" may be missing.  You may also find that some glyphs  <u>are</u>  present
       in  your  fonts,  but don't work well in equations or don't match other symbols; edit the generated style
       file to remove the declarations of these offending characters.  Once again: test the results before using
       them!  If the characters themselves are fine but spaced too tightly, you  may  try  increasing  the  side
       bearings in math fonts with the <u>-mathspacing</u> option (see below), e.g. "-mathspacing=50".

   <b>NFSS</b> <b>codes</b>
       LaTeX's  New  Font  Selection  System  (NFSS)  identifies  fonts  by a combination of family, series (the
       concatenation of weight and width), shape and size.  <b>autoinst</b> parses the  font's  metadata  to  determine
       these  parameters.  When this fails (usually because the font family contains uncommon weights, widths or
       shapes), <b>autoinst</b> ends up with multiple fonts having the same values  for  these  font  parameters;  such
       fonts  cannot  be  used  in  NFSS,  since  there's no way distinguish them.  When <b>autoinst</b> detects such a
       situation, it will print an error message and abort.  If that happens, either rerun <b>autoinst</b> on a smaller
       set of fonts, or add the missing widths, weights and shapes to the tables @WIDTH, @WEIGHT and  %SHAPE  in
       the source code.  Please also send a bug report (see AUTHOR below).

       The mapping of shapes to NFSS codes is done using the following table:

           SHAPE                               CODE
           --------------------------------    ----
           Roman, Upright                      n
           Italic                              it
           Oblique, Slant(ed), Incline(d)      sl

       (<u>Exception:</u>  Adobe  Silentium  Pro  contains  two Roman shapes; we map the first of these to "n", for the
       second one we (ab)use the "it" code as this family doesn't contain an Italic shape.)

       For weights and widths, <b>autoinst</b> tries to the standard NFSS codes (ul, el, l, sl, m, sb, b, eb and ub for
       weights; uc, ec, c, sc, m, sx, x, ex and ux for widths) as much as  possible.   Of  course,  not  all  81
       combinations  of  these  NFSS weights and widths will map to existing fonts; and conversely it may not be
       possible to assign every existing font a unique code in a sane way (especially for the weights, some font
       families offer more variants than NFSS's codes can handle; e.g., Fira  Sans  contains  fifteen  different
       weights!).  Therefore every font is also assigned a "series" name that is the concatenation of its weight
       and  width,  after  expanding  any abbreviations and converting to lowercase.  A font of "Cond" width and
       "Ultra" weight will then be known as "ultrablackcondensed".

       The exact mapping between fonts and NFSS codes can be found in the generated <u>fd</u> files and in the log file
       (you may want to run <b>autoinst</b> with the <u>-dryrun</u> option to  check  the  chosen  mapping  beforehand).   The
       <u>-nfssweight</u>  and  <u>-nfsswidth</u>  command-line options can be used to finetune the mapping between NFSS codes
       and fonts.

       To access specific weights or widths, one can always use the "\fontseries" command with the  full  series
       name (i.e., "\fontseries{demibold}\selectfont").

   <b>Ornaments</b>
       Ornament  fonts are regular LY1-encoded fonts, with a number of "regular" characters replaced by ornament
       glyphs.  The OpenType specification says that fonts should only put  their  ornaments  in  place  of  the
       lowercase  ASCII  letters,  but  some  fonts put them in other positions (such as those of the digits) as
       well.

       Ornaments  can  be  accessed  like  "{\ornaments  a}"   and   "{\ornaments\char"61}",   or   equivalently
       "\textornaments{a}" and "\textornaments{\char"61}".  To see which ornaments a font contains (and at which
       positions),  run  LaTeX  on the file <u>nfssfont.tex</u> (which is included in any standard LaTeX installation),
       supply the name  of  the  ornament  font  (i.e.,  "GaramondLibre-Regular-orn-u")  and  give  the  command
       "\table\bye"; this will create a table of all glyphs in that font.

       Note  that  versions  of <b>autoinst</b> up to 20200428 handled ornaments differently, and fonts and style files
       generated by those versions are not compatible with files generated by newer versions.

</pre><h4><b>WARNINGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>OpenType</b> <b>fonts</b> <b>and</b> <b>licensing</b> <b>issues</b>
       Since <u>pdfTeX</u> cannot subset otf-flavoured OpenType fonts, <u>otftotfm</u> will convert such fonts to Type1  (pfb)
       format.   However,  many  fonts  (at  least  those licensed under the SIL Open Font License) do not allow
       redistributing such converted versions under their original name.

       In order to try to meet such licensing requirements, <b>autoinst</b> provides a  <u>-t1suffix</u>  command-line  option
       that  appends a suffix to the names (both the filename and the internal font name) of all generated Type1
       fonts; see "COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS" below.

       Please note that I am not a lawyer and do not guarantee that  this  suffix  is  sufficient  to  meet  the
       license's requirements.  When in doubt, consult a real lawyer!

   <b>Sorry,</b> <b>LIGTABLE</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b>
       The LIGTABLE in TeX's <u>tfm</u> files, which contains a font's ligatures and kerning pairs, is limited to about
       32,500  entries (2^15 - 256).  If the number of ligatures plus kerns in a font is higher than that limit,
       <u>pltotf</u> and <u>vptovf</u> will complain loudly and ignore the excess entries.  This happens at least with Adobe's
       Source Serif 4 and Minion 3 font families.  Even when <u>pltotf</u> and <u>vptovf</u> don't warn about  the  LIGTABLE's
       size,  you  may  still  find  that  <u>pdftex</u> crashes with a "Bad metric (TFM) file" error.  The best way to
       handle this situation is to use <b>autoinst</b>'s "-extra" option to raise <u>otftotfm</u>'s value for the "--min-kern"
       parameter, which causes it to ignore small kerning pairs: "-extra='--min-kern=6.0'".  Finding the correct
       value for the "--min-kern" parameter may require some trial and error.

   <b>A</b> <b>note</b> <b>for</b> <b>MiKTeX</b> <b>users</b>
       Automatically installing the fonts into a suitable TEXMF tree (as <b>autoinst</b> tries to do by  default)  only
       works  for  TeX-installations  that use the <u>kpathsea</u> library; with TeX distributions that implement their
       own directory searching, such as MiKTeX, <b>autoinst</b> will complain that it cannot find the <u>kpsewhich</u> program
       and move all generated files into a subdirectory "autoinst_output/" of the current directory.  If you use
       such a TeX distribution, you should either move these files to their correct destinations by hand, or use
       the <u>-target</u> option (see "COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS" below) to manually specify a TEXMF tree.

       Also, some OpenType fonts contain so many kerning pairs that the resulting <u>pl</u> and <u>vpl</u> files are  too  big
       for  MiKTeX's  <u>pltotf</u>  and <u>vptovf</u>; the versions that come with W32TeX (<u><a href="http://www.w32tex.org">http://www.w32tex.org</a></u>) and TeXLive
       (<u><a href="http://tug.org/texlive">http://tug.org/texlive</a></u>) don't seem to have this problem.

   <b>A</b> <b>note</b> <b>for</b> <b>MacTeX</b> <b>users</b>
       By default, <b>autoinst</b> will try to install all  generated  files  into  the  $TEXMFLOCAL  tree;  when  this
       directory  isn't user-writable, it will use the $TEXMFHOME tree instead.  Unfortunately, MacTeX's version
       of "updmap-sys" doesn't search in $TEXMFHOME, and hence MacTeX will not find the new fonts.

       To remedy this, either run <b>autoinst</b> as root (so that it  can  install  everything  into  $TEXMFLOCAL)  or
       manually run "updmap -user" to tell TeX about the files in $TEXMFHOME.  This latter option does, however,
       come with some caveats; see <u>https://tug.org/texlive/scripts-sys-user.html</u>.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>autoinst</b>  tries  hard to do The Right Thing (TM) by default, so you usually won't need these options; but
       most aspects of its operation can be fine-tuned if you want to.

       You may use either one or two dashes before options, and option names may be shortened to a unique prefix
       (e.g., <b>-encoding</b> may be abbreviated to <b>-enc</b> or even  <b>-en</b>,  but  <b>-e</b>  is  ambiguous  (it  may  mean  either
       <b>-encoding</b> or <b>-extra</b>)).

   <b>General</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-help</b>
           Print a (relatively) short help text and exit.

       <b>-dryrun</b>
           Don't generate output; just parse input fonts and write the results to the log file.

       <b>-verbose</b>
           Add more details to the log file.

       <b>-version</b>
           Print <b>autoinst</b>'s version number and exit.

   <b>Font</b> <b>creation</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-encoding</b>=<u>encoding[,encoding]</u>
           Generate  the  specified  encoding(s)  for  the text fonts.  Multiple encodings may be specified as a
           comma-separated list (without spaces!); the default choice of encodings is "OT1,LY1,T1".

           For each encoding argument, <b>autoinst</b> will first check if it is the filename of an encoding file,  and
           if  found  it  will use that; otherwise the argument is assumed to be the name of one of the built-in
           encodings.  Currently <b>autoinst</b> comes with built-in support for the OT1, T1/TS1, LY1, T2A/B/C, T3/TS3,
           T4, T5, LGR, CS, L7X and QX encodings.  (These files are called <u>fontools_ot1.enc</u> etc. to  avoid  name
           clashes with other packages; the <u>fontools</u><b>_</b> prefix may be omitted.)

       <b>-ts1</b>/<b>-nots1</b>
           Control  the  creation of TS1-encoded fonts. The default is <b>-ts1</b> if the text encodings (see <u>-encoding</u>
           above) include T1, <b>-nots1</b> otherwise.

       <b>-lining</b>/<b>-nolining</b>
           Control the creation of fonts with lining figures. The default is <b>-lining</b>.

       <b>-oldstyle</b>/<b>-nooldstyle</b>
           Control the creation of fonts with oldstyle figures. The default is <b>-oldstyle</b>.

       <b>-proportional</b>/<b>-noproportional</b>
           Control the creation of fonts with proportional figures. The default is <b>-proportional</b>.

       <b>-tabular</b>/<b>-notabular</b>
           Control the creation of fonts with tabular figures. The default is <b>-tabular</b>.

       <b>-smallcaps</b>/<b>-nosmallcaps</b>
           Control the creation of small caps fonts. The default is <b>-smallcaps</b>.

       <b>-swash</b>/<b>-noswash</b>
           Control the creation of swash fonts. The default is <b>-swash</b>.

       <b>-titling</b>/<b>-notitling</b>
           Control the creation of titling families. The default is <b>-titling</b>.

       <b>-superiors</b>/<b>-nosuperiors</b>
           Control the creation of fonts with superior characters.  The default is <b>-superiors</b>.

       <b>-inferiors</b> [ = <b>none</b> | <b>auto</b> | <b>subs</b> | <b>sinf</b> | <b>dnom</b> ]
       <b>-noinferiors</b>
           The OpenType standard defines several kinds of digits that might be used as inferiors or  subscripts:
           "Subscripts" (OpenType feature "subs"), "Scientific Inferiors" ("sinf"), and "Denominators" ("dnom").
           This  option  allows the user to determine which of these styles <b>autoinst</b> should use for the inferior
           characters.  Alternatively, the value "auto" tells <b>autoinst</b> to use the first value in "sinf",  "subs"
           or  "dnom"  that  is supported by the font.  Saying just <b>-inferiors</b> is equivalent to <b>-inferiors=auto</b>;
           otherwise the default is <b>-noinferiors</b>.

           <u>If</u> <u>you</u> <u>specify</u> <u>a</u> <u>style</u> <u>of</u> <u>inferiors</u> <u>that</u> <u>isn't</u> <u>present</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>font,</u> <u><b>autoinst</b></u> <u>will</u> <u>fall</u>  <u>back</u>  <u>to</u>  <u>its</u>
           <u>default</u>  <u>behaviour</u> <u>of</u> <u>not</u> <u>creating</u> <u>fonts</u> <u>with</u> <u>inferiors</u> <u>at</u> <u>all;</u> <u>it</u> <u>won't</u> <u>try</u> <u>to</u> <u>substitute</u> <u>one</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
           <u>other</u> <u>styles.</u>

       <b>-fractions</b>/<b>-nofractions</b>
           Control the creation of fonts with numerators and denominators.  The default is <b>-nofractions</b>.

       <b>-ligatures</b>/<b>-noligatures</b>
           Some fonts contain glyphs for the standard f-ligatures (ff, fi, fl, ffi, ffl), but  don't  provide  a
           "liga"  feature  to  access  these.   This  option tells <b>autoinst</b> to add extra "LIGKERN" rules to the
           generated fonts to enable the use  of  these  ligatures.   The  default  is  <b>-ligatures</b>,  except  for
           typewriter fonts.

           Specify  <b>-noligatures</b>  to  disable  generation  of  ligatures even for fonts that do contain a "liga"
           feature.

       <b>-ornaments</b>/<b>-noornaments</b>
           Control the creation of ornament fonts. The default is <b>-ornaments</b>.

       <b>-serif</b>/<b>-sanserif</b>/<b>-typewriter</b>
           Install the font as a serif, sanserif or typewriter font, respectively.  This changes how you  access
           the font in LaTeX: with "\rmfamily"/"\textrm", "\sffamily"/"\textsf" or "\ttfamily"/"\texttt".

           Installing  the font as a typewriter font will cause two further changes: it will - by default - turn
           off the use of f-ligatures (though this can be overridden with the <u>-ligatures</u> option),  and  it  will
           disable  hyphenation for this font.  This latter effect cannot be re-enabled in <b>autoinst</b>; if you want
           typewriter text to be hyphenated, use the <u>hyphenat</u> package.

           If none of these options is specified, <b>autoinst</b> tries to guess: if the font's filename  contains  the
           string  "mono"  or  if  the  field  "isFixedPitch" in the font's "post" table is True, it will select
           <b>-typewriter</b>; else if the filename contains "sans" it will select <b>-sanserif</b>; otherwise it will opt for
           <b>-serif</b>.

       <b>-math</b>
           Tells <b>autoinst</b> to create basic math fonts (see above).

       <b>-mathspacing</b>=<u>amount</u>
           Letterspace each character in the math fonts by <u>amount</u> units, where 1000 units equal one em.   In  my
           opinion, many text fonts benefit from letterspacing by 50 to 100 units when used in maths; some fonts
           need even more. Use your own judgement!

   <b>Output</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-t1suffix</b> [ = <u>SUFFIX</u> ]
           Tell  <b>autoinst</b>  to modify the font names of all generated Type1-fonts, by adding <u>SUFFIX</u> to the family
           name.  If you use this option without specifying a <u>SUFFIX</u> value, <b>autoinst</b> will use  the  value  "PS".
           The default behaviour when this option is not given is to not modify font names at all.

           See also "OpenType fonts and licensing issues" in "WARNINGS AND CAVEATS" above.

       <b>-target</b>=<u>DIRECTORY</u>
           Install all generated files into the TEXMF tree at <u>DIRECTORY</u>.

           By  default,  <b>autoinst</b>  searches the $TEXMFLOCAL and $TEXMFHOME trees and installs all files into the
           first user-writable TEXMF tree it finds.  If <b>autoinst</b> cannot  find  such  a  user-writable  directory
           (which  shouldn't  happen,  since $TEXMFHOME is supposed to be user-writable) it will print a warning
           message and put all files into the subdirectory "autoinst_output/" of the  current  directory.   It's
           then  up  to  the  user  to  move  the  generated  files to a better location and update all relevant
           databases (usually by calling <u>texhash</u> and <u>updmap</u>).

       <b>-vendor</b>=<u>VENDOR</u>
       <b>-typeface</b>=<u>TYPEFACE</u>
           These options are equivalent to  <u>otftotfm</u>'s   <u>--vendor</u>  and   <u>--typeface</u>  options:  they  change  the
           "vendor"  and  "typeface"  parts of the names of the subdirectories in the TEXMF tree where generated
           files will be stored.  The default values are "lcdftools" and  the  font's  FontFamily  name.   These
           options change <u>only</u> directory names, not the names of any generated files.

       <b>-logfile</b>=<u>filename</u>
           Write  log  data  to  <u>filename</u>  instead of the default <u>&lt;fontfamily&gt;.log</u>.  If the file already exists,
           <b>autoinst</b> appends to it; it doesn't overwrite an existing file.

   <b>Specialist</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-defaultlining</b>/<b>-defaultoldstyle</b>
       <b>-defaulttabular</b>/<b>-defaultproportional</b>
           Tell <b>autoinst</b> which figure style is the current font family's default (i.e., which  figures  you  get
           when you don't specify any OpenType features).

           <u>Don't</u>  <u>use</u>  <u>these</u>  <u>options</u> <u>unless</u> <u>you</u> <u>are</u> <u>certain</u> <u>you</u> <u>need</u> <u>them!</u>  They are only needed for fonts that
           don't provide OpenType features for their default figure style; and even  in  that  case,  <b>autoinst</b>'s
           default values (<b>-defaultlining</b> and <b>-defaulttabular</b>) are usually correct.

       <b>-nfssweight</b>=<u>code</u>=<u>weight</u>
       <b>-nfsswidth</b>=<u>code</u>=<u>width</u>
           Map  the  NFSS code <u>code</u> to the given weight or width, overriding the built-in tables.  Each of these
           options may be given multiple times, to override more than one NFSS code.  Example: to map  the  "ul"
           code  to  the  "Thin"  weight,  use  "-nfssweight=ul=thin".   To  inhibit  the  use  of the "ul" code
           completely, use "-nfssweight=ul=".

       <b>-extra</b>=<u>extra</u> <u>options</u>
           Pass <u>extra</u> <u>options</u> to the commands for <u>otftotfm</u>.  To prevent <u>extra</u>  <u>options</u>  from  accidentily  being
           interpreted as options to <b>autoinst</b>, they should be properly quoted.

       <b>-manual</b>
           Manual  mode;  for  users  who  want  to  post-process  the generated files and commands. By default,
           <b>autoinst</b> immediately executes all <u>otftotfm</u> commands it generates; in manual mode, these  are  instead
           written  to  a  file  <u>autoinst.bat</u>.   Furthermore  it  tells <u>otftotfm</u> to generate human readable (and
           editable) <u>pl/vpl</u> files instead of the default <u>tfm/vf</u> ones, and to place  all  generated  files  in  a
           subdirectory  "./autoinst_output/"  of  the current directory, rather than install them into your TeX
           installation.

           When using this option, you need to execute the following manual steps after <b>autoinst</b> has finished:

           - run <u>pltotf</u> and <u>vptovf</u> on the generated <u>pl</u> and <u>vf</u> files, to convert them to <u>tfm/vf</u> format;
           - move all generated files to a proper TEXMF tree, and, if necessary, update the filename database;
           - tell TeX about the new <u>map</u> file (usually by running "updmap" or similar).

           Note that some options (<u>-target</u>, <u>-vendor</u> and <u>-typeface</u>) are meaningless, and hence ignored, in manual
           mode.

           Also note that font name modification doesn't happen in manual mode.

       <b>-nofigurekern</b>
           Some fonts provide kerning pairs for tabular figures.  This is very probably not what you want (e.g.,
           numbers in tables won't line up exactly).  This option adds extra  <u>--ligkern</u> options to the  commands
           for  <u>otftotfm</u> to suppress such kerns.  Note that this option leads to very long commands (it adds one
           hundred  <u>--ligkern</u> options), which may cause problems on some systems; hence  it  is  not  active  by
           default.

</pre><h4><b>RECENT</b> <b>CHANGES</b></h4><pre>
       (See the source for the full story, all the way back to 2005.)

       <u>2025-01-07</u>  The  'fix'  in  font  metadata  parsing  that  we  introduced  for  Source Serif 4 was biting
                   Libertinus Serif Display (and maybe other fonts as well), so we now test  if  the  family  is
                   actually Source Serif 4 before applying that fix.

       <u>2024-01-04</u>  We  take  a more generic approach to font metadata parsing; this should work better for fonts
                   with unusually named weights or widths.  We now also warn in font metadata parsing could  not
                   find a 'Regular' weight or width.

       <u>2023-12-30</u>  Bugfix: font info parsing now works for Junicode 2.

       <u>2023-09-14</u>  Added the "\up..." and "\it..." commands to the style file.

       <u>2023-06-28</u>  Adapted font metadata parsing for Adobe Source Serif 4.

       <u>2023-02-01</u>  Added support for the T4, T5, CS, L7X and QX encodings.

       <u>2023-01-31</u>  If the fonts contain superior and/or inferior figures, the generated style file now redefines
                   the  "\textsuperscript" and "\textsubscript" commands, and patches Latex's footnote mechanism
                   to use these figures (inspired by the <u>realscripts</u> package).  Fixed a  few  bugs  in  metadata
                   parsing,  style file generation and the "-t1suffix" option, so that the latter also works for
                   dvips and dvipdfmx.
