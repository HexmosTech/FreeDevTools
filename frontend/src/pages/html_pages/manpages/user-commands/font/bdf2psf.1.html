       bdf2psf - convert a BDF font to PSF format for the Linux console

       <b>bdf2psf</b> <b>[--fb]</b> <b>[--log</b> <u>logfile</u><b>]</b> <u>bdf</u><b>{+</b><u>bdf</u><b>}</b> <u>equivalence</u><b>{+</b><u>equivalence</u><b>}</b> <u>symbols</u><b>{+[:]</b><u>symbols</u><b>}</b> <u>size</u> <u>psf</u> <b>[</b><u>sfm</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  program <b>bdf2psf</b> translates BDF fonts to PSF format. It accepts fonts with arbitrary size of the font
       matrix. If the width of the glyph matrix of the source font is 7 or 9 pixels then it generates fonts with
       width of 8 pixels.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --fb   Generate font for framebuffer. There are two important differences between the framebuffer and the
              text mode. First, all fonts in text mode have to have matrix 8 pixels width.  They  also  have  to
              have either 256 or 512 glyphs. Second, in most text modes the hardware does some magic in order to
              use  8  pixels  width  fonts  as  if  they were 9 pixels width. In order to achieve this the video
              hardware copies the 8th column in the 9th column of the glyphs with codes from 0xC0  to  0xDF  and
              from  0x1C0 to 0x1DF.  <b>Bdf2psf</b> is very careful when deciding where to place a particular glyph and
              as a result the encoding of the generated font is more or less arbitrary.

       --log logfile
              Record in the file <u>logfile</u> any problems during the conversion.

       bdf{+bdf}
              The "+"-separated list of the source BDF font(s). When a particular symbol is defined in more than
              one of the specified fonts then fonts listed first take precedence.

       equivalence{+equivalence}
              A "+"-separated list of files defining an equivalence relation between the glyphs. See the section
              EQUIVALENCE FILES below.

       symbols{+[:]symbols}
              A "+"-separated list of files describing character sets.  The  generated  font  will  support  all
              specified  character  sets.  When there is no space in the PSF font for all symbols, the character
              sets listed first take precedence.  When a colon before a character set is specified  no  warnings
              will  be  issued  for symbols that could not be placed in the font. See the section CHARACTER SETS
              below.

       size   The size of the PSF font. Usually 256 or 512 glyphs.

       psf    The name of the generated font.  If a file with this name already exists it will be overwritten.

       sfm    Save in the file <b>sfm</b> the SFM of the generated font. This parameter is optional.

</pre><h4><b>CHARACTER</b> <b>SETS</b></h4><pre>
       The encodings of the traditional console fonts a similar to  the  standard  encodings  of  the  different
       languages.  For example there are fonts for all variants of ISO 8859.  This is redundant, for example ISO
       8859-1,  ISO  8859-9  and ISO 8859-15 differ only by few characters and can be easily covered by only one
       font.

       In order to determine the minimal set of character sets a clustering algorithm has been used. The  source
       code  of <b>fontconfig</b> contains lists of the characters that most languages require - one list per language.
       We started with one character set per language and used the clustering algorithm in  order  to  join  the
       character sets to bigger.  The character sets described in files installed in the directory <u>fontsets</u> were
       the  result of the algorithm.  These files list the unicodes of the symbols of the character set, one per
       line. Comments starting with a sharp sign are also allowed.

       The files <u>ascii.set</u>, <u>linux.set</u>, <u>freebsd.set</u> and <u>useful.set</u> contain  four  special  character  sets.   The
       first  lists the ASCII symbols and the second and the third list the symbols from the so called alternate
       character set (see section "Line Graphics" of <b><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></b>(5)) - one for Linux and one for  FreeBSD.   Notice
       that  in  order  to  limit  itself  to  the  cp437  character  set,  the  Linux  console driver does some
       approximations of the symbols from the alternate  character  set.  For  example  it  prints  U+256A  (BOX
       DRAWINGS  VERTICAL  SINGLE AND HORIZONTAL DOUBLE) instead of the not-equal sign. The file linux.set lists
       the symbols used by the Linux console driver (i.e. U+256A instead of the not-equal  sign).   The  symbols
       from freebsd.set are not fixed by the FreeBSD kernel, but there too there are some approximations.

       In  most  cases  there is more available space in the fonts than necessary. The spare codes can be filled
       with the symbols from the <u>useful.set</u> special character set.  It is convenient to use a colon  before  the
       name of <u>useful.set</u> on the command line of <b>bdf2psf</b> so no warnings are issued when there is no space in the
       font for some of these symbols.

</pre><h4><b>EQUIVALENCE</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  equivalence  files  define  an  equivalence  relation  between  unicodes. The sharp sign is used for
       comments, the empty lines are ignored. All other lines should list two or more unicodes.  Only one  glyph
       will be allocated in the PSF font for these unicodes.

       Example:

            U+2126 U+03A9
            # U+2126:   OHM SIGN
            # U+03A9:   GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA
            U+041D U+0048
            # U+041D:   CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER EN
            # U+0048:   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER H

       This  equivalence  file says that U+2126 (the Ohm sign) and U+03A9 (Omega) have the same look so only one
       glyph is enough for them. And also U+041D (Cyrillic En) and U+0048 (Latin H) look the same.

       Two equivalence files are provided - <u>standard.equivalents</u> and <u>arabic.equivalents.</u>  The first one  can  be
       used  for  all  fonts.  The purpose of the second is to reduce the number of the necessary glyphs for the
       Arabic letters at the cost of the font quality.  It should be used only for fonts that  have  to  support
       Arabic  but  there is not enough space in the PSF font for all Arabic characters.  The <b>Uni1</b> character set
       is a character set that requires <u>arabic.equivalents.</u>

       All   mentioned   files   and   directories   are   usually   installed    in    <u>/usr/share/bdf2psf</u>    or
       <u>/usr/local/share/bdf2psf.</u>
