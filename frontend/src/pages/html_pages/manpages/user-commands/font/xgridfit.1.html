</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xgridfit</b> - a program for gridfitting, or "hinting," TrueType fonts

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xgridfit</b> <b>[options]</b> <u>file.</u>{<u>xgf</u> or <u>xml</u>}...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Xgridfit</b>  is  a  simple  program  that  implements  an  XML-based language for gridfitting, or "hinting,"
       TrueType fonts.  It compiles an XML  source  file  into  tables  and  instructions  that  relate  to  the
       gridfitting  of glyphs.  <b>Xgridfit</b> does not insert these elements into a font itself, but rather relies on
       FontForge, the Open Source font editor, to do this.

       For each input file specified on the command line, the <b>xgridfit</b> command generates a script named <u>file.py.</u>
       You may run this script in <u>FontForge</u> thus:

           $ fontforge -script file.py

       Alternatively, you can skip generation of a script file and execute  the  script  (the  FontForge  Python
       bindings are required for this):

           $ xgridfit --execute file.xgf

       For more information about <b>Xgridfit,</b> point your browser to <u>file:///usr/share/doc/xgridfit/html/index.html</u>
       or <u><a href="http://xgridfit.sourceforge.net">http://xgridfit.sourceforge.net</a></u>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Note  that  many  of  these  options  can  also  be  specified by "default" elements in the program file.
       However, command-line options always override these defaults.

       -a value, --max-stack=value
              Size of TrueType stack (default is 256)

       -A, --auto-instr
              Auto-instruct all glyphs in the font before installing Xgridfit programming. This  option  has  no
              effect except in merge-mode (option -m).

       -b value, --delta-break=value
              Delta  Break  value:  formerly the maximum number of delta pairs that could be placed on the stack
              with a single push instruction.  As of version 1.11 it approximates that behavior  by  setting  -p
              option to twice the specified value. This option has no effect in Python mode (option -l py).

       -c yes|no, --compile-globals=yes|no
              Compile functions, control values, pre-program and maxp entries (default is "yes")

       -C gray|grey|black|white, --color=gray|grey|black|white
              Use this color for rounded distances except where specified otherwise (default is "gray").

       --config=file
              Read this configuration file instead of the default.

       -d, --debug-mode
              Run in debug mode. Output is <u>file.debug</u> rather than <u>file.py</u>

       -D, --delete-all
              Delete  all  instruction-related programming and data before installing Xgridfit programming. This
              option has no effect except in merge-mode (option -m). Otherwise,  when  the  output  language  is
              Python, TrueType data is deleted except when --compile-globals=no.

       -e     Display diagnostic messages (mainly for debugging Xgridfit).

       -E, --elapsed-time
              Report the time (in seconds) used to run Xgridfit.

       -f, --execute
              Execute  the  generated script, and do not save it in a file.  This option overrides -O, and it is
              incompatible with -d, -S and -z.

       -F file, --data-file=file
              In merge-mode, Xgridfit stores and reads information about the font's state. By default,  this  is
              stored  in  FontForge's font.persistent object, which can be stored only in an .sfd file. Use this
              option to store font information in a file instead.

       -g glyph+list, --glyph-select=glyph+list
              Compile only the specified glyphs, ignoring all others.  The argument is a list  of  one  or  more
              glyph names, delimited by plus signs ("+"). The list must contain no spaces.

       -G yes|no, --init-graphics=yes|no
              Include  or omit at the beginning of each glyph program a function call that initializes variables
              used to track the graphics state.  The default is "yes." This option can be  overridden  with  the
              init-graphics attribute on any glyph element.

       -h, --help
              Display a help message and exit.

       -H yes|no, --auto-hint=yes|no
              Auto-hint  all  glyphs  in the font before auto-instructing. This option has no effect except when
              auto-instructing is requested (option -A).

       -i file, --infile=file
              File to be input by generated script. Must have extension <u>.sfd</u> or <u>.ttf</u>

       -l py|ff, --language=py|ff
              Whether the output of Xgridfit should be a Python script or one in the native FontForge  scripting
              language.  The default is <u>py.</u>  Alternatively, set the environment variable XGRIDFIT_OUTPUT_LANG to
              "ff" or "py".

       -m, --merge-mode
              Run in merge-mode. Xgridfit produces  a  Python  script  that  merges  Xgridfit  programming  with
              TrueType programming already present in the font.

       -o file, --outfile=file
              File to be output by generated script. Must have extension <u>.sfd</u> or <u>.ttf</u>

       -O file, --output-script=file
              Name  of script file to be output by Xgridfit, rather than the default, which replaces <u>.xgf</u> in the
              input file with <u>.py</u>

       -p value, --push-break=value
              The number of values that can be pushed with a single PUSHB or PUSHW instruction. The  default  is
              255, except when the output language is ff (-l ff); then the default is 20.

       -P yes|no, --combine-prep=yes|no
              Combine the Xgridfit pre-program with the prep table already present in the font (merge-mode only;
              default is yes).

       --processor=libxslt|lxml|xsltproc|saxon-6|saxon-9|xalan-j|xalan-c|4xslt
              Select a preferred XSLT processsor. Xgridfit will use this one if possible.

       -q, --quiet
              Run in quiet mode. Routine messages are suppressed.

       -s value, --max-storage=value
              Maximum places in TrueType storage area. This area is used to store variables, and also Xgridfit's
              own run-time data.  The number must always be 24 or greater

       -S name, --output-base=name
              Save script for each glyph in a separate file named <u>name_glyph-name.py</u> - or <u>.pe</u> or <u>.debug</u>

       --skip-validation
              Do not validate the Xgridfit program before compiling.

       -t value, --max-twilight=value
              Maximum number of points in Twilight zone. The default is 25, but few fonts require so many

       -T file, --temp-file=file
              Name  of  a  temporary  file  in which to store result of XInclude processing: the compiler and/or
              validator is run against this file. If this  option  is  used,  the  file  is  not  deleted  after
              processing;  if  it  is not used, the file (named by Xgridfit) is deleted.  This option is ignored
              when a temporary file is not needed.

       -v, --version
              Print version number and exit

       -V     Validate the Xgridfit program against a schema before compiling. Compilation is performed only  if
              validation  suceeds.  By  default  xmllint is used for validation; run xgfconfig to choose another
              validator.

       --validator=libxml2|lxml|jing|msv|rnv
              Select a preferred Relax NG validator. Xgridfit will use this validator if possible.

       -x, --skip-compilation
              Do not compile. Validation is performed unless suppressed.

       -X, --no-xinclude
              Assume that XInclude processing is unnecessary; do not check.

       -z file, --output-outfile-script=file
              When the -S option is present and the -o option or the &lt;outfile&gt; element has been used to make the
              output script save a font or FontForge source file, the output of the &lt;outfile&gt; script is saved in
              a separate script file. Xgridfit will supply a default name for this file, but  this  option  lets
              you supply your own name.
