       otftotfm - create TeX font metrics from OpenType fonts

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>otftotfm</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>options</b>] <u>fontfile</u> [<u>texname</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Otftotfm</b>  creates  the  font  metric  and  encoding files required to use an OpenType font with TeX.  You
       supply an OpenType ".otf" or ".ttf" font file, a base ".enc" encoding, and a TeX name "<u>texname</u>"  for  the
       resulting  font,  and  say  which  OpenType  features  should  be turned on.  Then <b>otftotfm</b> generates and
       installs the corresponding TeX-related metric files (".tfm" TeX font metrics, ".vf"  virtual  fonts,  and
       ".enc"  encoding  files).   It  works  on  both PostScript-flavored and TrueType-flavored OpenType fonts,
       although TrueType-flavor support will only work easily with pdftex.

       The easiest way to use <b>otftotfm</b> is with the <b>-a</b> option; see Automatic Mode below.   Without  <b>-a</b>,  <b>otftotfm</b>
       writes all its output files to the current directory.

       After  running  "<b>otftotfm</b> <u>fontfile</u> <u>texname</u>" and installing the results (manually or with <b>-a</b>), you can use
       the OpenType font in plain TeX with a command like this:

           \font\myfont=<u>texname</u> at 10pt
           {\myfont This text uses the OpenType font.}

       LaTeX   users   will   generally    make    a    ".fd"    input    file    so    that    commands    like
       "\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{TeXName}"  work  correctly.   See  the  EXAMPLE  section  for  more; check the
       DIAGNOSTICS and FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS sections if you have trouble.

   <b>OpenType</b> <b>Features</b>
       OpenType fonts support optional <u>features</u> that change their appearance.  Use the  <b>-f</b>  option  to  turn  on
       selected  features.   For  example,  "<b>-f</b>smcp"  replaces  lower-case  letters with the corresponding small
       capitals, in fonts that support this.

       You'll generally provide at least the "<b>-f</b>kern" and "<b>-f</b>liga" options, which activate  pair  kerns  and  f-
       ligatures.   Other  interesting  features  include  "<b>-f</b>cpsp", for capital spacing; "<b>-f</b>dlig", for optional
       ligatures; "<b>-f</b>lnum", "<b>-f</b>onum", "<b>-f</b>pnum", and "<b>-f</b>tnum", to  control  digit  glyphs;  "<b>-f</b>smcp",  for  small
       capitals;  "<b>-f</b>swsh",  for  swash variants; and "<b>-f</b>cswh", for contextual swash.  See the FEATURE DIRECTORY
       section below for more.  The <b><a href="../man1/otfinfo.1.html">otfinfo</a></b>(1) program will report which features a font supports; run  "<b>otfinfo</b>
       <b>-f</b> <u>fontfile</u>".

       Feature options can also apply a feature to a subset of characters in the font.  For example, "<b>--lf</b> smcp"
       <u>only</u>  replaces  letters  with  small  capitals,  whereas  "<b>-f</b>smcp"  might additionally replace digits and
       punctuation marks with small-capital versions.

   <b>Automatic</b> <b>Mode</b>
       Automatic mode, triggered by the <b>-a</b>/<b>--automatic</b> option, installs font metrics and  encoding  files  where
       TeX can find them, and additionally installs a Type 1 font and mapping for <b><a href="../man1/dvips.1.html">dvips</a></b>(1).  This requires a TeX
       installation  that  follows  the TeX Directory Structure standard (<a href="http://www.tug.org/tds/">http://www.tug.org/tds/</a>), such as most
       Unix TeX installations.

       Automatic mode should run seamlessly out of the box.  <b>Otftotfm</b> will install metrics files, encodings, map
       files, and Type 1 fonts into <u>$HOME/.texmf-var</u> or any other writable TEXMF directory, and run <b><a href="../man1/updmap.1.html">updmap</a></b>(1) to
       update the global lists of installed fonts.  (On older teTeX installations, you may first  need  to  copy
       the  system's  <u>updmap.cfg</u> file to <u>$HOME/texmf/web2c</u> and run <b><a href="../man1/mktexlsr.1.html">mktexlsr</a></b>(1).  On newer TeXLive installations,
       you may need to set the TEXMFVAR environment variable.)  You can then run "<b>otftotfm</b> <b>-a</b> <u>fontfile</u>  <u>texname</u>"
       and  immediately  refer to the font in TeX using the <u>texname</u> you supplied.  Again, you will have to write
       ".fd" files and/or typescripts to make the font conveniently accessible from LaTeX or ConTeXt.   See  the
       DIAGNOSTICS section if you have problems with these instructions.

       In  automatic  mode,  <b>otftotfm</b>  searches  your  $TEXMFVAR  or  $TEXMF path for a writable directory, then
       installs files under that directory tree as follows:
       <b>File</b> <b>type</b>   <b>Directory</b>                          <b>Filename</b>
       TFM         TEXMF/fonts/tfm/<u>vendor</u>/<u>typeface</u>/   <u>texname</u>[--base].tfm
       VF          TEXMF/fonts/vf/<u>vendor</u>/<u>typeface</u>/    <u>texname</u>.vf
       PL          TEXMF/fonts/pl/<u>vendor</u>/<u>typeface</u>/    <u>texname</u>[--base].pl
       VPL         TEXMF/fonts/vpl/<u>vendor</u>/<u>typeface</u>/   <u>texname</u>.vpl
       encoding    TEXMF/fonts/enc/dvips/<u>vendor</u>/      a_<u>signature</u>.enc
                   or TEXMF/dvips/<u>vendor</u>/
       font map    TEXMF/fonts/map/dvips/<u>vendor</u>/      <u>vendor</u>.map
                   or TEXMF/dvips/<u>vendor</u>/

       "TEXMF" stands for the writable TEXMF directory.  <u>Texname</u> is the font name supplied as <b>otftotfm</b>'s  second
       argument.   The  <u>vendor</u>  and  <u>typeface</u>  strings  are required by TDS; they default to "lcdftools" and the
       font's family name, respectively, but see the <b>--vendor</b> and <b>--typeface</b> options.  <u>Signature</u>  is  an  opaque
       6-character encoding signature.

       <b>Otftotfm</b>  also  installs  a  font  file  suitable  for  printing.  PostScript-flavored OpenType fonts are
       translated to Type 1 format and installed as PFB fonts.  TrueType-flavored fonts are  normally  installed
       as  is,  since  pdftex  and  pdflatex can read TrueType directly; but if you provide the <b>--type42</b> option,
       <b>otftotfm</b> will translate TrueType fonts to Type 42 format, which dvips  understands.   <b>Otftotfm</b>  does  not
       overwrite existing font files.

       The installation paths are as follows, where <u>PSname</u> is the font's PostScript name.
       PFB        TEXMF/fonts/type1/<u>vendor</u>/<u>typeface</u>/      <u>PSname</u>.pfb
       TrueType   TEXMF/fonts/truetype/<u>vendor</u>/<u>typeface</u>/   <u>fontfile</u>
       Type 42    TEXMF/fonts/type42/<u>vendor</u>/<u>typeface</u>/     <u>PSname</u>.t42

       You  can  override  these  directories  with  environment variables and options as follows.  Options take
       precedence over environment variables.
       <b>File</b> <b>type</b>   <b>Environment</b> <b>variable</b>   <b>Option</b>
       TFM         TFMDESTDIR             --tfm-directory
       VF          VFDESTDIR              --vf-directory
       PL          PLDESTDIR              --pl-directory
       VPL         VPLDESTDIR             --vpl-directory
       encoding    ENCODINGDESTDIR        --encoding-directory
       PFB         T1DESTDIR              --type1-directory
       TrueType    TRUETYPEDESTDIR        --truetype-directory
       Type 42     T42DESTDIR             --type42-directory
       font map    -                      --map-file

       <b>Otftotfm</b> will update the <u>TEXMF/ls-R</u> file when installing  files  under  TEXMF.   It  will  also  run  the
       <b><a href="../man1/updmap.1.html">updmap</a></b>(1)  program after changing a map file, unless the <b>--no-updmap</b> option was supplied.  However, if an
       executable file called <u>TEXMF/dvips/updmap</u> exists, this file is executed (from the <u>TEXMF/dvips</u>  directory)
       rather than the global <b>updmap</b>.  This is so you can write a fast, customized version of <b>updmap</b> if desired.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  uses  MinionPro  to  show  one way to install OpenType fonts for LaTeX.  We begin with six
       fonts: "MinionPro-Regular.otf", "MinionPro-It.otf", "MinionPro-Semibold.otf", "MinionPro-SemiboldIt.otf",
       "MinionPro-Bold.otf", and "MinionPro-BoldIt.otf".

       Our first task is to decide how to encode the fonts.  The "encoding scheme" is used by TeX to decide  how
       to  typeset accents and symbols like "$".  The "LY1" encoding scheme has reasonable accent support and is
       a good choice for many OpenType fonts.  LY1 corresponds to the "texnansx.enc" encoding file, so  we  will
       supply <b>otftotfm</b> with the "<b>-e</b> texnansx" option.

              Expert  note:  Strictly  speaking, LY1 corresponds to the "texnansi.enc" encoding file.  Since the
              "texnansx.enc" version omits duplicate characters, it has more room for font-specific  glyphs  and
              is  generally  a  better  choice;  but if you plan to type characters like "ae" directly into your
              editor, rather than using TeX commands like \ae, you should use "texnansi.enc".

       Next, we decide on a naming scheme for the font metric files.  Let's use the OpenType  font  names  as  a
       base.   (There's generally no need to follow the six-character "Karl Berry" naming scheme.)  Just in case
       we come back later and add a different encoding scheme, we'll prepend "LY1--" to each name.

       We're now ready to run <b>otftotfm</b> for the first set of fonts.  Note  the  "<b>-f</b>kern  <b>-f</b>liga"  options,  which
       access pair kerns and the default "f" ligatures.

           <b>otftotfm</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-e</b> texnansx MinionPro-Regular.otf \
                   <b>-f</b>kern <b>-f</b>liga LY1--MinionPro-Regular
           <b>otftotfm</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-e</b> texnansx MinionPro-It.otf \
                   <b>-f</b>kern <b>-f</b>liga LY1--MinionPro-It
           <b>otftotfm</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-e</b> texnansx MinionPro-Semibold.otf \
                   <b>-f</b>kern <b>-f</b>liga LY1--MinionPro-Semibold
           <b>otftotfm</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-e</b> texnansx MinionPro-SemiboldIt.otf \
                   <b>-f</b>kern <b>-f</b>liga LY1--MinionPro-SemiboldIt
           <b>otftotfm</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-e</b> texnansx MinionPro-Bold.otf \
                   <b>-f</b>kern <b>-f</b>liga LY1--MinionPro-Bold
           <b>otftotfm</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-e</b> texnansx MinionPro-BoldIt.otf \
                   <b>-f</b>kern <b>-f</b>liga LY1--MinionPro-BoldIt

       The  small-caps  fonts are generated with an additional "<b>-f</b>smcp" option.  We append "--fsmcp" to the font
       metric names as well, differentiating them from the regular fonts.   Although  MinionPro's  italic  fonts
       support small-caps, the LaTeX font selection scheme can't access them easily, so we've left them off.

           <b>otftotfm</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-e</b> texnansx MinionPro-Regular.otf \
                   <b>-f</b>kern <b>-f</b>liga <b>-f</b>smcp LY1--MinionPro-Regular--fsmcp
           <b>otftotfm</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-e</b> texnansx MinionPro-Semibold.otf \
                   <b>-f</b>kern <b>-f</b>liga <b>-f</b>smcp LY1--MinionPro-Semibold--fsmcp
           <b>otftotfm</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-e</b> texnansx MinionPro-Bold.otf \
                   <b>-f</b>kern <b>-f</b>liga <b>-f</b>smcp LY1--MinionPro-Bold--fsmcp

       To  get  old-style numerals, just add the "<b>-f</b>onum" option to each invocation -- and, to reduce confusion,
       append "--fonum" to the font metric names.

       At this point, all our font metric files are installed, and it's finally time to create the  ".fd"  file.
       (The  ".fd"  format is documented in <u>The</u> <u>LaTeX</u> <u>Companion</u>.)  Let's call the LaTeX font family "MinionPro".
       Then the ".fd" file is "LY1MinionPro.fd", and it contains:

           \DeclareFontFamily{LY1}{MinionPro}{}
           \DeclareFontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{m}{n}%
                   { &lt;-&gt; LY1--MinionPro-Regular }{}
           \DeclareFontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{m}{it}{ &lt;-&gt; LY1--MinionPro-It }{}
           \DeclareFontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{m}{sc}%
                   { &lt;-&gt; LY1--MinionPro-Regular--fsmcp }{}
           \DeclareFontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{sb}{n}%
                   { &lt;-&gt; LY1--MinionPro-Semibold }{}
           \DeclareFontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{sb}{it}%
                   { &lt;-&gt; LY1--MinionPro-SemiboldIt }{}
           \DeclareFontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{sb}{sc}%
                   { &lt;-&gt; LY1--MinionPro-Semibold--fsmcp }{}
           \DeclareFontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{b}{n}{ &lt;-&gt; LY1--MinionPro-Bold }{}
           \DeclareFontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{b}{it}%
                   { &lt;-&gt; LY1--MinionPro-BoldIt }{}
           \DeclareFontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{b}{sc}%
                   { &lt;-&gt; LY1--MinionPro-Bold--fsmcp }{}
           \DeclareFontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{bx}{n}%
                   { &lt;-&gt; ssub * MinionPro/b/n }{}
           \DeclareFontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{bx}{it}%
                   { &lt;-&gt; ssub * MinionPro/b/it }{}
           \DeclareFontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{bx}{sc}%
                   { &lt;-&gt; ssub * MinionPro/b/sc }{}

       We're now ready to use MinionPro in LaTeX, with lines like this in the document preamble:

           \usepackage[LY1]{fontenc}
           \renewcommand{\rmdefault}{MinionPro}
           \renewcommand{\bfdefault}{b}

       Of course, we're free at any time to add more MinionPro variants with <b>otftotfm</b>; they'll become accessible
       to LaTeX as soon as we edit the "MinionPro.fd" file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       With long options, you need type only as many characters as will make the option unique.

   <b>Font</b> <b>Feature</b> <b>and</b> <b>Transformation</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-s</b> <u>script</u>[.<u>lang</u>], <b>--script=</b><u>script</u>[.<u>lang</u>]
            Apply features suitable to the script system <u>script</u> and language system <u>lang</u>.  Scripts and  language
            systems  are  two-to-four-letter  names  assigned  by  Microsoft and Adobe.  Examples include "latn"
            (Latin script), "grek" (Greek script), and "yi.YIC" (Yi script with classic characters).  If <u>lang</u> is
            not specified, <b>otftotfm</b> will use the default language system for that script.   You  can  give  this
            option  multiple  times.   Run  "<b>otfinfo</b>  -s  <u>font</u>"  to see the list of scripts and languages a font
            supports.  Defaults to "latn".

       <b>-f</b> <u>feature</u>, <b>--feature=</b><u>feature</u>
            Activate the feature named <u>feature</u>.  Features are four-letter names assigned by Microsoft and Adobe;
            they are meant to correspond to font behaviors, such as kerning or small-capitals.  Examples include
            "liga"  (default  ligatures),  "dlig"  (discretionary  ligatures),  "kern"  (kerning),  and   "c2sc"
            (replacing  capitals  with  small  capitals).   Give  this  option  multiple times to apply multiple
            features.  Run "<b>otfinfo</b> -f [--script option] <u>font</u>" to see the list of features a font supports for a
            specified script.  Defaults to any features required by the selected scripts.

       <b>--lf</b> <u>feature</u>, <b>--letter-feature=</b><u>feature</u>
            Activate the feature named <u>feature</u>, but only for letters.  For instance, the "-f smcp"  option  will
            apply  the  small-caps  feature  to  all  characters  in the encoding; this may result in changes to
            punctuation and numbers as well as letters.  The  "--lf  smcp"  option  will  apply  the  small-caps
            feature only to letters, meaning characters with the "Letter" Unicode property.

       <b>--subs-filter</b> <u>pattern</u>
       <b>--include-subs</b> <u>pattern</u>
       <b>--exclude-subs</b> <u>pattern</u>
       <b>--clear-subs</b>
            Limit  the  characters that <b>otftotfm</b> will substitute.  Substitution is allowed on an input character
            if it matches at least one of the <b>--include</b> patterns, and none  of  the  <b>--exclude</b>  patterns.   Each
            pattern  applies  to  all  following features, except that the <b>--clear</b> option clears any accumulated
            patterns.  The <b>--subs-filter</b> <u>pattern</u>  option  acts  like  <b>--clear-subs</b>  followed  by  <b>--include-subs</b>
            <u>pattern</u>.  For pattern syntax, see GLYPH PATTERNS, below.

            In  the  command line below, the '&lt;Number&gt;' pattern will force the "onum" feature to substitute only
            numbers (and not, for example, punctuation).  The "salt" feature can still substitute any character.
                <b>otftotfm</b> <b>-f</b>salt <b>--include-subs</b>="&lt;Number&gt;" <b>-f</b>onum ...

       <b>-E</b> <u>fac</u>, <b>--extend=</b><u>fac</u>
            Widen, or extend, the font by a factor of <u>fac</u>.  Like <b><a href="../man1/afm2tfm.1.html">afm2tfm</a></b>(1)'s <b>-e</b> option.

       <b>-S</b> <u>amt</u>, <b>--slant=</b><u>amt</u>
            Oblique, or slant, the font by <u>amt</u>.  Like <b><a href="../man1/afm2tfm.1.html">afm2tfm</a></b>(1)'s <b>-s</b> option.

       <b>-L</b> <u>amt</u>, <b>--letterspacing=</b><u>amt</u>
            Letterspace each character by <u>amt</u> units, where  1000  units  equals  one  em.   The  width  of  each
            character increases by <u>amt</u>, with half the space distributed to each sidebearing.  Boundary-character
            kerns are added to maintain alignment at the ends of lines.

       <b>--math-spacing</b>[=<u>skewchar</u>]
            Ignore the font's claimed character widths, deriving horizontal metrics from bounding boxes instead.
            This results in similar spacing as the Computer Modern Math Italic font, with increased sidebearings
            for letters like f and j.

            If  you  provide  <u>skewchar</u>,  a  number  between  0 and 255 or a single character, then <b>otftotfm</b> adds
            heuristically-derived kerns to the font that may improve accent positions in math mode.  To get  the
            benefits, you must tell TeX about the <u>skewchar</u> with a command like "\skewchar\font=<u>skewchar</u>".

       <b>-k</b> <u>N</u>, <b>--min-kern=</b><u>N</u>
            Only  output  kerning  pairs whose absolute value is <u>N</u> or larger.  Larger minimum kerns make kerning
            less precise, but shrink the output TFM file.  The default minimum kern is 2.0, or 0.002 em.

       <b>--space-factor=</b><u>fac</u>
            Scale the width of the inter-word space by a factor of <u>fac</u>.

       <b>--design-size=</b><u>size</u>
            Set the output font's design size to <u>size</u>, a value  in  TeX  points.   This  value  is  mostly  just
            documentation,  since  LaTeX essentially ignores fonts' design sizes, but plain TeX may occasionally
            use the design size to decide how large a font should be.  (Loading a font in TeX "at" a  particular
            size  effectively  ignores  the design size; loading a font plain or "scaled" by a given factor uses
            the design size.)  The default is taken from the input font's optical size feature, or  10pt  if  it
            has no such feature.

       <b>--fixed-width</b>
            Set  the  font  to  fixed-width  (its space character will have no stretch or shrink).  Normally you
            won't need this option; the font will tell <b>otftotfm</b> whether it is  fixed  width.   The  opposite  of
            <b>--fixed-width</b> is <b>--proportional-width</b>.

       <b>--italic-angle=</b><u>angle</u>
            Set the output font's default italic angle to <u>angle</u>, a number of degrees.  This value is used by TeX
            to  position  accents.   Normally you won't need this option; the font will tell <b>otftotfm</b> its italic
            angle.

       <b>--x-height=</b><u>val</u>
            Set the output font's x-height to <u>val</u>.  This value is used by TeX to position accents. Normally  you
            won't  need this option.  <u>Val</u> may be a number expressed in font units; ‘x’, which uses the height of
            the font's lowercase x; or ‘font’, which uses the font's declared x-height metric.

   <b>Encoding</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-e</b> <u>encoding</u>, <b>--encoding=</b><u>encoding</u>
            Select the output metrics's base <b><a href="../man1/dvips.1.html">dvips</a></b>(1) encoding.  <b>Otftotfm</b> will  search  for  <u>encoding</u>[.enc]  the
            same  way that <b>dvips</b> would, so you may not need to give a full pathname.  Say <b>-e</b> <b>-</b> to start with the
            font's default encoding.  See ENCODINGS, below, for more information.

       <b>--boundary-char=</b><u>char</u>
            Set the font's boundary character to <u>char</u>, which should either be a single non-digit character, or a
            number between -1 and 255. The default is taken from the encoding.

       <b>--altselector-char=</b><u>char</u>
            Set the font's alternate selector character to <u>char</u>, which  should  either  be  a  single  non-digit
            character,  or  a  number between -1 and 255.  Alternate selectors let TeX authors explicitly choose
            between versions of a character.  For instance, the '--altselector-char="*"' option  turns  the  "*"
            character  into  a  special  switch that cycles between alternates.  For instance, the TeX input "A"
            would produce the normal version of  the  "A"  Unicode  character,  "A*"  would  produce  the  first
            alternate, "A**" would produce the second alternate, and so forth.  Furthermore, "s*t" will activate
            any discretionary "s_t" ligature in the font.

            The <b>--altselector-char</b> mechanism uses the features specified by <b>--altselector-feature</b> options.

            The  alternate-selector  character may also be specified in the encoding; see ENCODINGS, below.  See
            Sivan Toledo's article cited in the SEE ALSO section for more information.

       <b>--altselector-feature=</b><u>feature</u>
            Activate the feature named <u>feature</u> for the <b>--altselector-char</b> mechanism.  Give this option  multiple
            times   to   activate  multiple  features.   This  option  activates  features  only  for  use  with
            <b>--altselector-char</b>; use the <b>--feature</b> option to activate features globally.  Defaults  to  the  <u>salt</u>
            and <u>dlig</u> features.

       <b>--alternates-filter=</b><u>pattern</u>
       <b>--include-alternates=</b><u>pattern</u>
       <b>--exclude-alternates=</b><u>pattern</u>
       <b>--clear-alternates</b>
            Limit  the  alternate  characters  that <b>otftotfm</b> will select.  An alternate is used if it matches at
            least one of the <b>--include</b> patterns, and none of the <b>--exclude</b> patterns.  Each  pattern  applies  to
            all  following  features,  except  that  the  <b>--clear</b>  option  clears any accumulated patterns.  The
            <b>--alternates-filter</b> <u>pattern</u> option acts like  <b>--clear-alternates</b>  followed  by  <b>--include-alternates</b>
            <u>pattern</u>.  For pattern syntax, see GLYPH PATTERNS, below.

            OpenType  fonts  can  have  many  alternates  per  character, most of which aren't interesting.  For
            example, the character "a" in  WarnockPro-Regular  has  five  alternates,  "ordfeminine",  "Asmall",
            "asuperior",  "a.end",  and  "orn.013".   The <b>--altselector-char</b> option lets you cycle through these
            alternates, but it's better to leave out the ones you  don't  want,  to  avoid  overfull  encodings.
            Thus,    if    you    were   only   interested   in   ".end"   variants,   you   might   supply   an
            '--include-alternates="*.end"' option.

            In the command line below, the '*.end' pattern will apply to "aalt" alternates, but  not  to  "salt"
            alternates.
                <b>otftotfm</b> <b>-f</b>salt <b>--include-alternates</b>="*.end" <b>-f</b>aalt ...

       <b>--ligkern=</b><u>command</u>
            Add  a  LIGKERN  <u>command</u>  to  the  encoding.   For example, '<b>--ligkern</b> "T {L} h"' suppresses any T_h
            ligature in the font.  You can supply multiple <b>--ligkern</b> options.  See ENCODINGS, below.

       <b>--position=</b><u>command</u>
            Add a POSITION <u>command</u> to the encoding.  For example, '<b>--position</b> "T 10 0 20"'  adds  ten  units  of
            space  to  either  side  of  the  "T"  character.   You can supply multiple <b>--position</b> options.  See
            ENCODINGS, below.

       <b>--unicoding=</b><u>command</u>
            Add a UNICODING <u>command</u> to the encoding.  For example, '<b>--unicoding</b> "pi1 =: uni03D6"' tells <b>otftotfm</b>
            to encode "/pi1" as U+03D6 GREEK PI SYMBOL.  You  can  supply  multiple  <b>--unicoding</b>  options.   See
            ENCODINGS, below.

       <b>--no-encoding-commands</b>
            Ignore any LIGKERN and/or UNICODING commands in the encoding file.

       <b>--no-default-ligkern</b>
            Don't include <b>otftotfm</b>'s default LIGKERN commands.

       <b>--coding-scheme=</b><u>scheme</u>
            Add a CODINGSCHEME to the encoding.  See ENCODINGS, below.

       <b>--warn-missing</b>
            Warn  about encoded characters not supported by the font.  See the WARNMISSING command in ENCODINGS,
            below.

       <b>--literal-encoding=</b><u>encoding</u>
            Select the <b><a href="../man1/dvips.1.html">dvips</a></b>(1) encoding used for the font.  No glyph substitutions will be  permitted,  so  the
            output encoding will equal the input encoding (and <b>otftotfm</b> will not generate an output encoding).

       <b>--base-encodings=</b><u>file</u>
            <b>Experts</b> <b>only.</b>  Allow the output font to refer to existing "base" fonts.  This can greatly reduce the
            number of base fonts generated by <b>otftotfm</b>.  Each line in the <u>file</u> argument contains a TeX font name
            (as for <b>--name</b>) and a corresponding literal encoding file (as for <b>--literal-encoding</b>); for example:
                WarnoProReg--eka eka
                WarnoProReg--exp1 exp1
            The  named  fonts  must have been created by prior runs of <b>otftotfm</b> on the same input OpenType font,
            with the same <b>--extend</b> and <b>--slant</b> options as the current run.  The current output font  will  refer
            to  glyphs  from the named base fonts when possible.  If the base fonts cover all glyphs required by
            the output font, <b>otftotfm</b> won't generate any new base fonts at all.  The  <u>file</u>  can  also  refer  to
            dotless-J fonts using the following syntax:
                WarnoProReg--lcdfj - dotlessj

   <b>Automatic</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-a</b>, <b>--automatic</b>
            Select automatic mode.

       <b>-v</b> <u>vendor</u>, <b>--vendor=</b><u>vendor</u>
            Set the font vendor name, which is used to locate files within the TDS.  Defaults to "lcdftools".

            In  automatic  mode,  TeX  and  friends will generally find required font files independently of the
            vendor you select.

       <b>--typeface=</b><u>typeface</u>
            Set the font typeface name, which is used to locate files within the TDS.  Defaults to  the  current
            font's family name with unsuiable characters removed.

       <b>--no-type1</b>
            Do not use <b><a href="../man1/cfftot1.1.html">cfftot1</a></b>(1) to create Type 1 fonts corresponding to the OpenType input fonts.

       <b>--no-dotlessj</b>
            Do  not  use  <b><a href="../man1/t1dotlessj.1.html">t1dotlessj</a></b>(1)  to  create  a  special  dotless-j font when the input font doesn't have
            dotless-j.

       <b>--no-truetype</b>
            Do not install TrueType-flavored fonts.

       <b>--type42</b>
            Install TrueType-flavored fonts in translated Type 42 format.

       <b>--no-updmap</b>
            Do not run an <b><a href="../man1/updmap.1.html">updmap</a></b>(1) program.  This can be useful if you're installing a bunch of  fonts;  it  is
            much faster to run <b>updmap</b> once, at the end, than to run it once per font.

   <b>Output</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-n</b> <u>texname</u>, <b>--name=</b><u>texname</u>
            Set  the  TeX  name  of  the output font, which is used in font map files and, in automatic mode, to
            generate the output filename.  The default is derived from the OpenType font's name and the features
            you selected.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pl</b>
            Output human-readable PL and VPL metrics, not binary TFM and VF metrics.  Note:  <b>Otftotfm</b>'s  PL  and
            VPL  output  files  are legal, but the <b>fontinst</b> program may not accept them (it has a picky parser).
            Make sure to supply a <b>--coding-scheme</b>; if that doesn't help, run the TFM output through <b><a href="../man1/tftopl.1.html">tftopl</a></b>(1).

       <b>--no-virtual</b>
            Do not generate virtual fonts (VFs and VPLs).  <b>Otftotfm</b> will warn  if  the  selected  font  features
            cannot be implemented without virtual fonts.

       <b>--no-encoding</b>
            Do not generate an encoding file.

       <b>--output-encoding</b>[=<u>file</u>]
            Only  generate  an encoding file; do not generate any other output.  The encoding file is written to
            <u>file</u>, or to standard output if no <u>file</u> argument is supplied.

       <b>--no-map</b>
            Do not generate a font map line for the font.

   <b>File</b> <b>Location</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--tfm-directory=</b><u>dir</u>
       <b>--pl-directory=</b><u>dir</u>

       <b>--truetype-directory=</b><u>dir</u>
       <b>--type42-directory=</b><u>dir</u>
       <b>--directory=</b><u>dir</u>
            Set the directory used for various output types.  Each  directory  may  be  set  by  an  environment
            variable,  and  defaults  to  a  TDS  directory in automatic mode, or to "." otherwise.  Environment
            variable names and default TDS locations are described in the Automatic  Mode  section  above.   The
            <b>--directory</b> option sets the default directory for all output types.

       <b>--map-file=</b><u>filename</u>
            Set  file  in  which  <b>otftotfm</b> will write a font map line for the font.  The default is the standard
            output     in     manual      mode,      and      "TEXMF/fonts/map/dvips/<u>vendor</u>/<u>vendor</u>.map"      (or
            "TEXMF/dvips/<u>vendor</u>/<u>vendor</u>.map" on older installations) in automatic mode.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--glyphlist=</b><u>file</u>
            Use  <u>file</u>  as  a  Adobe  glyph list, which helps translate glyph names to Unicode code points.  Give
            multiple options to include multiple files.  See ENCODINGS, below, for more information.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
            Write progress messages to standard error.

       <b>--no-create</b>
            Do not create or modify any  files.   Instead,  write  messages  about  the  program's  hypothetical
            progress to standard error.

       <b>--force</b>
            Generate all files, even if it looks like versions are already installed.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
            Do not generate any error messages.

       <b>--kpathsea-debug=</b><u>flags</u>
            Set path searching debugging flags.  See the <u>Kpathsea</u> manual for details.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Print usage information and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
            Print the version number and some short non-warranty information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>ENCODINGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Otftotfm</b>  interprets  encoding  files  as Unicode.  For example, say an input encoding has "/dotlessi" at
       position 10.  <b>Otftotfm</b> detects that position 10 should  contain  Unicode  character  U+0131  LATIN  SMALL
       LETTER  DOTLESS  I,  and  uses  the  font's  glyph  for  that  character (possibly modified by any active
       features).  The selected glyph might not be named "dotlessi"; only the Unicode value matters.

       <b>Otftotfm</b> assigns Unicode values to glyph names  using  a  table  published  by  Adobe  (SEE  ALSO  has  a
       reference),  with extensions for TeX.  For more fine-grained control, add UNICODING commands to the input
       encoding file.  These commands have the following format:
           % UNICODING <u>glyph</u> =: <u>choice1</u> [<u>choice2</u> ...] ;
       This tells <b>otftotfm</b> that the glyph named <u>glyph</u> translates into the first Unicode value in the <u>choice</u> list
       that has a character in the font.  <u>Glyph</u> and the <u>choice</u>s are PostScript glyph names; the initial "%" sign
       is required; and each UNICODING line can contain multiple commands, separated by spaced semicolons.   For
       example,
           % UNICODING pi1 =: uni03D6 ;
       encodes the character "/pi1" as U+03D6 GREEK PI SYMBOL, and
           % UNICODING Delta =: uni0394 uni2206 ;
       makes  U+0394  GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA preferred to U+2206 INCREMENT as an encoding for "/Delta".  You
       can also supply glyph names:
           % UNICODING Delta =: Deltagreek Delta ;
       A mapping with no Unicode values removes that glyph from the input encoding.  For instance,  this  erases
       any f-ligature characters from the encoding:
           % UNICODING ff =: ; fi =: ; fl =: ; ffi =: ; ffl =: ;
       The slots are available for <b>otftfm</b>'s own use, for example for other characters required by the font.  (If
       the  f-ligatures themselves are required by the font, for instance by a 'liga' feature, then they will be
       stored into their old slots when possible.)  Map a glyph to 'emptyslot' if you don't want <b>otftotfm</b> to use
       the slot.  For example, this will leave the 'ff' slot unused if the font has no 'ff' glyph:
           % UNICODING ff =: ff emptyslot ;
       (Note that most OpenType fonts provide a visible representation for unused encoding slots, namely  a  box
       with an X inside.)

       LIGKERN  comments  in  the  encoding  can  add  ligatures  and inhibit kerns, as in <b><a href="../man1/afm2tfm.1.html">afm2tfm</a></b>(1).  To add a
       ligature, say:
           % LIGKERN <u>glyph1</u> <u>glyph2</u> =: <u>result</u> ;
       The "=:" operator indicates a normal ligature, where both the input glyphs are removed  and  replaced  by
       <u>result</u>.   To preserve the left-hand glyph, for an effect like "<u>glyph1</u> <u>glyph2</u> =: <u>glyph1</u> <u>result</u>", use "|=:"
       instead; to preserve the right-hand glyph, use "=:|".  To remove all kerns between two characters, say:
           % LIGKERN <u>glyph1</u> {} <u>glyph2</u> ;
       A "*" matches any character, so
           % LIGKERN a {} * ;
       removes all kerns with "a" as the left-hand character, and
           % LIGKERN * {} * ;
       removes all kerns.

       <b>Otftotfm</b> also supports extended syntax for setting kern values and inhibiting ligatures.  To  add  an  <u>n</u>-
       unit kern between two glyphs, say:
           % LIGKERNX <u>glyph1</u> {<u>n</u>} <u>glyph2</u> ;
       where <u>n</u> is an integer.  This:
           % LIGKERNX <u>glyph1</u> {L} <u>glyph2</u> ;
       inhibits any ligature between <u>glyph1</u> and <u>glyph2</u>.  "{LK}" and "{KL}" inhibit both ligatures and kerns.

       You can set the <b>--boundary-char</b> and <b>--altselector-char</b> from an encoding file with commands like this:
           % LIGKERN || = <u>boundarychar</u> ;
           % LIGKERNX ^^ = <u>altselectorchar</u> ;
       As  with  UNICODING,  each  LIGKERN  or  LIGKERNX line can contain multiple commands, separated by spaced
       semicolons.

       <b>Otftotfm</b> has a default set of eight ligatures, namely:
           space l =: lslash ; space L =: Lslash ;
           question quoteleft =: questiondown ; exclam quoteleft =: exclamdown ;
           hyphen hyphen =: endash ; endash hyphen =: emdash ;
           quoteleft quoteleft =: quotedblleft ;
           quoteright quoteright =: quotedblright
       LIGKERN commands in the encoding file and <b>--ligkern</b> options can override these defaults,  or  supply  the
       <b>--no-default-ligkern</b> option to turn them off.

       The POSITION command shifts a glyph within its bounding box.  The syntax is
           % POSITION <u>glyph</u> <u>pdx</u> <u>pdy</u> <u>adx</u> ;
       This will add <u>pdx</u> units of space to <u>glyph</u>'s left edge; raise it up by <u>pdy</u> units; and add <u>adx</u> units to its
       width.  For example, to add 10 units of space to either side of the "T" glyph, supply
           % POSITION T 10 0 20
       To move the "degree" symbol up by 20 units, supply
           % POSITION degree 0 20 0

       The  CODINGSCHEME  command  specifies the coding scheme for fonts using this encoding.  This is a string,
       less than 40 characters long and containing no  parentheses,  that  classifies  the  encoding  for  TeX's
       purposes.  Sample coding schemes include "TEX TEXT", "TEX MATH ITALIC", and "EXTENDED TEX FONT ENCODING -
       LATIN".  For example:
           % CODINGSCHEME EXTENDED TEX FONT ENCODING - LATIN
       Most  tools  ignore the coding scheme; fontinst is an exception.  <b>Otftotfm</b> uses the encoding's PostScript
       name for the default coding scheme.

       Finally, the WARNMISSING command makes any glyphs not supported by the input font appear as black  boxes.
       The <b><a href="../man1/dvips.1.html">dvips</a></b>(1) processor will also print a warning when encountering these glyphs.  For example:
           % WARNMISSING yes

       The  <b>--unicoding</b>,  <b>--ligkern</b>,  <b>--position</b>,  <b>--coding-scheme</b>,  and  <b>--warn-missing</b>  options add UNICODING,
       LIGKERN/LIGKERNX, POSITION, CODINGSCHEME, and WARNMISSING commands  to  an  encoding,  and  can  override
       commands  in  the  encoding  itself.  Some common encoding files have commands that are inappropriate for
       OpenType fonts; for example, "t1.enc" hard-codes f-ligatures, which can  cause  problems  with  small-cap
       fonts.  Supply the <b>--no-encoding-commands</b> option to ignore all commands from the encoding file.  Commands
       from options like <b>--ligkern</b> are processed in any case.

   <b>New</b> <b>Glyphs</b>
       New  glyphs,  such  as  ligatures  and  contextual  substitutions, are added to the encoding in any empty
       spaces, using their original locations when possible.  If the encoding doesn't have enough space for  all
       new glyphs, shorter ligatures composed of unaccented letters get precedence.

   <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Glyphs</b>
       <b>Otftotfm</b>  can  synthesize  some  glyphs  using  virtual  font  manipulations,  if a required glyph is not
       available in the input font. Specifically, it will synthesize:

       cwm                   TeX's compound word mark (a zero-width "strut" rule with height equal to the font's
                             x-height)
       ascendercompwordmark  "cwm" with height equal to the font's ascenders

</pre><h4><b>GLYPH</b> <b>PATTERNS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>--include-subs</b> and <b>--include-alternates</b> options, and their <b>--exclude</b> and <b>--*-filter</b> variants,  accept
       the following types of pattern.

       •  Glyph  names.   Example: "Aacute".  For PostScript-flavored fonts, use <b><a href="../man1/otfinfo.1.html">otfinfo</a></b>(1)'s <b>-g</b> option to see a
          font's glyph names, and "<b>cfftot1</b> <u>font</u>.otf | <b>t1testpage</b>" to generate a  PostScript  file  showing  each
          glyph.

       •  Glyph  name  patterns using the shell-style glob-matching rules: "*" matches any number of characters,
          "?" matches any single character, and "[...]"  matches any character in a set.  Example: "*.end".

       •  Unicode category properties in angle brackets.   Examples:  "&lt;Letter&gt;",  "&lt;UppercaseLetter&gt;",  "&lt;Lu&gt;".
          The  complete  list  of  both  short and long names: Letter/L, UppercaseLetter/Lu, LowercaseLetter/Ll,
          TitlecaseLetter/Lt, ModifierLetter/Lm, OtherLetter/Lo;  Number/N,  DecimalNumber/Nd,  LetterNumber/Nl,
          OtherNumber/No;   Punctuation/P,   ConnectorPunctuation/Pc,   DashPunctuation/Pd,  OpenPunctuation/Ps,
          ClosePunctuation/Pe,  InitialPunctuation/Pi,   FinalPunctuation/Pf,   OtherPunctuation/Po;   Symbol/S,
          MathSymbol/Sm,   CurrencySymbol/Sc,   ModifierSymbol/Sk,   OtherSymbol/So;   Mark/M,   SpacingMark/Mc,
          EnclosingMark/Me,     NonspacingMark/Mn;     Separator/Z,     SpaceSeparator/Zs,     LineSeparator/Zl,
          ParagraphSeparator/Zp;  Other/C,  Surrogate/Cs,  Format/Cf,  Control/Cc, PrivateUse/Co, Unassigned/Cn.
          Category values current as of Unicode 4.0.

       •  Unicode ranges.  Example: "U+007f-U+008C".

       The "!" prefix negates a pattern, and you can separate multiple patterns by spaces.

</pre><h4><b>FEATURE</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b></h4><pre>
       This section lists features common to Western OpenType fonts and describes how <b>otftotfm</b> handles them  for
       common fonts.  Please send the author mail if <b>otftotfm</b> does not handle a feature you need, or you believe
       it handles some feature incorrectly.

       <u>aalt</u>, Access All Alternates
            Lets  the  user  choose between all available alternate forms for a character.  This includes things
            like superscript and subscript variants, different styles (swash, for example), and even  ornaments.
            The  <b>--altselector-feature=</b>aalt  option  can  help  an  <b>--altselector-char</b>  provide useful access to
            alternates, but the <u>aalt</u> feature isn't usually useful on its own.  Try the <u>salt</u>  and  <u>calt</u>  features
            instead.
       <u>c2sc</u>, Small Capitals From Capitals
            Replaces  capital  letters  with  small  capitals:  a sort of converse of the more conventional <u>smcp</u>
            feature, which replaces lower-case letters with small capitals.  Supported.
       <u>calt</u>, Contextual Alternates
            Lets the user choose between context-appropriate swash forms for each character.  For example, given
            the word "DREW" in a cursive typeface, the "R E W" might be translated  to  calmer  forms  than  the
            initial "D".  There may be more than one choice for a given letter, in which case the user should be
            able to select among them.  TeX can't support complex contextual alternates, or alternate selection,
            but <b>otftotfm</b> supports some fonts quite well.  The input encoding should have lots of empty space for
            variants, and it should specify a boundary character.  See also <u>cswh</u>.
       <u>case</u>, Case-Sensitive Forms
            Shifts  punctuation  marks  up to a position that works well with all-capital-letter sequences.  For
            example, the hyphen character, which generally centers vertically on the x-height, is raised  up  to
            center  vertically  on a capital letter.  Also replaces text figures with lining figures, and accent
            marks with forms more appropriate for capitals.  Supported.
       <u>cpsp</u>, Capital Spacing
            Adds a bit of space on either side of each capital letter.  Supported.  (However, the  OpenType  tag
            registry  suggests that <u>cpsp</u> be on by default, but applying to all-caps text only; TeX cannot easily
            implement that contextual intelligence.)
       <u>cswh</u>, Contextual Swash
            Lets the user choose between context-appropriate swash forms for each character.   For  example,  in
            the  words  "Ab  AC", the first "A" might be translated to a swash form, while the second might not.
            There may be more than one choice for a given letter, in which case  the  user  should  be  able  to
            select among them.  <b>Otftotfm</b> supports some fonts quite well.  The input encoding should have lots of
            empty space for swash variants, and it should specify a boundary character.  See also <u>calt</u> and <u>swsh</u>.
       <u>dlig</u>, Discretionary Ligatures
            Activates uncommon ligatures, such as "c_t", "s_p", and "s_t".  Supported.
       <u>dnom</u>, Denominators
            Replaces  digits and some punctuation marks with smaller forms sitting on the baseline, intended for
            fraction denominators.  Supported.
       <u>fina</u>, Terminal Forms
            Substitutes appropriate forms for letters occurring at the ends  of  words.   This  feature  doesn't
            select  swash variants; it's intended for normal use, and the specification recommends that it be on
            by default.  Partially supported: TeX will only treat spaces as the ends of words, where  a  correct
            implementation would probably include punctuation too.  See <u>cswh</u> for selecting swash variants active
            at the ends of words.
       <u>frac</u>, Fractions
            Replaces simple sequences like "1/2" with nice-looking fractions.  Supported, but beware: many fonts
            will translate "11/32" into "1" + "1/3" + "2".
       <u>hist</u>, Historical Forms
            Replaces  characters with historical variants.  Usually, this means at least translating regular "s"
            to long "s".  Supported.
       <u>kern</u>, Kerning
            Adjusts the space between characters (pair kerning).  Generally supported, and you  should  probably
            turn  it on.  As a special case, "<b>-f</b>kern" can also read kerning information from the "kern" table in
            conventional TrueType fonts.
       <u>liga</u>, Standard Ligatures
            Activates common ligatures, such as  "f_f",  "f_i",  "f_f_j",  and  (in  some  Adobe  fonts)  "T_h".
            Generally supported, and you should probably turn it on.
       <u>lnum</u>, Lining Figures
            Uses  lining  figures,  the set of digits that are all about as high as capital letters.  Supported.
            Compare <u>onum</u>; see also <u>pnum</u> and <u>tnum.</u>
       <u>numr</u>, Numerators
            Replaces digits and some  punctuation  marks  with  smaller,  raised  forms  intended  for  fraction
            numerators.  Supported, but not usually useful.
       <u>onum</u>, Oldstyle Figures
            Uses  old-style  figures, also known as text figures.  This is the set of digits that have ascenders
            and descenders like lower-case letters.  Supported.  Compare <u>lnum</u>; see also <u>pnum</u> and <u>tnum</u>.
       <u>ordn</u>, Ordinals
            Designed for Spanish and French.  Replaces ordinal numbers, such as "2.o", with forms where the  "o"
            is raised, and replaces the sequence "No" with an integrated glyph.  Supported.
       <u>ornm</u>, Ornaments
            Replaces  some alphabetic characters in the font with ornaments, and links the bullet character to a
            set of all bullet-like ornaments, from which the user can  choose.   Partially  supported:  TeX  can
            handle alphabetic substitutions, but not bullet choice.
       <u>pnum</u>, Proportional Figures
            Digits will have different widths.  Supported.  Compare <u>tnum</u>; see also <u>lnum</u> and <u>onum.</u>
       <u>salt</u>, Stylistic Alternates
            Lets  the  user  choose  between  stylistic alternate forms for a character.  The <b>--altselector-char</b>
            mechanism provides useful access to this feature.  If you turn on <u>salt</u> globally, <b>otftotfm</b> takes  the
            first  alternate  form  whenever  there's  more  than  one  choice.  See also <u>aalt</u> and <u>ss01</u>; <u>salt</u> is
            generally more useful than <u>aalt</u> for TeX, since it refers exclusively to stylistic alternates.
       <u>sinf</u>, Scientific Inferiors
            Replaces digits and some punctuation marks with smaller,  lowered  forms  intended  for  subscripts.
            Supported.  Compare <u>subs</u>.
       <u>size</u>, Optical Size
            This  feature  stores  information about the range of optical sizes for which the font was intended.
            There is no point in selecting it with <b>otftotfm</b>, since it should not change the font's appearance in
            any way.
       <u>smcp</u>, Small Capitals
            Replaces lower-case letters with small capitals.  Supported.  Compare <u>c2sc</u>.
       <u>ss01</u>-<u>ss20</u>, Stylistic Sets 1-20
            Replaces characters with a uniform set of stylistic alternates.  Differs from features like <u>salt</u>  in
            that  a  Stylistic  Set  is  uniform:  an  <u>ssXX</u> feature should never involve selection from a set of
            possible alternate characters.  Supported.
       <u>subs</u>, Subscript
            Replaces characters with smaller, lowered forms intended for subscripts.  Supported.  Compare  <u>sinf</u>;
            some fonts support <u>sinf</u> but not <u>subs</u>.
       <u>sups</u>, Superscript
            Replaces  digits,  some  punctuation  marks,  and some lower-case letters with smaller, raised forms
            intended for superscripts.  Supported.
       <u>swsh</u>, Swash
            Activates all swash forms for each character. There may be more than one swash form, in  which  case
            <b>otftotfm</b> will pick the first one listed.  Supported, except that swash variants other than the first
            are inaccessible.  Note that some fonts with swash variants support the <u>cswh</u> feature exclusively.
       <u>tnum</u>, Tabular Figures
            All  digits  will  have the same width, so that tables and the like will align visually.  Supported.
            Compare <u>pnum</u>; see also <u>lnum</u> and <u>onum.</u>
       <u>zero</u>, Slashed Zero
            Replaces the zero character with a slashed zero.  Supported.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       no writable directory found in $TEXMF
            <b>Otftotfm</b> could not find a writable directory in your $TEXMFVAR or $TEXMF path.   Did  you  create  a
            <u>$HOME/.texmf-var</u>    or    <u>$HOME/texmf</u>    directory?     If    so,   run   the   command   "kpsewhich
            --expand-path='$TEXMF'" to verify that directory is not being found.  You may need to set your TEXMF
            environment variable, to '{!!'"$HOME"'/texmf,!!$TEXMFMAIN}', for instance (note the different  kinds
            of quotes; on my machine, this expands to '{!!/home/kohler/texmf,!!$TEXMFMAIN}').

       '<u>char</u>' has no encoding, ignoring kern removal
       (or ligature removal, lig/kern removal, or ligature)
            These  messages  indicate  a  slight  problem  with  your encoding file: one of the LIGKERN commands
            referred to a character not present in the encoding.  This might be due  to  a  misspelling  in  the
            LIGKERN  command or the encoding file, or it might be an oversight.  Either fix the encoding file or
            ignore the warning.

       can't map '<u>char</u>' to Unicode
            Another encoding file problem: One of the glyph names in an UNICODING block could not  be  converted
            to  Unicode.   This  is  problematic  since  UNICODING  exists  wholly to translate glyph names into
            Unicode.  Fix the encoding file or ignore the warning.

       not enough room in encoding, ignoring <u>N</u> glyph(s) ...
            There wasn't space in the encoding for all the glyphs referred to by the features you selected.  For
            example, maybe the font had more ligatures than there were empty slots in the  encoding.   Fix  this
            warning  by  selecting  fewer  features,  or by using an encoding with more empty slots, such as the
            7t.enc encoding distributed with <b>otftotfm</b>.

       The '<b>-a</b>' option did not install my font correctly.
            Try again with the '<b>--verbose</b>' option, which causes <b>otftotfm</b> to explain its behavior.  Note that  by
            default,  <b>otftotfm</b>  will  not re-install files already present in your system's TeX search paths (in
            the current directory, for instance).  Use '<b>--force</b>' to override this behavior.

</pre><h4><b>FREQUENTLY</b> <b>ASKED</b> <b>QUESTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       How can I get a small-caps "SS" in place of the German sharp-S?
            Supply the option '<b>--unicoding</b> "germandbls =: SSsmall"'.

       How can I prevent f-ligatures from forming in a small-caps font?
            This should happen automatically, but some overzealous encoding files add f-ligatures even when  the
            font doesn't request them.  Try the "<b>--no-encoding-commands</b>" option if this is a problem for you.

       <b>Otftotfm</b> seems to take a long time.
            Use  the  <b>-V</b>  option  to see what it's doing.  Often the culprit is the <b><a href="../man1/updmap.1.html">updmap</a></b>(1) program; if you're
            planning to run <b>otftotfm</b> multiple times, give it the <b>--no-updmap</b> option and run <b>updmap</b> manually when
            you're done.

       How can I refer to the different forms of phi?
            <b>Otftotfm</b> follows TeX practice and widely-distributed TeX encoding vectors, so  "/phi"  in  an  input
            encoding  vector  should map to a "straight" phi and "/phi1" should map to a "loopy" phi.  Note that
            TeX practice differs from the PostScript standard naming conventions, in which "/phi" is "loopy" and
            "/phi1" is "straight"; this means that <b>otftotfm</b> may map "/phi" in an  input  encoding  vector  to  a
            font's  "/phi1"  glyph,  and vice versa.  Perhaps most unambiguously, you can use "/uni03D5" for the
            "straight" form and "/uni03C6" for the "loopy" form.

       How can I get lining figures (that is, normal line-height digits) with small caps ('<b>-f</b>smcp')?
            Many fonts use old-style figures by default with small caps. Since the  default  is  not  specified,
            it's wise to explicitly supply '<b>-f</b>lnum' or '<b>-f</b>onum'.
