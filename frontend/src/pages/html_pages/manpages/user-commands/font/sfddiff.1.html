       sfddiff - compare two font files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sfddiff</b>   [<b>--help</b>]   [<b>--ignorehints</b>]   [<b>--ignorenames</b>]  [<b>--ignoregpos</b>]  [<b>--ignoregsub</b>]  [<b>--ignorebitmaps</b>]
       [<b>--exact</b>] [<b>--warn</b>] [<b>--merge</b> <u>outfile</u>] [<b>--usage</b>] [<b>--version</b>] <u>fontfile1</u> <u>fontfile2</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The program <b>sfddiff</b> compares two font files, which may be in any format that <b><a href="../man1/fontforge.1.html">fontforge</a></b>(1) can  read.   It
       will notice the following differences:

       1)  Characters are present in one font but not in the other.

       2)  Characters  are present in both fonts but have different sets of outlines or references. The outlines
           may be compared so that only exact matches are  accepted,  or  so  that  a  fuzzier  match  is  used.
           Similarly  references  may  need  to  match  exactly,  or may be matched after an unlink.  This fuzzy
           comparison is useful when comparing truetype and postscript fonts, or  when  comparing  a  font  with
           references to one without.

       3)  The PostScript hints or TrueType instructions are different.

       4)  The font names (the TrueType 'name' tables) differ.

       5)  The kerning (and other 'gpos' information) differs.

       6)  The ligatures (and other 'gsub' information) differ.

       7)  Any bitmap strikes present in one font but not in the other.

       8)  Any  bitmap  characters  present  in  one  strike of one font but not in the equivalent strike of the
           other.

       9)  Any bitmap characters which differ.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b>          Provide a description with a list of the available options.

       <b>--ignorehints</b>   Suppress the reporting of hint/instruction differences.

       <b>--ignoregpos</b>    Suppress the reporting of kerning (and other 'gpos') differences.

       <b>--ignoregsub</b>    Suppress the reporting of ligature (and other 'gsub') differences.

       <b>--ignorenames</b>   Suppress the reporting of name string differences.

       <b>--ignorebitmaps</b> Suppress the reporting of bitmap differences.

       <b>--exact</b>         Require outlines to match exactly.

       <b>--warn</b>          Warn if the outlines/references are slightly different.

       <b>--merge</b> <u>outfile</u> Store a merged version of the two fonts into the specified output file.  The merged  data
                       will be based on <u>sfdfile1</u>, any characters present in <u>sfdfile2</u> but not in <u>sfdfile1</u> will be
                       added,  and  the outlines of <u>sfdfile2</u> will be placed in the background.  Finally, for any
                       characters with different outlines or references the background  of  the  character  will
                       contain  the  outlines from <u>sfdfile2</u> (references will be unlinked into outlines and those
                       outlines also will be added).

       <b>--usage</b>         Display the usage description.

       <b>--version</b>       Display the current version.

       There  are many useful libraries available under copyleft libre licenses, such as the LGPL and GPL, which
       FontForge started to use in 2012.

       Some features added since 2012 are licensed by their individual developers under the GPLv3.
