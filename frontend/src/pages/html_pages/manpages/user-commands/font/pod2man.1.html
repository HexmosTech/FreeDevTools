       pod2man <b>--help</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pod2man</b> is a wrapper script around the Pod::Man module, using it to generate *roff input from POD source.
       The resulting *roff code is suitable for display on a terminal using <b><a href="../man1/nroff.1.html">nroff</a></b>(1), normally via <b><a href="../man1/man.1.html">man</a></b>(1), or
       printing using <b><a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff</a></b>(1).

       By default (on non-EBCDIC systems), <b>pod2man</b> outputs UTF-8 manual pages.  Its output should work with the
       <b>man</b> program on systems that use <b>groff</b> (most Linux distributions) or <b>mandoc</b> (most BSD variants), but may
       result in mangled output on older UNIX systems.  To choose a different, possibly more backward-compatible
       output mangling on such systems, use "--encoding=roff" (the default in earlier Pod::Man versions).  See
       the <b>--encoding</b> option and "ENCODING" in Pod::Man for more details.

       <u>input</u> is the file to read for POD source (the POD can be embedded in code).  If <u>input</u> isn't given, it
       defaults to "STDIN".  <u>output</u>, if given, is the file to which to write the formatted output.  If <u>output</u>
       isn't given, the formatted output is written to "STDOUT".  Several POD files can be processed in the same
       <b>pod2man</b> invocation (saving module load and compile times) by providing multiple pairs of <u>input</u> and <u>output</u>
       files on the command line.

       <b>--section</b>, <b>--release</b>, <b>--center</b>, <b>--date</b>, and <b>--official</b> can be used to set the headers and footers to use.
       If not given, Pod::Man will assume various defaults.  See below for details.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Each option is annotated with the version of podlators in which that option was added with its current
       meaning.

       <b>-c</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--center</b>=<u>string</u>
           [1.00] Sets the centered page header for the ".TH" macro to <u>string</u>.  The default is "User Contributed
           Perl Documentation", but also see <b>--official</b> below.

       <b>-d</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--date</b>=<u>string</u>
           [4.00]  Set  the  left-hand  footer  string  for the ".TH" macro to <u>string</u>.  By default, the first of
           POD_MAN_DATE, SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, the modification date of the input file, or  the  current  date  (if
           input comes from "STDIN") will be used, and the date will be in UTC.  See "CLASS METHODS" in Pod::Man
           for more details.

       <b>-e</b> <u>encoding</u>, <b>--encoding</b>=<u>encoding</u>
           [5.00]  Specifies  the encoding of the output.  <u>encoding</u> must be an encoding recognized by the Encode
           module (see Encode::Supported).  The default on non-EBCDIC systems is UTF-8.

           If the output contains characters that cannot be represented in this encoding, that is an error  that
           will  be  reported  as configured by the <b>--errors</b> option.  If error handling is other than "die", the
           unrepresentable character will be replaced with the Encode substitution character (normally "?").

           If the "encoding" option is set to the special value "groff" (the default on EBCDIC systems),  or  if
           the Encode module is not available and the encoding is set to anything other than "roff" (see below),
           Pod::Man  will  translate  all  non-ASCII  characters  to  "\[uNNNN]" Unicode escapes.  These are not
           traditionally part of the *roff language, but are supported by <b>groff</b>  and  <b>mandoc</b>  and  thus  by  the
           majority of manual page processors in use today.

           If <u>encoding</u> is set to the special value "roff", <b>pod2man</b> will do its historic transformation of (some)
           ISO  8859-1 characters into *roff escapes that may be adequate in troff and may be readable (if ugly)
           in nroff.  This was the default behavior of versions of <b>pod2man</b> before 5.00.  With this encoding, all
           other non-ASCII characters will be replaced with "X".  It may be required  for  very  old  troff  and
           nroff implementations that do not support UTF-8, but its representation of any non-ASCII character is
           very poor and often specific to European languages.  Its use is discouraged.

           WARNING:  The  input  encoding of the POD source is independent from the output encoding, and setting
           this option does not affect the interpretation of the POD input.  Unless your POD source is US-ASCII,
           its encoding should be declared with the "=encoding" command in the source.  If  this  is  not  done,
           Pod::Simple  will  will attempt to guess the encoding and may be successful if it's Latin-1 or UTF-8,
           but it will produce warnings.  See <b><a href="../man1/perlpod.1.html">perlpod</a></b>(1) for more information.

       <b>--errors</b>=<u>style</u>
           [2.5.0] Set the error handling style.  "die" says to throw an exception on any POD formatting  error.
           "stderr"  says  to  report  errors  on  standard error, but not to throw an exception.  "pod" says to
           include a POD ERRORS section in the resulting documentation summarizing the errors.   "none"  ignores
           POD errors entirely, as much as possible.

           The default is "die".

       <b>--fixed</b>=<u>font</u>
           [1.0]  The  fixed-width  font to use for verbatim text and code.  Defaults to "CW".  Some systems may
           want "CR" instead.  Only matters for <b>troff</b> output.

       <b>--fixedbold</b>=<u>font</u>
           [1.0] Bold version of the fixed-width font.  Defaults to "CB".  Only matters for <b>troff</b> output.

       <b>--fixeditalic</b>=<u>font</u>
           [1.0] Italic version of the fixed-width font (something of a misnomer, since most  fixed-width  fonts
           only  have  an  oblique  version,  not an italic version).  Defaults to "CI".  Only matters for <b>troff</b>
           output.

       <b>--fixedbolditalic</b>=<u>font</u>
           [1.0] Bold italic (in theory,  probably  oblique  in  practice)  version  of  the  fixed-width  font.
           Pod::Man  doesn't  assume  you  have this, and defaults to "CB".  Some systems (such as Solaris) have
           this font available as "CX".  Only matters for <b>troff</b> output.

       <b>--guesswork</b>=<u>rule</u>[,<u>rule</u>...]
           [5.00] By default, <b>pod2man</b> applies some default formatting  rules  based  on  guesswork  and  regular
           expressions  that  are  intended  to make writing Perl documentation easier and require less explicit
           markup.  These rules may not always be appropriate, particularly for documentation that  isn't  about
           Perl.  This option allows turning all or some of it off.

           The  special  rule  "all" enables all guesswork.  This is also the default for backward compatibility
           reasons.  The special rule "none" disables all guesswork.  Otherwise, the value of this option should
           be a comma-separated list of one or more of the following keywords:

           functions
               Convert function references like foo() to bold even if they have no markup.   The  function  name
               accepts  valid  Perl  characters for function names (including ":"), and the trailing parentheses
               must be present and empty.

           manref
               Make the first part (before the parentheses) of man page references like <a href="../man1/foo.1.html">foo</a>(1) bold even if they
               have no markup.  The section must be a single number optionally followed by lowercase letters.

           quoting
               If no guesswork is enabled, any text enclosed in C&lt;&gt; is surrounded  by  double  quotes  in  nroff
               (terminal)  output unless the contents are already quoted.  When this guesswork is enabled, quote
               marks will also be suppressed for Perl variables, function names, function  calls,  numbers,  and
               hex constants.

           variables
               Convert  Perl  variable  names  to  a  fixed-width  font  even  if  they  have  no  markup.  This
               transformation will only be apparent in troff output, or some other output format  (unlike  nroff
               terminal output) that supports fixed-width fonts.

           Any  unknown  guesswork  name is silently ignored (for potential future compatibility), so be careful
           about spelling.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           [1.00] Print out usage information.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--lax</b>
           [1.00] No longer used.  <b>pod2man</b> used to check its input for validity  as  a  manual  page,  but  this
           should  now  be  done  by <b><a href="../man1/podchecker.1.html">podchecker</a></b>(1) instead.  Accepted for backward compatibility; this option no
           longer does anything.

       <b>--language</b>=<u>language</u>
           [5.00] Add commands telling <b>groff</b> that the input file is in the given language.  The  value  of  this
           setting  must be a language abbreviation for which <b>groff</b> provides supplemental configuration, such as
           "ja" (for Japanese) or "zh" (for Chinese).

           This adds:

               .mso &lt;language&gt;.tmac
               .hla &lt;language&gt;

           to the start of the file, which configure correct line breaking for the specified language.   Without
           these commands, groff may not know how to add proper line breaks for Chinese and Japanese text if the
           man page is installed into the normal man page directory, such as <u><a href="file:/usr/share/man">/usr/share/man</a></u>.

           On  many  systems,  this  will  be  done  automatically if the man page is installed into a language-
           specific man page directory, such  as  <u><a href="file:/usr/share/man/zh_CN">/usr/share/man/zh_CN</a></u>.   In  that  case,  this  option  is  not
           required.

           Unfortunately, the commands added with this option are specific to <b>groff</b> and will not work with other
           <b>troff</b> and <b>nroff</b> implementations.

       <b>--lquote</b>=<u>quote</u>
       <b>--rquote</b>=<u>quote</u>
           [4.08]  Sets  the  quote  marks  used  to  surround  C&lt;&gt; text.  <b>--lquote</b> sets the left quote mark and
           <b>--rquote</b> sets the right quote mark.  Either may also be set to the special  value  "none",  in  which
           case  no  quote  mark  is  added  on  that  side of C&lt;&gt; text (but the font is still changed for troff
           output).

           Also see the <b>--quotes</b> option, which can be used to set both quotes at once.  If both <b>--quotes</b> and one
           of the other options is set, <b>--lquote</b> or <b>--rquote</b> overrides <b>--quotes</b>.

       <b>-n</b> <u>name</u>, <b>--name</b>=<u>name</u>
           [4.08] Set the name of the manual page for the ".TH" macro to <u>name</u>.  Without this option, the  manual
           name  is  set to the uppercased base name of the file being converted unless the manual section is 3,
           in which case the path is parsed to see if it is  a  Perl  module  path.   If  it  is,  a  path  like
           ".../lib/Pod/Man.pm"  is converted into a name like "Pod::Man".  This option, if given, overrides any
           automatic determination of the name.

           Although one does not have to follow this convention, be aware that the convention  for  UNIX  manual
           pages  is  for  the  title  to  be  in  all-uppercase,  even  if  the  command  isn't.  (Perl modules
           traditionally use mixed case for the manual page title, however.)

           This option is probably not useful when converting multiple POD files at once.

           When converting POD source from standard input, the name will be set to "STDIN" if this option is not
           provided.  Providing this option is strongly recommended to set a meaningful manual page name.

       <b>--nourls</b>
           [2.5.0] Normally, L&lt;&gt; formatting codes with a URL but anchor text are  formatted  to  show  both  the
           anchor text and the URL.  In other words:

               L&lt;foo|<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>&gt;

           is formatted as:

               foo &lt;<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>&gt;

           This flag, if given, suppresses the URL when anchor text is given, so this example would be formatted
           as  just  "foo".  This can produce less cluttered output in cases where the URLs are not particularly
           important.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--official</b>
           [1.00] Set the default header to indicate that this page is part of the  standard  Perl  release,  if
           <b>--center</b> is not also given.

       <b>-q</b> <u>quotes</u>, <b>--quotes</b>=<u>quotes</u>
           [4.00] Sets the quote marks used to surround C&lt;&gt; text to <u>quotes</u>.  If <u>quotes</u> is a single character, it
           is  used as both the left and right quote.  Otherwise, it is split in half, and the first half of the
           string is used as the left quote and the second is used as the right quote.

           <u>quotes</u> may also be set to the special value "none", in which case no quote marks are added around C&lt;&gt;
           text (but the font is still changed for troff output).

           Also see the <b>--lquote</b> and <b>--rquote</b> options, which can be used  to  set  the  left  and  right  quotes
           independently.   If both <b>--quotes</b> and one of the other options is set, <b>--lquote</b> or <b>--rquote</b> overrides
           <b>--quotes</b>.

       <b>-r</b> <u>version</u>, <b>--release</b>=<u>version</u>
           [1.00] Set the centered footer for the ".TH" macro to <u>version</u>.   By  default,  this  is  set  to  the
           version  of  Perl  you  run  <b>pod2man</b>  under.   Setting this to the empty string will cause some *roff
           implementations to use the system default value.

           Note that some system "an" macro sets assume that the centered footer will be a modification date and
           will prepend something like "Last modified: ".  If this is the case for your target system,  you  may
           want to set <b>--release</b> to the last modified date and <b>--date</b> to the version number.

       <b>-s</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--section</b>=<u>string</u>
           [1.00]  Set  the  section for the ".TH" macro.  The standard section numbering convention is to use 1
           for user commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for functions, 4 for devices, 5  for  file  formats,  6  for
           games,  7  for  miscellaneous  information,  and  8  for  administrator  commands.  There is a lot of
           variation here, however; some systems (like Solaris) use 4 for  file  formats,  5  for  miscellaneous
           information,  and  7  for devices.  Still others use 1m instead of 8, or some mix of both.  About the
           only section numbers that are reliably consistent are 1, 2, and 3.

           By default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends in ".pm", in which case  section  3  will  be
           selected.

       <b>--stderr</b>
           [2.1.3]  By  default, <b>pod2man</b> dies if any errors are detected in the POD input.  If <b>--stderr</b> is given
           and no <b>--errors</b> flag is present, errors are sent to standard error, but <b>pod2man</b> does not abort.  This
           is equivalent to "--errors=stderr" and is supported for backward compatibility.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--utf8</b>
           [2.1.0] This option used to tell <b>pod2man</b> to produce UTF-8 output.  Since this is now the  default  as
           of version 5.00, it is ignored and does nothing.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           [1.11] Print out the name of each output file as it is being generated.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       As  long  as  all  documents processed result in some output, even if that output includes errata (a "POD
       ERRORS" section generated with "--errors=pod"), <b>pod2man</b> will exit with status 0.  If any of the documents
       being processed do not result in an output document, <b>pod2man</b> will exit  with  status  1.   If  there  are
       syntax  errors  in  a  POD document being processed and the error handling style is set to the default of
       "die", <b>pod2man</b> will abort immediately with exit status 255.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       If <b>pod2man</b> fails with errors, see Pod::Man and Pod::Simple for information about what those errors  might
       mean.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
           pod2man program &gt; program.1
           pod2man SomeModule.pm /usr/perl/man/man3/SomeModule.3
           pod2man --section=7 note.pod &gt; note.7

       If  you  would  like  to  print  out a lot of man page continuously, you probably want to set the C and D
       registers to set contiguous page numbering and even/odd paging, at least on some versions of <b><a href="../man7/man.7.html">man</a></b>(7).

           troff -man -rC1 -rD1 perl.1 perldata.1 perlsyn.1 ...

       To get index entries on "STDERR", turn on the F register, as in:

           troff -man -rF1 perl.1

       The indexing merely outputs messages via ".tm" for each major page, section, subsection,  item,  and  any
       "X&lt;&gt;" directives.
