</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xfontsel - point and click selection of X11 font names

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xfontsel</b> [-<u>toolkitoption</u> ...] [<b>-help</b>] [<b>-pattern</b> <u>fontname</u>] [<b>-print</b>]
                [<b>-sample</b> <u>text</u>] [<b>-sample16</b> <u>text16</u>] [<b>-sampleUCS</b> <u>textUCS</u>]
                [<b>-scaled</b>] [<b>-version</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>xfontsel</u>  application  provides  a  simple  way to display the fonts known to your X server, examine
       samples of each, and retrieve the X Logical Font Description ("XLFD") full name for a font.

       If <b>-pattern</b> is not specified, all fonts with XLFD 14-part names will be selectable.  To work with only  a
       subset  of  the  fonts,  specify  <b>-pattern</b>  followed  by  a partially or fully qualified font name; e.g.,
       ``-pattern *medium*'' will select that subset of fonts which contain the string ``medium''  somewhere  in
       their font name.  Be careful about escaping wildcard characters in your shell.

       If <b>-print</b> is specified on the command line the selected font specifier will be written to standard output
       when the <u>quit</u> button is activated.  Regardless of whether or not <b>-print</b> was specified, the font specifier
       may be made the PRIMARY (text) selection by activating the <u>select</u> button.

       The  <b>-sample</b>  option  specifies  the  sample  text to be used to display the selected font if the font is
       linearly indexed, overriding the default.

       The <b>-sample16</b> option specifies the sample text to be used to display the selected font  if  the  font  is
       matrix encoded, overriding the default.

       The  <b>-sampleUCS</b>  option  specifies  the  sample  text encoded in the UTF-8 form to be used to display the
       selected font if the font has a CHARSET_REGISTRY of ISO10646, overriding the default.

       The <b>-scaled</b> option enables the ability to select scaled fonts at arbitrary pixel or point sizes.

       The <b>-help</b> option specifies that <u>xfontsel</u> should print a usage message and exit.

       The <b>-version</b> option specifies that <u>xfontsel</u> should print version info and exit.

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Clicking any pointer button in one of the XLFD field names will pop up  a  menu  of  the  currently-known
       possibilities for that field.  If previous choices of other fields were made, only values for fonts which
       matched  the  previously  selected  fields  will be selectable; to make other values selectable, you must
       deselect some other field(s) by choosing the ``*'' entry in  that  field.   Unselectable  values  may  be
       omitted  from  the  menu  entirely  as  a configuration option; see the <b>ShowUnselectable</b> resource, below.
       Whenever any change is made to a  field  value,  <u>xfontsel</u>  will  assert  ownership  of  the  PRIMARY_FONT
       selection.  Other applications (see, e.g., <u>xterm</u>) may then retrieve the selected font specification.

       Scalable  fonts  come  back  from  the server with zero for the pixel size, point size, and average width
       fields.  Selecting a font name with a zero in these  positions  results  in  an  implementation-dependent
       size.  Any pixel or point size can be selected to scale the font to a particular size.  Any average width
       can  be  selected to anamorphically scale the font (although you may find this challenging given the size
       of the average width menu).

       Clicking the left pointer button in the <u>select</u> widget will cause the  currently  selected  font  name  to
       become  the  PRIMARY text selection as well as the PRIMARY_FONT selection.  This then allows you to paste
       the string into other applications.  The <b>select</b> button remains highlighted to remind you  of  this  fact,
       and  de-highlights  when some other application takes the PRIMARY selection away.  The <u>select</u> widget is a
       toggle; pressing it when it is highlighted will cause <u>xfontsel</u> to release the selection ownership and de-
       highlight the widget.  Activating the <u>select</u> widget twice is the only way to cause  <u>xfontsel</u>  to  release
       the PRIMARY_FONT selection.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       The application class is <b>XFontSel</b>.  Most of the user-interface is configured in the app-defaults file; if
       this  file  is missing a warning message will be printed to standard output and the resulting window will
       be nearly incomprehensible.

       Most of the significant parts of the widget hierarchy are documented in <u>/etc/X11/app-defaults/XFontSel</u>,

       Application specific resources:

       <b>cursor</b> <b>(</b>class <b>Cursor)</b>
               Specifies the cursor for the application window.

       <b>pattern</b> <b>(</b>class <b>Pattern)</b>
               Specifies the font name pattern for selecting a subset of available  fonts.   Equivalent  to  the
               <b>-pattern</b>  option.  Most useful patterns will contain at least one field delimiter; e.g. ``*-m-*''
               for monospaced fonts.

       <b>pixelSizeList</b> <b>(</b>class <b>PixelSizeList)</b>
               Specifies a list of pixel sizes to add to the pixel size menu, so  that  scalable  fonts  can  be
               selected at those pixel sizes.  The default pixelSizeList contains 7, 30, 40, 50, and 60.

       <b>pointSizeList</b> <b>(</b>class <b>PointSizeList)</b>
               Specifies  a list of point sizes (in units of tenths of points) to add to the point size menu, so
               that scalable fonts can be selected at those point sizes.   The  default  pointSizeList  contains
               250, 300, 350, and 400.

       <b>printOnQuit</b> <b>(</b>class <b>PrintOnQuit)</b>
               If  <u>True</u>  the  currently selected font name is printed to standard output when the quit button is
               activated.  Equivalent to the <b>-print</b> option.

       <b>sampleText</b> <b>(</b>class <b>Text)</b>
               The sample 1-byte text to use for linearly indexed fonts.  Each glyph index  is  a  single  byte,
               with newline separating lines.

       <b>sampleText16</b> <b>(</b>class <b>Text16)</b>
               The  sample  2-byte  text to use for matrix-encoded fonts.  Each glyph index is two bytes, with a
               1-byte newline separating lines.

       <b>scaledFonts</b> <b>(</b>class <b>ScaledFonts)</b>
               If <u>True</u> then selection of arbitrary pixel and point sizes for scalable fonts is enabled.

       Widget specific resources:

       <b>showUnselectable</b> <b>(</b>class <b>ShowUnselectable)</b>
               Specifies, for each field menu, whether or not to show values that are not currently  selectable,
               based  upon  previous field selections.  If shown, the unselectable values are clearly identified
               as such and do not highlight when the pointer is moved down the menu.   The  full  name  of  this
               resource               is               <b>fieldN.menu.options.showUnselectable</b>,               class
               <b>MenuButton.SimpleMenu.Options.ShowUnselectable</b>;  where  N  is  replaced  with  the  field  number
               (starting  with  the  left-most  field  numbered  0).   The  default is True for all but field 11
               (average width of characters in font) and  False  for  field  11.   If  you  never  want  to  see
               unselectable  entries, '*menu.options.showUnselectable:False' is a reasonable thing to specify in
               a resource file.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Sufficiently ambiguous patterns can be misinterpreted and lead to an initial selection string  which  may
       not  correspond  to  what the user intended and which may cause the initial sample text output to fail to
       match the proffered string.  Selecting any new  field  value  will  correct  the  sample  output,  though
       possibly resulting in no matching font.

       Should be able to return a FONT for the PRIMARY selection, not just a STRING.

       Any  change  in  a  field  value  will  cause <u>xfontsel</u> to assert ownership of the PRIMARY_FONT selection.
       Perhaps this should be parameterized.

       When running on a slow machine, it is possible for the user to request a field menu before the font names
       have been completely parsed.  An error message indicating  a  missing  menu  is  printed  to  stderr  but
       otherwise nothing bad (or good) happens.

       The average-width menu is too large to be useful.
