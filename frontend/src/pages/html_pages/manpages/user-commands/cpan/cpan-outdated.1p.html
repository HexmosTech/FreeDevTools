</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cpan-outdated - detect outdated CPAN modules in your environment

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # print a list of distributions that contain outdated modules
           % cpan-outdated

           # print a list of outdated modules in packages
           % cpan-outdated -p

           # verbose
           % cpan-outdated --verbose
           .
           # ignore core modules (do not update dual life modules)
           % cpan-outdated --exclude-core

           # alternate mirrors
           % cpan-outdated --mirror file:///home/user/minicpan/

           # additional module path(same as cpanminus)
           % cpan-outdated -l extlib/
           % cpan-outdated -L extlib/

           # install with cpan
           % cpan-outdated | xargs cpan -i

           # install with cpanm
           % cpan-outdated    | cpanm
           % cpan-outdated -p | cpanm

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This script prints a list of outdated CPAN modules on your machine.

       This is the same feature as 'CPAN::Shell-&gt;r', but "cpan-outdated" is much faster and uses less memory.

       This script can be integrated with the cpanm command.

</pre><h4><b>PRINTING</b> <b>PACKAGES</b> <b>VS</b> <b>DISTRIBUTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This script by default prints the outdated distribution as in the CPAN distro format, i.e:
       "A/AU/AUTHOR/Distribution-Name-0.10.tar.gz" so you can pipe it into CPAN installers, but with the "-p"
       option it can be tweaked to print the module's package names.

       If you wish to manage a set of modules separately from your system perl installation and not install
       newer versions of "dual life modules" that are distributed with perl, the "--exclude-core" option will
       make cpan-outdated ignore changes to core modules. Used with tools like cpanm and its "-L
       --local-lib-contained" and "--self-contained" options, this facilitates maintaining updates on standalone
       sets of modules.

       For some tools, such as cpanm, installing from packages could be a bit more useful since you can track to
       see the old version number which you upgrade from.
