</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bts - developers' command line interface to the Debian Bug Tracking System

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bts</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u> [<u>args</u>] [<b>#</b><u>comment</u>] [<b>.</b>|<b>,</b> <u>command</u> [<u>args</u>] [<b>#</b><u>comment</u>]] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a command line interface to the Debian Bug Tracking System (BTS), intended mainly for use by
       developers. It lets the BTS be manipulated using simple commands that can be run at the prompt or in a
       script, does various sanity checks on the input, and constructs and sends a mail to the BTS control
       address for you. A local cache of web pages and e-mails from the BTS may also be created and updated.

       In general, the command line interface is the same as what you would write in a mail to
       <a href="mailto:control@bugs.debian.org">control@bugs.debian.org</a>, just prefixed with "bts". For example:

        % bts severity 69042 normal
        % bts merge 69042 43233
        % bts retitle 69042 blah blah

       A few additional commands have been added for your convenience, and this program is less strict about
       what constitutes a valid bug number. For example, "severity Bug#85942 normal" is understood, as is
       "severity #85942 normal".  (Of course, your shell may regard "#" as a comment character though, so you
       may need to quote it!)

       Also, for your convenience, this program allows you to abbreviate commands to the shortest unique
       substring (similar to how cvs lets you abbreviate commands). So it understands things like "bts cl
       85942".

       It is also possible to include a comment in the mail sent to the BTS. If your shell does not strip out
       the comment in a command like "bts severity 30321 normal #inflated severity", then this program is smart
       enough to figure out where the comment is, and include it in the email.  Note that most shells do strip
       out such comments before they get to the program, unless the comment is quoted.  (Something like "bts
       severity #85942 normal" will not be treated as a comment!)

       You can specify multiple commands by separating them with a single dot, rather like <b>update-rc.d</b>; a single
       comma may also be used; all the commands will then be sent in a single mail. It is important the
       dot/comma is surrounded by whitespace so it is not mistaken for part of a command.  For example (quoting
       where necessary so that <b>bts</b> sees the comment):

        % bts severity 95672 normal , merge 95672 95673 \#they are the same!

       The abbreviation "it" may be used to refer to the last mentioned bug number, so you could write:

        % bts severity 95672 wishlist , retitle it "bts: please add a --foo option"

       Please use this program responsibly, and do take our users into consideration.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bts</b> examines the <b>devscripts</b> configuration files as described below.  Command line options override the
       configuration file settings, though.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--offline</b>
           Make  <b>bts</b>  use  cached bugs for the <b>show</b> and <b>bugs</b> commands, if a cache is available for the requested
           data. See the <b>cache</b> command, below for information on setting up a cache.

       <b>--online</b>, <b>--no-offline</b>
           Opposite of <b>--offline</b>; overrides any configuration file directive to work offline.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-action</b>
           Do not send emails but print them to standard output.

       <b>--cache</b>, <b>--no-cache</b>
           Should we attempt to cache new versions of BTS pages when performing <b>show</b>/<b>bugs</b> commands?  Default  is
           to cache.

       <b>--cache-mode=</b>{<b>min</b>|<b>mbox</b>|<b>full</b>}
           When running a <b>bts</b> <b>cache</b> command, should we only mirror the basic bug (<b>min</b>), or should we also mirror
           the  mbox  version  (<b>mbox</b>),  or  should  we mirror the whole thing, including the mbox and the boring
           attachments to the BTS bug pages and the acknowledgement emails (<b>full</b>)?  Default is <b>min</b>.

       <b>--cache-delay=</b><u>seconds</u>
           Time in seconds to delay between each download, to avoid hammering the BTS web server. Default  is  5
           seconds.

       <b>--mbox</b>
           Open a mail reader to read the mbox corresponding to a given bug number for <b>show</b> and <b>bugs</b> commands.

       <b>--mailreader=</b><u>READER</u>
           Specify the command to read the mbox.  Must contain a "<b>%s</b>" string (unquoted!), which will be replaced
           by  the  name of the mbox file.  The command will be split on white space and will not be passed to a
           shell.  Default is '<b>mutt</b> <b>-f</b> <b>%s</b>'.  (Also, <b>%%</b> will be substituted by a single <b>%</b> if this is needed.)

       <b>--cc-addr=</b><u>CC_EMAIL_ADDRESS</u>
           Send carbon copies to a list of users. <u>CC_EMAIL_ADDRESS</u> should be a  comma-separated  list  of  email
           addresses. Multiple options add more CCs.

       <b>--use-default-cc</b>
           Add  the  addresses  specified  in the configuration file option <b>BTS_DEFAULT_CC</b> to the list specified
           using <b>--cc-addr</b>.  This is the default.

       <b>--no-use-default-cc</b>
           Do not add addresses specified in <b>BTS_DEFAULT_CC</b> to the carbon copy list.

       <b>--sendmail=</b><u>SENDMAILCMD</u>
           Specify the <b>sendmail</b> command.  The command will be split on white space and will not be passed  to  a
           shell.   Default  is <u>/usr/sbin/sendmail</u>.  The <b>-t</b> option will be automatically added if the command is
           <u>/usr/sbin/sendmail</u> or <u>/usr/sbin/exim*</u>.  For other mailers, if they require a <b>-t</b> option, this must  be
           included in the <u>SENDMAILCMD</u>, for example: <b>--sendmail="/usr/sbin/mymailer</b> <b>-t"</b>.

       <b>--mutt</b>
           Use <b>mutt</b> for sending of mails. Default is not to use <b>mutt</b>, except for some commands.

           Note  that  one  of  <b>$DEBEMAIL</b>  or <b>$EMAIL</b> must be set in the environment in order to use <b>mutt</b> to send
           emails.

       <b>--no-mutt</b>
           Don't use <b>mutt</b> for sending of mails.

       <b>--soap-timeout=</b><u>SECONDS</u>
           Specify a timeout for SOAP calls as used by the <b>select</b> and <b>status</b> commands.

       <b>--smtp-host=</b><u>SMTPHOST</u>
           Specify an SMTP host.  If given, <b>bts</b> will send mail by talking directly to this SMTP host rather than
           by invoking a <b>sendmail</b> command.

           The host name may be followed by a colon (":") and a port number in order to use a  port  other  than
           the default.  It may also begin with "ssmtp://" or "smtps://" to indicate that SMTPS should be used.

           If SMTPS not specified, <b>bts</b> will still try to use STARTTLS if it's advertised by the SMTP host.

           Note  that  one  of  <b>$DEBEMAIL</b>  or  <b>$EMAIL</b> must be set in the environment in order to use direct SMTP
           connections to send emails.

           Note that when sending directly via an SMTP host, specifying addresses in <b>--cc-addr</b> or <b>BTS_DEFAULT_CC</b>
           that the SMTP host will not relay will cause the SMTP host to reject the entire mail.

           Note also that the use of the <b>reassign</b> command may, when either <b>--mutt</b> or <b>--force-interactive</b> mode is
           enabled, lead to the automatic addition of a Cc to <u>$newpackage</u>@packages.debian.org.  In these  cases,
           the   note   above   regarding   relaying   applies.    The   submission   interface  (port  587)  on
           reportbug.debian.org does not support relaying and, as such, should not be used as an SMTP server for
           <b>bts</b> under the circumstances described in this paragraph.

       <b>--smtp-username=</b><u>USERNAME</u>, <b>--smtp-password=</b><u>PASSWORD</u>
           Specify the credentials to use when connecting to the SMTP server specified by <b>--smtp-host</b>.   If  the
           server does not require authentication then these options should not be used.

           If  a  username  is specified but not a password, <b>bts</b> will prompt for the password before sending the
           mail.

       <b>--smtp-helo=</b><u>HELO</u>
           Specify the name to use in the <u>HELO</u> command when connecting to  the  SMTP  server;  defaults  to  the
           contents of the file <u>/etc/mailname</u>, if it exists.

           Note  that  some  SMTP servers may reject the use of a <u>HELO</u> which either does not resolve or does not
           appear to belong to the host using it.

       <b>--bts-server</b>
           Use a debbugs server other than https://bugs.debian.org.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force-refresh</b>
           Download a bug report again, even if it does not appear to have changed since the last <b>cache</b> command.
           Useful if a <b>--cache-mode=full</b> is requested for the first time (otherwise unchanged bug  reports  will
           not be downloaded again, even if the boring bits have not been downloaded).

       <b>--no-force-refresh</b>
           Suppress any configuration file <b>--force-refresh</b> option.

       <b>--only-new</b>
           Download only new bugs when caching. Do not check for updates in bugs we already have.

       <b>--include-resolved</b>
           When caching bug reports, include those that are marked as resolved.  This is the default behaviour.

       <b>--no-include-resolved</b>
           Reverse  the  behaviour  of  the  previous  option.   That  is,  do not cache bugs that are marked as
           resolved.

       <b>--no-ack</b>
           Suppress acknowledgment mails from the BTS.  Note that this will only affect the copies  of  messages
           CCed to bugs, not those sent to the control bot.

       <b>--ack</b>
           Do not suppress acknowledgement mails.  This is the default behaviour.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--interactive</b>
           Before  sending  an  e-mail to the control bot, display the content and allow it to be edited, or the
           sending cancelled.

       <b>--force-interactive</b>
           Similar to <b>--interactive</b>, with  the  exception  that  an  editor  is  spawned  before  prompting  for
           confirmation of the message to be sent.

       <b>--no-interactive</b>
           Send control e-mails without confirmation.  This is the default behaviour.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           When  running  <b>bts</b>  <b>cache</b>,  only  display  information  about newly cached pages, not messages saying
           already cached.  If this option is specified twice, only output error messages (to stderr).

       <b>--no-conf</b>, <b>--noconf</b>
           Do not read any configuration files.  This can only be used as the first option given on the command-
           line.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       For     full     details     about      the      commands,      see      the      BTS      documentation.
       &lt;https://www.debian.org/Bugs/server-control&gt;

       <b>show</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>bug</u> <u>number</u> | <u>package</u> | <u>maintainer</u> | <b>:</b> ] [<u>opt</u><b>=</b><u>val</u> ...]
       <b>show</b> [<u>options</u>] [<b>src:</b><u>package</u> | <b>from:</b><u>submitter</u>] [<u>opt</u><b>=</b><u>val</u> ...]

       <b>show</b> [<b>release-critical</b> | <b>release-critical/</b>... | <b>RC</b>]
           This is a synonym for <b>bts</b> <b>bugs</b>.

       <b>bugs</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>bug_number</u> | <u>package</u> | <u>maintainer</u> | <b>:</b> ] [<u>opt</u><b>=</b><u>val</u> ...]
       <b>bugs</b> [<u>options</u>] [<b>src:</b><u>package</u> | <b>from:</b><u>submitter</u>] [<u>opt</u><b>=</b><u>val</u> ...]
       <b>bugs</b> [<u>options</u>] [<b>tag:</b><u>tag</u> | <b>usertag:</b><u>tag</u> ] [<u>opt</u><b>=</b><u>val</u> ...]
       <b>bugs</b> [<b>release-critical</b> | <b>release-critical/</b>... | <b>RC</b>]
           Display the page listing the requested bugs in a web browser using <b><a href="../man1/sensible-browser.1.html">sensible-browser</a></b>(1).

           Options  may be specified after the <b>bugs</b> command in addition to or instead of options at the start of
           the  command  line:  recognised  options  at  this  point  are:   <b>-o</b>/<b>--offline</b>/<b>--online</b>,   <b>-m</b>/<b>--mbox</b>,
           <b>--mailreader</b>  and  <b>--</b>[<b>no-</b>]<b>cache</b>.   These  are described earlier in this manpage.  If either the <b>-o</b> or
           <b>--offline</b> option is used, or there is already an up-to-date copy  in  the  local  cache,  the  cached
           version will be used.

           The meanings of the possible arguments are as follows:

           (none)  If  nothing  is  specified, <b>bts</b> <b>bugs</b> will display your bugs, assuming that either <b>DEBEMAIL</b> or
                   <b>EMAIL</b> (examined in that order) is set to the appropriate email address.

           <u>bug_number</u>
                   Display bug number <u>bug_number</u>.

           <u>package</u> Display the bugs for the package <u>package</u>.

           <b>src:</b><u>package</u>
                   Display the bugs for the source package <u>package</u>.

           <u>maintainer</u>
                   Display the bugs for the maintainer email address <u>maintainer</u>.

           <b>from:</b><u>submitter</u>
                   Display the bugs for the submitter email address <u>submitter</u>.

           <b>tag:</b><u>tag</u> Display the bugs which are tagged with <u>tag</u>.

           <b>usertag:</b><u>tag</u>
                   Display the bugs which are tagged with usertag <u>tag</u>.   See  the  BTS  documentation  for  more
                   information on usertags.  This will require the use of a <b>users=</b><u>email</u> option.

           <b>:</b>       Details  of  the  bug tracking system itself, along with a bug-request page with more options
                   than this script, can be found on https://bugs.debian.org/.  This page itself will be  opened
                   if the command 'bts bugs :' is used.

           <b>release-critical</b>, <b>RC</b>
                   Display  the  front  page  of  the  release-critical pages on the BTS.  This is a synonym for
                   https://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/index.html.    It   is   also   possible   to    say
                   release-critical/debian/main.html     and    the    like.     RC    is    a    synonym    for
                   release-critical/other/all.html.

           After the argument specifying what to display, you can optionally specify options to  use  to  format
           the  page  or  change  what  it  displayed.   These  are passed to the BTS in the URL downloaded. For
           example, pass dist=stable to see bugs affecting the stable version of a package, version=1.0  to  see
           bugs  affecting  that  version of a package, or reverse=yes to display newest messages first in a bug
           log.

           If caching has been enabled (that is, <b>--no-cache</b> has not been used, and <b>BTS_CACHE</b> has not been set to
           <b>no</b>), then any page requested by <b>bts</b> <b>show</b> will automatically  be  cached,  and  be  available  offline
           thereafter.   Pages  which  are  automatically  cached in this way will be deleted on subsequent "<b>bts</b>
           <b>show</b>|<b>bugs</b>|<b>cache</b>" invocations if they have not been accessed in 30 days.   Warning:  on  a  filesystem
           mounted  with  the  "noatime" option, running "<b>bts</b> <b>show</b>|<b>bugs</b>" does not update the cache files' access
           times; a cached bug will then be subject to auto-cleaning 30 days after its initial download, even if
           it has been accessed in the meantime.

           Any other <b>bts</b> commands following this on the command line will be executed after the browser has been
           exited.

           The desired browser can be specified and configured by setting the <b>BROWSER</b> environment variable.  The
           conventions follow those defined  by  Eric  Raymond  at  <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/BROWSER/">http://www.catb.org/~esr/BROWSER/</a>;  we  here
           reproduce the relevant part.

           The  value  of <b>BROWSER</b> may consist of a colon-separated series of browser command parts. These should
           be tried in order until one succeeds. Each command part may optionally contain the string <b>%s</b>;  if  it
           does,  the  URL to be viewed is substituted there. If a command part does not contain <b>%s</b>, the browser
           is to be launched as if the URL had been supplied as its  first  argument.  The  string  <b>%%</b>  must  be
           substituted as a single %.

           Rationale:  We  need  to  be  able  to  specify  multiple  browser  commands so programs obeying this
           convention can do the right thing in either X or console environments,  trying  X  first.  Specifying
           multiple  commands  may  also  be  useful  for  people  who share files like <u>.profile</u> across multiple
           systems. We need <b>%s</b> because some popular browsers have remote-invocation  syntax  that  requires  it.
           Unless <b>%%</b> reduces to %, it won't be possible to have a literal <b>%s</b> in the string.

           For example, on most Linux systems a good thing to do would be:

           BROWSER='mozilla -raise -remote "openURL(%s,new-window)":links'

       <b>select</b> [<u>key</u><b>:</b><u>value</u> ...]
           Uses the SOAP interface to output a list of bugs which match the given selection requirements.

           The following keys are allowed, and may be given multiple times.

           <b>package</b> Binary package name.

           <b>source</b>  Source package name.

           <b>maintainer</b>
                   E-mail address of the maintainer.

           <b>submitter</b>
                   E-mail address of the submitter.

           <b>severity</b>
                   Bug severity.

           <b>status</b>  Status of the bug.  One of <b>open</b>, <b>done</b>, or <b>forwarded</b>.

           <b>tag</b>     Tags  applied  to  the  bug.  If  <b>users</b> is specified, may include usertags in addition to the
                   standard tags.

           <b>owner</b>   Bug's owner.

           <b>correspondent</b>
                   Address of someone who sent mail to the log.

           <b>affects</b> Bugs which affect this package.

           <b>bugs</b>    List of bugs to search within.

           <b>users</b>   Users to use when looking up usertags.

           <b>archive</b> Whether to search archived bugs or normal bugs; defaults to <b>0</b> (i.e. only search normal bugs).
                   As a special case, if archive is <b>both</b>, both archived and unarchived bugs are returned.

           For example, to select the set of bugs submitted by <a href="mailto:jrandomdeveloper@example.com">jrandomdeveloper@example.com</a> and tagged  <b>wontfix</b>,
           one would use

           bts select submitter:<a href="mailto:jrandomdeveloper@example.com">jrandomdeveloper@example.com</a> tag:wontfix

           If  a  key  is  used  multiple times then the set of bugs selected includes those matching any of the
           supplied values; for example

           bts select package:foo severity:wishlist severity:minor

           returns all bugs of package foo with either wishlist or minor severity.

       <b>status</b> [<u>bug</u> | <b>file:</b><u>file</u> | <b>fields:</b><u>field</u>[<b>,</b><u>field</u> ...] | <b>verbose</b>] ...
           Uses the SOAP interface to output status information for the given bugs (or as read from  the  listed
           files -- use <b>-</b> to indicate STDIN).

           By default, all populated fields for a bug are displayed.

           If <b>verbose</b> is given, empty fields will also be displayed.

           If  <b>fields</b>  is  given, only those fields will be displayed.  No validity checking is performed on any
           specified fields.

       <b>clone</b> <u>bug</u> <u>new_ID</u> [<u>new_ID</u> ...]
           The <b>clone</b> control command allows you to duplicate a <u>bug</u> report. It is useful  in  the  case  where  a
           single  report  actually  indicates that multiple distinct bugs have occurred. "New IDs" are negative
           numbers, separated by spaces, which may be used in subsequent control commands to refer to the  newly
           duplicated bugs.  A new report is generated for each new ID.

       <b>done</b> <u>bug</u> [<u>version</u>]
           Mark  a  <u>bug</u>  as Done. This forces interactive mode since done messages should include an explanation
           why the bug is being closed.  You should specify which <u>version</u> of the  package  closed  the  bug,  if
           possible.

       <b>reopen</b> <u>bug</u> [<u>submitter</u>]
           Reopen a <u>bug</u>, with optional <u>submitter</u>.

       <b>archive</b> <u>bug</u>
           Archive  a  <u>bug</u>  that has previously been archived but is currently not.  The <u>bug</u> must fulfill all of
           the requirements for archiving with the exception of those that are time-based.

       <b>unarchive</b> <u>bug</u>
           Unarchive a <u>bug</u> that is currently archived.

       <b>retitle</b> <u>bug</u> <u>title</u>
           Change the <u>title</u> of the <u>bug</u>.

       <b>summary</b> <u>bug</u> [<u>messagenum</u>]
           Select a message number that should be used as the summary of a <u>bug</u>.

           If no message number is given, the summary is cleared.

       <b>submitter</b> <u>bug</u> [<u>bug</u> ...] <u>submitter-email</u>
           Change the submitter address of a <u>bug</u> or a number of bugs, with <b>!</b> meaning "use  the  address  on  the
           current email as the new submitter address".

       <b>reassign</b> <u>bug</u> [<u>bug</u> ...] <u>package</u> [<u>version</u>]
           Reassign  a  <u>bug</u>  or a number of bugs to a different <u>package</u>.  The <u>version</u> field is optional; see the
           explanation at &lt;https://www.debian.org/Bugs/server-control&gt;.

       <b>found</b> <u>bug</u> [<u>version</u>]
           Indicate that a <u>bug</u> was found to exist in a particular package version.  Without <u>version</u>, the list of
           fixed versions is cleared and the bug is reopened.

       <b>notfound</b> <u>bug</u> <u>version</u>
           Remove the record that <u>bug</u> was encountered in the given  version  of  the  package  to  which  it  is
           assigned.

       <b>fixed</b> <u>bug</u> <u>version</u>
           Indicate  that  a  <u>bug</u>  was  fixed  in  a  particular  package  version,  without affecting the <u>bug</u>'s
           open/closed status.

       <b>notfixed</b> <u>bug</u> <u>version</u>
           Remove the record that a <u>bug</u> was fixed in the given version of the package to which it is assigned.

           This is equivalent to the sequence of commands "<b>found</b> <u>bug</u> <u>version</u>", "<b>notfound</b> <u>bug</u> <u>version</u>".

       <b>block</b> <u>bug</u> <b>by</b>|<b>with</b> <u>bug</u> [<u>bug</u> ...]
           Note that a <u>bug</u> is blocked from being fixed by a set of other bugs.

       <b>unblock</b> <u>bug</u> <b>by</b>|<b>with</b> <u>bug</u> [<u>bug</u> ...]
           Note that a <u>bug</u> is no longer blocked from being fixed by a set of other bugs.

       <b>merge</b> <u>bug</u> <u>bug</u> [<u>bug</u> ...]
           Merge a set of bugs together.

       <b>forcemerge</b> <u>bug</u> <u>bug</u> [<u>bug</u> ...]
           Forcibly merge a set of bugs together. The first <u>bug</u> listed is  the  master  bug,  and  its  settings
           (those which must be equal in a normal <b>merge</b>) are assigned to the bugs listed next.

       <b>unmerge</b> <u>bug</u>
           Unmerge a <u>bug</u>.

       <b>tag</b> <u>bug</u> [<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>|<b>=</b>] <u>tag</u> [<u>tag</u> ...]
       <b>tags</b> <u>bug</u> [<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>|<b>=</b>] <u>tag</u> [<u>tag</u> ...]
           Set or unset a <u>tag</u> on a <u>bug</u>. The tag may either be the exact tag name or it may be abbreviated to any
           unique  tag  substring.  (So using <b>fixed</b> will set the tag <b>fixed</b>, not <b>fixed-upstream</b>, for example, but
           <b>fix</b> would not be acceptable.) Multiple tags may be specified as well. The two commands (tag and tags)
           are identical. At least one tag must be specified, unless the <b>=</b> flag is used, where the command

             bts tags &lt;bug&gt; =

           will remove all tags from the specified <u>bug</u>.

           Adding/removing the <b>security</b> tag will add "<a href="mailto:team@security.debian.org">team@security.debian.org</a>" to the Cc list  of  the  control
           email.

           The     list     of     valid     tags     and     their     significance     is     available     at
           &lt;https://www.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#tags&gt;. The current valid tags are:

           patch, wontfix, moreinfo, unreproducible, fixed, help, security, upstream, pending,  d-i,  confirmed,
           ipv6, lfs, fixed-upstream, l10n, newcomer, a11y, ftbfs

           There  is  also  a  tag  for each release of Debian since "potato". Note that this list may be out of
           date, see the website for the most up to date source.

       <b>affects</b> <u>bug</u> [<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>|<b>=</b>] <u>package</u> [<u>package</u> ...]
           Indicates that a <u>bug</u> affects a <u>package</u> other than that against which it is filed, causing the <u>bug</u>  to
           be  listed  by default in the <u>package</u> list of the other <u>package</u>.  This should generally be used where
           the <u>bug</u> is severe enough to cause multiple reports from users to be assigned to  the  wrong  package.
           At least one <u>package</u> must be specified, unless the <b>=</b> flag is used, where the command

             bts affects &lt;bug&gt; =

           will remove all indications that <u>bug</u> affects other packages.

       <b>user</b> <u>email</u>
           Specify a user <u>email</u> address before using the <b>usertags</b> command.

       <b>usertag</b> <u>bug</u> [<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>|<b>=</b>] <u>tag</u> [<u>tag</u> ...]
       <b>usertags</b> <u>bug</u> [<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>|<b>=</b>] <u>tag</u> [<u>tag</u> ...]
           Set or unset a user tag on a <u>bug</u>. The <u>tag</u> must be the exact tag name wanted; there are no defaults or
           checking  of  tag  names.   Multiple  tags  may  be  specified as well. The two commands (<b>usertag</b> and
           <b>usertags</b>) are identical.  At least one <u>tag</u> must be specified, unless the <b>=</b> flag is  used,  where  the
           command

             bts usertags &lt;bug&gt; =

           will remove all user tags from the specified <u>bug</u>.

       <b>claim</b> <u>bug</u> [<u>claim</u>]
           Record  that you have claimed a <u>bug</u> (e.g. for a bug squashing party).  <u>claim</u> should be a unique token
           allowing the bugs you have claimed to be identified; an e-mail address is often used.

           If no <u>claim</u> is specified, the environment variable <b>DEBEMAIL</b> or <b>EMAIL</b> (checked in that order) is used.

       <b>unclaim</b> <u>bug</u> [<u>claim</u>]
           Remove the record that you have claimed a bug.

           If no <u>claim</u> is specified, the environment variable <b>DEBEMAIL</b> or <b>EMAIL</b> (checked in that order) is used.

       <b>severity</b> <u>bug</u> <u>severity</u>
           Change the <u>severity</u> of a <u>bug</u>. Available severities are: <b>wishlist</b>, <b>minor</b>, <b>normal</b>, <b>important</b>,  <b>serious</b>,
           <b>grave</b>, <b>critical</b>. The severity may be abbreviated to any unique substring.

       <b>forwarded</b> <u>bug</u> <u>address</u>
           Mark the <u>bug</u> as forwarded to the given <u>address</u> (usually an email address or a URL for an upstream bug
           tracker).

       <b>notforwarded</b> <u>bug</u>
           Mark a <u>bug</u> as not forwarded.

       <b>package</b> [<u>package</u> ...]
           The  following  commands  will  only apply to bugs against the listed <u>package</u>s; this acts as a safety
           mechanism for the BTS.  If no packages are listed, this check is turned off again.

       <b>limit</b> [<u>key</u>[<b>:</b><u>value</u>]] ...
           The following commands will only apply to bugs which meet the specified criterion;  this  acts  as  a
           safety mechanism for the BTS.  If no <u>value</u>s are listed, the limits for that <u>key</u> are turned off again.
           If no <u>key</u>s are specified, all limits are reset.

           <b>submitter</b>
                   E-mail address of the submitter.

           <b>date</b>    Date the bug was submitted.

           <b>subject</b> Subject of the bug.

           <b>msgid</b>   Message-id of the initial bug report.

           <b>package</b> Binary package name.

           <b>source</b>  Source package name.

           <b>tag</b>     Tags applied to the bug.

           <b>severity</b>
                   Bug severity.

           <b>owner</b>   Bug's owner.

           <b>affects</b> Bugs affecting this package.

           <b>archive</b> Whether to search archived bugs or normal bugs; defaults to <b>0</b> (i.e. only search normal bugs).
                   As a special case, if archive is <b>both</b>, both archived and unarchived bugs are returned.

           For  example, to limit the set of bugs affected by the subsequent control commands to those submitted
           by <a href="mailto:jrandomdeveloper@example.com">jrandomdeveloper@example.com</a> and tagged <b>wontfix</b>, one would use

           bts limit submitter:<a href="mailto:jrandomdeveloper@example.com">jrandomdeveloper@example.com</a> tag:wontfix

           If a key is used multiple times then the set of bugs selected includes  those  matching  any  of  the
           supplied values; for example

           bts limit package:foo severity:wishlist severity:minor

           only  applies  the  subsequent  control commands to bugs of package foo with either <b>wishlist</b> or <b>minor</b>
           severity.

       <b>owner</b> <u>bug</u> <u>owner-email</u>
           Change the "owner" address of a <u>bug</u>, with <b>!</b> meaning "use the address on the current email as the  new
           owner address".

           The owner of a bug accepts responsibility for dealing with it.

       <b>noowner</b> <u>bug</u>
           Mark a bug as having no "owner".

       <b>subscribe</b> <u>bug</u> [<u>email</u>]
           Subscribe the given <u>email</u> address to the specified <u>bug</u> report.  If no email address is specified, the
           environment  variable <b>DEBEMAIL</b> or <b>EMAIL</b> (in that order) is used.  If those are not set, or <b>!</b> is given
           as email address, your default address will be used.

           After executing this command, you will be sent a subscription  confirmation  to  which  you  have  to
           reply.   When subscribed to a bug report, you receive all relevant emails and notifications.  Use the
           unsubscribe command to unsubscribe.

       <b>unsubscribe</b> <u>bug</u> [<u>email</u>]
           Unsubscribe the given email address from the specified bug report.  As with subscribe  above,  if  no
           email  address is specified, the environment variables <b>DEBEMAIL</b> or <b>EMAIL</b> (in that order) is used.  If
           those are not set, or <b>!</b> is given as email address, your default address will be used.

           After executing this command, you will be sent an unsubscription confirmation to which  you  have  to
           reply. Use the <b>subscribe</b> command to, well, subscribe.

       <b>reportspam</b> <u>bug</u> ...
           The  <b>reportspam</b>  command  allows  you  to  report a <u>bug</u> report as containing spam.  It saves one from
           having to go to the bug web page to do so.

       <b>spamreport</b> <u>bug</u> ...
           <b>spamreport</b> is a synonym for <b>reportspam</b>.

       <b>cache</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>maint_email</u> | <u>pkg</u> | <b>src:</b><u>pkg</u> | <b>from:</b><u>submitter</u>]
       <b>cache</b> [<u>options</u>] [<b>release-critical</b> | <b>release-critical/</b>... | <b>RC</b>]
           Generate or update a cache of bug reports for the given email  address  or  package.  By  default  it
           downloads  all bugs belonging to the email address in the <b>DEBEMAIL</b> environment variable (or the <b>EMAIL</b>
           environment variable if <b>DEBEMAIL</b> is unset). This command may be repeated to cache bugs  belonging  to
           several  people or packages. If multiple packages or addresses are supplied, bugs belonging to any of
           the arguments will be cached; those belonging to  more  than  one  of  the  arguments  will  only  be
           downloaded  once. The cached bugs are stored in <u>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/devscripts/bts/</u> or, if <b>XDG_CACHE_HOME</b>
           is not set, in <u><a href="file:~/.cache/devscripts/bts/">~/.cache/devscripts/bts/</a></u>.

           You can use the cached bugs with the <b>-o</b> switch. For example:

             bts -o bugs
             bts -o show 12345

           Also, <b>bts</b> will update the files in it in a piecemeal fashion as it downloads information from the BTS
           using the <b>show</b> command. You might thus set up the cache, and update the  whole  thing  once  a  week,
           while letting the automatic cache updates update the bugs you frequently refer to during the week.

           Some  options  affect  the behaviour of the <b>cache</b> command.  The first is the setting of <b>--cache-mode</b>,
           which controls how much <b>bts</b> downloads of the referenced links from the  bug  page,  including  boring
           bits  such  as the acknowledgement emails, emails to the control bot, and the mbox version of the bug
           report.  It can take three values: <b>min</b> (the minimum),  <b>mbox</b>  (download  the  minimum  plus  the  mbox
           version  of  the  bug  report) or <b>full</b> (the whole works).  The second is <b>--force-refresh</b> or <b>-f</b>, which
           forces the download, even if the cached bug report  is  up-to-date.   The  <b>--include-resolved</b>  option
           indicates whether bug reports marked as resolved should be downloaded during caching.

           Each  of  these  is  configurable  from the configuration file, as described below.  They may also be
           specified after the <b>cache</b> command as well as at the start of the command line.

           Finally, <b>-q</b> or <b>--quiet</b> will suppress messages about caches being up-to-date, and  giving  the  option
           twice will suppress all cache messages (except for error messages).

           Beware of caching RC, though: it will take a LONG time!  (With 1000+ RC bugs and a delay of 5 seconds
           between bugs, you're looking at a minimum of 1.5 hours, and probably significantly more than that.)

       <b>cleancache</b> <u>package</u> | <b>src:</b><u>package</u> | <u>maintainer</u>
       <b>cleancache</b> <b>from:</b><u>submitter</u> | <b>tag:</b><u>tag</u> | <b>usertag:</b><u>tag</u> | <u>number</u> | <b>ALL</b>
           Clean the cache for the specified <u>package</u>, <u>maintainer</u>, etc., as described above for the <b>bugs</b> command,
           or  clean  the  entire  cache  if <b>ALL</b> is specified. This is useful if you are going to have permanent
           network access or if the database has become corrupted for some reason.  Note that for  safety,  this
           command does not default to the value of <b>DEBEMAIL</b> or <b>EMAIL</b>.

       <b>listcachedbugs</b> [<u>number</u>]
           List cached bug ids (intended to support bash completion). The optional number argument restricts the
           list to those bug ids that start with that number.

       <b>version</b>
           Display version and copyright information.

       <b>help</b>
           Display a short summary of commands, suspiciously similar to parts of this man page.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DEBEMAIL</b>
           If  this  is  set,  the From: line in the email will be set to use this email address instead of your
           normal email address (as would be determined by <b>mail</b>).

       <b>DEBFULLNAME</b>
           If <b>DEBEMAIL</b> is set, <b>DEBFULLNAME</b> is examined to determine the full name to use; if this  is  not  set,
           <b>bts</b> attempts to determine a name from your <u>passwd</u> entry.

       <b>BROWSER</b>
           If set, it specifies the browser to use for the <b>show</b> and <b>bugs</b> options.  See the description above.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  two  configuration files <u>/etc/devscripts.conf</u> and <u><a href="file:~/.devscripts">~/.devscripts</a></u> are sourced by a shell in that order
       to set configuration variables.  Command  line  options  can  be  used  to  override  configuration  file
       settings.   Environment  variable  settings  are  ignored  for  this  purpose.   The currently recognised
       variables are:

       <b>BTS_OFFLINE</b>
           If this is set to <b>yes</b>, then it is the same as the <b>--offline</b> command line parameter being used.   Only
           has  an  effect  on  the <b>show</b> and <b>bugs</b> commands.  The default is <b>no</b>.  See the description of the <b>show</b>
           command above for more information.

       <b>BTS_CACHE</b>
           If this is set to <b>no</b>, then it is the same as the <b>--no-cache</b> command line parameter being used.   Only
           has  an  effect on the <b>show</b> and <b>bug</b> commands.  The default is <b>yes</b>.  Again, see the <b>show</b> command above
           for more information.

       <b>BTS_CACHE_MODE=</b>{<b>min</b>,<b>mbox</b>,<b>full</b>}
           How much of the BTS should we mirror when we are asked to cache something?  Just the minimum, or also
           the mbox or the whole thing?  The default is <b>min</b>, and it has the same  meaning  as  the  <b>--cache-mode</b>
           command  line  parameter.   Only  has  an  effect  on  the  cache.   See  the  <b>cache</b> command for more
           information.

       <b>BTS_FORCE_REFRESH</b>
           If this is set to <b>yes</b>, then it is the same as the <b>--force-refresh</b> command line parameter being  used.
           Only  has  an  effect  on  the  <b>cache</b>  command.   The  default is <b>no</b>.  See the <b>cache</b> command for more
           information.

       <b>BTS_MAIL_READER</b>
           If this is set, specifies a mail reader to use instead of <b>mutt</b>.  Same  as  the  <b>--mailreader</b>  command
           line option.

       <b>BTS_SENDMAIL_COMMAND</b>
           If  this  is  set,  specifies  a  <b>sendmail</b> command to use instead of <u>/usr/sbin/sendmail</u>.  Same as the
           <b>--sendmail</b> command line option.

       <b>BTS_ONLY_NEW</b>
           Download only new bugs when caching. Do not check for updates in bugs we already have.   The  default
           is <b>no</b>.  Same as the <b>--only-new</b> command line option.

       <b>BTS_SMTP_HOST</b>
           If  this  is  set,  specifies  an  SMTP  host  to use for sending mail rather than using the <b>sendmail</b>
           command.  Same as the <b>--smtp-host</b> command line option.

           Note that this option takes priority over <b>BTS_SENDMAIL_COMMAND</b> if both are set, unless the <b>--sendmail</b>
           option is used.

       <b>BTS_SMTP_AUTH_USERNAME</b>, <b>BTS_SMTP_AUTH_PASSWORD</b>
           If these options are set, then it is the same as  the  <b>--smtp-username</b>  and  <b>--smtp-password</b>  options
           being used.

       <b>BTS_SMTP_HELO</b>
           Same as the <b>--smtp-helo</b> command line option.

       <b>BTS_INCLUDE_RESOLVED</b>
           If  this  is set to <b>no</b>, then it is the same as the <b>--no-include-resolved</b> command line parameter being
           used.  Only has an effect on the <b>cache</b> command.  The default is <b>yes</b>.  See the <b>cache</b> command for  more
           information.

       <b>BTS_SUPPRESS_ACKS</b>
           If  this  is  set to <b>yes</b>, then it is the same as the <b>--no-ack</b> command line parameter being used.  The
           default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>BTS_INTERACTIVE</b>
           If this is set to <b>yes</b> or <b>force</b>, then it is the  same  as  the  <b>--interactive</b>  or  <b>--force-interactive</b>
           command line parameter being used.  The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>BTS_DEFAULT_CC</b>
           Specify  a list of e-mail addresses to which a carbon copy of the generated e-mail to the control bot
           should automatically be sent.

       <b>BTS_SERVER</b>
           Specify the name of a debbugs server which should be used instead of https://bugs.debian.org.
