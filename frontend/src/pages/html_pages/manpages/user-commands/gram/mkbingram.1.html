</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
           mkbingram
          - make binary N-gram from ARPA N-gram file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>mkbingram</b> [-nlr <u>forward_ngram.arpa</u>] [-nrl <u>backward_ngram.arpa</u>] [-d <u>old_bingram_file</u>]
                 {output_bingram_file}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mkbingram</b> is a tool to convert N-gram definition file(s) in ARPA standard format to a compact Julius
       binary format. It will speed up the initial loading time of N-gram much faster. It can read gzipped file
       directly.

       From rev.4.0, Julius can deal with forward N-gram, backward N-gram and their combinations. So, <b>mkbingram</b>
       now generates binary N-gram file from one of them, or combining them two to produce one binary N-gram.

       When only a forward N-gram is specified, <b>mkbingram</b> generates binary N-gram from only the forward N-gram.
       When using this binary N-gram at Julius, it performs the 1st pass with the 2-gram probabilities in the
       N-gram, and run the 2nd pass with the given N-gram fully, with converting forward probabilities to
       backward probabilities by Bayes rule.

       When only a backward N-gram is specified, <b>mkbingram</b> generates an binary N-gram file that contains only
       the backward N-gram. The 1st pass will use forward 2-gram probabilities that can be computed from the
       backward 2-gram using Bayes rule, and the 2nd pass use the given backward N-gram fully.

       When both forward and backward N-grams are specified, the 2-gram part in the forward N-gram and all
       backward N-gram will be combined into single bingram file. The forward 2-gram will be applied for the 1st
       pass and backward N-gram for the 2nd pass. Note that both N-gram should be trained in the same corpus
       with same parameters (i.e. cut-off thresholds), with same vocabulary.

       The old binary N-gram produced by <b>mkbingram</b> of version 3.x and earlier can be used in Julius-4, but you
       can convert the old version to the new version by specifying it as input of current <b>mkbingram</b> by option
       "<b>-d</b>".

       Please note that binary N-gram file converted by <b>mkbingram</b> of version 4.0 and later cannot be read by
       older Julius 3.x.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
        <b>-nlr</b>  <u>forward_ngram.arpa</u>
          Read in a forward (left-to-right) word N-gram file in ARPA standard format.

        <b>-nrl</b>  <u>backward_ngram.arpa</u>
          Read in a backward (right-to-left) word N-gram file in ARPA standard format.

        <b>-d</b>  <u>old_bingram_file</u>
          Read in a binary N-gram file.

        <b>-swap</b>
          Swap BOS word &lt;s&gt; and EOS word &lt;/s&gt; in N-gram.

       <u>output_bingram_file</u>
          binary N-gram file name to output.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>

       Convert a single forward 4-gram in ARPA format into a binary file:
       Convert old binary N-gram file to current format:
