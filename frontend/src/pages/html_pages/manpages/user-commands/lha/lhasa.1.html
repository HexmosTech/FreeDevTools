</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lha - compression tool for .lzh archive files.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lha</b> [<b>-</b>]{<b>lvtxep</b>[<b>q</b>{<u>num</u>}][<b>finv</b>]}[<b>w=</b>&lt;<u>dir</u>&gt;] <u>archive_file</u> [<u>file</u> <u>...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lha</b>  is  a tool for extracting .lzh archive files. It also supports variants of the .lzh archive, such as
       .lzs and .pma.

       This version of the lha tool is part of Lhasa, a free implementation of the .lzh format.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The lha tool has an unusual command syntax, compared to most other Unix commands. The first parameter  to
       the  program  specifies the command to perform and all additional options. The second parameter specifies
       the path to the archive file to operate on. Following this is  a  list  of  wildcard  patterns  to  match
       against the filenames of the archived files.

       The  first  character  of  the  command  parameter  specifies the command to perform, which is one of the
       following:

       <b>-l</b>     List contents of the specified archive.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbosely list contents of the specified archive.

       <b>-t</b>     Test the integrity of the specified archive: decompress its contents and check the CRC.

       <b>-e</b> or <b>-x</b>
              Extract archive. Files are extracted to the current working directory unless  the  'w'  option  is
              specified.

       <b>-p</b>     Extract  archive,  sending decompressed files to stdout rather than writing them to the filesystem
              as actual files. This is useful when used as part of a shell pipeline.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The remainder of the command parameter is used to specify additional options:

       <b>q[012]</b> Quiet mode. Higher numbers suppress more output. Level 0 is normal  operation.  If  no  number  is
              specified,  full suppression (level 2) is used. The quiet option also turns on the force overwrite
              option ('f').

       <b>f</b>      Force overwrite of existing files: do not prompt.

       <b>i</b>      Ignore paths of archived files: extract  all  archived  files  to  the  same  directory,  ignoring
              subdirectories.

       <b>n</b>      Do  not  perform  any actual operations: instead, perform a dry run of the requested operation and
              describe what would have been done on standard output.

       <b>v</b>      Verbose mode: causes extra information to be written to standard output.

       <b>w=dir</b>  Specify destination directory for extracting files. This must be the  last  option  of  the  first
              parameter.

</pre><h4><b>COMPRESSION</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  gives  some  basic description of the various different supported compression formats (as
       listed when using the list command documented above).  All formats are variants on the  LZSS  compression
       algorithm.

       <b>-lz4-</b>  Uncompressed  (stored)  data,  as  used  by the original LArc tool. This is not related to the LZ4
              compression algorithm of the same name.

       <b>-lz5-</b>, <b>-lzs-</b>
              Compression formats introduced with the original LArc tool.  -lzs-  uses  a  2KiB  sliding  window
              while -lz5- uses a 4KiB window.

       <b>-lhd-</b>  Directory entry. No data is stored, only headers.

       <b>-lh0-</b>  Uncompressed (stored) data, as used in LHarc and LHa.

       <b>-lh1-</b>  Compression  algorithm introduced with LHarc. This uses a 4KiB sliding window with dynamic Huffman
              encoding.

       <b>-lh4-</b>, <b>-lh5-</b>, <b>-lh6-</b>, <b>-lh7-</b>
              New algorithm introduced with LHa (aka LHarc v2.0). The original versions (-lh4- and  -lh5-)  used
              8KiB  and  16KiB  sliding window sizes, respectively.  Later versions introduced new variants with
              larger window sizes: -lh6- (64KiB) and -lh7- (128KiB).

       <b>-lhx-</b>  Variant on the -lh4- format listed above introduced by UNLHA32.dll that extends the window size to
              1MiB.

       <b>-lk7-</b>  Variant on the -lh4- format listed above that was introduced by the LHark tool (a  fork  of  LHa).
              This  is  actually  named -lh7- within the archive files, but Lhasa renames it internally to avoid
              clashing with the other algorithm of the same name. Uses a 128KiB sliding window, with some  minor
              improvement to the algorithm.

       <b>-pm0-</b>  Uncompressed (stored) data, as used by the PMarc tool.

       <b>-pm1-</b>  Algorithm used by version 1 of the PMarc tool.

       <b>-pm2-</b>  Algorithm used by version 2 of the PMarc tool.

</pre><h4><b>UNSUPPORTED</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       The following formats are <b>not</b> currently supported by Lhasa (but possibly will be in the future):

       <b>-lh2-</b>, <b>-lh3-</b>
              These  formats  can  be decompressed by LHa v2.0 but the tool could not actually generate archives
              with these formats; they appear to have only been supported  in  beta  versions  before  the  v2.0
              release. As a result, few if any examples exist in the wild.

       <b>-lh8-</b>, <b>-lh9-</b>, <b>-lha-</b>, <b>-lhb-</b>, <b>-lhc-</b>, <b>-lhe-</b>
              Extensions of the -lh4- format to even larger window sizes.

       <b>-pc1-</b>  Format generated by the PopCom! compression utility for CP/M.

       If you encounter examples of these in the wild, please get in touch.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here are some examples for how to invoke the program:

       lha -v foobar.lzs
              List the contents of the file <b>foobar.lzs</b> (producing verbose output).

       lha -xf foobar.exe
              Extract  the contents of a self-extracting archive file named <b>foobar.exe</b> to the current directory,
              overwriting existing files with the same names if they exist.

       lha -xqw=<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> foobar.lzh
              Extract the contents of <b>foobar.lzh</b> to <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b>,  overwriting  any  existing  files  found  there,  and
              suppressing normal output (similar to how other Unix tools such as <b><a href="../man1/cp.1.html">cp</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a></b>(1) act silently by
              default).

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The  .lzh  format  originated  with  Kazuhiko  Miki's MS-DOS archive tool, LArc, using the LZSS algorithm
       developed by Haruhiko Okumura, and the .lzs filename extension.  The  container  format  was  reused  for
       LHarc,  by  Haruyasu Yoshizaki (Yoshi), which used a new algorithm named LZHUF and the .lzh extension. In
       later versions, LHarc was renamed to LHA and extended with more effective compression algorithms.

       Versions of the LHA tool were later ported to various different operating systems, including  the  Amiga,
       Atari,  MacOS,  OS/2  and  Unix.   A  tool for MSX-DOS named PMarc reused the container format with a new
       compression algorithm (.pma extension).

       The Unix version of the tool was developed by Masaru Oki, Nobutaka Watazaki and Tsugio Okamoto,  but  was
       released  under a software license that does not conform to the Free Software or Open Source Definitions.
       Lhasa was developed as a drop-in replacement that is Free Software and Open Source.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The current version does not allow the creation of new archive files.

       Some obscure compression algorithms are not currently supported  (see  the  UNSUPPORTED  FORMATS  section
       above).

       The  tool  does not currently do text format conversion for non-ASCII filenames when listing the contents
       of archives. Non-ASCII characters are replaced by a question mark.
