</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       osmium-tags-filter - filter objects matching specified keys/tags

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>osmium</b> <b>tags-filter</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>OSM-FILE</u> <u>FILTER-EXPRESSION</u>...
       <b>osmium</b> <b>tags-filter</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] --expressions=<u>FILE</u> <u>OSM-FILE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Get  objects  matching  at  least  one  of the specified expressions from the input and write them to the
       output.  Expressions can either be specified on the command line or in  an  expressions  file.   See  the
       <b>FILTER</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b> section for a description of the filter expression format.

       All  objects  matching the expressions will be read from <u>OSM-FILE</u> and written to the output.  All objects
       referenced from those objects will also be added to the output unless the option <b>--omit-referenced/-R</b>  is
       used.  This applies to nodes referenced in ways and members referenced in relations.

       If  the  option  <b>--omit-referenced/-R</b> is used, the input file is read only once, otherwise the input file
       will possibly be read up to three times.

       Objects will be written out in the order they are found in the <u>OSM-FILE</u>.

       The command will only work correctly on history files if the <b>--omit-referenced/-R</b> option  is  used.   The
       command can not be used on change files.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -e FILE, --expressions=FILE
              Read  expressions  from  the  specified  file, one per line.  Empty lines are ignored.  Everything
              after the comment character (#) is also ignored.  See the <b>FILTER</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b> section  for  further
              details.

       -i, --invert-match
              Invert the sense of matching.  Exclude all objects with matching tags.

       -R, --omit-referenced
              Omit the nodes referenced from matching ways and members referenced from matching relations.

       -t, --remove-tags
              Remove  tags from objects that are not matching the filter expression but are included to complete
              references (nodes in ways and members of relations).  If an object is both matching the filter and
              used as a reference it will keep its tags.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h, --help
              Show usage help.

       -v, --verbose
              Set verbose mode.  The program will output information about what it is doing to STDERR.

       --progress
              Show progress bar.  Usually a progress bar is only displayed if STDOUT and STDERR are detected  to
              be  TTY.  With this option a progress bar is always shown.  Note that a progress bar will never be
              shown when reading from STDIN or a pipe.

       --no-progress
              Do not show progress bar.  Usually a progress bar is displayed if STDOUT and STDERR  are  detected
              to  be  a  TTY.   With  this option the progress bar is suppressed.  Note that a progress bar will
              never be shown when reading from STDIN or a pipe.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -F, --input-format=FORMAT
              The format of the input file(s).  Can be used to set the input format if it can’t be  autodetected
              from  the  file name(s).  This will set the format for all input files, there is no way to set the
              format for some input files only.  See <b><a href="../man5/osmium-file-formats.5.html">osmium-file-formats</a></b>(5) or the libosmium manual for details.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -f, --output-format=FORMAT
              The format of the output file.  Can be used  to  set  the  output  file  format  if  it  can’t  be
              autodetected  from  the  output file name.  See <b><a href="../man5/osmium-file-formats.5.html">osmium-file-formats</a></b>(5) or the libosmium manual for
              details.

       --fsync
              Call fsync after writing the output file to force flushing buffers to disk.

       --generator=NAME
              The name and version of the program generating the output file.  It will be added to the header of
              the output file.  Default is “<u>osmium/</u>” and the version of osmium.

       -o, --output=FILE
              Name of the output file.  Default is `-' (STDOUT).

       -O, --overwrite
              Allow an existing output file to be overwritten.  Normally <b>osmium</b> will refuse  to  write  over  an
              existing file.

       --output-header=OPTION=VALUE
              Add  output  header  option.   This  command  line option can be used multiple times for different
              OPTIONs.  See the <u><a href="../man5/osmium-output-headers.5.html">osmium-output-headers</a>(5)</u> man page for a list of available header  options.   For
              some  commands you can use the special format “OPTION!” (ie.  an exclamation mark after the OPTION
              and no value set) to set the value to the same as in the input file.

</pre><h4><b>FILTER</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A filter expression specifies a tag or tags that should be found in the  data  and  the  type  of  object
       (node, way, or relation) that should be matched.

       The  object  type(s) comes first, then a slash (/) and then the rest of the expression.  Object types are
       specified as `n' (for nodes), `w' (for ways), `r' (for relations), and `a' (for areas - closed ways  with
       4  or more nodes and relations with type=multipolygon or type=boundary tag).  Any combination of them can
       be used.  If the object type is not specified, the expression matches all object types.

       Some examples:

       n/amenity
              Matches all nodes with the key “amenity”.

       nw/highway
              Matches all nodes or ways with the key “highway”.

       /note  Matches objects of any type with the key “note”.

       note   Matches objects of any type with the key “note”.

       w/highway=primary
              Matches all ways with the key “highway” and value “primary”.

       w/highway!=primary
              Matches all ways with the key “highway” and a value other than “primary”.

       r/type=multipolygon,boundary
              Matches all relations with key “type” and value “multipolygon” or “boundary”.

       w/name,name:de=Kastanienallee,Kastanienstrasse
              Matches  any  way  with  a  “name”  or  “name:de”  tag  with   the   value   “Kastanienallee”   or
              “Kastanienstrasse”.

       n/addr:*
              Matches all nodes with any key starting with “addr:”

       n/name=*Paris
              Matches all nodes with a name that contains the word “Paris”.

       a/building
              Matches  any closed ways with 4 or more nodes or relations tagged “building”.  Relations must also
              have a tag “type=multipolygon” or “type=boundary”.

       If there is no equal sign (“=”) in the expression only keys are matched and values can be  anything.   If
       there  is  an  equal sign (“=”) in the expression, the key is to the left and the value to the right.  An
       exclamation sign (“!”) before the equal sign means: A tag with that key, but  not  the  value(s)  to  the
       right  of  the  equal  sign.   A  leading  or trailing asterisk (“*”) can be used for substring or prefix
       matching, respectively.  Commas (“,”) can be used to separate several keys or values.

       All filter expressions are case-sensitive.  There is no way to escape the special characters such as “=”,
       “*” and “,”.  You can not mix comma-expressions and “*”-expressions.

       The filter expressions specified in a file and/or on the command line are matched in the order  they  are
       given.  To achieve best performance, put expressions expected to match more often first.

       Area  matches (with leading “a/”) do not check whether the matched object is a valid (multi)polygon, they
       only check whether an object might possibly be turned into a (multi)polygon.  This is the  case  for  all
       closed  ways (where the first and last node are the same) with 4 or more nodes and for all relations that
       have an additional “type=multipolygon” or “type=boundary” tag.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>osmium</b> <b>tags-filter</b> exits with exit code

       0      if everything went alright,

       1      if there was an error processing the data, or

       2      if there was a problem with the command line arguments.

</pre><h4><b>MEMORY</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>osmium</b> <b>tags-filter</b> does all its work on the fly and only keeps tables of object  IDs  it  needs  in  main
       memory.  If the <b>--omit-referenced/-R</b> option is used, no IDs are kept in memory.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Get all amenity nodes from the Berlin PBF file:

              osmium tags-filter -o amenties.osm.pbf berlin.osm.pbf n/amenity

       Get all objects (nodes, ways, or relations) with a note tag:

              osmium tags-filter -R -o notes.osm.pbf berlin.osm.pbf note

       Get  all  nodes  and  ways  with  a  highway  tag and all relations tagged with type=restriction plus all
       referenced objects:

              osmium tags-filter -o filtered.osm.pbf planet.osm.pbf \
                  nw/highway r/type=restriction
