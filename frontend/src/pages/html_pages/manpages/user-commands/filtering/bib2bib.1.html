</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       BibX2bib - Filter BibTeX data bases

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bib2bib</b> <b>[options]</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> <b>...</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bib2bib</b>  is  a filter tool that reads one or several bibliography files, filters the entries with respect
       to a given criterion, and outputs the list of  selected  keys  together  with  a  new  bibliography  file
       containing  only  the  selected  entries. If no input file is given then input is taken from the standard
       input.

       Additionally, <b>bib2bib</b> may output a file containing all the keys of entries that  satisfy  the  condition.
       This second file is suitable for input as option <b>-citefile</b> to <b>bibtex2html</b>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-ob</b> <u>filename</u>
              specify  the filename where the selected entries are output. If not given, it defaults to standard
              output.

       <b>-oc</b> <u>filename</u>
              specify the filename where the list of selected keys is output. If not given,  this  file  is  not
              created.

       <b>-c</b> <u>condition</u>
              specify  a  condition  for  selecting  the  entries.  The output will retain only the entries that
              satisfy this condition. If several such condition are given, then only the  entries  that  satisfy
              all  the  conditions  are  selected.  The  syntax  of  conditions  is  described  in  the complete
              documentation, notice that it is better to escape shell expansions in that  conditions,  in  other
              words, you should write conditions between quotes.

       <b>-expand</b>
              expand  all  abbreviations in the output file. Notice that there is no way to ask for expansion of
              cross-references, since the meaning of such an expansion is unclear: it's  better  to  let  bibtex
              (via bibtex2html) handle the cross-references himself, depending on the style considered.

       <b>-s</b> <u>field</u>
              sorts  the entries of the bibliography with respect to the given field, which may be $key or $type
              to refer to the key or to the entry type, as for filter  conditions.  This  options  may  be  used
              several  times to specify a lexicographic order, such as by year, then by keys.  When the field is
              <u>$date</u> then entries are sorted chronologically.

              When sorting, the resulting  bibliography  will  always  contain  the  comments  first,  then  the
              preambles, then the abbreviations, and finally the regular entries. Be warned that such a sort may
              put cross-references before entries that refer to them, so be cautious.

       <b>-r</b>     reverses the sort

       <b>-q</b> <b>,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              be quiet.

       <b>-w</b> <b>,</b> <b>--warn-error</b>
              stop at the first warning.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>BIBTEX2HTML</b></h4><pre>
       Notice that the two output files are suitable for use with bibtex2html. A typical use would be

           bib2bib -oc citefile -ob bibfile.bib -c condition file1.bib file2.bib ...
           bibtex2html -citefile citefile bibfile.bib

       which  will  produce  exactly  the HTML file for the selected references. Notice finally that bibtex2html
       will expand the strings (by default, unless  you  specify  the  -noexpand  option)  but  not  the  cross-
       references.
