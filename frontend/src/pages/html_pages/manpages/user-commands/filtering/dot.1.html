</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These  are  a  collection  of  programs for drawing graphs.  There is actually only one main program; the
       specific layout algorithms are implemented as plugins. Thus, they largely share all of the same  command-
       line options.

       <u>dot</u>  draws  directed graphs.  It works well on directed acyclic graphs and other graphs that can be drawn
       as hierarchies or have a natural ``flow.''

       <u>neato</u> draws undirected graphs using a ``spring'' model and reducing the related energy  (see  Kamada  and
       Kawai, Information Processing Letters 31:1, April 1989).

       <u>twopi</u>  draws  graphs  using  a  radial layout (see G. Wills, Symposium on Graph Drawing GD'97, September,
       1997).  Basically, one node is chosen as the center and put at  the  origin.   The  remaining  nodes  are
       placed  on  a sequence of concentric circles centered about the origin, each a fixed radial distance from
       the previous circle.  All nodes distance 1 from the center are placed on  the  first  circle;  all  nodes
       distance 1 from a node on the first circle are placed on the second circle; and so forth.

       <u>circo</u>  draws  graphs using a circular layout (see Six and Tollis, GD '99 and ALENEX '99, and Kaufmann and
       Wiese, GD '02.)  The tool identifies biconnected components and draws the nodes of  the  component  on  a
       circle.  The  block‐cutpoint  tree  is  then  laid out using a recursive radial algorithm. Edge crossings
       within a circle are minimized by placing as many  edges  on  the  circle's  perimeter  as  possible.   In
       particular,  if the component is outerplanar, the component will have a planar layout.  If a node belongs
       to multiple non‐trivial biconnected components, the layout puts the node in one of them. By default, this
       is the first non‐trivial component found in the search from the root component.

       <u>fdp</u> draws undirected graphs using a ``spring'' model. It relies  on  a  force‐directed  approach  in  the
       spirit of Fruchterman and Reingold (cf. Software‐Practice &amp; Experience <a href="../man11/21.11.html">21</a>(11), 1991, pp. 1129‐1164).

       <u>sfdp</u>  also  draws undirected graphs using the ``spring'' model described above, but it uses a multi-scale
       approach to produce layouts of large graphs in a reasonably short time.

       <u>patchwork</u> draws the graph as a squarified treemap (see M. Bruls et al.,  ``Squarified  treemaps'',  Proc.
       Joint  Eurographics and IEEE TCVG Symp. on Visualization, 2000, pp. 33-42). The clusters of the graph are
       used to specify the tree.

       <u>osage</u> draws the graph using its cluster structure. For a given cluster, each of its subclusters  is  laid
       out  internally.  Then the subclusters, plus any remaining nodes, are repositioned based on the cluster's
       <b>pack</b> and <b>packmode</b> attributes.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       Graphviz uses an extensible plugin mechanism for its output renderers, so to see what output formats your
       installation of dot supports you can use ``dot -T:'' and check the warning  message.   Also,  The  plugin
       mechanism  supports  multiple implementations of the output formats, allowing variations in the renderers
       and formatters.  To see what variants are available for a particular output  format,  use,  for  example:
       ``dot -Tpng:'' and to force a particular variant, use, for example: ``dot -Tpng:gd''

       Traditionally, Graphviz supports the following:
       <b>-Tdot</b> (Dot format containing layout information),
       <b>-Txdot</b> (Dot format containing complete layout information),
       <b>-Tps</b> (PostScript),
       <b>-Tpdf</b> (PDF),
       <b>-Tsvg</b> <b>-Tsvgz</b> (Structured Vector Graphics),
       <b>-Tfig</b> (XFIG graphics),
       <b>-Tpng</b> (png bitmap graphics),
       <b>-Tgif</b> (gif bitmap graphics),
       <b>-Tjpg</b> <b>-Tjpeg</b> (jpeg bitmap graphics),
       <b>-Tjson</b> (xdot information encoded in JSON),
       <b>-Timap</b> (imagemap files for httpd servers for each node or edge that has a non‐null <b>href</b> attribute.),
       <b>-Tcmapx</b> (client‐side imagemap for use in html and xhtml).
       Additional    less    common    or    more    special‐purpose    output   formats   can   be   found   at
       //<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/content/output-formats">http://www.graphviz.org/content/output-formats</a>.

       Alternative plugins providing support for a given output format can  be  found  from  the  error  message
       resulting from appending a ':' to the format. e.g. <b>-Tpng:</b> The first plugin listed is always the default.

       The  <b>-P</b>  switch  can  be used to produce a graph of all output variants supported by plugins in the local
       installation of graphviz.

</pre><h4><b>GRAPH</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>LANGUAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Here is a synopsis of the graph file language, normally using the extension <b>.gv</b>, for graphs:

       [<b>strict</b>] (<b>graph</b>|<b>digraph</b>) <u>name</u> { <u>statement‐list</u> }
       is the top‐level graph. If the graph is <b>strict</b>, then multiple edges are  not  allowed  between  the  same
       pairs  of nodes.  If it is a directed graph, indicated by <b>digraph</b>, then the <u>edgeop</u> must be "-&gt;". If it is
       an undirected <b>graph</b> then the <u>edgeop</u> must be "--".

       Statements may be:

       <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>val</u><b>;</b>
       <b>node</b> <b>[</b><u>name</u><b>=</b><u>val</u><b>];</b>
       <b>edge</b> <b>[</b><u>name</u><b>=</b><u>val</u><b>];</b>
       Set default graph, node, or edge attribute <u>name</u> to <u>val</u>.  Any subgraph, node, or edge appearing after this
       inherits the new default attributes.

       <b>n0</b> <b>[</b><u>name0=val0,name1=val1,...</u><b>];</b>
       Creates node <b>n0</b> (if it does not already exist) and sets its attributes according to the optional list.

       <b>n0</b> <u>edgeop</u> n1 <u>edgeop</u> <u>...</u> <u>edgeop</u> nn <b>[</b><u>name0=val0,name1=val1,...</u><b>];</b>
       Creates edges between nodes <b>n0</b>, <b>n1</b>, ..., <b>nn</b> and sets their attributes according  to  the  optional  list.
       Creates nodes as necessary.

       [<b>subgraph</b> <u>name</u>] <b>{</b> <u>statement‐list</u> <b>}</b>
       Creates  a  subgraph.   Subgraphs  may  be used in place of <b>n0</b>, ..., <b>nn</b> in the above statements to create
       edges.  [<b>subgraph</b> <u>name</u>] is optional; if missing, the subgraph is assigned an internal name.

       The language accepts both C‐style comments /*C...*/ or //...

       Attribute names and values are ordinary (C‐style) strings.  The following  sections  describe  attributes
       that control graph layout.

       A more complete description of the language can be found at <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/content/dot-language">http://www.graphviz.org/content/dot-language</a>.

</pre><h4><b>GRAPH,</b> <b>NODE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>EDGE</b> <b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       Graphviz  uses  the  <u>name</u>=<u>value</u> attributes, attached to graphs, subgraphs, nodes and edges, to tailor the
       layout and rendering. We list the more prominent attributes below. The  complete  list  is  available  at
       <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/content/attrs">http://www.graphviz.org/content/attrs</a>.

</pre><h4><b>Attributes</b> <b>Common</b> <b>to</b> <b>Nodes,</b> <b>Edges,</b> <b>Clusters</b> <b>and</b> <b>Graphs</b></h4><pre>
       <b>href=</b><u>url</u> the default url for image map files; in PostScript files, the base URL for all relative URLs, as
       recognized by Acrobat Distiller 3.0 and up.

       <b>URL=</b><u>url</u> (``URL'' is a synonym for ``href.'')

       <b>fontcolor=</b><u>colorvalue</u> sets the label text color.

       A  <u>colorvalue</u>  may be "<u>h,s,v</u><b>"</b> (hue, saturation, brightness) floating point numbers between 0 and 1, or an
       X11 color name such as <b>white,</b> <b>black,</b> <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>blue,</b> <b>yellow,</b> <b>magenta,</b> or <b>cyan</b>,  or  a  "<u>#rrggbb"</u>  <u>(red,</u>
       <u>green,</u>  <u>blue,</u>  <u>2</u>  <u>hex</u>  <u>characters</u>  <u>each)</u>  <u>value.</u>   <u>See</u>  <u><a href="http://www.graphviz.org/content/attrs">http://www.graphviz.org/content/attrs</a>#kcolor</u>  <u>and</u>
       <u><a href="http://www.graphviz.org/content/color-names">http://www.graphviz.org/content/color-names</a></u> <u>for</u> <u>further</u> <u>details.</u>

       <b>fontsize=</b><u>n</u> sets the label type size to <u>n</u> points.

       <b>fontname=</b><u>name</u> sets the label font family name.

       <b>label=</b><u>text</u> where <u>text</u> may include escaped newlines \n, \l, or \r for center, left,  and  right  justified
       lines.  The string '\G' value will be replaced by the graph name.  For node labels, the string '\N' value
       will  be  replaced  by  the  node name.  For edges, if the substring '\T' is found in a label, it will be
       replaced by the name of the tail node; if the substring '\H' is found in a label, it will be replaced  by
       the  name  of  the  head  node;  if  the substring '\E' value is found in a label it will be replaced by:
       <u>tail_node_name</u>-&gt;<u>head_node_name</u> or by: <u>tail_node_name</u>--<u>head_node_name</u> for undirected graphs.

       Graphviz also supports special HTML-like labels for constructing complex node content. A full‐description
       of these is given at <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/content/node-shapes">http://www.graphviz.org/content/node-shapes</a>#html.

       If a node has <b>shape=record</b>, the label may  contain  recursive  box  lists  delimited  by  {  |  }.   Port
       identifiers in labels are set off by angle brackets &lt; &gt;.

</pre><h4><b>Graph</b> <b>Attributes</b></h4><pre>
       <b>size="</b><u>x,y</u><b>"</b> specifies the maximum bounding box of drawing in inches.

       <b>ratio=</b><u>f</u>  sets  the  aspect  ratio to <u>f</u> which may be a floating point number, or one of the keywords <b>fill</b>,
       <b>compress</b>, or <b>auto</b>.

       <b>layout=</b><u>engine</u> indicates the preferred layout engine (<b>dot</b>, <b>neato</b>, <b>fdp</b>, etc.) overriding the  default  from
       the basename of the command or the -K commandline option.

       <b>margin=</b><u>f</u> sets the page margin (included in the page size).

       <b>ordering=out</b> constrains order of out‐edges in a subgraph according to their file sequence.

       <b>rotate=90</b> sets landscape mode.  (<b>orientation=land</b> is backward compatible but obsolete.)

       <b>center=</b><u>n</u> a non‐zero value centers the drawing on the page.

       <b>color=</b><u>colorvalue</u> sets foreground color (<b>bgcolor</b> for background).

       <b>overlap=</b><u>mode</u>. This specifies what algorithm should do if any nodes overlap. If mode is <b>false</b>, the program
       uses  the  Prism  algorithm  to  adjust  the nodes to eliminate overlaps. If mode is <b>scale</b>, the layout is
       uniformly scaled up, preserving node sizes, until nodes no longer overlap. The latter  technique  removes
       overlaps  while  preserving  symmetry and structure, while the former removes overlaps more compactly but
       destroys symmetries.  If mode is <b>true</b> (the default), no repositioning is done.  Since the  <b>dot</b>  algorithm
       always produces a layout with no node overlaps, this attribute is only useful with other layouts.

       <b>stylesheet=</b><u>"file.css"</u> includes a reference to a stylesheet in -Tsvg and -Tsvgz outputs.  Ignored by other
       formats.

       <b>splines</b>  If  set  to <b>true</b>, edges are drawn as splines.  If set to <b>polyline</b>, edges are drawn as polylines.
       If set to <b>ortho</b>, edges are drawn as orthogonal polylines.  In all of these  cases,  the  nodes  must  not
       overlap.   If  <b>splines=false</b>  or <b>splines=line</b>, edges are drawn as line segments.  The default is <b>true</b> for
       dot, and <b>false</b> for all other layouts.

       <b>(dot‐specific</b> <b>attributes)</b>

       <b>nodesep=</b><u>f</u> sets the minimum separation between nodes.

       <b>ranksep=</b><u>f</u> sets the minimum separation between ranks.

       <b>rankdir=LR|RL|BT</b> requests a left‐to‐right, right‐to‐left, or bottom‐to‐top, drawing.

       <b>rank=same</b> (or <b>min</b> or <b>max</b>) in a subgraph constrains the rank assignment of its nodes.    If  a  subgraph's
       name  has the prefix <b>cluster</b>, its nodes are drawn in a distinct rectangle of the layout.  Clusters may be
       nested.

       <b>(neato‐specific</b> <b>attributes)</b>
       <b>mode=</b><u>val</u>.  Algorithm for minimizing energy in the layout. By default, <b>neato</b> uses stress majorization.  If
       <b>mode=KK</b>, it uses a version of gradient descent.

       <b>model=</b><u>val</u>.   The <b>neato</b> model computes the desired distances between all pairs of vertices. By default, it
       uses the length of the shortest path. If <b>model</b> is set to <b>circuit</b>, a circuit-resistance model is used.  If
       <b>model</b> is set to <b>subset</b>, it uses a model whereby the edge length is the number of nodes that are neighbors
       of exactly one of the edge's vertices.

       <b>start=</b><u>val</u>.  Requests random initial placement and seeds the random number generator.  If <u>val</u>  is  not  an
       integer, the process ID or current time is used as the seed.

       <b>epsilon=</b><u>n</u>.  Sets the cutoff for the solver.  The default is 0.1.

       <b>(twopi‐specific</b> <b>attributes)</b>
       <b>root=</b><u>ctr</u>.  This  specifies  the node to be used as the center of the layout. If not specified, <u>twopi</u> will
       randomly pick one of the nodes that are furthest from a leaf node, where a leaf node is a node of  degree
       1. If no leaf nodes exists, an arbitrary node is picked as center.

       <b>ranksep=</b><u>val</u>. Specifies the radial distance in inches between the sequence of rings. The default is 0.75.

       <b>(circo‐specific</b> <b>attributes)</b>
       <b>root=</b><u>nodename</u>.  Specifies  the  name of a node occurring in the root block. If the graph is disconnected,
       the <b>root</b> node attribute can be used to specify additional root blocks.

       <b>mindist=</b><u>value</u>. Sets the minimum separation between all nodes. If not specified then <u>circo</u> uses a  default
       value of 1.0.

       <b>(fdp‐specific</b> <b>attributes)</b>
       <b>K=</b><u>val</u>. Sets the default ideal node separation in the layout.

       <b>maxiter=</b><u>val</u>. Sets the maximum number of iterations used to layout the graph.

       <b>start=</b><u>val</u>.  Adjusts  the  random  initial placement of nodes with no specified position.  If <u>val</u> is is an
       integer, it is used as the seed for the random number generator.  If <u>val</u> is  not  an  integer,  a  random
       system‐generated integer, such as the process ID or current time, is used as the seed.

</pre><h4><b>Node</b> <b>Attributes</b></h4><pre>
       <b>height=</b><u>d</u>  or  <b>width=</b><u>d</u>  sets minimum height or width.  Adding <b>fixedsize=true</b> forces these to be the actual
       size (text labels are ignored).

       <b>shape=</b><u>builtin_polygon</u> record epsf
       <u>builtin_polygon</u> can be such values as <b>plaintext,</b> <b>ellipse,</b> <b>oval,</b>  <b>circle,</b>  <b>egg,</b>  <b>triangle,</b>  <b>box,</b>  <b>diamond,</b>
       <b>trapezium,</b>  <b>parallelogram,</b>  <b>house,</b>  <b>hexagon,</b>  <b>octagon,</b>  <b>note,</b>  <b>tab,</b>  <b>box3d,</b>  <b>or</b> <b>component,</b>, among others.
       (Polygons are defined or  modified  by  the  following  node  attributes:  <b>regular</b>,  <b>peripheries</b>,  <b>sides</b>,
       <b>orientation</b>,  <b>distortion</b>  and  <b>skew</b>.)   <b>epsf</b>  uses  the node's <b>shapefile</b> attribute as the path name of an
       external EPSF file to be automatically loaded for the node shape.

       See <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/content/node-shapes">http://www.graphviz.org/content/node-shapes</a> for a complete description of node shapes.

       <b>color=</b><u>colorvalue</u> sets the outline color, and the default fill color if style=filled and <b>fillcolor</b> is  not
       specified.

       <b>fillcolor=</b><u>colorvalue</u>  sets  the  fill  color  when  style=filled.   If  not specified, the fillcolor when
       style=filled defaults to be the same as the outline color.

       <b>style=filled</b> <b>solid</b> <b>dashed</b> <b>dotted</b> <b>bold</b> <b>invis</b>

       <b>xlabel=</b><u>"text"</u> specifies a label that will be place near, but outside, of a node. The normal <b>label</b>  string
       is placed within the node shape.

       <b>target=</b><u>"target"</u>  is  a  target string for client‐side imagemaps and SVG, effective when nodes have a URL.
       The target string is used to determine which window of the browser is used for the URL.   Setting  it  to
       "_graphviz"  will  open  a new window if it doesn't already exist, or reuse it if it does.  If the target
       string is empty, the default, then no target attribute is included in the output.   The  substrings  '\N'
       and  '\G' are substituted in the same manner as for the node label attribute.  Additionally the substring
       '\L' is substituted with the node label string.

       <b>tooltip=</b><u>"text"</u> is a tooltip string for client‐side imagemaps and SVG, effective when nodes  have  a  URL.
       The  tooltip string defaults to be the same as the label string, but this attribute permits nodes without
       labels to still have  tooltips  thus  permitting  denser  graphs.   The  substrings  '\N'  and  '\G'  are
       substituted  in  the  same  manner  as  for the node label attribute.  Additionally the substring '\L' is
       substituted with the node label string.

       The following attributes apply only to polygon shape nodes:

       <b>regular=</b><u>n</u> if <u>n</u> is non‐zero then the polygon is made regular, i.e. symmetric  about  the  x  and  y  axis,
       otherwise  the  polygon  takes  on  the aspect ratio of the label.  <u>builtin_polygons</u> that are not already
       regular are made regular by this attribute.  <u>builtin_polygons</u> that are already regular are  not  affected
       (i.e.  they cannot be made asymmetric).

       <b>peripheries=</b><u>n</u>  sets  the  number  of periphery lines drawn around the polygon.  This value supersedes the
       number of periphery lines of <u>builtin_polygons</u>.

       <b>sides=</b><u>n</u> sets the number of sides to the polygon. <u>n</u>&lt;3 results in an ellipse.  This attribute is ignored by
       <u>builtin_polygons</u>.

       <b>orientation=</b><u>f</u> sets the orientation of the first apex of the polygon counterclockwise from  the  vertical,
       in  degrees.   <u>f</u>  may  be  a  floating  point  number.  The orientation of labels is not affected by this
       attribute.  This attribute is added to the initial orientation of <u>builtin_polygons.</u>

       <b>distortion=</b><u>f</u> sets the amount of broadening of the  top  and  narrowing  of  the  bottom  of  the  polygon
       (relative to its orientation).  Floating point values between -1 and +1 are suggested.  This attribute is
       ignored by <u>builtin_polygons</u>.

       <b>skew=</b><u>f</u>  sets  the  amount  of  right‐displacement  of  the top and left‐displacement of the bottom of the
       polygon (relative to its orientation).  Floating point values between -1  and  +1  are  suggested.   This
       attribute is ignored by <u>builtin_polygons</u>.

       <b>(circo‐specific</b> <b>attributes)</b>
       <b>root=</b><u>true/false</u>.  This  specifies  that the block containing the given node be treated as the root of the
       spanning tree in the layout.

       <b>(neato‐</b> <b>and</b> <b>fdp‐specific</b> <b>attributes)</b>
       <b>pin=</b><u>val</u>. If <u>val</u> is <b>true</b>, the node will remain at its initial position.

</pre><h4><b>Edge</b> <b>Attributes</b></h4><pre>
       <b>weight=</b><u>val</u> where <u>val</u> is the cost of the edge.  For <b>dot</b>, weights must be  non-negative  integers.   Values
       greater  than 1 tend to shorten the edge;  weight 0 flat edges are ignored for ordering nodes.  In <b>twopi</b>,
       a weight of 0 will cause the edge to be ignored in constructing the underlying spanning tree.  For  <b>neato</b>
       and <b>fdp</b>, a heavier weight will put more emphasis on the algorithm achieving an edge length closer to that
       specified by the edge's <b>len</b> attribute.

       <b>style=solid</b> <b>dashed</b> <b>dotted</b> <b>bold</b> <b>invis</b>

       <b>color=</b><u>colorvalue</u> sets the line color for edges.

       <b>color=</b><u>colorvaluelist</u> a ':' separated list of <u>colorvalue</u> creates parallel edges, one edge for each color.

       <b>dir=forward</b> <b>back</b> <b>both</b> <b>none</b> controls arrow direction.

       <b>tailclip,headclip=false</b> disables endpoint shape clipping.

       <b>target=</b><u>"text"</u>  is a target string for client‐side imagemaps and SVG, effective when edges have a URL.  If
       the target string is empty, the default, then no  target  attribute  is  included  in  the  output.   The
       substrings  '\T', '\H', '\E' and '\G' are substituted in the same manner as for the edge label attribute.
       Additionally the substring '\L' is substituted with the edge label string.

       <b>tooltip=</b><u>"text"</u> is a tooltip string for client‐side imagemaps  effective  when  edges  have  a  URL.   The
       tooltip  string  defaults  to  be the same as the edge label string.  The substrings '\T', '\H', '\E' and
       '\G' are substituted in the same manner as for the edge label attribute.  Additionally the substring '\L'

       the head or tail node, respectively.  Note  that  this  only  specifies  the  shape.  The  <b>dir</b>  attribute
       determines whether or not the glyph is drawn.

       <b>headlabel,taillabel=</b><u>text</u> for labels appearing near the head and tail nodes of an  edge.   <b>labelfontcolor</b>,
       <b>labelfontname</b>,  <b>labelfontsize</b>  for  head  and  tail labels.  The substrings '\T', '\H', '\E' and '\G' are
       substituted in the same manner as for the edge label  attribute.   Additionally  the  substring  '\L'  is
       substituted with the edge label string.

       <b>headhref=</b><u>"url"</u>  sets  the  url  for  the head port in imagemap, PostScript and SVG files.  The substrings
       '\T', '\H', '\E' and '\G'  are  substituted  in  the  same  manner  as  for  the  edge  label  attribute.
       Additionally the substring '\L' is substituted with the edge label string.

       <b>headURL=</b><u>"url"</u> (<b>headURL</b> is a synonym for <b>headhref</b>.)

       <b>headtarget=</b><u>"headtarget"</u>  is  a target string for client‐side imagemaps and SVG, effective when edge heads
       have a URL.  The headtarget string is used to determine which window of the browser is used for the  URL.
       If  the headtarget string is empty, the default, then headtarget defaults to the same value as target for
       the edge.  The substrings '\T', '\H', '\E' and '\G' are substituted in the same manner as  for  the  edge
       label attribute.  Additionally the substring '\L' is substituted with the edge label string.

       <b>headtooltip=</b><u>"tooltip"</u> is a tooltip string for client‐side imagemaps effective when head ports have a URL.
       The  tooltip string defaults to be the same as the headlabel string.  The substrings '\T', '\H', and '\E'
       are substituted in the same manner as for the edge label attribute.  Additionally the substring  '\L'  is
       substituted with the edge label string.

       <b>tailhref=</b><u>"url"</u>  sets  the  url  for  the tail port in imagemap, PostScript and SVG files.  The substrings
       '\T', '\H', '\E' and '\G'  are  substituted  in  the  same  manner  as  for  the  edge  label  attribute.

       '\G' are substituted in the same manner as for the edge label attribute.  Additionally the substring '\L'
       is substituted with the edge label string.

       <b>labeldistance</b> and <b>labelangle</b> (in degrees CCW) specify the placement of head and tail labels.

       <b>decorate</b> draws line from edge to label.

       <b>samehead,sametail</b> aim edges having the same value to the same port, using the average landing point.

       <b>(dot‐specific</b> <b>attributes)</b>
       <b>constraint=false</b> causes an edge to be ignored for rank assignment.

       <b>minlen=</b><u>n</u> where <u>n</u> is an integer factor that applies to the edge length (ranks for normal edges, or minimum
       node separation for flat edges).

       <b>xlabel=</b><u>"text"</u> Edge labels in <b>dot</b> are treated as special types of nodes, with  space  allocated  for  them
       during  node  layout. This can sometimes deform the edge routing. If an <b>xlabel</b> is used instead, the label
       is placed after all nodes and edges have been positioned. In turn, this  may  mean  that  there  is  some
       overlap among the labels.

       <b>(neato</b> <b>and</b> <b>fdp‐specific</b> <b>attributes)</b>
       <b>len=</b><u>f</u> sets the optimal length of an edge.  The default is 1.0.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND‐LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-G</b> sets a default graph attribute.
       <b>-N</b> sets a default node attribute.
       <b>-E</b> sets a default edge attribute.  Example: <b>-Gsize="7,8"</b> <b>-Nshape=box</b> <b>-Efontsize=8</b>

       <b>-l</b><u>file</u>  loads  custom  PostScript library files.  Usually these define custom shapes or styles.  If <b>-l</b> is
       given by itself, the standard library is omitted.

       <b>-T</b><u>lang</u> sets the output language as described above.

       <b>-n</b>[<b>1</b>|<b>2</b>] (no‐op) If set, neato assumes nodes have already  been  positioned  and  all  nodes  have  a  pos
       attribute  giving  the  positions.   It then performs an optional adjustment to remove node‐node overlap,
       depending on the value of the overlap attribute, computes the edge layouts, depending on the value of the
       <b>splines</b> attribute, and emits the graph in the appropriate format.  If  num  is  supplied,  the  following
       actions occur:
           num = 1
       Equivalent to -n.
           num &gt; 1
       Use  node  positions  as  specified,  with  no  adjustment to remove node‐node overlaps, and use any edge
       layouts already specified by the pos attribute.  neato computes an edge layout for any edge that does not
       have a <b>pos</b> attribute.  As usual, edge layout is guided by the <b>splines</b> attribute.

       <b>-K</b><u>layout</u> override the default layout engine implied by the command name.

       <b>-O</b> automatically generate output filenames based on the input filename and the -T format.

       <b>-P</b> generate a graph of the currently available plugins.

       <b>-v</b> (verbose) prints various information useful for debugging.

       <b>-c</b> configure plugins.

       <b>-m</b> memory test (observe no growth with top, kill when done).

       <b>-q</b><u>level</u> set level of message suppression. The default is 1.

       <b>-s</b><u>fscale</u> scale input by <u>fscale</u>, the default is 72.

       <b>-y</b> invert y coordinate in output.

       <b>-V</b> (version) prints version information and exits.

       <b>-?</b> prints the usage and exits.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Edge splines can overlap unintentionally.

       Flat edge labels are slightly broken.  Intercluster edge labels are totally broken.

       Because unconstrained optimization is employed, node boxes can possibly overlap or touch unrelated edges.
       All existing spring embedders seem to have this limitation.

       Apparently reasonable attempts to pin nodes or adjust edge lengths and weights can cause instability.
