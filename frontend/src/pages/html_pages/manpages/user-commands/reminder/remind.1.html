</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       remind - a sophisticated reminder service

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>remind</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u>] <u>filename</u> [<u>date</u>] [<u>*rep</u>] [<u>time</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Remind</b> reads the supplied <u>filename</u> and executes the commands found in it.  The commands are used to issue
       reminders  and  alarms.   Each  reminder  or alarm can consist of a message sent to standard output, or a
       program to be executed.

       If <u>filename</u> is specified as a single dash '-', then <b>Remind</b> takes its input from standard input.

       If <u>filename</u> happens to be a directory rather than a plain file, then <b>Remind</b> reads all of the  files  (but
       not any subdirectories!)  in that directory that match the pattern "*.rem".  The files are read in sorted
       order;  the  sort  order  may depend on your locale, but should match the sort order used by the shell to
       expand "*.rem".

       <b>Remind</b> reads its files starting from the beginning to the end, or until it encounters a line  whose  sole
       content is "__EOF__" (without the quotes.)  Anything after the __EOF__ marker is completely ignored.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Remind</b>  has a slew of options.  If you're new to the program, ignore them for now and skip to the section
       "REMINDER FILES".

       <b>-n</b>     The <b>-n</b> option causes <b>Remind</b> to print the <b>next</b> occurrence of each reminder  in  a  simple  calendar
              format.   You can sort this by date by piping the output through <b><a href="../man1/sort.1.html">sort</a>(1)</b>.  Note that the <b>-n</b> option
              causes any <b>-g</b> option to be <u>ignored</u> and also implicitly enables the <b>-o</b> option.

       <b>-j</b>[<u>n</u>]  Runs <b>Remind</b> in "purge" mode to get rid of expired reminders.   See  the  section  PURGE  MODE  for
              details.

       <b>-r</b>     The <b>-r</b> option disables <b>RUN</b> directives and the <b>shell()</b> function.

       <b>-c</b><u>[flags]n</u>
              The  <b>-c</b> option causes <b>Remind</b> to produce a calendar that is sent to standard output.  If you supply
              a number <u>n</u>, then a calendar will be generated for <u>n</u> months, starting with the current  month.   By
              default, a calendar for only the current month is produced.  This option implicitly enables the <b>-o</b>
              option.

              You can precede <u>n</u> (if any) with a set of flags.  The flags are as follows:

              <b>'+'</b>    causes a calendar for <u>n</u> weeks to be produced.

              <b>'a'</b>    causes  <b>Remind</b>  to display reminders on the calendar on the day they actually occur <u>as</u> <u>well</u>
                     <u>as</u> on any preceding days specified by the reminder's <u>delta</u>.  This  <u>also</u>  causes  <b>Remind</b>  to
                     include  text  outside %"...%" sequences that would otherwise be removed (though the actual
                     %" markers themselves are removed.)

              <b>'l'</b>    causes <b>Remind</b> to use VT100 line-drawing characters to draw the  calendar.   The  characters
                     are hard-coded and will only work on terminals that emulate the VT00 line-drawing character
                     set.

              <b>'u'</b>    is  similar  to  'l',  but causes <b>Remind</b> to use UNICODE line-drawing characters to draw the
                     calendar.  The characters are hard-coded and will only work on terminals that  are  set  to
                     UTF-8  character  encoding.   This flag also enables the use of the UNICODE "left-to-right"
                     mark that can fix up formatting problems  with  right-to-left  languages  in  the  calendar
                     display.

              <b>'c'</b>    causes  <b>Remind</b>  to use VT100 escape sequences to approximate SPECIAL COLOR reminders.  Note
                     that this flag is kept  for  backwards-compatibility;  you  should  use  the  <b>-@</b><u>[n][,m][,b]</u>
                     command-line option instead.

       <b>-@</b>[<u>n</u>][,<u>m</u>][,<u>b</u>]
              Tells  <b>Remind</b>  to approximate SPECIAL COLOR and SHADE reminders using VT100 escape sequences.  The
              approximation is (of necessity) very coarse, because the VT100  only  has  eight  different  color
              sequences,  each  with  one  of two brightnesses.  A color component greater than 64 is considered
              "on", and if any of the three color components is  greater  than  128,  the  color  is  considered
              "bright".

              If  you supply the optional numeric parameters, the have the following meanings:  <u>n</u>=0 tells <b>Remind</b>
              to use the standard 16 VT100 colors.  <u>n</u>=1 tells it to use an extended 256-color palette  supported
              by  many  terminal emulators such as xterm.  And <u>n</u>=2 tells it to use escape sequences that support
              true 24-bit colors, again supported by many terminal emulators such as xterm.

              If the optional <u>m</u> parameter is supplied following a comma, then <u>m</u>=0 tells <b>Remind</b> that the terminal
              background is dark, and <b>Remind</b> will brighten up dark colors to make them visible.   If  <u>m</u>=1,  then
              <b>Remind</b>  assumes  the  terminal  background  is light and it will darken bright colors to make them
              visible.  If <u>m</u> is specified as 2, then <b>Remind</b> does not perform any adjustments, and some reminders
              may be hard or impossible to see if the color is too close to the terminal background  color.   If
              you  supply  the letter <b>t</b> rather than a number, then Remind attempts to guess the background color
              of the terminal, <u>even</u> <u>if</u> stdout is not a terminal.

              On startup, if the standard output is a terminal, <b>Remind</b> attempts to  determine  if  the  terminal
              background  is  dark  or  light  by  sending a special escape sequence to determine the background
              color.  The <u>m</u> parameter can override this check (or force it if <u>m</u> is given as <b>t</b>.)

              If the optional <u>b</u> parameter is supplied following a comma, then <u>b=0</u> tells <b>Remind</b> to ignore SPECIAL
              SHADE reminders (the default) and <u>b=1</u> tells <b>Remind</b> to respect SPECIAL SHADE reminders by  emitting
              VT100  escape  codes  to color the background of the calendar cell.  Note that SHADE does not work
              well unless you are using the extended 256-color palette (<u>n</u>=1) or the true  24-bit  colors  (<u>n</u>=2).
              Note  that for calendar cells that are shaded, the clamping mechanism described earlier for <u>m=0</u> or
              <u>m=1</u> is skipped; it is assumed that if you set <u>both</u> the foreground color  of  a  reminder  and  the
              background color of a cell, then you know what you are doing.

       <b>-w</b><u>col</u>[,<u>pad</u>[,<u>spc</u>]]]
              The  <b>-w</b>  option  specifies the output width, padding and spacing of the formatted calendar output.
              <u>Col</u> specifies the number of columns in the  output  device.   If  <u>col</u>  is  not  specified,  or  is
              specified  as 0, it defaults to the larger of 71 or the actual width of your terminal, or to 80 if
              standard output is not a terminal.  If <u>col</u> is specified as the letter <b>t</b>, then <b>Remind</b>  attempts  to
              get  the width of the <b>/dev/tty</b> terminal device.  This is useful, for example, if you pipe calendar
              output into <b>less</b>; even though standard output is a  pipe,  you  want  the  calendar  to  be  sized
              correctly for your terminal window:

                      remind -c -wt .reminders | less

              Note  that  the  value  of  <u>col</u>  is  also  used  to  set  the system variable $FormWidth, which is
              initialized to <u>col</u> - 8.  See "SYSTEM VARIABLES" for details.

              <u>Pad</u> specifies how many lines to use to "pad" empty calendar boxes.  This defaults to  5.   If  you
              have  many  reminders  on certain days that make your calendar too large to fit on a page, you can
              try reducing <u>pad</u> to make the empty boxes smaller.  <u>Spc</u> specifies how many  blank  lines  to  leave
              between the day number and the first reminder entry.  It defaults to 1.

              Any  of <u>col</u>, <u>pad</u> or <u>spc</u> can be omitted, providing you provide the correct number of commas.  Don't
              use any spaces in the option.

       <b>-s</b>[<b>a</b>]<u>n</u> The <b>-s</b> option is very similar to the <b>-c</b> option, except that the output calendar is not  formatted.
              It  is  listed  in  a  "simple  format" that can be used as input for more sophisticated calendar-
              drawing programs.  If <u>n</u> starts with "+", then it is interpreted as a number of weeks.  This option
              also implicitly enables the <b>-o</b> option.

              If you immediately follow the <b>s</b> with the letter <b>a</b>, then <b>Remind</b> displays reminders on the  calendar
              on the day they actually occur <u>as</u> <u>well</u> <u>as</u> on any preceding days specified by the reminder's <u>delta</u>.

       <b>-p</b>[<b>a</b>][<b>p</b>][<b>p</b>][<b>q</b>][+]<u>n</u>
              The  <b>-p</b>  option  is  very  similar  to  the  <b>-s</b> option, except that the output contains additional
              information for use by a back-end such as the <b>Rem2PS</b> program, which creates a PostScript calendar,
              and various other back-end programs.  If <u>n</u> starts with "+", then it specifies a  number  of  weeks
              rather than a number of months, and back-ends are expected to produce weekly calendars.  Note that
              not all back-ends support weekly calendars; currently, only <b>rem2pdf</b> and <b>rem2html</b> do.  Specifying a
              weekly calendar implicitly enables the pure JSON interchange format, similar to <b>-ppp</b>.

              The format of the <b>-p</b> output is described in the <b><a href="../man1/rem2ps.1.html">rem2ps</a>(1)</b> man page.  If you immediately follow the
              <b>p</b> with the letter <b>a</b>, then <b>Remind</b> displays reminders on the calendar on the day they actually occur
              <u>as</u>  <u>well</u>  <u>as</u>  on  any  preceding days specified by the reminder's <u>delta</u>.  If you follow the <b>p</b> with
              another <b>p</b>, then <b>Remind</b> uses a  more  comprehensive  JSON-based  format  rather  than  the  "simple
              calendar"  format.  This format is also documented in the <b><a href="../man1/rem2ps.1.html">rem2ps</a>(1)</b> man page.  Finally, if you use
              three p's, as in <b>-ppp</b>, then <b>Remind</b> uses a pure JSON format, again documented in <b><a href="../man1/rem2ps.1.html">rem2ps</a>(1)</b>.  If you
              include a <b>q</b> letter with this option, then the normal calendar-mode substitution filter is disabled
              and the %"...%" sequences are preserved in the output.

              Note that to pass INFO strings to a back-end, you must use <b>-pp</b> or <b>-ppp</b>.  The simpler <b>-p</b> format  is
              not capable of transmitting the INFO strings to the back-end.

              The <b>-p</b>, <b>-pp</b> and <b>-ppp</b> options implicitly enable the <b>-o</b> option.

              Note that the <b>-pp</b> or <b>-ppp</b> options also enable the <b>-l</b> option.

       <b>-l</b>     If  you  use  the  -l  option  in  conjunction  with the -p option, then <b>Remind</b> outputs additional
              information for back-end programs such as <b>rem2ps</b>.  This additional information lets  the  back-end
              programs correlate a reminder with the source file and line number that produced it.

       <b>-m</b>     The  <b>-m</b>  option  causes  the  <b>-c</b>  or <b>-p</b> options to produce a calendar whose first column is Monday
              rather than Sunday.  (This conforms to the international standard.)

       <b>-v</b>     The <b>-v</b> option makes the output of <b>Remind</b> slightly more verbose.  Currently, this causes <b>Remind</b>  to
              echo a bad line in case of an error, and to print a security message if a script tests the $RunOff
              system variable.

       <b>-o</b>     The  <b>-o</b> option causes <b>Remind</b> to ignore all <b>ONCE</b> directives.  Note that <b>ONCE</b> is also ignored if any
              of the <b>-c</b>, <b>-n</b>, <b>-p</b>, or <b>-s</b> options is used, if a repetition factor <b>*n</b> is used, or if  a  date  other
              than today's date is specified on the command-line.

       <b>-t</b>     The <b>-t</b> option causes <b>Remind</b> to trigger all non-expired reminders, regardless of the <u>delta</u> supplied
              for each reminder.

       <b>-t</b><u>n</u>    If  you  supply  a number <u>n</u> after the <b>-t</b> option, then <b>Remind</b> pretends that every <b>REM</b> command has a
              delta of ++<u>n</u>, regardless of any existing delta.

       <b>-tz</b>    If you supply the letter <b>z</b> after the <b>-t</b> option, then <b>Remind</b> sets all  REM  statements'  deltas  to
              zero,  regardless of the value supplied in the REM statement itself.  In effect, this disables all
              deltas of the form <b>+</b><u>n</u> and <b>++</b><u>n</u>.

       <b>-tt</b>[<u>n</u>] The <b>-tt</b> option causes <b>Remind</b> to assume a default delta of <u>n</u> minutes for all timed  reminders.   If
              <b>-tt</b> is given with no <u>n</u>, a default delta of 5 minutes is used.

       <b>-h</b>     The  <b>-h</b> option ("hush...") suppresses certain warning and information messages.  In particular, if
              no reminders are triggered, this mode produces no output.

       <b>-a</b>     The <b>-a</b> option causes <b>Remind</b> not to immediately trigger timed reminders that trigger on the current
              day.  It also causes <b>Remind</b> not to place timed reminders in a calendar.  If you supply two or more
              <b>-a</b> options, then <b>Remind</b> <u>will</u> trigger timed reminders that are in the future, but will not  trigger
              timed reminders whose time has passed.  (Regardless of how many <b>-a</b> options you supply, <b>Remind</b> will
              not include timed reminders in the calendar if at least one <b>-a</b> option is used.)

       <b>-q</b>     The <b>-q</b> option causes <b>Remind</b> not to queue timed reminders for later execution.

       <b>-f</b>     The  <b>-f</b>  option causes <b>Remind</b> to remain in the foreground when processing queued reminders, rather
              than forking off a background process to handle them.

       <b>-e</b>     The <b>-e</b> option diverts error messages (normally sent to the standard error stream) to the  standard
              output stream.

       <b>-d</b><u>chars</u>
              The <b>-d</b> option enables certain debugging modes.  The <u>chars</u> specify which modes to enable:

         <b>e</b>      Echo all input lines

         <b>x</b>      Trace all expression evaluation

         <b>t</b>      Display all trigger date computation

         <b>v</b>      Dump the variable table after execution of the reminder script

         <b>l</b>      Echo lines when displaying error messages

         <b>f</b>      Trace the reading of reminder files

         <b>s</b>      Trace  expression parsing and display the internal expression node tree.  This is unlikely to be
                useful unless you are working on <b>Remind</b>'s expression evaluation engine.

         <b>h</b>      Dump hash-table statistics on exit.

         <b>q</b>      Output a TRANSLATE command each  time  the  <b>_()</b>  built-in  function  is  called  or  the  <b>%(...)</b>
                substitution sequence is encountered.

       <b>-g</b>[<b>a|d</b>[<b>a|d</b>[<b>a|d</b>[<b>a|d</b>]]]]
              Normally,  reminders are issued in the order in which they are encountered in the reminder script.
              The <b>-g</b> option cause <b>Remind</b> to sort reminders by date and time prior to issuing them.  The optional
              <b>a</b> and <b>d</b> characters specify the sort order  (ascending  or  descending)  for  the  date,  time  and
              priority fields.  See the section "SORTING REMINDERS" for more information.

              Note that <b>-g</b> is <u>ignored</u> if you use the <b>-n</b> option.

       <b>-b</b>[<u>n</u>]  Set  the  time format for the calendar and simple-calendar outputs.  <u>N</u> can range from 0 to 2, with
              the default 0.  A value of 0 causes times to be inserted in  12-hour  (am/pm)  format.   1  causes
              times  to  be  inserted  in 24-hour format, and 2 inhibits the automatic insertion of times in the
              calendar output.

       <b>-x</b>[<u>n</u>]  Sets the iteration limit for the <b>SATISFY</b> clause of a <b>REM</b> command.  Defaults to 1000.

       <b>-k</b><u>cmd</u>  Instead of simply printing <b>MSG</b>-type reminders, this causes them to be passed to the specific  <u>cmd</u>.
              You  must  use  '%s'  where  you  want  the body to appear, and may need to enclose this option in
              quotes.  Note that all shell characters in the body of the reminder are escaped with a  backslash,
              and  the  entire  body  of  the  reminder  is  passed as a single argument.  Note that this option
              <b>overrides</b> the <b>-r</b> option and the <b>RUN</b> <b>OFF</b> command.

              As an example, suppose you have an X Window program called <b>xmessage</b> that  pops  up  a  window  and
              displays its invocation arguments.  You could use:

                        remind '-kxmessage %s &amp;' ...

              to have all of your <b>MSG</b>-type reminders processed using xmessage.

              A word of warning: It is very easy to spawn dozens of xmessage processes with the above technique.
              So  be  very  careful.   Because  all shell and whitespace characters are escaped, the program you
              execute with the <b>-k</b> option must be prepared to handle the entire message as a single argument.

              If you follow the <b>-k</b> option with a colon, then  the  command  is  applied  only  to  queued  timed
              reminders.   Normal  reminders  are  handled  as  usual.  In the above example, if you want normal
              reminders to simply be displayed as usual, but queued reminders to be  sent  to  notify-send,  you
              could use:

                        remind '-k:notify-send %s &amp;' ...

              You use both <b>-k</b><u>cmd1</u> and <b>-k:</b><u>cmd2</u> to use different commands for queued versus non-queued reminders.

       <b>-z</b>[<u>n</u>] Runs <b>Remind</b> in "daemon mode".  If <u>n</u>
              is  supplied,  it  specifies how often (in minutes) <b>Remind</b> should wake up to check if the reminder
              script has been changed.  <u>N</u> defaults to 1, and can range from 1 to 60.  Note that the use  of  the
              <b>-z</b> option also enables the <b>-f</b> option.

              If  <b>Remind</b>  is compiled on a system that supports <b><a href="../man7/inotify.7.html">inotify</a></b>(7), then if the reminder script supplied
              on the command-line is actually a directory, <b>Remind</b> additionally checks if all files  within  that
              directory have been modified since startup.

              If  you  supply  the  option  <b>-zj</b>,  <b>Remind</b>  runs  in  a  special mode called <b>server</b> <b>mode</b>.  This is
              documented in the tkremind man page; see <a href="../man1/tkremind.1.html">tkremind</a>(1).  The older  server  mode  option  <b>-z0</b>  still
              works,  but  is  deprecated;  it  uses an ad-hoc method to communicate with the client rather than
              using JSON to communicate with the client.

       <b>-u</b><u>name</u> Runs <b>Remind</b> with the uid and gid of the user specified by <u>name</u>.  The option changes  the  uid  and
              gid  as  described, and sets the environment variables HOME, SHELL and USER to the home directory,
              shell, and user name, respectively, of the specified user.  LOGNAME is also set to  the  specified
              user  name.  This option is meant for use in shell scripts that mail reminders to all users.  Note
              that as of Remind 3.00.17, using <b>-u</b> implies <b>-r</b> -- the RUN  directive  and  shell()  functions  are
              disabled.  However, if you prefix <u>name</u> with a <b>+</b>-sign, then RUN and shell() are <u>not</u> disabled.  That
              is,  <b>-uwhatever</b>  switches  the user to <b>whatever</b> and disables RUN, whereas <b>-u+whatever</b> switches the
              user to <b>whatever</b> but leaves RUN enabled.

              Non-root users can also use the <b>-u</b> option.  However, in this case, it only changes the environment
              variables as described above.  It does not change the effective uid or gid.

       <b>-+</b><u>username</u>
              Causes <b>Remind</b> to trust files owned by the user <u>username</u>.  Normally, if <b>Remind</b> reads  a  file  that
              you  do  not  own,  it disables RUN and the shell() function.  This option causes it to also trust
              files owned by <u>username</u>.  You can supply multiple <b>-+</b> options to trust  multiple  users,  up  to  a
              limit of 20 trusted users.

       <b>-y</b>     Causes <b>Remind</b> to synthesize a tag for any reminder that lacks a TAG clause.

       <b>-i</b><u>var</u><b>=</b><u>expr</u>
              Sets  the  value  of  the  specified <u>var</u> to <u>expr</u>, and <b>preserves</b> <u>var</u>.  <u>Expr</u> can be any valid <b>Remind</b>
              expression.  See the section "INITIALIZING VARIABLES ON THE COMMAND LINE" for  more  details.   If
              you  omit the <b>=</b><u>expr</u> part, then <u>var</u> is initialized to 0.  In other words, <b>-i</b><u>var</u> is exactly the same
              as <b>-i</b><u>var</u><b>=</b>0.

       <b>-i</b><u>func</u>(<u>args</u>)=<u>definition</u>
              Allows you to define a function on the command line.

       If you supply a <u>date</u> on the command line, it must consist of <u>day</u> <u>month</u> <u>year</u>, where <u>day</u> is the day of  the
       month,  <u>month</u>  is  at  least the first three letters of the English name of the month, and <u>year</u> is a year
       (all 4 digits) from 1990 to about 2075.  You can leave out the <u>day</u>, which then defaults to 1.

       If you do supply a <u>date</u> on the command line, then <b>Remind</b> uses it, rather than the actual system date,  as
       its  notion  of  "today."   This  lets  you  create  calendars for future months, or test to see how your
       reminders will be triggered in the future.  Similarly, you can supply a <u>time</u> to set  <b>Remind</b>'s  notion  of
       "now"  to  a particular time.  Supplying a <u>time</u> on the command line also implicitly enables the <b>-q</b> option
       and disables the <b>-z</b> option.  The <u>time</u> may be specified in 24-hour format (eg, 13:20)  or  common  "AM/PM"
       format (1:20pm).

       If you would rather specify the date more succinctly, you can supply it as YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY/MM/DD.  You
       can even supply a date and time on the command line as one argument: YYYY-MM-DD@HH:MM.

       In  addition,  you  can supply a <u>repeat</u> parameter, which has the form *<u>rep</u>.  This causes <b>Remind</b> to be run
       <u>rep</u> times, with the date incrementing on each iteration.  You may have to enclose the parameter in quotes
       to avoid shell expansion.  See the subsection "Repeated Execution" in the  section  "CALENDAR  MODE"  for
       more information.

</pre><h4><b>LONG</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Remind</b> supports the following long options, which <u>are</u> case-sensitive:

       <b>--version</b>  The  <b>--version</b>  option  causes  <b>Remind</b> to print its version number to standard output and then
       exit.

       <b>--print-errs</b>
              The <b>--print-errs</b> option causes <b>Remind</b> to print all possible error messages to standard output  and
              then  exit.   The  messages are printed in a format suitable for the first argument of a TRANSLATE
              command.  If you TRANSLATE the error messages, then <b>Remind</b> will use the translated  versions  when
              outputting  error  and  warning  messages.   See  also  TRANSLATE  GENERATE  in  the  section "THE
              TRANSLATION TABLE".

              Note that if an untranslated message contains printf-style formatting sequences like "%s" or "%d",
              then the translated message <u>must</u> contain the same sequences in the  same  order,  or  <b>Remind</b>  will
              ignore it and use the original untranslated message.

       <b>--print-config-cmd</b>
              This  option  causes  <b>Remind</b>  to print the exact <b>./configure</b> command that was used when <b>Remind</b> was
              built.  You can use this to build a new version of <b>Remind</b>  using  the  same  configuration  as  an
              existing one by running:

                      eval `remind --print-config-cmd`

              from  the  top-level  <b>Remind</b> source directory.  (However, it's safer to simply run <b>remind</b> <b>--print-</b>
              <b>config-cmd</b> and then type in the command once you've verified that it looks OK.)

       <b>--print-tokens</b>
              The <b>--print-tokens</b> option causes <b>Remind</b> to print the tokens used by the parser, built-in  function
              names,  and  system  variable  names to standard output and then exit.  This output is designed to
              make it easy to create a syntax-highlighting file for various text editors.   The  output  can  be
              modified by hand or by a script into a syntax-highlighting file with relative ease.

       <b>--max-execution-time</b>=<u>n</u>
              Limit  the  total  execution time (as measured by the wall clock) to <u>n</u> seconds.  This is useful if
              <b>Remind</b> is invoked on potentially-untrustworthy files that could attempt to use a lot of resources.
              Note that the limit <u>n</u> is approximate and <b>Remind</b> might execute for one or two more  seconds  before
              it  is killed.  If <u>n</u> is specified as zero, then no limit is applied, just as if the option had not
              been used at all.

              If a limit is applied, it applies only to the  foreground  run  of  <b>Remind</b>.   If  <b>Remind</b>  finishes
              processing  the  script  and  then starts handling queued reminders, the time limit is reset to no
              limit.

       <b>--test</b> The <b>--test</b> long option is only for use by the acceptance tests run by "make  test".   Do  not  use
              this option in production.

</pre><h4><b>REMINDER</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Remind</b> uses scripts to control its operation.  You can use any text editor capable of creating plain-text
       files  to create a <b>Remind</b> script.  The commands inside a script can range from the very simple and almost
       immediately understandable:

               REM Mar 31 MSG International Transgender Day of Visibility

       to the baroque and obscure:

               REM [date(thisyear, 1, 1) + 180] ++5 OMIT \
               sat sun BEFORE MSG [ord(thisyear-1980)] payment due %b!

       A reminder file consists of commands, with one command per line.  Several lines can  be  continued  using
       the  backslash  character,  as  in  the  above  example.  In this case, all of the concatenated lines are
       treated as a single line by <b>Remind</b>.  Note that if an error occurs, <b>Remind</b> reports the line number of  the
       last line of a continued line.

       <b>Remind</b>  ignores  blank  lines,  and  lines  beginning  with  the  '#' or ';' characters.  You can use the
       semicolon as a comment character if you wish to pass a <b>Remind</b> script through the C  pre-processor,  which
       interprets the '#' character as the start of a pre-processing directive.

       Note that <b>Remind</b> processes line continuations before anything else.  For example:

            # This is a comment \
            This line is part of the comment because of line continuation \
            and so on.
            REM MSG This line is not ignored (no \ above)

       <b>Remind</b>  is  not  case  sensitive; you can generally use any mixture of upper- or lower-case for commands,
       parameters, invocation options, etc.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>REM</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       The most powerful command in a <b>Remind</b> script is the <b>REM</b> command.  This command is responsible for issuing
       reminders.  Its syntax is:

              <b>REM</b> [<b>ONCE</b>] [<u>date_spec</u>] [<u>back</u>] [<u>delta</u>] [<u>repeat</u>] [<b>PRIORITY</b> <u>prio</u>]  [<b>SKIP</b>  |  <b>BEFORE</b>  |  <b>AFTER</b>]  [<b>OMIT</b>
              <u>omit_list</u>]  [<b>ADDOMIT</b>]  [<b>NOQUEUE</b>]  [<b>OMITFUNC</b>  <u>omit_function</u>]  [<b>AT</b>  <u>time</u>  [<u>tdelta</u>] [<u>trepeat</u>]] [<b>SCHED</b>
              <u>sched_function</u>] [<b>WARN</b> <u>warn_function</u>] [<b>UNTIL</b> <u>expiry_date</u> | <b>THROUGH</b> <u>last_date</u>] [<b>SCANFROM</b> <u>scan_date</u> |
              <b>FROM</b> <u>start_date</u>] [<b>DURATION</b> <u>duration</u>] [<b>TAG</b> <u>tag</u>] [<b>INFO</b> "<u>info_string</u>"] <b>MSG</b>  |  <b>MSF</b>  |  <b>RUN</b>  |  <b>CAL</b>  |
              <b>SATISFY</b> | <b>SPECIAL</b> <u>special</u> | <b>PS</b> | <b>PSFILE</b> <u>body</u>

       The  parts  of  the <b>REM</b> command can be specified in any order, except that the <u>body</u> must come immediately
       after the <b>MSG</b>, <b>RUN</b>, <b>CAL</b>, <b>PS</b>, <b>PSFILE</b> or <b>SATISFY</b> keyword.  The portion of the <b>REM</b> command before  the  <b>MSG</b>,
       <b>MSF</b> <b>RUN</b>, <b>CAL</b> or <b>SATISFY</b> clause is called a <u>trigger</u>.

       In  earlier  versions  of  <b>Remind</b>, the <b>REM</b> token was optional providing that the remainder of the command
       cannot be mistaken for another <b>Remind</b> command.  However, this use is deprecated  and  will  now  cause  a
       warning to be issued.  All of your reminder lines should be written to start with the REM command.

       <b>MSG,</b> <b>MSF,</b> <b>RUN,</b> <b>CAL,</b> <b>SPECIAL,</b> <b>PS</b> <b>and</b> <b>PSFILE</b>

       These  keywords  denote  the  <u>type</u>  of  the reminder.  (<b>SATISFY</b> is more complicated and will be explained
       later.)  A <b>MSG</b>-type reminder normally prints a message to the standard output,  after  passing  the  <u>body</u>
       through  a  special substitution filter, described in the section "THE SUBSTITUTION FILTER."  However, if
       you have used the <b>-k</b> command-line option, then <b>MSG</b>-type reminders are passed to the appropriate  program.
       Note that the options <b>-c</b>, <b>-s</b>, <b>-p</b> and <b>-n</b> disable the <b>-k</b> option.

       Earlier  versions  of <b>Remind</b> let you omit the reminder type, in which case it defaulted to <b>MSG</b>.  However,
       this usage is deprecated and will cause a warning.  Something like:

            REM 6 January Dianne's Birthday

       will issue the warning "Missing REM type; assuming MSG"

       The <b>MSF</b> keyword is almost the same as the <b>MSG</b> keyword, except that the reminder is formatted to fit  into
       a  paragraph-like format.  Three system variables control the formatting of <b>MSF</b>-type reminders - they are
       <b>$FirstIndent</b>, <b>$SubsIndent</b> and <b>$FormWidth</b>.  They are discussed in the section "SYSTEM VARIABLES."  The <b>MSF</b>
       keyword causes the spacing of your reminder to be altered - extra spaces are discarded,  and  two  spaces
       are  placed  after  periods  and  other  characters,  as  specified  by the system variables <b>$EndSent</b> and
       <b>$EndSentIg</b>.  Note that if the body of the reminder includes newline characters (placed there with the  %_
       sequence),  then  the  newlines  are  treated  as  the beginnings of new paragraphs, and the <b>$FirstIndent</b>
       indentation is used for the next line.  You can use two consecutive newlines to  have  spaced  paragraphs
       emitted from a single reminder body.

       A <b>RUN</b>-type reminder also passes the <u>body</u> through the substitution filter, but then executes the result as
       a system command.  A <b>CAL</b>-type reminder is used only to place entries in the calendar produced when <b>Remind</b>
       is run with the <b>-c</b>, <b>-s</b> or <b>-p</b> options.

       A  <b>PS</b>  or  <b>PSFILE</b>-type  reminder  is  used to pass PostScript code directly to the printer when producing
       PostScript calendars.  This can be used to shade certain calendar entries (see the  psshade()  function),
       include graphics in the calendar, or almost any other purpose you can think of.  You should not use these
       types  of  reminders  unless  you  are  an expert PostScript programmer.  The <b>PS</b> and <b>PSFILE</b> reminders are
       ignored unless <b>Remind</b> is run with the <b>-p</b> option.  See  the  section  "More  about  PostScript"  for  more
       details.

       A  <b>SPECIAL</b>-type  reminder  is  used to pass "out-of-band" information from <b>Remind</b> to a calendar-producing
       back-end.  It should be followed by a word indicating the type of special data being passed.  The type of
       a special reminder depends on the back-end.  For the <b>Rem2PS</b> back-end, <b>SPECIAL</b> <b>PostScript</b> is equivalent to
       a <b>PS</b>-type reminder, and <b>SPECIAL</b> <b>PSFile</b> is equivalent to a <b>PSFILE</b>-type reminder.  The body  of  a  <b>SPECIAL</b>
       reminder  is  obviously  dependent  upon the back-end.  A back-end <u>must</u> ignore a <b>SPECIAL</b> that it does not
       recognize.

       <b>DATE</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b>

       A <u>date_spec</u> consists of zero to four parts.  These parts are <u>day</u> (day of month), <u>month</u> (month name), <u>year</u>
       and <u>weekday.</u>  <u>Month</u> and <u>weekday</u> are the English names of months and weekdays.  At least the  first  three
       characters must be used.  The following are examples of the various parts of a <u>date_spec:</u>

       <u>day:</u>   1, 22, 31, 14, 3

       <u>month:</u> JANUARY, feb, March, ApR, may, Aug

       <u>year:</u>  1990, 1993, 2030.  The year can range from 1990 to 2075.

       <u>weekday:</u>
              Monday, tue, Wed, THU, Friday, saturday, sundAy

       Note that there can be several <u>weekday</u> components separated by spaces in a <u>date_spec.</u>

       <b>INTERPRETATION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>DATE</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b>

       The following examples show how date specifications are interpreted.

       1. Null date specification - the reminder is triggered every day.  The trigger date for a specific run is
       simply the current system date.  For example:

               REM MSG This is triggered every time Remind runs

       2. Only <u>day</u> present.  The reminder is triggered on the specified day of each month.  The trigger date for
       a particular run is the closest such day to the current system date.  For example:

            REM 1 MSG First of every month.
            REM 31 MSG 31st of every month that has 31 days.

       3. Only <u>month</u> present.  The reminder is triggered every day of the specified month.  Example:

            REM Feb MSG Every day in February

       4.  <u>day</u> and <u>month</u> present.  Examples:

            REM 6 Jan MSG Every 6th of January
            REM Feb 29 MSG Every 29th of February

       5.  Only <u>year</u> present. Example:

            REM 1991 MSG Every day in 1991

       6.  <u>year</u> and <u>day</u> present.  Examples:

            REM 1 1990 MSG 1st of every month in 1990
            REM 1992 23 MSG 23rd of every month in 1992

       7.  <u>year</u> and <u>month</u> present.  Examples:

            REM Feb 1991 MSG Every day in Feb 1991
            REM 1992 September MSG Every day in Sept 1992

       8.  <u>year,</u> <u>month</u> and <u>day</u> present.  Examples:

            REM 8 Jan 1991 MSG 8th January 1991.
            REM 1992 March 9 MSG 9th March 1992.

       9.  <u>weekday</u> only.  Examples:

            REM Sat MSG Every Saturday
            REM Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri MSG Every working day
            REM Monday Wednesday MSG Every Monday and Wednesday

       10.  <u>weekday</u> and <u>day</u> present.  Examples:

            REM Sat 1 MSG First Saturday of every month
            REM Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri 15 \
                 MSG 1st working day on or after 15th of every month

       11.  <u>weekday</u> and <u>month</u> present.  Examples:

            REM Mon March MSG Every Monday in March
            REM Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Feb MSG Every working day in February

       12.  <u>weekday,</u> <u>month</u> and <u>day</u> present.  Examples:

            REM Mon 1 March MSG First Monday in March
            REM Sat Sun 15 July MSG First Sat or Sun on or after 15 July

       13.  <u>weekday</u> and <u>year</u> present.  Example:

            REM Sat Sun 1991 MSG Every Saturday and Sunday in 1991

       14.  <u>weekday,</u> <u>day</u> and <u>year</u> present.  Examples:

            REM Mon 15 1990 MSG 1st Mon after 15th of every month in 1990
            REM Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri 1 1990 \
                 MSG 1st working day of every month in 1990

       15.  <u>weekday,</u> <u>month</u> and <u>year</u> present.  Example:

            REM Mon Wed 1991 Feb MSG Every Mon and Wed in Feb 1991.

       16.  <u>weekday,</u> <u>day,</u> <u>month</u> and <u>year</u> present.  Example:

            REM Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri 28 Oct 1990 \
                 MSG 1st working day on or after 28 October 1990.

       Note  that  when  both  <u>weekday</u>  and  <u>day</u>  are  specified,  <b>Remind</b> chooses the first date on or after the
       specified <u>day</u> that also satisfies the <u>weekday</u> constraint.  It does this by picking the first date  on  or
       after the specified <u>day</u> that is listed in the list of <u>weekdays.</u>  Thus, a reminder like:

            REM Mon Tue 28 Oct 1990 MSG Hi

       would  be  issued only on Monday, 29 October, 1990.  It would not be issued on Tuesday, 30 October, 1990,
       since the 29th is the first date to satisfy the <u>weekday</u> constraints.

       <b>SHORT-HAND</b> <b>DATE</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b>

       In addition to spelling out the day, month and year separately, you can specify YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY/MM/DD.
       For example, the following statements are equivalent:

            REM 5 June 2010 MSG Cool!
            REM 2010-06-05  MSG Cool!

       You can also specify a date and time as YYYY-MM-DD@HH:MM.  These statements are equivalent:

            REM 19 Dec 2010 AT 16:45 MSG Hi
            REM 2010-12-19@16:45 MSG Hi

       There's one subtlety with short-hand date specifications:  The following statements are <u>not</u> equivalent:

            REM 19 Dec 2010 AT 16:45 +60 MSG Hi
            REM 2010-12-19@16:45 +60 MSG Hi

       In the second statement, the "+60" is a <u>delta</u> that applies to the date rather than a <u>tdelta</u> that  applies
       to the time.  We recommend explicitly using the AT keyword with timed reminders.

       <b>THE</b> <b>REMIND</b> <b>ALGORITHM</b>

       <b>Remind</b>  uses  the  following  algorithm  to  compute  a  trigger date: Starting from the current date, it
       examines each day, one at a time, until it finds a date that satisfies the date specification, or  proves
       to  itself  that  no such date exists.  (Actually, <b>Remind</b> merely <u>behaves</u> as if it used this algorithm; it
       would be much too slow in practice.  Internally, <b>Remind</b>  uses  much  faster  techniques  to  calculate  a
       trigger date.)  See DETAILS ABOUT TRIGGER COMPUTATION for more information.

       <b>BACKWARD</b> <b>SCANNING</b>

       Sometimes,  it  is  necessary  to  specify a date as being a set amount of time before another date.  For
       example, the last Monday in a given month is computed as the first Monday in  the  next  month,  minus  7
       days.  The <u>back</u> specification in the reminder is used in this case:

            REM Mon 1 -7 MSG Last Monday of every month.

       A  <u>back</u>  is  specified  with  one  or  two  dashes  followed  by  an integer.  This causes <b>Remind</b> to move
       "backwards" from what would normally be the trigger date.  The difference between  --7  and  -7  will  be
       explained when the <b>OMIT</b> keyword is described.

       <b>ADVANCE</b> <b>WARNING</b>

       For some reminders, it is appropriate to receive advance warning of the event.  For example, you may wish
       to  be  reminded  of  someone's  birthday  several days in advance.  The <u>delta</u> portion of the <b>REM</b> command
       achieves this.  It is specified as one or two "+" signs followed by a number <u>n</u>.   Again,  the  difference
       between  the  "+"  and  "++"  forms  will  be  explained under the <b>OMIT</b> keyword.  <b>Remind</b> will trigger the
       reminder on computed trigger date, as well as on each of the <u>n</u> days before  the  event.   Here  are  some
       examples:

            REM 6 Jan +5 MSG Remind me of birthday 5 days in advance.

       The above example would be triggered every 6th of January, as well as the 1st through 5th of January.

       <b>PERIODIC</b> <b>REMINDERS</b>

       We  have  already seen some built-in mechanisms for certain types of periodic reminders.  For example, an
       event occurring every Wednesday could be specified as:

            REM Wed MSG Event!

       However, events that do not repeat daily, weekly, monthly or yearly require another approach.  The <u>repeat</u>
       component of the <b>REM</b> command fills this need.  To use it, you must completely specify a date (year, month
       and day, and optionally weekday); this is the start date of the repetition period.  The <u>repeat</u>  component
       is an asterisk followed by a number specifying the repetition period in days.

       For example, suppose you get paid every second Wednesday, and your last payday was Wednesday, 28 October,
       1992.  You can use:

            REM 28 Oct 1992 *14 MSG Payday

       This  issues  the  reminder  every  14  days, starting from 28 Oct 1992.  You can use <u>delta</u> and <u>back</u> with
       <u>repeat.</u>  Note, however, that the <u>back</u> is used only to compute the starting date; thereafter, the reminder
       repeats with the specified period.  Similarly, if you specify a weekday, it is used only to calculate the
       starting date, and does not affect the repetition period.

       <b>SCANFROM</b> and <b>FROM</b>

       The <b>SCANFROM</b> and <b>FROM</b> keywords are for advanced <b>Remind</b> programmers only, and will  be  explained  in  the
       section "DETAILS ABOUT TRIGGER COMPUTATION" near the end of this manual.  Note that <b>SCANFROM</b> is available
       only in versions of <b>Remind</b> from 03.00.04 up.  <b>FROM</b> is available only from 03.01.00 and later.

       <b>PRIORITY</b>

       The  <b>PRIORITY</b>  keyword must be followed by a number from 0 to 9999.  It is used in calendar mode and when
       sorting reminders.  If two reminders have the same trigger  date  and  time,  then  they  are  sorted  by
       priority.   If  the  <b>PRIORITY</b> keyword is not supplied, a default priority of 5000 is used.  (This default
       can be changed by adjusting the system variable <b>$DefaultPrio</b>.  See the  section  "SYSTEM  VARIABLES"  for
       more information.)

       <b>EXPIRY</b> <b>DATES</b>

       Some  reminders  should be issued periodically for a certain time, but then expire.  For example, suppose
       you have a class every Friday, and that your last class is on 11 December 1992.  You can use:

            REM Fri UNTIL 11 Dec 1992 MSG Class today.

       Another example:  Suppose you have jury duty from 30 November 1992 until 4 December 1992.  The  following
       reminder will issue the message every day of your jury duty, as well as 2 days ahead of time:

            REM 1992-11-30 *1 +2 UNTIL 1992-12-04 MSG Jury duty

       Note  that  the  <u>repeat</u>  of *1 is necessary; without it, the reminder would be issued only on 30 November
       (and the two days preceding.)

       As a special case, you can use the <b>THROUGH</b> keyword instead of  *1  and  <b>UNTIL</b>.   The  following  two  <b>REM</b>
       commands are equivalent:

            REM 1992-11-30 *1 +2 UNTIL 1992-12-04 MSG Jury duty

            REM 1992-11-30 +2 THROUGH 1992-12-04 MSG Jury duty

       If  you  have an expiry date via the use of <b>THROUGH</b> or <b>UNTIL</b>, then Remind will <u>never</u> trigger the reminder
       after the expiry date.  For example, if you have this:

               OMIT 2021-01-08
               REM 2021-01-01 THROUGH 2021-01-08 AFTER MSG Test

       the reminder will not be triggered on 2021-01-08, and nor will it be triggered on 2021-01-09; even though
       the AFTER keyword would normally move the 8th's reminder to  the  9th,  the  expiry  date  of  2021-01-08
       overrides that.

       <b>THE</b> <b>ONCE</b> <b>KEYWORD</b>

       Sometimes,  it  is  necessary  to  ensure  that reminders are run only once on a given day.  For example,
       compare the following two reminders:

               REM Fri RUN do_backup
               REM Fri ONCE RUN do_backup

       The first will be run every time you invoke <b>Remind</b> on a Friday, whereas the second will be run  only  the
       first time you invoke <b>Remind</b> on a given Friday.

       If  you  run <b>Remind</b> from your .login script, for example, and log in several times per day, the <u>do_backup</u>
       program in the first reminder will be run each time you log in.  If, however, you use the <b>ONCE</b> keyword in
       the reminder, the <b>Remind</b> checks the last access date of the reminder script.  If it is the  same  as  the
       current  date,  <b>Remind</b>  assumes that it has already been run, and will not issue reminders containing the
       <b>ONCE</b> keyword.

       Note that if you view or edit your reminder script, the last access date will be updated,  and  the  <b>ONCE</b>
       keyword  will not operate properly.  You can fix this by setting a timestamp file for <b>Remind</b> to track the
       last-run date; see the documentation of <b>$OnceFile</b> in the <b>SYSTEM</b> <b>VARIABLES</b> section.  If you  use  standard
       input as your <b>Remind</b> input file, then you <u>must</u> use <b>$OnceFile</b> for the <b>ONCE</b> keyword to work properly.

       If  you  start <b>Remind</b> with the <b>-o</b> option, then the <b>ONCE</b> keyword will be ignored and any <b>$OnceFile</b> will be
       ignored.

       <b>LOCALLY</b> <b>OMITTING</b> <b>WEEKDAYS</b>

       The <b>OMIT</b> portion of the <b>REM</b> command is used to "omit" certain days when counting the <u>delta</u> or  <u>back</u>.   It
       is  specified using the keyword <b>OMIT</b> followed by a list of weekdays.  Its action is best illustrated with
       examples:

            REM 1 +1 OMIT Sat Sun MSG Important Event

       This reminder is normally triggered on the first of every  month,  as  well  as  the  day  preceding  it.
       However,  if  the first of the month falls on a Sunday or Monday, then the reminder is triggered starting
       from the previous Friday.  This is because the <u>delta</u> of +1 does not count  Saturday  or  Sunday  when  it
       counts backwards from the trigger date to determine how much advance warning to give.

       Contrast this with the use of "++1" in the above command.  In this case, the reminder is triggered on the
       first of each month, as well as the day preceding it.  The omitted days are counted.

            REM 1 -1 OMIT Sat Sun MSG Last working day of month

       Again,  in  the  above example, the <u>back</u> of -1 normally causes the trigger date to be the last day of the
       month.  However, because of the <b>OMIT</b> clause, if the first of the month falls on a Sunday or  Monday,  the
       trigger  date is moved backwards past the weekend to Friday.  (If you have globally omitted holidays, the
       reminder will be moved back past them, also.  See "The OMIT command" for more details.)

       By comparison, if we had used "--1", the reminder would be triggered  on  the  last  day  of  the  month,
       regardless of the <b>OMIT</b>.

       If  you  locally omit weekdays but also have globally-omitted weekdays, then the list of omitted weekdays
       is the union of the two.  Consider this example:

               OMIT Sat Sun
               REM 15 OMIT Fri Sat MSG Whatever

       In the REM command, the effective list of omitted weekdays will be Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

       <b>COMPUTED</b> <b>LOCAL</b> <b>OMITS</b>

       The <b>OMITFUNC</b> phrase of the <b>REM</b> command allows you to supply a function that determines whether or  not  a
       date  is  omitted.   Note  that <b>OMITFUNC</b> must be given just the name of a user-defined function; it can't
       take an arbitrary expression or the name of a built-in function.

       The function is passed a single parameter of type <b>DATE</b>, and must return a non-zero integer if the date is
       considered "omitted" and 0 otherwise.  Here's an example:

               FSET _third(x) (day(x) % 3) || \
                              (wkdaynum(x) == 0) || \
                              (wkdaynum(x) == 6)
               REM OMITFUNC _third AFTER MSG Working day divisible by 3

       In the example above, the reminder is triggered every Monday  to  Friday  whose  day-of-month  number  is
       divisible by three.  Here's how it works:

       <b>o</b>      The  <b>OMITFUNC</b> <b>_third</b> portion causes all days for which <b>_third(x)</b> returns non-zero to be considered
              "omitted".  This causes all days whose day-of-month number is  <u>not</u>  a  multiple  of  three  to  be
              omitted.  Note that _third also returns non-zero if the weekday is Sunday or Saturday.

       <b>o</b>      The <b>AFTER</b> keyword causes the reminder to be moved after a block of omitted days.

       The  combination of OMITFUNC and AFTER keyword causes the reminder to be issued on all days whose day-of-
       month number is divisible by three, but not on Saturday or Sunday.

       Note that if you use <b>OMITFUNC</b>, then a local <b>OMIT</b> is <u>ignored</u> as are <u>all</u> <u>global</u> <u>OMITs</u>.  If you want to omit
       specific weekdays, your omit function will need to test for them specifically.  If you want to take  into
       account the global <b>OMIT</b> context, then your omit function will need to test for that explicitly (using the
       <b>isomitted()</b> function.)

       Note  that  an  incorrect  <b>OMITFUNC</b> might cause all days to be considered omitted.  For that reason, when
       <b>Remind</b> searches through omitted days,  it  terminates  the  search  after  the  <b>SATISFY</b>  iteration  limit
       (command-line option <b>-x</b>.)

       <b>ADDING</b> <b>TRIGGER</b> <b>DATES</b> <b>TO</b> <b>THE</b> <b>OMIT</b> <b>CONTEXT</b>

       If  the  <b>ADDOMIT</b>  keyword appears in a <b>REM</b> command, then the trigger date (if one could be calculated) is
       automatically added to the list of global OMITs.

       The command:

               REM ... whatever ... ADDOMIT MSG Foo

       is identical in behavior to the sequence:

               REM ... whatever ... SATISFY 1
               IF trigvalid()
                   OMIT [trigdate()] MSG Foo
               ENDIF

       <b>TIMED</b> <b>REMINDERS</b>

       Timed reminders are those that have an <b>AT</b> keyword followed by a <u>time</u> and  optional  <u>tdelta</u>  and  <u>trepeat</u>.
       The  <u>time</u>  may  be specified in 24-hour format, with 0:00 representing midnight, 12:00 representing noon,
       and 23:59 representing one minute to midnight.  Alternatively, it may  be  specified  in  common  "AM/PM"
       format;  in this case, the hour must range from 1 to 12.  12:00am represents midnight, 12:00pm represents
       noon, and 11:59pm represents one minute to midnight.  The "am" and "pm" portions are case-insensitive and
       the "m" is optional.

       You can use either a colon or a period to separate the hours from the minutes.  That is, 13:39 and  13.39
       are equivalent.

       <b>Remind</b>  treats  timed  reminders  specially.  If the trigger date for a timed reminder is the same as the
       current system date, the reminder is queued for later activation.  When <b>Remind</b>  has  finished  processing
       the  reminder  file, it puts itself in the background, and activates timed reminders when the system time
       reached the specified time.  Note that if you use the <b>NOQUEUE</b> modifier in  the  <b>REM</b>  command,  then  this
       queuing  and  background  activation  is  <u>not</u>  performed.   <b>NOQUEUE</b>  is  useful  if you want a time to be
       associated with a reminder (eg, in the calendar) but are not interested in a popup reminder happening  at
       the specified time.

       If the trigger date is <u>not</u> the same as the system date, the reminder is not queued.

       For  example,  the  following  reminder,  triggered every working day, will emit a message telling you to
       leave at 5:00pm:

            REM Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri AT 17:00 MSG Time to leave!

       The following reminder will be triggered on Thursdays and Fridays, but will only be queued on Fridays:

            REM Fri ++1 AT 1:00PM MSG Lunch at 1pm Friday.

       The <u>tdelta</u> and <u>trepeat</u> have the same form as a <u>repeat</u> and <u>delta</u>,  but  are  specified  in  minutes.   For
       example, this reminder will be triggered at 12:00pm as well as 45 minutes before:

            REM AT 12:00 +45 MSG Example

       The following will be issued starting at 10:45, every half hour until 11:45, and again at noon.

            REM AT 12:00 +75 *30 MSG Example2

       The  "+75"  means  that the reminder is issued starting 75 minutes before noon; in other words, at 10:45.
       The *30 specifies that the reminder is subsequently to  be  issued  every  30  minutes.   Note  that  the
       reminder is always issued at the specified time, even if the <u>tdelta</u> is not a multiple of the <u>trepeat</u>.  So
       the  above  example  is  issued  at  10:45am,  11:15am,  11:45am,  and  12:00pm.   Note  that in the time
       specification, there is no distinction between the "+" and "++" forms of <u>tdelta</u>.

       Normally, <b>Remind</b> will issue timed reminders as it processes the reminder script, as well as queuing  them
       for  later.   If  you  do  not want <b>Remind</b> to issue the reminders when processing the script, but only to
       queue them for later, use the <b>-a</b> command-line option.  If you do not want  reminders  to  be  queued  for
       later, use the <b>-q</b> command-line option.

       Normally,  <b>Remind</b> forks a background process to handle queued reminders.  If you want <b>Remind</b> to remain in
       the foreground, use the <b>-f</b> command-line option.  This is useful, for example, in .xinitrc scripts,  where
       you can use the command:

            remind -fa myreminders &amp;

       This ensures that when you exit X-Windows, the <b>Remind</b> process is killed.

       <b>WARNING</b> <b>ABOUT</b> <b>TIMED</b> <b>REMINDERS</b>

       Note:  If you use user-defined functions or variables (described later) in the bodies of timed reminders,
       then  when  the timed reminders are activated, the variables and functions have the definitions that were
       in effect at the end of the reminder script.  These definitions may <u>not</u> necessarily be those that were in
       effect at the time the reminder was queued.  In addition, the OMIT context is whatever was in  effect  at
       the  end  of the reminder script, which may not necessarily be the same as when the <b>REM</b> command was first
       processed.

       <b>THE</b> <b>SCHED</b> <b>AND</b> <b>WARN</b> <b>KEYWORDS</b>

       The <b>SCHED</b> keyword allows more precise control over the  triggering  of  timed  reminders,  and  the  <b>WARN</b>
       keyword  allows  precise  control  over  the  advance  triggering  of  all  types of reminders.  However,
       discussion must be deferred until after expressions and user-defined functions are  explained.   See  the
       subsection "PRECISE SCHEDULING" further on.

       <b>TAG,</b> <b>INFO</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DURATION</b>

       The  <b>TAG</b> keyword lets you "tag" certain reminders.  This facility is used by certain back-ends or systems
       built around <b>Remind</b>, such as <b>TkRemind</b>.  These  back-ends  have  specific  rules  about  tags;  see  their
       documentation for details.

       The <b>TAG</b> keyword is followed by a tag consisting of up to 48 characters.  You can have as many TAG clauses
       as you like in a given REM statement.  A tag can contain any character except for whitespace and a comma.

       If you supply the <b>-y</b> option to <b>Remind</b>, then any reminder that lacks a <b>TAG</b> will have one synthesized.  The
       synthesized  tag  consists  of the characters "__syn__" followed by the hexadecimal representation of the
       MD5 sum of the REM command line.  This lets you give a more-or-less unique identifier  to  each  distinct
       REM command.

       The  <b>INFO</b>  keyword  is  similar  to  <b>TAG</b>  but  is intended to convey metadata about an event, such as its
       location.  Back-ends will have their own rules about which <u>info_string</u>s they recognize, and  must  ignore
       <u>info_string</u>s  they  don't  recognize. Note that <b>INFO</b> must be followed by a quoted string; you can include
       newlines in the string by supplying them as "\n".

       An INFO string <u>must</u> be of the form "Header: Value".  The header can consist of any  printable  character,
       but  cannot  contain whitespace.  The value can consist of any characters you like.  Space may not appear
       before the colon, but can appear afterwards; such space is not considered to be part of  the  value.   If
       there  is more than one INFO string for a given reminder, there cannot be any duplicate headers.  Case is
       ignored when determining if a header is a duplicate of an existing one.

       For example, a hypothetical back-end might let you set the location and description of  a  reminder  like
       this:

               REM 26 Feb 2025 INFO "Location: Boardroom #2" \
                               INFO "Description: Go over latest pull requests" \
                               MSG Engineering meeting

       The  <b>DURATION</b>  keyword  makes sense only for timed reminders; it specifies the duration of an event.  For
       example, if you have a 90-minute meeting starting at 1:00pm, you could use any of the following:

               REM 5 March 2021 AT 13:00 DURATION 1:30 MSG Meeting
               REM 5 March 2021 AT 13:00 DURATION 90 MSG Meeting
               REM 5 March 2021 AT 1:00pm DURATION 1:30 MSG Meeting
               REM 5 March 2021 AT 1:00pm DURATION 90 MSG Meeting

       For long-duration reminders, it is convenient to use expressions to simplify writing the  DURATION.   For
       example, if you are away from 20 Feb 2023 through 23 Feb 2023 (a total of 4 days) you could write:

               REM 20 Feb AT 00:00 DURATION [4*24]:00 MSG away
               REM 20 Feb AT 00:00 DURATION [4*24*60] MSG away

       Note that <u>duration</u> is specified either as <u>hours</u>:<u>minutes</u> or just as <u>minutes</u> specified as an <u>integer</u>.

       If  you  specify  a duration of 00:00 or 0, then <b>Remind</b> behaves exactly as if no <b>DURATION</b> at all had been
       present.  Although durations specified as <u>hours</u>:<u>minutes</u> look superficially like a time-of-day,  they  are
       not; the <u>hours</u> component is not limited to the range 00-23.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTACTIC</b> <b>SUGAR</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>REM</b></h4><pre>
       The  REM  command  has  syntactic  sugar  to  let  you  express common reminders.  The following pairs of
       reminders are equivalent:

               REM First Monday April MSG Foo
               REM Mon 1 April        MSG Foo

               REM Second Monday May  MSG Bar
               REM Mon 8 May          MSG Bar

               REM Third Monday MSG Third Monday of every month
               REM Mon 15 MSG Third Monday of every month

               REM Fourth Sunday June 2025 MSG Fourth Sunday in June 2025
               REM Sun 22 June 2025 MSG Fourth Sunday in June 2025

               REM Last Monday MSG Last Monday of every month
               REM Mon 1 --7 MSG Last Monday of every month

               REM Last Monday April MSG Last Monday of every April
               REM Mon 1 May --7 MSG  Last Monday of every April

               REM Last Monday December 2025 MSG Last Monday of Dec 2025
               REM Monday 1 Jan 2026 --7 MSG Last Monday of Dec 2025

       Note that <b>Last</b> effectively adjusts the month and year, if necessary, to make the reminder trigger on  the
       correct date.

       The keyword <b>IN</b> is completely ignored, so you can write (for example):

               REM Second Monday in May MSG foo
               REM Last Monday in December 2025 MSG Bar

       An  alternate  form  of  <u>back</u>  makes  writing  reminders  easier.   The following groups of reminders are
       equivalent:

               REM ~~1 MSG Last day of every month
               REM Lastday MSG  Last day of every month
               REM 1 --1 MSG Last day of every month

               REM May ~~1 MSG Last day of May
               REM Lastday May MSG Last day of May
               REM 1 June --1 MSG Last day of May

               REM Dec 2025 ~~1 MSG Last day of December 2025
               REM Lastday Dec 2025 MSG Last day of December 2025
               REM 1 Jan 2026 --1 MSG Last day of December 2025

               REM Apr ~1 OMIT SAT SUN MSG Last workday of April
               REM Lastworkday April OMIT SAT SUN MSG Last workday of April
               REM 1 May -1 OMIT SAT SUN MSG Last workday of April

               REM Apr ~~7 MSG Seventh-last day of April
               REM 1 May --7 MSG Seventh-last day of April

               REM Apr ~2 OMIT SAT SUN MSG Second-last workday of April
               REM 1 May -2 OMIT SAT SUN MSG Second-last workday of April

       As we see, "Lastday" is equivalent to ~~1 and "Lastworkday" to ~1.

       Note that the First/Second/Third/Fourth/Last keywords and the ~ and ~~ form of <u>back</u> imply a value for the
       day   of   the   month;   as   such,   they   cannot   be   combined   with   a    day.     Additionally,
       First/Second/Third/Fourth/Last must have at least one weekday name.  The following are illegal:

               REM First Monday 3 June MSG Huh?
               REM April 3 ~~1 MSG What?
               REM Second June MSG Where's the weekday???

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>SUBSTITUTION</b> <b>FILTER</b></h4><pre>
       Before  being  processed,  the body of a <b>REM</b> command is passed through a substitution filter.  The filter
       scans for  sequences  "%x"  (where  "x"  is  any  letter  and  certain  other  characters)  and  performs
       substitutions as shown below.  (All dates refer to the trigger date of the reminder.)

       <b>%a</b>     is replaced with "on <u>weekday,</u> <u>day</u> <u>month,</u> <u>year</u>"
              For example, consider the reminder:

              REM 18 Oct 1990 +4 MSG Meeting with Bob %a.

              On 16 October 1990, it would print "Meeting with Bob on Thursday, 18 October, 1990."

              On 17 October 1990, it would print "Meeting with Bob tomorrow."

              On 18 October 1990, it would print "Meeting with Bob today."

       <b>%b</b>     is  replaced with "in <u>diff</u> day's time" where <u>diff</u> is the <b>actual</b> number of days between the current
              date and the trigger date.  (<b>OMITs</b> have no effect.)
              For example, consider:

              REM 18 Oct 1990 +4 MSG Meeting with Bob %b.

              On 16 October 1990, it would print "Meeting with Bob in 2 days' time."

              On 17 October 1990, it would print "Meeting with Bob tomorrow."

              On 18 October 1990, it would print "Meeting with Bob today."

       <b>%c</b>     is replaced with "on <u>weekday</u>"
              Example: REM 18 Oct 1990 +4 MSG Meeting with Bob %c.

              On 16 October 1990, it would print "Meeting with Bob on Thursday."

              On 17 October 1990, it would print "Meeting with Bob tomorrow."

              On 18 October 1990, it would print "Meeting with Bob today."

       <b>%d</b>     is replaced with "<u>day</u>", the day of the month.

       <b>%e</b>     is replaced with "on <u>dd-mm-yyyy</u>"

       <b>%f</b>     is replaced with "on <u>mm-dd-yyyy</u>"

       <b>%g</b>     is replaced with "on <u>weekday,</u> <u>day</u> <u>month</u>"

       <b>%h</b>     is replaced with "on <u>dd-mm</u>"

       <b>%i</b>     is replaced with "on <u>mm-dd</u>"

       <b>%j</b>     is replaced with "on <u>weekday,</u> <u>month</u> <u>day-th,</u> <u>year</u>"  This form appends the  characters  "st",  "nd",
              "rd" or "th" to the day of the month, as appropriate.

       <b>%k</b>     is replaced with "on <u>weekday,</u> <u>month</u> <u>day-th</u>"

       <b>%l</b>     is replaced with "on <u>yyyy-mm-dd</u>"

       <b>%m</b>     is replaced with "<u>month</u>", the name of the month.

       <b>%n</b>     is replaced with the number (1 to 12) of the month.

       <b>%o</b>     is  replaced  with " (today)" if and only if the current system date is the same as the date being
              used by <b>Remind</b> as the current date.  Recall that you can specify a date for <b>Remind</b> to use  on  the
              command  line.   This  substitution  is  not generally useful in a <b>REM</b> command, but is useful in a
              <b>BANNER</b> command.  (See "The BANNER Command.")

       <b>%p</b>     is replaced with "s" if the <u>diff</u> between the current date and the trigger date is not 1.  You  can
              use this to construct reminders like:
              REM 1 Jan +4 MSG %x day%p to go before New Year!

       <b>%q</b>     is  replaced with "'s" if the <u>diff</u> between the trigger date and the current date is 1.  Otherwise,
              it is replaced with "s'"  This can be used as follows:
              REM 1 Jan +4 MSG New Year in %x day%q time!

       <b>%r</b>     is replaced with the day of the month (01 to 31) padded with a leading zero if needed  to  pad  to
              two digits.

       <b>%s</b>     is replaced with "st", "nd", "rd" or "th" depending on the day of the month.

       <b>%t</b>     is replaced with the number of the month (01 to 12) padded to two digits with a leading zero.

       <b>%u</b>     is  replaced  with "on <u>weekday,</u> <u>day-th</u> <u>month,</u> <u>year</u>"  This is similar to <b>%a</b> except that "st", "nd",
              "rd" or "th" is added to the <u>day</u> as appropriate.

       <b>%v</b>     is replaced with "on <u>weekday,</u> <u>day-th</u> <u>month</u>"

       <b>%w</b>     is replaced with "<u>weekday</u>", the name of the day of the week.

       <b>%x</b>     is replaced with the <u>diff</u> between the current date and the trigger date.  The <u>diff</u> is  defined  as
              the  actual  number  of  days  between  these  two  dates;  <b>OMITs</b>  are  not counted.  (Strict date
              subtraction is performed.)

       <b>%y</b>     is replaced with "<u>year</u>", the year of the trigger date.

       <b>%z</b>     is replaced with "<u>yy</u>", the last two digits of the year.

       <b>%(</b><u>any_text</u><b>)</b>
              is replaced with the lookup of <u>any_text</u> in  the  translation  table.   It  is  the  equivalent  of
              [_("any_text")] but is more convenient to type.

       <b>%&lt;</b><u>any_text</u><b>&gt;</b>
              is replaced with the INFO value associated with the header <u>any_text</u> or the empty string if no such
              INFO value exists.  It is the equivalent of [triginfo("any_text")] but is more convenient to type.

       <b>%_</b>     (percent-underscore)  is  replaced  with  a  newline.   You  can  use  this  to achieve multi-line
              reminders.  Note that calendar back-ends vary in how they handle multi-line reminders:

              <b>o</b>      Running <b>remind</b> <b>-c</b> preserves newlines in the terminal calendar output.

              <b>o</b>      <b>rem2pdf</b> preserves newlines if <b>remind</b> is invoked with the <b>-pp</b> or <b>-ppp</b> option.

              <b>o</b>      <b>rem2html</b> preserves newlines if <b>remind</b> is invoked with the <b>-pp</b> option.

              <b>o</b>      <b>tkremind</b> preserves newlines.

              <b>o</b>      <b>rem2ps</b> converts newlines to spaces.  But <b>rem2ps</b> is deprecated; use <b>rem2pdf</b> instead.

              <b>o</b>      The "simple calendar" formats (ie, <b>remind</b>'s <b>-s</b>, <b>-n</b> and  <b>-p</b>  options)  convert  newlines  to
                     spaces.

              All  calendar  back-ends  collapse  multiple  spaces  to a single space and multiple newlines to a
              single newline.

       <b>%1</b>     is replaced with "now", "<u>m</u> minutes from now", "<u>m</u> minutes ago", "<u>h</u> hours from now", "<u>h</u> hours  ago",
              "<u>h</u>  hours  and  <u>m</u>  minutes  from  now"  or "<u>h</u> hours and <u>m</u> minutes ago", as appropriate for a timed
              reminder.  Note that unless you specify the <b>-a</b> option, timed  reminders  will  be  triggered  like
              normal  reminders,  and  thus  a timed reminder that occurred earlier in the day may be triggered.
              This causes the need for the "...ago" forms.

       <b>%2</b>     is replaced with "at <u>hh</u>:<u>mm</u>am" or "..pm" depending on the <b>AT</b> time of the reminder.

       <b>%3</b>     is replaced with "at <u>hh</u>:<u>mm</u>" in 24-hour format.

       <b>%4</b>     is replaced with "<u>mm</u>" where <u>mm</u> is the number of minutes between "now" and the  time  specified  by
              <b>AT</b>.  If the <b>AT</b> time is earlier than the current time, then the result is negative.

       <b>%5</b>     is replaced with "<u>ma</u>" where <u>ma</u> is the absolute value of the number produced by <b>%4</b>.

       <b>%6</b>     is  replaced  with  "ago" or "from now", depending on the relationship between the <b>AT</b> time and the
              current time.

       <b>%7</b>     is replaced with the number of hours between the <b>AT</b> time and the current time.  It is always  non-
              negative.

       <b>%8</b>     is  replaced  with the number of minutes between the <b>AT</b> time and the current time, after the hours
              (<b>%7</b>) have been subtracted out.  This is a number ranging from 0 to 59.

       <b>%9</b>     is replaced with "s" if the value produced by <b>%8</b> is not 1.

       <b>%0</b>     is replaced with "s" if the value produced by <b>%7</b> is not 1.

       <b>%!</b>     is replaced with "is" if the current time is before the <b>AT</b> time, or "was" if it is after.

       <b>%@</b>     is similar to <b>%2</b> but displays the current time.

       <b>%#</b>     is similar to <b>%3</b> but displays the current time.

       <b>%"</b>     (percent-doublequote - ") is removed.  This sequence is not used by the substitution  filter,  but
              is  used  to tell <b>Remind</b> which text to include in a calendar entry when the <b>-c</b>, <b>-s</b> or <b>-p</b> option is
              chosen.  See "CALENDAR MODE"

       Notes:

       o      <b>Remind</b> normally prints a blank line after each reminder; if the last character of the body is "%",
              the blank line will not be printed.  You can globally suppress the extra blank  lines  by  setting
              <b>$AddBlankLines</b> to 0.

       o      Substitutions  a,  b,  c,  e,  f,  g,  h, i, j, k, l, u and v all are replaced with "today" if the
              current date equals the trigger date, or "tomorrow" if the trigger  date  is  one  day  after  the
              current date.  Thus, they are <b>not</b> the same as substitutions built up from the simpler %w, %y, etc.
              sequences.

       o      The a, c, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, u, v, 2, and 3 substitutions may be preceded by an asterisk (for
              example,  %*c) which causes the word "at" or "on" that would normally be included in the output to
              be omitted.

       o      Any of the substitutions dealing with time (0 through 9 and '!')   produce  undefined  results  if
              used  in  a reminder that does not have an <b>AT</b> keyword.  Also, if a reminder has a <u>delta</u> and may be
              triggered on several days, the time substitutions ignore the date.  Thus, the <b>%1</b> substitution  may
              report  that  a  meeting is in 15 minutes, for example, even though it may only be in 2 days time,
              because a <u>delta</u> has triggered the reminder.  It is recommended that you use the time substitutions
              only in timed reminders with no <u>delta</u> that are designed to be queued for timed activation.

       o      Capital letters can be used in the substitution sequence, in which case the first character of the
              substituted string is capitalized (if it is normally a lower-case letter.)

       o      All other characters following a "%" sign are simply copied.  In particular, to  get  a  "%"  sign
              out,  use  "%%" in the body.  To start the body of a reminder with a space, use "% ", since <b>Remind</b>
              normally scans for the first non-space character after a <b>MSG,</b> <b>CAL</b> or <b>RUN</b> token.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>OMIT</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to being a keyword in the <b>REM</b> command, <b>OMIT</b> is a command in its own right.  Its syntax is:

              <b>OMIT</b> <u>weekday</u> [<u>weekday</u>...]

              or:

              <b>OMIT</b> [<u>day</u>] <u>month</u> [<u>year</u>]

              or:

              <b>OMIT</b> [<u>day1</u>] <u>month1</u> [<u>year1</u>] <b>THROUGH</b> [<u>day2</u>] <u>month2</u> [<u>year2</u>]

       The <b>OMIT</b> command is used to "globally" omit certain days (usually holidays).  These globally-omitted days
       are skipped by the "-" and "+" forms of <u>back</u> and <u>delta</u>, but  not  by  the  "--"  and  "++"  forms.   Some
       examples:

           OMIT Saturday Sunday
           OMIT 1 Jan
           OMIT 7 Sep 1992
           OMIT 15 Jan THROUGH 14 Feb
           OMIT May     # Equivalent to OMIT May 1 THROUGH May 31
           OMIT 25 Dec THROUGH 4 Jan
           OMIT 2023-05-03 THROUGH 2023-05-12
           OMIT Jun THROUGH July  # Equivalent to OMIT Jun 1 THROUGH July 31

       The  first  example omits every Saturday and Sunday.  This is useful for reminders that shouldn't trigger
       on weekends.

       The second example specifies a holiday that occurs on the same date each year - New Year's Day.

       The third example specifies a holiday that changes each year - Labour Day.  For these types of  holidays,
       you must create an <b>OMIT</b> command for each year.  (Later, in the description of expressions and some of the
       more advanced features of <b>Remind</b>, you will see how to automate this for some cases.)

       As with the REM command, you can use shorthand specifiers for dates; the following are equivalent:

            OMIT 7 Sep 1992
            OMIT 1992-09-07

       For convenience, you can use a <u>delta</u> and <b>MSG</b> or <b>RUN</b> keyword in the <b>OMIT</b> command.  The following sequences
       are equivalent:

            OMIT 1 Jan
            REM 1 Jan +4 MSG New year's day is %b!

            and

            OMIT 1 Jan +4 MSG New year's day is %b!

       The <b>THROUGH</b> keyword lets you conveniently OMIT a range of days.  For example, the following sequences are
       equivalent:

            OMIT 3 Jan 2011
            OMIT 4 Jan 2011
            OMIT 5 Jan 2011

            and

            OMIT 3 Jan 2011 THROUGH 5 Jan 2011

       Note  that  <b>Remind</b>  has a compiled-in limit to the number of full OMITs.  If you omit a range of <u>N</u> fully-
       specified (ie, year included) days, then <u>N</u> full OMITs are used up.  Trying to omit a very large range may
       result in the error "Too many full OMITs"

       You can make a THROUGH <b>OMIT</b> do double-duty as a <b>REM</b> command as long as both dates are fully specified

            OMIT 6 Sep 2010 THROUGH 10 Sep 2010 MSG Vacation

       If you use a THROUGH clause, then either the year must be supplied before and after the  THROUGH,  or  it
       must be missing before and after the THROUGH.  The following are legal:

           OMIT 25 Dec THROUGH 6 Jan
           OMIT 25 Dec 2024 THROUGH 6 Jan 2025

       But the following are not:

           OMIT 25 Dec THROUGH 6 Jan 2025
           OMIT 25 Dec 2024 THROUGH 6 Jan

       You can debug your global OMITs with the following command:

            OMIT DUMP

       The OMIT DUMP command prints the current global omits to standard output.

       <b>THE</b> <b>BEFORE,</b> <b>AFTER</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SKIP</b> <b>KEYWORDS</b>

       Normally,  days that are omitted, whether by a global <b>OMIT</b> command or the local <b>OMIT</b> or <b>OMITFUNC</b> keywords
       in a <b>REM</b> statement, only affect the counting of the -<u>back</u> or the +<u>delta</u>.  For example, suppose you have a
       meeting every Wednesday.  Suppose, too, that you have indicated 11 Nov as a holiday:

            OMIT 11 Nov +4 MSG Remembrance Day
            REM Wed +1 MSG Code meeting %b.

       The above sequence will issue a reminder about a meeting for 11 November  1992,  which  is  a  Wednesday.
       This is probably incorrect.  There are three options:

       <b>BEFORE</b> This  keyword  moves  the reminder to before any omitted days.  Thus, in the above example, use of
              <b>BEFORE</b> would cause the meeting reminder to be triggered on Tuesday, 10 November 1992.

       <b>AFTER</b>  This keyword moves the reminder to after any omitted days.  In  the  above  example,  the  meeting
              reminder would be triggered on Thursday, 12 November 1992.

       <b>SKIP</b>   This keyword causes the reminder to be skipped completely on any omitted days.  Thus, in the above
              example,  the reminder would not be triggered on 11 November 1992.  However, it would be triggered
              as usual on the following Wednesday, 18 November 1992.

       The <b>BEFORE</b> and <b>AFTER</b> keywords move the trigger date of a reminder to before or after a block  of  omitted
       days,  respectively.   Suppose  you normally run a backup on the first day of the month.  However, if the
       first day of the month is a weekend or holiday, you run the backup on the first working day following the
       weekend or holiday.  You could use:

            REM 1 OMIT Sat Sun AFTER RUN do_backup

       Let's examine how the trigger date is computed.  The <b>1</b> specifies the first day of the month.   The  local
       <b>OMIT</b>  keyword  causes  the  <b>AFTER</b> keyword to move the reminder forward past weekends.  Finally, the <b>AFTER</b>
       keyword will keep moving the reminder forward until it has passed any holidays specified with global <b>OMIT</b>
       commands.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>DO,</b> <b>INCLUDE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SYSINCLUDE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Remind</b> allows you to include other files in your reminder script, similar to the C preprocessor  #include
       directive.  For example, you might organize different reminders into different files like this:

               INCLUDE holidays.rem
               INCLUDE birthdays.rem
               INCLUDE "quote files with spaces.rem"

       <b>INCLUDE</b>  files  can  be  nested  up to a depth of 8.  As shown above, if a filename has spaces in it (not
       recommended!) you can use double-quotes around the filename.

       If you specify a filename of "-" in the <b>INCLUDE</b> command, <b>Remind</b> will begin reading from standard input.

       If you specify a <u>directory</u> as the argument to <b>INCLUDE</b>, then  <b>Remind</b>  will  process  all  files  (but  not
       subdirectories!)  in  that  directory  that  match the shell pattern "*.rem".  The files are processed in
       sorted order; the sort order matches that used by the shell when it expands "*.rem".

       Note that the file specified by an <b>INCLUDE</b>  command  is  interpreted  relative  to  the  <u>current</u>  <u>working</u>
       <u>directory</u>  <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Remind</u> <u>process</u>.  If you want to include a file relative to the directory containing the
       currently-processing   file,   use   <b>DO</b>   instead.    For   example,   if    the    current    file    is
       <b>/home/user/.reminders/foo.rem</b> and Remind's working directory is <b>/home/user</b>, then:

           # Read /home/user/.reminders/bar.rem
           DO bar.rem

           # Read /usr/share/bar.rem - absolute path
           DO /usr/share/bar.rem

           # Read /home/user/bar.rem
           INCLUDE bar.rem

           # Read /usr/share/bar.rem - absolute path
           INCLUDE /usr/share/bar.rem

       Arguably,  the  <b>INCLUDE</b>  command should have worked the way <b>DO</b> does right from the start, but changing it
       would have broken backward-compatibility, hence the introduction of <b>DO</b>.

       Note that if the currently-processing reminders file was specified as a symbolic link to a file  that  is
       not  in  the  same directory as the symbolic link itself, <b>DO</b> will fail.  <b>Remind</b> does <u>not</u> resolve the real
       path of symbolic links, so you should avoid using symbolic links to files.

       The <b>SYSINCLUDE</b> command is similar to <b>DO</b>, but it looks for relative pathnames under the  system  directory
       containing   standard   reminder   scripts.   For  this  version  of  <b>Remind</b>,  the  system  directory  is
       "/usr/share/remind".

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>RUN</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       If you include other files in your reminder script, you may not always entirely trust the contents of the
       other files.  For example, they may contain <b>RUN</b>-type reminders that could be used to access your files or
       perform undesired actions.  The <b>RUN</b> command can restrict this:  If you include the  command  <b>RUN</b>  <b>OFF</b>  in
       your  top-level  reminder script, any reminder or expression that would normally execute a system command
       is disabled.  <b>RUN</b> <b>ON</b> will re-enable the execution of system commands.  Note that the <b>RUN</b> <b>ON</b>  command  can
       <u>only</u>  be  used  in  your top-level reminder script; it will <u>not</u> work in any files accessed by the <b>INCLUDE</b>
       command.  This is to protect you from someone placing a <b>RUN</b> <b>ON</b> command in an included file.  However, the
       <b>RUN</b> <b>OFF</b> command can be used at top level or in an included file.

       If you run <b>Remind</b> with the <b>-r</b> command-line option, <b>RUN</b>-type reminders and the <b>shell()</b>  function  will  be
       disabled,  regardless of any <b>RUN</b> commands in the reminder script.  However, any command supplied with the
       <b>-k</b> option will still be executed.

       In addition, <b>Remind</b> contains a few other security features.  It will not read a file that  is  group-  or
       world-writable.   It will not run set-uid.  If it reads a file you don't own, it will disable RUN and the
       shell() function.  And if it is run as <u>root</u>, it will only read files owned by <u>root</u>.

       Note that if <b>Remind</b> reads standard input, it does <u>not</u> attempt to check the ownership of  standard  input,
       even if it is coming from a file, and hence does <u>not</u> disable RUN and shell() in this situation.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>EXPR</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Remind</b> lets you completely disable expression evaluation.  This could be useful if you are running Remind
       on  a  somewhat-untrustworthy  file  that  is not expected to contain expressions.  To disable expression
       evaluation, use:

               EXPR OFF

       If <b>Remind</b> encounters an expression while EXPR OFF is in effect, it returns an error

       To re-enable expression evaluation, use:

               EXPR ON

       As with <b>RUN</b> <b>ON,</b> <b>EXPR</b> <b>ON</b> can be used only in the top-level script, not in an included file.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>INCLUDECMD</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Remind</b> allows you to execute a shell command and evaluate the output of that command as  if  it  were  an
       included  file.   For  example, you could have scripts that extract reminders out of a database and print
       them on stdout as REM commands.  Here is an example:

            INCLUDECMD extract_reminders_for dfs

       We assume that the command "extract_reminders_for" extracts reminders out of a central database  for  the
       named  user.   Another use-case of INCLUDECMD is if you have your reminders stored in a file in some non-
       Remind format; you can write a command that  transforms  them  to  Remind  format  and  then  Remind  can
       "include" the file with an appropriate INCLUDECMD command.

       Note that if RUN is disabled, then INCLUDECMD will fail with the error message "RUN disabled"

       INCLUDECMD  passes  the  rest of the line to <b><a href="../man3/popen.3.html">popen</a></b>(3), meaning that the command is executed by the shell.
       As such, shell meta-characters may need escaping or arguments quoting, depending on what you're trying to
       do.  Remind itself does not perform any modification of the command line (apart from  the  normal  [expr]
       expression-pasting mechanism).

       If the command passed to INCLUDECMD begins with an exclamation mark "!", then Remind disables <b>RUN</b> for the
       output  of  the  command.   If  you  are running a command whose output you don't quite trust, you should
       prefix it with "!" so that any RUN commands it emits fail.

       An <b>INCLUDECMD</b> command counts towards the INCLUDE nesting depth.   For  any  given  Remind  run,  a  given
       INCLUDECMD  command  is  only  executed  once and the results are cached.  For example, if you generate a
       calendar, each unique INCLUDECMD command is run just  once,  not  once  for  each  day  of  the  produced
       calendar.   "Uniqueness"  is determined by looking at the command that will be passed to the shell, so if
       (for example) your INCLUDECMD uses expression-pasting that results in differences depending on the  value
       of <b>today()</b>, then each <u>unique</u> version of the command will be executed once.

       If a given reminder file contains more than one identical <b>INCLUDECMD</b>, only the first one will actually be
       executed.  All subsequent identical ones will use the cached output from the first one.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>BANNER</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       When <b>Remind</b> first issues a reminder, it prints a message like this:

            Reminders for Friday, 30th October, 1992 (today):

       (The  banner  is  not  printed  if  any of the calendar-producing options is used, or if the <b>-k</b> option is
       used.)

       The <b>BANNER</b> command lets you change the format.  It should appear before any <b>REM</b> commands.  The format is:

              <b>BANNER</b> <u>format</u>

       The <u>format</u> is similar to the <u>body</u> of a <b>REM</b> command.  It is passed through the substitution  filter,  with
       an implicit trigger of the current system date.  Thus, the default banner is equivalent to:

            BANNER Reminders for %w, %d%s %m, %y%o:

       You can disable the banner completely with BANNER %.  Or you can create a custom banner:

            BANNER Hi - here are your reminders for %y-%t-%r:

</pre><h4><b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>OMIT</b> <b>CONTEXT</b></h4><pre>
       Sometimes,  it is necessary to temporarily change the global <b>OMITs</b> that are in force for a few reminders.
       Three commands allow you to do this:

       <b>PUSH-OMIT-CONTEXT</b>
              This command saves the current global <b>OMITs</b> on an internal stack.

       <b>CLEAR-OMIT-CONTEXT</b>
              This command clears all of the global <b>OMITs</b>, starting you off with a "clean slate."

       <b>POP-OMIT-CONTEXT</b>
              This command restores the global <b>OMITs</b> that were saved by the most recent <b>PUSH-OMIT-CONTEXT</b>.

       For example, suppose you have a block of reminders that require a clear <b>OMIT</b> context, and that they  also
       introduce  unwanted  global <b>OMITs</b> that could interfere with later reminders.  You could use the following
       fragment:

            PUSH-OMIT-CONTEXT   # Save the current context
            CLEAR-OMIT-CONTEXT  # Clean the slate
            # Block of reminders goes here
            POP-OMIT-CONTEXT    # Restore the saved omit context

</pre><h4><b>EXPRESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In certain contexts, to be described later,  <b>Remind</b>  will  accept  expressions  for  evaluation.   <b>Remind</b>
       expressions resemble C expressions, but operate on different types of objects.

       <b>DATA</b> <b>TYPES</b>

       <b>Remind</b> expressions operate on five types of objects:

       <b>INT</b>    The  <b>INT</b>  data type consists of the integers representable in one machine word.  The <b>INT</b> data type
              corresponds to the C "int" type.

       <b>STRING</b> The <b>STRING</b> data type consists of strings  of  characters.   It  is  somewhat  comparable  to  a  C
              character array, but more closely resembles the string type in BASIC.

       <b>TIME</b>   The <b>TIME</b> data type is used for two different purposes:  To represent a time of day with one-minute
              precision  or  to  represent a duration with one-minute precision.  The context of where a <b>TIME</b> is
              used determines whether it is interpreted as a time of day or a duration.

              In contexts where a <b>TIME</b> represents a time of day, it may range from 00:00 to 23:59 and is  stored
              internally as an integer from 0 to 1439 representing the number of minutes since midnight.

              In  contexts  where  a  <b>TIME</b>  represents a duration, there is no upper limit on the hour component
              (beyond that imposed by the restriction that a duration expressed in minutes  must  fit  into  the
              signed  integer  type  of  your CPU architecture.)  Internally, a duration is stored as an integer
              number of minutes.

       <b>DATE</b>   The <b>DATE</b> data type consists of dates (later than 1 January 1990.)  Internally,  <b>DATE</b>  objects  are
              stored as the number of days since 1 January 1990.

       <b>DATETIME</b>
              The  <b>DATETIME</b>  data  type  consists of a date and time together.  Internally, <b>DATETIME</b> objects are
              stored as the number of minutes since midnight, 1 January 1990.   You  can  think  of  a  <b>DATETIME</b>
              object as being the combination of <b>DATE</b> and <b>TIME</b> parts.

       <b>CONSTANTS</b>

       The following examples illustrate constants in <b>Remind</b> expressions:

       <b>INT</b> <b>constants</b>
              12, 36, -10, 0, 1209

       <b>STRING</b> <b>constants</b>
              "Hello there", "This is a test", "\nHello\tThere", ""

              Note that the empty string is represented by "".  Remind supports the escape sequences "\a", "\b",
              "\f",  "\n", "\r", "\t" and "\v" which have the same meanings as their counterparts in C.  It also
              supports "\xAB" where A and B are hexadecimal digits; this operates just as in C.  The  "\x"  must
              be followed by one or two hex digits; the escape sequence "\x00" is not permitted.

              To include a quote in a string, use "\"".  Any other character preceded by a backslash is inserted
              into  the  string as-is, but the backslash itself is removed.  To include a backslash in a string,
              use "\\".

       <b>TIME</b> <b>constants</b>
              12:33, 0:01, 14:15, 16:42, 12.16, 13.00, 1.11, 4:30PM, 12:20am

              Note that <b>TIME</b> constants may be written in 24-hour format or in common "AM/PM" format.  If you use
              "AM/PM" format, then the hour can range from 1 to 12.  Either a period or colon  can  be  used  to
              separate  the  minutes  from the hours.  However, Remind will consistently output times in 24-hour
              format using only one separator character.  (The output separator character is chosen at  compile-
              time.)

              If the <b>TIME</b> is used where <b>Remind</b> expects a time-of-day (for example, in an <b>AT</b> clause), then it can
              be written in 24-hour format (ranging from 00:00 to 23:59) or 12-hour format (ranging from 12:00am
              to  11:59pm).   If  the <b>TIME</b> is used where <b>Remind</b> expects a duration, it must not have an <u>am</u> or <u>pm</u>
              suffix and the hour can be as large as you want, so long as the total number  of  minutes  in  the
              duration fits in a signed integer variable.

              For  convenience,  a  <b>TIME</b>  constant may be surrounded by single quotes to match <b>DATE</b> and <b>DATETIME</b>
              constants, but these quotes are optional.  That is, 12:56 and  '12:56'  represent  the  same  <b>TIME</b>
              constant.

       <b>DATE</b> <b>constants</b>
              <b>DATE</b>  constants  are  expressed  as  'yyyy/mm/dd'  or  'yyyy-mm-dd', and the single quotes <u>must</u> be
              supplied.  This distinguishes date constants from division or subtraction of integers.  Examples:

              '1993/02/22', '1992-12-25', '1999/01/01'

              Note that <b>DATE</b> values are <u>printed</u> without the quotes.  Although either '-' or '/' is accepted as a
              date separator on input, when dates are printed, only one will be used.  The choice of whether  to
              use  '-'  or '/' is made at compile-time.  Note also that versions of <b>Remind</b> prior to 03.00.01 did
              not support date constants.  In those versions, you must create dates using the  <b>date()</b>  function.
              Also, versions prior to 03.00.02 did not support the '-' date separator.

       <b>DATETIME</b> <b>constants</b>
              <b>DATETIME</b>  constants  are  expressed  similarly  to <b>DATE</b> constants with the addition of an "@HH:MM"
              part, optionally followed by "am" or "pm".  For example:

              '2008-04-05@23:11', '1999/02/03@14:06', '2001-04-07@08:30', '2020-01-01@3:20pm'

              <b>DATETIME</b> values are printed without the quotes.  Notes about date and  time  separator  characters
              for <b>DATE</b> and <b>TIME</b> constants apply also to <b>DATETIME</b> constants.

       <b>ZERO</b> <b>VALUES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TRUE/FALSE</b>

       All  types  have an associated <u>zero</u> <u>value</u>, which is treated as <u>false</u> by the IF command, the IIF function,
       and the logical operators.  The zero values are:

              <b>INT</b> - 0

              <b>DATE</b> - '1990-01-01'

              <b>TIME</b> - 00:00

              <b>DATETIME</b> - '1990-01-01@00:00'

              <b>STRING</b> - "" (the empty string)

       Any value other than the <u>zero</u> <u>value</u> is treated as <u>true</u>.

       <b>OPERATORS</b>

       <b>Remind</b> has the following operators.  Operators on the same line have equal precedence, while operators on
       lower lines have lower precedence than those on higher lines.  The operators approximately correspond  to
       C operators.

            !  -            (unary logical negation and arithmetic negation)
            *  /  %         (multiplication, division, modulus)
            +  -            (addition/concatenation, subtraction)
            &lt;  &lt;=  &gt;  &gt;=    (comparisons)
            ==  !=          (equality and inequality tests)
            &amp;&amp;              (logical AND)
            ||              (logical OR)

       <b>DESCRIPTION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>OPERATORS</b>

       <b>!</b>      Logical negation.  Can be applied to any type.  If the operand is non-zero, returns 0.  Otherwise,
              returns 1.

       <b>-</b>      Unary minus.  Can be applied to an <b>INT</b>.  Returns the negative of the operand.

       <b>*</b>      Multiplication.   Returns the product of two <b>INT</b>s.  Alternatively, if one argument is a <b>STRING</b> and
              the other an <b>INT</b>, returns a <b>STRING</b> consisting of the INT number of repeats of the original STRING.
              In this case, the INT argument cannot be negative.

       <b>/</b>      Integer division.  Returns the quotient of two <b>INT</b>s, discarding the remainder.

       <b>%</b>      Modulus.  Returns the remainder upon dividing one <b>INT</b> by another.

       <b>+</b>      Has several uses.  These are:

              <b>INT</b> + <b>INT</b> - returns the sum of two <b>INT</b>s.

              <b>INT</b> + <b>TIME</b> or <b>TIME</b> + <b>INT</b> - returns a <b>TIME</b> obtained by adding <b>INT</b> minutes  to  the  original  <b>TIME</b>.
              The result will always range from 00:00 through 23:59.

              <b>TIME</b>  + <b>TIME</b> treats the second <b>TIME</b> parameter as a duration, converting it to an integer number of
              minutes past midnight, and then performs addition as with <b>TIME</b> + <b>INT</b>.

              <b>INT</b> + <b>DATE</b> or <b>DATE</b> + <b>INT</b> - returns a <b>DATE</b> obtained by adding <b>INT</b> days to the original <b>DATE</b>.

              <b>INT</b> + <b>DATETIME</b> or <b>DATETIME</b> + <b>INT</b> - returns a <b>DATETIME</b>  obtained  by  adding  <b>INT</b>  minutes  to  the
              original <b>DATETIME</b>.

              <b>DATETIME</b>  +  <b>TIME</b>  or <b>TIME</b> + <b>DATETIME</b> treats the <b>TIME</b> parameter as a duration, converting it to an
              integer number of minutes past midnight, and then performs addition as with <b>DATETIME</b> + <b>INT</b>.

              <b>STRING</b> + <b>STRING</b> - returns a <b>STRING</b> that is the concatenation of the two original <b>STRING</b>s.

              <b>STRING</b> + anything or anything + <b>STRING</b> - converts the non-<b>STRING</b> argument to a  <b>STRING</b>,  and  then
              performs concatenation.  See the <b>coerce()</b> function.

       <b>-</b>      Has several uses.  These are:

              <b>INT</b> - <b>INT</b> - returns the difference of two <b>INT</b>s.

              <b>DATE</b> - <b>DATE</b> - returns (as an <b>INT</b>) the difference in days between two <b>DATE</b>s.

              <b>TIME</b> - <b>TIME</b> - returns (as an <b>INT</b>) the difference in minutes between two <b>TIME</b>s.

              <b>DATETIME</b> - <b>DATETIME</b> - returns (as an <b>INT</b>) the difference in minutes between two <b>DATETIME</b>s.

              <b>DATE</b> - <b>INT</b> - returns a <b>DATE</b> that is <b>INT</b> days earlier than the original <b>DATE</b>.

              <b>TIME</b> - <b>INT</b> - returns a <b>TIME</b> that is <b>INT</b> minutes earlier than the original <b>TIME</b>.

              <b>DATETIME</b> - <b>INT</b> - returns a <b>DATETIME</b> that is <b>INT</b> minutes earlier than the original <b>DATETIME</b>.

              <b>DATETIME</b> - <b>TIME</b> - coerces the <b>TIME</b> to an <b>INT</b> and then performs subtraction as above.

       <b>&lt;,</b> <b>&lt;=,</b> <b>&gt;,</b> <b>and</b> <b>&gt;=</b>
              These are the comparison operators.  They can take operands of any type, but both operands must be
              of  the  same  type.   The  comparison operators return 1 if the comparison is true, or 0 if it is
              false.  Note that string comparison is done following the lexical ordering of characters  on  your
              system, and that upper and lower case <u>are</u> distinct for these operators.

       <b>==,</b> <b>!=</b> == tests for equality, returning 1 if its operands are equal, and 0 if they are not.  != tests for
              inequality.

              If  the  operands  are  not  of  the  same  type,  ==  returns  0 and != returns 1.  Again, string
              comparisons are case-sensitive.

       <b>&amp;&amp;</b>     This is the logical AND operator.  Returns the second  operand  if  both  operands  are  non-zero.
              Otherwise,  returns whichever operand is zero.  Operands can be any type and "zero" is interpreted
              as appropriate for each operand's type.

       <b>||</b>     This is the logical OR operator.  It returns the first operand that is non-zero; if both  operands
              are  zero, then returns the second operand.  Operands can be any type and "zero" is interpreted as
              appropriate for each operand's type.

       <b>NOTES</b>

       If the result of an addition, subtraction or multiplication operation would not fit in a  C  "int"  type,
       <b>Remind</b>  issues  a  "Number  too high" error.  Unlike C, integer operations will not simply give the wrong
       answer in case of overflow.

       Operators of equal precedence are <u>always</u> evaluated from left to right, except where  parentheses  dictate
       otherwise.   This  is  important,  because the enhanced "+" operator is not necessarily associative.  For
       example:

            1 + 2 + "string" + 3 + 4  yields "3string34"
            1 + (2 + "string") + (3 + 4)  yields "12string7"
            12:59 + 1 + "test"  yields "13:00test"
            12:59 + (1 + "test")  yields "12:591test"

       The logical operators are so-called short-circuit operators, as they are in C.  This means  that  if  the
       first  operand  of || is true, then the second operand is <u>not</u> evaluated.  Similarly, if the first operand
       of &amp;&amp; is false, then the second operand is <u>not</u> evaluated.

       <b>VARIABLES</b>

       <b>Remind</b> allows you to assign values to variables.  The <b>SET</b> command is used as follows:

       <b>SET</b> <u>var</u> <u>expr</u>

       <u>Var</u> is the name of a variable.  It must start with a letter or underscore, and consist only  of  letters,
       digits and underscores.  Only the first 64 characters of a variable name are significant.  Variable names
       are <u>not</u> case sensitive; thus, "Afoo" and "afOo" are the same variable.  Examples:

            SET a 10 + (9*8)
            SET b "This is a test"
            SET mydir getenv("HOME")
            SET time 12:15
            SET date today()

       Note that variables themselves have no type.  They take on the type of whatever you store in them.

       Variables set with SET or on the command-line with <b>-i</b><u>var</u><b>=</b><u>expr</u> have global scope.

       To delete a variable, use the <b>UNSET</b> command:

       <b>UNSET</b> <u>var</u> [<u>var</u>...]

       For example, to delete all the variables declared above, use:

            UNSET a b mydir time date

       <b>SYSTEM</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>

       In  addition  to the regular user variables, <b>Remind</b> has several "system variables" that are used to query
       or control the operating state of <b>Remind</b>.  System variables are available starting from version  03.00.07
       of <b>Remind</b>.

       All system variables begin with a dollar sign '$'.  They can be used in <b>SET</b> commands and expressions just
       as  regular  variables  can.   All system variables always hold values of a specified type.  In addition,
       some system variables cannot be modified, and you cannot create new system variables.   System  variables
       can be initialized on the command line with the <b>-i</b> option, but you may need to quote them to avoid having
       the shell interpret the dollar sign.  System variable names are not case-sensitive.

       The  following  system  variables  are  defined.  Those marked "read-only" cannot be changed with the <b>SET</b>
       command.  All system variables hold values of type <b>INT</b>, unless otherwise specified.

       <b>$AddBlankLines</b>
              If set to 1 (the default), then <b>Remind</b> normally prints a blank line  after  the  banner  and  each
              reminder.   (This  can be suppressed by ending the reminder or banner with a single percent sign.)
              If $AddBlankLines is set to 0, then Remind does not print the blank line.  In this case, ending  a
              reminder  with  %  has no effect.  If you <u>do</u> want a blank line after a reminder, end it with <b>%_</b> to
              insert a newline.

       <b>$CalcUTC</b>
              If 1 (the default), then <b>Remind</b> uses C library  functions  to  calculate  the  number  of  minutes
              between  local  and Universal Time Coordinated.  This affects astronomical calculations (<b>sunrise()</b>
              for example.)  If 0, then you must supply the number of minutes between local and  Universal  Time
              Coordinated in the <b>$MinsFromUTC</b> system variable.

       <b>$CalMode</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              If non-zero, then the <b>-c</b> option was supplied on the command line.

       <b>$CalType</b> <b>(read-only,</b> <b>STRING</b> <b>type)</b>
              If  the  <b>-c</b>,  <b>-s</b> or <b>-p</b> command-line options were used, then this variable has the value "monthly".
              If <b>-c+</b>, <b>-s+</b> or <b>-p+</b> were used, then "weekly".  Otherwise, "none".

       <b>$Daemon</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              If "daemon mode" <b>-z</b> was invoked, contains the number of minutes between wakeups.  If  not  running
              in daemon mode, contains 0.  In server mode (either <b>-z0</b> or <b>-zj</b>), contains -1.

       <b>$DateSep</b> <b>(STRING</b> <b>type)</b>
              This  variable can be set only to "/" or "-".  It holds the character used to separate portions of
              a date when <b>Remind</b> prints a DATE or DATETIME value.

       <b>$DedupeReminders</b>
              If this variable is set to 1, then Remind will suppress duplicate reminders.  A given reminder  is
              considered  to  be  a  duplicate  of a previous one if it has the <u>exact</u> same trigger date, trigger
              time, and body.  By default, this variable is set to 0 and  Remind  does  not  suppress  duplicate
              reminders.

              As an example, consider the following reminder file:

                      SET $DedupeReminders 1
                      REM Wednesday MSG Phooey
                      REM 20 MSG Phooey

              On  Wednesday,  20 November 2024, only <u>one</u> "Phooey" will be issued.  In December of 2024, "Phooey"
              will be issued every Wednesday as well as on Friday, 20 December 2024

              If you set $DedupeReminders to 0, then <b>Remind</b> does not even track reminders to detect  duplicates.
              Consider the following example:

                      SET $DedupeReminders 0
                      REM Wednesday MSG Hello
                      SET $DedupeReminders 1
                      REM Wednesday MSG Hello

              Every Wednesday, <b>Remind</b> will issue <u>two</u> "Hello" reminders.
              Because $DedupeReminders was 0 when the first "Hello" was issued, it
              won't be tracked for potential duplicates.

              Duplicates are detected after all variable expansion and substitutions
              have been done.  Consider the following:

                      SET $DedupeReminders 1
                      set a "foo"
                      REM MSG [a]
                      set a "bar"
                      REM MSG [a]
                      set a "foo"
                      REM MSG [a]

              The first REM will trigger and print "foo".  The second will trigger and
              print "bar".  The third will not trigger because it's a duplicate of the
              first "foo".

       <b>$DefaultColor</b> <b>(STRING</b> <b>type)</b>
              This variable can be set to a string that has the form of three
              space-separated numbers.  Each number must be an integer from 0 to
              255, or all three numbers must be -1.  The default value of
              <b>$DefaultColor</b> is "-1 -1 -1", which suppresses default coloring
              of MSG-type reminders.  If you set <b>$DefaultColor</b> to any other
              value, then all MSG-, MSF- and CAL-type reminders are effectively
              converted into SPECIAL COLOR reminders whose color value is specified
              by <b>$DefaultColor</b>.

              Unlike other system variables, the value of <b>$DefaultColor</b> is
              <u>not</u> preserved between calendar iterations; rather, it is reset
              to "-1 -1 -1" at the start of each iteration.

       <b>$DefaultPrio</b>
              The default priority assigned to reminders without a <b>PRIORITY</b>
              clause.  You can set this as required to adjust the priorities of
              blocks of reminders without having to type priorities for individual
              reminders.  At startup, <b>$DefaultPrio</b> is set to 5000; it can range
              from 0 to 9999.

       <b>$DefaultDelta</b>
              You can set this variable to a number from 0 through 10000.  If set to
              a non-zero number, then <b>Remind</b> triggers any <b>REM</b> statement
              that lacks a delta as if it had a delta of <b>++$DefaultDelta</b>.
              By default, <b>$DefaultDelta</b> is zero.

       <b>$DefaultTDelta</b>
              The default time delta used if no +N is given in an AT clause.  This
              is normally 0, but can be set with the <b>-tt</b> option or explicitly
              set in your script.  If <b>$DefaultDelta</b> is non-zero, you can use an
              explicit delta of +0 in an AT clause to countermand the default delta.

       <b>$DeltaOverride</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              If non-zero, corresponds to the <u>n</u> argument given to a
              <b>-t</b><u>n</u> command-line option.

       <b>$DontFork</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              If non-zero, then the <b>-c</b> option was supplied on the command line.

       <b>$DontTrigAts</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              The number of times that the <b>-a</b> option was supplied on the
              command line.

       <b>$DontQueue</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              If non-zero, then the <b>-q</b> option was supplied on the command line.

       <b>$EndSent</b> <b>(STRING</b> <b>type)</b>
              Contains a list of characters that end a sentence.  The <b>MSF</b>
              keyword inserts two spaces after these characters.  Initially,
              <b>$EndSent</b> is set to ".!?" (period, exclamation mark, and
              question mark.)

       <b>$EndSentIg</b> <b>(STRING</b> <b>type)</b>
              Contains a list of characters that should be ignored when <b>MSF</b>
              decides whether or not to place two spaces after a sentence.  Initially,
              is set to "'&gt;)]}"+<a href="../man34/CHAR.34.html">CHAR</a>(34) (single-quote, greater-than, right
              parenthesis, right bracket, right brace, and double-quote.)

              For example, the default values work as follows:

                   MSF He said, "Huh! (Two spaces will follow this.)"  Yup.

              because the final parenthesis and quote are ignored (for the purposes of spacing) when they follow
              a period.

       <b>$ExpressionTimeLimit</b>
              If  set  to  a  non-zero value <u>n</u>, than any expression that takes longer than <u>n</u> seconds to evaluate
              will be aborted and an error returned.  This is to  prevent  maliciously-crafted  expressions  for
              creating  a denial-of-service.  In an included file, $ExpressionTimeLimit can only be lowered from
              its current value.  In the top-level file, it can be set to any value, including zero  to  disable
              the time limit.

       <b>$FirstIndent</b>
              The number of spaces by which to indent the first line of a <b>MSF</b>-type reminder.  The default is 0.

       <b>$FoldYear</b>
              The  standard  Unix  library functions may have difficulty dealing with dates later than 2037.  If
              this variable is set to 1, then the UTC calculations "fold back"  years  later  than  2037  before
              using the Unix library functions.  For example, to find out whether or not daylight saving time is
              in  effect in June, 2077, the year is "folded back" to 2010, because both years begin on a Monday,
              and both are non-leapyears.  The rules for daylight saving time are thus presumed to be  identical
              for  both  years, and the Unix library functions can handle 2010.  By default, this variable is 0.
              Set it to 1 if the sun or UTC functions misbehave for years greater than 2037.

       <b>$FormWidth</b>
              The maximum width of each line of text for formatting <b>MSF</b>-type  reminders.   The  default  is  the
              width  of  the  terminal in columns, minus 8, but clamped at a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 500.
              If standard output is not a terminal, then the default is 72.If an <b>MSF</b>-type  reminder  contains  a
              word too long to fit in this width, it will not be truncated - the width limit will be ignored.

       <b>$HushMode</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              If non-zero, then the <b>-h</b> option was supplied on the command line.

       <b>$IgnoreOnce</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              If  non-zero,  then the <b>-o</b> option was supplied on the command line, or implicitly enabled for some
              other reason.  In this case, <b>ONCE</b> directives will be ignored.

       <b>$InfDelta</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              If non-zero, then the <b>-t</b> option was supplied on the command line, with no <u>n</u> argument.

       <b>$IntMax</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              The largest representable <b>INT</b>.  On a machine with 32-bit  signed  integers  using  twos-complement
              representation, this will be 2147483647.

       <b>$IntMin</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              The  smallest  representable  <b>INT</b>.  On a machine with 32-bit signed integers using twos-complement
              representation, this will be -2147483648.

       <b>$Latitude</b> <b>(STRING</b> <b>type)</b>
              The latitude of your location, expressed as a string that is  a  floating-point  number.   Because
              <b>Remind</b>  does  not have a native floating-point type, we need to express it as a string.  $Latitude
              can range from "-90.0" to "90.0", with positive numbers representing points north of  the  equator
              and negative numbers representing south.  Note that regardless of your locale, $Latitude is always
              interpreted in the "C" locale and as such, the decimal point must be a period (".").

       <b>$Longitude</b> <b>(STRING</b> <b>type)</b>
              The  longitude  of  your location, expressed as a string that is a floating-point number.  Because
              <b>Remind</b> does not have a native floating-point type, we need to express it as a string.   $Longitude
              can  range  from  "-180.0"  to  "180.0",  with  positive  numbers  representing points east of the
              Greenwich Meridian and negative numbers representing west.  Note that regardless of  your  locale,
              $Longitude is always interpreted in the "C" locale and as such, the decimal point must be a period
              (".").

              For example, the coordinates of the Statue of Liberty in New York City are approximately set by:

                  SET $Latitude   "40.68933"
                  SET $Longitude "-74.04454"

       <b>$LatDeg,</b> <b>$LatMin,</b> <b>$LatSec</b> <b>(DEPRECATED)</b>
              These  specify  the  latitude  of your location.  <b>$LatDeg</b> can range from -90 to 90, and the others
              from -59 to 59.  Northern latitudes are  positive;  southern  ones  are  negative.   For  southern
              latitudes,  all  three  components  should be negative.  These three variables are deprecated; you
              should use <b>$Latitude</b> instead.

       <b>$Location</b> <b>(STRING</b> <b>type)</b>
              This is a string specifying the name of your location.  It is usually the name  of  your  town  or
              city.   It  can  be  set  to  whatever  you  like, but good style indicates that it should be kept
              consistent with the latitude and longitude system variables.

       <b>$LongDeg,</b> <b>$LongMin,</b> <b>$LongSec</b> <b>(DEPRECATED)</b>
              These specify the longitude of your location.  <b>$LongDeg</b> can  range  from  -180  to  180.   Western
              longitudes  are  positive;  eastern ones are negative.  Note that all three components should have
              the same sign: All positive for western longitudes and all negative for eastern longitudes.   Note
              that  for  historical  reasons, the sign for longitude is <u>different</u> from the usual convention!  If
              you find the longitude of your location from a search engine, you will most likely <u>need</u> <u>to</u>  <u>invert</u>
              <u>the</u>  <u>sign</u>  <u>to</u> <u>have</u> <u>it</u> <u>work</u> <u>correctly</u> <u>with</u> <u>Remind.</u> These three variables are deprecated; you should
              use <b>$Longitude</b> instead.  Note also that <b>$Longitude</b> uses the standard convention  of  negative  for
              western longitudes and positive for eastern ones.

              The  latitude  and  longitude  information  is  required for the functions <b>sunrise()</b> and <b>sunset()</b>.
              Default values can be compiled into <b>Remind</b>, or you can <b>SET</b> the correct values at the start of your
              reminder scripts.

              Note that setting any of <b>$LongDec</b>, <b>$LongMin</b> and <b>$LongSec</b> updates <b>$Longitude</b>  correspondingly,  and
              setting  <b>$Longitude</b>  updates  <b>$LongDeg</b>,  <b>$LongMin</b> and <b>$LongSec</b>.  Similar rules apply to <b>$Latitude</b>,
              <b>$LatDeg</b>, <b>$LatMin</b> and <b>$LatSec</b>.

       <b>$MaxLateMinutes</b>
              This variable controls how <b>Remind</b> reacts to a computer being suspended and then woken.   Normally,
              if  a  timed  reminder  is  queued and then the computer suspended, and then the computer is woken
              <u>after</u> the timed reminder's trigger time, <b>Remind</b> will trigger the timer anyway,  despite  the  fact
              that the trigger time has already passed.

              If  you set <b>$MaxLateMinutes</b> to a non-zero integer between 1 and 1440, then <b>Remind</b> will <u>not</u> trigger
              a timed reminder whose trigger time is more than <b>$MaxLateMinutes</b> minutes in the past.

              Note that <b>Remind</b> uses the value of <b>$MaxLateMinutes</b> that is in effect when it has finished  reading
              the  reminder  file  and puts itself in the background.  Generally, you should set <b>$MaxLateMinutes</b>
              once near the beginning of the file and not change it after that.

       <b>$MaxSatIter</b>
              The maximum number of iterations for the <b>SATISFY</b> clause (described later.)  Must be at least 10.

       <b>$MaxStringLen</b>
              A limit on the longest string that <b>Remind</b> will allow you to create.  The default is 65535.  If you
              set <b>$MaxStringLen</b> to 0 or to -1, then <b>remind</b> will allow you to create arbitrarily-long strings, at
              least until it runs out of memory.  We do not recommend setting <b>$MaxStringLen</b> to 0 or  -1  because
              it is very easy to write code that DOSes <b>Remind</b> in that case.

       <b>$MinsFromUTC</b>
              The number of minutes between Universal Time Coordinated and local time.  If <b>$CalcUTC</b> is non-zero,
              this is calculated upon startup of <b>Remind</b>.  Otherwise, you must set it explicitly.  If <b>$CalcUTC</b> is
              zero, then <b>$MinsFromUTC</b> is used in the astronomical calculations.  You must adjust it for daylight
              saving  time  yourself.   Also,  if  you want to initialize <b>$MinsFromUTC</b> using the <b>-i</b> command-line
              option, you must also set <b>$CalcUTC</b> to 0 with the <b>-i</b> option.

       <b>$NextMode</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              If non-zero, then the <b>-n</b> option was supplied on the command line.

       <b>$MaxFullOmits</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              The maximum number of full OMITs allowed (a compiled-in constant.)

       <b>$MaxPartialOmits</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              The maximum number of partial OMITs allowed (a compiled-in constant.)

       <b>$NumFullOmits</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              The number of full OMITs in the current OMIT context.

       <b>$NumPartialOmits</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              The number of partial OMITs in the current OMIT context.

       <b>$NumQueued</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              Contains the number of reminders queued so far for background timed triggering.

       <b>$NumTrig</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              Contains the number of reminders triggered for the current date.  One use for this variable is  as
              follows:   Suppose  you  wish  to  shade in the box of a PostScript calendar whenever a holiday is
              triggered.  You could save the value of <b>$NumTrig</b> in a regular variable prior to executing a  block
              of  holiday reminders.  If the value of <b>$NumTrig</b> after the holiday block is greater than the saved
              value, then at least one holiday was triggered, and you can execute the command to  shade  in  the
              calendar box.  (See the section "Calendar Mode".)

              Note that <b>$NumTrig</b> is affected <u>only</u> by <b>REM</b> commands; triggers in <b>IFTRIG</b> commands do not affect it.

       <b>$OnceFile</b> <b>(STRING</b> <b>type)</b>
              If  you  set  this  variable to a non-empty string, then rather than using the file access date to
              determine whether or not to run a ONCE-type reminder, <b>Remind</b> will maintain a timestamp in the file
              <b>$OnceFile</b>.  This is more reliable than using the access date of the reminder file.

              If <b>$OnceFile</b> does not exist, then it will be created the first time a <b>ONCE</b> keyword  is  processed.
              The  file must be writable by the current user.  If you try to set <b>$OnceFile</b> <u>after</u> a <b>ONCE</b> reminder
              has already been processed, <b>Remind</b> will issue a warning and ignore the attempt to set <b>$OnceFile</b>.

       <b>$ParseUntriggered</b>
              A flag indicating whether or not <b>Remind</b> should fully parse <b>REM</b> statements that are not  triggered.
              0 means to skip parsing them and 1 (the default) means to parse them.

              For example, if we have the following <b>REM</b> statement:

                          REM 2020-01-01 MSG ["bad_expression" * 2]

              Then  by  default,  <b>Remind</b> will fully parse the line and issue a "Type mismatch" error even if the
              reminder is not triggered.  However, if <b>$ParseUntriggered</b> is set to 0, then <b>Remind</b> will not  issue
              the error except on 2020-01-01, when the reminder is triggered.

              Setting  <b>$ParseUntriggered</b> to 0 may in some cases slightly improve performance, at the risk of not
              catching errors until a reminder is triggered.

       <b>$PrefixLineNo</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              If non-zero, then the <b>-l</b> option was supplied on the command line.

       <b>$PSCal</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              If non-zero, then the <b>-p</b> option was supplied on the command line.

       <b>$RunOff</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              If non-zero, the <b>RUN</b> directives are disabled.

       <b>$SimpleCal</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              Set to a non-zero value if <u>either</u> of the <b>-p</b> or <b>-s</b> command-line options was supplied.

       <b>$SortByDate</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              Set to 0 if no <b>-g</b> option is used, 1 if sorting by date in ascending order, or 2 if sorting by date
              in descending order.

       <b>$SortByPrio</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              Set to 0 if no <b>-g</b> option is used, 1 if sorting by priority in ascending order, or 2 if sorting  by
              priority in descending order.

       <b>$SortByTime</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              Set to 0 if no <b>-g</b> option is used, 1 if sorting by time in ascending order, or 2 if sorting by time
              in descending order.

       <b>$SubsIndent</b>
              The  number  of  spaces  by  which  all lines (except the first) of an <b>MSF</b>-type reminder should be
              indented.  The default is 0.

       <b>$SuppressImplicitWarnings</b>
              Normally, <b>Remind</b> issues a warning if a line begins with an unknown token and is treated as  a  <b>REM</b>
              command,  or  if  a  <b>REM</b> command is missing a type and is treated as a <b>MSG</b>-type reminder.  Setting
              <b>$SuppressImplicitWarnings</b> to 1 suppresses these  warnings.   The  default  is  0  and  we  do  not
              recommend disabling the warnings.

       <b>$SuppressLRM</b>
              Normally,  when  <b>Remind</b> is run with the <b>-c</b> option in a UTF-8 locale, it emits a left-to-right mark
              sequence after printing day names or reminders.  Some terminals render this  incorrectly,  so  you
              can use:

                  SET $SuppressLRM 1

              at  the top of your reminder file to suppress the LRM sequences, or you can invoke Remind with the
              option <b>'-i$SuppressLRM=1'</b>.

       <b>$SysInclude</b> <b>(read-only,</b> <b>STRING</b> <b>type)</b>
              A directory path containing standard reminder scripts.  Currently, Remind ships with some standard
              holiday files and language packs.   The  value  of  <b>$SysInclude</b>  is  "/usr/share/remind"  on  this
              installation.

       <b>$T</b> <b>(read-only,</b> <b>DATE</b> <b>type)</b>

       <b>$Tt</b> <b>(read-only,</b> <b>TIME</b> <b>type)</b>
              Equivalent to <b>trigtime()</b>.

       <b>$TimeSep</b> <b>(STRING</b> <b>type)</b>
              This  variable can be set only to ":" or ".".  It holds the character used to separate portions of
              a time when <b>Remind</b> prints a TIME or DATETIME value.

       <b>$UntimedFirst</b> <b>(read-only)</b>
              Set to 1 if the <b>-g</b> option is used with a fourth sort character of "d"; set to 0 otherwise.

       <b>$U</b> <b>(read-only,</b> <b>DATE</b> <b>type)</b>

              light with the <b>-@,1</b> option.)  The terminal background is considered to be "dark" if the average of
              the red, green and blue components is at most 85 out of 255, and if the maximum of  any  component
              is at most 128 out of 255.

       Note:   If  any of the calendar modes are in effect, then the values of $Daemon, $DontFork, $DontTrigAts,
       $DontQueue, $HushMode, $IgnoreOnce, $InfDelta, and $NextMode are not meaningful.

       <b>BUILT-IN</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b>

       <b>Remind</b> has a plethora of built-in functions.  The syntax for a function call is the same as in  C  -  the
       function name, followed a comma-separated list of arguments in parentheses.  Function names are not case-
       sensitive.   If  a  function  takes  no  arguments,  it  must  be  followed by "()" in the function call.
       Otherwise, <b>Remind</b> will interpret it as a variable name, and probably not work correctly.

       In the descriptions below, short forms are used to  denote  acceptable  types  for  the  arguments.   The
       characters  "i",  "s",  "d",  "t"  and  "q"  denote  <b>INT</b>,  <b>STRING</b>,  <b>DATE</b>,  <b>TIME</b>  and  <b>DATETIME</b> arguments,
       respectively.  If an argument can be one of several types, the characters are concatenated.  For example,
       "di_arg" denotes an argument that can be a <b>DATE</b> or an <b>INT</b>.  "x_arg" denotes an argument that  can  be  of
       any type.  The type of the argument is followed by an underscore and an identifier naming the argument.

       The built-in functions are:

       <b>_(s_message)</b>
              Returns  the  translation  table  entry for <u>message</u>.  If there is no such translation table entry,
              then returns <u>message</u> unmodified.  For example, consider this sequence:

                      TRANSLATE "Goodbye" "Tot ziens"
                      SET a _("Goodbye")

              After those two lines have been executed, the variable <b>a</b> will be set  to  "Tot  ziens".   See  the
              section THE TRANSLATION TABLE for more information.

              In  the  body  of  a  reminder,  the  substitution  sequence <b>%(</b><u>text</u><b>)</b> is (almost) the equivalent of
              <b>[_("</b><u>text</u><b>")]</b>.  Therefore, the following reminders are almost equivalent:

                      REM MSG %(Goodbye)
                      REM MSG [_("Goodbye")]

              The only difference is that if _("Goodbye") contains a <b>%</b>  sign,  then  that  result  will  be  run
              through  the substitution filter, whereas in the first reminder, it will not.  That is because the
              second <b>REM</b> command performs expression pasting followed by a substitution filter pass,  while  the
              first  one performs the translation as part of the substitution filter (and does not make a second
              substitution filter pass.)

       <b>abs(i_num)</b>
              Returns the absolute value of <u>num</u>.

       <b>access(s_file,</b> <b>si_mode)</b>
              Tests the access permissions for the file <u>file</u>.  <u>Mode</u> can be a string, containing  a  mix  of  the
              characters  "rwx"  for  read,  write and execute permission testing.  Alternatively, <u>mode</u> can be a
              number as described in the UNIX <b><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></b>(2) system call.  The function returns 0 if the file can  be
              accessed with the specified <u>mode</u>, and -1 otherwise.

       <b>adawn([dq_date])</b>
              Returns  the  time  of "astronomical dawn" on the specified <u>date</u>.  If <u>date</u> is omitted, defaults to
              <b>today()</b>.  If a <u>datetime</u> object is supplied, only the date component is used.

       <b>adusk([dq_date])</b>
              Returns the time of "astronomical twilight" on the specified <u>date</u>.  If <u>date</u> is  omitted,  defaults
              to <b>today()</b>.

       <b>ampm(tq_time</b> <b>[,s_am</b> <b>[,s_pm</b> <b>[,i_lz]]])</b>
              Returns  a  <b>STRING</b>  that  is  the  result of converting <u>time</u> (which is either a <b>TIME</b> or a <b>DATETIME</b>
              object) to "AM/PM" format.  The optional arguments <u>am</u> and <u>pm</u> are the strings to append in  the  AM
              and  PM  case,  respectively;  they  default to "AM" and "PM".  The optional argument <u>lz</u> specifies
              whether or not the hour should be padded to two digits with a leading zero.  If <u>lz</u> is zero, then a
              leading 0 is not added; otherwise, the hour is padded out to two digits with a leading  zero.   If
              not supplied, <u>lz</u> defaults to zero.

              The  function  obeys  the system variables $DateSep, $TimeSep and $DateTimeSep when formatting its
              output.  Here are some examples of its output:

                      ampm(0:22)                 returns "12:22AM"
                      ampm(17:45, "am", "pm")    returns "5:45pm"
                      ampm(17:45, "am", "pm", 1) returns "05:45pm"
                      ampm('2020-03-14@21:34')   returns "2020-03-14@9:34PM"

       <b>ansicolor(i_red,</b> <b>i_green,</b> <b>i_blue</b> <b>[,i_bg</b> <b>[,i_clamp]])</b>
              Returns a <b>STRING</b> that contains an ANSI escape sequence for changing the terminal text color.   The
              parameters  <u>red</u>,  <u>green</u> and <u>blue</u> are integers from 0 to 255 specifying the value of the respective
              color component.  As a special case, all three values can be -1, in which case the  ANSI  sequence
              "ESC[0m" is returned, which resets all text attributes to normal.

              The string returned by <b>ansicolor</b> depends on the color mode that <b>Remind</b> is running in, as specified
              by  the  <b>-@</b> option.  If color mode is not enabled, then <b>ansicolor</b> always returns the empty string.
              Otherwise, it returns the escape sequence that best approximates the color  according  to  the  <b>-@</b>
              color mode.

              The  optional <u>bg</u> argument is either 0 or 1.  If 0 (the default), then the foreground color is set.
              If 1, then the background color is set.  Note that setting the  background  color  only  works  in
              256-color or true-color mode.

              The  optional  <u>clamp</u>  argument is either 0 or 1.  If 0 (the default), then colors are not adjusted
              based on the terminal background color.  If 1, then <b>Remind</b>  attempts  to  adjust  dark  or  bright
              colors so they have enough contrast to be visible in the terminal.

              The  first  three  arguments may alternatively be specified as a string consisting of three space-
              separated numbers, as in this example: "128 128 0"

              As a special case, <b>ansicolor("")</b>  is  equivalent  to  <b>ansicolor(-1,-1,-1)</b>  and  returns  the  ANSI
              sequence to reset all text attributes to normal.

              Note  that  inserting  ANSI  color  sequences  in  calendar  mode  <u>will</u>  <u>produce</u>  <u>garbled</u> <u>results</u>.
              Therefore, we recommend defining functions such as the ones below that return the empty string  in
              calendar mode:

                      IF $CalMode
                          FSET fg(r,g,b) ""
                          FSET bg(r,g,b) ""
                      ELSE
                          FSET fg(r,g,b) ansicolor(r,g,b)
                          FSET bg(r,g,b) ansicolor(r,g,b,1)
                      ENDIF
                      REM [fg(255,0,0)][bg(64,64,64)]Red on Gray[fg(-1,-1,-1)] in normal mode
                      REM SPECIAL COLOR 0 255 0 Green in normal and calendar mode

              If  you  use  the  <b>ansicolor</b>  function,  don't  forget  to  reset  the  color  back to normal with
              <b>ansicolor(-1,-1,-1)</b> or subsequent reminders will continue to be colored.

       <b>args(s_fname)</b>
              Returns the number of arguments expected by the user-defined function <u>fname</u>,  or  -1  if  no  such
              user-defined  function  exists.  Note that this function examines only user-defined functions, not
              built-in functions.  Its main use is  to  determine  whether  or  not  a  particular  user-defined
              function has been defined previously.  The <b>args()</b> function is available only in versions of <b>Remind</b>
              from 03.00.04 and up.

       <b>asc(s_string)</b>
              Returns  an  <b>INT</b>  that  is  the  ASCII  code of the first character in <u>string</u>.  As a special case,
              <b>asc("")</b> returns 0.  For UTF-8 strings, this will return the  UTF-8  byte  with  which  the  string
              begins,  which  is not likely to be very useful (and may indeed be negative on machines where <b>char</b>
              is a signed type.)

       <b>baseyr()</b>
              Returns the "base year" that was compiled into <b>Remind</b>  (normally  1990.)   All  dates  are  stored
              internally as the number of days since 1 January of <b>baseyr()</b>.

       <b>char(i_i1</b> <b>[,i_i2...])</b>
              This  function  can take any number of <b>INT</b> arguments.  It returns a <b>STRING</b> consisting of the bytes
              specified by the arguments.  It is easy to create invalid UTF-8 sequences; <b>char</b> does not check for
              this.  Note that none of the arguments can be 0, unless there is only one argument.  As a  special
              case, <b><a href="../man0/char.0.html">char</a>(0)</b> returns "".

       <b>choose(i_index,</b> <b>x_arg1</b> <b>[,x_arg2...])</b>
              <b>Choose</b>  must  take  at least two arguments, the first of which is an <b>INT</b>.  If <u>index</u> is <u>n</u>, then the
              <u>n</u>th subsequent argument is returned.  If <u>index</u> is less than 1, then <u>arg1</u> is returned.  If <u>index</u> is
              greater than the number of subsequent arguments, then the last argument is returned.  Examples:

                 <b>choose(0,</b> <b>"foo",</b> <b>1:13,</b> <b>1000)</b> returns "foo"
                 <b>choose(1,</b> <b>"foo",</b> <b>1:13,</b> <b>1000)</b> returns "foo"
                 <b>choose(2,</b> <b>"foo",</b> <b>1:13,</b> <b>1000)</b> returns 1:13
                 <b>choose(3,</b> <b>"foo",</b> <b>1:13,</b> <b>1000)</b> returns 1000
                 <b>choose(4,</b> <b>"foo",</b> <b>1:13,</b> <b>1000)</b> returns 1000

              Note that only the first argument and the chosen result are evaluated.  Any  non-chosen  arguments
              will not be evaluated.

       <b>coerce(s_type,</b> <b>x_arg)</b>
              This  function  converts  <u>arg</u> to the specified <u>type</u>, if such conversion is possible.  <u>Type</u> must be
              one of "INT", "STRING", "DATE", "TIME" or "DATETIME" (case-insensitive).  The conversion rules are
              as follows:

              If <u>arg</u> is already of the <u>type</u> specified, it is returned unchanged.

              If <u>type</u> is "STRING", then <u>arg</u> is converted to a string consisting of its printed representation.

              If <u>type</u> is "DATE", then an <b>INT</b> <u>arg</u> is converted by interpreting it as the number of days  since  1
              January  <b>baseyr()</b>.   A  <b>STRING</b>  <u>arg</u>  is converted by attempting to read it as if it were a printed
              date.  A <b>DATETIME</b> is converted to a date by dropping the time component.  A  <b>TIME</b>  <u>arg</u>  cannot  be
              converted to a date.

              If  <u>type</u> is "TIME", then an <b>INT</b> <u>arg</u> is converted by interpreting it as the number of minutes since
              midnight.  A <b>STRING</b> <u>arg</u> is converted by attempting to read it as if it were  a  printed  time.   A
              <b>DATETIME</b> is converted to a time by dropping the date component.  A <b>DATE</b> <u>arg</u> cannot be converted to
              a time.

              If  <u>type</u>  is  "DATETIME", then an <b>INT</b> <u>arg</u> is converted by interpreting it as the number of minutes
              since midnight, 1 January <b>baseyr()</b>.  A <b>STRING</b> is converted by attempting to read it as if it  were
              a printed datetime.  Other types cannot be converted to a datetime.

              If  <u>type</u>  is  "INT",  then  <b>DATE</b>,  <b>TIME</b>  and <b>DATETIME</b> arguments are converted using the reverse of
              procedures described above.  A <b>STRING</b> <u>arg</u> is converted by parsing it as an integer.

       <b>columns([s_arg])</b>
              If called with no arguments, <b>columns()</b> behaves as follows: If standard output is  a  TTY,  returns
              the  width  of  the  terminal  in  columns.   If  standard  output  is not a TTY, attempts to open
              "/dev/tty" to obtain the terminal size.  If this fails, returns -1.

              If called with a single string argument, <b>columns(str)</b> returns  the  number  of  columns  <b>str</b>  will
              occupy  if  printed to a terminal.  ANSI color-changing sequences occupy zero columns whereas some
              Unicode characters occupy two columns.  <b>columns(str)</b> takes all of that into account.  Note that if
              Remind was compiled without Unicode support, <b>columns(str)</b> returns a type mismatch error.

       <b>current()</b>
              Returns the current date and time as a DATETIME object.  This may be the actual date and time,  or
              may be the date and time supplied on the command line.

       <b>date(i_y,</b> <b>i_m,</b> <b>i_d)</b>
              The  <b>date()</b> function returns a <b>DATE</b> object with the year, month and day components specified by <u>y</u>,
              <u>m</u> and <u>d</u>.

       <b>datepart(dq_datetime)</b>
              Returns a <b>DATE</b> object representing the date portion of <u>datetime</u>.

       <b>datetime(args)</b>
              The <b>datetime()</b> function can take anywhere from  two  to  five  arguments.   It  always  returns  a
              DATETIME generated from its arguments.

              If you supply two arguments, the first must be a DATE and the second a TIME.

              If  you  supply  three  arguments, the first must be a DATE and the second and third must be INTs.
              The second and third arguments are interpreted as hours and minutes and converted to a TIME.

              If you supply four arguments, the first three must be INTs, interpreted as  the  year,  month  and
              day.  The fourth argument must be a TIME.

              Finally,  if  you supply five arguments, they must all be INTs and are interpreted as year, month,
              day, hour and minute.

       <b>dawn([dq_date])</b>
              Returns the time of "civil dawn" on the specified <u>date</u>.  If <u>date</u> is omitted, defaults to  <b>today()</b>.
              If a <u>datetime</u> object is supplied, only the date component is used.

       <b>day(dq_date)</b>
              This function takes a <b>DATE</b> or <b>DATETIME</b> as an argument, and returns an <b>INT</b> that is the day-of-month
              component of <u>date</u>.

       <b>daysinmon(i_m,</b> <b>i_y)</b>
              Returns the number of days in month <u>m</u> (1-12) of the year <u>y</u>.

       <b>defined(s_var)</b>
              Returns 1 if the variable named by <u>var</u> is defined, or 0 if it is not.
              Note that <b>defined()</b> takes a <b>STRING</b> argument; thus, to check if variable X is defined, use:

                        defined("X")

              and not:

                        defined(X)

              The  second example will attempt to evaluate X, and will return an error if it is undefined or not
              of type <b>STRING</b>.

       <b>dosubst(s_str</b> <b>[,d_date</b> <b>[,t_time]])</b> or <b>dosubst(s_str</b> <b>[,q_datetime])</b>
              Returns a <b>STRING</b> that is the result of passing  <u>str</u>  through  the  substitution  filter  described
              earlier.  The parameters <u>date</u> and <u>time</u> (or <u>datetime</u>) establish the effective trigger date and time
              used by the substitution filter.  If <u>date</u> and <u>time</u> are omitted, they default to <b>today()</b> and <b>now()</b>.

              Note  that  if  <u>str</u>  does  not  end  with "%", a newline character will be added to the end of the
              result.  Also, calling <b>dosubst()</b> with a <u>date</u> that is in the past (i.e., if <u>date</u>  &lt;  <b>today()</b>)  will
              produce undefined results.

              <b>Dosubst()</b> is only available starting from version 03.00.04 of <b>Remind</b>.

       <b>dusk([dq_date])</b>
              Returns  the  time  of  "civil  twilight"  on the specified <u>date</u>.  If <u>date</u> is omitted, defaults to
              <b>today()</b>.

       <b>easterdate([dqi_arg])</b>
              If <u>arg</u> is an <b>INT</b>, then returns the date of Easter Sunday for the specified year.  If <u>arg</u> is a <b>DATE</b>
              or <b>DATETIME</b>, then returns the date of the next Easter Sunday on or after <u>arg</u>.  (The time component
              of a datetime is ignored.)  If <u>arg</u> is omitted, then it defaults to <b>today()</b>.

              Note  that  <b>easterdate</b>  computes  the  Western  Easter.   For  the  Orthodox  Easter   date,   see
              <b>orthodoxeaster</b>.

       <b>escape(s_string</b> <b>[,i_add_quotes])</b>
              Returns  a  <b>STRING</b>  that  is  the  same  as  the  input  string,  but  with all special characters
              backslashed-escaped.  For example, the following command:

                      set a escape("foo" + <a href="../man10/char.10.html">char</a>(10) + "bar")

              will set a to "foo\nbar" where "\n" is the literal sequence "\" followed by "n".  This  is  useful
              if  you want to compute a string in a pasted-in expression that <b>Remind</b> will then parse as a quoted
              string again, such as in a TRANSLATE command or an INFO clause.

              If the optional <u>add_quotes</u> argument is supplied and is non-zero, then the return value from <b>escape</b>
              will include surrounding double-quotes.

       <b>evaltrig(s_trigger</b> <b>[,dq_start])</b>
              Evaluates <u>trigger</u> as if it were a REM or IFTRIG trigger specification and returns the trigger date
              as a <b>DATE</b> (or as a <b>DATETIME</b> if there is an <b>AT</b> clause.)  Returns a negative <b>INT</b> if no trigger could
              be computed.

              Normally, <b>evaltrig</b> finds a trigger date on or after today.  If you supply the <u>start</u> argument, then
              it scans starting from there.

              For example, the expression:

                evaltrig("Mon 1", '2008-10-07')

              returns '2008-11-03', since that is the first date on or after 7 October 2008 that satisfies  "Mon
              1".

              If  you want to see how many days it is from the first Monday in October, 2008 to the first Monday
              in November, 2008, use:

                evaltrig("Mon 1", '2008-11-01') - evaltrig("Mon 1", '2008-10-01')

              and the answer is 28.  The trigger argument to <b>evaltrig</b> can have all  the  usual  trigger  clauses
              (<b>OMIT</b>, <b>AT</b>, <b>SKIP</b>, etc.) but <u>cannot</u> have a <b>SATISFY</b>, <b>MSG</b>, etc. reminder-type clause.

       <b>filedate(s_filename)</b>
              Returns  the  modification date of <u>filename</u>.  If <u>filename</u> does not exist, or its modification date
              is before the year <b>baseyr()</b>, then 1 January of <b>baseyr()</b> is returned.

       <b>filedatetime(s_filename)</b>
              Returns the modification date  and  time  of  <u>filename</u>.   If  <u>filename</u>  does  not  exist,  or  its
              modification date is before the year <b>baseyr()</b>, then midnight, 1 January of <b>baseyr()</b> is returned.

       <b>filedir()</b>
              Returns  the  directory  that  contains the current file being processed.  It may be a relative or
              absolute pathname, but is guaranteed to be correct for use in an <b>INCLUDE</b> command as follows:

                 INCLUDE [filedir()]/stuff

              This includes the file "stuff" in the same directory as the current file  being  processed.   Note
              that this workaround is no longer necessary because <b>DO</b> <b>stuff</b> will achieve the same goal.

              Note  that  if  the  currently-processing  reminders  file  was specified as a symbolic link, then
              <b>filedir()</b> returns the directory containing the symbolic link and <u>not</u> the directory containing  the
              target  of  the  symbolic  link.   You  should avoid using symbolic links to files unless both the
              symbolic link and its target happen to be in the same directory.

       <b>filename()</b>
              Returns (as a <b>STRING</b>) the name of the current file being processed  by  <b>Remind</b>.   Inside  included
              files, returns the name of the included file.

       <b>getenv(s_envvar)</b>
              Similar  to  the  <b><a href="../man2/getenv.2.html">getenv</a></b>(2) system call.  Returns a string representing the value of the specified
              environment variable.  Returns "" if the environment variable is not defined.  Note that the names
              of environment variables are generally case-sensitive; thus, getenv("HOME") is  not  the  same  as
              getenv("home").

       <b>hebdate(i_day,</b> <b>s_hebmon</b> <b>[,idq_yrstart</b> <b>[,i_jahr</b> <b>[,i_aflag]]])</b>
              Support for Hebrew dates - see the section "THE HEBREW CALENDAR"

       <b>hebday(dq_date)</b>

       <b>hebyear(dq_date)</b>
              Support for Hebrew dates - see the section "THE HEBREW CALENDAR"

       <b>hour(tq_time)</b>
              Returns the hour component of <u>time</u>.

       <b>htmlescape(s_str)</b>
              Returns  a modified copy of <u>str</u> where "&lt;" is replaced with "&amp;lt;"; "&gt;" is replaced with "&amp;gt;" and
              "&amp;" is replaced with "&amp;amp;"

       <b>htmlstriptags(s_str)</b>
              Returns a modified copy of <u>str</u> where HTML tags are  stripped  out.   The  stripping  algorithm  is
              fairly  naive;  the  function  starts  stripping  characters when it encounters a "&lt;" and it stops
              stripping when it encounters a "&gt;".

       <b>iif(x_test1,</b> <b>x_arg1,</b> <b>[x_test2,</b> <b>x_arg2,...],</b> <b>x_default)</b>
              If <u>test1</u> is true, returns <u>arg1</u>.  Otherwise, if <u>test2</u> is true, returns <u>arg2</u>, and so on.  If all  of
              the <u>test</u> arguments are false, returns <u>default</u>.  Note that only those arguments needed to determine
              the  final  result  are  evaluated.   This function accepts an odd number of arguments - note that
              prior to version 03.00.05 of <b>Remind</b>, it accepted 3 arguments  only.   The  3-argument  version  of
              <b>iif()</b> is compatible with previous versions of <b>Remind</b>.

       <b>index(s_search,</b> <b>s_target</b> <b>[,i_start)</b>
              Returns  an  <b>INT</b>  that  is  the location of <u>target</u> in the string <u>search</u>.  The first character of a
              string is numbered 1.  If <u>target</u> does not exist in <u>search</u>, then 0 is returned.

              The optional parameter <u>start</u> specifies the position in  <u>search</u>  at  which  to  start  looking  for
              <u>target</u>.

       <b>isany(arg1</b> <b>[,arg2,</b> <b>...,</b> <b>argN]);</b>
              Returns  1  if  the  first  argument <u>arg1</u> is equal to any of the subsequent arguments <u>arg2</u> through
              <u>argN</u>; returns 0 otherwise.  Also returns 0 if called with only one argument.

              As an example, the following two expressions are equivalent:

                      (a == b) || (a == c) || (a == d) || (a == e)

                      isany(a, b, c, d, e)

       <b>isdst([d_date</b> <b>[,t_time]])</b> or <b>isdst(q_datetime)</b>
              Returns a positive number if daylight saving time is in effect on the  specified  date  and  time.
              <u>Date</u> defaults to <b>today()</b> and <u>time</u> defaults to midnight.

              Note  that this function is only as reliable as the C run-time library functions.  It is available
              starting with version 03.00.07 of <b>Remind</b>.

       <b>isleap(idq_arg)</b>
              Returns 1 if <u>arg</u> is a leap year, and 0 otherwise.  <u>Arg</u> can be an <b>INT</b>, <b>DATE</b> or <b>DATETIME</b> object.  If
              a <b>DATE</b> or <b>DATETIME</b> is supplied, then the year component is used in the test.

       <b>isomitted(dq_date)</b>
              Returns 1 if <u>date</u> is omitted, given the current global <b>OMIT</b> context.  Returns 0 otherwise.  (If  a
              datetime  is  supplied, only the date part is used.)  Note that any local <b>OMIT</b> or <b>OMITFUNC</b> clauses
              are <u>not</u> taken into account by this function.

       <b>language()</b>
              Returns a <b>STRING</b> naming the compiled-in language supported by  <b>Remind</b>.   Remind  used  to  support
              compiled-in  support  for other languages, but now all localization is done at run-time.  As such,
              this function always returns "English".  However, the  expression  <b>_("LANGID")</b>  returns  the  two-
              character  ISO 639 language code of any language pack in effect, assuming the language pack author
              has written the localization correctly!

       <b>localtoutc(q_datetime)</b>
              Given a <b>DATETIME</b> object interpreted in  the  local  time  zone,  return  a  <b>DATETIME</b>  object  that
              expresses the same time in UTC.

       <b>lower(s_string)</b>
              Returns a <b>STRING</b> with all upper-case characters in <u>string</u> converted to lower-case.

       <b>max(x_arg1</b> <b>[,x_arg2...)</b>
              Can  take any number of arguments, and returns the maximum.  The arguments can be of any type, but
              must all be of the same type.  They are compared as with the &gt; operator.

       <b>min(x_arg1</b> <b>[,x_arg2...)</b>
              Can take any number of arguments, and returns the minimum.  The arguments can be of any type,  but
              must all be of the same type.  They are compared as with the &lt; operator.

       <b>minsfromutc([d_date</b> <b>[,t_time]])</b> or <b>minsfromutc(q_datetime)</b>
              Returns  the number of minutes from Universal Time Coordinated (formerly GMT) to local time on the
              specified date and time.  <u>Date</u> defaults to <b>today()</b> and <u>time</u> defaults to midnight.  If  local  time
              is before UTC, the result is negative.  Otherwise, the result is positive.

              Note  that this function is only as reliable as the C run-time library functions.  It is available
              starting with version 03.00.07 of <b>Remind</b>.

       <b>minute(tq_time)</b>
              Returns the minute component of <u>time</u>.

       <b>mon(dqi_arg)</b>
              If <u>arg</u> is of <b>DATE</b> or <b>DATETIME</b> type, returns a string that names the month component of  the  date.
              If <u>arg</u> is an <b>INT</b> from 1 to 12, returns a string that names the month.

       <b>monnum(dq_date)</b>
              Returns an <b>INT</b> from 1 to 12, representing the month component of <u>date</u>.

       <b>moondate(i_phase</b> <b>[,d_date</b> <b>[,t_time]])</b> or <b>moondate(i_phase,</b> <b>q_datetime)</b>
              This  function returns the date of the first occurrence of the phase <u>phase</u> of the moon on or after
              <u>date</u> and <u>time</u>.  <u>Phase</u> can range from 0 to 3, with 0 signifying new moon, 1 first quarter,  2  full
              moon,  and  3  third quarter.  If <u>date</u> is omitted, it defaults to <b>today()</b>.  If <u>time</u> is omitted, it
              defaults to midnight.

              For example, the following returns the date of the next full moon:

                        SET fullmoon <a href="../man2/moondate.2.html">moondate</a>(2)

       <b>moontime(i_phase</b> <b>[,d_date</b> <b>[,t_time]])</b> or <b>moontime(i_phase,</b> <b>q_datetime)</b>
              This function returns the time of the first occurrence of the phase <u>phase</u> of the moon on or  after
              <u>date</u>  and  <u>time</u>.  <u>Phase</u> can range from 0 to 3, with 0 signifying new moon, 1 first quarter, 2 full
              moon, and 3 third quarter.  If <u>date</u> is omitted, it defaults to <b>today()</b>.  If <u>time</u>  is  omitted,  it
              defaults  to  midnight.   <b>Moontime()</b>  is  intended to be used in conjunction with <b>moondate()</b>.  The
              <b>moondate()</b> and <b>moontime()</b> functions are accurate to within a couple of minutes  of  the  times  in
              "Old Farmer's Almanac" for Ottawa, Ontario.

              For example, the following returns the date and time of the next full moon:

                        MSG Next full moon at [<a href="../man2/moontime.2.html">moontime</a>(2)] on [<a href="../man2/moondate.2.html">moondate</a>(2)]

       <b>moondatetime(i_phase</b> <b>[,d_date</b> <b>[,t_time]])</b> or <b>moondatetime(i_phase,</b> <b>q_datetime)</b>
              This function is similar to <b>moondate</b> and <b>moontime</b>, but returns a DATETIME result.

       <b>moonphase([d_date</b> <b>[,t_time]])</b> or <b>moonphase(q_datetime)</b>
              This  function  returns  the  phase  of  the  moon  on <u>date</u> and <u>time</u>, which default to <b>today()</b> and
              midnight, respectively.  The returned value is an integer from 0 to 359, representing the phase of
              the moon in degrees.  0 is a new moon, 180 is a full moon, 90 is first-quarter, etc.

       <b>multitrig(s_trig1</b> <b>[,s_trig2,</b> <b>[...</b> <b>s_trigN]])</b>
              <b>multitrig</b> evaluates each string as a trigger,  similar  to  <b>evaltrig</b>,  and  returns  the  <u>earliest</u>
              trigger  date  that  is  on  or after <b>today()</b>.  <b>multitrig</b> is similar to <b>trig</b> but has the following
              difference:

              <b>trig</b> returns the <u>first</u> trigger date that would have triggered today, whereas <b>multitrig</b> returns the
              <u>earliest</u> trigger date later than today, regardless of whether it would have triggered today.

              If no trigger can be computed that is later than <b>today()</b>, then <b>multitrig</b> returns 1990-01-01.

              Consider the following examples, assuming that today is Sunday, 24 March 2024:

                 # Returns 1990-01-01 because neither would trigger today
                 SET a trig("Mon", "Wed")

                 # Returns 2024-03-25 because it's the earlier trigger date
                 SET a multitrig("Mon", "Wed")

                 # Returns 2024-03-27 because it's the first that would trigger today
                 SET a trig("Wed +3", "Mon +3")

                 # Returns 2024-03-25 because it's the earlier trigger date
                 SET a multitrig("Wed +3", "Mon +3")

                 # Returns 1990-01-01 because all triggers have expired
                 SET a multitrig("2000", "2022", "1998", "2023")

              In general, <b>multitrig</b> works better with the Remind algorithm than <b>trig</b> and should be used most  of
              the time.  As an example, this reminder is issued at the end of each quarter:

                      REM [multitrig("Mar 31", "Jun 30", "Sep 30", "Dec 31")] +7 MSG \
                      %"End of [ord($Tm/3)] quarter%" is %b.

              If you want the last working day of each quarter, you could use:

                      PUSH-OMIT-CONTEXT
                      OMIT Sat Sun
                      REM [multitrig("Mar ~1", "Jun ~1", "Sep ~1", "Dec ~1")] +7 MSG \
                      %"Last working day of [ord($Tm/3)] quarter%" is %b.
                      POP-OMIT-CONTEXT

              Note  that unlike <b>evaltrig</b>, <b>multitrig</b> always returns a <b>DATE</b> and never a <b>DATETIME</b>.  Including an <b>AT</b>
              clause in a trigger supplied to <b>multitrig</b> will result in an error.

       <b>ndawn([dq_date])</b>
              Returns the time of "nautical dawn" on the specified  <u>date</u>.   If  <u>date</u>  is  omitted,  defaults  to
              <b>today()</b>.  If a <u>datetime</u> object is supplied, only the date component is used.

       <b>ndusk([dq_date])</b>
              Returns  the  time  of "nautical twilight" on the specified <u>date</u>.  If <u>date</u> is omitted, defaults to
              <b>today()</b>.

       <b>nonomitted(dq_start,</b> <b>dq_end</b> <b>[,</b> <b>i_step]</b> <b>[,s_wkday...])</b>
              This function returns the number of <u>non-</u>omitted days between <u>start</u> and  <u>end</u>.   If  <u>start</u>  is  non-
              omitted, then it is counted.  <u>end</u> is never counted.

              Note  that  if  <u>end</u>  is less than <u>start</u>, the arguments are effectively swapped, so counting always
              begins from the older date.

              If the third argument to <b>nonomitted</b> is an <b>INT</b>, then it must be greater than zero, and is  consider
              to be the <u>step</u> by which <b>nonomitted</b> counts.  For example the following expression:

                      nonomitted('2023-07-01', '2023-07-29', 7)

              returns  the number of non-omitted Saturdays from 2023-07-01 up to (but not including) 2023-07-29.
              (Both 2023-07-01 and 2023-07-29 are Saturdays.)

              If no <u>step</u> argument is supplied, then a step of 1 is used.

              In addition to using the global OMIT context, you can supply additional arguments that  are  names
              of weekdays to be omitted.  However, in a <b>REM</b> command, any local <b>OMITFUNC</b> clause is <u>not</u> taken into
              account by this function.

              For example, the following line sets a to 11 (assuming no global OMITs):

                   set a nonomitted('2007-08-01', '2007-08-16', "Sat", "Sun")

              because  Thursday, 16 August 2007 is the 11th working day (not counting Saturday and Sunday) after
              Wednesday, 1 August 2007.

              <b>nonomitted</b> has various uses.  For example, many schools run on a six-day cycle and the day  number
              is  not  incremented  on holidays.  Suppose the school year starts with Day 1 on 4 September 2007.
              The following reminder will label day numbers in a calendar:

                 IF today() &gt;= '2007-09-04'
                     set daynum nonomitted('2007-09-04', today(), "Sat", "Sun")
                     REM OMIT SAT SUN SKIP CAL Day [(daynum % 6) + 1]
                 ENDIF

              Obviously, the answer you get from <b>nonomitted</b> depends on the global  OMIT  context.   If  you  use
              movable OMITs, you may get inconsistent results.

              Here  is  a more complex use for <b>nonomitted</b>.  My garbage collection follows two interleaved 14-day
              cycles: One Friday, garbage and paper recycling ("Black Box") are  collected.   The  next  Friday,
              garbage  and  plastic recycling ("Blue Box") are collected.  If any of Monday-Friday is a holiday,
              collection is delayed until the Saturday.  Here's a way to encode these rules:

                 fset _garbhol(x) wkdaynum(x) == 5 &amp;&amp; nonomitted(x-4, x+1) &lt; 5
                 REM 12 November 1999 *14 AFTER OMITFUNC _garbhol MSG Black Box
                 REM 19 November 1999 *14 AFTER OMITFUNC _garbhol MSG Blue Box

              Here's how it works:  The _garbhol(x) user-defined function returns 1 if and only if (1)  <u>x</u>  is  a
              Friday  and (2) there is at least one OMITted day from the previous Monday up to and including the
              Friday.

              The first REM statement sets up the 14-day black-box cycle.   The  AFTER  keyword  makes  it  move
              collection  to  the  Saturday  if _garbhol returns 1.  The second REM statement sets up the 14-day
              blue-box cycle with a similar adjustment made by AFTER in conjunction with _garbhol.

       <b>now()</b>  Returns the current system time, as a <b>TIME</b> type.  This may be the actual time, or a time  supplied
              on the command line.

       <b>ord(i_num)</b>
              Returns  a string that is the ordinal number <u>num</u>.  For example, <b><a href="../man2/ord.2.html">ord</a>(2)</b> returns "2nd", and <b><a href="../man213/ord.213.html">ord</a>(213)</b>
              returns "213th".

       <b>orthodoxeaster([dqi_arg])</b>
              If <u>arg</u> is an <b>INT</b>, then returns the date of Orthodox Easter Sunday for the specified year.  If  <u>arg</u>
              is  a  <b>DATE</b> or <b>DATETIME</b>, then returns the date of the next Orthodox Easter Sunday on or after <u>arg</u>.
              (The time component of a datetime is ignored.)  If <u>arg</u> is omitted, then it defaults to <b>today()</b>.

              Note that <b>orthodoxeaster</b>  computes  the  Orthodox  Easter.   For  the  Western  Easter  date,  see
              <b>easterdate</b>.

       <b>ostype()</b>
              Returns "UNIX".  Remind used to run on OS/2 and MS-DOS, but does not any longer.

       <b>pad(x_arg,</b> <b>s_padstr,</b> <b>i_len</b> <b>[,</b> <b>i_right])</b>
              Converts  the  first  argument  <u>arg</u>  to  a string if necessary, and then if it is shorter than <u>len</u>
              characters, pads to to <u>len</u> characters using as many copies (including partial copies) of <u>padstr</u> as
              necessary.  By default, the string is left-padded, but if <u>right</u>  is  supplied  and  non-zero,  the
              string will be right-padded.

              Here are some examples:

                  pad(3, "0", 2)        --&gt;  "03"
                  pad(465, "0", 2)      --&gt;  "465"
                  pad("foo", " ", 5)    --&gt;  "  foo"
                  pad("foo", " ", 5, 1) --&gt;  "foo  "
                  pad("foo", "bar", 11) --&gt;  "barbarbafoo"

       <b>plural(i_num</b> <b>[,s_str1</b> <b>[,s_str2]])</b>
              Can  take  from one to three arguments.  If one argument is supplied, returns "s" if <u>num</u> is not 1,
              and "" if <u>num</u> is 1.

              If two arguments are supplied, returns <u>str1</u> + "s" if <u>num</u> is not 1.  Otherwise, returns <u>str1</u>.

              If three arguments are supplied, returns <u>str1</u> if <u>num</u> is 1, and <u>str2</u> otherwise.

       <b>psmoon(i_phase</b> <b>[,i_size</b> <b>[,s_note</b> <b>[,i_notesize]]])</b>
              [DEPRECATED] Returns a <b>STRING</b> consisting of PostScript code to draw a moon in the upper-left  hand
              corner  of the calendar box.  <u>Phase</u> specifies the phase of the moon, and is 0 (new moon), 1 (first
              quarter), 2 (full moon) or 3 (third quarter).  If <u>size</u> is specified, it controls the radius of the
              moon in PostScript units (1/72 inch.)  If it is not specified or is negative, the size of the day-
              number font is used.

              For example, the following four lines place moon symbols on the PostScript calendar:

                        REM [<a href="../man0/moondate.0.html">moondate</a>(0)] PS [<a href="../man0/psmoon.0.html">psmoon</a>(0)]
                        REM [<a href="../man1/moondate.1.html">moondate</a>(1)] PS [<a href="../man1/psmoon.1.html">psmoon</a>(1)]
                        REM [<a href="../man2/moondate.2.html">moondate</a>(2)] PS [<a href="../man2/psmoon.2.html">psmoon</a>(2)]
                        REM [<a href="../man3/moondate.3.html">moondate</a>(3)] PS [<a href="../man3/psmoon.3.html">psmoon</a>(3)]

              If <u>note</u> is specified, the text is used to annotate the moon display.  The font is  the  same  font
              used  for  calendar  entries.   If  <u>notesize</u>  is  given, it specifies the font size to use for the
              annotation, in PostScript units (1/72 inch.)  If <u>notesize</u> is not given, it defaults  to  the  size
              used  for  calendar  entries.   (If  you annotate the display, be careful not to overwrite the day
              number -- <b>Remind</b> does not check for this.)  For example, if you want the time  of  each  new  moon
              displayed, you could use this in your reminder script:

                   REM [<a href="../man0/moondate.0.html">moondate</a>(0)] PS [psmoon(0, -1, <a href="../man0/moontime.0.html">moontime</a>(0)+"")]

              Note how the time is coerced to a string by concatenating the null string.

       <b>psshade(i_gray)</b> or <b>psshade(i_red,</b> <b>i_green,</b> <b>i_blue)</b>
              [DEPRECATED]  Returns  a <b>STRING</b> that consists of PostScript commands to shade a calendar box.  <u>Num</u>
              can range from 0 (completely black) to 100 (completely white.)  If three arguments are given, they
              specify red, green and blue intensity from 0 to 100.  Here's an example of how to use this:

                        REM Sat Sun PS [<a href="../man95/psshade.95.html">psshade</a>(95)]

              The above command emits PostScript code to lightly shade the boxes for Saturday and  Sunday  in  a
              PostScript calendar.

              Note  that <b>psmoon</b> and <b>psshade</b> are deprecated; instead you should use the SPECIAL SHADE and SPECIAL
              MOON reminders as described in "Out-of-Band Reminders."

       <b>realcurrent()</b>
              Returns (as a DATETIME) the true date and time of day as provided by the operating  system.   This
              is in contrast to <b>current()</b>, which may return a time supplied on the command line.

       <b>realnow()</b>
              Returns  the  true time of day as provided by the operating system.  This is in contrast to <b>now()</b>,
              which may return a time supplied on the command line.

       <b>realtoday()</b>
              Returns the date as provided by the operating system.  This is in contrast to <b>Remind</b>'s concept  of
              "today", which may be changed if it is running in calendar mode, or if a date has been supplied on
              the command line.

       <b>rows()</b> If  standard  output  is a TTY, returns the height of the terminal in rows.  If standard output is
              not a TTY, attempts to open "/dev/tty" to obtain the terminal size.  If this fails, returns -1.

       <b>sgn(i_num)</b>
              Returns -1 if <u>num</u> is negative, 1 if <u>num</u> is positive, and 0 if <u>num</u> is zero.

       <b>shell(s_cmd</b> <b>[,i_maxlen])</b>
              Executes <u>cmd</u> as a system command, and returns the first 511 characters of  output  resulting  from
              <u>cmd</u>.   Any  whitespace  character in the output is converted to a space.  Note that if <b>RUN</b> <b>OFF</b> has
              been executed, or the <b>-r</b> command-line option has been used, <b>shell()</b> will result in an  error,  and
              <u>cmd</u> will not be executed.

              If  <u>maxlen</u>  is  specified, then <b>shell()</b> returns the first <u>maxlen</u> characters of output (rather than
              the first 511).  If <u>maxlen</u> is specified as a negative number, then it defaults to the value of the
              system variable <b>$MaxStringLen</b>.

       <b>shellescape(s_str)</b>
              Returns <u>str</u> with all shell metacharacters such as " ", "*", etc escaped  with  a  backslash.   For
              example:

               SET a shellescape("a b*? c&amp;d$e")

              will set <b>a</b> to:

               "a\ b\*\?\ c\&amp;d\$e"

       <b>slide(d_start,</b> <b>i_amt</b> <b>[,</b> <b>i_step]</b> <b>[,s_wkday...])</b>
              This  function  is  the inverse of <b>nonomitted</b>.  It adds <u>amt</u> (which can be negative) chunks of <u>step</u>
              days to <u>start</u>, <u>not</u> <u>counting</u> <u>omitted</u> <u>days</u>.  If <u>step</u> is not supplied, then it is assumed  to  be  1.
              Note  that  only every <u>step</u>th day is tested to see if it is omitted.  The optional <u>wkday</u> arguments
              are additional weekday names to omit.

              Consider this example:

                   OMIT 14 May 2009
                   SET a slide('2009-05-13', 5, "Sat", "Sun")

              In this case, <u>a</u> is set to 2009-05-21.  That's because we slide forward by 5  days,  not  including
              Thursday, May 14 or Saturday and Sunday, May 16 and 17.  You can go backwards, too, so:

                   OMIT 14 May 2009
                   SET a slide('2009-05-21', -5, "Sat", "Sun")

              takes <u>a</u> back to 2009-05-13.

              Now consider this example:

                      OMIT 14 May 2009
                      SET a slide('2009-05-07', 2, 7)

              This  sets <u>a</u> to '2009-05-28' because we skip ahead two weeks, not counting a week where the day we
              land on happens to be omitted.  Contrast with this:

                      OMIT 13 May 2009
                      SET a slide('2009-05-07', 2, 7)

              which sets <u>a</u> to '2009-05-21'.  Although 2009-05-13 is omitted, we don't "land" on it  as  we  step
              forward in chunks of 7 days, so we never see that it is omitted.

       <b>soleq(i_which</b> <b>[,</b> <b>dqi_start])</b>
              The  <b>soleq</b> function computes solstices and equinoxes.  The <u>which</u> parameter ranges from 0 to 3, and
              specifies which event we are interested in: 0 is the March equinox; 1 is the June solstice;  2  is
              the September equinox and 3 is the December solstice.

              The  optional  <u>start</u>  parameter  can  either be an integer specifying the year of the event we are
              interested in, or a <b>DATE</b> or <b>DATETIME</b> object; if the latter, then <b>soleq</b> returns the first event  on
              or  after  the  date  part  of  the  <u>start</u>  parameter (it ignores the time component if <u>start</u> is a
              <b>DATETIME</b>.)  If <u>start</u> is not supplied, then it defaults to <b>today()</b>.

              The return value of <b>soleq()</b> is a <b>DATETIME</b> object specifying the date and time of the  solstice  or
              equinox  in  the  local  time  zone.  It should be accurate to within 3 minutes or so in the worst
              case.

              See the included file <b>$SysInclude/seasons.rem</b> for examples of how to use <b>soleq()</b>.

       <b>stdout()</b>
              Returns a string representing where Remind's standard output is going.  The return values are  one
              of the following: "TTY" if standard-output is a terminal, "BLOCKDEV" if it is a block device (very
              unlikely), "CHARDEV" if it is a character device (eg, /dev/null), "DIR" if it is a directory (very
              unlikely),  "PIPE" if it is a pipe or FIFO, "SYMLINK" if it is a symlink (very unlikely), "SOCKET"
              if it is a socket, or "UNKNOWN" if it could not be determined.

              The purpose of <b>stdout()</b> is mostly to distinguish between TTY and non-TTY output; you may  wish  to
              change or disable colors if the output is not going to a TTY.

       <b>strlen(s_str)</b>
              Returns  the length of <u>str</u>.  If the length of <u>str</u> is too large to represent as an integer, emits a
              "Number too high" error.  Note that <b>strlen</b> returns the number of <u>bytes</u>  in  the  string,  not  the
              number  of  <u>characters</u>.   These  numbers  are the same for ASCII strings, but may be different for
              UTF-8 strings.

       <b>substr(s_str,</b> <b>i_start</b> <b>[,i_end])</b>
              Returns a <b>STRING</b> consisting of all  characters  in  <u>str</u>  from  <u>start</u>  up  to  and  including  <u>end</u>.
              Characters are numbered from 1.  If <u>end</u> is not supplied, then it defaults to the length of <u>str</u>.

       <b>sunrise([dq_date])</b>
              Returns  a  <b>TIME</b>  indicating the time of sunrise on the specified <u>date</u> (default <b>today()</b>.)  In high
              latitudes, there may be no sunrise on a particular day, in which case <b>sunrise()</b> returns the <b>INT</b>  0
              if the sun never sets, or 1440 if it never rises.

       <b>sunset([dq_date])</b>
              Returns  a  <b>TIME</b>  indicating  the time of sunset on the specified <u>date</u> (default <b>today()</b>.)  In high
              latitudes, there may be no sunset on a particular day, in which case <b>sunset()</b> returns the <b>INT</b> 0 if
              the sun never rises, or 1440 if it never sets.

              The functions <b>sunrise()</b> and <b>sunset()</b> are based on an algorithm in "Almanac for Computers  for  the
              year  1978"  by  L.  E.  Doggett,  Nautical  Almanac  Office, USNO.  They require the latitude and
              longitude to be specified by setting the appropriate system variables.  (See "System  Variables".)
              The  sun  functions  should  be  accurate  to  within  about 4 minutes for latitudes lower than 60
              degrees.  The functions are available starting from version 03.00.07 of <b>Remind</b>.

       <b>time(i_hr,</b> <b>i_min)</b>
              Creates a <b>TIME</b> with the hour and minute components specified by <u>hr</u> and <u>min</u>.

       <b>timepart(tq_datetime)</b>
              Returns a <b>TIME</b> object representing the time portion of <u>datetime</u>.

       <b>timezone([dq_datetime])</b>
              Returns a string representing the local time zone name of the given <b>DATETIME</b>.  If no  argument  is
              supplied,  <b>Remind</b> uses the value of <b>current()</b>.  If a <b>DATE</b> rather than <b>DATETIME</b> is supplied, <b>Remind</b>
              uses a time part of 00:00.

       <b>today()</b>
              Returns <b>Remind</b>'s notion of "today."  This may be the actual system date, or a date supplied on the
              command line, or the date of the calendar entry currently being computed.

       <b>trig(s_1</b> <b>[,s_2,</b> <b>...])</b>
              For each string argument s_<u>n</u>,  <b>trig</b>  evaluates  s_<u>n</u>  as  if  it  were  a  REM  or  IFTRIG  trigger
              specification.   If  the  trigger  would  trigger  today, then the trigger date is returned and no
              further triggers are evaluated.  If none of the triggers would trigger today, then the  zero  date
              1990-01-01 is returned.
              <b>trig</b> also has a zero-argument form; this returns the trigger date of the <u>most</u> <u>recent</u> <b>trig</b> function
              that returned a non-zero trigger date.

              <b>trig</b> can be used to make more sophisticated versions of <b>IFTRIG</b>.  For example, if you have meetings
              every Monday in June and July, and you want warnings 3 days in advance, you could use:

                  REM [trig("Mon Jun +3", "Mon July +3")] +3 MSG Meeting %b

              NOTE:  We  need  to  repeat  the +3 delta outside of the <b>trig</b> function for advance warning to work
              properly.  This is because <b>trig</b> returns a date constant (the trigger date)  and  the  REM  command
              does not know the details of <b>trig</b>'s arguments.

              Note that because <b>Remind</b> has short-circuit logical operators, something like:

                  SET a trig("Mon +7") || trig("Fri +7")

              would  set the value of trig() to the date of the following Monday.  Because trig("Mon +7") always
              returns true, the logical-OR operator does not bother evaluating trig("Fri  +7")  which  therefore
              does not set <b>trig()</b>.

              <b>Important</b>  <b>Note</b>:  Because <b>trig()</b> always returns an absolute date, it will <b>not</b> work properly with a
              <b>SATISFY</b> clause.  Consider this reminder:

                  REM [trig("Mar", "Apr")] SATISFY [$Td == 15] MSG 15 Mar or April

              If we run <b>Remind</b> on 5 March 2022, we might expect the trigger date to be calculated  as  15  March
              2022...  but  that's  not  what  happens.   Instead,  the <b>trig</b> function is evaluated first, and it
              returns 2022-03-05.  So as far as <b>Remind</b> is concerned, the REM statement becomes:

                  REM 2022-03-05 SATISFY [$Td == 15] MSG 15 Mar or April

              and the SATISFY expression is never true.  So: <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>mix</u> <u>trig()</u> <u>and</u> <u>SATISFY</u>.

       <b>trigdate()</b>
              Returns the calculated trigger date of the last <b>REM</b> or <b>IFTRIG</b> command.  If used in the <u>body</u>  of  a
              <b>REM</b>  command, returns that command's trigger date.  If the most recent <b>REM</b> command did not yield a
              computable trigger date, returns the integer 0.

       <b>trigdatetime()</b>
              Similar to trigdate(), but returns a <b>DATETIME</b> if the most recent triggerable <b>REM</b> command had an <b>AT</b>
              clause.  If there was no <b>AT</b> clause, returns a <b>DATE</b>.  If no trigger could be computed, returns  the
              integer 0.  See "MULTI-DAY EVENTS" for more information.

       <b>trigeventstart()</b>
              Returns  a  <b>DATETIME</b> representing the start of the most recent triggerable <b>REM</b> command that had an
              <b>AT</b> clause.  For events without a <b>DURATION</b> or that do not span multiple days, returns the  same  as
              <b>trigdatetime()</b>.  If the <b>REM</b> command did not have an <b>AT</b> clause, returns the integer -1 (and differs
              from <b>trigdatetime()</b> in this respect.)  See "MULTI-DAY EVENTS" for more information.

       <b>trigeventduration()</b>
              Returns a <b>TIME</b> representing the duration of the most recent triggerable <b>REM</b> command that had an <b>AT</b>
              and  a  <b>DURATION</b>  clause.   If  the  event  does not span multiple days, returns the same thing as
              <b>trigduration()</b>.  If the <b>REM</b> command lacked an <b>AT</b> or <b>DURATION</b> clause, returns -1.   See  "MULTI-DAY
              EVENTS" for more information.

       <b>trigback()</b>
              Returns  the "back" amount of the last <b>REM</b> or <b>IFTRIG</b> command.  Returns a positive integer N if the
              "back" is of the form -N, or a negative integer if it is of the form --N.  If there is no  "back",
              then returns 0.

       <b>trigdelta()</b>
              Returns the "delta" amount of the last <b>REM</b> or <b>IFTRIG</b> command.  Returns a positive integer N if the
              "delta"  is  of  the  form  +N,  or  a  negative integer if it is of the form ++N.  If there is no
              "delta", then returns 0.

       <b>trigtimedelta()</b>
              Similar to <b>trigdelta()</b>, but returns the delta used in the <b>AT</b> clause of a timed reminder.

       <b>trigrep()</b>
              Returns the "repeat" amount of the last <b>REM</b> or <b>IFTRIG</b> command.  Returns a positive  integer  N  if
              the "repeat" is of the form *N.  If there is no "repeat", then returns 0.

       <b>trigtimerep()</b>
              Similar to <b>trigrep()</b>, but returns the repeat used in the <b>AT</b> clause of a timed reminder.

       <b>trigduration()</b>
              Returns  (as  a  TIME  type)  the <b>DURATION</b> parameter of a timed reminder.  If there is no <b>DURATION</b>
              parameter, returns the integer -1.  See "MULTI-DAY EVENTS" for more information.

       <b>trigpriority()</b>
              Returns the <b>PRIORITY</b> of the last <b>REM</b> or <b>IFTRIG</b> command.

       <b>triguntil()</b>
              Returns (as a <b>DATE</b> type) the <b>UNTIL</b> parameter of the last <b>REM</b> or <b>IFTRIG</b> command.  If there  was  no
              <b>UNTIL</b>  parameter,  returns the integer -1.  If there is a <b>THROUGH</b> parameter, that will be returned
              by <b>triguntil()</b> since "THROUGH yyyy-mm-dd" is simply syntactic sugar for "*1 UNTIL yyyy-mm-dd".

       <b>trigscanfrom()</b>
              Returns (as a <b>DATE</b> type) the <b>SCANFROM</b> parameter of the last <b>REM</b> or <b>IFTRIG</b> command.  If  there  was
              no  <b>SCANFROM</b>  parameter, returns the integer -1.  Note that <b>FROM</b> and <b>SCANFROM</b> interact; a reminder
              that has a "FROM yyyy-mm-dd" parameter will act as if it has a <b>SCANFROM</b> parameter whose  value  is
              the maximum of "yyyy-mm-dd" and today.

       <b>trigfrom()</b>
              Returns  (as  a  <b>DATE</b> type) the <b>FROM</b> parameter of the last <b>REM</b> or <b>IFTRIG</b> command.  If there was no
              <b>FROM</b> parameter, returns the integer -1.

       <b>triginfo(s_header)</b>
              Returns a <b>STRING</b> that is the INFO item associated with the header <u>header</u>.  The header  should  <u>not</u>
              contain a colon.  Header name comparisons are case-insensitive.

              For  example,  the  following  will  assign  "At  home"  to the variable a and the empty string to
              variable b:

                      REM INFO "Location: At home" MSG test
                      SET a triginfo("location")
                      SET b triginfo("no_such_header")

       <b>trigger(d_date</b> <b>[,t_time</b> <b>[,i_utcflag]])</b> or <b>trigger(q_datetime</b> <b>[,i_utcflag])</b>
              Returns a string suitable for use in a <b>REM</b> command or a <b>SCANFROM</b> or UNTIL clause, allowing you  to
              calculate trigger dates in advance.  Note that in earlier versions of <b>Remind</b>, <b>trigger</b> was required
              to  convert  a  date  into  something  the <b>REM</b> command could consume.  However, in this version of
              <b>Remind</b>, you can omit it.  Note that <b>trigger()</b> <u>always</u> returns its result in English, even for  non-
              English  versions of <b>Remind</b>.  Normally, the <u>date</u> and <u>time</u> are the local date and time; however, if
              <u>utcflag</u> is non-zero, the <u>date</u> and <u>time</u> are interpreted as UTC times, and are  converted  to  local
              time.  Examples:

                   trigger('1993/04/01')

              returns "1 April 1993",

                   trigger('1994/08/09', 12:33)

              returns "9 August 1994 AT 12:33", as does:

                   trigger('1994/08/09@12:33').

              Finally:

                   trigger('1994/12/01', 03:00, 1)

              returns "30 November 1994 AT 22:00" for EST, which is 5 hours behind UTC.  The value for your time
              zone may differ.

       <b>trigtags()</b>
              Returns  a  comma-separated  list of the TAGs associated with the most recent <b>REM</b> command that was
              triggered.  Returns the empty string if there were no TAGs.  If there are multiple tags, they  are
              each separated by a single comma, not a comma and a space.

       <b>trigtime()</b>
              Returns  the  time  of the last <b>REM</b> command with an <b>AT</b> clause.  If the last <b>REM</b> did not have an <b>AT</b>
              clause, returns the integer 0.  If a <b>REM</b> command has an <b>AT</b> clause with a <b>DURATION</b>,  then  you  can
              compute the end time as <b>trigtime()</b> <b>+</b> <b>trigduration()</b>.

       <b>trigvalid()</b>
              Returns  1  if  the  value  returned  by <b>trigdate()</b> is valid for the most recent <b>REM</b> command, or 0
              otherwise.  Sometimes <b>REM</b> commands cannot calculate a trigger date.  For  example,  the  following
              <b>REM</b> command can never be triggered:

                 REM Mon OMIT Mon SKIP MSG Impossible!

       <b>typeof(x_arg)</b>
              Returns "STRING", "INT", "DATE", "TIME" or "DATETIME", depending on the type of <u>arg</u>.

       <b>tzconvert(q_datetime,</b> <b>s_srczone</b> <b>[,s_dstzone])</b>
              Converts  <b>datetime</b>  from  the  time  zone  named by <b>srczone</b> to the time zone named by <b>dstzone</b>.  If
              <b>dstzone</b> is omitted, the default system time zone is used.  The return value is a  DATETIME.   Time
              zone  names  are  system-dependent;  consult  your  operating system for legal values.  Here is an
              example:

           tzconvert('2007-07-08@01:14', "Canada/Eastern", "Canada/Pacific")

                 returns

           2007-07-07@22:14

       <b>upper(s_string)</b>
              Returns a <b>STRING</b> with all lower-case characters in <u>string</u> converted to upper-case.

       <b>utctolocal(q_datetime)</b>
              Given a <b>DATETIME</b> object interpreted in UTC, return a <b>DATETIME</b> object that expresses the same  time
              in the local time zone.

       <b>value(s_varname</b> <b>[,x_default])</b>
              Returns  the  value  of  the specified variable.  For example, value("X"+"Y") returns the value of
              variable XY, if it is defined.  If XY is not defined, an error results.

              However, if you supply a second argument, it is returned if  the  <u>varname</u>  is  not  defined.   The
              expression  value("XY",  0)  will  return  0  if  XY  is not defined, and the value of XY if it is
              defined.

       <b>version()</b>
              Returns a string specifying the version of <b>Remind</b>.  For version 05.03.02, returns "05.03.02".   It
              is  guaranteed  that  as new versions of <b>Remind</b> are released, the value returned by <b>version()</b> will
              strictly increase, according to the rules for string ordering.

       <b>weekno([dq_date,</b> <b>[i_wkstart,</b> <b>[i_daystart]]])</b>
              Returns the week number of the year.  If no arguments are supplied,  returns  the  ISO  8601  week
              number  for  <b>today()</b>.  If one argument <u>date</u> is supplied, then returns the ISO 8601 week number for
              that date.  If two arguments are supplied, then <u>wkstart</u> must range from 0 to 6, and represents the
              first day of the week (with 0 being Sunday and 6 being Saturday.).  If <u>wkstart</u>  is  not  supplied,
              then  it defaults to 1.  If the third argument <u>daystart</u> is supplied, then it specifies when Week 1
              starts.  If <u>daystart</u> is less than or equal to 7, then Week 1 starts on the  first  <u>wkstart</u>  on  or
              after  January  <u>daystart</u>.   Otherwise,  Week  1  starts  on the first <u>wkstart</u> on or after December
              <u>daystart</u>.  If omitted, <u>daystart</u> defaults to 29 (following the ISO 8601 definition.)

       <b>wkday(dqi_arg)</b>
              If <u>arg</u> is a <b>DATE</b> or <b>DATETIME</b>, returns a string representing the day of the week of the  date.   If
              <u>arg</u> is an <b>INT</b> from 0 to 6, returns the corresponding weekday ("Sunday" to "Saturday").

       <b>wkdaynum(dq_date)</b>
              Returns  a  number  from 0 to 6 representing the day-of-week of the specified <u>date</u>.  (0 represents
              Sunday, and 6 represents Saturday.)

       <b>year(dq_date)</b>
              Returns a <b>INT</b> that is the year component of <u>date</u>.

</pre><h4><b>MULTI-DAY</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       If you specify a start time with <b>AT</b> and a duration  with  <b>DURATION</b>,  you  can  create  events  that  span
       multiple days.  Consider these two REM statements:

           REM 1991-02-13 AT 16:00 DURATION 72:00 MSG 72-hour event
           REM 1991-02-13 THROUGH 1991-02-16 AT 16:00 MSG Four events

       The  first  statement creates a <u>single</u> event that starts on 13 February 1991 at 16:00 and runs through 16
       February 1991 at 16:00

       The second statements creates <u>four</u> <u>separate</u> events that start at 16:00 on 13, 14, 15 and 16 February 1991
       and have indefinite duration.

       Remind handles multi-day events specially.  These are the rules:

       On the <u>first</u> day of a multi-day event, <b>trigdatetime()</b> will return the  starting  date  and  time  of  the
       event, and <b>trigduration()</b> will return the original DURATION.

       On  each <u>subsequent</u> day of a multi-day event, <b>trigdatetime()</b> will return midnight on the day in question,
       and <b>trigduration()</b> will return the <u>remaining</u> duration.  Consider this example:

           #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
           remind - 12 feb 1991 '*6' &lt;&lt;'EOF'
           BANNER %
           REM 1991-02-13 AT 16:00 DURATION 72:00 SATISFY 1
           set a trigdatetime()
           set b trigduration()
           set c trigeventstart()
           set d trigeventduration()
           MSG now=[today()] dt=[a] dur=[b] estart=[c] edur=[d]%
           EOF

       The output is:

       now=1991-02-12 dt=1991-02-13@16:00 dur=72:00 estart=1991-02-13@16:00 edur=72:00
       now=1991-02-13 dt=1991-02-13@16:00 dur=72:00 estart=1991-02-13@16:00 edur=72:00
       now=1991-02-14 dt=1991-02-14@00:00 dur=64:00 estart=1991-02-13@16:00 edur=72:00
       now=1991-02-15 dt=1991-02-15@00:00 dur=40:00 estart=1991-02-13@16:00 edur=72:00
       now=1991-02-16 dt=1991-02-16@00:00 dur=16:00 estart=1991-02-13@16:00 edur=72:00
       now=1991-02-17 dt=1991-02-13@16:00 dur=72:00 estart=-1 edur=-1

       As you see, the <b>trigdatetime()</b> and <b>trigduration()</b> functions return the start time  and  duration  of  the
       <u>remaining</u>  portion  of  a multi-day event, whereas <b>trigeventstart</b> and <b>trigeventduration</b> always return the
       original start and duration of the multi-day  event.   Note  also  that  the  return  value  for  expired
       reminders  is  not reliable; the fact that <b>trigeventstart</b> and <b>trigeventduration</b> return -1 in that case is
       an implementation artifact.

       <b>SELF-OVERLAPPING</b> <b>EVENTS</b>

       A multi-day event has the possibility of "overlapping itself".  When this  happens,  <b>Remind</b>  prefers  the
       <u>later</u> event (only one copy of an event is ever triggered for a given date.)  Consider this example:

          #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
          remind - '*5' 10 Feb 1991 &lt;&lt;'EOF'

          BANNER %
          REM MON at 0:00 DURATION 192:0 MSG [today()] [trigeventstart()] [trigduration()]%

          EOF

       The output is:

          1991-02-10 1991-02-04@00:00 48:00
          1991-02-11 1991-02-11@00:00 192:00
          1991-02-12 1991-02-11@00:00 168:00
          1991-02-13 1991-02-11@00:00 144:00
          1991-02-14 1991-02-11@00:00 120:00

       Although  the  event  from  1991-02-04  still  has  24  hours left on 1991-02-11, the fresh occurrence on
       1991-02-11 takes precedences and is the one that is triggered.

       I do not recommend constructing self-overlapping multi-day events.

</pre><h4><b>EXPRESSION</b> <b>PASTING</b></h4><pre>
       An extremely powerful feature of <b>Remind</b> is its macro capability, or "expression pasting."

       In almost any situation where <b>Remind</b> is not expecting an expression, you can "paste"  an  expression  in.
       To do this, surround the expression with square brackets.  For example:

            REM [mydate] MSG foo

       This evaluates the expression "mydate", where "mydate" is presumably some pre-computed variable, and then
       "pastes" the result into the command-line for the parser to process.

       If you want a literal "[" character for some reason, simply use "[[".  For example:

               REM MSG Here are [[square] brackets!

       A  formal  description  of  this  is:   When <b>Remind</b> encounters a "pasted-in" expression, it evaluates the
       expression, and coerces the result to a <b>STRING</b>.   It  then  substitutes  the  string  for  the  pasted-in
       expression,  and  continues  parsing.   Note,  however,  that  expressions  are  evaluated only once, not
       recursively.  Thus, writing:

            ["[a+b]"]

       causes <b>Remind</b> to read the token "[a+b]".  It does not interpret this as a pasted-in expression.  In fact,
       the only way to get a literal left-bracket into a reminder is to use ["["].

       You can use expression pasting almost anywhere.  However, there are a few exceptions:

       o      If <b>Remind</b> is expecting an expression, as in the <b>SET</b> command, or the <b>IF</b>  command,  you  should  <b>not</b>
              include square brackets.  For example, use:

                 SET a 4+5
       and not:
                 SET a [4+5]

       o      You  cannot use expression pasting for the first token on a line.  For example, the following will
              not work:

                 ["SET"] a 1

              This restriction is because <b>Remind</b> must be able to unambiguously determine the first  token  of  a
              line for the flow-control commands (to be discussed later.)

              In  fact,  if  <b>Remind</b>  cannot  determine  the  first  token on a line, it assumes that it is a <b>REM</b>
              command.  If expression-pasting is used, <b>Remind</b> assumes it is a <b>REM</b> command.  Thus, the  following
              three commands are equivalent:

                        REM 12 Nov 1993 AT 13:05 MSG BOO!
                        12 Nov 1993 AT 13:05 MSG BOO!
                        [12] ["Nov " + 1993] AT [12:05+60] MSG BOO!

       o      You  cannot  use  expression-pasting to determine the type (<b>MSG</b>, <b>CAL</b>, etc.) of a <b>REM</b> command.  You
              can paste expressions before and after the <b>MSG</b>, etc. keywords, but cannot do something like this:

                      REM ["12 Nov 1993 AT 13:05 " + "MSG" + " BOO!"]

              However, as an escape hatch, the sequence <b>SPECIAL</b> <u>type</u> means the same thing  as  just  <u>type</u>  where
              <u>type</u> is one of MSG, MSF, RUN, CAL, PS and PSFILE.  This lets you do something like this:

                      SET type "MSG"
                      REM 12 Nov 2024 SPECIAL [type] Hello

              You  can use this to control the types of your reminders based on variables you set, how Remind is
              invoked, etc.

       <b>COMMON</b> <b>PITFALLS</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>EXPRESSION</b> <b>PASTING</b>

       Remember that extra spaces are not inserted when an expression is pasted.  Thus, something like:

            REM[expr]MSG[expr]

       will probably fail.

       If you use an expression to calculate a <u>delta</u> or <u>back</u>, ensure that  the  result  is  a  positive  number.
       Something like:

            REM +[mydelta] Nov 12 1993 MSG foo

       will fail if <u>mydelta</u> happens to be negative.

</pre><h4><b>FLOW</b> <b>CONTROL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Remind</b> has commands that control the flow of a reminder script.  Normally, reminder scripts are processed
       sequentially.   However,  <b>IF</b>  and  related  commands  allow  you to process files conditionally, and skip
       sections that you don't want interpreted.

       <b>THE</b> <b>IF</b> <b>COMMAND</b>

       The <b>IF</b> command has the following form:

            IF expr
                 t-command
                 t-command...
            ELSE
                 f-command
                 f-command...
            ENDIF

       Note that the commands are shown indented for clarity.  Also,  the  <b>ELSE</b>  portion  can  be  omitted.   <b>IF</b>
       commands  can be nested up to a small limit, probably around 8 or 16 levels of nesting, depending on your
       system.

       If the <u>expr</u> evaluates to a non-zero <b>INT</b>, a <b>DATE</b> that is not 1990-01-01, a  <b>TIME</b>  that  is  not  00:00,  a
       <b>DATETIME</b>  that is not 1990-01-01@00:00, or a non-null <b>STRING</b>, then the <b>IF</b> portion is considered true, and
       the <u>t-commands</u> are executed.  If <u>expr</u> evaluates to zero or null, then the <u>f-commands</u> (if the <b>ELSE</b> portion
       is present) are executed.

       Examples:

            IF defined("want_hols")
                 INCLUDE /usr/share/remind/holidays
            ENDIF

            IF today() &gt; '1992/2/10'
                 set missed_ap "You missed it!"
            ELSE
                 set missed_ap "Still have time..."
            ENDIF

       <b>THE</b> <b>IFTRIG</b> <b>COMMAND</b>

       The <b>IFTRIG</b> command is similar to an <b>IF</b> command, except  that  it  computes  a  trigger  (as  in  the  <b>REM</b>
       command), and evaluates to true if a corresponding <b>REM</b> command would trigger.  Examples:

            IFTRIG 1 Nov
                 ; Executed on 1 Nov
            ELSE
                 ; Executed except on 1 Nov
            ENDIF

            IFTRIG 1 -1 OMIT Sat Sun +4
                 ; Executed on last working day of month,
                 ; and the 4 working days preceding it
            ELSE
                 ; Executed except on above days
            ENDIF

       Note  that  the  <b>IFTRIG</b>  command  computes  a  trigger  date,  which can be retrieved with the <b>trigdate()</b>
       function.  You can use all of the normal trigger components, such as <b>UNTIL</b>, <u>delta</u>,  etc.  in  the  <b>IFTRIG</b>
       command.   However,  you  cannot  use  a  type specifier such as <b>CAL</b>, <b>MSG</b> or <b>SATISFY</b>; attempting to do so
       yields a parse error.

</pre><h4><b>USER-DEFINED</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the built-in functions, <b>Remind</b> allows you to define your own functions.  The <b>FSET</b>  command
       does this for you:

       <b>FSET</b> <u>fname</u>(<u>args</u>) <u>expr</u>

       <u>Fname</u>  is  the  name  of the function, and follows the convention for naming variables.  <u>Args</u> is a comma-
       separated list of arguments, and <u>expr</u> is an expression.  <u>Args</u> can be empty, in which case  you  define  a
       function taking no parameters.  Here are some examples:

            FSET double(x) 2*x
            FSET yeardiff(date1, date2) year(date1) - year(date2)
            FSET since(x) ord($Ty - x)

       The last function is useful in birthday reminders.  For example:

            REM 1 Nov +12 MSG Dean's [<a href="../man1984/since.1984.html">since</a>(1984)] birthday is %b.

       Dean was born in 1984.  The above example, on 1 November 1992, would print:

            Dean's 8th birthday is today.

       Similarly, the function is useful in anniversary reminders.  For example:

               REM 4 June MSG [<a href="../man1989/since.1989.html">since</a>(1989)] anniversary of the Tienanmen Square massacre

       Notes:

       o      If  you  access a variable in <u>expr</u> that is not in the list of arguments, the global value (if any)
              is used.

       o      Function and parameter names are significant to 64 characters.

       o      The <b>value()</b> function <u>always</u> accesses the global value of a variable, even if it has the same  name
              as an argument.  For example:

                        fset func(x) value("x")
                        set x 1
                        set y <a href="../man5/func.5.html">func</a>(5)

              The above sequence sets y to 1, which is the global value of x.

       o      User-defined   functions  may  call  other  functions,  including  other  user-defined  functions.
              Recursive calls are allowed, but they must  terminate  (for  example,  by  using  a  short-circuit
              operator  or  function  that breaks the recursion) or an error will result after a certain maximum
              number of recursive calls (by default, 1000.)

       o      If a user-defined function has the same name as a built-in function, it is ignored and the  built-
              in  function  is used.  To prevent conflicts with future versions of <b>Remind</b> (which may define more
              built-in functions), you may wish to name all user-defined functions beginning with an underscore.

       To delete a user-defined function, use  <b>FUNSET</b>.   This  takes  a  space-separated  list  of  user-defined
       functions to delete.  For example, after the command:

               FUNSET myfunc1 otherfunc thirdfunc

       it is guaranteed that no user-defined functions named myfunc1, otherfunc or thirdfunc will exist.  <b>Remind</b>
       does  not issue an error if you try to <b>FUNSET</b> a nonexistent user-defined function; it simply does nothing
       in that case.

       You can rename a user-defined function with <b>FRENAME</b>.  This takes two names:  An old name and a new  name.
       Consider this command:

               FRENAME func_a func_b

       If <u>func_a</u> does not exist, the command unsets <u>func_b</u> if it is defined.  However, if <u>func_a</u> exists, then it
       is  renamed  to  <u>func_b</u>,  and  <u>func_a</u>  is  no longer defined.  If <u>func_b</u> was defined prior to the <b>FRENAME</b>
       command, then that old definition is lost.

       <b>FRENAME</b> is useful if you want to save and  restore  the  definition  of  a  user-defined  function.   For
       example,  you  might  want  to  define a <b>msgprefix</b> function for a block of reminders, but not permanently
       overwrite any existing definition.  You could do something like this:

               FRENAME msgprefix saved_msgprefix
               FSET msgprefix(x) "My new prefix: "
               INCLUDE block_of_reminders.rem
               FRENAME saved_msgprefix msgprefix

       The file <b>block_of_reminders.rem</b> would be executed with the
       <b>msgprefix</b> function defined above.  After the second FRENAME,
       <b>msgprefix</b> would be restored to its previous definition if
       it had one, or simply unset if it was not previously defined.

       If either argument to the <b>FRENAME</b> command is the name of a built-in
       function, the command fails with an error message and does nothing.

       If you define a user-defined function and then later on redefine it,
       <b>Remind</b> will issue a warning.  If you do not want this warning,
       then use <b>FUNSET</b> to remove the existing definition before you
       redefine the function.

</pre><h4><b>PRECISE</b> <b>SCHEDULING</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>WARN</b> keyword allows precise control over advance warning in a more flexible  manner  than  the  <u>delta</u>
       mechanism.  It should be followed by the name of a user-defined function, <u>warn_function</u>.

       If  a  <u>warn_function</u>  is supplied, then it must take one argument of type <b>INT</b>.  <b>Remind</b> ignores any delta,
       and instead calls <u>warn_function</u> successively with the arguments 1, 2, 3, ...

       <u>Warn_function</u>'s return value <u>n</u> is interpreted as follows:

       o      If <u>n</u> is positive, then the reminder is triggered exactly <u>n</u> days before its trigger date.

       o      If <u>n</u> is negative, then it is triggered <u>n</u> days before its trigger date, <u>not</u> <u>counting</u> <b>OMIT</b>ted days.

       As an example, suppose you wish to be warned of American Independence Day 5, 3, and 1  days  in  advance.
       You could use this:

            FSET _wfun(x) choose(x, 5, 3, 1, 0)
            REM 4 July WARN _wfun MSG American Independence Day is %b.

       <b>NOTES</b>

       1      If an error occurs during the evaluation of <u>warn_function</u>, then <b>Remind</b> stops calling it and simply
              issues the reminder on its trigger date.

       2      If  the  absolute-values  of  the return values of <u>warn_function</u> are not monotonically decreasing,
              <b>Remind</b> stops calling it and issues the reminder on its trigger date.

       3      <u>Warn_function</u> should (as a matter of good style) return 0 as the final value in  its  sequence  of
              return  values.   However,  a reminder will <u>always</u> be triggered on its trigger date, regardless of
              what <u>warn_function</u> does.

       Similarly to <b>WARN</b>, the <b>SCHED</b> keyword allows precise control over the scheduling of timed  reminders.   It
       should be followed by the name of a user-defined function, <u>sched_function</u>.

       If  a scheduling function is supplied, then it must take one argument of type <b>INT</b>.  Rather than using the
       <b>AT</b> time, time <u>delta</u>, and time <u>repeat</u>, <b>Remind</b> calls the scheduling function to determine when  to  trigger
       the  reminder.  The first time the reminder is queued, the scheduling function is called with an argument
       of 1.  Each time the reminder is triggered, it is re-scheduled by calling the scheduling function  again.
       On each call, the argument is incremented by one.

       The  return  value  of  the scheduling function must be an <b>INT</b> or a <b>TIME</b>.  If the return value is a <b>TIME</b>,
       then the reminder is re-queued to trigger at that time.  If it is a positive integer <u>n</u>, then the reminder
       is re-queued to trigger at the previous trigger time plus <u>n</u>  minutes.   Finally,  if  it  is  a  negative
       integer or zero, then the reminder is re-queued to trigger <u>n</u> minutes before the <b>AT</b> time.  Note that there
       must be an <b>AT</b> clause for the <b>SCHED</b> clause to do anything.

       Here's an example:

            FSET _sfun(x) choose(x, -60, 30, 15, 10, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0)
            REM AT 13:00 SCHED _sfun MSG foo

       The  reminder  would  first be triggered at 13:00-60 minutes, or at 12:00.  It would next be triggered 30
       minutes later, at 12:30.  Then, it would be triggered at 12:45, 12:55, 12:58,  12:59,  13:00,  13:01  and
       13:02.

       <b>NOTES</b>

       1      If  an  error occurs during the evaluation of <u>sched_func</u>, then <b>Remind</b> reverts to using the <b>AT</b> time
              and the <u>delta</u> and <u>repeat</u> values, and never calls <u>sched_func</u> again.

       2      If processing <u>sched_func</u> yields a time earlier than the current  system  time,  it  is  repeatedly
              called with increasing argument until it yields a value greater than or equal to the current time.
              However,  if  the  sequence of values calculated during the repetition is not strictly increasing,
              then <b>Remind</b> reverts to the default behaviour and never calls <u>sched_func</u> again.

       3      It is quite possible using <u>sched_func</u> to keep  triggering  a  reminder  even  after  the  <b>AT</b>-time.
              However,  it  is  not  possible  to  reschedule  a  reminder  past  midnight - no crossing of date
              boundaries is allowed.  Also, it is quite possible to <b>not</b> trigger a reminder on the <b>AT</b>  time  when
              you  use a scheduling function.  However, if your scheduling function is terminated (for reasons 1
              and 2) before the <b>AT</b> time of the reminder, it <u>will</u> be triggered at the  <b>AT</b>  time,  because  normal
              processing takes over.

       4      Your  scheduling  functions should (as a matter of good style) return 0 when no more scheduling is
              required.  See the example.

       5      All scheduling functions are evaluated <u>after</u> the entire  Remind  script  has  been  read  in.   So
              whatever function definitions are in effect at the end of the script are used.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>SATISFY</b> <b>CLAUSE</b></h4><pre>
       The form of <b>REM</b> that uses <b>SATISFY</b> is as follows:

       <b>REM</b> <u>trigger</u> <b>SATISFY</b> <u>expr</u>

       The  way this works is as follows:  <b>Remind</b> first calculates a trigger date, in the normal fashion.  Next,
       it sets <b>trigdate()</b> to the calculated trigger date.  It then evaluates <u>expr</u>.  If the  result  is  not  the
       null  string  or  zero,  processing ends.  Otherwise, <b>Remind</b> computes the next trigger date, and re-tests
       <u>expr</u>.  This iteration continues until <u>expr</u> evaluates to non-zero or  non-null,  or  until  the  iteration
       limit specified with the <b>-x</b> command-line option is reached.

       If  <u>expr</u>  is not satisfied, then <b>trigvalid()</b> is set to 0 and the error message "Can't compute trigger" is
       issued.  Otherwise, <b>trigvalid()</b> is set to 1.

       This is really useful only if <u>expr</u> involves a call to the  <b>trigdate()</b>  or  related  functions  or  system
       variables;  otherwise,  <u>expr</u>  will not change as <b>Remind</b> iterates.  In fact, if <u>expr</u> is not a constant and
       does not call <b>trigdate()</b> or related functions or system variables, then <b>Remind</b> will issue a warning.

       An example of the usefulness of <b>SATISFY</b>:  Suppose you wish to be warned of every Friday the  13th.   Your
       first attempt may be:

            # WRONG!
            REM Fri 13 +2 MSG Friday the 13th is %b.

       But this won't work.  This reminder triggers on the first Friday on or after the 13th of each month.  The
       way to do it is with a more complicated sequence:

            REM 13 SATISFY wkdaynum(trigdate()) == 5
            IF trigvalid()
                 REM [trigdate()] +2 MSG \
                 Friday the 13th is %b.
            ENDIF

       You can write the REM statement a little more concisely:

            REM 13 SATISFY $Tw == 5

       Let's  see how this works.  The <b>SATISFY</b> clause iterates through all the 13ths of successive months, until
       a trigger date is found whose day-of-week is Friday (== 5).  If a  valid  date  was  found,  we  use  the
       calculated trigger date to set up the next reminder.

       We could also have written:

            REM Fri SATISFY day(trigdate()) == 13

       but this would result in more iterations, since "Fridays" occur more often than "13ths of the month."

       Here  is  another  example:  Suppose  you want to be reminded of something on the 15th of January, April,
       July, and October.  You could make four separate reminders, or you could use:

               REM 15 SATISFY [isany($Tm, 1, 4, 7, 10)] MSG 15th Reminder!

       This technique of using one <b>REM</b> command to calculate a trigger date to be  used  by  another  command  is
       quite  powerful.   For  example,  suppose  you  wanted  to  OMIT Labour day, which is the first Monday in
       September.  You could use:

            # Note: SATISFY 1 is an idiom for "do nothing"
            REM Mon 1 Sept SATISFY 1
            OMIT [trigdate()]

       <b>CAVEAT:</b> This <u>only</u> omits the <u>next</u> Labour Day, not all Labour Days in the future.  This could cause strange
       results, as the <b>OMIT</b> context can change depending on the current date.   For  example,  if  you  use  the
       following command after the above commands:

            REM Mon AFTER msg hello

       the result will not be as you expect.  Consider producing a calendar for September, 1992.  Labour Day was
       on Monday, 7 September, 1992.  However, when <b>Remind</b> gets around to calculating the trigger for Tuesday, 8
       September,  1992,  the <b>OMIT</b> command will now be omitting Labour Day for 1993, and the "Mon AFTER" command
       will not be triggered.  (But see the description of  <b>SCANFROM</b>  in  the  section  "DETAILS  ABOUT  TRIGGER
       COMPUTATION.")

       It  is  probably  best  to  stay away from computing <b>OMIT</b> trigger dates unless you keep these pitfalls in
       mind.

       For versions of <b>Remind</b> starting from 03.00.07, you can include a <b>MSG</b>,  <b>RUN</b>,  etc.  clause  in  a  <b>SATISFY</b>
       clause as follows:

            REM trigger_stuff SATISFY [expr] MSG body

       Note  that  for this case only, the <u>expr</u> after <b>SATISFY</b> <u>must</u> be enclosed in square brackets.  It must come
       after all the other components of the trigger, and immediately before the <b>MSG</b>,  <b>RUN</b>,  etc.  keyword.   If
       <u>expr</u> cannot be satisfied, then the reminder is not triggered.

       Thus, the "Friday the 13th" example can be expressed more compactly as:

            REM 13 +2 SATISFY [$Tw == 5] MSG Friday the 13th is %b.

       And you can trigger a reminder on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays occurring on odd-numbered days of the
       month with the following:

            REM Mon Wed Thu SATISFY [$Td %2 ] MSG Here it is!!!

       Note  that  <b>SATISFY</b>  and  <b>OMITFUNC</b> can often be used to solve the same problem, though in different ways.
       Sometimes a <b>SATISFY</b> is cleaner and sometimes an <b>OMITFUNC</b>; experiment and use whichever seems clearer.

</pre><h4><b>POSSIBLY-UNCOMPUTABLE</b> <b>TRIGGERS</b></h4><pre>
       Occasionally, you may wish to suppress the "Can't compute trigger" warnings for  reminders  for  which  a
       trigger  date  cannot  be computed.  For example, the following reminder is triggered on a Monday that is
       not a holiday if the following Tuesday is a holiday:

               REM Mon SKIP SATISFY [isomitted($T+1)] MSG Work between holidays

       However, if there are no Mondays after today's date that satisfy the condition,  Remind  will  print  the
       "Can't compute trigger" error.  To suppress this, use the <b>MAYBE-UNCOMPUTABLE</b> keyword:

               REM MAYBE-UNCOMPUTABLE Mon SKIP SATISFY [isomitted($T+1)] MSG Work between holidays

       It's almost never appropriate to use <b>MAYBE-UNCOMPUTABLE</b>, but it is provided for those rare occasions when
       it  makes  sense.   If  you  use  <b>MAYBE-UNCOMPUTABLE</b>  inside  the <b>evaltrig()</b> function, then untriggerable
       triggers return -1.  For example:

               SET a evaltrig("MAYBE-UNCOMPUTABLE Mon SKIP OMIT Mon")

       will set a to -1.

</pre><h4><b>DEBUGGING</b> <b>REMINDER</b> <b>SCRIPTS</b></h4><pre>
       Although the command-line <b>-d</b> option is useful for debugging, it is often overkill.  For example,  if  you
       turn  on  the  <b>-dx</b>  option for a reminder file with many complex expressions, you'll get a huge amount of
       output.  The <b>DEBUG</b> command allows you to control the debugging flags under program control.   The  format
       is:

       <b>DEBUG</b> [+<u>flagson</u>] [-<u>flagsoff</u>]

       <u>Flagson</u>  and  <u>flagsoff</u>  consist  of  strings of the characters "extvlfs" that correspond to the debugging
       options discussed in the command-line options section.  If preceded with a "+", the  corresponding  group
       of  debugging options is switched on.  Otherwise, they are switched off.  For example, you could use this
       sequence to debug a complicated expression:

            DEBUG +x
            set a <a href="../manmany_args/very_complex_expression.many_args.html">very_complex_expression</a>(many_args)
            DEBUG -x

       <b>THE</b> <b>DUMPVARS</b> <b>COMMAND</b>

       The command <b>DUMPVARS</b> displays the values of variables in memory.  Its format is:

       <b>DUMPVARS</b> [<u>var</u>...]

       If you supply a space-separated list of variable names, the corresponding variables  are  displayed.   If
       you  do  not  supply  a  list of variables, then all variables in memory are displayed.  To dump a system
       variable, put its name in the list of variables to dump.  If you put a lone dollar sign in  the  list  of
       variables to dump, then all system variables will be dumped.

       <b>THE</b> <b>ERRMSG</b> <b>COMMAND</b>

       The <b>ERRMSG</b> command has the following format:

       <b>ERRMSG</b> <u>body</u>

       The <u>body</u> is passed through the substitution filter (with an implicit trigger date of <b>today()</b>) and printed
       to the error output stream.  Example:

            IF !defined("critical_var")
                 ERRMSG You must supply a value for "critical_var"
                 EXIT
            ENDIF

       <b>THE</b> <b>EXIT</b> <b>COMMAND</b>

       The  above example also shows the use of the <b>EXIT</b> command.  This causes an unconditional exit from script
       processing.  Any queued timed reminders are discarded.  If you are in  calendar  mode  (described  next),
       then the calendar processing is aborted.

       If you supply an <b>INT</b>-type expression after the <b>EXIT</b> command, it is returned to the calling program as the
       exit status.  Otherwise, an exit status of 99 is returned.

       <b>THE</b> <b>FLUSH</b> <b>COMMAND</b>

       This  command  simply  consists  of the word <b>FLUSH</b> on a line by itself.  The command flushes the standard
       output and standard error streams used by <b>Remind</b>.  This is not terribly useful to most people, but may be
       useful if you run <b>Remind</b> as a subprocess of another program, and want to use pipes for communication.

</pre><h4><b>CALENDAR</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       If you supply the <b>-c</b>, <b>-s</b> or <b>-p</b> command-line option, then <b>Remind</b> runs in "calendar mode."  In  this  mode,
       <b>Remind</b>  interprets the script repeatedly, performing one iteration through the whole file for each day in
       the calendar.  Reminders that trigger are saved in internal buffers, and then inserted into the  calendar
       in the appropriate places.

       If you also supply the <b>-a</b> option, then <b>Remind</b> will not include timed reminders in the calendar.

       The  <b>-p</b> option is used in conjunction with the <b>Rem2PS</b> program to produce a calendar in PostScript format.
       For example, the following command will send PostScript code to standard output:

            remind -p .reminders | rem2ps

       You can print a PostScript calendar by piping this to the <b>lpr</b> command.

       If you have a reminder script called ".reminders", and you execute this command:

            remind -c .reminders jan 1993

       then <b>Remind</b> executes the script 31 times, once for each day  in  January.   Each  time  it  executes  the
       script, it increments the value of <b>today()</b>.  Any reminders whose trigger date matches <b>today()</b> are entered
       into the calendar.

       <b>MSG</b>  and  <b>CAL</b>-type  reminders,  by  default, have their entire body inserted into the calendar.  <b>RUN</b>-type
       reminders are not normally inserted into the calendar.  However, if you enclose a portion of the body  in
       the %"...%" sequence, only that portion is inserted.  For example, consider the following:

            REM 6 Jan MSG %"Dianne's birthday%" is %b

       In  the  normal  mode,  <b>Remind</b>  would  print  "Dianne's birthday is today" on 6 January.  However, in the
       calendar mode, only the text "Dianne's birthday" is inserted into the box for 6 January.

       If you explicitly use the %"...%" sequence in a <b>RUN</b>-type reminder, then the text between  the  delimiters
       is  inserted  into  the  calendar.   If  you use the sequence %"%" in a <b>MSG</b> or <b>CAL</b>-type reminder, then no
       calendar entry is produced for that reminder.

       <b>PRESERVING</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>

       Because <b>Remind</b> iterates through the script for each day in the calendar,  slow  operations  may  severely
       reduce the speed of producing a calendar.

       For example, suppose you set the variables "me" and "hostname" as follows:

            SET me shell("whoami")
            SET hostname shell("hostname")

       Normally, <b>Remind</b> clears all variables between iterations in calendar mode.  However, if certain variables
       are  slow  to  compute,  and will not change between iterations, you can "preserve" their values with the
       <b>PRESERVE</b> command.  Also, since function definitions are preserved between calendar iterations,  there  is
       no need to redefine them on each iteration.  Thus, you could use the following sequence:

            IF ! defined("initialized")
                 set initialized 1
                 set me shell("whoami")
                 set hostname shell("hostname")
                 fset func(x) complex_expr
                 preserve initialized me hostname
            ENDIF

       The  operation  is  as follows:  On the first iteration through the script, "initialized" is not defined.
       Thus, the commands between <b>IF</b> and <b>ENDIF</b> are executed.  The <b>PRESERVE</b> command ensures that  the  values  of
       initialized,  me  and  hostname  are  preserved  for  subsequent  iterations.  On the next iteration, the
       commands are skipped, since initialized has remained defined.  Thus, time-consuming  operations  that  do
       not depend on the value of <b>today()</b> are done only once.

       Most  system  variables  (those  whose names start with '$') are automatically preserved between calendar
       iterations.

       Note that for efficiency, <b>Remind</b> caches the reminder script (and  any  <b>INCLUDE</b>d  files)  in  memory  when
       producing a calendar.

       Timed  reminders  are sorted and placed into the calendar in time order.  These are followed by non-timed
       reminders.  <b>Remind</b> automatically places the time of timed reminders in the calendar according to  the  <b>-b</b>
       command-line  option.   Reminders  in calendar mode are sorted as if the <b>-g</b> option had been used; you can
       change the sort order in calendar mode by explicitly using the <b>-g</b> option to  specify  a  different  order
       from the default.

       <b>REPEATED</b> <b>EXECUTION</b>

       If  you  supply  a <u>repeat</u> parameter on the command line, and do not use the <b>-c</b>, <b>-p</b>, or <b>-s</b> options, <b>Remind</b>
       operates in a similar manner to calendar mode.  It repeatedly executes the reminder script,  incrementing
       <b>today()</b>  with  each iteration.  The same rules about preserving variables and function definitions apply.
       Note that using <u>repeat</u> on the command line also enables the <b>-q</b> option and disables any <b>-z</b> option.  As  an
       example, if you want to see how <b>Remind</b> will behave for the next week, you can type:

            remind .reminders '*7'

       If you want to print the dates of the next 1000 days, use:

            (echo 'banner %'; echo 'msg [today()]%') | remind - '*1000'

</pre><h4><b>INITIALIZING</b> <b>VARIABLES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>THE</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>-i</b>  option  is  used  to initialize variables on the <b>Remind</b> command line.  The format is <b>-i</b><u>var</u><b>=</b><u>expr</u>,
       where <u>expr</u> is any valid expression.  Note that you may have to use quotes or escapes to prevent the shell
       from interpreting special characters in <u>expr</u>.  You can have as many <b>-i</b> options as you want on the command
       line, and they are processed in order.  Thus, if a variable is defined  in  one  <b>-i</b>  option,  it  can  be
       referred to by subsequent <b>-i</b> options.

       Note  that  if  you  supply  a  date  on  the  command line, it is not parsed until all options have been
       processed.  Thus, if you use <b>today()</b> in any of the <b>-i</b> expressions, it  will  return  the  same  value  as
       <b>realtoday()</b> and not the date supplied on the command line.

       Any variables defined on the command line are <b>preserved</b> as with the <b>PRESERVE</b> command.

       You  should  not  have  any  spaces between the <b>-i</b> option and the equal sign; otherwise, strange variable
       names are created that can only be accessed with the <b>value()</b> or <b>defined()</b> functions.

       You can also define a function on the command line by using:

       <b>-i</b><u>func</u>(<u>args</u>)=<u>definition</u>

       Be sure to protect special characters from shell interpretation.

</pre><h4><b>MORE</b> <b>ABOUT</b> <b>POSTSCRIPT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>PS</b> and <b>PSFILE</b> reminders pass PostScript code directly to the printer.  They differ in  that  the  <b>PS</b>-
       type  reminder  passes  its  body directly to the PostScript output (after processing by the substitution
       filter) while the <b>PSFILE</b>-type's body should simply consist of a filename.  The <b>Rem2PS</b> program  will  open
       the file named in the <b>PSFILE</b>-type reminder, and include its contents in the PostScript output.

       The  PostScript-type reminders for a particular day are included in the PostScript output in sorted order
       of priority.  Note that the order of PostScript commands has a <u>major</u> impact  on  the  appearance  of  the
       calendars.   For  example,  PostScript  code  to shade a calendar box will obliterate code to draw a moon
       symbol if the moon symbol code is placed in the calendar first.  For this reason, you should not  provide
       <b>PS</b>  or <b>PSFILE</b>-type reminders with priorities; instead, you should ensure that they appear in the reminder
       script in the correct order.  PostScript code should draw objects working  from  the  background  to  the
       foreground,  so  that  foreground  objects  properly  overlay  background  ones.  If you prioritize these
       reminders and run the script using descending sort order for priorities, the PostScript output  will  not
       work.

       All of the PostScript code for a particular date is enclosed in a <b>save</b>-<b>restore</b> pair.  However, if several
       PostScript-type reminders are triggered for a single day, each section of PostScript is not enclosed in a
       <b>save</b>-<b>restore</b> pair - instead, the entire body of included PostScript is enclosed.

       PostScript-type  reminders  are  executed  by the PostScript printer before any regular calendar entries.
       Thus, regular calendar entries will overlay the PostScript-type reminders, allowing you to create  shaded
       or graphical backgrounds for particular days.

       Before  executing  your  PostScript code, the origin of the PostScript coordinate system is positioned to
       the bottom left-hand corner of the "box" in the calendar representing <b>today()</b>.  This location is  exactly
       in  the  middle of the intersection of the bottom and left black lines delineating the box - you may have
       to account for the thickness of these lines when calculating positions.

       Several PostScript variables are available to the PostScript code you  supply.   All  distance  and  size
       variables are in PostScript units (1/72 inch.)  The variables are:

       LineWidth
              The width of the black grid lines making up the calendar.

       Border The  border  between  the  center  of the grid lines and the space used to print calendar entries.
              This border is normally blank space.

       BoxWidth and BoxHeight
              The width and height of the calendar box, from center-to-center of the black gridlines.

       InBoxHeight
              The height from the center of the bottom black gridline to the top of the regular  calendar  entry
              area.  The space from here to the top of the box is used only to draw the day number.

       /DayFont, /EntryFont, /SmallFont, /TitleFont and /HeadFont
              The  fonts  used  to draw the day numbers, the calendar entries, the small calendars, the calendar
              title (month, year) and the day-of-the-week headings, respectively.

       DaySize, EntrySize, TitleSize and HeadSize
              The sizes of the above fonts.  (The size of the small calendar font is  <u>not</u>  defined  here.)   For
              example,  if  you  wanted to print the Hebrew date next to the regular day number in the calendar,
              use:

            REM PS Border BoxHeight Border sub DaySize sub moveto \
               /DayFont findfont DaySize scalefont setfont \
               ([hebday(today())] [hebmon(today())]) show

              Note how /DayFont and DaySize are used.

       Note that if you supply PostScript code, it is possible to produce invalid PostScript files.  Always test
       your PostScript thoroughly with a PostScript viewer before sending it to the printer.  You should not use
       any document structuring comments in your PostScript code.

</pre><h4><b>DAEMON</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       If you use the <b>-z</b> command-line option, <b>Remind</b> runs in "daemon mode".  In this mode, no "normal" reminders
       are issued.  Instead, only timed reminders are collected and queued, and are then  issued  whenever  they
       reach their trigger time.

       In addition, <b>Remind</b> wakes up every few minutes to check the modification date on the reminder script (the
       filename  supplied  on  the command line.)  If <b>Remind</b> detects that the script has changed, it re-executes
       itself in daemon mode, and interprets the changed script.   If  <b>Remind</b>  was  compiled  with  support  for
       <b><a href="../man7/inotify.7.html">inotify</a></b>(7),  then  if  the  command-line  reminder  script is really a directory, <b>Remind</b> also re-executes
       itself if any of the files in the directory is changed.

       In daemon mode, <b>Remind</b> also re-reads the remind script when it detects that the system date has changed.

       In daemon mode, <b>Remind</b> acts as if the <b>-f</b> option  had  been  used,  so  to  run  in  daemon  mode  in  the
       background, use:

            remind -z .reminders &amp;

       If  you  use  <b>sh</b> or <b>bash</b>, you may have to use the "nohup" command to ensure that the daemon is not killed
       when you log out.

</pre><h4><b>PURGE</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       If you supply the <b>-j</b> command-line option, <b>Remind</b> runs in <u>purge</u> <u>mode</u>.  In this mode,  it  tries  to  purge
       expired reminders from your reminder files.

       In  purge  mode,  <b>Remind</b>  reads  your  reminder file and creates a new file by appending ".purged" to the
       original file name.  Note that <b>Remind</b> <u>never</u> edits your original file; it always  creates  a  new  .purged
       file.

       If you invoke <b>Remind</b> against a directory instead of a file, then a .purged file is created for each *.rem
       file in the directory.

       Normally,  <b>Remind</b>  does  not  create  .purged files for INCLUDed files.  However, if you supply a numeric
       argument after <b>-j</b>, then <b>Remind</b> will create .purged  files  for  the  specified  level  of  INCLUDE.   For
       example,  if you invoke <b>Remind</b> with the argument <b>-j2</b>, then .purged files will be created for the file (or
       directory) specified on the command line, any files included by them, and any  files  included  by  those
       files.  However, .purged files will not be created for third-or-higher level INCLUDE files.

       Determining  which  reminders  have  expired  is  extremely tricky.  <b>Remind</b> does its best, but you should
       always compare the .purged file to the original file and hand-merge the changes back in.

       Remind annotates the .purged file as follows:

       An expired reminder is prefixed with:  #!P: Expired:

       In situations where <b>Remind</b> cannot reliably  determine  that  something  was  expired,  you  may  see  the
       following comments inserted before the problematic line:

          #!P: Cannot purge SATISFY-type reminders

          #!P: The next IF evaluated false...
          #!P: REM statements in IF block not checked for purging.

          #!P: The previous IF evaluated true.
          #!P: REM statements in ELSE block not checked for purging

          #!P: The next IFTRIG did not trigger.
          #!P: REM statements in IFTRIG block not checked for purging.

          #!P: Next line has expired, but contains expression...  please verify

          #!P: Next line may have expired, but contains non-constant expression

          #!P! Could not parse next line: Some-Error-Message-Here

       <b>Remind</b>  always annotates .purged files with lines beginning with "#!P".  If such lines are encountered in
       the <u>original</u> file, they are not copied to the .purged file.

</pre><h4><b>SORTING</b> <b>REMINDERS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-g</b> option causes <b>Remind</b> to sort reminders by trigger date, time and  priority  before  issuing  them.
       Note  that  reminders  are still calculated in the order encountered in the script.  However, rather than
       being issued immediately, they are saved in an internal buffer.  When <b>Remind</b> has finished processing  the
       script,  it  issues  the  saved  reminders  in sorted order.  The <b>-g</b> option can be followed by up to four
       characters that must all be "a" or "d".  The first character specifies the sort  order  by  trigger  date
       (ascending  or  descending),  the second specifies the sort order by trigger time and the third specifies
       the sort order by priority.  If the fourth character is "d", the  untimed  reminders  are  sorted  before
       timed  reminders.   The  default  is  to sort all fields in ascending order and to sort untimed reminders
       after timed reminders.

       In ascending order, reminders are issued with the most imminent first.  Descending order is the  reverse.
       Reminders  are always sorted by trigger date, and reminders with the same trigger date are then sorted by
       trigger time.  If two reminders have the same date and time, then the priority is  used  to  break  ties.
       Reminders with the same date, time and priority are issued in the order they were encountered.

       You  can  define  a  user-defined  function called SORTBANNER that takes one <b>DATE</b>-type argument.  In sort
       mode, the following sequence happens:

       If <b>Remind</b> notices that the next reminder to issue has a different trigger date from the previous one  (or
       if  it  is  the first one to be issued), then SORTBANNER is called with the trigger date as its argument.
       The result is coerced to a string, and passed  through  the  substitution  filter  with  the  appropriate
       trigger date.  The result is then displayed.

       Here's an example - consider the following fragment:

            # Switch off the normal banner
            BANNER %
            REM 11 March 1993 ++1 MSG Not so important
            REM 17 March 1993 ++7 MSG Way in the future
            REM 10 March 1993 MSG Important Reminder
            REM 11 March 1993 ++1 MSG Not so important - B
            FSET sortbanner(x) iif(x == today(), \
                 "***** THINGS TO DO TODAY *****", \
                 "----- Things to do %b -----")

       Running this with the <b>-gaa</b> option on 10 March 1993 produces the following output:

            ***** THINGS TO DO TODAY *****

            Important Reminder

            ----- Things to do tomorrow -----

            Not so important

            Not so important - B

            ----- Things to do in 7 days' time -----

            Way in the future

       You  can use the <b>args()</b> built-in function to determine whether or not SORTBANNER has been defined.  (This
       could be used, for example, to provide a default definition for SORTBANNER in a system-wide file included
       at the end of the user's file.)  Here's an example:

            # Create a default sortbanner function if it hasn't already
            # been defined
            if args("sortbanner") != 1
                 fset sortbanner(x) "--- Things to do %b ---"
            endif

</pre><h4><b>MSGPREFIX()</b> <b>AND</b> <b>MSGSUFFIX()</b></h4><pre>
       You can define two functions in your script called <b>msgprefix()</b> and <b>msgsuffix()</b>.  They should each  accept
       one argument, a number from 0 to 9999.

       In  normal  mode,  for  <b>MSG</b>- and <b>MSF</b>-type reminders, the following sequence occurs when <b>Remind</b> triggers a
       reminder:

       o      If <b>msgprefix()</b> is defined, it is evaluated with the priority of the reminder as its argument.  The
              result is printed.  It is <u>not</u> passed through the substitution filter.

       o      The body of the reminder is printed.

       o      If <b>msgsuffix()</b> is defined, it is evaluated with the priority of the reminder as its argument.  The
              result is printed.  It is <u>not</u> passed through the substitution filter.

       Here's an example:  The following definition causes priority-0 reminders to be preceded by "URGENT",  and
       priority-6000 reminders to be preceded by "(not important)".

            fset msgprefix(x) iif(x==0, "URGENT: ", \
                 x==6000, "(not important) ", "")

       In  Calendar  Mode  (with the <b>-c</b>, <b>-s</b> or <b>-p</b> options), an analogous pair of functions named <b>calprefix()</b> and
       <b>calsuffix()</b> can be defined.  They work with all reminders that produce an entry in  the  calendar  (i.e.,
       <b>CAL</b>- and possibly <b>RUN</b>-type reminders as well as <b>MSG</b>-type reminders.)

       <b>NOTES</b>

       Normally, the body of a reminder is followed by a carriage return.  Thus, the results of <b>msgsuffix()</b> will
       appear  on  the  next  line.   If  you  don't  want this, make sure the output of <b>msgsuffix</b> begins with a
       backspace.  This places the suffix  <u>before</u>  rather  than  after  the  carriage  return.   (The  backspace
       character itself is stripped out.)  Here is an example:

               FSET msgsuffix(x) <a href="../man8/char.8.html">char</a>(8) + " - suffix on same line"

       If  <b>Remind</b>  has problems evaluating <b>msgprefix()</b>, <b>msgsuffix()</b> or <b>sortbanner()</b>, you will see a lot of error
       messages.  For an example of this, define the following:

            fset msgprefix(x) x/0

</pre><h4><b>COMPILE-TIME</b> <b>SUPPORT</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>LANGUAGES</b></h4><pre>
       Remind used  to  support  compile-time  localization  to  other  languages,  but  no  longer  does.   All
       localization is now done at run-time.

</pre><h4><b>RUN-TIME</b> <b>SUPPORT</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>LANGUAGES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Remind</b>  has  run-time support for other languages, and compile-time support has been removed in favour of
       run-time support.

       A number of system variables let  you  translate  various  phrases  to  other  languages.   These  system
       variables are:

       <b>$Monday,</b> <b>$Tuesday,</b> <b>$Wednesday,</b> <b>$Thursday,</b> <b>$Friday,</b> <b>$Saturday,</b> <b>$Sunday</b>
              Set  each  of these system variables to a string representing the corresponding day's name in your
              language.  Strings must be valid UTF-8 strings.

       <b>$January,</b> <b>$February,</b> <b>$March,</b> <b>$April,</b> <b>$May,</b> <b>$June,</b> <b>$July,</b> <b>$August,</b> <b>$September,</b> <b>$October,</b> <b>$November,</b>
       <b>$December</b>
              Set each of these system variables to a string representing the corresponding month's name in your
              language.  Strings must be valid UTF-8 strings.

       <b>$Ago,</b> <b>$Am,</b> <b>$And,</b> <b>$At,</b> <b>$Hour,</b> <b>$Is,</b> <b>$Minute,</b> <b>$Now,</b> <b>$On,</b> <b>$Pm,</b> <b>$Today,</b> <b>$Tomorrow,</b> <b>$Was</b>
              Set each of these system variables to the translation of the corresponding English word into  your
              language.   Note  that  <b>$Am</b>  and  <b>$Pm</b>  should  be  the  translations of "AM" and "PM" (morning and
              afternoon time indicators) respectively.

       <b>$Hplu,</b> <b>$Mplu</b>
              Set these to the suffix to add to the word for "hour"  and  "minute"  to  make  them  plural.   In
              English, both would be set to "s".

       <b>$Fromnow</b>
              Set this to the translation of the English phrase "from now"

       Note  that  if  you  set any of the language-related system variables, they should be set in a section of
       your script that always is evaluated.  If you set them inside an <b>IF</b> statement, for example,  results  are
       unpredictable.

       Note  also  that  the <b>Rem2PS</b> back-end does not support the full range of UTF-8 characters.  The <b>TkRemind</b>,
       <b>rem2html</b> and <b>rem2pdf</b> back-ends all do support the full UTF-8 range.

</pre><h4><b>RUN-TIME</b> <b>MODIFICATION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>SUBSTITUTION</b> <b>FILTER</b></h4><pre>
       The system variables mentioned in the previous section are not typically sufficient to properly translate
       Remind's output to another language.  Some languages have complicated rules for AM vs PM times and others
       have complex rules for making words plural.  <b>Remind</b> therefore allows you to define a number of  functions
       that modify the behavior of the substitution filter at run-time.  The functions are:

       <b>subst_ampm(h)</b>
              This  function is passed a single integer, namely an hour from 0 to 23.  It should return a string
              that indicates "AM" or "PM" or even finer gradations in some languages.

       <b>subst_ordinal(d)</b>
              This function is passed a single integer, namely a day of the month  from  1  to  31.   It  should
              return a string that is suffixed to the day number to turn it into an ordinal number.  In English,
              for example, the function might return "st", "nd", "rd" or "th", depending on <u>d</u>.

       <b>subst_</b><u>N</u><b>(alt,</b> <b>date,</b> <b>time)</b>
              This  is  actually a <u>family</u> of functions, where <u>N</u> is a letter or number.  This function <u>completely</u>
              <u>overrides</u> the substitution sequence "%N".  The three arguments are an integer <u>alt</u> which,  if  non-
              zero, indicates that the alternate-mode substitution sequence "%*N" was encountered; <u>date</u> which is
              the trigger date of the reminder and <u>time</u> which is the trigger time.

       <b>subst_</b><u>N</u><b>x(alt,</b> <b>date,</b> <b>time)</b>
              Again,  this  is  a  <u>family</u>  of  functions.  It is similar to the <b>subst_</b><u>N</u> family except it is only
              called if <u>date</u> is two or more days away from <u>today()</u>.   This  is  useful  if  you  don't  want  to
              override the "today" or "tomorrow" output for most substitution sequences.

       Here's  an  example  of how you might customize your substitution filter.  Suppose you want to change the
       "%b" sequence to substitute "the day after tomorrow" for an event two days from now.  You could do this:

           FSET subst_bx(a,d,t) iif(d==today()+2, "the day after tomorrow", \
                                    "in " + (d-today()) + " days' time")
           REM [today()+3] ++3 MSG Event 1 is %b%
           REM [today()+2] ++3 MSG Event 2 is %b%
           REM [today()+1] ++3 MSG Event 3 is %b%
           REM [today()]   ++3 MSG Event 4 is %b%

       The output of this script is:

           Event 1 is in 3 days' time
           Event 2 is the day after tomorrow
           Event 3 is tomorrow
           Event 4 is today

       Note how Event 2's wording was changed from the normal  "in  2  days'  time",  and  note  also  that  the
       "tomorrow"  and  "today" events used the normal substitution---<b>subst_bx</b> is not called for trigger days of
       today or tomorrow.

       As a special case, if a  <b>subst_Nx</b>  <b>or</b>  <b>subst_N</b>  function  returns  the  integer  zero,  then  the  normal
       substitution mechanism is used.  Therefore, the previous example could have been written more simply as:

           FSET subst_bx(a,d,t) iif(d==today()+2, "the day after tomorrow", 0)

       You  can  define  your  own  substitution  sequences in addition to the built-in ones as follows:  If you
       define a function named <b>subst_</b><u>name</u><b>(alt,</b> <b>date,</b> <b>time)</b>, then the sequence <b>%{name}</b> calls  the  function  with
       <b>alt</b>  set  to  0  and  <b>date</b>  and <b>time</b> to the trigger date and time, respectively.  The <b>%{name}</b> sequence is
       replaced with whatever the function returns.  The sequence <b>%*{name}</b> is similar, but  calls  the  function
       with <b>alt</b> set to 1.

       If  you  use  a  <b>%{name}</b>  sequence  and  the function <b>subst_</b><u>name</u> is not defined or returns an error, then
       <b>%{name}</b> is replaced with the empty string.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>TRANSLATION</b> <b>TABLE</b></h4><pre>
       To assist with localizing reminder files, <b>Remind</b> maintains a table of translations.   This  is  simple  a
       lookup  table  that  maps one string (the original string) to a new string (the translated string.)  When
       <b>Remind</b> starts executing, the translation table is empty.

       To add a message to the translation table, use the <b>TRANSLATE</b> command (which may be abbreviated to <b>TRANS</b>.)
       The <b>TRANSLATE</b> command must be followed by two quoted strings, separated from  each  other  and  from  the
       command by whitespace.  For example, a Dutch language file might contain something like this:

               TRANSLATE "New Moon" "Nieuwe maan"
               TRANSLATE "First Quarter" "Eerste kwartier"
               TRANSLATE "Full Moon" "Volle maan"
               TRANSLATE "Last Quarter" "Laatste kwartier"

       To actually use the translation table, make use of the <b>_</b> built-in function, as follows:

               REM NOQUEUE [<a href="../man0/moondatetime.0.html">moondatetime</a>(0)] MSG [_("New Moon")] (%2)
               REM NOQUEUE [<a href="../man1/moondatetime.1.html">moondatetime</a>(1)] MSG [_("First Quarter")] (%2)
               REM NOQUEUE [<a href="../man2/moondatetime.2.html">moondatetime</a>(2)] MSG [_("Full Moon")] (%2)
               REM NOQUEUE [<a href="../man3/moondatetime.3.html">moondatetime</a>(3)] MSG [_("Last Quarter")] (%2)

       By using <b>TRANSLATE</b> and <b>_</b> judiciously, you can make your reminder files easy to translate.

       <b>TRANSLATE</b>  has four additional forms:  If it is followed by <u>one</u> quoted string instead of two, then <b>Remind</b>
       deletes the translation table entry for that string.  If it is followed by the keyword <b>DUMP</b>, then  <b>Remind</b>
       dumps  all  translation  table  entries  to standard output.  And if it is followed by <b>CLEAR</b>, then <b>Remind</b>
       deletes all of the translation table entries.

       The fourth form, <b>TRANSLATE</b> <b>GENERATE</b>, dumps all of the strings that can  be  localized  (as  a  series  of
       TRANSLATE  commands)  to  standard  output.   Strings  that  are  already localized are output with their
       localization; strings that are not localized are output as:

               TRANSLATE "untranslated" ""

       If you want to add a new language, you can obtain a skeleton translation
       file by running:

               echo "TRANSLATE GENERATE" | remind -h - &gt; /tmp/skeleton.rem

       If you have an existing language file that is missing some translations, you can update it by running:

               (echo INCLUDE mylang.rem; echo TRANSLATE GENERATE) | \
                   remind -h - &gt; /tmp/mylang-update.rem

       and then editing <b>mylang-update.rem</b> to add in the missing translations.

       If you have some reminder scripts that use the <b>_()</b> built-in function or <b>%(...)</b> substitution sequence, you
       can generate a list of needed TRANSLATE commands by running:

               remind -q -n -dq myscript.rem 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep ^TRANSLATE | sort | uniq

       Note that if you <b>SET</b> various translation-related system variables such as <b>$Monday</b>, <b>$December</b>, <b>$Ago</b>,  etc,
       then  <b>Remind</b>  <u>also</u>  makes a corresponding translation table entry automatically.  This is done for all of
       the translation-related system variables <u>except</u> <u>for</u> <b>$Hplu</b> and <b>$Mplu</b>.

       The converse applies too; creating a translation table for "December" automatically sets <b>$December</b>.   And
       if  you  invoke  <b>TRANSLATE</b>  <b>CLEAR</b>, then all translation-related system variables are set to their default
       values as well.

       The translation table always contains a special entry <b>LANGID</b> whose default value is <b>en</b>.  Translators  are
       encouraged  to add a <b>LANGID</b> entry in their language files; the value should be the two-characters ISO 639
       language code.

       For example, if you write a translation file for the Dutch language, add this line:

               TRANSLATE "LANGID" "nl"

       Scripts can use <b>_("LANGID")</b> to query the translation language that is in effect.

       The <b>_()</b> function uses the following procedure to obtain the translation for a string:

              1      Look for an exact match.  If found, return.

              2      If the original string had an upper-case letter, search for the all-lower-case  equivalent.
                     If found, make the first letter of the result upper-case and return.

              3      If  the  original  string  started with a lower-case letter, search for an equivalent whose
                     first letter is upper-case and the rest lower-case.  If found, make the first letter of the
                     result lower-case and return.

              4      No translation was found.  Return the original string.

</pre><h4><b>LANGUAGE</b> <b>PACKS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Remind</b>  ships  with  a  number  of  language  packs,  which  are  simply  reminder  scripts  located   in
       <b>[$SysInclude]/lang</b>.  The currently-shipping language packs are:

       da.rem  (Danish),  de.rem  (German),  es.rem  (Spanish),  fr.rem  (French),  is.rem  (Icelandic),  it.rem
       (Italian),  nl.rem  (Dutch),  no.rem  (Norwegian),  pl.rem  (Polish),  pt.rem  (Portuguese)  and   ro.rem
       (Romanian).

       To use a language pack (in this example, de.rem), simply place this at the top of your reminders file:

           SYSINCLUDE lang/de.rem

       If you want <b>Remind</b> to try to find the language pack appropriate for your locale settings, use:

           SYSINCLUDE lang/auto.rem

       You are encouraged to study the language packs to see how to translate Remind into additional languages.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>HEBREW</b> <b>CALENDAR</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Remind</b>  has  support  for the Hebrew calendar, which is a luni-solar calendar.  This allows you to create
       reminders for Jewish holidays, jahrzeits (anniversaries of deaths) and smachot (joyous occasions.)

       <b>THE</b> <b>HEBREW</b> <b>YEAR</b>

       The Hebrew year has 12 months, alternately 30 and 29  days  long.   The  months  are:  Tishrey,  Heshvan,
       Kislev,  Tevet, Shvat, Adar, Nisan, Iyar, Sivan, Tamuz, Av and Elul.  In Biblical times, the year started
       in Nisan, but Rosh Hashana (Jewish New Year) is now celebrated on the 1st and 2nd of Tishrey.

       In a cycle of 19 years, there are 7 leap years, being years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 19 of the cycle.   In
       a leap year, an extra month of 30 days is added before Adar.  The two Adars are called Adar A and Adar B.

       For  certain  religious  reasons,  the year cannot start on a Sunday, Wednesday or Friday.  To adjust for
       this, a day is taken off Kislev or added to Heshvan.  Thus, a regular year can have from 353 to 355 days,
       and a leap year from 383 to 385.

       When Kislev or Heshvan is short, it is called <u>chaser</u>, or lacking.  When it is long, it is called  <u>shalem</u>,
       or full.

       The  Jewish date changes at sunset.  However, <b>Remind</b> will change the date at midnight, not sunset.  So in
       the period between sunset and midnight, Remind will be a day earlier than the  true  Jewish  date.   This
       should not be much of a problem in practice.

       The  computations for the Jewish calendar were based on the program "hdate" written by Amos Shapir of the
       Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.  He also supplied the preceding explanation of the calendar.

       <b>HEBREW</b> <b>DATE</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b>

       <b>hebday(d_date)</b>
              Returns the day of the Hebrew month corresponding to the <u>date</u> parameter.  For  example,  12  April
              1993 corresponds to 21 Nisan 5753.  Thus, hebday('1993/04/12') returns 21.

       <b>hebmon(d_date)</b>
              Returns  the  name  of  the Hebrew month corresponding to <u>date</u>.  For example, hebmon('1993/04/12')
              returns "Nisan".

       <b>hebyear(d_date)</b>
              Returns the Hebrew year corresponding to <u>date</u>.  For example, hebyear('1993/04/12') returns 5753.

       <b>hebdate(i_day,</b> <b>s_hebmon</b> <b>[,id_yrstart</b> <b>[,i_jahr</b> <b>[,i_aflag]]])</b>
              The <b>hebdate()</b> function is the most complex of the Hebrew support functions.  It can take from 2 to
              5 arguments.  It returns a <b>DATE</b> corresponding to the Hebrew date.

              The <u>day</u> parameter can range from 1 to 30, and specifies the day of the Hebrew month.   The  <u>hebmon</u>
              parameter  is  a  string  that  must name one of the Hebrew months specified above.  Note that the
              month must be spelled out in full, and use the English transliteration shown previously.  You  can
              also specify "Adar A" and "Adar B."  Month names are not case-sensitive.

              The  <u>yrstart</u>  parameter can either be a <b>DATE</b> or an <b>INT</b>.  If it is a <b>DATE</b>, then the <b>hebdate()</b> scans
              for the first Hebrew date on or after that date.  For example:

                        hebdate(15, "Nisan", '1990/01/01')

              returns 1990/03/30, because that is the first occurrence of 15 Nisan on or after 1 January 1990.

              If <u>yrstart</u> is an <b>INT</b>, it is interpreted as a Hebrew year.  Thus:

                        hebdate(22, "Kislev", 5756)

              returns 1995/12/15, because that date corresponds to 22 Kislev,  5756.   Note  that  none  of  the
              Hebrew date functions will work with dates outside <b>Remind's</b> normal range for dates.

              If <u>yrstart</u> is not supplied, it defaults to <b>today()</b>.

              The <u>jahr</u> modifies the behaviour of <b>hebdate()</b> as follows:

              If  <u>jahr</u>  is  0  (the  default),  then <b>hebdate()</b> keeps scanning until it finds a date that exactly
              satisfies the other parameters.  For example:

                        hebdate(30, "Adar A", 1993/01/01)

              returns 1995/03/02, corresponding to 30 Adar A, 5755, because that is the next  occurrence  of  30
              Adar  A  after 1 January, 1993.  This behaviour is appropriate for Purim Katan, which only appears
              in leap years.

              If <u>jahr</u> is 1, then the date is modified as follows:

              o      30 Heshvan is converted to 1 Kislev in years when Heshvan is <u>chaser</u>

              o      30 Kislev is converted to 1 Tevet in years when Kislev is <u>chaser</u>

              o      30 Adar A is converted to 1 Nisan in non-leapyears

              o      Other dates in Adar A are moved to the corresponding day in Adar in non-leapyears

              This behaviour is appropriate for  smachot  (joyous  occasions)  and  for  some  jahrzeits  -  see
              "JAHRZEITS."

              if <u>jahr</u> is 2, then the date is modified as follows:

              o      30  Kislev  and  30 Heshvan are converted to 29 Kislev and 29 Heshvan, respectively, if the
                     month is <u>chaser</u>

              o      30 Adar A is converted to 30 Shvat in non-leapyears

              o      Other dates in Adar A are moved to the corresponding day in Adar in non-leapyears

              if <u>jahr</u> is not 0, 1, or 2, it is interpreted as a Hebrew year, and the behaviour is calculated  as
              described in the next section, "JAHRZEITS."

              The  <u>aflag</u>  parameter  modifies the behaviour of the function for dates in Adar during leap years.
              The <u>aflag</u> is <u>only</u> used if <u>yrstart</u> is a <b>DATE</b> type.

              The <u>aflag</u> only affects date calculations if <u>hebmon</u> is specified as "Adar".   In  leap  years,  the
              following algorithm is followed:

              o      If <u>aflag</u> is 0, then the date is triggered in Adar B.  This is the default.

              o      If <u>aflag</u> is 1, then the date is triggered in Adar A.  This may be appropriate for jahrzeits
                     in the Ashkenazi tradition; consult a rabbi.

              o      If  <u>aflag</u>  is 2, then the date is triggered in both Adar A and Adar B of a leap year.  Some
                     Ashkenazim perform jahrzeit in both Adar A and Adar B.

       <b>JAHRZEITS</b>

       A jahrzeit is a yearly commemoration of someone's death.  It normally takes place on the  anniversary  of
       the death, but may be delayed if burial is delayed - consult a rabbi for more information.

       In  addition,  because  some months change length, it is not obvious which day the anniversary of a death
       is.  The following rules are used:

       o      If the death occurred on 30 Heshvan, and Heshvan in the year after the death is <u>chaser</u>,  then  the
              jahrzeit  is  observed  on 29 Heshvan in years when Heshvan is <u>chaser</u>.  Otherwise, the jahrzeit is
              observed on 1 Kislev when Heshvan is <u>chaser</u>.

       o      If the death occurred on 30 Kislev, and Kislev in the year after the death  is  <u>chaser</u>,  then  the
              jahrzeit  is  observed  on  29  Kislev in years when Kislev is <u>chaser</u>.  Otherwise, the jahrzeit is
              observed on 1 Tevet when Kislev is <u>chaser</u>.

       o      If the death occurred on 1-29 Adar A, it is observed on 1-29 Adar in non-leapyears.

       o      If the death occurred on 30 Adar A, it is observed on 30 Shvat in a non-leapyear.

       Specifying a Hebrew year for the <u>jahr</u> parameter causes the correct behaviour to be selected for  a  death
       in that year.  You may also have to specify <u>aflag</u>, depending on your tradition.

       The  jahrzeit information was supplied by Frank Yellin, who quoted "The Comprehensive Hebrew Calendar" by
       Arthur Spier, and "Calendrical Calculations" by E. M. Reingold and Nachum Dershowitz.

</pre><h4><b>OUT-OF-BAND</b> <b>REMINDERS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>SPECIAL</b> keyword is used to transmit "out-of-band" information to <b>Remind</b> backends, such as <b>tkremind</b> or
       <b>Rem2PS</b>.  They are used only when piping data from a <b>remind</b> <b>-p</b> line.  (Note that the COLOR special  is  an
       exception; it downgrades to the equivalent of MSG in <b>Remind's</b> normal mode of operation.)

       The  various  <b>SPECIAL</b>s  recognized are particular for each backend; however, there are four <b>SPECIAL</b>s that
       all backends should attempt to support.  They are currently supported by <b>Rem2PS</b>, <b>tkremind</b> and <b>rem2html</b>.

       The <b>SHADE</b> special replaces the <b>psshade()</b> function.  Use it like this:

            REM Sat Sun SPECIAL SHADE 128
            REM Mon SPECIAL SHADE 255 0 0

       The <b>SHADE</b> keyword is followed by either one or three numbers, from 0 to 255.  If one number is  supplied,
       it  is  interpreted  as a grey-scale value from black (0) to white (255).  If three numbers are supplied,
       they are interpreted as RGB components from minimum (0) to  maximum  (255).   The  example  above  shades
       weekends a fairly dark grey and makes Mondays a fully-saturated red.  (These shadings appear in calendars
       produced by <b>Rem2PS</b>, <b>tkremind</b> and <b>rem2html</b>.)

       The <b>MOON</b> special replaces the <b>psmoon()</b> function.  Use it like this:

            REM [<a href="../man0/moondate.0.html">moondate</a>(0)] SPECIAL MOON 0
            REM [<a href="../man1/moondate.1.html">moondate</a>(1)] SPECIAL MOON 1
            REM [<a href="../man2/moondate.2.html">moondate</a>(2)] SPECIAL MOON 2
            REM [<a href="../man3/moondate.3.html">moondate</a>(3)] SPECIAL MOON 3

       These draw little moons on the various calendars.  The complete syntax of the <b>MOON</b> special is as follows:

            ... SPECIAL MOON phase moonsize fontsize msg

       <u>Phase</u>  is  a number from 0 to 3, with 0 representing a new moon, 1 the first quarter, 2 a full moon and 3
       the last quarter.

       <u>moonsize</u> is the diameter in PostScript units of the moon to draw.  If omitted  or  supplied  as  -1,  the
       backend chooses an appropriate size.

       <u>fontsize</u> is the font size in PostScript units of the <u>msg</u>

       <u>Msg</u> is additional text that is placed near the moon glyph.

       Note that only the <b>Rem2PS</b> backend supports <u>moonsize</u> and <u>fontsize</u>; the other backends use fixed sizes.

       The <b>COLOR</b> special lets you place colored reminders in the calendar.  Use it like this:

            REM ... SPECIAL COLOR 255 0 0 This is a bright red reminder
            REM ... SPECIAL COLOR 0 128 0 This is a dark green reminder

       You  can  spell  COLOR either the American way ("COLOR") or the British way ("COLOUR").  This manual will
       use the American way.

       Immediately following COLOR should be three decimal numbers ranging from 0 to 255 specifying  red,  green
       and blue intensities, respectively.  The rest of the line is the text to put in the calendar.

       The  COLOR  special  is  "doubly  special",  because  in its normal operating mode, <b>remind</b> treats a COLOR
       special just like a MSG-type reminder.  Also, if you invoke  <b>Remind</b>  with  <b>-@</b>[<u>n</u>],  then  it  approximates
       SPECIAL COLOR reminders on your terminal.

       See also the documentation of the <b>$DefaultColor</b> system variable in the section "SYSTEM VARIABLES".

       The  <b>WEEK</b>  special lets you place annotations such as the week number in the calendar.  For example, this
       would number each Monday with the ISO 8601 week number.  The week number is shown like  this:  "(W<u>n</u>)"  in
       this example, but you can put whatever text you like after the WEEK keyword.

            REM Monday SPECIAL WEEK (W[weekno()])

       <b>NIFTY</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b>

       This section is a sampling of what you can do with <b>Remind</b>.

            REM 5 Feb 1991 AT 14:00 +45 *30 \
            RUN mail -s "Meeting at %2" $LOGNAME &lt;/dev/null &amp;

       On  5  February,  1991, this reminder will mail you reminders of a 2:00pm meeting at 1:15, 1:45 and 2:00.
       The subject of the mail message will be "Meeting at 2:00pm" and the body of the message will be blank.

            REM AT 17:00 RUN echo "5:00pm - GO HOME!" | xless -g +0+0 &amp;

       This reminder will pop up an xless window at 5:00pm every day.  The xless window will  contain  the  line
       "5:00pm - GO HOME!"

            REM AT 23:59 RUN (sleep 120; remind -a [filename()]) &amp;

       This  reminder  will  run  at one minute to midnight.  It will cause a new <b>Remind</b> process to start at one
       minute past midnight.  This allows you to have a continuous reminder service so you can work through  the
       night  and  still  get  timed  reminders  for  early  in  the morning.  Note that this trick is no longer
       necessary, providing you run <b>Remind</b> in daemon mode.

            remind -c12 /dev/null Jan 1993

       This invocation of <b>Remind</b> will cause it to print a calendar for 1993, with all entries left blank.

            REM CAL [trigdate()-date(year(trigdate()), 1, 1)+1]

       This example puts an entry in each box of a calendar showing the number (1-365 or 366) of the day of  the
       year.

            REM Tue 2 Nov SATISFY (year(trigdate())%4) == 0
            IF trigvalid()
                 REM [trigdate()] ++5 MSG \
                 U.S. Presidential Election!!
            ENDIF

       This  example  warns  you  5  days  ahead  of each American presidential election.  The first <b>REM</b> command
       calculates the first Tuesday after the first Monday in  November.   (This  is  equivalent  to  the  first
       Tuesday  on  or  after  2  November.)  The <b>SATISFY</b> clause ensures that the trigger date is issued only in
       election years, which are multiples of 4.  The second <b>REM</b> command actually issues the reminder.

       <b>DETAILS</b> <b>ABOUT</b> <b>TRIGGER</b> <b>COMPUTATION</b>

       Here is a <u>conceptual</u> description of how triggers are calculated.  Note that <b>Remind</b> actually uses  a  much
       more efficient procedure, but the results are the same as if the conceptual procedure had been followed.

       <b>Remind</b> starts from the current date (that is, the value of <b>today()</b>) and scans forward, examining each day
       one  at  a  time until it finds a date that satisfies the trigger, or can prove that no such dates (on or
       later than <b>today()</b>) exist.

       If <b>Remind</b> is executing a <b>SATISFY</b>-type reminder, it evaluates the expression with <b>trigdate()</b>  set  to  the
       date  found above.  If the expression evaluates to zero or the null string, <b>Remind</b> continues the scanning
       procedure described above, starting with the day after the trigger found above.

       The <b>SCANFROM</b> clause (having a syntax similar to <b>UNTIL</b>) can modify the  search  strategy  used.   In  this
       case,  <b>Remind</b>  begins  the  scanning  procedure at <u>scan_date</u>, which is the date specified in the <b>SCANFROM</b>
       clause.  For example:

            REM Mon 1 SCANFROM 17 Jan 1992 MSG Foo

       The example above will always have a trigger date of Monday, 3 February 1992.   That  is  because  <b>Remind</b>
       starts  scanning  from  17 January 1992, and stops scanning as soon as it hits a date that satisfies "Mon
       1."

       The main use of <b>SCANFROM</b> is in situations where you want to calculate the positions of floating holidays.
       Consider the Labour Day example shown much earlier.  Labour Day is the first Monday in September.  It can
       move over a range of 7 days.  Consider the following sequence:

            REM Mon 1 Sept SCANFROM [today()-7] ADDOMIT MSG Labour Day
            REM Mon AFTER MSG Hello

       The <b>SCANFROM</b> clause makes sure that <b>Remind</b> begins scanning from 7 days before  the  current  date.   This
       ensures  that  Labour  Day  for  the current year will continue to be triggered until 7 days after it has
       occurred.  This allows you to safely use the AFTER keyword as shown.

       As a special case, you can simply use  a  negative  number  after  SCANFROM;  a  negative  number  -N  is
       interpreted as N days before today.  Thus, the previous example could also be written like this:

            REM Mon 1 Sept SCANFROM -7 ADDOMIT MSG Labour Day
            REM Mon AFTER MSG Hello

       In  general, use <b>SCANFROM</b> as shown for safe movable <b>OMITs</b>.  The amount you should scan back by (7 days in
       the example above) depends on the number of possible consecutive <b>OMITted</b> days that may occur, and on  the
       range of the movable holiday.  Generally, a value of 7 is safe.

       The <b>FROM</b> clause operates almost like the counterpoint to <b>UNTIL</b>.  It prevents the reminder from triggering
       before the <b>FROM</b> date.  For example, the following reminder:

            REM Mon Thu FROM 23 Jul 2007 UNTIL 2 Aug 2007 MSG Test

       will trigger on Mondays and Thursdays between 23 July 2007 and 2 August 2007 inclusive.

       <b>FROM</b> is really just syntactic sugar; you could implement the reminder above as follows:

            REM Mon Thu SCANFROM [max(today(), '2007-07-23')] \
                   UNTIL 2 Aug 2007 MSG Test

       but  that's  a lot harder to read.  Internally, <b>Remind</b> treats <b>FROM</b> exactly as illustrated using <b>SCANFROM</b>.
       For that reason, you cannot use both <b>FROM</b> and <b>SCANFROM</b>.

       Note that if you use one <b>REM</b> command to calculate a trigger date, perform date calculations (addition  or
       subtraction, for example) and then use the modified date in a subsequent <b>REM</b> command, the results <u>may</u> <u>not</u>
       <u>be</u>  <u>what</u>  <u>you</u> <u>intended.</u>  This is because you have circumvented the normal scanning mechanism.  You should
       try to write <b>REM</b> commands that compute trigger dates that  can  be  used  unmodified  in  subsequent  <b>REM</b>
       commands.  The file "defs.rem" that comes with the <b>Remind</b> distribution contains examples.

       <b>DETAILS</b> <b>ABOUT</b> <b>TRIGVALID()</b>

       The  <b>trigvalid()</b>  function  returns  1 if <b>Remind</b> could find a trigger date for the previous <b>REM</b> or <b>IFTRIG</b>
       command.  More specifically, it returns 1 if <b>Remind</b> finds a date <u>not</u> <u>before</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>starting</u>  <u>date</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>the</u>
       <u>scanning</u> that satisfies the trigger.  In addition, there is one special case in which <b>trigvalid()</b> returns
       1 and <b>trigdate()</b> returns a meaningful result:

       If  the  <b>REM</b>  or  <b>IFTRIG</b> command did not contain an <b>UNTIL</b> clause, and contained all of the <u>day</u>, <u>month</u> and
       <u>year</u> components, then <b>Remind</b> will correctly compute a trigger date, even if it happens to be  before  the
       start of scanning.  Note that this behaviour is not true for versions of <b>Remind</b> prior to 03.00.01.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The traditional location of your reminders file or directory is:

               $HOME/.reminders

       where <b>$HOME</b> is your home directory.

       Remind  ships  with  some  preinstalled  files for holidays and language packs.  These are located in the
       following directory:

               /usr/share/remind/

       Do not hard-code the above directory in your reminder files.  Instead, use the value of  the  $SysInclude
       system variable.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       Dianne Skoll &lt;<a href="mailto:dianne@skoll.ca">dianne@skoll.ca</a>&gt; wrote <b>Remind</b>.  The moon code was copied largely unmodified from "moontool"
       by John Walker.  The sunrise and sunset functions use ideas from programs by Michael Schwartz and Marc T.
       Kaufman.   The  Hebrew  calendar support was taken from "hdate" by Amos Shapir.  OS/2 support was done by
       Darrel Hankerson, Russ Herman, and Norman Walsh.  The  supported  languages  and  their  translators  are
       listed  below.   Languages  marked  "complete"  support  error messages in that language; all others only
       support the substitution filter mechanism and month/day names.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If you find a bug in Remind, please report it to: <a href="mailto:dianne@skoll.ca">dianne@skoll.ca</a>

       There's no good reason why read-only system variables are not implemented as functions, or why  functions
       like <b>version()</b>, etc.  are not implemented as read-only system variables.

       Hebrew dates in <b>Remind</b> change at midnight instead of sunset.

       <b>Remind</b> has some built-in limits (for example, number of global <b>OMIT</b>s.)
