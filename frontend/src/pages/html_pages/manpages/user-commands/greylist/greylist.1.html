</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       greylist - command line interface to <b><a href="../man8/greylistd.8.html">greylistd</a>(8)</b>

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>greylist</b> { <b>-h</b> | <b>--help</b> | <b>help</b> }
       <b>greylist</b> <u>operation</u> <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program provides a command line interface to <b><a href="../man8/greylistd.8.html">greylistd</a></b>(8); please refer to that manual page for more
       information on the purpose and functionality of this program.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       In the following discussion, <u>data...</u> typically refers to the following <u>triplet</u> of information:

         <u>&lt;sending</u> <u>host's</u> <u>IP</u> <u>address&gt;</u> <u>&lt;sender@address&gt;</u> <u>&lt;recipient@address&gt;</u>

       The following operations are available:

       <b>add</b> [<b>--white</b>|<b>--grey</b>|<b>--black</b>] <u>data...</u>
              Add  <u>data</u>  to  the  corresponding  list  (<b>white</b>  if unspecified).  If the <u>triplet</u> of a future mail
              deliveriy (subject to timeouts) matches this data, the idea is that the message would be accepted,
              temporarily rejected, or permanently rejected, respectively.

       <b>delete</b> <u>data...</u>
              Remove <u>data</u> from all lists.  If the data exists in any list, the command returns an exit status of
              0, otherwise -1.  A message is printed on standard output indicating the action taken.

       <b>check</b> [<b>--white</b>|<b>--grey</b>|<b>--black</b>] <u>data...</u>
              Check the current status of <u>data</u>, i.e. if a message delivery would succeed if its <u>triplet</u>  matched
              this  data.  If a list is specified, the word "true" or "false" is printed, indicating whether the
              data was in the corresponding list; the exit status is also set accordingly.   Otherwise,  one  of
              the words "white", "grey", and "black" is written on standard output, and the exit status is 0, 1,
              or 2, respectively.

              NOTE: This operation is non-intrusive, and thus does not update any of the greylist data.  So, for
              instance,  if  the <u>data</u> is currently in the "grey" list, but its minimum retry time (<b>retryMin</b>) has
              elapsed, the text "white" would be printed.  However, unless an <b>update</b> takes place  prior  to  the
              <b>retryMax</b> timeout, the <u>data</u> would still expire from the "grey" list.

       <b>update</b> [<b>--white</b>|<b>--grey</b>|<b>--black</b>] <u>data...</u>
              Same,  but also update the greylist data accordingly.  So if <u>data</u> is currently greylisted, but the
              minimum retry time <b>retryMin</b> has elapsed since it was first seen, <u>data</u>  is  moved  to  the  "white"
              list.

              This operation would normally be used by mail transport agents (MTAs).

       <b>stats</b>  Print some statistics on greylist utilization and hits.

       <b>mrtg</b>   Print  statistics  on  greylist  and  whitelist  hits in a format that MRTG can use as an External
              Monitoring Script.

       <b>list</b> [<b>--white</b>] [<b>--grey</b>] [<b>--black</b>]
              Print available (original/unhashed) data items from the corresponding list(s).

              NOTE: Internally, <b><a href="../man8/greylistd.8.html">greylistd</a></b>(8) hashes the provided data into a single 32-bit value for efficiency.
              Prior to version 0.6, the original data was not retained; as of version 0.6, data is saved if  the
              "savetriplets" setting in the [data] section of the configuration file is "true".  Only data items
              (i.e. triplets) that have been seen while this setting were enabled can be listed.

       <b>save</b>   Force greylist data to be immediately saved (synchronized) to the filesystem.

              Data  is  also  saved  after  any operation if a certain <u>update</u> <u>interval</u> (default is 300 seconds/5
              minutes) has elapsed since the last save, and there are no pending requests to <b><a href="../man8/greylistd.8.html">greylistd</a></b>(8).

       <b>reload</b> Save greylist data to files, then reload configuration and data.

       <b>clear</b> [<b>--white</b>] [<b>--grey</b>] [<b>--black</b>]
              Clear all items in the specified list(s), or all lists if none is specified.

              If the whitelist is cleared, <u>all</u> new data trilplets will initially be in a "grey" state.

              Use with caution!

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       greylist add --white 1.2.3.4 mailinglist@somewhere subscriber@yourhost
              Whitelists messages received from the IP address 1.2.3.4 on behalf of  &lt;mailinglist@somewhere&gt;  to
              &lt;subscriber@yourhost&gt;.

       greylist check --grey 1.2.3.4 mailinglist@somewhere subscriber@yourhost
              Prints  "true"  or  "false"  on  standard  output,  depending on whether mail received from the IP
              address 1.2.3.4 on behalf of &lt;mailinglist@somewhere&gt; to &lt;subscriber@yourhost&gt; should  be  deferred
              or not, respectively.  The data is neither recorded nor changed to a "white" state.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>/var/run/greylistd/socket</b>
       The UNIX domain socket providing the main interface to "greylistd".
