               [--[no-]src] &lt;url&gt; [&lt;enlistment&gt;]
       scalar list
       scalar register [&lt;enlistment&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Scalar is a repository management tool that optimizes Git for use in large repositories. Scalar improves
       performance by configuring advanced Git settings, maintaining repositories in the background, and helping
       to reduce data sent across the network.

       An important Scalar concept is the enlistment: this is the top-level directory of the project. It usually
       contains the subdirectory <b>src/</b> which is a Git worktree. This encourages the separation between tracked
       files (inside <b>src/</b>) and untracked files, such as build artifacts (outside <b>src/</b>). When registering an
       existing Git worktree with Scalar whose name is not <b>src</b>, the enlistment will be identical to the
       worktree.

       The <b>scalar</b> command implements various subcommands, and different options depending on the subcommand.
       With the exception of <b>clone</b>, <b>list</b> and <b>reconfigure</b> <b>--all</b>, all subcommands expect to be run in an
       enlistment.

       The following options can be specified <u>before</u> the subcommand:

       -C &lt;directory&gt;
           Before running the subcommand, change the working directory. This option imitates the same option of
           <b><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></b>(1).

       -c &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
           For the duration of running the specified subcommand, configure this setting. This option imitates
           the same option of <b><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Clone</b>
       clone [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;url&gt; [&lt;enlistment&gt;]
           Clones the specified repository, similar to <b><a href="../man1/git-clone.1.html">git-clone</a></b>(1). By default, only commit and tree objects
           are cloned. Once finished, the worktree is located at <u>&lt;enlistment&gt;</u><b>/src</b>.

           The sparse-checkout feature is enabled (except when run with <b>--full-clone</b>) and the only files present
           are those in the top-level directory. Use <b>git</b> <b>sparse-checkout</b> <b>set</b> to expand the set of directories
           you want to see, or <b>git</b> <b>sparse-checkout</b> <b>disable</b> to expand to all files (see <b><a href="../man1/git-sparse-checkout.1.html">git-sparse-checkout</a></b>(1)
           for more details). You can explore the subdirectories outside your sparse-checkout by using <b>git</b>
           <b>ls-tree</b> <b>HEAD</b>[<b>:</b><u>&lt;directory&gt;</u>].

       -b &lt;name&gt;, --branch &lt;name&gt;
           Instead of checking out the branch pointed to by the cloned repository’s HEAD, check out the <u>&lt;name&gt;</u>
           branch instead.

       --[no-]single-branch
           Clone only the history leading to the tip of a single branch, either specified by the <b>--branch</b> option
           or the primary branch remote’s <b>HEAD</b> points at.

           Further fetches into the resulting repository will only update the remote-tracking branch for the
           branch this option was used for the initial cloning. If the HEAD at the remote did not point at any
           branch when <b>--single-branch</b> clone was made, no remote-tracking branch is created.

       --[no-]src
           By default, <b>scalar</b> <b>clone</b> places the cloned repository within a <u>&lt;entlistment&gt;</u><b>/src</b> directory. Use
           <b>--no-src</b> to place the cloned repository directly in the <u>&lt;enlistment&gt;</u> directory.

       --[no-]tags
           By default, <b>scalar</b> <b>clone</b> will fetch the tag objects advertised by the remote and future <b>git</b> <b>fetch</b>
           commands will do the same. Use <b>--no-tags</b> to avoid fetching tags in <b>scalar</b> <b>clone</b> and to configure the
           repository to avoid fetching tags in the future. To fetch tags after cloning with <b>--no-tags</b>, run <b>git</b>
           <b>fetch</b> <b>--tags</b>.

       --[no-]full-clone
           A sparse-checkout is initialized by default. This behavior can be turned off via <b>--full-clone</b>.

   <b>List</b>
       list
           List enlistments that are currently registered by Scalar. This subcommand does not need to be run
           inside an enlistment.

   <b>Register</b>
       register [&lt;enlistment&gt;]
           Adds the enlistment’s repository to the list of registered repositories and starts background
           maintenance. If <u>&lt;enlistment&gt;</u> is not provided, then the enlistment associated with the current working
           directory is registered.

           Note: when this subcommand is called in a worktree that is called <b>src/</b>, its parent directory is
           considered to be the Scalar enlistment. If the worktree is <u>not</u> called <b>src/</b>, it itself will be
           considered to be the Scalar enlistment.

   <b>Unregister</b>
       unregister [&lt;enlistment&gt;]
           Remove the specified repository from the list of repositories registered with Scalar and stop the
           scheduled background maintenance.

   <b>Run</b>
       scalar run ( all | config | commit-graph | fetch | loose-objects | pack-files ) [&lt;enlistment&gt;]
           Run the given maintenance task (or all tasks, if <b>all</b> was specified). Except for <b>all</b> and <b>config</b>, this
           subcommand simply hands off to <b><a href="../man1/git-maintenance.1.html">git-maintenance</a></b>(1) (mapping <b>fetch</b> to <b>prefetch</b> and <b>pack-files</b> to
           <b>incremental-repack</b>).

           These tasks are run automatically as part of the scheduled maintenance, as soon as the repository is
           registered with Scalar. It should therefore not be necessary to run this subcommand manually.

           The <b>config</b> task is specific to Scalar and configures all those opinionated default settings that make
           Git work more efficiently with large repositories. As this task is run as part of <b>scalar</b> <b>clone</b>
           automatically, explicit invocations of this task are rarely needed.

   <b>Reconfigure</b>
       After a Scalar upgrade, or when the configuration of a Scalar enlistment was somehow corrupted or changed
       by mistake, this subcommand allows to reconfigure the enlistment.

       With the <b>--all</b> option, all enlistments currently registered with Scalar will be reconfigured. Use this
       option after each Scalar upgrade.

   <b>Diagnose</b>
       diagnose [&lt;enlistment&gt;]
           When reporting issues with Scalar, it is often helpful to provide the information gathered by this
           command, including logs and certain statistics describing the data shape of the current enlistment.

           The output of this command is a <b>.zip</b> file that is written into a directory adjacent to the worktree
           in the <b>src</b> directory.

   <b>Delete</b>
       delete &lt;enlistment&gt;
           This subcommand lets you delete an existing Scalar enlistment from your local file system,
           unregistering the repository.
