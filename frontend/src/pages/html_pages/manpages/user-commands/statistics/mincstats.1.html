</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mincstats - calculate simple statistics across voxels of a minc file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mincstats</b> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;in1&gt;.mnc

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Mincstats</u>  will  calculate  simple statistical measures across all voxels of a minc file. Note that these
       are global statistical measures and not voxel-by-voxel measures (see <u>mincaverage</u> for  that).  By  default
       all  statistics  are calculated. If any statistics are requested via a command-line option, then only the
       requested statistics are printed.

       A very useful feature of this program is the ability to restrict  the  set  of  voxels  included  in  the
       statistic calculation, either by restricting the range of included values, or by using a mask file with a
       restricted  range.  Multiple  ranges  for the input file or mask file can be specified. For each range of
       included volume values, and for each range of mask values, the relevant statistics are printed  out  (n*m
       values,  where  n is the number of volume ranges and m the number of mask ranges). These calculations are
       done in a single pass through the data, so specifying multiple ranges is much  faster  than  running  the
       program repeatedly. This is quite helpful when calculating many regional averages with a VOI mask volume.

       Special  mention should be given to histograms and related statistical measures. The default range of the
       histogram is from the smallest value in the file to the largest. In the not uncommon, but  special,  case
       when  the  number  of  histogram bins exactly matches the number of possible values in the file (e.g. 256
       bins for full-range byte data), the histogram can end up with some odd features when  using  the  default
       histogram  range.  This arises from the discretization of the data that are then rebinned into a slightly
       mismatched histgram. For the example of byte data, the values that should be used  are  256  bins  and  a
       histogram  range  that  extends half a bin below the smallest value and half a bin above the largest. Use
       option <b>-discrete_histogram</b> to work this out automatically, or use <b>-integer_histogram</b> to have bins of unit
       width if the input data are inherently integer (e.g. label data). In general, one should be careful about
       the rebinning of discretized data to a histogram  with  a  bin  size  that  is  close  to  the  level  of
       discretization.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Note  that  options  can  be  specified in abbreviated form (as long as they are unique) and can be given
       anywhere on the command line. The order in which the statistics are  printed  will  be  always  the  same
       irrespective or the order in which they are requested on the command line

</pre><h4><b>General</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-clobber</b>
              Overwrite an existing file.

       <b>-noclobber</b>
              Don't overwrite an existing file (default).

       <b>-verbose</b>
              Print out extra information (more than the default).

       <b>-quiet</b> Print out only the requested numbers

       <b>-max_buffer_size_in_kb</b> <u>size</u>
              Specify the maximum size of the internal buffers (in kbytes). Default is 4 MB.

</pre><h4><b>Invalid</b> <b>value</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-ignore_nan</b>
              Exclude invalid values (outside valid range) from statistic calculations. This is the default.

       <b>-include_nan</b>
              Treat invalid values as zeros and include them in statistic calculations.

       <b>-replace_nan</b> <u>value</u>
              Replace  invalid  values  with  the  specified  value  and  include  the  new  value  in statistic
              calculations.

</pre><h4><b>Volume</b> <b>range</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-floor</b> <u>min1</u>,<u>min2</u>,...
              Comma-separated list of lower bounds for ranges of data to include in statistic calculation.

       <b>-ceil</b> <u>max1</u>,<u>max2</u>,...
              Comma-separated list of upper bounds for ranges of data to include in statistic calculation.

       <b>-range</b> <u>min1</u>,<u>max1</u>,<u>min2</u>,<u>max2</u>,...
              Comma-separated list of lower and upper  bounds  for  ranges  of  data  to  include  in  statistic
              calculation.

       <b>-binvalue</b> <u>val1</u>,<u>val2</u>,...
              Comma-separated  list of integer values to include in statistic calculation. A range of +/- 0.5 is
              defined around each specified value.

       <b>-mask</b> <u>filename.mnc</u>
              Name of file to be used for masking data included in statistic calculation. For this to  have  any
              effect, you must specify a mask range with one of the following options.

       <b>-mask_floor</b> <u>min1</u>,<u>min2</u>,...:
              Like <b>-floor</b>, but applied to the mask file.

       <b>-mask_ceil</b> <u>max1</u>,<u>max2</u>,...
              Like <b>-ceil</b>, but applied to the mask file.

       <b>-mask_range</b> <u>min1</u>,<u>max1</u>,<u>min2</u>,<u>max2</u>,...
              Like <b>-range</b>, but applied to the mask file.

       <b>-mask_binvalue</b> <u>val1</u>,<u>val2</u>,...
              Like <b>-binvalue</b>, but applied to the mask file.

</pre><h4><b>Histogram</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-histogram</b> <u>filename</u>
              Specify  the name of a file into which the histogram is written. If multiple ranges or mask ranges
              are specified, then all histograms are written in this file, separated by blank lines. Information
              describing each histogram is written before it in lines starting with the hash (pound)  character.
              These files can be loaded into gnuplot.

       <b>-hist_bins</b> <u>number-of-bins</u>
              Specify the number of bins in the histogram.

       <b>-bins</b> <u>number-of-bins</u>
              Synonym for <b>-hist_bins</b>.

       <b>-hist_floor</b> <u>min</u>
              Specify lower bound for histogram.

       <b>-hist_ceil</b> <u>max</u>
              Specify upper bound for histogram.

       <b>-hist_range</b> <u>min</u> <u>max</u>
              Specify a range for the histogram

       <b>-integer_histogram</b>
              Create  bins of unit width, centred around integer values. This is useful for integer data such as
              labels. The histogram range is rounded to the nearest integer, then the min is lowered and the max
              is raised by 0.5. The number of bins is taken as the difference of these two  values.   Note  that
              0.01  is  added  to  the minimum and subtracted from the maximum prior to the rounding in order to
              ensure that a correctly specified range (e.g. [0.5,255.5]) is  preserved.  If  you  want  to  have
              integer  bins that are wider than one, you will have to work out the histogram range and number of
              bins yourself and not use this option.

       <b>-discrete_histogram</b>
              Attempt to match the histogram to the discretization of the input data. This  is  appropriate  for
              continuous  data  that  are  stored in an integer representation and when a bin width close to the
              discretization is desired. This is similar to <b>-integer_histogram</b>, except that  the  the  histogram
              range  is  first  converted to voxel values which are rounded and extended by half a bin on either
              side. This new voxel range is then converted back to real values. The number of bins is  taken  as
              the  difference in the voxel value range. Note that this does not account for variations in slice-
              to-slice scaling, so odd histogram effects may still  occur.  This  option  is  intended  to  give
              behaviour similar to that of <u>volume_stats</u>.

       <b>-int_max_bins</b> <u>number-of-bins</u>
              Specify  the  largest  histogram that can be automatically sized with the above options. The limit
              prevents accidental creation of huge histograms.  This option replaced the old <b>-max_bins</b> option in
              MINC 1.1.

</pre><h4><b>Basic</b> <b>statistics</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-all</b>   Compute all statistical measures. This is the default.

       <b>-none</b>  Synonym for <b>-count</b> (for similarity to volume_stats). Note that although  this  was  necessary  for
              <u>volume_stats</u>, it is not needed here, since specifying any of these options automatically turns off
              <b>-all</b>

       <b>-count</b> Count the number of voxels that are within the range and mask.

       <b>-percent</b>
              Print the percentage of voxels within the range and mask

       <b>-volume</b>
              Print the volume of the voxels within the range and mask (in mm-cubed).

       <b>-min</b>   Print the minimum value.

       <b>-max</b>   Print the maximum value.

       <b>-sum</b>   Print the sum of all values.

       <b>-sum2</b>  Print the sum of the squares of all values.

       <b>-mean</b>  Print the mean.

       <b>-variance</b>
              Print the variance.

       <b>-stddev</b>
              Print the standard deviation.

       <b>-skewness</b>
              Print the sample skewness (3rd moment) .

       <b>-kurtosis</b>
              Print the sample kurtosis (4th moment) .

       <b>-CoM</b>   Print  the  centre  of  mass. Both the voxel coordinate and the world coordinates are printed. The
              voxel coordinates are printed in file order, whilst the world coordinates  are  printed  in  x,y,z
              order.

       <b>-com</b>   Synonym for <b>-CoM</b>.

       <b>-world_only</b>
              Print the centre of mass in world coordinates only.

</pre><h4><b>Histogram</b> <b>statistics</b></h4><pre>
       Note  that  histogram statistics are derived solely from the histogram counts and bin centres, so results
       such as the median will not be exactly the same as the true value for all included voxels.  For  example,
       the  error on the median can be as large as a half bin width. Furthermore, if the histogram range is less
       than that of included voxels, then the result applies only to voxels included in the histogram.

       <b>-hist_count</b>
              Print number of voxels in histogram. This may be different from the number of included and  masked
              voxels if the histogram range is less than the range of the included data.

       <b>-hist_percent</b>
              Print percentage of voxels included in histogram.

       <b>-median</b>
              Print the histogram median.

       <b>-majority</b>
              Print the bin centre (intensity value) for the bin with the most counts.

       <b>-biModalT</b>
              Print the bi-modal threshold separating the volume into two classes The default is to use the otsu
              method (see options below)

       <b>-otsu</b>  Use  the  method  described  in Otsu N, "A Threshold Selection Method from Grey-level Histograms",
              IEEE Trans on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.  1979, 9:1; 62-66 to calculate the threshold

       <b>-kittler</b>
              Use the Kittler&amp;Illingworth '86 algorithm to calculate the for bimodal threshold.  Kittler,  J.  &amp;
              Illingworth J., "Minimum error thresholding", Pattern Recognition, vol 19, pp 41-47, 1986.

       <b>-kapur</b> Use the Kapur et al. '85 algorithm to calculate the bimodal threshold.  Kapur, Sahoo &amp; Wong "A new
              method  for  Gray-level picture thresholding using the entropy of the histogram", Computer Vision,
              Graphics, and Image Processing, vol 29, pp 273-285, 1985.

       <b>-simple</b>
              Use simple mean-of-means algorithm to calculate the bimodal threshold This is more computationally
              expensive than some of the alternatives, and doesn't seem to do a great job. But it does seem more
              robust than some of the other methods.

       <b>-pctT</b>  Print the threshold needed for a particular critical percentage of the histogram.

       <b>-entropy</b>
              Print the Shannon entropy.

                   H(x) = - Sum(P(i) * log2(P(i))

              where P(i) is the bin probability

</pre><h4><b>Generic</b> <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>commands:</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-help</b>  Print summary of command-line options and exit.
