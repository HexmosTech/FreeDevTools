</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       traffic_top - Display Traffic Server statistics

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>traffic_top</b>  program  provides  a  simple CLI view of your Traffic Server statistics, reminiscent of
       programs like <b><a href="../man1/top.1.html">top</a>(1)</b> and <b><a href="../man1/nmon.1.html">nmon</a>(1)</b> for system processes and statistics.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-s</b> <b>COUNT</b>
              Number of seconds in between each polling of the Traffic Server statistics API. The default  is  5
              seconds.

       <b>URL|hostname|hostname:port</b>
              Location at which the JSON output of Traffic Server statistics are accessible.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>traffic_top</b>  program  requires that your Traffic Server nodes are running the <u>Stats</u> <u>Over</u> <u>HTTP</u> <u>plugin</u>
       and that the machine from which you run <b>traffic_top</b> is able to access  the  HTTP(S)  end  point  for  the
       plugin.

       If, for example, you have the following entry in your <u>plugin.config</u> to enable the plugin:

          stats_over_http.so statistics

       And  your  Traffic  Server  node is accessible using the hostname <b>ats.example.tld</b> (listening on port 80),
       then you would run <b>traffic_top</b> as follows:

          traffic_top <a href="http://ats.example.tld/statistics">http://ats.example.tld/statistics</a>

       The hostname, port, and path to the <u>Stats</u> <u>Over</u> <u>HTTP</u> <u>plugin</u> JSON output should be adjusted as necessary to
       match your environment.

       <b>IMPORTANT:</b>
          The statistics provided by Traffic Server (through <b>traffic_ctl</b> and  <u>Stats</u>  <u>Over</u>  <u>HTTP</u>  <u>Plugin</u>)  expose
          quite  a  bit  about  the  inner  workings  of  your Traffic Server cache. While consumers of the JSON
          statistics endpoint won't be able to see or modify the raw contents of your cache, it  is  still  very
          strongly advised to limit access to this URL.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  startup  (and  successful connection to the <u>Stats</u> <u>Over</u> <u>HTTP</u> <u>Plugin</u> endpoint), you will be presented
       with a curses interface that looks like:
         [image: Main interface for the traffic_top command line  program.]   [image]  Main  interface  for  the
         traffic_top command line program..UNINDENT

         Each area of the main interface is explained in the following sections.

   <b>Cache</b> <b>Information</b>
   <b>Disk</b> <b>Used</b>
       The amount of disk space currently in use by the Traffic Server cache. This number will never exceed <u>Disk</u>
       <u>Total</u>.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.cache.bytes_used</u>.

   <b>Disk</b> <b>Total</b>
       Total disk space allocated for Traffic Server cache.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.cache.bytes_total</u>.

   <b>Ram</b> <b>Used</b>
       Current  amount  of RAM Cache occupied by objects. Objects located and served from the Traffic Server RAM
       Cache avoid the much slower disk I/O necessary to serve from spinning rust.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.cache.ram_cache.bytes_used</u>

   <b>Ram</b> <b>Total</b>
       Total space allocated for used by the Traffic Server RAM Cache.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.cache.ram_cache.total_bytes</u>

   <b>Lookups</b>
       Total cache object lookups performed, including disk and RAM caches.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.cache_lookups</u>

   <b>Writes</b>
       Total number of object writes to the Traffic Server cache.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.cache_writes</u>.

   <b>Updates</b>
       Total number of existing cache objects which have been updated with new content from  the  origin  server
       (i.e.  existing  cache  object was stale, so Traffic Server revalidated against the origin and received a
       new object).

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.cache_updates</u>.

   <b>Deletes</b>
       Total number of Traffic Server cache objects which have been deleted (generally through a PURGE request).

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.cache_deletes</u>.

   <b>Read</b> <b>Active</b>
       Current number of active cache reads.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.cache.read.active</u>.

   <b>Writes</b> <b>Act</b>
       Current number of active cache writes.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.cache.write.active</u>.

   <b>Update</b> <b>Act</b>
       Current number of active cache updates.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.cache.update.active</u>.

   <b>Entries</b>
       The current number of cache directory entries in use.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.cache.direntries.used</u>.

   <b>Avg</b> <b>Size</b>
       The average size of current in the cache directory. This is calculated  by  dividing  <u>Entries</u>  into  <u>Disk</u>
       <u>Used</u>.

       Statistics: <u>proxy.process.cache.bytes_used</u>, <u>proxy.process.cache.direntries.used</u>.

   <b>DNS</b> <b>Lookup</b>
       Total number of DNS lookups performed by Traffic Server, regardless of whether they were full DNS queries
       or were satisfied by entries in the HostDB cache. If you are not operating a forward proxy and if none of
       your origin servers are mapped by hostnames, then it is normal for your HostDB cache to be empty.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.hostdb.total_lookups</u>.

   <b>DNS</b> <b>Hits</b>
       Total number of DNS lookups which were successfully served from the HostDB cache.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.hostdb.total_hits</u>.

   <b>DNS</b> <b>Serve</b> <b>Stale</b>
       Total  number  of DNS lookups which were successfully served from the HostDB cache while the HostDB cache
       entry was stale. See <u>proxy.config.hostdb.serve_stale_for</u> for how this feature is configured.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.hostdb.total_serve_stale</u>.

   <b>Ram</b> <b>Hit</b>
       The percentage of cache lookups which were served successfully from the RAM Cache (thus  avoiding  slower
       I/O  from the disk cache, or even slower network I/O to the origin server). This is calculated as a ratio
       from the two RAM Cache statistics for hits and misses.

       Statistics: <u>proxy.process.cache.ram_cache.hits</u>, <u>proxy.process.cache.ram_cache.misses</u>.

   <b>Fresh</b>
       The percentage of cache lookups which located a fresh cache object (i.e. an object not  in  need  of  any
       revalidation).  These  transactions  are served directly from the cache to the client without any need to
       contact origin servers or spend time updating the cache. An effective Traffic Server cache  will  have  a
       very high Fresh percentage, as these are the fastest responses to clients.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.transaction_counts.hit_fresh</u>.

   <b>Revalidate</b>
       The  percentage  of cache lookups which located a stale cache object, but for which the origin server did
       not return new data when Traffic Server revalidated the object. Revalidated  objects  don't  incur  cache
       update  performance hits, but they do still lead to (what ends up being unnecessary) network traffic with
       origin servers.

       A high percentage of revalidated cache lookups may indicate that Traffic Server is being  too  aggressive
       with its object staleness heuristics.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.transaction_counts.hit_revalidated</u>.

   <b>Cold</b>
       The  percentage of cache lookups which located an expired cache object. These were requests which located
       a matching object in the cache, but it had already been expired fully and a new copy was  retrieved  from
       the  origin server.  Unfortunately, the new copy from the origin server ended up being the unchanged from
       what had been marked expired in the cache.

       A high percentage of cold misses indicates that your origin servers  are  setting  expirations  on  their
       responses which are too short, as compared to the actual lifetime of the content in those responses.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.transaction_counts.miss_cold</u>.

   <b>Changed</b>
       The  percentage  of  cache  lookups  which located an expired cache object and which resulted in new data
       being retrieved from the origin server.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.transaction_counts.miss_changed</u>.

   <b>Not</b> <b>Cache</b>
       The percentage of requests for which the requested object was marked not cacheable by the origin  server.
       A  high  percentage  of uncacheable objects may indicate that either your origin servers simply contain a
       large amount of dynamic, uncacheable data, or that they are not properly setting cache control headers in
       their responses.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.transaction_counts.miss_not_cacheable</u>.

   <b>No</b> <b>Cache</b>
       The percentage of requests for which the client indicated that the cache  should  not  be  used  (e.g.  a
       <b>Cache-Control:</b> <b>no-cache</b> request header was present).

       A  high  percentage  of  these requests may indicate possible client-side abuse of your proxy, in which a
       disproportionate number of client connections are attempting to force their way past your Traffic  Server
       cache.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.transaction_counts.miss_client_no_cache</u>.

   <b>Fresh</b> <b>(ms)</b>
       The average amount of time per lookup (in milliseconds) spent serving requests which were served by fresh
       cache  lookups.  Note  that the underlying statistic is the total amount of time Traffic Server has spent
       serving these requests since startup, whereas <b>traffic_top</b> is displaying the number averaged by the  total
       <u>Fresh</u> requests.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.transaction_totaltime.hit_fresh</u>.

   <b>Reval</b> <b>(ms)</b>
       The  average  amount  of  time  per  lookup  (in  milliseconds)  spent  serving  requests  which involved
       revalidating a stale object for which the origin server did not return new data. Note that the underlying
       statistic is the total amount of time Traffic Server has spent  serving  these  requests  since  startup,
       whereas <b>traffic_top</b> is displaying the number averaged by the total <u>Revalidate</u> requests.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.transaction_totaltime.hit_revalidated</u>.

   <b>Cold</b> <b>(ms)</b>
       The  average  amount  of  time per lookup (in milliseconds) spent serving requests which involved expired
       cache objects. Note that the underlying statistic is the total amount of time Traffic  Server  has  spent
       serving  these requests since startup, whereas <b>traffic_top</b> is displaying the number averaged by the total
       <u>Cold</u> requests.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.transaction_totaltime.miss_cold</u>.

   <b>Chang</b> <b>(ms)</b>
       The average amount of time per lookup (in milliseconds) spent  serving  requests  which  were  served  by
       Traffic  Server  with  new data obtained from an origin server. Note that the underlying statistic is the
       total amount of time Traffic Server has spent serving these requests since startup,  whereas  <b>traffic_top</b>
       is displaying the number averaged by the total <u>Changed</u> requests.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.transaction_totaltime.miss_changed</u>.

   <b>Not</b> <b>(ms)</b>
       The average amount of time per lookup (in milliseconds) spent serving requests which were served from the
       origin  server because it had marked the object as uncacheable. Note that the underlying statistic is the
       total amount of time Traffic Server has spent serving these requests since startup,  whereas  <b>traffic_top</b>
       is displaying the number averaged by the total <u>Not</u> <u>Cache</u> requests.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.transaction_totaltime.miss_not_cacheable</u>.

   <b>No</b> <b>(ms)</b>
       The  average  amount of time per lookup (in milliseconds) spent serving requests which were served by the
       origin server because the client had requested that the Traffic Server cache be bypassed. Note  that  the
       underlying  statistic  is  the total amount of time Traffic Server has spent serving these requests since
       startup, whereas <b>traffic_top</b> is displaying the number averaged by the total <u>No</u> <u>Cache</u> requests.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.transaction_totaltime.miss_client_no_cache</u>.

   <b>DNS</b> <b>Hit</b>
       The percentage of DNS lookups which were served from the HostDB cache, rather  than  requiring  full  DNS
       queries.

       Statistics: <u>proxy.process.hostdb.total_hits</u>, <u>proxy.process.hostdb.total_lookups</u>.

   <b>DNS</b> <b>Entry</b>
       The  total  number of entries in the HostDB lookup cache. If you are not operating a forward proxy and if
       none of your origin servers are mapped by hostnames, then it is normal for your HostDB cache to be empty.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.hostdb.cache.current_items</u>.

   <b>Client</b> <b>Request</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Response</b>
   <b>GET,</b> <b>HEAD,</b> <b>POST</b>
       Each of these display the percentage of total requests by clients to Traffic Server which used the  given
       HTTP method.

       Statistics:               <u>proxy.process.http.get_requests</u>,              <u>proxy.process.http.head_requests</u>,
       <u>proxy.process.http.post_requests</u>.

   <b>2xx</b>
       Percentage of all requests made to Traffic Server which resulted in an HTTP response code between 200 and
       299 (inclusive) being sent back to the client. 2xx response codes all indicate some  form  of  successful
       transaction with content delivered.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.2xx_responses</u>.

   <b>3xx</b>
       Percentage of all requests made to Traffic Server which resulted in an HTTP response code between 300 and
       399  (inclusive)  being  sent  back to the client. 3xx response codes indicate non-error conditions; most
       commonly redirects or IMS not-modified responses that did not deliver content (because they did not  need
       to).

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.3xx_responses</u>.

   <b>4xx</b>
       Percentage of all requests made to Traffic Server which resulted in an HTTP response code between 400 and
       499  (inclusive) being sent back to the client. 4xx response codes are used for requests which included a
       client-side error. Most frequently these responses are for invalid URLs (e.g. 404 Not  Found),  but  also
       include  authentication  failures  (e.g.  403 Forbidden). In short, Traffic Server refused to fulfill the
       request because the client sent invalid or incorrect information.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.4xx_responses</u>.

   <b>5xx</b>
       Percentage of all requests made to Traffic Server which resulted in an HTTP response code between 500 and
       599 (inclusive) being sent back to the client. 5xx response code indicate  a  server-side  error.  For  a
       caching  proxy  like  Traffic Server, these are likely to be most often returned for gateway errors; e.g.
       502 Bad Gateway (the origin server address was invalid or a connection could not be  established  at  all
       due  to system or network failures) and 504 Gateway Timeout (the origin server was contacted, but did not
       return data in the time allowed).

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.5xx_responses</u>.

   <b>Conn</b> <b>Fail</b>
       The total number of connections to Traffic Server which failed to connect properly.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.transaction_counts.errors.connect_failed</u>.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Err</b>
       The total number of Traffic Server transactions which experienced an error not covered by <u>Conn</u>  <u>Fail</u>  and
       <u>Abort</u>.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.transaction_counts.errors.other</u>.

   <b>Abort</b>
       The  total  number  of  Traffic  Server  transactions which were prematurely ended (connection was closed
       before all data had been received and/or sent).

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.transaction_counts.errors.aborts</u>.

   <b>200,</b> <b>206,</b> <b>301,</b> <b>302,</b> <b>304,</b> <b>404,</b> <b>502</b>
       The percentage of total Traffic Server transactions which resulted in the specified HTTP  response  code.
       For details on the meaning of individual status codes, please refer to <u>HTTP</u> <u>Status</u> <u>Codes</u>.

       Statistics:              <u>proxy.process.http.200_responses</u>,              <u>proxy.process.http.206_responses</u>,
       <u>proxy.process.http.301_responses</u>,   <u>proxy.process.http.302_responses</u>,   <u>proxy.process.http.304_responses</u>,
       <u>proxy.process.http.404_responses</u>, <u>proxy.process.http.502_responses</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Traffic  Server  also  provides  statistics for every other response code. The keen observer will have
          hopefully already recognized the pattern in statistic names.

   <b>100</b> <b>B,</b> <b>1</b> <b>KB,</b> <b>3</b> <b>KB,</b> <b>5</b> <b>KB,</b> <b>10</b> <b>KB,</b> <b>1</b> <b>MB,</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>1</b> <b>MB</b>
       Each of these fields indicates the percentage of responses  from  Traffic  Server  which  fell  within  a
       particular  size  (document  body  size, excluding response headers). The individual fields are the upper
       bounds of exclusive <u>buckets</u>, meaning that a response with a document body of 4,500 bytes will be  counted
       in the <b>5</b> <b>KB</b> field, but not in any of the smaller sizes.

       Statistics:  <u>proxy.process.http.response_document_size_100</u>, <u>proxy.process.http.response_document_size_1K</u>,
       <u>proxy.process.http.response_document_size_3K</u>,               <u>proxy.process.http.response_document_size_5K</u>,
       <u>proxy.process.http.response_document_size_10K</u>,              <u>proxy.process.http.response_document_size_1M</u>,
       <u>proxy.process.http.response_document_size_inf</u>.

   <b>Client</b>
   <b>Requests</b>
       Total number of client requests serviced by Traffic Server. This includes both successful content-bearing
       responses as well as errors,  redirects,  and  not-modified  IMS  responses.  Additionally,  this  number
       includes  requests  which  were  serviced from the Traffic Server cache as well as through proxied origin
       connections.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.incoming_requests</u>.

   <b>Req/Conn</b>
       The average number of requests made per client connection. When Keep-Alive support is enabled in  Traffic
       Server  and  clients  make  use  of  it, they are able to submit multiple document requests over a single
       connection in some situations. This number is calculated from the total number of client requests divided
       by the total number of new connections that have been created.

       Statistics: <u>proxy.process.http.incoming_requests</u>, <u>proxy.process.http.total_client_connections</u>.

   <b>New</b> <b>Conn</b>
       The total number of new HTTP connections from clients which have been created over the  lifetime  of  the
       Traffic Server process.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.total_client_connections</u>.

   <b>Curr</b> <b>Conn</b>
       The number of currently-open HTTP connections from clients with Traffic Server.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.current_client_connections</u>.

   <b>Active</b> <b>Con</b>
       The number of currently active client connection threads (requests in the process of being fulfilled when
       the statistics snapshot was taken).

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.current_active_client_connections</u>.

   <b>Head</b> <b>Bytes</b>
       The total bytes consumed by outgoing server response headers from Traffic Server to clients.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.user_agent_response_header_total_size</u>.

   <b>Body</b> <b>Bytes</b>
       The total bytes consumed by outgoing document bodies in responses from Traffic Server to clients.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.user_agent_response_document_total_size</u>.

   <b>Avg</b> <b>Size</b>
       Average size in bytes of combined headers and document bodies for Traffic Server responses to clients.

       Statistics:                                     <u>proxy.process.http.user_agent_response_header_total_size</u>,

   <b>Net</b> <b>(bits)</b>
       The  summed  bits (not bytes) of all Traffic Server responses to clients, whether served from the Traffic
       Server or through a proxied connection to an origin server.

       Statistics:                                     <u>proxy.process.http.user_agent_response_header_total_size</u>,
       <u>proxy.process.http.user_agent_response_document_total_size</u>.

   <b>Resp</b> <b>(ms)</b>
       The  average  response  time by Traffic Server across all client requests. Response time is measured from
       the moment a client connection is established, until  the  moment  the  last  byte  of  the  response  is
       delivered.  This  field is simply the result of dividing the total time spent by Traffic Server servicing
       client requests by the total number of those requests.

       Statistics: <u>proxy.process.http.total_transactions_time</u>, <u>proxy.process.http.incoming_requests</u>.

   <b>Origin</b> <b>Server</b>
   <b>Requests</b>
       The total number of requests made by Traffic Server to origin servers, because client requests could  not
       be  fulfilled  by  the Traffic Server cache (for any reason, whether it was not present in the cache, was
       stale or expired, or not cacheable).

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.outgoing_requests</u>.

   <b>Req/Conn</b>
       The average number of requests made to origin servers by Traffic Server per connection.   This  field  is
       simply  the  result of dividing the total number of requests made by the total number of connections that
       have ever been opened.

       Statistics: <u>proxy.process.http.outgoing_requests</u>, <u>proxy.process.http.total_server_connections</u>.

   <b>New</b> <b>Conn</b>
       The total number of new HTTP connections from Traffic Server to origin servers  that  have  been  created
       during the lifetime of the Traffic Server process.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.total_server_connections</u>.

   <b>Curr</b> <b>Conn</b>
       The  number  of  HTTP connections currently open from Traffic Server to origin servers. Note that Traffic
       Server maintains a configurable number of origin server connections open at all times, whether there  are
       requests being proxied or not, when configured as a reverse proxy to a known list of origin servers. This
       is  not the case for forward proxy configurations, however, as Traffic Server has no foreknowledge of the
       servers to which clients may try to connect.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.current_server_connections</u>.

   <b>Head</b> <b>Bytes</b>
       The total bytes delivered as headers in responses from origin servers to Traffic Server.

       Statistic: <u>proxy.process.http.origin_server_response_header_total_size</u>.

   <b>Body</b> <b>Bytes</b>
       The total bytes delivered as document bodies in responses from origin servers to Traffic Server.
