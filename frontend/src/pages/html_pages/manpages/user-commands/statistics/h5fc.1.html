</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Fortran - Reports statistics regarding an HDF5 file and the objects in the file.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       usage: h5fc [OPTIONS] &lt;compile line&gt;

              OPTIONS:

       <b>-help</b>  This help message.

       <b>-echo</b>  Show all the shell commands executed

       <b>-prefix</b>=<u>DIR</u>
              Prefix directory to find HDF5 lib/ and include/

              subdirectories [default: <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>]

       <b>-show</b>  Show the commands without executing them

       <b>-showconfig</b>
              Show the HDF5 library configuration summary

       <b>-shlib</b> Compile with shared HDF5 libraries

       <b>-noshlib</b>
              Compile with static HDF5 libraries [default]

       &lt;compile line&gt;
              - the normal compile line options for your compiler.

              h5fc  uses  the  same  compiler you used to compile HDF5. Check with your compiler's man pages for
              more information on which options are needed.

              You can override the compiler and  linker  to  compile  your  program  by  setting  the  following
              environment variables accordingly:

       HDF5_FC
              -  use a different Fortran 90 or 95 compiler

       HDF5_FLINKER
              -  use a different linker

       HDF5_USE_SHLIB=[yes|no]
              -  use shared or static version of the HDF5 library

              [default: no]

              You  can  also  add  or change paths and flags to the compile line using the following environment
              varibles or by assigning them to their counterparts in the 'Things You Can Modify to  Override...'
              section of h5fc

       Variable
              Current value to be replaced

       HDF5_FFLAGS
              ""

       HDF5_LDFLAGS
              ""

       HDF5_LIBS
              ""

              Note that adding library paths to HDF5_LDFLAGS where another hdf5 version is located may link your
              program with that other hdf5 library version.
