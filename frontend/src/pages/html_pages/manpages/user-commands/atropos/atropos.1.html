</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       atropos - NGS read trimming tool that is specific, sensitive, and speedy

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>atropos</b> [--config &lt;config file&gt;] &lt;command&gt; [options]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>commands</b>
       detect:
              Detect  adapter sequences directly from read sequences. Use this command if you are unsure if your
              data has adapters, or if you know that it has adapters but you don't know  what  are  the  adapter
              sequences.

       error: Estimate  the  sequencing error rate. Use this command to help determine the quality of your data,
              and to decide the value for the max error rate  (<b>-e</b>)  parameter.  Normal  error  for  an  Illumina
              experiment is around 1% or less. We recommend setting <b>-e</b> to 10x the empirical error rate.

       qc:    Compute read-level statistics. The output is identical to running the 'trim' command with '--stats
              pre'. Use this command to get an idea of the quality of your raw data.

       trim:  Trim  adapters  and  low-quality bases, and perform other NGS preprocessing. This command provides
              most of Atropos' functionality.

   <b>optional</b> <b>arguments</b>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              show this help message and exit

       <b>--config</b> &lt;config file&gt;
              provide options in a config file

       Use   "atropos   &lt;command&gt;   <b>--help</b>"   to   see   all   options   for   a    specific    command.     See
       <a href="http://atropos.readthedocs.org/">http://atropos.readthedocs.org/</a> for full documentation.
