       beef - Flexible Brainfuck interpreter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>beef</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... <u>FILE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Beef is a flexible interpreter for the Brainfuck programming language.

       It can be configured using the options described below, making it possible to run Brainfuck programs that
       make assumptions about the behavior of the interpreter.

       Beef  sets  no  arbitrary  limit to the size of the memory tape used by the program, and allocates memory
       cells as they are needed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-p</b>, <b>--program</b>=<u>PROGRAM</u>
          Execute <u>PROGRAM</u>. This can only be used if a <u>FILE</u> containing a Brainfuck program has not been  provided
          on the command line after all options.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--store</b>=<u>WHAT</u>
          Choose  the value to store in the tape when the end of input is reached.  <u>WHAT</u> defaults to <b>zero</b> (store
          a zero); other possible values are <b>eof</b> (store -1, the value usually assigned to the C constant EOF) or
          <b>same</b> (leave the value untouched).

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--enable-debugging</b>
          Enable debugging support. By default, debugging instructions are not executed.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
          Write program's output to <u>FILE</u>.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--input-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
          Read program's input from <u>FILE</u>.

       <u>FILE</u> can be local path or any URI supported by GIO. If <u>FILE</u> is '<b>-</b>', standard input  or  standard  output,
       depending on the context, will be used.

</pre><h4><b>BRAINFUCK</b> <b>LANGUAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Brainfuck  programs work on a memory tape which contains a virtually unlimited number of cells; each cell
       can store a value, which can be seen either as a character or as an integer number (its  ASCII  encoding)
       depending  on  the context. There is a cursor pointing to one of the cells, which is considered to be the
       current one; the cursor can be moved around at will.

       A Brainfuck source file is made of a number of  Brainfuck  instructions;  any  symbol  which  is  not  an
       instruction is considered a comment and is ignored.  There are exceptions to this rule, see below.

       The Brainfuck instructions are:

       <b>+</b>
          Increase the value in the current cell by one.

       <b>-</b>
          Decrease the value in the current cell by one.

       <b>&gt;</b>
          Move the cursor one cell to the right.

       <b>&lt;</b>
          Move the cursor one cell to the left.

       <b>[</b>
          Start  a loop. The instructions contained in the loop are executed as long as the value of the current
          cell is not zero.

       <b>]</b>
          End a loop started by a '<b>[</b>' instruction.

       <b>,</b>
          Read a character from the input and store it in che current cell.

       <b>.</b>
          Write the value of the current cell to the output.

       <b>#</b>
          Dump the content of the memory tape for debugging purposes. This instruction  is  ignored  unless  the
          <b>enable-debugging</b> option is present.

       If  the  first line of the source file starts with the magic sequence '<b>#!</b>' it is ignored. This allows you
       to execute a Brainfuck program without calling Beef explicitly, like  you  would  do  for  eg.  a  Python
       program.

       The  symbol  '<b>!</b>' has a special meaning to Beef: it marks the end of a program's code and the beginning of
       its input. If this symbol is present in the source file, runtime input will be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The classic Hello World program could be written in Brainfuck as

          ++++++++++[&gt;+++++++&gt;++++++++++&gt;+++&gt;+&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-]&gt;++.&gt;+.++++++
          +..+++.&gt;++.&lt;&lt;+++++++++++++++.&gt;.+++.------.--------.&gt;+.&gt;.

       The following Brainfuck program can be used to replace the <u><a href="../man1/cat.1.html">cat</a>(1)</u> utility:

          #!/usr/bin/beef
          ,[.,]

       That's of course assuming you don't need any of <u><a href="../man1/cat.1.html">cat</a>(1)</u>'s fancy commandline options, you have a shell with
       working I/O redirection and a sense of humor.

1.2.0                                                                                                    <u><a href="../man1/BEEF.1.html">BEEF</a></u>(1)
