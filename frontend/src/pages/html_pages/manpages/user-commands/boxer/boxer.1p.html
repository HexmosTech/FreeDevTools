</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       boxer is a single front-end to various "boxing" tasks - i.e. structured system-wide tasks commonly
       applied in batch to larger deployments.

       Unlike tools like Puppet, CFEngine and Chef which operates on top of an installed system, boxer
       preferrably interacts with the packaging system of the system.  Boxer is inspired by Fully Automated
       Installer (FAI) and the classes are modelled after that tool, but goal of boxer is to become obsolete:
       boxer can include custom tweaks but encourages avoiding them and instead pass upstream to distro
       designers the needed customizations.

       The core distribution includes commands to analyze, initialize and refresh a Debian(-based) operating
       system.

       However, boxer is pluggable and it is anticipated that plugins on CPAN will cover other related tasks.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes the commands included with the core Boxer::CLI distribution. Others are available
       as plugins. Run "boxer commands" to see a list of locally installed commands.

   <b>Meta</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <u>"boxer</u> <u>about"</u>

       Shows the version numbers of all installed boxer commands, plus the CPAN ID of each command's author.

       <u>"boxer</u> <u>aliases"</u>

       Many commands have aliases or shortcuts. For example, the following two are equivalent:

          $ boxer install --arch armhf --classes swedish
          $ boxer deploy --arch armhf --classes swedish

       "boxer aliases" shows a list of available aliases.

       <u>"boxer</u> <u>commands"</u>

       Shows a list of installed boxer commands, along with a brief extract.

       <u>"boxer</u> <u>help"</u>

       Running the "boxer help" command on its own shows a list of commands with their abstracts. Detailed help
       for a particular command can be shown by providing that as an argument. For example, for help on the
       "boxer detect" command, run:

          $ boxer help detect
