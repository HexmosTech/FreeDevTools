</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cupp</b> - generate dictionaries for attacks from personal data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        <b>cupp</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       CUPP(Common  User  Passwords  Profiler)  is tool to generate wordlist from common user profiler. The most
       common form of authentication is the combination of a username and a  password  or  passphrase.  If  both
       match  values  stored within a locally stored table, the user is authenticated for a connection. Password
       strength is a  measure  of  the  difficulty  involved  in  guessing  or  breaking  the  password  through
       cryptographic techniques or library-based automated testing of alternate values.

       A weak password can also be one that is easily guessed by someone profiling the user, such as a birthday,
       nickname,  address, name of a pet or relative,or a common word such as God, love, money or password. From
       a social engineering you can obtain information to use with the CUPP, this way the tool can create a very
       effective dictionary for brute force attacks or dictionary attacks.

       That is why CUPP has born, and it can be used in situations like  legal  penetration  tests  or  forensic
       crime investigations.
