</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       GNU <b>nm</b> lists the symbols from object files <u>objfile</u>....  If no object files are listed as arguments, <b>nm</b>
       assumes the file <u>a.out</u>.

       For each symbol, <b>nm</b> shows:

       •   The symbol value, in the radix selected by options (see below), or hexadecimal by default.

       •   The symbol type.  At least the following types are used; others are, as well, depending on the object
           file  format.   If  lowercase,  the  symbol  is  usually  local;  if  uppercase, the symbol is global
           (external).  There are however a few lowercase symbols that are  shown  for  special  global  symbols
           ("u", "v" and "w").

           "A" The symbol's value is absolute, and will not be changed by further linking.

           "B"
           "b" The symbol is in the uninitialized data section (known as BSS).

           "C" The  symbol  is  common.   Common  symbols are uninitialized data.  When linking, multiple common
               symbols may appear with the same name.  If the symbol is defined anywhere, the common symbols are
               treated as undefined references.

           "D"
           "d" The symbol is in the initialized data section.

           "G"
           "g" The symbol is in an initialized data section for small objects.  Some object file formats  permit
               more  efficient access to small data objects, such as a global int variable as opposed to a large
               global array.

           "i" For PE format files this indicates that the symbol is in a section specific to the implementation
               of DLLs.  For ELF format files this indicates that the symbol is an indirect function.  This is a
               GNU extension to the standard set of ELF symbol types.  It indicates a symbol which if referenced
               by a relocation does not evaluate to its address, but instead must be invoked  at  runtime.   The
               runtime execution will then return the value to be used in the relocation.

           "N" The symbol is a debugging symbol.

           "p" The symbols is in a stack unwind section.

           "R"
           "r" The symbol is in a read only data section.

           "S"
           "s" The symbol is in an uninitialized data section for small objects.

           "T"
           "t" The symbol is in the text (code) section.

           "U" The symbol is undefined.

           "u" The  symbol is a unique global symbol.  This is a GNU extension to the standard set of ELF symbol
               bindings.  For such a symbol the dynamic linker will make sure that in the entire  process  there
               is just one symbol with this name and type in use.

           "V"
           "v" The  symbol is a weak object.  When a weak defined symbol is linked with a normal defined symbol,
               the normal defined symbol is used with no error.  When a weak undefined symbol is linked and  the
               symbol is not defined, the value of the weak symbol becomes zero with no error.  On some systems,
               uppercase indicates that a default value has been specified.

           "W"
           "w" The  symbol is a weak symbol that has not been specifically tagged as a weak object symbol.  When
               a weak defined symbol is linked with a normal defined symbol, the normal defined symbol  is  used
               with  no  error.  When a weak undefined symbol is linked and the symbol is not defined, the value
               of the symbol is determined  in  a  system-specific  manner  without  error.   On  some  systems,
               uppercase indicates that a default value has been specified.

           "-" The  symbol is a stabs symbol in an a.out object file.  In this case, the next values printed are
               the stabs other field, the stabs desc field, and the stab type.  Stabs symbols are used  to  hold
               debugging information.

           "?" The symbol type is unknown, or object file format specific.

       •   The symbol name.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are equivalent.

       <b>-A</b>
       <b>-o</b>
       <b>--print-file-name</b>
           Precede  each  symbol by the name of the input file (or archive member) in which it was found, rather
           than identifying the input file once only, before all of its symbols.

       <b>-a</b>
       <b>--debug-syms</b>
           Display all symbols, even debugger-only symbols; normally these are not listed.

       <b>-B</b>  The same as <b>--format=bsd</b> (for compatibility with the MIPS <b>nm</b>).

       <b>-C</b>
       <b>--demangle[=</b><u>style</u><b>]</b>
           Decode (<u>demangle</u>) low-level symbol  names  into  user-level  names.   Besides  removing  any  initial
           underscore  prepended by the system, this makes C++ function names readable. Different compilers have
           different mangling styles.  The  optional  demangling  style  argument  can  be  used  to  choose  an
           appropriate demangling style for your compiler.

       <b>--no-demangle</b>
           Do not demangle low-level symbol names.  This is the default.

       <b>-D</b>
       <b>--dynamic</b>
           Display  the  dynamic  symbols  rather  than the normal symbols.  This is only meaningful for dynamic
           objects, such as certain types of shared libraries.

       <b>-f</b> <u>format</u>
       <b>--format=</b><u>format</u>
           Use the output format <u>format</u>, which can be "bsd", "sysv", or "posix".  The default  is  "bsd".   Only
           the first character of <u>format</u> is significant; it can be either upper or lower case.

       <b>-g</b>
       <b>--extern-only</b>
           Display only external symbols.

       <b>--plugin</b> <u>name</u>
           Load  the plugin called <u>name</u> to add support for extra target types.  This option is only available if
           the toolchain has been built with plugin support enabled.

       <b>-l</b>
       <b>--line-numbers</b>
           For each symbol, use debugging information to try to find a filename and line number.  For a  defined
           symbol, look for the line number of the address of the symbol.  For an undefined symbol, look for the
           line  number  of  a  relocation  entry which refers to the symbol.  If line number information can be
           found, print it after the other symbol information.

       <b>-n</b>
       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--numeric-sort</b>
           Sort symbols numerically by their addresses, rather than alphabetically by their names.

       <b>-p</b>
       <b>--no-sort</b>
           Do not bother to sort the symbols in any order; print them in the order encountered.

       <b>-P</b>
       <b>--portability</b>
           Use the POSIX.2 standard output format instead of the default format.  Equivalent to <b>-f</b> <b>posix</b>.

       <b>-S</b>
       <b>--print-size</b>
           Print both value and size of defined symbols for the "bsd" output style.  This option has  no  effect
           for  object  formats that do not record symbol sizes, unless <b>--size-sort</b> is also used in which case a
           calculated size is displayed.

       <b>-s</b>
       <b>--print-armap</b>
           When listing symbols from archive members, include the index: a mapping (stored in the archive by  <b>ar</b>
           or <b>ranlib</b>) of which modules contain definitions for which names.

       <b>-r</b>
       <b>--reverse-sort</b>
           Reverse the order of the sort (whether numeric or alphabetic); let the last come first.

       <b>--size-sort</b>
           Sort symbols by size.  The size is computed as the difference between the value of the symbol and the
           value  of  the symbol with the next higher value.  If the "bsd" output format is used the size of the
           symbol is printed, rather than the value, and <b>-S</b> must be used in order both  size  and  value  to  be
           printed.

       <b>--special-syms</b>
           Display  symbols which have a target-specific special meaning.  These symbols are usually used by the
           target for some special processing and are not normally helpful when included included in the  normal
           symbol  lists.   For  example for ARM targets this option would skip the mapping symbols used to mark
           transitions between ARM code, THUMB code and data.

       <b>-t</b> <u>radix</u>
       <b>--radix=</b><u>radix</u>
           Use <u>radix</u> as the radix for printing the symbol values.  It must be <b>d</b> for decimal, <b>o</b> for octal,  or  <b>x</b>
           for hexadecimal.

       <b>--target=</b><u>bfdname</u>
           Specify an object code format other than your system's default format.

       <b>-u</b>
       <b>--undefined-only</b>
           Display only undefined symbols (those external to each object file).

       <b>--defined-only</b>
           Display only defined symbols for each object file.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version number of <b>nm</b> and exit.

       <b>-X</b>  This  option  is  ignored for compatibility with the AIX version of <b>nm</b>.  It takes one parameter which
           must be the string <b>32_64</b>.  The default mode of AIX <b>nm</b> corresponds to <b>-X</b> <b>32</b>, which is not supported by
           GNU <b>nm</b>.

       <b>--help</b>
           Show a summary of the options to <b>nm</b> and exit.

       <b>@</b><u>file</u>
           Read command-line options from <u>file</u>.  The options read are inserted in place of  the  original  @<u>file</u>
           option.   If  <u>file</u>  does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and
           not removed.

           Options in <u>file</u> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option  by
           surrounding  the  entire  option  in  either  single  or  double  quotes.  Any character (including a
           backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The <u>file</u>  may
           itself contain additional @<u>file</u> options; any such options will be processed recursively.
