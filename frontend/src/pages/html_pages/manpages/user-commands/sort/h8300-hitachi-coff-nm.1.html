</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       GNU  <b>nm</b>  lists  the symbols from object files <u>objfile</u>....  If no object files are listed as arguments, <b>nm</b>
       assumes the file <u>a.out</u>.

       For each symbol, <b>nm</b> shows:

       •   The symbol value, in the radix selected by options (see below), or hexadecimal by default.

       •   The symbol type.  At least the following types are used; others are, as well, depending on the object
           file format.  If lowercase, the symbol is local; if uppercase, the symbol is global (external).

           "A" The symbol's value is absolute, and will not be changed by further linking.

           "B" The symbol is in the uninitialized data section (known as BSS).

           "C" The symbol is common.  Common symbols are uninitialized  data.   When  linking,  multiple  common
               symbols may appear with the same name.  If the symbol is defined anywhere, the common symbols are
               treated as undefined references.

           "D" The symbol is in the initialized data section.

           "G" The  symbol is in an initialized data section for small objects.  Some object file formats permit
               more efficient access to small data objects, such as a global int variable as opposed to a  large
               global array.

           "I" The  symbol  is  an  indirect  reference to another symbol.  This is a GNU extension to the a.out
               object file format which is rarely used.

           "N" The symbol is a debugging symbol.

           "R" The symbol is in a read only data section.

           "S" The symbol is in an uninitialized data section for small objects.

           "T" The symbol is in the text (code) section.

           "U" The symbol is undefined.

           "V" The symbol is a weak object.  When a weak defined symbol is linked with a normal defined  symbol,
               the  normal defined symbol is used with no error.  When a weak undefined symbol is linked and the
               symbol is not defined, the value of the weak symbol becomes zero with no error.

           "W" The symbol is a weak symbol that has not been specifically tagged as a weak object symbol.   When
               a  weak  defined symbol is linked with a normal defined symbol, the normal defined symbol is used
               with no error.  When a weak undefined symbol is linked and the symbol is not defined,  the  value
               of  the  symbol  is  determined  in  a  system-specific  manner  without error.  On some systems,
               uppercase indicates that a default value has been specified.

           "-" The symbol is a stabs symbol in an a.out object file.  In this case, the next values printed  are
               the  stabs  other field, the stabs desc field, and the stab type.  Stabs symbols are used to hold
               debugging information.

           "?" The symbol type is unknown, or object file format specific.

       •   The symbol name.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are equivalent.

       <b>-A</b>
       <b>-o</b>
       <b>--print-file-name</b>
           Precede each symbol by the name of the input file (or archive member) in which it was  found,  rather
           than identifying the input file once only, before all of its symbols.

       <b>-a</b>
       <b>--debug-syms</b>
           Display all symbols, even debugger-only symbols; normally these are not listed.

       <b>-B</b>  The same as <b>--format=bsd</b> (for compatibility with the MIPS <b>nm</b>).

       <b>-C</b>
       <b>--demangle[=</b><u>style</u><b>]</b>
           Decode  (<u>demangle</u>)  low-level  symbol  names  into  user-level  names.   Besides removing any initial
           underscore prepended by the system, this makes C++ function names readable. Different compilers  have
           different  mangling  styles.  The  optional  demangling  style  argument  can  be  used  to choose an
           appropriate demangling style for your compiler.

       <b>--no-demangle</b>
           Do not demangle low-level symbol names.  This is the default.

       <b>-D</b>
       <b>--dynamic</b>
           Display the dynamic symbols rather than the normal symbols.  This  is  only  meaningful  for  dynamic
           objects, such as certain types of shared libraries.

       <b>-f</b> <u>format</u>
       <b>--format=</b><u>format</u>
           Use  the  output  format <u>format</u>, which can be "bsd", "sysv", or "posix".  The default is "bsd".  Only
           the first character of <u>format</u> is significant; it can be either upper or lower case.

       <b>-g</b>
       <b>--extern-only</b>
           Display only external symbols.

       <b>-l</b>
       <b>--line-numbers</b>
           For each symbol, use debugging information to try to find a filename and line number.  For a  defined
           symbol, look for the line number of the address of the symbol.  For an undefined symbol, look for the
           line  number  of  a  relocation  entry which refers to the symbol.  If line number information can be
           found, print it after the other symbol information.

       <b>-n</b>
       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--numeric-sort</b>
           Sort symbols numerically by their addresses, rather than alphabetically by their names.

       <b>-p</b>
       <b>--no-sort</b>
           Do not bother to sort the symbols in any order; print them in the order encountered.

       <b>-P</b>
       <b>--portability</b>
           Use the POSIX.2 standard output format instead of the default format.  Equivalent to <b>-f</b> <b>posix</b>.

       <b>-S</b>
       <b>--print-size</b>
           Print size, not the value, of defined symbols for the "bsd" output format.

       <b>-s</b>
       <b>--print-armap</b>
           When listing symbols from archive members, include the index: a mapping (stored in the archive by  <b>ar</b>
           or <b>ranlib</b>) of which modules contain definitions for which names.

       <b>-r</b>
       <b>--reverse-sort</b>
           Reverse the order of the sort (whether numeric or alphabetic); let the last come first.

       <b>--size-sort</b>
           Sort symbols by size.  The size is computed as the difference between the value of the symbol and the
           value  of  the symbol with the next higher value.  If the "bsd" output format is used the size of the
           symbol is printed, rather than the value, and <b>-S</b> must be used in order both  size  and  value  to  be
           printed.

       <b>--special-syms</b>
           Display  symbols which have a target-specific special meaning.  These symbols are usually used by the
           target for some special processing and are not normally helpful when included included in the  normal
           symbol  lists.   For  example for ARM targets this option would skip the mapping symbols used to mark
           transistions between ARM code, THUMB code and data.

       <b>-t</b> <u>radix</u>
       <b>--radix=</b><u>radix</u>
           Use <u>radix</u> as the radix for printing the symbol values.  It must be <b>d</b> for decimal, <b>o</b> for octal,  or  <b>x</b>
           for hexadecimal.

       <b>--target=</b><u>bfdname</u>
           Specify an object code format other than your system's default format.

       <b>-u</b>
       <b>--undefined-only</b>
           Display only undefined symbols (those external to each object file).

       <b>--defined-only</b>
           Display only defined symbols for each object file.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version number of <b>nm</b> and exit.

       <b>-X</b>  This  option  is  ignored for compatibility with the AIX version of <b>nm</b>.  It takes one parameter which
           must be the string <b>32_64</b>.  The default mode of AIX <b>nm</b> corresponds to <b>-X</b> <b>32</b>, which is not supported by
           GNU <b>nm</b>.

       <b>--help</b>
           Show a summary of the options to <b>nm</b> and exit.
