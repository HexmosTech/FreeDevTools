</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sort — sort, merge, or sequence check text files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       sort <b>[</b>-m<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-o <u>output</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-bdfinru<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-t <u>char</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-k <u>keydef</u><b>]</b>... <b>[</b><u>file</u>...<b>]</b>

       sort <b>[</b>-c|-C<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-bdfinru<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-t <u>char</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-k <u>keydef</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>sort</u> utility shall perform one of the following functions:

        1. Sort lines of all the named files together and write the result to the specified output.

        2. Merge lines of all the named (presorted) files together and write the result to the specified output.

        3. Check that a single input file is correctly presorted.

       Comparisons  shall  be  based  on one or more sort keys extracted from each line of input (or, if no sort
       keys are specified, the entire line up to, but not including, the terminating &lt;newline&gt;),  and  shall  be
       performed  using the collating sequence of the current locale. If this collating sequence does not have a
       total ordering of all characters (see  the  Base  Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>7.3.2</u>,
       <u>LC_COLLATE</u>),  any  lines  of input that collate equally should be further compared byte-by-byte using the
       collating sequence for the POSIX locale.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>sort</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>, except for Guideline 9, and the <b>-k</b> <u>keydef</u> option should follow the <b>-b</b>, <b>-d</b>, <b>-f</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>-n</b>,
       and <b>-r</b> options. In addition, <b>'+'</b> may be recognized as an option delimiter as well as <b>'-'</b>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-c</b>        Check  that  the  single  input file is ordered as specified by the arguments and the collating
                 sequence of the current locale. Output shall not be sent to  standard  output.  The  exit  code
                 shall indicate whether or not disorder was detected or an error occurred. If disorder (or, with
                 <b>-u</b>,  a duplicate key) is detected, a warning message shall be sent to standard error indicating
                 where the disorder or duplicate key was found.

       <b>-C</b>        Same as <b>-c</b>, except that a warning message shall not be sent to standard error if  disorder  or,
                 with <b>-u</b>, a duplicate key is detected.

       <b>-m</b>        Merge only; the input file shall be assumed to be already sorted.

       <b>-o</b> <u>output</u> Specify  the name of an output file to be used instead of the standard output. This file can be
                 the same as one of the input <u>file</u>s.

       <b>-u</b>        Unique: suppress all but one in each set of lines having equal  keys.   If  used  with  the  <b>-c</b>
                 option,  check  that  there  are no lines with duplicate keys, in addition to checking that the
                 input file is sorted.

       The following options shall override the default ordering rules. When ordering options appear independent
       of any key field specifications, the requested field ordering rules shall be applied globally to all sort
       keys. When attached to a specific key (see <b>-k</b>), the specified ordering options shall override all  global
       ordering options for that key.

       <b>-d</b>        Specify  that  only  &lt;blank&gt;  characters  and alphanumeric characters, according to the current
                 setting of <u>LC_CTYPE</u>, shall be significant in comparisons. The behavior is undefined for a  sort
                 key to which <b>-i</b> or <b>-n</b> also applies.

       <b>-f</b>        Consider  all  lowercase  characters  that have uppercase equivalents, according to the current
                 setting of <u>LC_CTYPE</u>, to be the uppercase equivalent for the purposes of comparison.

       <b>-i</b>        Ignore all characters that are non-printable, according to the  current  setting  of  <u>LC_CTYPE</u>.
                 The behavior is undefined for a sort key for which <b>-n</b> also applies.

       <b>-n</b>        Restrict  the sort key to an initial numeric string, consisting of optional &lt;blank&gt; characters,
                 optional &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; character, and zero or more digits with an optional radix character and
                 thousands separators (as defined in the current locale), which shall be  sorted  by  arithmetic
                 value.  An  empty digit string shall be treated as zero. Leading zeros and signs on zeros shall
                 not affect ordering.

       <b>-r</b>        Reverse the sense of comparisons.

       The treatment of field separators can be altered using the options:

       <b>-b</b>        Ignore leading &lt;blank&gt; characters when determining the  starting  and  ending  positions  of  a
                 restricted  sort  key.  If  the  <b>-b</b> option is specified before the first <b>-k</b> option, it shall be
                 applied to all <b>-k</b> options. Otherwise, the <b>-b</b> option can be attached independently  to  each  <b>-k</b>
                 <u>field_start</u> or <u>field_end</u> option-argument (see below).

       <b>-t</b> <u>char</u>   Use  <u>char</u>  as the field separator character; <u>char</u> shall not be considered to be part of a field
                 (although it can be included in a sort key). Each occurrence of <u>char</u> shall be significant  (for
                 example,  &lt;<u>char</u>&gt;&lt;<u>char</u>&gt;  delimits  an  empty  field). If <b>-t</b> is not specified, &lt;blank&gt; characters
                 shall be used  as  default  field  separators;  each  maximal  non-empty  sequence  of  &lt;blank&gt;
                 characters that follows a non-&lt;blank&gt; shall be a field separator.

       Sort keys can be specified using the options:

       <b>-k</b> <u>keydef</u> The  <u>keydef</u>  argument  is a restricted sort key field definition. The format of this definition
                 is:

                     <u>field_start</u><b>[</b><u>type</u><b>][</b>,<u>field_end</u><b>[</b><u>type</u><b>]]</b>

                 where <u>field_start</u> and <u>field_end</u> define a key field restricted to a portion of the line (see the
                 EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section), and <u>type</u> is one or more modifiers from the  list  of  characters
                 <b>'b'</b>,  <b>'d'</b>,  <b>'f'</b>,  <b>'i'</b>,  <b>'n'</b>,  <b>'r'</b>.  The <b>'b'</b> modifier shall behave like the <b>-b</b> option, but shall
                 apply only to the <u>field_start</u> or <u>field_end</u> to which it is attached. The other  modifiers  shall
                 behave  like the corresponding options, but shall apply only to the key field to which they are
                 attached; they shall have this effect if specified with <u>field_start</u>, <u>field_end</u>, or both. If any
                 modifier is attached to a <u>field_start</u> or to a <u>field_end</u>,  no  option  shall  apply  to  either.
                 Implementations  shall  support  at  least  nine  occurrences  of the <b>-k</b> option, which shall be
                 significant in command line order. If no <b>-k</b> option is specified, a  default  sort  key  of  the
                 entire line shall be used.

                 When  there  are  multiple key fields, later keys shall be compared only after all earlier keys
                 compare equal. Except when the <b>-u</b> option is specified, lines that otherwise compare equal shall
                 be ordered as if none of the options <b>-d</b>, <b>-f</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>-n</b>, or <b>-k</b> were present (but with <b>-r</b>  still  in
                 effect, if it was specified) and with all bytes in the lines significant to the comparison. The
                 order in which lines that still compare equal are written is unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>file</u>      A pathname of a file to be sorted, merged, or checked. If no <u>file</u> operands are specified, or if
                 a  <u>file</u>  operand  is  <b>'-'</b>,  the  standard input shall be used. If <u>sort</u> encounters an error when
                 opening or reading a <u>file</u> operand, it may exit without writing any output to standard output or
                 processing later operands.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The standard input shall be used only if no <u>file</u> operands are specified, or if a  <u>file</u>  operand  is  <b>'-'</b>.
       See the INPUT FILES section.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  input  files shall be text files, except that the <u>sort</u> utility shall add a &lt;newline&gt; to the end of a
       file ending with an incomplete last line.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>sort</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_COLLATE</u>
                 Determine the locale for ordering rules.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files) and
                 the behavior of character classification for the <b>-b</b>, <b>-d</b>, <b>-f</b>, <b>-i</b>, and <b>-n</b> options.

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>LC_NUMERIC</u>
                 Determine  the locale for the definition of the radix character and thousands separator for the
                 <b>-n</b> option.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Unless the <b>-o</b> or <b>-c</b> options are in effect, the standard output shall contain the sorted input.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages. When <b>-c</b> is specified, if disorder  is  detected
       (or  if <b>-u</b> is also specified and a duplicate key is detected), a message shall be written to the standard
       error which identifies the input line at which disorder (or a duplicate  key)  was  detected.  A  warning
       message  about  correcting an incomplete last line of an input file may be generated, but need not affect
       the final exit status.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       If the <b>-o</b> option is in effect, the sorted input shall be written to the file <u>output</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The notation:

           -k <u>field_start</u><b>[</b><u>type</u><b>][</b>,<u>field_end</u><b>[</b><u>type</u><b>]]</b>

       shall define a key field that begins at <u>field_start</u> and ends at <u>field_end</u> inclusive,  unless  <u>field_start</u>
       falls  beyond  the  end  of  the line or after <u>field_end</u>, in which case the key field is empty. A missing
       <u>field_end</u> shall mean the last character of the line.

       A field comprises a maximal sequence of non-separating characters and, in the absence of option  <b>-t</b>,  any
       preceding field separator.

       The <u>field_start</u> portion of the <u>keydef</u> option-argument shall have the form:

           <u>field_number</u><b>[</b>.<u>first_character</u><b>]</b>

       Fields  and  characters  within  fields  shall  be  numbered  starting  with  1.   The  <u>field_number</u>  and
       <u>first_character</u> pieces, interpreted as positive decimal integers, shall specify the first character to be
       used as part of a sort key. If <u>.first_character</u> is omitted, it shall refer to the first character of  the
       field.

       The <u>field_end</u> portion of the <u>keydef</u> option-argument shall have the form:

           <u>field_number</u><b>[</b>.<u>last_character</u><b>]</b>

       The <u>field_number</u> shall be as described above for <u>field_start.</u>  The <u>last_character</u> piece, interpreted as a
       non-negative  decimal  integer,  shall  specify the last character to be used as part of the sort key. If
       <u>last_character</u> evaluates to zero or <u>.last_character</u> is omitted, it shall refer to the last  character  of
       the field specified by <u>field_number</u>.

       If  the  <b>-b</b>  option  or <b>b</b> type modifier is in effect, characters within a field shall be counted from the
       first non-&lt;blank&gt; in the field. (This shall apply separately to <u>first_character</u> and <u>last_character</u>.)

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All input files were output successfully, or <b>-c</b> was specified and  the  input  file  was  correctly
             sorted.

        1    Under  the  <b>-c</b> option, the file was not ordered as specified, or if the <b>-c</b> and <b>-u</b> options were both
             specified, two input lines were found with equal keys.

       &gt;1    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The default requirements shall apply, except that if <u>sort</u> encounters an error when opening or  reading  a
       <u>file</u> operand, it may exit without writing any output to standard output or processing later operands.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  default  value  for  <b>-t</b>, &lt;blank&gt;, has different properties from, for example, <b>-t</b>"&lt;space&gt;". If a line
       contains:

           &lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;foo

       the following treatment would occur with default  separation  as  opposed  to  specifically  selecting  a
       &lt;space&gt;:
                                     ┌───────┬───────────────────┬──────────────┐
                                     │ <b>Field</b> │      <b>Default</b>      │ <b>-t</b> <b>"&lt;space&gt;"</b> │
                                     ├───────┼───────────────────┼──────────────┤
                                     │   1   │ &lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;foo │ <u>empty</u>        │
                                     │   2   │ <u>empty</u>             │ <u>empty</u>        │
                                     │   3   │ <u>empty</u>             │ foo          │
                                     └───────┴───────────────────┴──────────────┘

       The  leading field separator itself is included in a field when <b>-t</b> is not used. For example, this command
       returns an exit status of zero, meaning the input was already sorted:

           sort -c -k 2 &lt;&lt;eof
           y&lt;tab&gt;b
           x&lt;space&gt;a
           eof

       (assuming that a &lt;tab&gt; precedes the &lt;space&gt; in the current collating sequence). The  field  separator  is
       not  included  in a field when it is explicitly set via <b>-t</b>.  This is historical practice and allows usage
       such as:

           sort -t "|" -k 2n &lt;&lt;eof
           Atlanta|425022|Georgia
           Birmingham|284413|Alabama
           Columbia|100385|South Carolina
           eof

       where the second field can be correctly sorted  numerically  without  regard  to  the  non-numeric  field
       separator.

       The  wording  in  the  OPTIONS section clarifies that the <b>-b</b>, <b>-d</b>, <b>-f</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>-n</b>, and <b>-r</b> options have to come
       before the first sort key specified if they are intended to apply to all specified keys. The  way  it  is
       described  in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 matches historical practice, not historical documentation.  The
       results are unspecified if these options are specified after a <b>-k</b> option.

       The <b>-f</b> option might not work as expected in locales where there is not a one-to-one  mapping  between  an
       uppercase and a lowercase letter.

       When using <u>sort</u> to process pathnames, it is recommended that LC_ALL, or at least LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE,
       are  set  to  POSIX  or C in the environment, since pathnames can contain byte sequences that do not form
       valid characters in some locales, in which case the utility's behavior would be undefined. In  the  POSIX
       locale each byte is a valid single-byte character, and therefore this problem is avoided.

       If  the  collating  sequence of the current locale does not have a total ordering of all characters, this
       can affect the behavior of <u>sort</u> in the following ways:

        *  As <u>sort</u> <b>-u</b> suppresses lines with duplicate keys, it suppresses lines that collate equally but are not
           identical.

        *  The output of <u>sort</u> (without <b>-u</b>) can contain identical lines that are not adjacent,  if  it  does  not
           implement the recommended further byte-by-byte comparison of lines that collate equally. This affects
           the use of <u>sort</u> with <u>comm</u> and <u>uniq</u>; see the APPLICATION USAGE for those utilities.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. The following command sorts the contents of <b>infile</b> with the second field as the sort key:

               sort -k 2,2 infile

        2. The  following  command  sorts,  in  reverse  order, the contents of <b>infile1</b> and <b>infile2</b>, placing the
           output in <b>outfile</b> and using the second character of the second field as the sort key  (assuming  that
           the first character of the second field is the field separator):

               sort -r -o outfile -k 2.2,2.2 infile1 infile2

        3. The  following  command sorts the contents of <b>infile1</b> and <b>infile2</b> using the second non-&lt;blank&gt; of the
           second field as the sort key:

               sort -k 2.2b,2.2b infile1 infile2

        4. The following command prints the System V password file (user database) sorted by the numeric user ID
           (the third &lt;colon&gt;-separated field):

               sort -t : -k 3,3n <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>

        5. The following command prints the lines of the already sorted file <b>infile</b>,  suppressing  all  but  one
           occurrence of lines having the same third field:

               sort -um -k 3.1,3.0 infile

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Examples  in  some  historical documentation state that options <b>-um</b> with one input file keep the first in
       each set of lines with equal keys. This behavior was deemed to be an implementation artifact and was  not
       standardized.

       The  <b>-z</b>  option  was  omitted; it is not standard practice on most systems and is inconsistent with using
       <u>sort</u> to sort several files individually  and  then  merge  them  together.  The  text  concerning  <b>-z</b>  in
       historical documentation appeared to require implementations to determine the proper buffer length during
       the sort phase of operation, but not during the merge.

       The  <b>-y</b>  option  was  omitted because of non-portability. The <b>-M</b> option, present in System V, was omitted
       because of non-portability in international usage.

       An undocumented <b>-T</b> option exists in  some  implementations.  It  is  used  to  specify  a  directory  for
       intermediate  files. Implementations are encouraged to support the use of the <u>TMPDIR</u> environment variable
       instead of adding an option to support this functionality.

       The <b>-k</b> option was added to satisfy two objections. First, the zero-based counting used  by  <u>sort</u>  is  not
       consistent with other utility conventions. Second, it did not meet syntax guideline requirements.

       Historical  documentation indicates that ``setting <b>-n</b> implies <b>-b</b>''.  The description of <b>-n</b> already states
       that optional leading &lt;blank&gt;s are tolerated in doing the comparison.  If  <b>-b</b>  is  enabled,  rather  than
       implied,  by  <b>-n</b>,  this  has unusual side-effects. When a character offset is used in a column of numbers
       (for example, to sort modulo 100), that offset is measured relative to the most significant digit, not to
       the column.  Based upon a recommendation from the author of the original <u>sort</u> utility, the <b>-b</b> implication
       has been omitted from this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, and an application wishing to achieve  the  previously
       mentioned side-effects has to code the <b>-b</b> flag explicitly.

       Earlier  versions  of  this  standard allowed the <b>-o</b> option to appear after operands. Historical practice
       allowed all options to be interspersed with operands. This version of the standard allows implementations
       to accept options after operands but conforming applications should not use this form.

       Earlier versions of this standard also allowed the <b>-</b><u>number</u> and <b>+</b><u>number</u>  options.  These  options  are  no
       longer specified by POSIX.1‐2008 but may be present in some implementations.

       Historical  implementations  produced  a message on standard error when <b>-c</b> was specified and disorder was
       detected, and when <b>-c</b> and <b>-u</b> were specified and a duplicate key was detected. An earlier version of  this
       standard  contained  wording  that  did  not  make  it  clear  that  this  message  was  allowed and some
       implementations removed this message to be sure that  they  conformed  to  the  standard's  requirements.
       Confronted  with  this  difference  in  behavior,  interactive users that wanted to be sure that they got
       visual feedback instead of just exit code 1 could have used a command like:

           sort -c file || echo disorder

       whether or not the <u>sort</u> utility provided a message in this case. But, it was not easy for a user to  find
       where the disorder or duplicate key occurred on implementations that do not produce a message, especially
       when  some  parts  of the input line were not part of the key and when one or more of the <b>-b</b>, <b>-d</b>, <b>-f</b>, <b>-i</b>,
       <b>-n</b>, or <b>-</b>r options or <u>keydef</u> type modifiers were in use. POSIX.1‐2008 requires a message to be produced in
       this case. POSIX.1‐2008 also contains the <b>-C</b> option giving users the ability to choose either behavior.

       When a disorder or duplicate is found when the <b>-c</b> option  is  specified,  some  implementations  print  a
       message  containing  the  first  line  that  is  out of order or contains a duplicate key; others print a
       message specifying the line number of the offending line. This standard allows either type of message.

       Implementations are encouraged to perform the recommended further byte-by-byte comparison of  lines  that
       collate  equally,  even  though  this may affect efficiency. The impact on efficiency can be mitigated by
       only performing the additional comparison if the current locale's collating  sequence  does  not  have  a
       total  ordering  of  all  characters  (if  the  implementation  provides  a way to query this) or by only
       performing the additional comparison if the locale name associated with the LC_COLLATE  category  has  an
       <b>'@'</b>  modifier  in  the  name  (since  locales without an <b>'@'</b> modifier should have a total ordering of all
       characters — see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>7.3.2</u>, <u>LC_COLLATE</u>).  Note  that  if
       the  implementation provides a <u>stable</u> <u>sort</u> option as an extension (usually <b>-s</b>), the additional comparison
       should not be performed when this option has been specified.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A future version of this standard may require that if the collating sequence of the current  locale  does
       not  have a total ordering of all characters, any lines of input that collate equally when comparing them
       as whole lines are further compared byte-by-byte using the collating sequence for the POSIX locale.
