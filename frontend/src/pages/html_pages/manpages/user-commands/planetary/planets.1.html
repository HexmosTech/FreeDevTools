</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       planets - Gravitational simulation of planetary bodies

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Planets</b>  is  a  simple interactive program for playing with simulations of planetary systems. It is great
       teaching tool for understanding how gravitation works on a planetary level.

       The user interface is aimed at being simple enough for a fairly  young  kid  can  get  some  joy  of  it.
       There's  also  a  special  kid-mode  aimed  at very young children which grabs the focus and converts key
       banging into lots of random planets.

</pre><h4><b>KEYBINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Universe</b> <b>definition</b>
       a      Add Planet

       j      Place random orbital planet

       r      Place random planet

       u      Undo (undoes last planet insertion)

       e      Reset to empty universe

       g      Go Back (goes back to just after last planet insertion)

       Mouse  Click on a planet to delete it

   <b>Physics</b>
       b      Toggle bounce (experimental)

   <b>Display</b> <b>control</b>
       Cursor keys
              Panning

       c, Space
              Move display to center of mass

       x      Initiate center of mass tracking

       =      Zoom in

       -      Zoom out

       p      Toggle Pause

       o      Change all colors randomly

       t      Toggle Trace

       d      Double Trace Length

       h      Halve Trace Length

       Mouse  Drag a box around a set of planets to follow the center of mass of those planets

   <b>Program</b> <b>control</b>
       H      Display help dialog

       k      Display option dialog

       Ctrl-Shift-k
              Toggle kid-mode.  Kid mode locks the keyboard and mouse, so the only way to get out is  to  toggle
              kid-mode again to get out.

       l      Load  Universe  After  pressing  l, press any other character to load the universe with that name.
              Universes are stored in <a href="file:~/.planets/">~/.planets/</a> .

       s      Save Universe After pressing s, press any other character to save the  universe  with  that  name.
              Universes are saved in <a href="file:~/.planets/">~/.planets/</a> .

</pre><h4><b>TECHNICAL</b> <b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Planets</b>  uses  a  fourth-order  runge-kutta  approximation for the simulation itself.  Planet bouncing is
       achieved by adding a repulsive force to planets at close quarters.  <b>Planets</b> is fairly flexible:  you  can
       change  the  gravitational  constant, the time-slice of the simulation, and even the exponent used in the
       gravitational law.  Universes are saved in the <a href="file:~/.planets">~/.planets</a> directory, and are simple  human  readable  and
       editable files.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Currently  bouncing doesn't work very well unless you make the time-slice quite small.  Ideally, it would
       be nice to have a billiard-style bounce system, but it's not clear how  to  do  this  accurately  in  the
       presence of a strong gravitational field.
