       jh_compilefeatures - Compiles eclipse features using pde-build.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jh_compilefeatures</b> [<u>debhelper</u> <u>options</u>] [<u>options</u>] [<b>--pde-build-dir=</b><u>dir</u>] [<u>feature</u> <u>[...]</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       jh_compilefeatures is a javahelper program that handles compiling features using pde-build. These
       features can be specified either in debian/eclipse.features or via command-line.

       jh_compilefeatures uses debhelper behind the scenes and are therefore subject to the compat level (e.g.
       when parsing the eclipse.features file).

       When specifying the dependencies for a feature, jh_compilefeatures will see if this feature has just been
       compiled and will use the dependency if it is among the results. This can be used together with
       debian/eclipse.features.

       Dependencies are always resolved by first checking if it is a recently built feature and if not, then the
       system installed eclipse's dropins folders will be checked.

       Currently jh_compilefeatures do not clean up between builds, which means the dependencies for previous
       builds are present for the current build.  Nevertheless, do not rely on this, as this behavior is subject
       to change.

       Note: jh_compilefeatures will <u>not</u> rearrange the build order for you in order to do this.

       Note: that jh_compilefeatures will not error out if it cannot find a missing dependency. This is due to
       the underlying builder being unable to detect this.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       debian/eclipse.features
           List  the  eclipse  features  to  compile  and  their dependencies. The first item on the line is the
           feature to compile and the following items are considered dependencies.

           A dependency can either be a dropins folder or a previous  built  feature.   jh_compilefeatures  will
           find  it  as  long  as  it  is  installed  in the system eclipse's dropins folder or it has just been
           compiled.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--pde-build-dir=</b><u>dir</u>
           Specifies the directory from where pde-build is to be run. Defaults to "debian/.eclipse_build".

       <b>--feature-deps=</b><u>deps</u>
           A space separated list of dependencies. These dependencies will  be  used  to  compile  all  features
           passed by command-line. Features read from debian/eclipse.features are unaffected by this.

       <b>--build-opts=</b><u>args</u>
           Pass args to the underlying builder. These options are passed to all features built.

           This  defaults  to "-DjavacTarget=1.5 -DjavacSource=1.5" if not set.  This can be disabled by passing
           the empty string.

       <b>--jvm-args=</b><u>args</u>
           Pass args to the JVM. These options are passed to all features built.

       <b>--orbit-dir=</b><u>dir</u>
           Specifies where the Orbit dependencies can be found. This is only needed if the orbit dir  is  in  an
           unusual location.

       <b>--pde-build=</b><u>cmd</u>
           Use a non-standard pde-build command to compile the features.

       <b>--pde-args=args</b>
           Passes args directly to pde-build. Note, jh_compilefeatures have specialised options for some of pde-
           build options and these should be used whenever possible.

           These options are passed to all features built.

       <b>--ignore-java-home</b>
           Skip  the  check  of JAVA_HOME. Since the underlying builder uses ant (and therefore java), the build
           should ensure it always uses the expected java implementation.

           Use this if you (for whatever reason) need to declare the specific java implementation without  being
           able to use JAVA_HOME.

           Note: You still have to tell the underlying builder which java to use.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       A sample debian/eclipse.features

         org.eclipse.tm.terminal emf
         org.eclipse.rse.sdk

       org.eclipse.tm.terminal  depends  on  "emf",  which  is expected to be found in eclipse's dropins folder.
       org.eclipse.rse.sdk on the other hand has no dependencies beyond the eclipse platform.

       If needed you can also specify a previously built feature as a dependency:

         org.eclipse.some.feature
         org.eclipse.another.feature org.eclipse.some.feature rse

       Here org.eclipse.another.feature depends org.eclipse.some.feature, which was just  built  and  also  rse,
       which is expected to be in system installed eclipse's dropins.

       This  program  is  a  part  of  javahelper  and  uses  debhelper  as backend. There are also tutorials in
       /usr/share/doc/javahelper.
