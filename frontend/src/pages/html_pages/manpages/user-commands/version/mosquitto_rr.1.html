</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mosquitto_rr</b> is an MQTT version 5/3.1.1 client that can be used to publish a request message and wait for
       a response. When using MQTT v5, which is the default, <b>mosquitto_rr</b> will use the Request-Response feature.

       The important options are <b>-t</b>, <b>-e</b>, and one of <b>-f</b>, <b>-m</b>, <b>-n</b>, and <b>-s</b>.

       Example: mosquitto_rr -t request-topic -e response-topic -m message

</pre><h4><b>ENCRYPTED</b> <b>CONNECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mosquitto_rr</b> supports TLS encrypted connections. It is strongly recommended that you use an encrypted
       connection for anything more than the most basic setup.

       To enable TLS connections when using x509 certificates, one of either <b>--cafile</b> or <b>--capath</b> can be
       provided as an option.

       Alternatively, if the <b>-p</b> <b>8883</b> option is used then the OS provided certificates will be loaded and neither
       <b>--cafile</b> or <b>--capath</b> are needed

       To enable TLS connections when using TLS-PSK, you must use the <b>--psk</b> and the <b>--psk-identity</b> options.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options below may be given on the command line, but may also be placed in a config file located at
       <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mosquitto_rr</b> or <b>$HOME/.config/mosquitto_rr</b> with one pair of <b>-option</b> <u>value</u> per line. The
       values in the config file will be used as defaults and can be overridden by using the command line. The
       exceptions to this is <b>-t</b>, which if given in the config file will not be overridden. Note also that
       currently some options cannot be negated, e.g.  <b>-S</b>. Config file lines that have a <b>#</b> as the first
       character are treated as comments and not processed any further.

       <b>-A</b>
           Bind the outgoing connection to a local ip address/hostname. Use this argument if you need to
           restrict network communication to a particular interface.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--disable-clean-session</b>
           Disable 'clean session' / enable persistent client mode. When this argument is used, the broker will
           be instructed not to clean existing sessions for the same client id when the client connects, and
           sessions will never expire when the client disconnects. MQTT v5 clients can change their session
           expiry interval with the <b>-x</b> argument.

           When a session is persisted on the broker, the subscriptions for the client will be maintained after
           it disconnects, along with subsequent QoS 1 and QoS 2 messages that arrive. When the client
           reconnects and does not clean the session, it will receive all of the queued messages.

           If using this option, the client id must be set manually with <b>--id</b>

       <b>--cafile</b>
           Define the path to a file containing PEM encoded CA certificates that are trusted. Used to enable SSL
           communication.

           See also <b>--capath</b>

       <b>--capath</b>
           Define the path to a directory containing PEM encoded CA certificates that are trusted. Used to
           enable SSL communication.

           For <b>--capath</b> to work correctly, the certificate files must have ".crt" as the file ending and you
           must run "openssl rehash &lt;path to capath&gt;" each time you add/remove a certificate.

           See also <b>--cafile</b>

       <b>--cert</b>
           Define the path to a file containing a PEM encoded certificate for this client, if required by the
           server.

           See also <b>--key</b> and the Encrypted Connections section.

       <b>--ciphers</b>
           An openssl compatible list of TLS ciphers to support in the client. See <b><a href="../man1/ciphers.1.html">ciphers</a></b>(1) for more
           information.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
           Enable debug messages.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--property</b>
           Use an MQTT v5 property with this publish. If you use this option, the client will be set to be an
           MQTT v5 client. This option has two forms:

           <b>-D</b> <b>command</b> <b>identifier</b> <b>value</b>

           <b>-D</b> <b>command</b> <b>identifier</b> <b>name</b> <b>value</b>

           <b>command</b> is the MQTT command/packet identifier and can be one of CONNECT, PUBACK, PUBREC, PUBCOMP,
           SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, DISCONNECT, AUTH, or WILL. The properties available for each command are
           listed in the Properties section.

           <b>identifier</b> is the name of the property to add. This is as described in the specification, but with
           '-' as a word separator. For example: <b>payload-format-indicator</b>. More details are in the Properties
           section.

           <b>value</b> is the value of the property to add, with a data type that is property specific.

           <b>name</b> is only used for the <b>user-property</b> property as the first of the two strings in the string pair.
           In that case, <b>value</b> is the second of the strings in the pair.

       <b>-e</b>
           Response topic. The client will subscribe to this topic to wait for a response.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--file</b>
           Send the contents of a file as the request message.

       <b>-F</b>
           Specify output printing format. This option allows you to choose what information from each message
           is printed to the screen. See the Output Format section below for full details.

           This option overrides the <b>-v</b> option, but does not override the <b>-N</b> option.

       <b>--help</b>
           Display usage information.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--host</b>
           Specify the host to connect to. Defaults to localhost.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--id</b>
           The id to use for this client. If not given, a client id will be generated depending on the MQTT
           version being used. For v3.1.1/v3.1, the client generates a client id in the format
           <b>mosq-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b>, where the <b>X</b> are replaced with random alphanumeric characters. For v5.0, the
           client sends a zero length client id, and the server will generate a client id for the client.

           This option cannot be used at the same time as the <b>--id-prefix</b> argument.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--id-prefix</b>
           Provide a prefix that the client id will be built from by appending the process id of the client.
           This is useful where the broker is using the clientid_prefixes option. Cannot be used at the same
           time as the <b>--id</b> argument.

       <b>--insecure</b>
           When using certificate based encryption, this option disables verification of the server hostname in
           the server certificate. This can be useful when testing initial server configurations but makes it
           possible for a malicious third party to impersonate your server through DNS spoofing, for example.
           Use this option in testing <u>only</u>. If you need to resort to using this option in a production
           environment, your setup is at fault and there is no point using encryption.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keepalive</b>
           The number of seconds between sending PING commands to the broker for the purposes of informing it we
           are still connected and functioning. Defaults to 60 seconds.

       <b>--key</b>
           Define the path to a file containing a PEM encoded private key for this client, if required by the
           server.

           See also <b>--cert</b> and the Encrypted Connections section.

       <b>--keyform</b>
           Specifies the type of private key in use when making TLS connections.. This can be "pem" or "engine".
           This parameter is useful when a TPM module is being used and the private key has been created with
           it. Defaults to "pem", which means normal private key files are used.

           See also <b>--tls-engine</b>.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--url</b>
           Specify specify user, password, hostname, port and topic at once as a URL. The URL must be in the
           form: mqtt(s)://[username[:password]@]host[:port]/topic

           If the scheme is mqtt:// then the port defaults to 1883. If the scheme is mqtts:// then the port
           defaults to 8883.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--message</b>
           Send a single request message from the command line.

       <b>-N</b>
           Do not append an end of line character to the payload when printing. This allows streaming of payload
           data from multiple messages directly to another application unmodified. Only really makes sense when
           not using <b>-v</b>.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--null-message</b>
           Send a null (zero length) request message.

       <b>--nodelay</b>
           Disable Nagle's algorithm for the socket. This means that latency of sent messages is reduced, which
           is particularly noticeable for small, reasonably infrequent messages. Using this option may result in
           more packets being sent than would normally be necessary.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--port</b>
           Connect to the port specified. If not given, the default of 1883 for plain MQTT or 8883 for MQTT over
           TLS will be used.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--pw</b>
           Provide a password to be used for authenticating with the broker. Using this argument without also
           specifying a username is invalid when using MQTT v3.1 or v3.1.1. See also the <b>--username</b> option.

       <b>--pretty</b>
           When using the JSON output format %j or %J, the default is to print in an unformatted fashion.
           Specifying <b>--pretty</b> prints messages in a prettier, more human readable format.

       <b>--proxy</b>
           Specify a SOCKS5 proxy to connect through. "None" and "username" authentication types are supported.
           The <b>socks-url</b> must be of the form <b>socks5h://[username[:password]@]host[:port]</b>. The protocol prefix
           <b>socks5h</b> means that hostnames are resolved by the proxy. The symbols %25, %3A and %40 are URL decoded
           into %, : and @ respectively, if present in the username or password.

           If username is not given, then no authentication is attempted. If the port is not given, then the
           default of 1080 is used.

           More SOCKS versions may be available in the future, depending on demand, and will use different
           protocol prefixes as described in <b><a href="../man1/curl.1.html">curl</a></b>(1).

       <b>--psk</b>
           Provide the hexadecimal (no leading 0x) pre-shared-key matching the one used on the broker to use
           TLS-PSK encryption support.  <b>--psk-identity</b> must also be provided to enable TLS-PSK.

       <b>--psk-identity</b>
           The client identity to use with TLS-PSK support. This may be used instead of a username if the broker
           is configured to do so.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--qos</b>
           Specify the quality of service desired for the incoming messages, from 0, 1 and 2. Defaults to 0. See
           <b><a href="../man7/mqtt.7.html">mqtt</a></b>(7) for more information on QoS.

           The QoS is identical for all topics subscribed to in a single instance of mosquitto_rr.

       <b>--quiet</b>
           If this argument is given, no runtime errors will be printed. This excludes any error messages given
           in case of invalid user input (e.g. using <b>--port</b> without a port).

       <b>-R</b>
           If this argument is given, messages that are received that have the retain bit set will not be
           printed. Messages with retain set are "stale", in that it is not known when they were originally
           published. When subscribing to a wildcard topic there may be a large number of retained messages.
           This argument suppresses their display.

       <b>-S</b>
           Use SRV lookups to determine which host to connect to. Performs lookups to <b>_mqtt._tcp.&lt;host&gt;</b> when
           used in conjunction with <b>-h</b>, otherwise uses <b>_mqtt._tcp.&lt;local</b> <b>dns</b> <b>domain&gt;</b>.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--stdin-file</b>
           Send a request message read from stdin, sending the entire content as a single message.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--topic</b>
           The MQTT topic where the request message will be sent.

       <b>--tls-alpn</b>
           Provide a protocol to use when connecting to a broker that has multiple protocols available on a
           single port, e.g. MQTT and WebSockets.

       <b>--tls-engine</b>
           A valid openssl engine id. These can be listed with openssl engine command.

           See also <b>--keyform</b>.

       <b>--tls-engine-kpass-sha1</b>
           SHA1 of the private key password when using an TLS engine. Some TLS engines such as the TPM engine
           may require the use of a password in order to be accessed. This option allows a hex encoded SHA1 hash
           of the password to the engine directly, instead of the user being prompted for the password.

           See also <b>--tls-engine</b>.

       <b>--tls-use-os-certs</b>
           If used, this will load and trust the OS provided CA certificates. This can be used in conjunction
           with <b>--cafile</b> and <b>--capath</b> and can be used on its own to enable TLS mode. This will be set by default
           if <b>-L</b> <b>mqtts://...</b>  is used, or if port is 8883 and no other certificate options are used.

       <b>--tls-version</b>
           Choose which TLS protocol version to use when communicating with the broker. Valid options are
           <b>tlsv1.3</b>, <b>tlsv1.2</b> and <b>tlsv1.1</b>. The default value is <b>tlsv1.2</b>. Must match the protocol version used by
           the broker.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--username</b>
           Provide a username to be used for authenticating with the broker. See also the <b>--pw</b> argument.

       <b>--unix</b>
           Connect to a broker through a local unix domain socket instead of a TCP socket. This is a replacement
           for <b>-h</b> and <b>-L</b>. For example: <b>mosquitto_pub</b> <b>--unix</b> <b>/tmp/mosquitto.sock</b> <b>...</b>

           See the <b>socket_domain</b> option in <b><a href="../man5/mosquitto.conf.5.html">mosquitto.conf</a></b>(5) to configure Mosquitto to listen on a unix socket.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print received messages verbosely. With this argument, messages will be printed as "topic payload".
           When this argument is not given, the messages are printed as "payload".

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--protocol-version</b>
           Specify which version of the MQTT protocol should be used when connecting to the rmeote broker. Can
           be <b>5</b>, <b>311</b>, <b>31</b>, or the more verbose <b>mqttv5</b>, <b>mqttv311</b>, or <b>mqttv31</b>. Defaults to <b>5</b>.

       <b>-W</b>
           Provide a timeout as an integer number of seconds. mosquitto_sub will stop processing messages and
           disconnect after this number of seconds has passed. The timeout starts just after the client has
           connected to the broker.

       <b>--will-payload</b>
           Specify a message that will be stored by the broker and sent out if this client disconnects
           unexpectedly. This must be used in conjunction with <b>--will-topic</b>.

       <b>--will-qos</b>
           The QoS to use for the Will. Defaults to 0. This must be used in conjunction with <b>--will-topic</b>.

       <b>--will-retain</b>
           If given, if the client disconnects unexpectedly the message sent out will be treated as a retained
           message. This must be used in conjunction with <b>--will-topic</b>.

       <b>--will-topic</b>
           The topic on which to send a Will, in the event that the client disconnects unexpectedly.

       <b>-x</b>
           Set the session-expiry-interval property on the CONNECT packet. Applies to MQTT v5 clients only. Set
           to 0-4294967294 to specify the session will expire in that many seconds after the client disconnects,
           or use -1, 4294967295, or ∞ for a session that does not expire. Defaults to -1 if -c is also given,
           or 0 if -c not given.

           If the session is set to never expire, either with -x or -c, then a client id must be provided.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       There are three ways of formatting the output from mosquitto_rr. In all cases a new-line character is
       appended for each message received unless the <b>-N</b> argument is passed to mosquitto_rr.

       Payload-only is the default output format and will print the payload exactly as it is received.

       Verbose mode is activated with <b>-v</b> and prints the message topic and the payload, separated by a space.

       The final option is formatted output, which allows the user to define a custom output format. The
       behaviour is controlled with the <b>-F</b> <b>format-string</b> option. The format string is a free text string where
       interpreted sequences are replaced by different parameters. The available interpreted sequences are
       described below.

       Three characters are used to start an interpreted sequence: <b>%</b>, <b>@</b> and <b>\</b>. Sequences starting with <b>%</b> are
       either parameters related to the MQTT message being printed, or are helper sequences to avoid the need to
       type long date format strings for example. Sequences starting with <b>@</b> are passed to the <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3)
       function (with the @ replaced with a % - note that only the character immediately after the @ is passed
       to strftime). This allows the construction of a wide variety of time based outputs. The output options
       for strftime vary from platform to platform, so please check what is available for your platform.
       mosquitto_rr does provide one extension to strftime which is <b>@N</b>, which can be used to obtain the number
       of nanoseconds passed in the current second. The resolution of this option varies depending on the
       platform. The final sequence character is <b>\</b>, which is used to input some characters that would otherwise
       be difficult to enter.

       •   <b>%I</b> ISO-8601 format date and time, e.g. 2016-08-10T09:47:38+0100

       •   <b>%j</b> JSON output of message parameters and timestamp, with a quoted and escaped payload. For example
           {"tst":"2020-05-06T22:12:00.000000+0100","topic":"greeting","qos":0,"retain":0,"payload":"hello
           world"}

       •   <b>%J</b> JSON output of message parameters and timestamp, with a non-quoted and non-escaped payload - this
           means the payload must itself be valid JSON. For example:
           {"tst":"2020-05-06T22:12:00.000000+0100","topic":"foo","qos":0,"retain":0,"payload":{"temperature":27.0,"humidity":57}}.

           If the payload is not valid JSON, then the error message "Error: Message payload is not valid JSON on
           topic &lt;topic&gt;" will be printed to stderr.

       •   <b>%I</b> ISO-8601 format date and time, e.g. 2016-08-10T09:47:38+0100

       •   <b>%U</b> Unix timestamp with nanoseconds, e.g. 1470818943.786368637

   <b>Time</b> <b>related</b> <b>parameters</b>
       •   <b>@@</b> a literal @.

       •   <b>@X</b> pass the character represented by <b>X</b> to the strftime function as <b>%X</b>. The options supported are
           platform dependent.

       •   <b>@N</b> the number of nanoseconds that have passed in the current second, with varying timing resolution
           depending on platform.

   <b>Escape</b> <b>characters</b>
       •   <b>\\</b> a literal \.

       •   <b>\0</b> a null character. Can be used to separate different parameters that may contain spaces (e.g.
           topic, payload) so that processing with tools such as <b><a href="../man1/xargs.1.html">xargs</a></b>(1) is easier.

       •   <b>\a</b> alert/bell.

       •   <b>\e</b> the escape sequence, which can be used with ANSI colour codes to provide coloured output for
           example.

       •   <b>\n</b> end of line.

       •   <b>\r</b> carriage return.

       •   <b>\t</b> horizontal tab.

       •   <b>\v</b> vertical tab.

</pre><h4><b>WILLS</b></h4><pre>
       mosquitto_rr can register a message with the broker that will be sent out if it disconnects unexpectedly.
       See <b><a href="../man7/mqtt.7.html">mqtt</a></b>(7) for more information.

       The minimum requirement for this is to use <b>--will-topic</b> to specify which topic the will should be sent
       out on. This will result in a non-retained, zero length message with QoS 0.

       Use the <b>--will-retain</b>, <b>--will-payload</b> and <b>--will-qos</b> arguments to modify the other will parameters.

</pre><h4><b>PROPERTIES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-D</b> / <b>--property</b> option allows adding properties to different stages of the mosquitto_rr run. The
       properties supported for each command are as follows:
