</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       Features as described on the fossil home page.

       1.   <b>Integrated</b>  <b>Bug</b>  <b>Tracking,</b>  <b>Wiki,</b>  <b>Forum,</b>  <b>and</b>  <b>Technotes</b> - In addition to doing distributed version
              control like Git and Mercurial, Fossil also supports bug tracking, wiki, forum, and technotes.

       2.  <b>Built-in</b> <b>Web</b> <b>Interface</b> - Fossil has a built-in and intuitive  web  interface  that  promotes  project
              situational  awareness.  Type  "fossil  ui" and Fossil automatically opens a web browser to a page
              that shows detailed graphical history and status information on that project.

       3.  <b>Self-Contained</b> - Fossil is  a  single  self-contained  stand-alone  executable.  To  install,  simply
              download  a precompiled binary for Linux, Mac, OpenBSD, or Windows and put it on your $PATH. Easy-
              to-compile source code is available for users on other platforms.

       4.  <b>Simple</b> <b>Networking</b> - No custom protocols or TCP ports. Fossil uses plain old HTTP (or  HTTPS  or  SSH)
              for  all  network  communications,  so  it works fine from behind restrictive firewalls, including
              proxies. The protocol is bandwidth efficient to the point that Fossil can be used comfortably over
              dial-up or over the exceedingly slow Wifi on airliners.

       5.  <b>CGI/SCGI</b> <b>Enabled</b> - No server is required, but if you want to set one up, Fossil  supports  four  easy
              server configurations.

       6.   <b>Autosync</b>  -  Fossil supports "autosync" mode which helps to keep projects moving forward by reducing
              the amount of needless forking and merging often associated with distributed projects.

       7.  <b>Robust</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Reliable</b> - Fossil stores content using an enduring file format in an SQLite database so that
              transactions are atomic even if interrupted by a power loss or system crash. Automatic self-checks
              verify that all aspects of the repository are consistent prior to each commit.

       8.  <b>Free</b> <b>and</b> <b>Open-Source</b> - Uses the 2-clause BSD license.
