       makepp_release_notes -- Major changes in each version of makepp

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Version</b> <b>2.1</b> <b>(under</b> <b>development)</b>
       •   Builtin &amp;template mini-language documentation rewritten.  It now has an "@include(<u>filename</u>)@" macro.

       •   C Scanner now takes into account compiler specific path variables like "C_INCLUDE_PATH" or "LIB".

       •   Parens now nest as in GNU make or Shell: "$(name ...()...)"

       •   New environment variable "MAKEPP_DEBUG".

       •   Installation defaults for html-doc and man have changed slightly.

       •   The new option "--loop" is the successor to "--stop-after-loading", which it enhances to get the head
           start for every edit compile cycle in an endless loop.

       •   The  "include"  statements  and  the functions "find-first-upwards" and "find-upwards" will no longer
           search higher than a <u>RootMakeppfile</u>, if one is present.

       •   The gmake style of putting the rule to make an include  file  after  the  include  statement  is  not
           recommended, but now supported.  Thus the option "--defer-include" has been removed.

       •   All    pre-2.0    features    which    issued    deprecated-warnings    are    eliminated,   as   are
           $Mpp::Makefile::legacy_functions and $MAKEPP_INSTALL_OLD_MODULES.

       •   You can use the new makeppinfo, mppi option "--unremembered" to spot no longer needed files.

       •   You can use the new makeppreplay, mppr option "--sed" to replay a command differently, e.g.  to  stop
           after preprocessing or to add debugging options to the linker.

       •   There  was  an  undocumented (and slightly buggy) feature whereby making <u>.makepp/log</u> unwritable would
           suppress logging.  Now instead it falls back to "--verbose", so you must pass "--no-log" if you  want
           that.   This  option  and  a  few  others were also already available for makeppreplay, mppr, but not
           documented.

       •   At least Perl 5.8 is required.

   <b>Version</b> <b>2.0</b> <b>(March</b> <b>2012)</b>
       The items are roughly ordered by increasing age, so you need to read only the first parts if you've  been
       using snapshots newer than 1.40.

       •   The  signature  statement  no  longer  overrides  the method found by command parsers -- now you must
           provide the "override" keyword if  you  want  that.   There  are  new  signature  methods  "xml"  and
           "xml-space".   The  "c_compilation_md5"  signature can now also be invoked as "C" (because signatures
           pertain to files, not actions).  It (and its subclasses) can now easily be extended to other suffixes
           as in "C.ipp,tpp" meaning that besides the built in suffixes it will also apply to  files  ending  in
           <u>.ipp</u>  or <u>.tpp</u>.  Thanks to this makeppreplay and embedded SQL/C now works more reliably.  <b>Beware:</b> <b>this</b>
           <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>understood</b> <b>by</b> <b>older</b> <b>versions.</b>  <b>So</b> <b>don't</b> <b>call</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> <b>mpp</b> <b>on</b> <b>things</b> <b>built</b> <b>with</b>  <b>this</b>  <b>version,</b>
           <b>which</b> <b>includes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>repository</b> <b>you</b> <b>built</b> <b>in.</b>

       •   The  keyword "global" can precede the "build_cache", "build_check" and "signature" statements and the
           "define" statement which now also allows "export".  Therefore s_ subs now get a 4th parameter, a hash
           reference with the encountered keywords as keys.

       •   Makefiles are now parsed with the same priority as in gmake.  Hence "include :" or  "include  ="  are
           now  statements  (no space: still rule or assignment.)  This means that "perl { qualified::name }" no
           longer mysteriously disapears (it used to be  a  useless  rule.)   Now  variable  names  may  contain
           whitespace.   This  means  that "&amp;preprocess --assignment" will treat just about any equal sign as an
           assignment (replace them with $E from the funny assignment "E==".)

       •   If you have a federated build cache over several disks, and some of them are preferred, you must edit
           their build_cache_options.pl and change PREFERRED to xPREFERRED.  (This reflects a general change  in
           names where we now prefix by 'x' all xATTRIBUTES which are are true iff they exist).

       •   The "VPATH" variable and "vpath" statement are now emulated.

       •   Makefile functions ("sub f_...") may now get their 1st parameter as a string reference.  In that case
           you  are  responsible  for  expanding  your  arguments.   Use  the  accessor functions &amp;arg or "args"
           described in makepp extensions.  Until you get round to updating your functions, you  can  turn  this
           off  by  setting "$Mpp::Makefile::legacy_functions = 1" either in your makefile (one per build system
           is enough, as it's a Perl variable) or patch it into your new makepp installation.  If you want  your
           updated  functions  to work with both your old and this new makepp, use "ref $_[0] ? &amp;arg : $_[0]" or
           "ref $_[0] ? args(...) : $_[0]" in the transition phase.

           Within "$(call)", the special variables "$0, $1, ..., $(11), ..." are now  expanded  like  any  other
           make  variable.  This causes slight differences to the previous work around.  The result is closer to
           gmake, at least if "makepp_simple_concatenation=1" is set.

       •   CMake generated makefiles no longer lead to deep recursion.

       •   New scanner "esql_compilation" for embedded SQL C, now covers all databases.   You  must  supply  the
           rules, however.

       •   New  option  --hybrid-recursive-make  (follow  each  option  link, to see shorter forms) as a smarter
           alternative to --traditional-recursive-make.

           New option --stop-after-loading gives makepp a headstart while you're still editing.

           New options --rm-stale,  --sandbox  and  --dont-read,  for  sandbox  control  when  running  multiple
           concurrent (possibly distributed) makepp commands.

           Makepp  will  now  also  look  for  options in files called <u>.makepprc</u>.  The option --args-file is now
           consistently available on all commands.

           The    environment    variable     MAKEPP_CASE_SENSITIVE_FILENAMES     supercedes     the     options
           --case-sensitive-filenames and --no-case-sensitive-filenames.

           Removed "--keep-repository-links" option, the behaviour of which is now the default.

           All utilities now also query an environment variable for presetting options.  Each one is called like
           the utility in upper case, with FLAGS added, e.g. $MAKEPPCLEANFLAGS or $MAKEPPLOGFLAGS.

           Short  command  line options may now be grouped in the Unix way, so "-k -j 4" may be given as "-kj4".
           In all long options the dash between words may now  consistently  be  omitted  or  replaced  with  an
           underscore, so that "--no-log" can be "--nolog" or "--no_log".  Unknown options now cause an error.

       •   Originally  "makeppclean"  "-l"  meant "--leave-src-info", but now the options have been extended and
           this one changed to "-k|--keep-src-info".

       •   Scanning terminology has been cleaned up (and the page rewritten) to finally match  a  redesign  that
           happened a few years ago.  There are now 3 separate terms, the lexer (which users don't need to worry
           about), the (command) parsers and the (file) scanners.

           For  advanced users: The new interface consists of the "register_parser" or "register_command_parser"
           statements, the ":parser" rule option and the "p_*" parser factory functions  which  get  aliased  to
           their  parser  class as "factory".  The misnamed "register_scanner" statement, ":scanner" rule option
           and ":scanner_*" or ":parser_*" functions are deprecated.

       •   New variable MAKEPP_VERSION.

       •   All internal classes have been moved to the new package "Mpp::" so as to abide by CPAN rules, and  to
           avoid potential collision with any module you might load into your makefiles.  This is transparent to
           casual users of makepp.

           In  case  you  did Perl programming for your makefiles, and you made use of some internals this would
           break your build.  Therefore there is a temporary backward compatibility feature, to  be  removed  in
           the   future,   which   you   can   activate  during  installation.   The  new  environment  variable
           $MAKEPP_INSTALL_OLD_MODULES is checked for a list of old modules you want created as wrappers  around
           the  new  ones.   Additionally  if  you  have makefiles you can't quickly change, which rely on these
           things being available without a "use" statement, you must prefix those modules with a  "+",  to  get
           them preloaded:

               MAKEPP_INSTALL_OLD_MODULES='+Glob Rule +MakeEvent'

       •   New  makeppreplay,  mppr  utility  to repeat some of makepp's actions very fast.  New makepplog, mppl
           utility to see the log data readably, needed due to a changed file  format.   New  makeppgraph,  mppg
           utility  to  graphically analyze dependencies, includes and partially the reasons for a rebuild.  New
           makeppinfo, mppi utility to see somewhat cryptically what makepp knows about some file.

       •   Ported to IBM z/OS Unix System Services.  Only smart recursive make doesn't work.

       •   Makepp has become noticeably faster.

       •   Abolish the undocumented fancy renaming of only '.' to '_dot_' in variable and function names.

       •   New variable $/ for portable directory separator.  Lots of Windows fixes,  including  "-j"  (parallel
           builds) for Cygwin and MinGW and smart recursive builds on Cygwin.

       •   Also  install  abbreviations  consisting of 'mpp' plus the first letter of every following word, e.g.
           'mppc' for makeppclean.

       •   New `:build_check only_action' for commands that don't depend on the contents of their  dependencies,
           like symlink creation, where it is used automatically.

       •   Removed "--norc-substitution" and "--percent-subdirs" and "$(rc_substitution)" and "percent_subdirs".
           They are now to be given anywhere from target specific assignment to command line or environment vars
           "makepp_simple_concatenation" and "makepp_percent_subdirs".

       •   New action syntax "&amp;perl_function 'arg 1' arg2 ..." and "&amp;external-perl-script 'arg 1' arg2 ..."  New
           Perl function "run".

           There  are  the  following  builtin  commands: &amp;chmod, &amp;cp, &amp;cut, &amp;echo, &amp;expr, &amp;grep, &amp;install, &amp;ln,
           &amp;mkdir, &amp;mv, &amp;perl, &amp;preprocess, &amp;printf, &amp;rm, &amp;sed, &amp;sort, &amp;template, &amp;touch, &amp;uninstall, &amp;uniq  and
           &amp;yes,  which  can replace Unix commands of the same name, and more or less also the following: "awk",
           "chgrp", "chown", "head", "m4", "rmdir", "tail" and "tr".  They are also available  stand-alone  from
           the Shell.  They can also be used as functions, e.g. "$(&amp;cat file)", or as statements, or standalone.

           Note  that,  unlike earlier CVS versions, "&amp;cut -f", "&amp;grep -v" and "&amp;sort -r" now behave as in Unix.
           Note that in earlier CVS versions of &amp;template "@@" was processed  before  "@",  but  now  lines  are
           consistently handled front to back.

       •   Added  a  "global"  statement  for  sharing  variables  across  makefiles.  The assignment variant of
           "export" now works like a normal assignment, so you may have to change to ":=".  Added the "override"
           modifier to assignments.  The "define var :=" statement now optionally allows specifying the kind  of
           assignment.   And  the  forms  with  immediate  evaluation  retain  the newlines in "$(shell ...)" or
           "$(&amp;command)".  There are new assignment operators "&amp;=" for prepending, and ";=" which is a "="  when
           set, but automatically turns into a ":=" when first used.

       •   A makefile is now also found if it is called "Makeppfile.mk".

       •   There   are   two   new   possible   filenames   for   makefiles:  "RootMakeppfile"  or  equivalently
           "RootMakeppfile.mk".  The presence of either of these gives your build tree a formal root, accessible
           through the new variable "$(ROOT)".  The advantage is that this  file  is  always  loaded  first,  if
           present,  allowing you to more easily create a build system where makepp can be called from anywhere,
           without telling it which makefile to start at.

           The root of the file system is then automatically marked for "--dont-build", so that  makepp  doesn't
           go  messing  into  other directories you include or use libs from, just because they happen to have a
           Makefile or sources.

           Usually this means that the root of your build system gets marked for "--do-build".  If, however, you
           say "--do-build" for something under your build system root, which  doesn't  inherit  "--dont-build",
           then instead your build system root gets marked for "--dont-build".

       •   Removed  command "makeppclient" since we never managed to let builds start significantly faster.  The
           option "--stop-after-loading" is more beneficial.

       •   Interface definition files for SWIG (.i files) are now scanned for includes.  Makepp now  understands
           swig  invocations.   (SWIG  stands  for Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator.  It automatically
           generates all the wrapper functions to link your C or C++ code to a variety of other  languages  such
           as Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby, OCaml, C#, etc.  See <a href="http://www.swig.org/">http://www.swig.org/</a>.)

       •   GNU Emacs 22 now has a standard makefile-makepp-mode, which is the default when visiting <u>Makeppfile</u>.

       •   $[VARIABLE] or $[function ...] is evaluated when reading a makefile line, so the variable may contain
           makepp syntax.

       •   $(  ...)  is  now  always  a  list in rc-style substitution, so that "-I$( $(DIRLIST))" will leave no
           lonely option when DIRLIST is empty.

       •   You   can   now   double-paren   functions   and   multi-line    lists,    allowing    things    like
           "$((perl if( $a &lt; 5 ) { ... }))".

       •   New  "c_compilation_md5"  signature,  which  also  allows  adding whitespace where there was none and
           inversely.  It also ignores whitespace and comments  after  the  last  token.   This  is  useful  for
           preventing a useless rebuild if your VC adds lines at a "$""Log$" tag when checking in.

       •   Implement $? exactly as GNU make does.  New long name "$(changed_inputs)" for it.

       •   Implement "$(error ...)" and "$(warning ...)" as in GNU make.

       •   New method ": build_check ignore_action" to ignore changes to the action string.

       •   New statements "ifperl", "ifmakeperl", "iftrue", "ifntrue", "ifsys" and "ifnsys".

       •   Conditionals  "ifxxx"  may  now  be grouped with "and" and "or".  When written on the same line after
           "else", they create a branch of the same statement, rather than requiring nesting.

       •   Added support for dependencies on environment variables, using the ":env" rule option.

       •   Various signal handling fixes.

       •   New command "makeppclean" that efficiently removes generated files without loading makefiles.

       •   Ported to MinGW.

       •   New build caches, to cache files that are identical.  This means  that  if  you  change  a  file  and
           revert,  then  you can have makepp drop back to the immediately preceding .o file without rebuilding.
           Or you can share builds of identical files between separate source trees.  Newly  added  grouping  of
           build caches for big setups, possibly spanning several machines.

       •   At least Perl 5.6 is required.

   <b>Version</b> <b>1.40</b> <b>(December</b> <b>2004)</b>
       Thanks to Anders Johnson and Daniel Pfeiffer for major contributions of code to this release.

       •   Too  many  bug  fixes  to  list  individually.   Probably  the most salient fixes are to make it work
           significantly more reliably on Cygwin, but there were also fixes  to  variable  expansion,  scanning,
           repositories, etc.

       •   Rewritten  command parser and file scanner architecture so that it is more easily extensible.  Makepp
           now supports Verilog (a language used for chip design) in addition to C++ and Fortran.  It should  be
           relatively straightforward to support additional languages.  <u>(Anders</u> <u>Johnson)</u>

       •   New command "makeppclient" that lets builds start faster.  <u>(Daniel</u> <u>Pfeiffer)</u>

       •   If  you  have  Perl 5.6.0 or higher, HTML documentation now comes with the new working camel logo and
           syntax highlighting in the examples.  <u>(Daniel</u> <u>Pfeiffer)</u>

       •   Numerous corrections and improvements to the documentation.  <u>(Mostly</u> <u>Anders</u> <u>Johnson)</u>

       •   Support for GNU make's "define" statement to define multi-line variable values.

       •   $(PWD) and $(CURDIR) now work as in GNU make.

       •   New "--keep-repository-links" option to prevent makepp from deleting all the soft  links  it  creates
           when making repositories.

       •   New "--assume-old", "--assume-new", and "--dont-build" options, and support for the "-n" option.

       •   Support  for  double  colon  rules has slightly improved, so that we can handle makefiles produced by
           MakeMaker without much trouble.

       •   Added syntax for performing Perl code as a statement and in rules "perl { ...  }" or "makeperl {  ...
           }".   Added  functions  for  evaluating  Perl statements "$(perl ... )" or "$(makeperl ... )".  Added
           statement "makesub { ... }".  <u>(Daniel</u> <u>Pfeiffer)</u>

       •   Short options can now be directly followed  by  argument  as  in  -j4.   Documented  options  --jobs,
           --keep-going,  --makefile,  --what-if,  --assume-new,  --new-file,  --assume-old &amp; --old-file are now
           really accepted.  <u>(Daniel</u> <u>Pfeiffer)</u>

   <b>Version</b> <b>1.19</b> <b>(July</b> <b>2003)</b>
       Special thanks to Matthew Lovell and Chris van Engelen for lots of suggestions and tracking down problems
       in the code.

       •   Documentation was reorganized so that man pages as  well  as  HTML  pages  can  be  produced,  and  a
           cookbook/FAQ was added (see makepp_cookbook).

       •   A  "configure"  script  was  added so installation is more like other software products from the user
           point of view.

       •   The "$(origin )" function from GNU make is now supported.

       •   Target-specific variables are now supported as in GNU make, except that they do not  propagate  their
           values to dependencies.

       •   New  functions  "$(find_upwards )"  and  "$(relative_filename )"  (contributed by Matthew Lovell) and
           "$(relative_to )".

       •   In compilation commands, "-I dir" and "-L dir" are now supported  and  work  just  like  "-Idir"  and
           "-Ldir".

       •   Recompilation  of  C  files  will  now  occur  if  a  multi-line comment was inserted, or if the line
           numbering changed in any way.  Previously it ignored newlines in computing the checksum, which  meant
           that a change that affected debugger info might not force a recompilation.

       •   A bug in "$(shell )" which caused it to return a null string occasionally (especially when the system
           was heavily loaded) was fixed.

       •   Unreadable  files  or  directories  suppress  importing  from  repositories  but  are  not matched by
           wildcards.

       •   A few other minor bugs were fixed.

   <b>Version</b> <b>1.18</b> <b>(January</b> <b>2002)</b>
       The most important change was support for the Cygwin build environment.  You can now run makepp with  the
       Cygwin version of Perl; I do not think it will work properly with the native Windows version of Perl yet.

       A few other bug fixes went into this release.

   <b>Version</b> <b>1.10</b> <b>(February</b> <b>2001)</b>
       The  most  important change in this version is that makepp can accept a vastly larger number of makefiles
       without any command line options because of some changes to the implementation of recursive make.   There
       are a few minor improvements in the GNU make compatibility, and a slight improvement in memory usage.

       There are several user visible changes:

       •   "c_compilation_md5"  is  now  the default signature method.  This means that by default, makepp won't
           recompile C/C++ modules if only whitespace or comments have changed.

       •   A new signature method "md5" has been added, which runs an MD5 checksum on the file's contents.  This
           is not enabled by default; makepp still uses its original method ("exact_match") for any files  other
           than C/C++ source files.

       Because of these changes, makepp will recompile everything the first time you run it.

   <b>Version</b> <b>1.05</b>
       In  addition  to  bug-fixes, this version has one user-visible change.  The "--norc-substitution" command
       line option was introduced to allow compatible handling of whitespace in makefiles.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.99</b> <b>(January</b> <b>2001)</b>
       In addition to numerous bug fixes, this version has several user-visible changes:

       •   Multiple targets for a rule are now treated in a way which is more  compatible  with  old  makefiles.
           Makepp  has  a  heuristic algorithm for guessing whether the rule is supposed to build all targets at
           once or whether the rule needs to be invoked multiple times.  I do not  think  this  will  break  any
           existing  makefiles,  but  it  should allow makepp to work with many more makefiles designed for Unix
           make.

       •   The "--traditional-recursive-make" option can be  used  for  legacy  makefiles  which  use  recursive
           invocations of make in a way that didn't work with makepp's default implementation.

       •   Repositories now work with libtool.

       •   Variable settings are now allowed with the "load_makefile" statement and with recursive make.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.95</b>
       This version has several user-visible changes:

       •   A tutorial on writing makefiles for makepp has been added.

       •   GNU make style conditionals (ifeq/ifneq/ifdef/ifndef) are now supported, as is the "$(if )" function.

       •   By  default,  the  "%" wildcard now matches only files within a directory; "%.c" is now equivalent to
           "*.c", not "**/*.c".  The reason for this change was that rules almost never need  to  use  the  more
           complicated  wildcard,  and  it often caused unnecessary directories to be searched.  You can get the
           old behavior by specifying "--percent-subdirs" on the command line.  (I'm  curious  how  people  feel
           about this change.  Please let me know if you have good reasons for it being one way or the other.)

       •   By  default,  makefiles  from  any  directory  that  contains  a dependency, or that is searched by a
           wildcard, are loaded automatically.  Usually this means you don't need any "load_makefile" statements
           at all.  If this causes you problems, you can turn  off  implicit  loading  of  makefiles  by  adding
           "--no-implicit-load"  to  the  command  line.   (I'm  curious whether people like or dislike implicit
           loading of makefiles.)

       •   A target may now be declared phony on the same  line  that  defines  the  target  by  using  the  new
           "$(phony )" function, like this:

               $(phony all): program_1 program_2

           The  "$(phony )"  function  simply  returns  its arguments, but marks them as phony targets.  You can
           still use the older syntax that looks like this:

               all: program_1 program_2

               .PHONY: all

           The "$(phony )" function is an attempt to improve the readability of makefiles.   I'd  welcome  other
           suggestions, as I'm still not entirely happy with the syntax.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.90</b>
       In  order  to  support  features  like  parallel  make,  most  of  the internals had to be reorganized or
       rewritten.  The result is much cleaner and hopefully more reliable.

       Bugs too numerous to mention have been fixed.  In order to help ensure reliability, a test suite has been
       developed.  It doesn't test absolutely everything yet, but it does test most things, and I hope  to  make
       it  more  extensive  in  the  future.   You can run it by typing "makepp test" in the makepp distribution
       directory.  If an unmodified makepp fails the test suite, please let me know so I can fix it.

       There are many new features:

       •   Repositories are now supported.

       •   It is now possible to specify different methods for calculating and comparing file  signatures.   For
           example, you can use an MD5 checksum ignoring comments and whitespace, or you can require merely that
           the target be newer than the dependencies (the method that the traditional make uses).

       •   Makefiles are only rebuilt if they are older than their dependencies; a different signature method is
           used in this special case.

       •   Parallel  builds  are  now  supported,  though  this  is still an experimental feature.  See the "-j"
           option.

       •   It is now possible to write your own functions.  See the "sub"  statement  and  makepp_extending  for
           details.

       •   Filenames with characters like colon or space are now supported with a new quoting syntax.

       •   Synonymous,  less  cryptic  names  for  automatic  variables  have  been introduced to encourage more
           readable makefiles.

       •   Makepp now remembers the architecture of the machine you built on, and rebuilds if  the  architecture
           is different.

       •   Directories  can  now  be targets or dependencies; a previous restriction that all directories had to
           exist before the start of the build has been lifted.

       •   Makepp now writes a log file called ".makepp_log" explaining why  it  rebuilt  everything.   This  is
           extremely useful for debugging.

       •   The usual "-k" option for continuing to build even when an error occurs is now supported.

       •   The documentation has been reorganized and extended.

       There are also (unfortunately) a few incompatibilities with previous versions:

       •   The file format for storing information about the last build has changed.  Thus makepp will insist on
           rebuilding everything the first time you run the new version.

       •   load_makefile  no  longer  supports  targets or variable settings.  It now supports loading a list of
           makefiles rather than just one, so the "-F" switch is now unnecessary (and no longer documented).

       •   Recursive make now ignores variable settings  on  the  command  line.   This  is  necessary  to  load
           makefiles in a consistent way.

       •   "$(INFERRED_OBJS)"  is  no longer supported (since it was not a well-designed interface anyway).  Use
           the newer "$(infer_objects)" function instead.

       •   $_ is no longer supported.  Use "$(foreach)" instead.

       •   A few seldom used GNU make options such as "-s", "-n", and  "-q"  are  no  longer  supported  due  to
           internal architecture changes.  "-n" will probably be supported again in future releases.

       •   A man page is no longer provided since the documentation is no longer written in the Perl pod format.
           Use the HTML documentation instead.

       •   The automatic clean target is no longer supported.  A better way to do it is with "$(only_targets)".
