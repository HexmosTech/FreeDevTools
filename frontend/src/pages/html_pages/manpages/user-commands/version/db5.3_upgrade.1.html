</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       db5.3_upgrade - Upgrade the Berkeley DB version to the current release version.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>db5.3_upgrade</b> [-NsVv] [-h home] [-P password] file ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  db5.3_upgrade  utility  upgrades the Berkeley DB version of one or more files and the databases they
       contain to the current release version.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the current  working  directory
              is used.

       <b>-N</b>     Do  not  acquire  shared  region mutexes while running.  Other problems, such as potentially fatal
              errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as well.   This  option  is  intended  only  for  debugging
              errors, and should not be used under any other circumstances.

       <b>-P</b>     Specify  an  environment  password.   Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password strings as
              soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of vulnerability on  systems  where  unprivileged
              users  can  see  command-line  arguments  or  where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
              containing the command-line arguments.

       <b>-s</b>     This flag is only meaningful when upgrading databases from releases before  the  Berkeley  DB  3.1
              release.

              As  part of the upgrade from the Berkeley DB 3.0 release to the 3.1 release, the on-disk format of
              duplicate data items changed. To correctly upgrade the format requires that  applications  specify
              whether  duplicate data items in the database are sorted or not. Specifying the <b>-s</b> flag means that
              the duplicates are sorted; otherwise, they are assumed to be unsorted.  Incorrectly specifying the
              value of this flag may lead to database corruption.

              Because the db5.3_upgrade utility upgrades  a  physical  file  (including  all  the  databases  it
              contains), it is not possible to use db5.3_upgrade to upgrade files where some of the databases it
              includes  have  sorted  duplicate  data items, and some of the databases it includes have unsorted
              duplicate data items. If the file does not have more than a single database, if the  databases  do
              not  support  duplicate  data  items,  or  if  all the databases that support duplicate data items
              support the same style  of  duplicates  (either  sorted  or  unsorted),  db5.3_upgrade  will  work
              correctly  as  long  as the <b>-s</b> flag is correctly specified. Otherwise, the file cannot be upgraded
              using db5.3_upgrade, and must be upgraded manually using the db5.3_dump and db5.0_load utilities.

       <b>-V</b>     Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

       <b>-v</b>     Run in verbose mode, displaying a message for each successful upgrade.

       <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>Berkeley</b> <b>DB</b> <b>database</b> <b>upgrades</b> <b>are</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b>  <b>are</b>  <b>potentially</b>
       <b>destructive.</b>  This  means  that  if  the  system  crashes during the upgrade procedure, or if the upgrade
       procedure runs out of disk space, the databases may be left in an inconsistent and unrecoverable state.

       The db5.3_upgrade utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the <b>-h</b> option, the
       environment variable <b>DB_HOME</b>, or because the utility was run in a  directory  containing  a  Berkeley  DB
       environment).   In  order  to  avoid  environment  corruption  when  using  a  Berkeley  DB  environment,
       db5.3_upgrade should always be given the chance to detach from the environment and exit  gracefully.   To
       cause  db5.3_upgrade  to  release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal
       (SIGINT).

       The db5.3_upgrade utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DB_HOME</b>
              If the <b>-h</b> option is not specified and the environment variable DB_HOME is set, it is used  as  the
              path of the database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.
