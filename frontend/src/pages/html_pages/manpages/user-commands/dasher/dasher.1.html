</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dasher - graphical predictive text entry system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dasher</b> [<b>OPTIONS</b>] [<b>filename</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Dasher</b>  is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by natural continuous pointing gestures.
       Dasher is a competitive text-entry system wherever a full-size keyboard cannot be used.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dasher</b> takes the following options:

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--appstyle</b>=<u>STYLE</u>
              Application style.  <u>STYLE</u> can be any of <b>traditional</b>, <b>direct</b>, <b>compose</b>, or <b>fullscreen</b>.  The  default
              is  whatever  was  specified  on  the previous invocation of Dasher, or <b>traditional</b> when Dasher is
              started for the first time.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Describe command line options.

       <b>--help-options</b>
              Describe the options available with <b>--options.</b>

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--options</b> [<b>option</b>=<b>value</b>[,<b>option</b>=<b>value</b>...]]
              Override stored options.  Options values are remembered for subsequent invocations of Dasher.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The main Dasher interface is a window with a blank background containing a column of letters on the right
       hand side.  Click the mouse button to start.  When the pointer is to  the  right  of  the  crosshair  the
       screen  will  zoom  towards  the  point underneath the mouse pointer.  To select a letter, move the mouse
       pointer into it and watch how it zooms underneath the crosshair.  A new column of  letters  will  appear.
       Staying  within  the box for the selected letter, move the pointer over one of these letters to select it
       as the next letter.  Moving the mouse pointer to the left of the crosshair, or outside  of  the  box  for
       previously selected letters, allows you to change previously selected letters.

</pre><h4><b>Application</b> <b>Styles</b></h4><pre>
       <b>traditional</b>
              Dasher  displays  an  <u>edit</u>  <u>box</u> above the main window.  Text entered via Dasher will appear in the
              edit box allowing the text to be edited directly.

       <b>direct</b> The edit box is not displayed.  Dasher runs without focus and the text goes into  whatever  window
              does have focus.  This way you can use it more practically to run your desktop.

       <b>fullscreen</b>
              dasher expands to the entire screen.

</pre><h4><b>MENUS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>File</b>

       Import training text
              Use  a file to further improve Dasher's prediction of the next letters to present (for instance, a
              training file containing scientific terms to add to the initial English training).  Training files
              must be UTF-8 encoded.

       Quit   Exit Dasher.

              Display information about the current version of Dasher

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>PREFERENCES</b> <b>DIALOG</b></h4><pre>
       The preferences dialog is split into several panes.

   <b>Alphabet</b>
       Choose a different alphabet. Dasher will automatically retrain itself if the alphabet specified  training
       file is present.

   <b>Colour</b>
       Choose a different colour scheme.

   <b>Control</b>
       Alter various control options

       One dimensional mode
              Map  the  Y  position  of  the  mouse to a 2 dimensional position on the Dasher canvas (useful for
              limited mobility users)

       Eyetracker mode
              Similar to one dimensional mode, but behaves normally except at the right-hand side of the canvas.
              Designed for eyetracker users.

</pre><h4><b>CONVERTING</b> <b>TRAINING</b> <b>FILES</b> <b>TO</b> <b>UTF-8</b></h4><pre>
       Dasher requires that training files be in the UTF-8 format, whereas most text files are likely to  be  in
       ISO-8859  format. This doesn't matter for plain text, but accented characters are encoded differently. In
       order to convert them, use the <b><a href="../man1/iconv.1.html">iconv</a></b>(1) program. For instance, if your training  file  is  in  ISO-8859-1
       format (Western European), run <b>iconv</b> <b>-f</b> <b>ISO-8859-1</b> <b>-t</b> <b>UTF-8</b> <b>trainingfile</b> <b>&gt;newtrainingfile</b>

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/usr/share/doc/dasher</b>
              Directory containing system-wide configuration files.

       <b><a href="file:~/.dasher">~/.dasher</a></b>
              Directory containing user specific configuration files.

       <b>Dasher</b> will utilise files of the following form from both of these directories:

       alphabet.<u>ALPHABET</u>.xml
              The files defining the alphabets available to Dasher.

       colour.<u>SCHEME</u>.xml
              The files defining the colour schemes available to Dasher.

       training_<u>LANGUAGE*</u>.txt
              Files  containing  the  training  data  used  by  Dasher.  These are UTF-8 encoded text and should
              contain a representative sample of the relevant language.  User specific  training  files  can  be
              used to augment system wide data.

       Refer to the Dasher manual for more information regarding the format and editing of these files.
