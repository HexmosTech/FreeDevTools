</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       crystal-facet-uml - creates a set of uml diagrams. crystal-facet-uml ensures consistency of relationships
       and uml element names between different diagrams. crystal-facet-uml exports diagrams in various vector
       and pixel-based image formats.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>crystal-facet-uml</b> [<b>-u</b> <u>database_file</u> ]

       <b>crystal-facet-uml</b> {<b>-t</b> | <b>-r</b>} <u>database_file</u>

       <b>crystal-facet-uml</b> {<b>-h</b> | <b>-v</b>}

       <b>crystal-facet-uml</b> -e <u>database_file</u> <u>export_format</u> <u>export_directory</u>

       <b>crystal-facet-uml</b> -i <u>database_file</u> <u>import_mode</u> <u>json_input_file</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       crystal-facet-uml provides a graphical user interface to

       •   create, modify and delete diagrams,

       •   create, modify and delete UML/SysML elements,

       •   create, modify and delete relationships,

       •   cut, copy, paste elements between diagrams,

       •   undo and redo are supported,

       •   multiple windows can show different or same parts of the uml model,

       •   search for elements.

       Diagrams are layouted part-automatically:

       •   The user chooses the relative location of elements towards others,

       •   crystal-facet-uml selects the exact locations of shown elements.

       •   The user controls the positions of messages/transitions in sequence and timing diagrams,

       •   crystal-facet-uml auto-layouts relationships in other diagrams.

       crystal-facet-uml manages a meta model:

       •   Diagrams are organized as a tree, similar to a book's table-of-contents;

       •   Uml(TM)/SysML(TM) elements exist only once even if shown in many diagrams;

       •   Relationships and features are consistent between all diagrams;

       •   Diagram-local messages/transitions are supported in scenario-based interaction diagrams: sequence,
           communication, timing, interaction overview.

       •   These extension mechanisms of UML are supported: Tagged values and stereotypes including stereotype
           images.

       Diagrams can be exported as

       •   images: pdf, ps, svg, png,

       •   text: utf-8, DocBook, html,

       •   machine-readable model: json, xmi(TM).

       crystal-facet-uml can also be started from command line

       •   to export all diagrams automatically or

       •   to import a previously exported json file or

       •   to check and repair database files.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Without options, the program starts in graphical mode. See crystal-facet-uml_documentation.pdf for
       graphical mode usage.

       <b>-u</b> <u>database_file</u>
           Starts in graphical mode and opens the database_file immediately.

           If the file does not exist, a new, empty database is created. If database_file ends on .cfu1, a
           binary database file is created. Otherwise, a json data file is created.

       <b>-t</b> <u>database_file</u>
           Tests the consistency of a database_file. In case of an error, a non-zero value is returned.

       <b>-r</b> <u>database_file</u>
           Tests the consistency of a database_file and repairs found issues.

       <b>-h</b>
           Show summary of options.

       <b>-v</b>
           Show version

       <b>-e</b> <u>database_file</u> <u>export_format</u> <u>export_directory</u>
           Exports all diagrams of a database_file in export_format to the export_directory. Valid formats are:
           docbook, html, json, pdf, png, ps, svg, txt, xmi. Please be aware that the export overwrites possibly
           existing files in the export_directory without notice.

       <b>-i</b> <u>database_file</u> <u>import_mode</u> <u>json_input_file</u>
           Imports elements from json_input_file to the database_file. Valid modes are: check, add. Please
           create a backup of your database_file before importing.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       To store a database in a version control system (vcs) like svn or git, store the json file format <b>*.cfuJ</b>
       to your vcs.

       •   Note that this feature requires at least version 1.35.0, better version 1.39.0 to work smoothly.

       •   Do not synchronize the file with your vcs while you modify it at the same time; save your changes
           first and re-open the json file afterwards.

       •   In case of merge conflicts in <b>*.cfuJ</b> files, note that uuid strings do uniquely identify all json
           objects. Relations between objects are defined by these uuid strings. In contrast to uuids,
           integer-id can be changed as long as they are unique among all objects of same type within the file.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The following diagnostics may be issued on syslog:

       EVT : ...
           An event occurred (DEBUG mode only).

       ANOM: ...
           Something unexpected happened that was handled (DEBUG mode only).

       WARN: ...
           Something unexpected happened that may cause a failure.

       ERR : ...
           Something unexpected happened that has caused a failure.

       <b>journalctl</b> <b>-f</b> allows one to read the syslog.
