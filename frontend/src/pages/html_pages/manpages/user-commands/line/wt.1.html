</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wtWiredTiger command line utility
        - WiredTiger includes a command line utility, wt.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       wt [-LRVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] command [command-specific arguments]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The wt tool is a command-line utility that provides access to various pieces of the WiredTiger
       functionality.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are several global options:

       <b>-C</b> <b>config</b>
           Specify configuration strings for the <b>wiredtiger_open</b> function.

       <b>-E</b> <b>secretkey</b>
           Specify an encryption secret key for the <b>wiredtiger_open</b> function.

       <b>-h</b> <b>directory</b>
           Specify a database home directory.

       <b>-L</b>
           Forcibly turn off logging subsystem for debugging purposes.

       <b>-R</b>
           Run recovery if the underlying database is configured to do so.

       <b>-V</b>
           Display WiredTiger version and exit.

       <b>-v</b>
           Set verbose output.

       Unless otherwise described by a wt command, the wt tool exits zero on success and non-zero on error.

       The wt tool supports several commands. If configured in the underlying database, some commands will run
       recovery when opening the database. If the user wants to force recovery on any command, use the -R
       option. In general, commands that modify the database or tables will run recovery by default and commands
       that only read data will not run recovery.

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>alter</b></h4><pre>
       Alter a table.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] alter uri configuration ...

       The uri and configuration pairs may be specified to the alter command. These configuration pairs can be
       used to modify the configuration values from those passed to the <b>WT_SESSION::create</b> call.

       The uri part of the configuration pair should match only one of the objects being altered, but may be a
       prefix of the object being matched. For example, the following two sets of configuration pairs are
       equivalent in the case of altering a single table named xxx.

       table access_pattern_hint=sequential
       table:xxx access_pattern_hint=sequential

       It's an error, however, to specify a matching prefix that matches more than a single object being
       altered.

       Multiple configuration arguments may be specified. For example, the following two sets of configuration
       pairs are equivalent:

       table:xxx access_pattern_hint=random,cache_resident=false
       table:xxx access_pattern_hint=random table:xxx cache_resident=false

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>backup</b></h4><pre>
       Perform a backup of a database or set of data sources.

       The backup command performs a backup of the database, copying the underlying files to a specified
       directory, which can be subsequently opened as a WiredTiger database. See <b>Backups</b> for more information,
       and <b>File</b> <b>permissions</b> for specifics on the copied file permissions.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] backup [-t uri] directory

   <b>Options</b>
       The following are command-specific options for the backup command:

       <b>-t</b> <b>uri</b>
           By default, the backup command does a backup of the entire database; the -t option changes the backup
           command to do a backup of only the named data sources.

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>compact</b></h4><pre>
       Compact a table.

       The compact command attempts to rewrite the specified table to consume less disk space.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] compact uri

   <b>Options</b>
       The compact command has no command-specific options.

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>create</b></h4><pre>
       Create a table.

       The create command creates the specified uri with the specified configuration. It is equivalent to a call
       to <b>WT_SESSION::create</b> with the specified string arguments.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] create [-c config] uri

   <b>Options</b>
       The following are command-specific options for the create command:

       <b>-c</b>
           Include a configuration string to be passed to <b>WT_SESSION::create</b>.

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>drop</b></h4><pre>
       Drop a table.

       The drop command drops the specified uri. It is equivalent to a call to <b>WT_SESSION::drop</b> with the 'force'
       configuration argument.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] drop uri

   <b>Options</b>
       The drop command has no command-specific options.

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>dump</b></h4><pre>
       Export data in a text format.

       The dump command outputs the specified table in a portable format which can be re-loaded into a new table
       using the load command.

       See <b>Dump</b> <b>Formats</b> for details of the dump file formats.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] dump [-jrx] [-c checkpoint] [-f output] uri

   <b>Options</b>
       The following are command-specific options for the dump command:

       <b>-c</b>
           By default, the dump command opens the most recent version of the data source; the -c option changes
           the dump command to open the named checkpoint.

       <b>-f</b>
           By default, the dump command output is written to the standard output; the -f option re-directs the
           output to the specified file.

       <b>-j</b>
           Dump in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.

       <b>-r</b>
           Dump in reverse order, from largest key to smallest.

       <b>-x</b>
           Dump all characters in a hexadecimal encoding (the default is to leave printable characters
           unencoded).

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>list</b></h4><pre>
       List the tables in the database.

       By default, the list command prints out the tables stored in the database. If a URI is specified as an
       argument, only information about that data source is printed.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] list [-cv] [uri]

   <b>Options</b>
       The following are command-specific options for the list command:

       <b>-c</b>
           If the -c option is specified, the data source's checkpoints are printed in a human-readable format.

       <b>-v</b>
           If the -v option is specified, the data source's complete schema table value is printed.

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>load</b></h4><pre>
       Load a table from dump output.

       The load command reads the standard input for data and loads it into a table, creating the table if it
       does not yet exist. The data should be the format produced by the dump command; see <b>Dump</b> <b>Formats</b> for
       details.

       By default, if the table already exists, data in the table will be overwritten by the new data (use the
       -n option to make an attempt to overwrite existing data return an error).

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] load [-ajn] [-f input] [-r name] [uri configuration
       ...]

   <b>Options</b>
       The following are command-specific options for the load command:

       <b>-a</b>
           If the -a option is specified, record number keys in the input are ignored and the data is appended
           to the data source and assigned new record number keys. The -a option is only applicable when loading
           into a column store.

       <b>-f</b>
           By default, the load command reads from the standard input; the -f option reads the input from the
           specified file.

       <b>-j</b>
           Load input in the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format that was created by the dump -j command.

       <b>-n</b>
           By default, input data will overwrite existing data where the key/value pair already exists in the
           data source; the -n option causes the load command to fail if there's an attempt to overwrite already
           existing data.

       <b>-r</b>
           By default, the load command uses the table name taken from the input; the -r option renames the data
           source.

       Additionally, uri and configuration pairs may be specified to the load command. These configuration pairs
       can be used to modify the configuration values from the dump header passed to the <b>WT_SESSION::create</b>
       call.

       The uri part of the configuration pair should match only one of the objects being loaded, but may be a
       prefix of the object being matched. For example, the following two sets of configuration pairs are
       equivalent in the case of loading a single table named xxx.

       table block_allocation=first
       table:xxx block_allocation=first

       It's an error, however, to specify a matching prefix that matches more than a single object being loaded.

       Multiple configuration arguments may be specified. For example, the following two sets of configuration
       pairs are equivalent:

       table:xxx block_allocation=first,prefix_compress=false
       table:xxx block_allocation=first table:xxx prefix_compress=false

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>loadtext</b></h4><pre>
       Load text into a table.

       The loadtext command reads the standard input for text and loads it into a table. The input data should
       be printable characters, with newline delimiters for each key or value.

       The loadtext command does not create the object if it does not yet exist.

       In the case of inserting values into a column-store table, each value is appended to the table; in the
       case of inserting values into a row-store table, lines are handled in pairs, where the first line is the
       key and the second line is the value. If the row-store table already exists, data in the table will be
       overwritten by the new data.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] loadtext [-f input] uri

   <b>Options</b>
       The following are command-specific options for the loadtext command:

       <b>-f</b>
           By default, the loadtext command reads from the standard input; the -f option reads the input from
           the specified file.

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>printlog</b></h4><pre>
       Display the database log.

       The printlog command outputs the database log.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] printlog [-x] [-f output]

   <b>Options</b>
       The following are command-specific options for the printlog command:

       <b>-f</b>
           By default, the printlog command output is written to the standard output; the -f option re-directs
           the output to the specified file.

       <b>-x</b>
           Keys and value items in the log are printed in hex format in addition to the default string format.

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>read</b></h4><pre>
       Read records from a table.

       The read command prints out the records associated with the specified keys from the specified data
       source. The data source must be configured with string or record number keys and string values.

       The read command exits non-zero if a specified record is not found.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] read uri key ...

   <b>Options</b>
       The read command has no command-specific options.

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>rename</b></h4><pre>
       Rename a table.

       The rename command renames the specified table.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] rename uri name

   <b>Options</b>
       The rename command has no command-specific options.

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>salvage</b></h4><pre>
       Recover data from a corrupted table.

       The salvage command salvages the specified data source, discarding any data that cannot be recovered.
       Underlying files are re-written in place, overwriting the original file contents.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] salvage [-F] uri

   <b>Options</b>
       The following are command-specific options for the salvage command:

       <b>-F</b>
           By default, salvage will refuse to salvage tables that fail basic tests (for example, tables that
           don't appear to be in a WiredTiger format). The -F option forces the salvage of the table,
           regardless.

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>stat</b></h4><pre>
       Display database or data source statistics.

       The stat command outputs run-time statistics for the WiredTiger engine, or, if specified, for the URI on
       the command-line.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] stat [-f] [uri]

   <b>Options</b>
       The following are command-specific options for the stat command:

       <b>-f</b>
           Include only 'fast' statistics in the output (equivalent to passing statistics=(fast)) to
           <b>WT_SESSION::open_cursor</b>.

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>truncate</b></h4><pre>
       Truncate a table, removing all data.

       The truncate command truncates the specified uri. It is equivalent to a call to <b>WT_SESSION::truncate</b> with
       no start or stop specified.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] truncate uri

   <b>Options</b>
       The truncate command has no command-specific options.

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>upgrade</b></h4><pre>
       Upgrade a table.

       The upgrade command upgrades the specified table, exiting success if the data source is up-to-date, and
       failure if the data source cannot be upgraded.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] upgrade uri

   <b>Options</b>
       The upgrade command has no command-specific options.

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>verify</b></h4><pre>
       Check the structural integrity of a table.

       The verify command verifies the specified table, exiting success if the data source is correct, and
       failure if the data source is corrupted.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] verify uri

   <b>Options</b>
       The verify command has no command-specific options.

</pre><h4><b>wt</b> <b>write</b></h4><pre>
       Write records to a table.

       The write command stores records into the specified data source. The data source must be configured with
       string or record number keys and string values.

       If the write command is called with the -a option, each command-line argument is a single value to be
       appended to the specified column-store data source. If the write command is not called with the -a
       option, the command-line arguments are key/value pairs.

       Attempting to overwrite an already existing record will fail.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
        wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] write -a uri value ...
        wt [-RVv] [-C config] [-E secretkey ] [-h directory] write [-o] uri key value ...

   <b>Options</b>
       The following are command-specific options for the write command:

       <b>-a</b>
           Append each value as a new record in the data source.

       <b>-o</b>
           By default, attempting to overwrite an already existing record will fail. The -o option changes write
           to overwrite previously existing records.
