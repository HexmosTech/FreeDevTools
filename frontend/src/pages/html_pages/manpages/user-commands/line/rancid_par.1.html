       rancid_par - parallel command processing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rancid_par</b> [<b>-FHdefiqx</b>] [<b>-c</b>  command] [<b>-l</b>  logfile] [<b>-n</b> #] [<b>-p</b> #] [file [file...]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rancid_par</b>  takes  a  list of files to run a command on.  The first line of each file begins with a colon
       (:) or a pound-sign (#).  If a colon, the remainder of the line is a command  to  run  for  each  of  the
       subsequent  lines.   If a pound-sign, then each subsequent line is a (self-contained) command, unless the
       <b>-c</b> option was specified, in which case the lines become the arguments replacing the braces ({}s)  in  the
       <b>-c</b> argument.

       The input file may also be specified on stdin, in the format as previously described.

       In  each  of  the  cases where the lines of the file, following the first, are not commands (ie: colon or
       -c), instances of open-close braces ({}) in the command will be replaced by these values.

       For example, an inputfile whose contents is:

            : echo {}
            a
            b
            c

       run with <b>rancid_par</b> like so:

            %rancid_par -q inputfile

       will produce the following output (order will vary):

            b
            a
            c

       The command-line options are as follows:

       <b>-F</b>     Omit the footer that normally follows the output of each job.

       <b>-H</b>     Omit the header that normally precedes the output of each job.

       <b>-c</b>     Command to be run on each of the arguments following the command-line  options,  where  the  first
              line of the input file(s) begins with a pound-sign (#).

       <b>-d</b>     Print  debugging  information on standard error (stderr).  Repeat the option up to three times for
              more verbosity.

       <b>-e</b>     Split args by spaces, rather than using sh -c.  Note: <b>-e</b> is incompatible with the <b>-i</b> option.

       <b>-f</b>     No input file or STDIN, just run a quantity of the command specified with -c.

       <b>-i</b>     Run commands interactively through (multiple) <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1) processes.

       <b>-l</b>     Prefix of logfile name, as in prefix.N where N is the <b>rancid_par</b> process number ([0..]).

              Default: par.log.&lt;time&gt;.[0..]

       <b>-n</b> <b>N</b>   Number of simultaneous processes.

              Default: 3

       <b>-p</b> <b>N</b>   Pause N seconds between running commands.

       <b>-q</b>     Quiet mode.  Omit the typical processing logs and do not create the log files from -l, instead the
              children inherit stdout and stderr from <b>rancid_par.</b>  <b>-q</b> is mutually exclusive with the <b>-x</b>  and  <b>-l</b>
              options and the option appearing last will take precedence.

       <b>-x</b>     View rancid_par logs in real-time via an <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>par.log.T.N</u> Log file; where T is the current time in seconds since the
       epoch and N is the rancid_par process number ([0..]).

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rancid_par</b> was ported from the perl version.  It differs in the following manner:

       A)     If <b>rancid_par</b> receives a HUP/INT/TERM/QUIT signal, it does not print the commands that will not be
              run.

       B)     If <b>rancid_par</b> received a HUP/INT/TERM/QUIT signal, it does not exit immediately after sending kill
              to  running  jobs.   it  waits for them to exit so that they are cleaned-up properly.  If a second
              signal is received, it dies immediately.

                                                  29 July 2019                                     <u><a href="../man1/rancid_par.1.html">rancid_par</a></u>(1)
