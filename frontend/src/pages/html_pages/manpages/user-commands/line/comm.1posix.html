</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       comm — select or reject lines common to two files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       comm <b>[</b>-123<b>]</b> <u>file1</u> <u>file2</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>comm</u>  utility shall read <u>file1</u> and <u>file2</u>, which should be ordered in the current collating sequence,
       and produce three text columns as output: lines only in <u>file1</u>, lines only in <u>file2</u>,  and  lines  in  both
       files.

       If the lines in both files are not ordered according to the collating sequence of the current locale, the
       results are unspecified.

       If the collating sequence of the current locale does not have a total ordering of all characters (see the
       Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>7.3.2</u>, <u>LC_COLLATE</u>) and any lines from the input files
       collate equally but are not identical, <u>comm</u> should treat them as different lines but may  treat  them  as
       being  the  same.  If  it  treats them as different, <u>comm</u> should expect them to be ordered according to a
       further byte-by-byte comparison using the collating sequence for the POSIX locale and  if  they  are  not
       ordered  in this way, the output of <u>comm</u> can identify such lines as being both unique to <u>file1</u> and unique
       to <u>file2</u> instead of being in both files.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>comm</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-1</b>        Suppress the output column of lines unique to <u>file1</u>.

       <b>-2</b>        Suppress the output column of lines unique to <u>file2</u>.

       <b>-3</b>        Suppress the output column of lines duplicated in <u>file1</u> and <u>file2</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>file1</u>     A pathname of the first file to be compared. If <u>file1</u> is <b>'-'</b>, the standard input shall be used.

       <u>file2</u>     A  pathname  of  the  second  file to be compared. If <u>file2</u> is <b>'-'</b>, the standard input shall be
                 used.

       If both <u>file1</u> and <u>file2</u> refer to standard input or to the same FIFO special, block special, or  character
       special file, the results are undefined.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The standard input shall be used only if one of the <u>file1</u> or <u>file2</u> operands refers to standard input. See
       the INPUT FILES section.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The input files shall be text files.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>comm</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_COLLATE</u>
                 Determine the locale for the collating sequence <u>comm</u> expects to have been used when  the  input
                 files were sorted.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>comm</u>  utility  shall produce output depending on the options selected. If the <b>-1</b>, <b>-2</b>, and <b>-3</b> options
       are all selected, <u>comm</u> shall write nothing to standard output.

       If the <b>-1</b> option is not selected, lines contained only in <u>file1</u> shall be written using the format:

           "%s\n", &lt;<u>line</u> <u>in</u> <u>file1</u>&gt;

       If the <b>-2</b> option is not selected, lines contained only in <u>file2</u> are written using the format:

           "%s%s\n", &lt;<u>lead</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>line</u> <u>in</u> <u>file2</u>&gt;

       where the string &lt;<u>lead</u>&gt; is as follows:

       &lt;tab&gt;     The <b>-1</b> option is not selected.

       null string
                 The <b>-1</b> option is selected.

       If the <b>-3</b> option is not selected, lines contained in both files shall be written using the format:

           "%s%s\n", &lt;<u>lead</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>line</u> <u>in</u> <u>both</u>&gt;

       where the string &lt;<u>lead</u>&gt; is as follows:

       &lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;
                 Neither the <b>-1</b> nor the <b>-2</b> option is selected.

       &lt;tab&gt;     Exactly one of the <b>-1</b> and <b>-2</b> options is selected.

       null string
                 Both the <b>-1</b> and <b>-2</b> options are selected.

       If the input files were ordered according to the collating sequence of  the  current  locale,  the  lines
       written  shall be in the collating sequence of the current locale. If the input files contained any lines
       that collated equally but were not identical and within each file those lines were ordered according to a
       further byte-by-byte comparison using the collating sequence for the POSIX locale, and <u>comm</u> treated  them
       as  different  lines,  then  lines  written  that collate equally but are not identical should be ordered
       according to a further byte-by-byte comparison using the collating sequence for the POSIX locale.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All input files were successfully output as specified.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       If the input files are not properly presorted, the output of <u>comm</u> might not be useful.

       When using <u>comm</u> to process pathnames, it is recommended that LC_ALL, or at least LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE,
       are set to POSIX or C in the environment, since pathnames can contain byte sequences  that  do  not  form
       valid  characters  in some locales, in which case the utility's behavior would be undefined. In the POSIX
       locale each byte is a valid single-byte character, and therefore this problem is avoided.

       If the collating sequence of the current locale does not have a total ordering of  all  characters,  this
       can affect the behavior of <u>comm</u> in the following ways:

        *  If  <u>comm</u>  treats  lines  as being the same only if they are identical, some lines can be misleadingly
           identified as being both unique to <u>file1</u> and unique to <u>file2</u>.

        *  If <u>comm</u> treats lines as being the same if they collate equally and a line from <u>file1</u> collates equally
           with a line from <u>file2</u> but is not identical to it, one of the lines  is  misleadingly  identified  as
           being in both files and the other is not written to the output at all.

       Such  problems  can  be  avoided  by  forcing  the  use  of  the POSIX locale; for example, the following
       identifies lines in both <u>file1</u> and <u>file2</u>:

           LC_ALL=POSIX sort file1 &gt; file1.posix
           LC_ALL=POSIX sort file2 &gt; file2.posix
           LC_ALL=POSIX comm -12 file1.posix file2.posix | sort

       The final <u>sort</u> re-sorts the output of <u>comm</u> according to the collating sequence of  the  original  locale.
       Doing this might be difficult if more than one column is output and leading &lt;blank&gt;s cannot be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       If  a file named <b>xcu</b> contains a sorted list of the utilities in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, a file named
       <b>xpg3</b> contains a sorted list of the utilities specified in the X/Open Portability Guide, Issue  3,  and  a
       file  named  <b>svid89</b>  contains  a  sorted list of the utilities in the System V Interface Definition Third
       Edition:

           comm -23 xcu xpg3 | comm -23 - svid89

       would print a list of utilities in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 not  specified  by  either  of  the  other
       documents:

           comm -12 xcu xpg3 | comm -12 - svid89

       would print a list of utilities specified by all three documents, and:

           comm -12 xpg3 svid89 | comm -23 - xcu

       would  print a list of utilities specified by both XPG3 and the SVID, but not specified in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A future version of this standard may require that if any lines from the input files collate equally  but
       are not identical, then <u>comm</u> treats them as different lines and expects them to be ordered according to a
       further byte-by-byte comparison using the collating sequence for the POSIX locale.

       A  future  version of this standard may require that if the input files contained any lines that collated
       equally but were not identical and within each file those lines were ordered according to a further byte-
       by-byte comparison using the collating sequence for the POSIX locale, then  lines  written  that  collate
       equally  but  are  not  identical  are  ordered  according to a further byte-by-byte comparison using the
       collating sequence for the POSIX locale.
