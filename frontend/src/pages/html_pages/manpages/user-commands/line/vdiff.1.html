       vdiff - display line-by-line differences between versions of files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vdiff</b> [ <u>diff-options</u> ] [ <b>-base</b> <u>path</u> ] [ <b>-P</b> ] files ..

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vdiff</b>  is  a  differential comparator for file versions that are stored in <u>shapeTools'</u> object base, <u>AtFS</u>.
       The functionality of <b>vdiff</b> is very similar to the <b>diff</b> command on your host.  All  options  and  switches
       that are recognized by <b>diff</b> can also be specified for <b>vdiff</b>.

       The  arguments  to  <b>vdiff</b>  can  either  be a single filename, or a pair of <u>version</u> <u>identifiers</u>. If only a
       filename is specified, <b>vdiff</b> prints the differences between  the  specified  file  and  the  most  recent
       version of this file that is stored in the AtFS object base. A file can be compared to any stored version
       by  specifying  the  version as first, and the filename as second argument. If both arguments are version
       identifiers, the difference between these two versions is printed.

       Differences between files and versions can be printed in any style that is supported by  the  local  <b>diff</b>
       program.

       Version  identifiers  consist of the filename, and a version number or alias name for a version, enclosed
       in brackets. Example:
                                     retrieve.c[4.22]    or    retrieve.c[Rel-4.1]

       <b>vdiff</b> creates temporary copies of the versions that shall be compared,  invokes  the  <b>diff</b>  command,  and
       finally removes the temporary copies.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-base</b> <u>path</u>
              If  <b>vdiff</b> is told to produce a <u>context</u> <u>diff</u>, the filenames of the compared objects are mangeled so
              that the specified <u>path</u> replaces the path of the current directory in the full pathnames appearing
              in the diff-header. This is useful to replace an absolute pathname  by  a  relative  pathname  and
              makes the produced context-diff easier to digest for the <b>patch</b> program.

       <b>-P</b>     With the <b>-P</b> switch turned on, <b>vdiff</b> won't give up if one of the two objects that shall be compared
              does  not exist. In this case an empty object is substituted for the missing one, causing the diff
              to be the complete contents of the existing object. This is  useful  in  situations  when  complex
              patches  are  produced  that  upgrade  one  release of a software system to a new release, and the
              system has structurally changed (i.e. new files have been added to the system).
