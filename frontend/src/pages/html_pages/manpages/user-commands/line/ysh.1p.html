       ysh - The YAML Test Shell

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        ysh [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is designed to let you play with the Perl YAML modules in an interactive way. When you to
       type in Perl, you get back YAML. And vice versa.

       By default, every line you type is a one line Perl program, the return value of which will be displayed
       as YAML.

       To enter multi-line Perl code start the first line with ';' and use as many lines as needed. Terminate
       with a line containing just ';'.

       To enter YAML text, start with a valid YAML separator/header line which is typically '---'. Use '===' to
       indicate that there is no YAML header. Enter as many lines as needed. Terminate with a line containing
       just '...'.

       To read in and process an external YAML file, enter '&lt; filename'. The ysh will also work as a standalone
       filter. It will read anything on STDIN as a YAML stream and write the Perl output to STDOUT. You can say
       (on most Unix systems):

           cat yaml.file | ysh | less

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -MYAML::Module
           Set the YAML implementation module you wish.

       -l  Keep  a  log  of all ysh activity in './ysh.log'. If the log file already exists, new content will be
           concatenated to it.

       -L  Keep a log of all ysh activity in './ysh.log'. If the log file already exists,  it  will  be  deleted
           first.

       -r  Test roundtripping. Every piece of Perl code entered will be Dumped, Loaded, and Dumped again. If the
           two stores do not match, an error message will be reported.

       -R  Same as above, except that a <b>confirmation</b> message will be printed when the roundtrip succeeds.

       -i&lt;number&gt;
           Specify the number of characters to indent each level. This is the same as setting $YAML::Indent.

       -ub Shortcut for setting '$YAML::UseBlock = 1'. Force multiline scalars to use 'block' style.

       -uf Shortcut for setting '$YAML::UseFold = 1'. Force multiline scalars to use 'folded' style.

       -uc Shortcut for setting '$YAML::UseCode = 1'. Allows subroutine references to be processed.

       -nh Shortcut for setting '$YAML::UseHeader = 0'.

       -nv Shortcut for setting '$YAML::UseVersion = 0'.

       -v  Print the versions of ysh and the YAML implementation module in use.

       -V  In addition to the -v info, print the versions of YAML related modules.

       -h  Print a help message.

   <b>YSH_OPT</b>
       If  you  don't want to enter your favorite options every time you enter ysh, you can put the options into
       the "YSH_OPT" environment variable.  Do something like this:

           export YSH_OPT='-i3 -uc -L'
