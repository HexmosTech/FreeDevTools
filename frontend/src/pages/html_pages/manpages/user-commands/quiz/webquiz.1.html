       WebQuiz: a LaTeX package for writing online quizzes -

       <u>WebQuiz</u>  makes  it  possible  to  use  <u>LaTeX</u>  to write interactive online quizzes.  The quizzes are first
       written in <u>LaTeX</u> and then converted into HTML using <u>WebQuiz</u>, which is written in python.  The  conversion
       from <u>LaTeX</u> to HTML is done behind the scenes using <u>TeX4ht</u>. The idea is that you should be able to produce
       nice online quizzes using <u>WebQuiz</u> and basic knowledge of <u>LaTeX</u>.

       <u>WebQuiz</u>  is  designed  to be used from the command-line.  For example, if <u>quiz1.tex</u> is a LaTeX file for a
       quiz then:

       <u>latex</u> <u>quiz1</u>
              produces a "readable" DVI file for the quiz

       <u>pdflatex</u> <u>quiz1</u>
              produces a "readable" PDF file for the quiz

       <u>webquiz</u> <u>quiz1</u>
              creates the web page <u>quiz1.html</u>

       If you prefer to use <u>LaTeX</u> from a GUI for <u>LaTeX</u> then it should be possible to configure it to use <u>WebQuiz</u>
       directly. As an example, the manual provides some details about how to do this for TeXShop.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       To use <u>WebQuiz</u> you need to have a standard <u>LaTeX</u> distribution installed, such as <u>TeXLive</u>,  that  includes
       <u>TeX4ht</u>.  In  addition, you need to have <u>Python3</u> installed. As <u>WebQuiz</u> uses scalable vector graphics (SVG)
       you should check that all of the dependencies of <u>dvisvgm</u> are installed on your system, especially if  you
       plan on using graphics or images.

       Once  the  TeX  components  of  <u>WebQuiz</u> package have been installed you can install the web components of
       <u>WebQuiz</u> using the following command, which needs to be run  from the command line:

       &gt; webquiz --initialise

       If you want to install the web components of <u>WebQuiz</u> into a system directory then you need  to  run  this
       command  from  an administrators account, so using <u>sudo</u> on a unix-like system. For more details about the
       installation and configuration of <u>WebQuiz</u> please see Section 3.2 of the <u>WebQuiz</u> manual.

       Please see the manual for more details about initialising and using <u>WebQuiz</u>.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>THE</b> <b>CTAN</b> <b>ZIPFILE</b></h4><pre>
       On both unix-like systems (including macosx), and windows systems (using either TeXLive or  MiKTeX),  you
       can install WebQuiz by downloading the WebQuiz zip file from:
          <u><a href="http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/webquiz.zip">http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/webquiz.zip</a></u>

       To install the package, unzip this file and change directory to the webquiz/scripts subdirectory run:

       &gt; webquiz --tex-install

       (or  webquiz.bat  --text-install on windows). This commands unpacks the webquiz files into their standard
       locations in the TeX install tree to it should be run from an administrators account, or using sudo on  a
       unix-like system.  Roughly what this command does is the following:

       • It creates a symbolic link, or equivalent, to the main WebQuiz executable, which is the file webquiz.py
         in the scripts directory

       • Copies the latex directory to somewhere in the TeX search path and then runs <u>mktexlsr</u> so that LaTeX and
         WebQuiz can find these files.

       • Copies the python code into the TeX scripts subdirectory

       • Copies the WebQuiz doc subdirectory into the TeX doc/latex subdirectory.

       If  you  are  using MiKTeX you may need to open the MiKTeX console, go to the Tasks menu and then rebuild
       the TeX filename database.

       Once the files above are in place initialise WebQuiz by following the installation instructions above.

       Mainly for development purposes, there is another undocumented command-line  option  for  removing  these
       files from TEXMFMAIN:

       &gt; sudo webquiz/scripts/webquiz --tex-uninstall

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       In order to work WebQuiz needs the following programs to be installed on your system:

       • An  up-to-date  <u>LaTeX</u>  distribution,  such as that provided by <u>TeXLive</u>. In particular, you need to have
         <u>TeX4ht</u> and <u>make4ht</u> installed.  Unfortunately, since  TeXLive  2018  was  released  there  have  been  a
         significat  bunber  of updates to a number of packahges that <u>WebQuiz</u> uses, including updates to <u>TeX4ht</u>,
         <u>make4ht</u>, <u>tikz</u> and <u>pstricks</u>. For this reason, <u>it</u> <u>is</u> <u>strongly</u> <u>recommended</u>  <u>that</u>  <u>you</u>  <u>all</u>  <u>packages</u>  <u>from</u>
         <u>ctan</u><b>_</b> <u>before</u> <u>using</u> <u>WebQuiz</u><b>_</b>.

       • <u>python3</u> As of writing python 3.7.2 is available.

       • <u>Javascript</u>

       • If you plan to use <u>pstricks</u> with <u>WebQuiz</u>, or if you want to compile the online manual for WebQuiz, then
         you  need  to ensure that <u>ghostscript</u> and <u>dvisvgm</u> are installed and properly configured on your system.
         See the <u>WebQuiz</u> manual and the <u>dvisvgm</u> documentation for more details

       • A web server. To view online quizzes you of course need a web server. As described in the  <b>Installation</b>
         section you will also need to copy of the <u>WebQuiz</u> components onto your web server using the command:

         &gt; webquiz --initialise

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The  LaTeX  component of <u>WebQuiz</u> was written by Andrew Mathas and the python, css and javascript code was
       written by Andrew Mathas (and Don Taylor), based on an initial protype of Don Taylor's from  2001.  Since
       2004  the  program  has  been maintained and developed by Andrew Mathas. Although the program has changed
       substantially since 2004 Don's idea of using <u>TeX4ht</u>, and some of his code, is still very much in use.
