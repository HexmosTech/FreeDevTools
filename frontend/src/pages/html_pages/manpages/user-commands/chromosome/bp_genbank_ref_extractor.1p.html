</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bp_genbank_ref_extractor - Retrieves all related sequences for a list of searches on Entrez gene

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.77

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bp_genbank_ref_extractor</b> [options] [Entrez Gene Queries]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This script searches on <u>Entrez</u> <u>Gene</u> database and retrieves not only the gene sequence but also the
       related transcript and protein sequences.

       The gene UIDs of multiple searches are collected before attempting to retrieve them so each gene will
       only be analyzed once even if appearing as result on more than one search.

       Note that <u>by</u> <u>default</u> <u>no</u> <u>sequences</u> <u>are</u> <u>saved</u> (see options and examples).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Several options can be used to fine tune the script behaviour. It is possible to obtain extra base pairs
       upstream and downstream of the gene, control the naming of files and genome assembly to use.

       See the section bugs for problems when using default values of options.

       <b>--assembly</b>
           When  retrieving  the sequence, a specific assemly can be defined. The value expected is a regex that
           will be case-insensitive. If it matches more than one assembly, it  will  use  the  first  match.  It
           defaults to "(primary|reference) assembly".

       <b>--debug</b>
           If  set,  even  more  output  will  be  printed  that may help on debugging. Unlike the messages from
           <b>--verbose</b> and <b>--very-verbose</b>, these will not appear on the log file unless this option  is  selected.
           This option also sets <b>--very-verbose</b>.

       <b>--downstream</b>, <b>--down</b>
           Specifies  the  number  of  extra base pairs to be retrieved downstream of the gene.  This extra base
           pairs will only affect the gene sequence, not the transcript or proteins.

       <b>--email</b>
           A valid email used to connect to the NCBI servers. This may be used by NCBI to contact users in  case
           of problems and before blocking access in case of heavy usage.

       B &lt;--api-key&gt;
           NCBI  requires  an  API key for requests over 10/sec as of December 2018. You may generate one in the
           "My NCBI" area.

       <b>--format</b>
           Specifies the format that the sequences will be saved. Defaults to <u>genbank</u> format.  Valid formats are
           'genbank' or 'fasta'.

       <b>--genes</b>
           Specifies the name for gene file. By default, they are not saved. If no value is  given  defaults  to
           its UID. Possible values are 'uid', 'name', 'symbol' (the official symbol or nomenclature).

       <b>--help</b>
           Display the documentation (this text).

       <b>--limit</b>
           When  making a query, limit the result to these first specific results. This is to prevent the use of
           specially unspecific queries and a warning will be given if a query returns  more  results  than  the
           limit. The default value is 200. Note that this limit is for <u>each</u> search.

       <b>--non-coding</b>, <b>--nonon-coding</b>
           Some protein coding genes have transcripts that are non-coding. By default, these sequences are saved
           as well. <b>--nonon-coding</b> can be used to ignore those transcripts.

       <b>--proteins</b>
           Specifies  the  name for proteins file. By default, they are not saved. If no value is given defaults
           to its accession. Possible values are 'accession', 'description', 'gene' (the corresponding gene  ID)
           and 'transcript' (the corresponding transcript accesion).

           Note  that  if  not using 'accession' is possible for files to be overwritten. It is possible for the
           same gene to encode more than one protein or different proteins to have the same description.

       <b>--pseudo</b>, <b>--nopseudo</b>
           By default, sequences of pseudo genes will be saved. <b>--nopseudo</b> can be used to ignore those genes.

       <b>--save</b>
           Specifies the path for the directory where the sequence and log files will be saved. If the directory
           does not exist it will be created although the path to it must exist. Files on the directory  may  be
           rewritten  if  necessary.  If  unspecified,  a  directory  named  <u>extracted</u>  <u>sequences</u> on the current
           directory will be used.

       <b>--save-data</b>
           This options saves the data (gene UIDs, description, product  accessions,  etc)  to  a  file.  As  an
           optional value, the file format can be specified. Defaults to CSV.

           Currently only CSV is supported.

           Saving the data structure as a CSV file, requires the installation of the Text::CSV module.

       <b>--transcripts</b>, <b>--mrna</b>
           Specifies  the  name  for  transcripts  file.  By  default,  they are not saved. If no value is given
           defaults to its accession. Possible values are 'accession', 'description', 'gene' (the  corresponding
           gene ID) and 'protein' (the protein the transcript encodes).

           Note  that  if  not using 'accession' is possible for files to be overwritten. It is possible for the
           same gene to have more than one transcript or different transcripts to  have  the  same  description.
           Also, non-coding transcripts will create problems if using 'protein'.

       <b>--upstream</b>, <b>--up</b>
           Specifies the number of extra base pairs to be extracted upstream of the gene.  This extra base pairs
           will only affect the gene sequence, not the transcript or proteins.

       <b>--verbose</b>, <b>--v</b>
           If set, program becomes verbose. For an extremely verbose program, use <b>--very-verbose</b> instead.

       <b>--very-verbose</b>, <b>--vv</b>
           If set, program becomes extremely verbose. Setting this option, automatically sets <b>--verbose</b> as well.
           For help in debugging, consider using <b>--debug</b>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        bp_genbank_ref_extractor \
          --transcripts=accession \
          '"homo sapiens"[organism] AND H2B'

       Search Entrez Gene with the query '"homo sapiens"[organism] AND H2B' and save their transcripts sequences
       only.  Note that default value of <b>--limit</b> may only extract some of the hits.

        bp_genbank_ref_extractor \
          --transcripts=accession --proteins=accession \
           --format=fasta \
           '"homo sapiens"[organism] AND H2B' \
           '"homo sapiens"[organism] AND MCPH1'

       Save   both   transcript   and   protein   sequences  in  the  fasta  format,  for  two  queries,  '"homo
       sapiens"[organism] AND H2B' and '"homo sapiens"[organism] AND MCPH1'.

        bp_genbank_ref_extractor \
          --genes --down=500 --up=100 \
          '"homo sapiens"[organism] AND H2B'

       Download genomic sequences, including 500 bp downstream and 100 bp upstream of each gene.

        bp_genbank_ref_extractor \
          --genes --asembly='Alternate HuRef' \
          '"homo sapiens"[organism] AND H2B'

       Download genomic sequences from the Alternate HuRef genome assembly.

        bp_genbank_ref_extractor --save-data=CSV \
          '"homo sapiens"[organism] AND H2B'

       Do not save any sequence, only save the results in a CSV file.

        bp_genbank_ref_extractor --save='search-results' \
          --genes=name  downstream=500 --upstream=200 \
          --nopseudo --nonnon-coding --transcripts --proteins \
          --format=fasta --save-data=CSV \
          '"homo sapiens"[organism] AND H2B' \
          '"homo sapiens"[organism] AND MCPH1'

       Ignoring non-coding and pseudo genes, downloads: genomic sequences with 500 and  200  bp  downstream  and
       upstream  respectively,  using  the  gene name as filename; transcript and proteins sequences using their
       accession number as filename; everything in fasta format plus a CSV file with search results; saved in  a
       directory named <u>search-results</u>

</pre><h4><b>NON-BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       •   When  supplying options, it's possible to not supply a value and use their default. However, when the
           expected value is a string, the next argument may be confused as value for the option.  For  example,
           when using the following command:

            bp_genbank_ref_extractor --transcripts \
              'H2A AND homo sapiens'

           we  mean  to  search  for 'H2A AND homo sapiens' saving only the transcripts and using the default as
           base for the filename. However, the search terms will be interpreted as the base  for  the  filenames
           (but  since  it's  not  a valid identifier, it will return an error). To prevent this, you can either
           specify the values:

            bp_genbank_ref_extractor --transcripts='accession' \
              'H2A AND homo sapiens'

           or you can use the double hash to stop processing options. Note that this should only be  used  after
           the last option. All arguments supplied after the double dash will be interpreted as search terms

            bp_genbank_ref_extractor --transcripts \
              -- 'H2A AND homo sapiens'

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       •   Genes  that  are  marked as 'live' and 'protein-coding' should have at least one transcript. However,
           This is not always true due to mistakes on annotation. Such cases will throw a  warning.  When  faced
           with     this,     be     nice     and     write     to     the     entrez     RefSeq     maintainers
           &lt;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/update.cgi">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/update.cgi</a>&gt;.

       •   When creating the directories to save the files, if the directory already exists it will be used  and
           no error or warning will be issued unless <b>--debug</b> as been set. If a non-directory file already exists
           with that name bp_genbank_ref_extractor exits with an error.

       •   On  the  subject  of  verbosity,  all  messages  are saved on the log file. The options <b>--verbose</b> and
           <b>--very-verbose</b> only affect their printing to standard output. Debug messages are  different  as  they
           will only show up (and be logged) if requested with <b>--debug</b>.

       •   When  saving  a  file,  to  avoid  problems  with  limited filesystems such as NTFS or FAT, only some
           characters are allowed. All other characters will be replaced by an  underscore.  Allowed  characters
           are:

           <b>a-z</b> <b>0-9</b> <b>-</b> <b>+</b>  <b>.</b> <b>,</b> <b>()</b> <b>{}</b> <b>[]'</b>

       •   <b>bp_genbank_ref_extractor</b>  tries to use the same file extensions that bioperl would expect when saving
           the file. If unable it will use the '.seq' extension.
