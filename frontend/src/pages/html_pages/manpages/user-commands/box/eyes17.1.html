</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       eyes17 - an interactive board to control the expeyes-17 box

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>eyes17</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>eyes17</b> is a program to control interactively most features of the expeyes-17 box.

       Eyes17 is from the PHOENIX project of Inter-University Accelerator Centre, New Delhi. It is a hardware &amp;
       software framework for developing science experiments, demonstrations and projects and learn science and
       engineering by exploration. Capable of doing real time measurements and analysing the data in different
       ways. Analog voltages are measured with 0.025% resolution and time intervals with one microsecond. This
       project is based on Free and Open Source software, mostly written in Python programming language. The
       hardware design is also open. When compared with previous ExpEYES boxes (Expeyes, Expeyes-Junior),
       ExpEYES-17 is richer in various features: multiple soft input ranges, more flexible wave generator,
       better time resolution, better voltage resolution, supports seamlessly cheap I2C sensors.
