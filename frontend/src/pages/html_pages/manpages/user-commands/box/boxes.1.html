</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       boxes - text mode box and comment drawing filter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>boxes</b> [options] [infile [outfile]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Boxes</u>  is  a  text  filter which can draw any kind of box around its input text. Box design choices range
       from simple boxes to complex ASCII art. A box can also be removed and repaired, even if it has been badly
       damaged by editing of the text inside. Since boxes may be open on any side, <u>boxes</u> can  also  be  used  to
       create  regional  comments  in  any  programming  language.   New  box designs can be added and shared by
       appending to a configuration file.

       <u>boxes</u> is a command line tool, but also integrates with any text editor that supports filters.  The  <u>boxes</u>
       website has examples on how to configure editor integration for various text editors:
       &lt;URL:https://boxes.thomasjensen.com/editors.html&gt;

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options offered by <u>boxes</u> are the following:

       <b>-a</b> <u>format</u>, <b>--align</b>=<u>format</u>
             Alignment/positioning  of text inside box. This option takes a format string argument which is read
             from left to right. The format string may not contain whitespace and must consist of one or more of
             the following components:

             <u>h</u>x - horizontal alignment of the input text block inside a box. Possible values for <u>x</u> are  <u>l</u>  (ell,
             for left alignment), <u>c</u> (center), or <u>r</u> (right). This does not affect the justification of text lines
             within the input text block (use the <u>j</u> argument instead).
             <u>v</u>x  - vertical alignment of the input text block inside a box. Possible values for <u>x</u> are <u>t</u> (for top
             alignment), <u>c</u> (center), or <u>b</u> (bottom).
             <u>j</u>x - justification of lines within the input text block. Possible values for <u>x</u> are <u>l</u> (ell, for left
             justification), <u>c</u> (center), or <u>r</u> (right). This does not affect the  alignment  of  the  input  text
             block itself within the box. Use the <u>h</u> and <u>v</u> arguments for input text block positioning.

             Short hand notations (can be combined with the above arguments):
             <u>l</u> (ell) - short for <u>h</u>l<u>v</u>c<u>j</u>l
             <u>c</u> - short for <u>h</u>c<u>v</u>c<u>j</u>c
             <u>r</u> - short for <u>h</u>r<u>v</u>c<u>j</u>r

             The default for <b>-a</b> is <u>h</u>l<u>v</u>t.

       <b>-c</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--create</b>=<u>string</u>
             Command  line design definition for simple cases. The argument of this option is the definition for
             the "west" (W) shape. The defined shape must consist of exactly one line, i.e. no multi-line shapes
             are allowed. The <b>-c</b> option is intended as a shortcut for those cases where simple regional comments
             are to be created, which only need a certain character or sequence of characters to  be  placed  in
             front  of  every  line. In such cases, it is much more convenient to simply specify <b>-c</b> than to do a
             complete design definition in one's config file, where the only shape defined is the west shape.
             This option implies a <b>-d</b> and does not access the  config  file.   <b>-c</b>  may  of  course  be  used  in
             conjunction with any of the other options. By default, <b>-c</b> is not specified.

       <b>--color</b>, <b>--no-color</b>
             Printing  of  color  codes.  Box  designs  and  the text inside a box may contain ANSI color codes,
             sometimes called "escape sequences". In this way, boxes and text can be colored.
             Whether these escape sequences are  printed  by  <u>boxes</u>  is  normally  determined  by  the  terminal
             capabilities  (default). Using <b>--color</b>, <u>boxes</u> can be told to always output escape sequences even if
             it thinks the terminal may not understand them. Using <b>--no-color</b>, escape sequences  will  never  be
             printed.

             Of  course, even with <b>--color</b>, a box will only appear colored if it is already defined with colors.
             In case you want to auto-color some text that isn't yet, take a look at <u>lolcat</u>.
             These options consider all escape sequences to be color codes. Any other escape  sequences  present
             will be printed or removed along with the color codes.

       <b>-d</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--design</b>=<u>string</u>
             Design  selection.  The  one  argument  of  this option is the name of the design to use, which may
             either be a design's primary name or any of its alias names.

       <b>-e</b> <u>eol</u>, <b>--eol</b>=<u>eol</u>
             Override line terminator.  <u>eol</u> can be <u>CR</u>, <u>LF</u>, or <u>CRLF</u>.  The default is to use  the  system-specific
             line  terminator, which means <u>CRLF</u> on Windows, and <u>LF</u> otherwise. This option should only be used in
             an emergency, because normally the system-specific line terminator will be just fine.  This  option
             is  considered  experimental,  and  may  go  away  in  a  future  version of <u>boxes</u>.  Let us know in
             &lt;URL:https://github.com/ascii-boxes/boxes/issues/60&gt; if you think we should keep it.

       <b>-f</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--config</b>=<u>string</u>
             Use alternate config file. The one argument of this option is the name  of  a  valid  <u>boxes</u>  config
             file.  The  argument  of  <b>-f</b>  can  also  be  a  directory which contains a configuration file. More
             information on this topic below in the CONFIGURATION FILE section.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
             Print usage information.

       <b>-i</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--indent</b>=<u>string</u>
             Indentation mode. Possible arguments are <u>text</u> (indent text inside of box),  <u>box</u>  (indent  box,  not
             text inside of box), or <u>none</u> (throw away indentation). Arguments may be abbreviated. The default is
             <u>box</u>.

       <b>-k</b> <u>bool</u>, <b>--kill-blank</b>, <b>--no-kill-blank</b>
             Kill  leading/trailing  blank  lines  on  removal. The value of <u>bool</u> is either <u>true</u> or <u>false</u>.  This
             option only takes effect in connection with <b>-r</b>.  If set to <u>true</u>, leading and trailing  blank  lines
             will be removed from the output. If set to <u>false</u>, the entire content of the former box is returned.
             The  default is <u>false</u>, if both the top and the bottom part of the box are open, as is the case with
             most regional comments. If the box's design defines a top part or a bottom  part,  the  default  is
             <u>true</u>.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
             List  designs.  Produces  a  listing  of all available box designs in the config file, along with a
             sample box and information about its creator.  Also checks the syntax of the entire config file. If
             used in conjunction with <b>-d</b>, displays detailed information about the specified design.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mend</b>
             Mend box. This removes a (potentially broken) box as with <b>-r</b>, and redraws it afterwards. The mended
             box is drawn according to the options given. This may  be  important  to  know  when  it  comes  to
             restoring padding, indentation, etc. for the mended box. Implies <b>-k</b> <u>false</u>.

       <b>-n</b> <u>encoding</u>, <b>--encoding</b>=<u>encoding</u>
             Character  encoding. Overrides the character encoding of the input and output text. Choose from the
             list shown by <u>iconv</u> <u>-l</u>. If an invalid character encoding is specified here,  <u>UTF-8</u>  is  used  as  a
             fallback.  The  default is to use the system encoding, which is normally the best course of action.
             So don't specify this option unless you have to.

       <b>-p</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--padding</b>=<u>string</u>
             Padding. Specify padding in spaces around the input text block  for  all  sides  of  the  box.  The
             argument  string  may  not  contain  whitespace  and must consist of a combination of the following
             characters, each followed by a number indicating the padding in spaces:

             <u>a</u> - (all) give padding for all sides at once
             <u>h</u> - (horiz) give padding for both horizontal sides
             <u>v</u> - (vertical) give padding for both vertical sides
             <u>b</u> - (bottom) give padding for bottom (south) side
             <u>l</u> - (left) give padding for left (west) side
             <u>t</u> - (top) give padding for top (north) side
             <u>r</u> - (right) give padding for right (east) side

             Example: <b>-p</b> <u>a</u>4<u>t</u>2 would define the padding to be 4 characters on all sides, except for  the  top  of
             the box, where the input text block will be only 2 lines away from the box.
             The  default  for  this option is determined by the box design used. If the design does not specify
             anything, no default padding is used.

       <b>-q</b> <u>query</u>, <b>--tag-query</b>=<u>query</u>
             Query designs by tag. In contrast to <b>-l</b>, this will only  print  the  matching  design  names.  This
             option  is  normally  used  stand-alone;  if  used  in  combination with other options, behavior is
             undefined.  The <u>query</u> argument is a comma-separated list of tags which can be present on  a  design
             in  order to match. A tag may optionally be prefixed with <u>+</u> in order to require that it be present,
             or with <u>-</u> in order to exclude designs which have that tag. Each tag can only occur once per  query.
             The special query <u>(all)</u> matches all box designs, even if they don't have any tags.
             This  option  is  intended  for  use by scripts. Alias names are printed below their primary design
             name, and postfixed with <u>(alias)</u>.
             Example: <u>boxes</u> <u>-q</u> <u>programming,-comment</u>

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--remove</b>
             Remove an existing box. Which design to use is detected automatically. In order to save time or  in
             case the detection does not decide correctly, combine with <b>-d</b> to specify the design.

       <b>-s</b> <u>width</u><b>x</b><u>height</u>, <b>--size</b>=<u>width</u><b>x</b><u>height</u>
             Box size. This option specifies the desired box size in units of columns (for width) and lines (for
             height).   If  only  a  single  number  is given as argument, this number specifies the desired box
             width. A single number prefixed by 'x' specifies only the box height.   The  actual  resulting  box
             size  may  vary  depending  on the individual shape sizes of the chosen design. Also, other command
             line options may influence the box size (such as <b>-p</b>).
             By default, the smallest possible box is created around the text.

       <b>-t</b> <u>tabopts</u>, <b>--tabs</b>=<u>tabopts</u>
             Tab handling. This option controls how tab characters in the input text are  handled.  The  <u>tabopts</u>
             must  always  begin  with  a  positive  integer  number  indicating the distance between tab stops,
             sometimes called "spaces per tab".
             Immediately following the tab distance, an optional character can be appended, telling <u>boxes</u> how to
             treat the leading tabs. The following options are available:

             <b>e</b> - expand tabs into spaces
             <b>k</b> - keep tabs as close to what they were as possible
             <b>u</b> - unexpand tabs. This makes <u>boxes</u> turn as many spaces as possible into tabs.

             The <b>-t</b> <u>string</u> can be just a number. In that case, <b>e</b>  is  assumed  for  tab  handling.  The  factory
             default for the <b>-t</b> option is simply 8, which is just such a case.
             For  example,  you  could  specify  <b>-t</b> 4u in order to have your leading tabs unexpanded. In the box
             content, tabs are always converted into spaces. The tab distance in this example is 4.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
             Print out current version number.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Boxes</u> will look for the configuration file in several  places,  some  of  which  are  given  by  the  XDG
       specification.

       <b>1.</b> <u>-f</u> option [file or dir]
             When  a  configuration  file  is specified on the command line, we will use that. The <b>-f</b> option can
             also specify a directory. Any location specified via <b>-f</b> must exist, or <u>boxes</u> will terminate with an
             error.

       <b>2.</b> <u>BOXES</u> environment variable [file or dir]
             If no config file is specified on the command line, <u>boxes</u> will  check  for  the  BOXES  environment
             variable,  which  may  contain a filename or directory to use. Any location specified via the BOXES
             environment variable must exist, or <u>boxes</u> will terminate with an error.

       <b>3.</b> <u>$HOME</u> [dir]
       <b>4.</b> <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/boxes</u> [dir]
       <b>5.</b> <u>$HOME/.config/boxes</u> [dir]
       <b>6.</b> <u>/etc/boxes/boxes-config</u> [file]
       <b>7.</b> <u>/etc/xdg/boxes</u> [dir]
       <b>8.</b> <u>/usr/local/share/boxes</u> [dir]
       <b>9.</b> <u>/usr/share/boxes</u> [dir]
             Either one of these last two directory locations might have the same name as the global config file
             from <b>6</b>. That's fine. It just means that we first look for a file of  that  name,  and  then  for  a
             directory containing the file.

       The  XDG  environment  variable <u>XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</u> is not supported. However, its default value is supported
       via steps <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> above.

       In the above list, whenever a step is designated with [dir], the following file names will be found, in
       this order:
             <b>1.</b> .boxes
             <b>2.</b> box-designs
             <b>3.</b> boxes-config
             <b>4.</b> boxes

       As soon as the first valid file is found, we use that and stop the search.

       The   recommended   location   for   a   user-specific   configuration   file    is    <u>$HOME/.boxes</u>    or
       <u>$HOME/.config/boxes/.boxes</u>. A global configuration file should be located at <u>/etc/boxes/boxes-config</u>. But
       all of the other locations are fully supported, too.

       The     syntax     of     <u>boxes</u>     config     files     is     described     on     the    website    at
       &lt;URL:https://boxes.thomasjensen.com/config-syntax.html&gt;.
