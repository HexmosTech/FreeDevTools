</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mmv - move/copy/link multiple files by wildcard patterns

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mmv</b> [<u>-m|-x|-r|-c|-o|-a|-l|-s</u>] [<u>-h</u>] [<u>-d|-p</u>] [<u>-g|-t</u>] [<u>-v|-n</u>] <u>FROM</u> <u>TO</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       move/copy/link multiple files by wildcard patterns

       The FROM pattern is a shell glob pattern, in which `*' stands for any number of characters and `?' stands
       for a single character.

       Use   #[l|u]N  in  the  TO  pattern  to  get  the  string  matched  by  the  Nth  FROM  pattern  wildcard
       [lowercased|uppercased].

       Patterns should be quoted on the command line.

       <u>Mmv</u> moves (or copies or links, as specified) each source file matching a <u>from</u> pattern to the target  name
       specified  by  the  <u>to</u>  pattern.   This  multiple action is performed safely, i.e. without any unexpected
       deletion of files due to collisions of target names with existing filenames or with other  target  names.
       Furthermore,  before  doing anything, <u>mmv</u> attempts to detect any errors that would result from the entire
       set of actions specified and gives the user the choice of either proceeding  by  avoiding  the  offending
       parts  or  aborting.   <u>mmv</u>  does  support large files (LFS) but it does <u>not</u> support sparse files (i.e. it
       explodes them).

       Older versions of <u>mmv</u> supported interactive editing of the rename etc. operations, but  using  a  fragile
       system  that could not cope with certain characters, such as spaces, in filenames. Users who require this
       functionality can use <u><a href="../man1/qmv.1.html">qmv</a></u>(1) and friends (in the <u>renameutils</u> package).

                                                   The Task Options

       Whether <u>mmv</u> moves, copies, or links is governed by the first set of options  given  above.   If  none  of
       these are specified, the task is given by the command name under which <u>mmv</u> was invoked:

               command name   default task

               mmv            --copydel
               mcp            --copy
               mln            --hardlink

       The task option choices are:

       <b>--move</b>:
              move  source  file  to  target  name.   Both  must be on the same device.  If the source file is a
              symbolic link, moves the link without checking if the link's target  from  the  new  directory  is
              different than the old.

       <b>--copydel</b>:
              same  as  --move,  except  cross-device  moves  are  done  by copying, then deleting source.  When
              copying, sets the permission bits and file modification time of the target file  to  that  of  the
              source file.

       <b>--rename</b>:
              rename source file or directory to target name.  The target name must not include a path: the file
              remains in the same directory in all cases.

       <b>--copy</b>:
              copy  source  file  to  target  name.   Sets the file modification time and permission bits of the
              target file to that of the source file, regardless of whether  the  target  file  already  exists.
              Chains and cycles (to be explained below) are not allowed.

       <b>--overwrite</b>:
              overwrite  target  name  with  source file.  If target file exists, it is overwritten, keeping its
              original owner and permission bits.  If  it  does  not  exist,  it  is  created,  with  read-write
              permission  bits set according to <u><a href="../man1/umask.1.html">umask</a></u>(1), and the execute permission bits copied from the source
              file.  In either case, the file modification time is set to the current time.

       <b>--hardlink</b>:
              link target name to source file.  Both must be on the same device, and the source must  not  be  a
              directory.  Chains and cycles are not allowed.

       <b>--symlink</b>:
              same  as  --hardlink, but use symbolic links instead of hard links.  For the resulting link to aim
              back at the source, either the source name must begin with a '/', or the  target  must  reside  in
              either  the  current  or  the  source directory.  If none of these conditions are met, the link is
              refused.  However, source and target can reside on different devices, and  the  source  can  be  a
              directory.

       Only one of these options may be given, and it applies to all matching files.

                                                   The <u>From</u> Pattern

       The  <u>from</u>  pattern  is a filename with embedded wildcards: '*', '?', '['...']', and ';'.  The first three
       have their usual <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1) meanings of, respectively, matching any string of characters, matching any  single
       character, and matching any one of a set of characters.

       Between  the  '[' and ']', a range from character 'a' through character 'z' is specified with "a-z".  The
       set of matching characters can be negated by inserting a '^' after  the  '['.   Thus,  "[^b-e2-5_]"  will
       match any character but 'b' through 'e', '2' through '5', and '_'.

       Note  that paths are allowed in the patterns, and wildcards may be intermingled with slashes arbitrarily.
       The ';' wildcard is useful for matching files at any depth in the directory tree.  It matches the same as
       "*/" repeated any number of times, including zero, and can only occur either  at  the  beginning  of  the
       pattern  or  following  a  '/'.  Thus ";*.c" will match all ".c" files in or below the current directory,
       while "/;*.c" will match them anywhere on the file system.

       In addition, if the <u>from</u> pattern (or the <u>to</u> pattern) begins with "~/", the '~' is replaced with the  home
       directory  name.   (Note that the "~user" feature of <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) is not implemented.)  However, the '~' is not
       treated as a wildcard, in the sense that it is not assigned a wildcard index (see below).

       The directories "." and ".." are only  matched  against  completely  explicit  <u>from</u>  patterns  (i.e.  not
       containing wildcards).

       Files  beginning  with  '.'  are  only  matched  against  <u>from</u>  patterns that begin with an explicit '.'.
       However, if -h is specified, they are matched normally.

       Warning: since the shell normally expands wildcards before passing the command-line arguments to <u>mmv</u>,  it
       is usually necessary to enclose the command-line <u>from</u> and <u>to</u> patterns in quotes.

                                                    The <u>To</u> Pattern

       The <u>to</u> pattern is a filename with embedded <u>wildcard</u> <u>indexes</u>, where an index consists of the character '#'
       followed by a string of digits.  When a source file matches a <u>from</u> pattern, a target name for the file is
       constructed out of the <u>to</u> pattern by replacing the wildcard indexes by the actual characters that matched
       the referenced wildcards in the source name.  Thus, if the <u>from</u> pattern is "abc*.*" and the <u>to</u> pattern is
       "xyz#2.#1",  then  "abc.txt" is targeted to "xyztxt.".  (The first '*' matched "", and the second matched
       "txt".)  Similarly, for the pattern pair ";*.[clp]"  -&gt;  "#1#3/#2",  "foo1/foo2/prog.c"  is  targeted  to
       "foo1/foo2/c/prog".   Note  that  there  is no '/' following the "#1" in the <u>to</u> pattern, since the string
       matched by any ';' is always either empty or ends in a '/'.  In this case, it matches "foo1/foo2/".

       To convert the string matched by a wildcard to either lowercase or uppercase before embedding it  in  the
       target name, insert 'l' or 'u', respectively, between the '#' and the string of digits.

       The  <u>to</u>  pattern,  like  the  <u>from</u> pattern, can begin with a "~/" (see above).  This does not necessitate
       enclosing the <u>to</u> pattern in quotes on the command line since <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) expands the '~'  in  the  exact  same
       manner as <u>mmv</u> (or, in the case of <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1), does not expand it at all).

       For  all task options other than -r, if the target name is a directory, the real target name is formed by
       appending a '/' followed by the last component of the source file name.  For example, "mmv  dir1/a  dir2"
       will,  if "dir2" is indeed a directory, actually move "dir1/a" to "dir2/a".  However, if "dir2/a" already
       exists and is itself a directory, this is considered an error.

       To strip any character (e.g. '*', '?', or '#') of  its  special  meaning  to  <u>mmv</u>,  as  when  the  actual
       replacement  name  must  contain the character '#', precede the special character with a '\' (and enclose
       the argument in quotes because of the shell).  This also works to terminate a wildcard index when it  has
       to be followed by a digit in the filename, e.g. "a#1\1".

                                                   Chains and Cycles

       A  chain is a sequence of specified actions where the target name of one action refers to the source file
       of another action.  For example,

       mmv
       a b
       b c

       specifies the chain "a" -&gt; "b" -&gt; "c".  A cycle is a chain where the last target name refers back to  the
       first  source file, e.g. "mmv a a".  <u>Mmv</u> detects chains and cycles regardless of the order in which their
       constituent actions are actually given.  Where allowed, i.e. in moving and  renaming  files,  chains  and
       cycles  are  handled  gracefully,  by  performing  them  in the proper order.  Cycles are broken by first
       renaming one of the files to a temporary name.

                                               Collisions and Deletions

       When any two or more matching files would have to  be  moved,  copied,  or  linked  to  the  same  target
       filename,  <u>mmv</u>  detects the condition as an error before performing any actions.  Furthermore, <u>mmv</u> checks
       if any of its actions will result in the destruction of existing files.  If the  -d  (delete)  option  is
       specified,  all  file  deletions  or  overwrites are done silently.  Under -p (protect), all deletions or
       overwrites (except those specified with "(*)" on the standard input, see below) are  treated  as  errors.
       And  if  neither  option  is  specified, the user is queried about each deletion or overwrite separately.
       (The terminal is used for interactive queries, not standard input.)

                                                    Error Handling

       Whenever any error in the user's action specifications is detected, an error  message  is  given  on  the
       standard  output,  and  <u>mmv</u>  proceeds  to  check  the rest of the specified actions.  Once all errors are
       detected, <u>mmv</u> asks the user whether to continue by avoiding the erroneous actions or to abort altogether.
       This and all other queries may be avoided by specifying either the -g (go) or -t (terminate) option.  The
       former will resolve all difficulties by avoiding the erroneous actions; the latter will abort <u>mmv</u> if  any
       errors  are  detected.  Specifying either of them defaults <u>mmv</u> to -p, unless -d is specified (see above).
       Thus, -g and -t are most useful when running <u>mmv</u> in the background or in a shell script, when interactive
       queries are undesirable.

                                                        Reports

       Once the actions to be performed are determined,  <u>mmv</u>  performs  them  silently,  unless  either  the  -v
       (verbose)  or -n (no-execute) option is specified.  The former causes <u>mmv</u> to report each performed action
       on the standard output as

       a -&gt; b : done.

       Here, "a" and "b" would be replaced by the source and target names, respectively.  If the action  deletes
       the  old target, a "(*)" is inserted after the the target name.  Also, the "-&gt;" symbol is modified when a
       cycle has to be broken: the '&gt;' is changed to a '^' on the action  prior  to  which  the  old  target  is
       renamed to a temporary, and the '-' is changed to a '=' on the action where the temporary is used.

       Under  -n,  none  of  the  actions are performed, but messages like the above are printed on the standard
       output with the ": done." omitted.

       Although <u>mmv</u> attempts to predict all mishaps prior to performing any  specified  actions,  accidents  may
       happen.   For  example,  <u>mmv</u>  does  not  check  for  adequate free space when copying.  Thus, despite all
       efforts, it is still possible for an action to fail after some others have already been  done.   To  make
       recovery  as easy as possible, <u>mmv</u> reports which actions have already been done and which are still to be
       performed after such a failure occurs.  It then aborts, not attempting to do anything else.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Rename all <u>*.jpeg</u> files in the current directory to <u>*.jpg</u>:

          mmv '*.jpeg' '#1.jpg'

       Replace the first occurrence of <u>abc</u> with <u>xyz</u> in all files in the current directory:

          mmv '*abc*' '#1xyz#2'

       Rename files ending in <u>.html.en</u>, <u>.html.de</u>, etc. to ending in <u>.en.html</u>,  <u>.de.html</u>,  etc.  in  the  current
       directory:

          mmv '*.html.??' '#1.#2#3.html'

       Rename  music  files from <u>&lt;track</u> <u>no.&gt;</u> <u>-</u> <u>&lt;interpreter&gt;</u> <u>-</u> <u>&lt;song</u> <u>title&gt;.ogg</u> to <u>&lt;interpreter&gt;</u> <u>-</u> <u>&lt;track</u> <u>no.&gt;</u> <u>-</u>
       <u>&lt;song</u> <u>title&gt;.ogg</u> in the current directory:

          mmv '* - * - *.ogg' '#2 - #1 - #3.ogg'

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Mmv</u> exits with status 1 if it aborts before doing anything, with status 2 if it  aborts  due  to  failure
       after completing some of the actions, and with status 0 otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  search  pattern  is  not quoted, the shell expands the wildcards.  <u>Mmv</u> then (usually) gives some
       error message, but cannot determine that the lack of quotes is the cause.

       To avoid difficulties in semantics and error checking, <u>mmv</u> refuses to create directories.
