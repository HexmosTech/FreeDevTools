       fd - find entries in the filesystem

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fd</b>  [<b>-HIEsiaLp0hV</b>]  [<b>-d</b>  <u>depth</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>filetype</u>] [<b>-e</b> <u>ext</u>] [<b>-E</b> <u>exclude</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>when</u>] [<b>-j</b> <u>num</u>] [<b>-x</b> <u>cmd</u>] [<u>pattern</u>]
       [<u>path...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fd</b> is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to <b><a href="../man1/find.1.html">find</a></b>(1).

       By default <b>fd</b> uses regular expressions for the pattern. However, this can be changed to use  simple  glob
       patterns with the '--glob' option.

       By  default <b>fd</b> will exclude hidden files and directories, as well as any files that match gitignore rules
       or ignore rules in .ignore or .fdignore files.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-H,</b> <b>--hidden</b>
              Include hidden files and directories in the search results (default: hidden files and  directories
              are skipped). The flag can be overridden with '--no-hidden'.

              Ignored files are still excluded unless --no-ignore or --no-ignore-vcs is also used.

       <b>-I,</b> <b>--no-ignore</b>
              Show search results from files and directories that would otherwise be ignored by

              • <u>.gitignore</u>

              • <u>.git/info/exclude</u>

              • The global gitignore configuration (by default <u>$HOME/.config/git/ignore</u>)

              • <u>.ignore</u>

              • <u>.fdignore</u>

              • The global fd ignore file (usually <u>$HOME/.config/fd/ignore</u> )

              The flag can be overridden with '--ignore'.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--unrestricted</b>
              Perform an unrestricted search, including ignored and hidden files. This is an alias for '--hidden
              --no-ignore'.

       <b>--no-ignore-vcs</b>
              Show  search results from files and directories that would otherwise be ignored by gitignore files
              including <u>.gitignore</u>, <u>.git/info/exclude</u>, and the global gitignore configuration (<u>core.excludesFile</u>
              git setting, which defaults  to  <u>$HOME/.config/git/ignore</u>).   The  flag  can  be  overridden  with
              '--ignore-vcs'.

       <b>--no-require-git</b>
              Do  not  require  a  git repository to respect gitignores. By default, fd will only respect global
              gitignore rules, .gitignore rules and local exclude rules if fd detects  that  you  are  searching
              inside  a git repository. This flag allows you to relax this restriction such that fd will respect
              all git related ignore rules regardless of whether you’re searching in a git  repository  or  not.
              The flag can be overridden with '--require-git'.

       <b>--no-ignore-parent</b>
              Show  search results from files and directories that would otherwise be ignored by gitignore files
              in parent directories.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--case-sensitive</b>
              Perform a case-sensitive search. By default, fd uses case-insensitive searches, unless the pattern
              contains an uppercase character (smart case).

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--ignore-case</b>
              Perform a case-insensitive search. By default,  fd  uses  case-insensitive  searches,  unless  the
              pattern contains an uppercase character (smart case).

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--glob</b>
              Perform a glob-based search instead of a regular expression search.  If combined with the '--full-
              path' option, '**' can be used to match multiple path components.

       <b>--regex</b>
              Perform a regular-expression based search (default). This can be used to override --glob.

       <b>-F,</b> <b>--fixed-strings</b>
              Treat  the  pattern  as  a  literal  string  instead  of a regular expression. Note that this also
              performs substring comparison. If you want to match on an exact filename, consider using '--glob'.

       <b>--and</b> <u>pattern</u>
              Add additional required search patterns,  all  of  which  must  be  matched.  Multiple  additional
              patterns   can   be   specified.   The  patterns  are  regular  expressions,  unless  '--glob'  or
              '--fixed-strings' is used.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--absolute-path</b>
              Shows the full path starting from the root  as  opposed  to  relative  paths.   The  flag  can  be
              overridden with '--relative-path'.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--list-details</b>
              Use  a  detailed  listing format like 'ls -l'. This is basically an alias for '--exec-batch ls -l'
              with some additional 'ls' options. This can be used to see more metadata, to show symlink  targets
              and to achieve a deterministic sort order.

       <b>-L,</b> <b>--follow</b>
              By  default,  fd  does not descend into symlinked directories. Using this flag, symbolic links are
              also traversed. The flag can be overridden with '--no-follow'.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--full-path</b>
              By default, the search pattern is only matched against the filename  (or  directory  name).  Using
              this flag, the <u>pattern</u> is matched against the full path.

       <b>-0,</b> <b>--print0</b>
              Separate  search results by the null character (instead of newlines). Useful for piping results to
              <u>xargs</u>.

       <b>--max-results</b> <b>count</b>
              Limit the number of search results to 'count' and quit immediately.

       <b>-1</b>     Limit the search to a single result and quit immediately. This is an alias for '--max-results=1'.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              When the flag is present, the program does not print anything and will instead exit with a code of
              0 if there is at least one search result.  Otherwise, the exit code will be 1.  This is mainly for
              usage in scripts and can be faster than checking for output because  the  search  can  be  stopped
              early after the first match.  <b>--has-results</b> can be used as an alias.

       <b>--show-errors</b>
              Enable  the  display  of filesystem errors for situations such as insufficient permissions or dead
              symlinks.

       <b>--strip-cwd-prefix</b> <b>[when]</b>
              By default, relative paths are prefixed with './' when -x/--exec, -X/--exec-batch, or  -0/--print0
              are  given, to reduce the risk of a path starting with '-' being treated as a command line option.
              Use this flag to change this behavior. If this flag is used without a value, it is  equivalent  to
              passing "always". Possible values are:

              never  Never strip the ./ at the beginning of paths

              always Always strip the ./ at the beginning of paths

              auto   Only  strip  if  used  with  --exec,  --exec-batch,  or --print0. That is, it resets to the
                     default behavior.

       <b>--one-file-system,</b> <b>--mount,</b> <b>--xdev</b>
              By default, fd will traverse the file system tree as far as other options dictate. With this flag,
              fd ensures that it does not descend into a different file system  than  the  one  it  started  in.
              Comparable to the -mount or -xdev filters of <a href="../man1/find.1.html">find</a>(1).

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print help information.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print version information.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--max-depth</b> <u>d</u>
              Limit  directory  traversal  to  at  most  <u>d</u> levels of depth. By default, there is no limit on the
              search depth.

       <b>--min-depth</b> <u>d</u>
              Only show search results starting at the given depth. See also: '--max-depth' and '--exact-depth'.

       <b>--exact-depth</b> <u>d</u>
              Only show search results at the exact given depth. This  is  an  alias  for  '--min-depth  &lt;depth&gt;
              --max-depth &lt;depth&gt;'.

       <b>--prune</b>
              Do not traverse into matching directories.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--type</b> <u>filetype</u>
              Filter search by type:

              f, file
                     regular files

              d, dir, directory
                     directories

              l, symlink
                     symbolic links

              b, block-device
                     block devices

              c, char-device
                     character devices

              s, socket
                     sockets

              p, pipe
                     named pipes (FIFOs)

              x, executable
                     executable (files)

              e, empty
                     empty files or directories

              This option can be specified more than once to include multiple file types.  Searching for '--type
              file  --type symlink' will show both regular files as well as symlinks. Note that the 'executable'
              and 'empty' filters work differently: '--type executable' implies '--type file'  by  default.  And
              '--type  empty'  searches  for empty files and directories, unless either '--type file' or '--type
              directory' is specified in addition.

              Examples:
                - Only search for files:
                    fd --type file …
                    fd -tf …
                - Find both files and symlinks
                    fd --type file --type symlink …
                    fd -tf -tl …
                - Find executable files:
                    fd --type executable
                    fd -tx
                - Find empty files:
                    fd --type empty --type file
                    fd -te -tf
                - Find empty directories:
                    fd --type empty --type directory
                    fd -te -td

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--extension</b> <u>ext</u>
              Filter search results by file extension <u>ext</u>.  This option can be  used  repeatedly  to  allow  for
              multiple possible file extensions.

              If  you  want  to  search for files without extension, you can use the regex '^[^.]+$' as a normal
              search pattern.

       <b>-E,</b> <b>--exclude</b> <u>pattern</u>
              Exclude files/directories that match the given glob pattern.   This  overrides  any  other  ignore
              logic.  Multiple exclude patterns can be specified.  Examples:
                --exclude '*.pyc'
                --exclude node_modules

       <b>--ignore-file</b> <u>path</u>
              Add a custom ignore-file in '.gitignore' format.  These files have a low precedence.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--color</b> <u>when</u>
              Declare <u>when</u> to colorize search results:

              auto   Colorize output when standard output is connected to terminal (default).

              never  Do not colorize output.

              always Always colorize output.

       <b>--hyperlink</b>
              Specify  whether the output should use terminal escape codes to indicate a hyperlink to a file url
              pointing to the path.

              The value can be auto, always, or never.

              Currently, the default is "never", and if the option is used without an argument "auto"  is  used.
              In the future this may be changed to "auto" and "always".

              auto   Only  output  hyperlinks  if  color is also enabled, as a proxy for whether terminal escape
                     codes are acceptable.

              never  Never output hyperlink escapes.

              always Always output hyperlink escapes, regardless of color settings.

       <b>-j,</b> <b>--threads</b> <u>num</u>
              Set number of threads to use for searching &amp; executing (default: number of available CPU cores).

       <b>-S,</b> <b>--size</b> <u>size</u>
              Limit results based on the size of files using the format <u>&lt;+-&gt;&lt;NUM&gt;&lt;UNIT&gt;</u>

              '+'    file size must be greater than or equal to this

              '-'    file size must be less than or equal to this

              If neither '+' nor '-' is specified, file size must be exactly equal to this.

              'NUM'  The numeric size (e.g. 500)

              'UNIT' The units for NUM. They are not case-sensitive.  Allowed unit values:

                     'b'    bytes

                     'k'    kilobytes (base ten, 10^3 = 1000 bytes)

                     'm'    megabytes

                     'g'    gigabytes

                     't'    terabytes

                     'ki'   kibibytes (base two, 2^10 = 1024 bytes)

                     'mi'   mebibytes

                     'gi'   gibibytes

                     'ti'   tebibytes

       <b>--changed-within</b> <u>date|duration</u>
              Filter results based on the file modification time.  Files with modification  times  greater  than
              the  argument will be returned.  The argument can be provided as a duration (<u>10h,</u> <u>1d,</u> <u>35min</u>) or as
              a specific point in time as full RFC3339 format with time zone, as a date or datetime in the local
              time zone (<u>YYYY-MM-DD</u> or <u>YYYY-MM-DD</u> <u>HH:MM:SS</u>), or as the prefix '@'  followed  by  the  number  of
              seconds  since  the  Unix epoch (@[0-9]+).  <b>--change-newer-than</b>, <b>--newer</b> or <b>--changed-after</b> can be
              used as aliases.

              Examples:
                --changed-within 2weeks
                --change-newer-than "2018-10-27 10:00:00"
                --newer 2018-10-27
                --changed-after @1704067200

       <b>--changed-before</b> <u>date|duration</u>
              Filter results based on the file modification time.  Files with modification times less  than  the
              argument  will  be  returned.  The argument can be provided as a duration (<u>10h,</u> <u>1d,</u> <u>35min</u>) or as a
              specific point in time as full RFC3339 format with time zone, as a date or datetime in  the  local
              time  zone  (<u>YYYY-MM-DD</u>  or  <u>YYYY-MM-DD</u>  <u>HH:MM:SS</u>), or as the prefix '@' followed by the number of
              seconds since the Unix epoch (@[0-9]+).  <b>--change-older-than</b> or <b>--older</b> can be used as aliases.

              Examples:
                --changed-before "2018-10-27 10:00:00"
                --change-older-than 2weeks
                --older @1704067200

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--owner</b> <u>[user][:group]</u>
              Filter files by their user  and/or  group.  Format:  [(user|uid)][:(group|gid)].  Either  side  is
              optional. Precede either side with a '!' to exclude files instead.

              Examples:
                --owner john
                --owner :students
                --owner "!john:students"

       <b>--base-directory</b> <u>path</u>
              Change  the  current  working directory of fd to the provided path. This means that search results
              will be shown with respect to the given base path. Note that relative paths which are passed to fd
              via the positional <u>path</u> argument or the <b>--search-path</b> option will also  be  resolved  relative  to
              this directory.

       <b>--path-separator</b> <u>separator</u>
              Set  the  path separator to use when printing file paths. The default is the OS-specific separator
              ('/' on Unix, '\' on Windows).

       <b>--search-path</b> <u>search-path</u>
              Provide paths to search as an alternative to the positional <u>path</u> argument. Changes  the  usage  to
              ´fd [FLAGS/OPTIONS] --search-path PATH --search-path PATH2 [PATTERN]´

       <b>--format</b> <u>fmt</u>
              Specify a template string that is used for printing a line for each file found.

              The following placeholders are substituted into the string for each file before printing:

              {}     path (of the current search result)

              {/}    basename

              {//}   parent directory

              {.}    path without file extension

              {<a href="file:/.">/.</a>}   basename without file extension

              {{     literal '{' (an escape sequence)

              }}     literal '}' (an escape sequence)

              Notice  that  you  can  use  "{{" and "}}" to escape "{" and "}" respectively, which is especially
              useful if you need to include the literal text of one of the above placeholders.

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--exec</b> <u>command</u>
              Execute <u>command</u> for each search  result  in  parallel  (use  --threads=1  for  sequential  command
              execution).

              Note  that all subsequent positional arguments are considered to be arguments to the <u>command</u> - not
              to fd.  It is therefore recommended to place the -x/--exec option  last.  Alternatively,  you  can
              supply  a  ';'  argument  to end the argument list and continue with more fd options.  Most shells
              require ';' to be escaped: '\;'.  This option can be specified multiple times, in which  case  all
              commands  are  run  for  each  file  found, in the order they are provided. In that case, you must
              supply a ';' argument for all but the last commands.

              If parallelism is enabled, the order commands will be executed in is non-deterministic.  And  even
              with  --threads=1, the order is determined by the operating system and may not be what you expect.
              Thus, it is recommended that you don't rely on any ordering of the results.

              Before executing the command, any placeholder patterns  in  the  command  are  replaced  with  the
              corresponding  values  for  the  current file. The same placeholders are used as in the "--format"
              option.

              If no placeholder is present, an implicit "{}" at the end is assumed.

              Examples:

                - find all *.zip files and unzip them:

                      fd -e zip -x unzip

                - find *.h and *.cpp files and run "clang-format -i .." for each of them:

                      fd -e h -e cpp -x clang-format -i

                - Convert all *.jpg files to *.png files:

                      fd -e jpg -x convert {} {.}.png

       <b>-X,</b> <b>--exec-batch</b> <u>command</u>
              Execute <u>command</u> once, with all search results as arguments.

              The order of the arguments is non-deterministic and should not be relied upon.

              This uses the same placeholders as "--format" and "--exec", but  instead  of  expanding  once  per
              command  invocation  each argument containing a placeholder is expanding for every file in a batch
              and passed as separate arguments.

              If no placeholder is present, an implicit "{}" at the end is assumed.

              Like --exec, this can be used multiple times, in which case each command will be run in the  order
              given.

              Examples:

                - Find all test_*.py files and open them in your favorite editor:

                      fd -g 'test_*.py' -X vim

                  Note that this executes a single "vim" process with all search results as arguments.

                - Find all *.rs files and count the lines with "wc -l ...":

                      fd -e rs -X wc -l

       <b>--batch-size</b> <u>size</u>
              Maximum  number  of  arguments  to  pass to the command given with -X. If the number of results is
              greater than the given size, the command given with -X is run again with  remaining  arguments.  A
              batch  size  of  zero means there is no limit (default), but note that batching might still happen
              due to OS restrictions on the maximum length of command lines.

       The regular expression syntax used by fd is documented here:

           https://docs.rs/regex/1.0.0/regex/#syntax

       The glob syntax is documented here:

           https://docs.rs/globset/#syntax

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>LS_COLORS</b>
              Determines how to colorize search results, see <b><a href="../man1/dircolors.1.html">dircolors</a></b>(1)<b>.</b>

       <b>NO_COLOR</b>
              Disables colorized output.

       <b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME,</b> <b>HOME</b>
              Used to locate the global ignore file. If <b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b> is set, use  <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fd/ignore</u>.
              Otherwise, use <u>$HOME/.config/fd/ignore</u>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>.fdignore</b>
              This  file  works  similarly  to  a  .gitignore  file  anywhere in the searched tree and specifies
              patterns that should be excluded from the search. However, this file is specific to fd,  and  will
              be used even if the --no-ignore-vcs option is used.

       <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fd/ignore</b>
              Global  ignore file. Unless ignore mode is turned off (such as with --no-ignore) ignore entries in
              this file will be ignored, as if it was an .fdignore file in the current directory.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Find files and directories that match the pattern '<u>needle</u>':
              $ fd needle

       Start a search in a given directory (<u><a href="file:/var/log">/var/log</a></u>):
              $ fd nginx <a href="file:/var/log">/var/log</a>

       Find all Python files (all files with the extension <u>.py</u>) in the current directory:
              $ fd -e py

       Open all search results with vim:
              $ fd pattern -X vim

</pre><h4><b>Tips</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tricks</b></h4><pre>
       •      If you add ".git/" to your global ignore file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fd/ignore),  then  ".git"  folders
              will be ignored by default, even when the --hidden option is used.

       •      You can use a shell alias or a wrapper script in order to pass desired flags to fd by default. For
              example  if  you  do  not  like  the  default behavior of respecting gitignore, you can use `alias
              fd="/usr/bin/fd --no-ignore-vcs"` in your .bashrc to create an alias for fd  that  doesn't  ignore
              git files by default.
