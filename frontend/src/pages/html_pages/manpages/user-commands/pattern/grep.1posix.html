       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       grep — search a file for a pattern

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       grep <b>[</b>-E|-F<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-c|-l|-q<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-insvx<b>]</b> -e <u>pattern_list</u>
           <b>[</b>-e <u>pattern_list</u><b>]</b>... <b>[</b>-f <u>pattern_file</u><b>]</b>... <b>[</b><u>file</u>...<b>]</b>

       grep <b>[</b>-E|-F<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-c|-l|-q<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-insvx<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-e <u>pattern_list</u><b>]...</b>
           -f <u>pattern_file</u> <b>[</b>-f <u>pattern_file</u><b>]</b>... <b>[</b><u>file</u>...<b>]</b>

       grep <b>[</b>-E|-F<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-c|-l|-q<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-insvx<b>]</b> <u>pattern_list</u> <b>[</b><u>file</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>grep</u>  utility shall search the input files, selecting lines matching one or more patterns; the types
       of patterns are controlled by the options specified. The patterns are specified  by  the  <b>-e</b>  option,  <b>-f</b>
       option,  or  the  <u>pattern_list</u>  operand.  The  <u>pattern_list</u>'s value shall consist of one or more patterns
       separated by &lt;newline&gt; characters; the <u>pattern_file</u>'s contents shall consist  of  one  or  more  patterns
       terminated  by a &lt;newline&gt; character. By default, an input line shall be selected if any pattern, treated
       as an entire basic regular expression (BRE) as described in the Base Definitions volume of  POSIX.1‐2017,
       <u>Section</u> <u>9.3</u>, <u>Basic</u> <u>Regular</u> <u>Expressions</u>, matches any part of the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt;;
       a  null BRE shall match every line. By default, each selected input line shall be written to the standard
       output.

       Regular expression matching shall be based on text lines.  Since  a  &lt;newline&gt;  separates  or  terminates
       patterns  (see  the <b>-e</b> and <b>-f</b> options below), regular expressions cannot contain a &lt;newline&gt;.  Similarly,
       since patterns are matched against individual lines (excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt;  characters)  of
       the input, there is no way for a pattern to match a &lt;newline&gt; found in the input.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>grep</u>  utility  shall  conform  to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-E</b>        Match using extended regular expressions.  Treat each pattern specified as an ERE, as described
                 in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>9.4</u>, <u>Extended</u> <u>Regular</u> <u>Expressions</u>.   If
                 any  entire ERE pattern matches some part of an input line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt;,
                 the line shall be matched. A null ERE shall match every line.

       <b>-F</b>        Match using fixed strings. Treat each pattern specified  as  a  string  instead  of  a  regular
                 expression.  If  an  input line contains any of the patterns as a contiguous sequence of bytes,
                 the line shall be matched.  A null string shall match every line.

       <b>-c</b>        Write only a count of selected lines to standard output.

       <b>-e</b> <u>pattern_list</u>
                 Specify one or more patterns to be used during the search for  input.   The  application  shall
                 ensure  that  patterns  in  <u>pattern_list</u>  are  separated by a &lt;newline&gt;.  A null pattern can be
                 specified by two adjacent &lt;newline&gt; characters in <u>pattern_list</u>.  Unless the <b>-E</b> or <b>-F</b> option  is
                 also  specified,  each  pattern shall be treated as a BRE, as described in the Base Definitions
                 volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>9.3</u>, <u>Basic</u> <u>Regular</u> <u>Expressions</u>.  Multiple  <b>-e</b>  and  <b>-f</b>  options
                 shall  be  accepted  by  the  <u>grep</u>  utility.  All  of the specified patterns shall be used when
                 matching lines, but the order of evaluation is unspecified.

       <b>-f</b> <u>pattern_file</u>
                 Read one or more patterns from the file  named  by  the  pathname  <u>pattern_file</u>.   Patterns  in
                 <u>pattern_file</u>  shall  be terminated by a &lt;newline&gt;.  A null pattern can be specified by an empty
                 line in <u>pattern_file</u>.  Unless the <b>-E</b> or <b>-F</b> option is also  specified,  each  pattern  shall  be
                 treated  as  a  BRE,  as described in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>9.3</u>,
                 <u>Basic</u> <u>Regular</u> <u>Expressions</u>.

       <b>-i</b>        Perform pattern matching in searches without regard to case; see the Base Definitions volume of
                 POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>9.2</u>, <u>Regular</u> <u>Expression</u> <u>General</u> <u>Requirements</u>.

       <b>-l</b>        (The letter ell.) Write only the names of files containing selected lines to  standard  output.
                 Pathnames  shall  be  written  once  per  file  searched.  If the standard input is searched, a
                 pathname of <b>"(standard</b>input)" shall  be  written,  in  the  POSIX  locale.  In  other  locales,
                 <b>"standard</b>input" may be replaced by something more appropriate in those locales.

       <b>-n</b>        Precede each output line by its relative line number in the file, each file starting at line 1.
                 The line number counter shall be reset for each file processed.

       <b>-q</b>        Quiet. Nothing shall be written to the standard output, regardless of matching lines. Exit with
                 zero status if an input line is selected.

       <b>-s</b>        Suppress the error messages ordinarily written for nonexistent or unreadable files. Other error
                 messages shall not be suppressed.

       <b>-v</b>        Select  lines  not  matching  any of the specified patterns. If the <b>-v</b> option is not specified,
                 selected lines shall be those that match any of the specified patterns.

       <b>-x</b>        Consider only input lines that use  all  characters  in  the  line  excluding  the  terminating
                 &lt;newline&gt; to match an entire fixed string or regular expression to be matching lines.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>pattern_list</u>
                 Specify  one  or  more  patterns to be used during the search for input.  This operand shall be
                 treated as if it were specified as <b>-e</b> <u>pattern_list</u>.

       <u>file</u>      A pathname of a file to be searched for the patterns. If no <u>file</u> operands  are  specified,  the
                 standard input shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The  standard  input shall be used if no <u>file</u> operands are specified, and shall be used if a <u>file</u> operand
       is <b>'-'</b> and the implementation treats the <b>'-'</b> as meaning standard input.  Otherwise,  the  standard  input
       shall not be used.  See the INPUT FILES section.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The input files shall be text files.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>grep</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_COLLATE</u>
                 Determine the locale for the behavior  of  ranges,  equivalence  classes,  and  multi-character
                 collating elements within regular expressions.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files) and
                 the behavior of character classes within regular expressions.

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  <b>-l</b>  option  is  in  effect, the following shall be written for each file containing at least one
       selected input line:

           "%s\n", &lt;<u>file</u>&gt;

       Otherwise, if more than one <u>file</u> argument appears, and <b>-q</b> is not specified, the <u>grep</u> utility shall prefix
       each output line by:

           "%s:", &lt;<u>file</u>&gt;

       The remainder of each output line shall depend on the other options specified:

        *  If the <b>-c</b> option is in effect, the remainder of each output line shall contain:

               "%d\n", &lt;<u>count</u>&gt;

        *  Otherwise, if <b>-c</b> is not in effect and the <b>-n</b> option is in effect, the following shall be  written  to
           standard output:

               "%d:", &lt;<u>line</u> <u>number</u>&gt;

        *  Finally, the following shall be written to standard output:

               "%s", &lt;<u>selected-line</u> <u>contents</u>&gt;

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    One or more lines were selected.

        1    No lines were selected.

       &gt;1    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  <b>-q</b>  option  is specified, the exit status shall be zero if an input line is selected, even if an
       error was detected. Otherwise, default actions shall be performed.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Care should be taken when using characters in <u>pattern_list</u> that may also be  meaningful  to  the  command
       interpreter. It is safest to enclose the entire <u>pattern_list</u> argument in single-quotes:

           '...'

       The  <b>-e</b>  <u>pattern_list</u>  option  has  the  same  effect  as  the  <u>pattern_list</u>  operand, but is useful when
       <u>pattern_list</u> begins with the &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; delimiter. It is also useful when it is  more  convenient  to
       provide multiple patterns as separate arguments.

       Multiple  <b>-e</b>  and  <b>-f</b>  options  are accepted and <u>grep</u> uses all of the patterns it is given while matching
       input text lines.  (Note that the order of evaluation is not specified. If an implementation finds a null
       string as a pattern, it is allowed to use that pattern first, matching every line, and effectively ignore
       any other patterns.)

       The <b>-q</b> option provides a means of easily determining whether or not a pattern (or  string)  exists  in  a
       group  of files. When searching several files, it provides a performance improvement (because it can quit
       as soon as it finds the first match) and requires less care by the user in choosing the set of  files  to
       supply  as  arguments  (because it exits zero if it finds a match even if <u>grep</u> detected an access or read
       error on earlier <u>file</u> operands).

       When using <u>grep</u> to process pathnames, it is recommended that LC_ALL, or at least LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE,
       are set to POSIX or C in the environment, since pathnames can contain byte sequences  that  do  not  form
       valid  characters  in some locales, in which case the utility's behavior would be undefined. In the POSIX
       locale each byte is a valid single-byte character, and therefore this problem is avoided.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. To find all uses of the word <b>"Posix"</b> (in any case) in file <b>text.mm</b> and write with line numbers:

               grep -i -n posix text.mm

        2. To find all empty lines in the standard input:

               grep ^$

           or:

               grep -v .

        3. Both of the following commands print all lines containing strings <b>"abc"</b> or <b>"def"</b> or both:

               grep -E 'abc|def'

               grep -F 'abc
               def'

        4. Both of the following commands print all lines matching exactly <b>"abc"</b> or <b>"def"</b>:

               grep -E '^abc$|^def$'

               grep -F -x 'abc
               def'

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       This <u>grep</u> has been enhanced in an upwards-compatible way  to  provide  the  exact  functionality  of  the
       historical  <u>egrep</u>  and  <u>fgrep</u>  commands as well. It was the clear intention of the standard developers to
       consolidate the three <u>grep</u>s into a single command.

       The old <u>egrep</u> and <u>fgrep</u> commands are likely to be supported for many  years  to  come  as  implementation
       extensions, allowing historical applications to operate unmodified.

       Historical  implementations usually silently ignored all but one of multiply-specified <b>-e</b> and <b>-f</b> options,
       but were not consistent as to which specification was actually used.

       The <b>-b</b> option was omitted from the OPTIONS section because block numbers are implementation-defined.

       The System V restriction on using <b>-</b> to mean standard input was omitted.

       A definition of action taken when given a null BRE or ERE is specified.  This is an  error  condition  in
       some historical implementations.

       The  <b>-l</b>  option previously indicated that its use was undefined when no files were explicitly named. This
       behavior was historical and placed an unnecessary restriction on  future  implementations.  It  has  been
       removed.

       The  historical  BSD  <u>grep</u>  <b>-s</b>  option  practice  is  easily duplicated by redirecting standard output to
       <b>/dev/null</b>.  The <b>-s</b> option required here is from System V.

       The <b>-x</b> option, historically available only with <u>fgrep</u>, is available here for all of  the  non-obsolescent
       versions.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
