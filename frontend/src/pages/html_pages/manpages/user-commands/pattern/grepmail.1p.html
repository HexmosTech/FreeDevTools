</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       grepmail - search mailboxes for mail matching a regular expression

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         grepmail [--help|--version] [-abBDFhHilLmrRuvVw] [-C &lt;cache-file&gt;]
           [-j &lt;status&gt;] [-s &lt;sizespec&gt;] [-d &lt;date-specification&gt;]
           [-X &lt;signature-pattern&gt;] [-Y &lt;header-pattern&gt;]
           [[-e] &lt;pattern&gt;|-E &lt;expr&gt;|-f &lt;pattern-file&gt;] &lt;files...&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
         <u>grepmail</u> looks for mail messages containing a pattern, and prints the resulting messages on standard
         out.

         By default <u>grepmail</u> looks in both header and body for the specified pattern.

         When redirected to a file, the result is another mailbox, which can, in turn, be handled by standard
         User Agents, such as <u>elm</u>, or even used as input for another instance of <u>grepmail</u>.

         At least one of <b>-E</b>, <b>-e</b>, <b>-d</b>, <b>-s</b>, or <b>-u</b> must be specified. The pattern is optional if <b>-d</b>, <b>-s</b>, and/or <b>-u</b>
         is used. The <b>-e</b> flag is optional if there is no file whose name is the pattern. The <b>-E</b> option can be
         used to specify complex search expressions involving logical operators.  (See below.)

         If a mailbox can not be found, grepmail first searches the directory specified by the MAILDIR
         environment variable (if one is defined), then searches the $HOME/mail, $HOME/Mail, and $HOME/Mailbox
         directories.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Many of the options and arguments are analogous to those of grep.

       <b>pattern</b>
         The  pattern  to  search  for  in  the mail message.  May be any Perl regular expression, but should be
         quoted on the command line to protect against globbing (shell expansion). To search for more  than  one
         pattern, use the form "(pattern1|pattern2|...)".

         Note  that  complex  pattern  features  such  as "(?&gt;...)" require that you use a version of perl which
         supports them. You can use the pattern "()" to indicate that you do not want to match anything. This is
         useful if you want to initialize the cache without printing any output.

       <b>mailbox</b>
         Mailboxes must be traditional, UNIX "/bin/mail" mailbox format.  The mailboxes  may  be  compressed  by
         gzip, bzip2, lzip or xz, in which case the associated compression tool must be installed on the system,
         as well as a recent version of the Mail::Mbox::MessageParser Perl module that supports the format.

         If no mailbox is specified, takes input from stdin, which can be compressed or not. grepmail's behavior
         is undefined when ASCII and binary data is piped together as input.

       <b>-a</b>
         Use arrival date instead of sent date.

       <b>-b</b>
         Asserts that the pattern must match in the body of the email.

       <b>-B</b>
         Print  the body but with only minimal ('From ', 'From:', 'Subject:', 'Date:') headers. This flag can be
         used with -H, in which case it will print only short headers and no email bodies.

       <b>-C</b>
         Specifies the location of the cache file. The default is $HOME/.grepmail-cache.

       <b>-D</b>
         Enable debug mode, which prints diagnostic messages.

       <b>-d</b>
         Date specifications must be of the form of:
           - a date like "today", "yesterday", "5/18/93", "5 days ago", "5 weeks ago",
           - OR "before", "after", or "since", followed by a date as defined above,
           - OR "between &lt;date&gt; and &lt;date&gt;", where &lt;date&gt; is defined as above.

         Simple date expressions will first be parsed by Date::Parse. If this fails, grepmail  will  attempt  to
         parse  the  date with Date::Manip, if the module is installed on the system. Use an empty pattern (i.e.
         <b>-d</b> <b>""</b>) to find emails without a "Date: ..." line in the header.

         Date specifications without times are interpreted as having a time of midnight of that  day  (which  is
         the  morning),  except for "after" and "since" specifications, which are interpreted as midnight of the
         following day.  For example, "between today and tomorrow" is the same as simply  "today",  and  returns
         emails whose date has the current day. ("now" is interpreted as "today".) The date specification "after
         July 5th" will return emails whose date is midnight July 6th or later.

       <b>-E</b>
         Specify  a  complex  search  expression  using logical operators. The current syntax allows the user to
         specify search expressions using Perl syntax. Three values  can  be  used:  $email  (the  entire  email
         message), $email_header (just the header), or $email_body (just the body). A search is specified in the
         form  "$email  =~  /pattern/",  and multiple searches can be combined using "&amp;&amp;" and "||" for "and" and
         "or".

         For example, the expression

           $email_header =~ /^From: .*\@coppit.org/ &amp;&amp; $email =~ /grepmail/i

         will find all emails which originate from coppit.org (you must escape the "@" sign with  a  backslash),
         and which contain the keyword "grepmail" anywhere in the message, in any capitalization.

         <b>-E</b> is incompatible with <b>-b</b>, <b>-h</b>, and <b>-e</b>. <b>-i</b>, <b>-M</b>, <b>-S</b>, and <b>-Y</b> have not yet been implemented.

         NOTE: The syntax of search expressions may change in the future. In particular, support for size, date,
         and  other  constraints  may  be  added.  The syntax may also be simplified in order to make expression
         formation easier to use (and perhaps at the expense of reduced functionality).

       <b>-e</b>
         Explicitly specify the search pattern. This is useful for specifying  patterns  that  begin  with  "-",
         which would otherwise be interpreted as a flag.

       <b>-f</b>
         Obtain  patterns  from  FILE,  one  per  line.  The  empty  file  contains zero patterns, and therefore
         matches nothing.

       <b>-F</b>
         Force grepmail to process all files and streams as though they were mailboxes.  (i.e. Skip  checks  for
         non-mailbox ASCII files or binary files that don't look like they are compressed using known schemes.)

       <b>-h</b>
         Asserts that the pattern must match in the header of the email.

       <b>-H</b>
         Print the header but not body of matching emails.

       <b>-i</b>
         Make the search case-insensitive (by analogy to <u>grep</u> <u>-i</u>).

       <b>-j</b>
         Asserts that the email "Status:" header must contain the given flags. Order and case are not important,
         so use <u>-j</u> <u>AR</u> or <u>-j</u> <u>ra</u> to search for emails which have been read and answered.

       <b>-l</b>
         Output the names of files having an email matching the expression, (by analogy to <u>grep</u> <u>-l</u>).

       <b>-L</b>
         Follow symbolic links. (Implies <u>-R</u>)

       <b>-M</b>
         Causes  grepmail  to  ignore  non-text  MIME  attachments.  This removes false positives resulting from
         binaries encoded as ASCII attachments.

       <b>-m</b>
         Append "X-Mailfolder: &lt;folder&gt;" to all email headers, indicating which  folder  contained  the  matched
         email.

       <b>-n</b>
         Prefix  each  line  with  line  number  information. If multiple files are specified, the filename will
         precede the line number. NOTE: When used in conjunction with <b>-m</b>, the X-Mailfolder header has  the  same
         line number as the next (blank) line.

       <b>-q</b>
         Quiet mode. Suppress the output of warning messages about non-mailbox files, directories, etc.

       <b>-r</b>
         Generate  a  report  of  the names of the files containing emails matching the expression, along with a
         count of the number of matching emails.

       <b>-R</b>
         Causes grepmail to recurse any directories encountered.

       <b>-s</b>
         Return emails which match the size (in bytes) specified with this flag. Note that  this  size  includes
         the length of the header.

         Size constraints must be of the form of:
          - 12345: match size of exactly 12345
          - &lt;12345, &lt;=12345, &gt;12345, &gt;=12345: match size less than, less than or equal,
            greater than, or greater than or equal to 12345
          - 10000-12345: match size between 10000 and 12345 inclusive

       <b>-S</b>
         Ignore signatures. The signature consists of everything after a line consisting of "-- ".

       <b>-u</b>
         Output  only unique emails, by analogy to <u>sort</u> <u>-u</u>. Grepmail determines email uniqueness by the Message-
         ID header.

       <b>-v</b>
         Invert the sense of the search, by analogy to <u>grep</u> <u>-v</u>. This results in the set of emails printed  being
         the complement of those that would be printed without the <b>-v</b> switch.

       <b>-V</b>
         Print the version and exit.

       <b>-w</b>
         Search  for  only those lines which contain the pattern as part of a word group.  That is, the start of
         the pattern must match the start of a word, and the end of the pattern must match the end  of  a  word.
         (Note that the start and end need not be for the <u>same</u> word.)

         If  you  are  familiar with Perl regular expressions, this flag simply puts a "\b" before and after the
         search pattern.

       <b>-X</b>
         Specify a regular expression for the signature separator. By default this pattern is '^-- $'.

       <b>-Y</b>
         Specify a pattern which indicates specific headers to be searched. The search will automatically  treat
         headers which span multiple lines as one long line.  This flag implies <b>-h</b>.

         In the style of procmail, special strings in the pattern will be expanded as follows:

           If the regular expression contains "^TO:" it will be substituted by

             ^((Original-)?(Resent-)?(To|Cc|Bcc)|(X-Envelope|Apparently(-Resent)?)-To):

           which should match all headers with destination addresses.

           If the regular expression contains "^FROM_DAEMON:" it  will be substituted by

             (^(Mailing-List:|Precedence:.*(junk|bulk|list)|To: Multiple recipients of |(((Resent-)?(From|Sender)|X-Envelope-From):|&gt;?From )([^&gt;]*[^(.%@a-z0-9])?(Post(ma?(st(e?r)?|n)|office)|(send)?Mail(er)?|daemon|m(mdf|ajordomo)|n?uucp|LIST(SERV|proc)|NETSERV|o(wner|ps)|r(e(quest|sponse)|oot)|b(ounce|bs\.smtp)|echo|mirror|s(erv(ices?|er)|mtp(error)?|ystem)|A(dmin(istrator)?|MMGR|utoanswer))(([^).!:a-z0-9][-_a-z0-9]*)?[%@&gt;\t ][^&lt;)]*(\(.*\).*)?)?

           which should catch mails coming from most daemons.

           If  the regular expression contains "^FROM_MAILER:" it will be substituted by

             (^(((Resent-)?(From|Sender)|X-Envelope-From):|&gt;?From)([^&gt;]*[^(.%@a-z0-9])?(Post(ma(st(er)?|n)|office)|(send)?Mail(er)?|daemon|mmdf|n?uucp|ops|r(esponse|oot)|(bbs\.)?smtp(error)?|s(erv(ices?|er)|ystem)|A(dmin(istrator)?|MMGR))(([^).!:a-z0-9][-_a-z0-9]*)?[%@&gt;\t][^&lt;)]*(\(.*\).*)?)?$([^&gt;]|$))

           (a  stripped  down  version  of  "^FROM_DAEMON:"),  which should catch mails coming from most mailer-
           daemons.

           So, to search for all emails to or from "Andy":

             grepmail -Y '(^TO:|^From:)' Andy mailbox

       <b>--help</b>
         Print a help message summarizing the usage.

       <b>--</b>
         All arguments following <u>--</u> are treated as mail folders.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Count the number of emails. ("." matches every email.)

         grepmail -r . sent-mail

       Get all email between 2000 and 3000 bytes about books

         grepmail books -s 2000-3000 sent-mail

       Get all email that you mailed yesterday

         grepmail -d yesterday sent-mail

       Get all email that you mailed before the first thursday in June 1998 that pertains to research  (requires
       Date::Manip):

         grepmail research -d "before 1st thursday in June 1998" sent-mail

       Get all email that you mailed before the first of June 1998 that pertains to research:

         grepmail research -d "before 6/1/98" sent-mail

       Get all email you received since 8/20/98 that wasn't about research or your job, ignoring case:

         grepmail -iv "(research|job)" -d "since 8/20/98" saved-mail

       Get  all  email  about  mime  but  not about Netscape. Constrain the search to match the body, since most
       headers contain the text "mime":

         grepmail -b mime saved-mail | grepmail Netscape -v

       Print a list of all mailboxes containing a message from Rodney. Constrain  the  search  to  the  headers,
       since quoted emails may match the pattern:

         grepmail -hl "^From.*Rodney" saved-mail*

       Find all emails with the text "Pilot" in both the header and the body:

         grepmail -hb "Pilot" saved-mail*

       Print a count of the number of messages about grepmail in all saved-mail mailboxes:

         grepmail -br grepmail saved-mail*

       Remove any duplicates from a mailbox:

         grepmail -u saved-mail

       Convert a Gnus mailbox to mbox format:

         grepmail . gnus-mailbox-dir/* &gt; mbox

       Search  for  all  emails  to or from an address (taking into account wrapped headers and different header
       names):

         grepmail -Y '(^TO:|^From:)' <a href="mailto:my@email.address">my@email.address</a> saved-mail

       Find all emails from postmasters:

         grepmail -Y '^FROM_MAILER:' . saved-mail

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       grepmail will <u>not</u> create temporary files while decompressing compressed archives. The last version to  do
       this  was  3.5. While the new design uses more memory, the code is much simpler, and there is less chance
       that email can be read by malicious third parties. Memory usage is determined by the size of the  largest
       email message in the mailbox.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  MAILDIR  environment variable can be used to specify the default mail directory. This directory will
       be searched if the specified mailbox can not be found directly.

       The HOME environment variable is also used to find mailboxes if they can not be  found  directly.  It  is
       also used to store grepmail state information such as its cache file.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Patterns containing "$" may cause problems
         Currently  I  look for "$" followed by a non-word character and replace it with the line ending for the
         current file (either "\n" or "\r\n"). This may cause problems with complex patterns specified with  -E,
         but I'm not aware of any.

       Mails without bodies cause problems
         According  to  RFC  822,  mail  messages  need  not have message bodies. I've found and removed one bug
         related to this. I'm not sure if there are others.

       Complex single-point dates not parsed correctly
         If you specify a point date like "September 1, 2004", grepmail creates a date range that  includes  the
         entire  day  of  September 1, 2004. If you specify a complex point date such as "today", "1st Monday in
         July", or "9/1/2004 at 0:00" grepmail may parse the time incorrectly.

         The reason for this problem is that Date::Manip, as of version 5.42, forces default values  for  parsed
         dates and times. This means that grepmail has a hard time determining whether the user supplied certain
         time/date  fields.  (e.g.  Did Date::Manip provide a default time of 0:00, or did the user specify it?)
         grepmail tries to work around this problem, but the workaround is inherently incomplete  in  some  rare
         cases.

       File names that look like flags cause problems.
         In  some special circumstances, grepmail will be confused by files whose names look like flags. In such
         cases, use the <b>-e</b> flag to specify the search pattern.
