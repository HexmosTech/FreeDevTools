</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpg-check-pattern</b> - Check a passphrase on stdin against the patternfile

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpg-check-pattern</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>patternfile</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpg-check-pattern</b> checks a passphrase given on stdin against a specified pattern file.

       The  pattern file is line based with comment lines beginning on the <u>first</u> position with a <b>#</b>.  Empty lines
       and lines with only white spaces are ignored.  The actual pattern lines may  either  be  verbatim  string
       pattern  and match as they are (trailing spaces are ignored) or extended regular expressions indicated by
       a <b>/</b> or <b>!/</b> in the first column and terminated by another <b>/</b> or end of line.  If a regular expression starts
       with <b>!/</b> the match result is reversed. By default all comparisons are case insensitive.

       Tag lines may be used to further control the operation of this tool.  The currently defined tags are:

       <b>[icase]</b>
              Switch to case insensitive comparison for all further patterns.  This is the default.

       <b>[case]</b> Switch to case sensitive comparison for all further patterns.

       <b>[reject]</b>
              Switch to reject mode.  This is the default mode.

       <b>[accept]</b>
              Switch to accept mode.

       In the future more tags may be introduced and thus it is advisable not to start a  plain  pattern  string
       with  an open bracket.  The tags must be given verbatim on the line with no spaces to the left or any non
       white space characters to the right.

       In reject mode the program exits on the first match with an exit code of 1 (failure).  If at the  end  of
       the pattern list the reject mode is still active the program exits with code 0 (success).

       In accept mode blocks of patterns are used.  A block starts at the next pattern after an "accept" tag and
       ends  with  the  last pattern before the next "accept" or "reject" tag or at the end of the pattern list.
       If all patterns in a block match the program exits with an exit code of 0 (success).  If any pattern in a
       block do not match the next pattern block is evaluated.  If at the end of the  pattern  list  the  accept
       mode is still active the program exits with code 1 (failure).
