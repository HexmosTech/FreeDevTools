</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nettle-pbkdf2 - Command-line password-based key derivation tool.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nettle-pbkdf2</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>SALT</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  documents  briefly  the  <b>nettle-pbkdf2</b> command.  This manual page was written for the
       Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       <b>nettle-pbkdf2</b>  is  a  front-end  for  Nettle's  PBKDF2  (Password-Based  Key   Derivation   Function   2)
       implementation. PBKDF2 applies a pseudo-random function to a passphrase together with a salt, producing a
       <u>derived</u> <u>key</u> of arbitrary length. By iterating the process many times, feeding the output of each round as
       the  input of the next, brute-force cracking of the password is made to take correspondingly longer time.
       The use of a salt makes it harder to use  dictionaries  or  rainbow  tables.  As  computers  become  more
       powerful, the number of iterations can be increased without changing the rest of the algorithm.

       The pseudo-random function used by this tool is currently HMAC-SHA256.

       The  password  is read from standard input and the resulting derived key is written to standard output in
       groups of 16 hexadecimal digits, unless the --raw option is used. The salt and number of  iterations  are
       not included in the output.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').
       A summary of options is included below.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--length=</b><u>length</u>
              Desired output length in octets.

       <b>--raw</b>  Output derived key in raw binary format.

       <b>--hex-salt</b>
              Specifies that <u>SALT</u> is provided in hexadecimal format.

       <b>--help</b> Show summary of options.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Show version of program.
