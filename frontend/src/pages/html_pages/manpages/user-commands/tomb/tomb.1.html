</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Tomb - the Crypto Undertaker

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       tomb [options] command [arguments]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Tomb  is  an application to manage the creation and access of encrypted storage files: it can be operated
       from commandline and it can integrate with a user's graphical desktop.

       Tomb generates encrypted storage files to be opened and closed using their  associated  keys,  which  are
       also protected with a password chosen by the user. To create, open and close tombs a user will need super
       user rights to execute the tomb commandline utility.

       A  tomb  is like a locked folder that can be safely transported and hidden in a filesystem; it encourages
       users to keep their keys separate from tombs, for instance keeping a tomb file on your computer  harddisk
       and its key file on a USB stick.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       dig    Generates  a  file that can be used as a tomb and will occupy as much space as its desired initial
              size, the unlocked <u>.tomb</u> file can then be locked using a <u>key</u>. It takes a mandatory <u>-s</u> option which
              is the size in megabytes (MiB). Tombs are digged using random data gathered  from  a  non-blocking
              source (/dev/urandom). For very large tombs this may take up too much time and entropy, then it is
              possible  to  use  <u><a href="../man1/fallocate.1.html">fallocate</a>(1)</u>  being aware it does not pre-fill with random data, decreasing the
              tomb's security.

       forge  Creates a new <u>key</u> and prompts the user for  a  <u>password</u>  to  protect  its  usage  using  symmetric
              encryption.  This  operation uses random data from a non-blocking source (/dev/urandom) and it may
              take long only in some cases; to switch using a blocking source the <u>--use-random</u> flag can be used.
              The <u>-g</u> option switches on the use of a GPG key instead of a password (asymmetric encryption), then
              the <u>-r</u> option indicates the recipient  key;  more  recipient  GPG  ids  can  be  indicated  (comma
              separated).  The  default cipher to protect the key is AES256, a custom one can be specified using
              the <u>-o</u> option, for a  list  of  supported  ciphers  use  <u>-v</u>.  For  additional  protection  against
              dictionary attacks on keys, the <u>--kdf</u> option can be used when forging a key.

       lock   Initializes and locks an empty tomb (made with <u>dig</u>) using a key (made with <u>forge</u>), making it ready
              for  usage. After this operation, the tomb can only be opened in possession of the key and knowing
              its password. As in any other command requiring a key, the option <u>-k</u> should be used to  specify  a
              key  file;  in  case of encryption to GPG recipients the <u>-g</u> flag should be used followed by <u>-r</u> and
              the recipient's secret GPG key id.  The <u>-o</u> option can be used to specify the cipher specification:
              default is "aes-xts-plain64", old versions  of  Tomb  used  "aes-cbc-essiv:sha256".   If  you  are
              looking  for  something  exotic,  also  try  "serpent-xts-plain64".  More  options may be found in
              <a href="../man8/cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup</a>(8) and Linux  documentation.  The  <u>--filesystem</u>  option  can  be  used  to  specify  an
              alternative  filesystem  used  to  format the tomb, in place of the default "ext4". This operation
              requires root privileges to loopback mount, format the tomb (using LUKS and mkfs),  then  set  the
              key in its first LUKS slot.

              Supported filesystems for <u>--filesystem</u>:
              ext3           using operating system defaults
              ext4           using operating system defaults
              btrfs          for tombs &gt;= 47MB using operating system defaults
              btrfsmixedmode for tombs &gt;=18MB btrfs mixed mode (see <a href="../man8/mkfs.btrfs.8.html">mkfs.btrfs</a>(8))
              ext3maxinodes  ext3 with a maximum of inodes (for many small files)
              ext4maxinodes  ext4 with a maximum of inodes (for many small files)

       open   Opens  an  existing  <u>tomb</u> <u>file</u> (first argument) using a key (<u>-k</u>) which can also be hidden inside a
              <u>jpeg</u> <u>image</u> (see <u>bury</u>/<u>exhume</u>) or a long text file (see<u>cloak</u>/<u>uncloak</u>). If a second argument is given
              it will indicate the <u>mountpoint</u> where the tomb should be made accessible, else the tomb is mounted
              in a directory inside <a href="file:/media">/media</a> (if not available it uses /run/media/$USER).  The option  <u>-o</u>  can  be
              used  to pass <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a>(8) options (default: rw,noatime,nodev). The <u>-g</u> option is needed when using GPG
              encryption to recipients.

       list   List all the tombs found open, including information about the time they were opened and the hooks
              that they mounted. If the first argument is present, then shows only the tomb named  that  way  or
              returns  an  error  if  it's not found. If the option <u>--get-mountpoint</u> is used then print a simple
              list of currently open tomb mountpoint paths.

       ps     List all the processes found running inside the tombs that are open, printing out their  PIDs  and
              owners.  This  is useful to have an overview of programs that are keeping the tombs busy and would
              eventually be killed by the <u>slam</u> command. The <a href="../man8/lsof.8.html">lsof</a>(8) utility  is  used  internally  to  enumerate
              processes running in one or all tombs.

       index  Creates  or  updates  the  search  indexes  of all tombs currently open: enables use of the <u>search</u>
              command using simple word patterns on file names. Indexes are created using plocate's  <a href="../man8/updatedb.8.html">updatedb</a>(8)
              and <a href="../man1/recoll.1.html">recoll</a>(1) if they are found on the system. Indexes allow one to search very fast for filenames
              and  contents  inside  a  tomb,  they  are  stored inside it and are not accessible if the Tomb is
              closed. To avoid indexing a specific tomb simply touch a <u>.noindex</u> file in  it.   Useful  tools  to
              have: poppler-utils, aspell, xdg-utils, plocate.

       search Takes any string as argument and searches for them through all tombs currently open and previously
              indexed  using  the  <u>index</u> command.  The search matches filenames if plocate is installed and then
              also file contents if recoll is installed, all results are listed on the console.   One  can  also
              run recoll's GUI using <u>recoll</u> <u>-c</u> <u>/media/tomb</u>

       close  Closes  a  currently  open  tomb.   If  more  tombs are open, the first argument should be used to
              specify the name of the tomb to be closed, or <u>all</u> to close all currently open tombs. This  command
              fails if the tomb is in use by running processes (to force close, see <u>slam</u> below).

       slam   Closes a tomb like the command <u>close</u> does, but it doesn't fail even if the tomb is in use by other
              application  processes:  it  looks  for  and closes each of them (in order: TERM, HUP, KILL). This
              command may provoke unsaved data loss, but assists users to face surprise situations. It  requires
              <u>lsof</u> else it falls back to <u>close</u>.

       passwd Changes  the  password  protecting  a  key  file  specified  using <u>-k</u>. With keys encrypted for GPG
              recipients use <u>-g</u> followed by <u>-r</u> to indicate the new recipient key, or a  comma  separated  list..
              The  user  will  need  to  know the key's current password, or possess at least one of the current
              recipients GPG secret keys, because the key contents will be decoded and reencoded using  the  new
              passwords  or  keys.  If  the key file is broken (missing headers) this function also attempts its
              recovery.

       setkey Changes the key file that locks a tomb, substituting the old one with a new one. Both the old  and
              the  new  key  files  are needed for this operation and their passwords or GPG recipient(s) secret
              keys must be available. The new key must be specified using the  <u>-k</u>  option,  the  first  argument
              should  be the old key and the second and last argument the tomb file. Use the <u>-g</u> option to unlock
              the tomb with a GPG key, the <u>-r</u> to indicate the recipient or a comma separated list for more  than
              one recipient.

       resize Increase  the  size of a tomb file to the amount specified by the <u>-s</u> option, which is the new size
              in megabytes (MiB). Full access to the tomb using a key (<u>-k</u>) and its password is  required.  Tombs
              can  only  grow  and can never be made smaller. This command makes use of the <a href="../man8/cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup</a>(8) resize
              feature and the resize2fs command: its much more practical than creating a  new  tomb  and  moving
              everything  into  it.  There is no data-loss if a failure occurs during resize: the command can be
              re-launched and the resize operation will complete.

       engrave
              This command transforms a tomb key into an image that can  be  printed  on  paper  and  physically
              stored  as  backup, i.e. hidden in a book. It Renders a QRCode of the tomb key, still protected by
              its password: a PNG image (extension <u>.qr.png</u>) will be created in the current directory and can  be
              later  printed  (fits  an A4 or Letter format).  To recover an engraved key one can use any QRCode
              reader on a smartphone: save it into a file and then use that file as a key (<u>-k</u>).

       bury   Hides a tomb key (<u>-k</u>) inside a <u>jpeg</u> <u>image</u> (first argument) using  <u>steganography</u>:  the  image  will
              change  in  a  way  that cannot be noticed by human eye and hardly detected by data analysis. This
              option is useful to backup tomb keys in unsuspected places; it depends from  the  availability  of
              <u>steghide</u>. Use the <u>-g</u> flag and <u>-r</u> option followed by recipient id to use GPG asymmetric encryption.

       exhume This  command recovers from jpeg images the keys that were previously hidden into them using <u>bury</u>.
              Exhume requires a key filename (<u>-k</u>) and a <u>jpeg</u> <u>image</u> file (first argument) known to be  containing
              a  key. If the right key password is given, the key will be exhumed. If the password is not known,
              it is very hard to verify if a key is buried in any image or not.

       cloak  Cloaks a tomb key (<u>-k</u>) disguising it as text using a cipher  file  (first  argument)  writing  the
              result    to    stdout    or    optionally    an    output    file    (second    argument).    See
              <u>/usr/share/doc/tomb/examples/cloak-ciphers</u> for potential cipher files. However, it is  recommended
              to  create  and  use  one's own ciphers.  This option is useful to backup tomb keys in unsuspected
              places.

       uncloak
              Recovers a tomb key from a cloaked text file. Uncloak requires a text  file  (first  argument),  a
              cipher  file  (second  argument)  and optionally an output file (third argument). If the first two
              parameters are correct then the output will be a valid tomb key file restored from cloak.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -k <u>&lt;keyfile&gt;</u>
              For all operations requiring a key, this option specifies the location of the  key  file  to  use.
              Arguments  can  also  be  <u>jpeg</u>  <u>image</u>  files  where  keys have been hidden using the <u>bury</u> or <u>cloak</u>
              commands, or text files retrieved from <u>engraved</u> QR codes. If the <u>keyfile</u> argument is  "-"  (dash),
              Tomb will read the key from stdin (blocking).

       -n     Skip  processing  of exec-hooks and bind-hooks if found inside the tomb.  See the <u>HOOKS</u> section in
              this manual for more information.

       -p     When opening a tomb, preserves the ownership  of  all  files  and  directories  contained  in  it.
              Normally  the  <u>open</u>  command  changes the ownership of a tomb's contents to the UID and GID of the
              user who has successfully opened it: it is a usability feature in case a tomb is used by a  single
              user across different systems. This flag deactivates this behaviour.

       -o     Manually  specify  mount  options  to  be  used  when  opening  a  tomb  instead  of  the  default
              <u>rw,noatime,nodev</u>, i.e. to mount a tomb read-only (ro) to prevent any modification of its data. Can
              also be used to change the  symmetric  encryption  algorithm  for  keys  during  <u>forge</u>  operations
              (default <u>AES256</u>) or the LUKS encryption method during <u>lock</u> operations (default <u>aes-xts-plain64</u>).

       -f     Force  flag,  currently used to override swap checks, might be overriding more wimpy behaviours in
              future, but make sure you know what you are doing if you force an operation.

       -s <u>&lt;MBytes&gt;</u>
              When digging or resizing a tomb, this option must be used to specify the <u>size</u> of the new  file  to
              be created. Units are megabytes (MiB).

       -g     Tell  tomb to use a asymmetric GnuPG key encryption instead of a symmetric passphrase to protect a
              tomb key. This option can be followed by <u>-r</u> when the command needs to specify recipient(s).

       -r <u>&lt;gpg_id&gt;[,&lt;gpg_id2&gt;]</u>
              Provide a new set of recipient(s) to encrypt a tomb key. <u>gpg_ids</u> can be one or more  GPG  key  ID,
              comma separated. All GPG keys must be trusted keys in GPG.

       --kdf <u>&lt;itertime&gt;</u>
              Activate  the  KDF  feature  against  dictionary  attacks  when  creating a key: forces a delay of
              <u>&lt;itertime&gt;</u> times every time this key is used.  The actual time to wait depends on  the  CPU  speed
              (default) or the RAM size (argon2) of the computer where the key is used.  Using 5 or 10 is a sane
              amount for modern computers, the value is multiplied by 1 million.

       --kdftype <u>argon2</u> <u>|</u> <u>pbkdf2</u>
              Adopt  the  <u>argon2</u>  algorithm for KDF, stressing the RAM capacity rather than the CPU speed of the
              computer decrypting the tomb. Requires the <u>argon2</u> binary by P-H-C to be installed, as packaged  by
              most distros.  Default is <u>pbkdf2</u>.

       --kdfmem <u>&lt;memory&gt;</u>
              In  case  of  <u>argon2</u>  KDF  algorithm,  this value specifies the size of RAM used: it consists of a
              number which is the elevated power of two in kilobytes.  Default is 18 which is 250  MiB  (2^18  =
              262,144 kilobytes).

       --sudo <u>&lt;executable&gt;</u>
              Select  a  different  tool than sudo for privilege escalation.  Alternatives supported so far are:
              pkexec, doas, sup, sud. For any alternative to work the executable must be included in the current
              PATH.

       --sphx-user <u>&lt;username&gt;</u>
              Activate the SPHINX feature for password-authenticated key agreement.  This option  indicates  the
              <u>&lt;username&gt;</u> used to retrieve the password from a sphinx oracle key reachable via TCP/IP.

       --sphx-host <u>&lt;domain&gt;</u>
              Activate  the  SPHINX feature for password-authenticated key agreement.  This option indicates the
              <u>&lt;domain&gt;</u> used to retrieve the password from a sphinx oracle daemon reachable via TCP/IP.  This  is
              not the network address of the daemon, which is configured in /etc/sphinx

       -h     Display a help text and quit.

       -v     Display version and quit.

       -q     Run more quietly

       -D     Print more information while running, for debugging purposes

</pre><h4><b>DEV</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       --no-color
              Suppress colors in console output (needed for string parsing by wrappers).

       --unsafe
              Enable  using  dev-mode arguments, i.e. to pass passwords from commandline options. This is mostly
              used needed for execution by wrappers and testing suite.

       --use-random
              Use a blocking random source. Tomb uses by default /dev/urandom since the non-blocking  source  of
              Linux kernel doesn't degrades the quality of random.

       --tomb-pwd &lt;string&gt;
              Use string as password when needed on tomb.

       --tomb-old-pwd &lt;string&gt;
              Use  string  as  old password when needed in tomb commands requiring multiple keys, like <u>passwd</u> or
              <u>setkey</u>.

       -U     Switch to this user ID when dropping privileges.

       -G     Switch to this group ID when dropping privileges.

       -T     Switch to this TTY terminal when dropping privileges.

</pre><h4><b>HOOKS</b></h4><pre>
       Hooks are special files that can be placed inside the tomb and trigger actions  when  it  is  opened  and
       closed;  there  are  two kinds of such files: <u>bind-hooks</u> and <u>exec-hooks</u> can be placed in the base root of
       the tomb.

       bind-hooks
              This hook file consists of a simple text file named <u>bind-hooks</u> containing a  two  column  list  of
              paths  to  files  or  directories inside the tomb. The files and directories will be made directly
              accessible by the tomb <u>open</u> command inside the current user's home directory. Tomb uses internally
              the "mount -o bind" command to bind locations inside the tomb to locations found in $HOME. In  the
              first column are indicated paths relative to the tomb and in the second column are indicated paths
              relative to $HOME contents, for example:
                   mail          mail
                   .gnupg        .gnupg
                   .fmrc         .fetchmailrc
                   .mozilla      .mozilla

       exec-hooks
              This  hook  file  gets  executed  as  user by tomb with the first argument determining the step of
              execution (<u>open</u> or <u>close</u>) and the second being the full path to  the  mountpoint.  The  <u>exec-hooks</u>
              file  should  be  executable (ELF or shell script) and present inside the Tomb. Tomb executes this
              hook as user and adds the  name,  loopback  device  and  dev-mapper  device  paths  as  additional
              arguments for the <u>close</u> command.

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGE</b> <b>ESCALATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  tomb  commandline  tool  needs to acquire super user rights to execute most of its operations: so it
       uses <a href="../man8/sudo.8.html">sudo</a>(8) or other configured tools, while <a href="../man1/pinentry.1.html">pinentry</a>(1) is adopted to collect passwords from the  user.
       Tomb executes as super user only when required.

       To  be made available on multi user systems, the superuser execution of the tomb script can be authorized
       for users without jeopardizing the whole system's security: just add such a line to <u><a href="file:/etc/sudoers">/etc/sudoers</a></u>:

            username ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/tomb

       To avoid that tomb execution is logged by <u>syslog</u> also add:

            Cmnd_Alias TOMB = /usr/local/bin/tomb
            Defaults!TOMB !syslog

</pre><h4><b>PASSWORD</b> <b>INPUT</b></h4><pre>
       Password input is handled by the pinentry program: it can be text  based  or  graphical  and  is  usually
       configured  with  a  symlink.  When  using  Tomb  in X11 it is better to use a graphical pinentry-gtk2 or
       pinentry-qt because it helps preventing keylogging by other X clients. When using it from  a  remote  ssh
       connection  it  might  be necessary to force use of pinentry-curses for instance by unsetting the DISPLAY
       environment var.

</pre><h4><b>SWAP</b></h4><pre>
       On execution of certain commands Tomb will complain about swap memory on disk when present and  <u>abort</u>  <u>if</u>
       <u>your</u>  <u>system</u>  <u>has</u>  <u>swap</u>  <u>activated</u>.  You can disable this behaviour using the <u>--force</u>. Before doing that,
       however, you may be interested in knowing the risks of doing so:

       •      During such operations a lack of available memory could cause the swap to write your secret key on
              the disk.

       •      Even while using an opened tomb, another application could occupy too much memory so that the swap
              needs to be used, this way it is possible that some contents of files contained into the tomb  are
              physically written on your disk, not encrypted.

       If  you  don't  need  swap,  execute  <u>swapoff</u> <u>-a</u>. If you really need it, you could make an encrypted swap
       partition. Tomb doesn't detect if your swap is encrypted, and will complain anyway.

</pre><h4><b>DENIABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The possibility to have an encrypted  volume  which  is  invisible  and  cannot  be  detected  is  called
       "deniability".  The  cryptographic  layer  of  the  device  mapper in Linux (dm-crypt) does not implement
       deniability. Tomb is just a wrapper on top of that and it doesn't add cryptographic deniability.  However
       a  certain  way of using tomb can facilitate a weak sort of deniability outside of the scenario of seized
       devices and forensic analysis of files and blocks on disc.

       For instance to eliminate any trace of tomb usage from the shell  history  ZSh  users  can  activate  the
       "HISTIGNORESPACE"  feature  and prefix all invocations of tomb with a blank space, including two lines in
       ".zshrc":

            export HISTIGNORESPACE=1
            alias tomb=' tomb'

</pre><h4><b>PASSWORD</b> <b>INPUT</b></h4><pre>
       Tomb uses the external program "pinentry" to let users type  the  key  password  into  a  terminal  or  a
       graphical  window.  This program works in conjunction with "gpg-agent", a daemon running in background to
       facilitate secret key management with gpg. It is recommended one runs "gpg-agent" launching it from the X
       session initialization ("<a href="file:~/.xsession">~/.xsession</a>" or "<a href="file:~/.xinitrc">~/.xinitrc</a>" files) with this command:

            eval $(gpg-agent --daemon --write-env-file "${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info")

       In the future it may become mandatory to run gpg-agent when using tomb.

</pre><h4><b>SHARE</b> <b>A</b> <b>TOMB</b></h4><pre>
       A tomb key can be encrypted with more than one  recipient.  Therefore,  a  tomb  can  be  shared  between
       different users. The recipients are given using the <u>-r</u> (or/and <u>-R</u>) option and if multiple each GPG key ID
       must  be  separated by a comma (<u>,</u>). Sharing a tomb is a very sensitive action and the user needs to trust
       that all the GPG public keys used are kept safe. If one of them its stolen or lost,  it  will  be  always
       possible  to use it to access the tomb key unless all its copies are destroyed. The <u>-r</u> option can be used
       in the tomb commands: <u>open</u>, <u>forge</u> <u>setkey</u>, <u>passwd</u>, <u>bury</u>, <u>exhume</u> and <u>resize</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SPHINX</b> <b>(PAKE)</b></h4><pre>
       Using the package libsphinx https://github.com/stef/libsphinx and its python client/daemon implementation
       pwdsphinx https://github.com/stef/pwdsphinx is possible to store and retrieve safely  the  password  that
       locks  the  tomb.  Using this feature will make it impossible to retrieve the password without the oracle
       sphinx server running and reachable. Each key entry needs a username and a domain specified  on  creation
       and a password that locks it.

       SPHINX  makes it impossible to maliciously retrieve the password locking the tomb key without an attacker
       accessing both the server, the sphinx password and the tomb key file.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       •      Create a 128MB large "secret" tomb and its keys, then open it:

                   tomb dig -s 128 secret.tomb

                   tomb forge secret.tomb.key

                   tomb lock secret.tomb -k secret.tomb.key

                   tomb open secret.tomb -k secret.tomb.key

       •      Open a Tomb using the key from a remote SSH shell, without saving any local copy of it:

                   ssh <a href="mailto:user@my.shell.net">user@my.shell.net</a> 'cat .secrets/tomb.key' | tomb open secret.tomb -k -

       •      Open a Tomb on a remote server passing the unencrypted local key on stdin via SSH, without  saving
              any remote copy of it:

                   gpg -d .secrets/tomb.key | ssh server tomb open secret.tomb -k cleartext --unsafe

       •      Create  a bind hook that places your GnuPG folder inside the tomb, but makes it reachable from the
              standard $HOME/.gnupg location every time the tomb will be opened:

                   tomb open GPG.tomb -k GPG.tomb.key
                   echo ".gnupg .gnupg" &gt; /media/GPG.tomb/bind-hooks
                   mv <a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a> /media/GPG.tomb/.gnupg &amp;&amp; mkdir <a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a>
                   tomb close GPG &amp;&amp; tomb open GPG.tomb -k GPG.tomb.key

       •      Script a tomb to launch the Firefox browser every time is opened, keeping  all  its  profile  data
              inside it:

                   tomb open FOX.tomb -k FOX.tomb.key
                   cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /media/FOX.tomb/exec-hooks
              #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
              if [ "$1" = "open" ]; then
                   firefox -no-remote -profile "$2"/firefox-pro &amp;
              fi
              EOF
                   chmod +x /media/FOX.tomb/exec-hooks
                   mkdir /media/FOX.tomb/firefox-pro

       •      Script a tomb to archive Pictures using Shotwell, launching it on open:

                   tomb open Pictures.tomb -k Pictures.tomb.key
                   cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /media/Pictures.tomb/bind-hooks
              Pictures Pictures
              EOF
                   cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /media/Pictures.tomb/exec-hooks
              #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
              if [ "$1" = "open" ]; then
                   which shotwell &gt; /dev/null
                   if [ "$?" = "0" ]; then
                        shotwell -d "$2"/Pictures/.shotwell &amp;
                   fi
              fi
              EOF
                   chmod +x /media/Pictures.tomb/exec-hooks
