</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sleep — suspend execution for an interval

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       sleep <u>time</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>sleep</u>  utility  shall suspend execution for at least the integral number of seconds specified by the
       <u>time</u> operand.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>time</u>      A non-negative decimal integer specifying the number of seconds for which to suspend execution.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>sleep</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       If the <u>sleep</u> utility receives a SIGALRM signal, one of the following actions shall be taken:

        1. Terminate normally with a zero exit status.

        2. Effectively ignore the signal.

        3. Provide the default behavior for signals described in the ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section of <u>Section</u> <u>1.4</u>,
           <u>Utility</u> <u>Description</u> <u>Defaults</u>.  This could include terminating with a non-zero exit status.

       The <u>sleep</u> utility shall take the standard action for all other signals.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The  execution  was  successfully  suspended  for  at  least  <u>time</u> seconds, or a SIGALRM signal was
             received. See the ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>sleep</u> utility can be used to execute a command after a certain amount of time, as in:

           (sleep 105; <u>command</u>) &amp;

       or to execute a command every so often, as in:

           while true
           do
               <u>command</u>
               sleep 37
           done

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status is allowed to be zero when <u>sleep</u> is  interrupted  by  the  SIGALRM  signal  because  most
       implementations  of  this  utility  rely  on the arrival of that signal to notify them that the requested
       finishing time has been  successfully  attained.  Such  implementations  thus  do  not  distinguish  this
       situation  from the successful completion case. Other implementations are allowed to catch the signal and
       go back to sleep until the requested time expires or to provide the normal signal termination procedures.

       As with all other utilities that take integral operands and do not specify subranges of  allowed  values,
       <u>sleep</u>  is required by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 to deal with <u>time</u> requests of up to 2147483647 seconds.
       This may mean that some implementations have to make  multiple  calls  to  the  delay  mechanism  of  the
       underlying operating system if its argument range is less than this.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
