       nhmmer - search DNA queries against a DNA sequence database

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nhmmer</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>queryfile</u> <u>seqdb</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nhmmer</b> is used to search one or more nucleotide queries against a nucleotide sequence database.  For each
       query  in  <u>queryfile</u>,  use  that  query to search the target database of sequences in <u>seqdb</u>, and output a
       ranked list of the hits with the most significant matches to the query. A query may be either  a  profile
       model  built using <b>hmmbuild</b>, a sequence alignment, or a single sequence. Sequence based queries can be in
       a number of formats (see <b>--qformat</b>), and can typically be autodetected. Note that only  Stockholm  format
       supports queries made up of more than one sequence alignment.

       Either  the  query  <u>queryfile</u>  or the target <u>seqdb</u> may be '-' (a dash character), in which case the query
       file or target database input will be read from a &lt;stdin&gt; pipe instead of from a  file.  Only  one  input
       source  can  come  through  &lt;stdin&gt;, not both.  If the <u>queryfile</u> contains more than one query, then <u>seqdb</u>
       cannot come from stdin, because we can't rewind the streaming target database to search it  with  another
       profile.

       If  the  query  is sequence-based (unaligned or aligned), a new file containing the HMM(s) built from the
       input(s) in <u>queryfile</u> may optionally be produced, with the filename set using the <b>--hmmout</b> flag.

       The output format is designed to be human-readable, but  is  often  so  voluminous  that  reading  it  is
       impractical,  and  parsing it is a pain. The <b>--tblout</b> option saves output in a simple tabular format that
       is concise and easier to parse.  The <b>-o</b> option allows redirecting the main output, including throwing  it
       away in /dev/null.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available options.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-o</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> Direct the main human-readable output to a file <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> instead of the default stdout.

       <b>-A</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> Save a multiple alignment of all significant hits (those satisfying "inclusion thresholds") to the
              file <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>.

       <b>--tblout</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>
              Save a simple tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the per-target output, with one data line
              per homologous target sequence found.

       <b>--dfamtblout</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>
              Save a tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the per-hit output, similar to <b>--tblout</b> but more
              succinct.

       <b>--aliscoresout</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>
              Save  to  file  a  list  of  per-position  scores  for  each hit.  This is useful, for example, in
              identifying regions of high score density for use in resolving  overlapping  hits  from  different
              models.

       <b>--hmmout</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>
              If <u>queryfile</u> is sequence-based, write the internally-computed HMM(s) to file <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>.

       <b>--acc</b>  Use accessions instead of names in the main output, where available for profiles and/or sequences.

       <b>--noali</b>
              Omit the alignment section from the main output. This can greatly reduce the output volume.

       <b>--notextw</b>
              Unlimit  the  length of each line in the main output. The default is a limit of 120 characters per
              line, which helps in displaying the output cleanly on terminals and in editors, but  can  truncate
              target profile description lines.

       <b>--textw</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Set the main output's line length limit to <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> characters per line. The default is 120.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>SINGLE</b> <b>SEQUENCE</b> <b>SCORING</b></h4><pre>
       By  default,  if  a  query  is  a single sequence from a file in fasta format, <b>nhmmer</b> uses a search model
       constructed from that sequence and a standard 20x20 substitution matrix for residue probabilities,  along
       with  two  additional  parameters  for  position-independent gap open and gap extend probabilities. These
       options allow the default single-sequence scoring parameters  to  be  changed,  and  for  single-sequence
       scoring options to be applied to a single sequence coming from an aligned format.

       <b>--singlemx</b>
              If  a  single  sequence  query comes from a multiple sequence alignment file, such as in Stockholm
              format, the search model is by default constructed as is  typically  done  for  multiple  sequence
              alignments.  This  option  forces <b>nhmmer</b> to use the single-sequence method with substitution score
              matrix.

       <b>--mxfile</b><u>&lt;mxfile</u>
              Obtain residue alignment probabilities from the substitution matrix in file <u>mxfile</u>.   The  default
              score  matrix  is  DNA1  (this  matrix is internal to HMMER and does not have to be available as a
              file).  The format of a substitution matrix <u>mxfile</u> is  the  standard  format  accepted  by  BLAST,
              FASTA, and other sequence analysis software.  See <b>ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/matrices/</b> for example
              files.  (The  only  exception: we require matrices to be square, so for DNA, use files like NCBI's
              NUC.4.4, not NUC.4.2.)

       <b>--popen</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set the gap open probability for a single sequence query model to <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.  The default is 0.02.   <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              must be &gt;= 0 and &lt; 0.5.

       <b>--pextend</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set the gap extend probability for a single sequence query model to <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.  The default is 0.4.  <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              must be &gt;= 0 and &lt; 1.0.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>REPORTING</b> <b>THRESHOLDS</b></h4><pre>
       Reporting  thresholds  control  which  hits  are reported in output files (the main output, <b>--tblout</b>, and
       <b>--dfamtblout</b>).  Hits are ranked by statistical significance (E-value).

       <b>-E</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> Report target sequences with an E-value of &lt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.  The default is 10.0, meaning that on  average,
              about  10  false  positives  will  be  reported per query, so you can see the top of the noise and
              decide for yourself if it's really noise.

       <b>-T</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> Instead of thresholding output on E-value, instead report target sequences with a bit score of  &gt;=
              <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>INCLUSION</b> <b>THRESHOLDS</b></h4><pre>
       Inclusion thresholds are stricter than reporting thresholds.  Inclusion thresholds control which hits are
       considered  to  be reliable enough to be included in an output alignment or a subsequent search round, or
       marked as significant ("!") as opposed to questionable ("?")  in hit output.

       <b>--incE</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Use an E-value of &lt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> as the inclusion  threshold.   The  default  is  0.01,  meaning  that  on
              average,  about  1  false  positive  would  be expected in every 100 searches with different query
              sequences.

       <b>--incT</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Instead of using E-values for setting the inclusion threshold, use a bit score of &gt;=  <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>  as  the
              inclusion threshold.  By default this option is unset.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>MODEL-SPECIFIC</b> <b>SCORE</b> <b>THRESHOLDING</b></h4><pre>
       Curated  profile  databases  may  define  specific bit score thresholds for each profile, superseding any
       thresholding based on statistical significance alone.

       To use these options, the profile must contain  the  appropriate  (GA,  TC,  and/or  NC)  optional  score
       threshold  annotation;  this  is  picked  up  by  <b>hmmbuild</b>  from  Stockholm format alignment files. For a
       nucleotide model, each thresholding option has a single per-hit threshold &lt;x&gt; This  acts  as  if  <b>-T</b>  <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
       <b>--incT</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> has been applied specifically using each model's curated thresholds.

       <b>--cut_ga</b>
              Use  the  GA  (gathering)  bit score threshold in the model to set per-hit reporting and inclusion
              thresholds. GA thresholds are generally considered to be the reliable curated thresholds  defining
              family  membership;  for  example,  in Dfam, these thresholds are applied when annotating a genome
              with a model of a family known to be found in that organism. They may allow for  minimal  expected
              false discovery rate.

       <b>--cut_nc</b>
              Use  the NC (noise cutoff) bit score threshold in the model to set per-hit reporting and inclusion
              thresholds. NC thresholds are less stringent than GA; in the context of Pfam, they  are  generally
              used to store the score of the highest-scoring known false positive.

       <b>--cut_tc</b>
              Use  the  TC  (trusted  cutoff)  bit  score  threshold  in  the model to set per-hit reporting and
              inclusion thresholds. TC thresholds are more stringent than GA, and are generally considered to be
              the score of the lowest-scoring known true positive that is above all known false  positives;  for
              example,  in  Dfam, these thresholds are applied when annotating a genome with a model of a family
              not known to be found in that organism.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>ACCELERATION</b> <b>PIPELINE</b></h4><pre>
       HMMER3 searches are accelerated in a three-step filter pipeline: the  scanning-SSV  filter,  the  Viterbi
       filter,  and  the  Forward  filter. The first filter is the fastest and most approximate; the last is the
       full Forward scoring algorithm. There is also a bias filter step between SSV and  Viterbi.  Targets  that
       pass  all  the  steps  in  the  acceleration  pipeline  are  then  subjected  to postprocessing -- domain
       identification and scoring using the Forward/Backward algorithm.

       Changing filter  thresholds  only  removes  or  includes  targets  from  consideration;  changing  filter
       thresholds  does  not  alter  bit  scores, E-values, or alignments, all of which are determined solely in
       postprocessing.

       <b>--max</b>  Turn off  (nearly)  all  filters,  including  the  bias  filter,  and  run  full  Forward/Backward
              postprocessing  on  most  of the target sequence.  In contrast to <b>phmmer</b> and <b>hmmsearch</b>, where this
              flag really does turn off the filters entirely, the <b>--max</b> flag in  <b>nhmmer</b>  sets  the  scanning-SSV
              filter threshold to 0.4, not 1.0. Use of this flag increases sensitivity somewhat, at a large cost
              in speed.

       <b>--F1</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set  the  P-value threshold for the SSV filter step.  The default is 0.02, meaning that roughly 2%
              of the highest scoring nonhomologous targets are expected to pass the filter.

       <b>--F2</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set the P-value threshold for the Viterbi filter step.  The default is 0.001.

       <b>--F3</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set the P-value threshold for the Forward filter step.  The default is 1e-5.

       <b>--nobias</b>
              Turn off the bias filter. This increases sensitivity somewhat, but can come  at  a  high  cost  in
              speed,  especially  if  the  query  has  biased residue composition (such as a repetitive sequence
              region, or if it is a membrane protein with large regions of  hydrophobicity).  Without  the  bias
              filter,  too  many  sequences  may  pass  the  filter  with biased queries, leading to slower than
              expected performance as the computationally  intensive  Forward/Backward  algorithms  shoulder  an
              abnormally heavy load.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>SPECIFYING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>ALPHABET</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--dna</b>  Assert that sequences in <u>msafile</u> are DNA, bypassing alphabet autodetection.

       <b>--rna</b>  Assert that sequences in <u>msafile</u> are RNA, bypassing alphabet autodetection.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>SEED</b> <b>SEARCH</b> <b>HEURISTIC</b></h4><pre>
       When  searching with <b>nhmmer</b>, one may optionally precompute a binary version of the target database, using
       <b>makehmmerdb</b>, then search against that database. Using default settings, this  yields  a  roughly  10-fold
       acceleration  with  small  loss  of sensitivity on benchmarks.  This is achieved using a heuristic method
       that searches for seeds (ungapped alignments) around which full processing is done. This is essentially a
       replacement to the SSV stage. (This method has been extensively tested, but should still  be  treated  as
       somewhat experimental.)  The following options only impact <b>nhmmer</b> if the value of <b>--tformat</b> is <b>hmmerdb</b>.

       Changing  parameters for this seed-finding step will impact both speed and sensitivity - typically faster
       search leads to lower sensitivity.

       <b>--seed_max_depth</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              The seed step requires that a seed reach a specified bit score in length no longer than  <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>.   By
              default, this value is 15. Longer seeds allow a greater chance of meeting the bit score threshold,
              leading to diminished filtering (greater sensitivity, slower run time).

       <b>--seed_sc_thresh</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              The  seed  must  reach score <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> (in bits). The default is 15.0 bits. A higher threshold increases
              filtering stringency, leading to faster run times and lower sensitivity.

       <b>--seed_sc_density</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Either all prefixes or all suffixes of a seed must have bit density (bits per aligned position) of
              at least <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.  The default is 0.8 bits/position. An increase in the density requirement  leads  to
              increased filtering stringency, thus faster run times and lower sensitivity.

       <b>--seed_drop_max_len</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              A  seed  may  not  have  a  run of length <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> in which the score drops by <b>--seed_drop_lim</b> or more.
              Basically, this prunes seeds that go through long slightly-negative seed extensions.  The  default
              is  4.   Increasing  the  limit causes (slightly) diminished filtering efficiency, thus slower run
              times and higher sensitivity. (minor tuning option)

       <b>--seed_drop_lim</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              In a seed, there may be no  run  of  length  <b>--seed_drop_max_len</b>  in  which  the  score  drops  by
              <b>--seed_drop_lim</b>.   The  default  is  0.3  bits. Larger numbers mean less filtering.  (minor tuning
              option)

       <b>--seed_req_pos</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              A seed must contain a run of at least <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> positive-scoring  matches.  The  default  is  5.  Larger
              values mean increased filtering.  (minor tuning option)

       <b>--seed_ssv_length</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              After  finding a short seed, an ungapped alignment is extended in both directions in an attempt to
              meet the <b>--F1</b> score threshold. The window through which this ungapped alignment extends is  length
              <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>.   The  default  is  70.   Decreasing this value slightly reduces run time, at a small risk of
              reduced sensitivity. (minor tuning option)

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--qformat</b> <u>&lt;s&gt;</u>
              Assert that input <u>queryfile</u> is a sequence file (unaligned or aligned), in  format  <u>&lt;s&gt;</u>,  bypassing
              format  autodetection.   Common  choices for <u>&lt;s&gt;</u> include: <b>fasta</b>, <b>embl</b>, <b>genbank.</b>  Alignment formats
              also work, and will serve as the basis for automatic creation of a profile HMM used for searching;
              common choices include: <b>stockholm</b>, <b>a2m</b>, <b>afa</b>, <b>psiblast</b>, <b>clustal</b>, <b>phylip</b>.  For more information, and
              for codes for some less common formats, see main documentation.

       <b>--qsingle_seqs</b>
              Force <u>queryfile</u> to be read as individual sequences, even if it is in an msa format.  For  example,
              if the input is in aligned <b>stockholm</b> format, the <b>--qsingle_seqs</b>
               flag will cause each sequence in that alignment to be used as a separate query sequence.

       <b>--tformat</b> <u>&lt;s&gt;</u>
              Assert  that  target  sequence  database  <u>seqdb</u>  is in format <u>&lt;s&gt;</u>, bypassing format autodetection.
              Common choices for <u>&lt;s&gt;</u> include: <b>fasta</b>, <b>embl</b>,  <b>genbank</b>,  <b>fmindex</b>.   Alignment  formats  also  work;
              common choices include: <b>stockholm</b>, <b>a2m</b>, <b>afa</b>, <b>psiblast</b>, <b>clustal</b>, <b>phylip</b>.  For more information, and
              for  codes  for  some  less  common  formats,  see  main  documentation.   The string <u>&lt;s&gt;</u> is case-
              insensitive (<b>fasta</b> or <b>FASTA</b> both work).  The format <b>fmindex</b> indicates that the database file is  a
              binary file produced using <b>makehmmerdb</b>.

       <b>--nonull2</b>
              Turn off the null2 score corrections for biased composition.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> For  the  purposes  of  per-hit  E-value  calculations,  Assert  that the total size of the target
              database is <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> million nucleotides, rather than the actual number of targets seen.

       <b>--seed</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Set the random number seed to <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>.  Some steps in postprocessing require Monte  Carlo  simulation.
              The  default  is  to  use  a  fixed seed (42), so that results are exactly reproducible. Any other
              positive integer will give different (but also  reproducible)  results.  A  choice  of  0  uses  a
              randomly chosen seed.

       <b>--w_beta</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Window  length  tail  mass.   The upper bound, <u>W</u>, on the length at which nhmmer expects to find an
              instance of the model is set such that the fraction of all sequences generated by the  model  with
              length  &gt;=  W is less than <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.  The default is 1e-7.  This flag may be used to override the value
              of <u>W</u> established for the model by <b>hmmbuild</b>, or when the query is sequence-based.

       <b>--w_length</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Override the model instance length upper bound, W, which is otherwise controlled by <b>--w_beta</b>.   It
              should  be larger than the model length. The value of W is used deep in the acceleration pipeline,
              and modest changes are not expected to impact results (though larger values of W do lead to longer
              run time).  This flag may be used to override  the  value  of  W  established  for  the  model  by
              <b>hmmbuild</b>, or when the query is sequence-based.

       <b>--watson</b>
              Only  search  the  top  strand.  By default both the query sequence and its reverse-complement are
              searched.

       <b>--crick</b>
              Only search the bottom (reverse-complement) strand. By default both the  query  sequence  and  its
              reverse-complement are searched.

       <b>--cpu</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Set  the  number of parallel worker threads to <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>.  On multicore machines, the default is 2.  You
              can also control this number by setting an environment variable,  <u>HMMER_NCPU</u>.   There  is  also  a
              master thread, so the actual number of threads that HMMER spawns is <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>+1.

              This option is not available if HMMER was compiled with POSIX threads support turned off.

       <b>--stall</b>
              For  debugging the MPI master/worker version: pause after start, to enable the developer to attach
              debuggers to the running master and worker(s) processes. Send SIGCONT signal to release the pause.
