</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       deb-gview - GNOME viewer for .deb package files and contents

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>deb-gview</u> displays Debian control information, devscript details and details of the files that would be
       installed (names, sizes and locations). Files within the package can be viewed within the package or
       externally.

       <u>deb-gview</u> accepts package files on the command line to support the 'open' command in various file
       managers, one window for each package. Individual views can be closed independently or simultaneously
       using 'Quit'.

       Packages do not need to be installed to be viewed. Packages do not need to be suitable for installation,
       e.g. a foreign architecture.

       Package files and .changes files can be viewed from local and remote filesystems.

       When loading .changes files, <u>deb-gview</u> will load each referenced package in a new window. When opening a
       .changes file from the <u>deb-gview</u> toolbar, the original window is not changed.

       When opening Debian packages files from the <u>deb-gview</u> toolbar, the package data will replace the current
       window data.

   <b>Usage:</b>
       deb-gview [<u>OPTIONS</u>] [<u>file</u>...]

   <b>COMMAND:</b>
       <b>file</b>
           One or more Debian package files (.deb) to preload or a .changes file referencing various package
           files.

           Individual package files or a set of packages referenced in a .changes file can be viewed from local
           and remote filesystems.

   <b>GUI</b> <b>Options:</b>
       See also gtk-options (7).

       <b>--display</b>=<u>DISPLAY</u>
           X display to use

   <b>Help</b> <b>Options:</b>
       -h, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options

       -v, <b>--version</b>
           Show version number

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>PREVIEWS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>deb-gview</u> has migrated to the XDG specification for config files and uses a dot-file in your XDG config
       directory (default: <a href="file:~/.config/deb-gview/preview">~/.config/deb-gview/preview</a>) to specify which applications should be used to preview
       files from the package. You are free to edit this file, deb-gview will not modify it, although the
       defaults will be replaced if the file is deleted.

       Any previous config in <a href="file:~/.deb-gview/preview">~/.deb-gview/preview</a> will be moved into the new file but the <a href="file:~/.deb-gview">~/.deb-gview</a>
       directory will be preserved - feel free to delete it once any other files are moved to the new location.

       The first matching pattern will be used, so put the most general wildcards (like *) at the end of this
       file.

   <b>GROUPS</b>
       The first group contains two <u>deb-gview</u> default settings. 'terminal' determines which application to use
       for viewers that need a terminal. You may want to change this to <u>gnome-terminal</u> or <u>konsole</u> from the
       rather limited <u>xterm</u> default. 'execute_command' specifies the command to pass to the terminal application
       to load an external command within the terminal. Most terminal emulators support '-e' for this command.

       Subsequent group names need to be unique but have no other meaning to <u>deb-gview</u>.

   <b>KEYS</b>
       <b>pattern</b>: glob-style pattern to match the location of the file in the package (not the filesystem).

       <b>viewer</b>: the program to call to view the file content (which must exist in your system PATH).

       <b>use_terminal</b>: whether to start the viewer in a terminal, TRUE or FALSE.

       <b>binary_file</b>: whether the viewer requires the content as a binary file, TRUE or FALSE. Typically, image
       previews require a binary file.

       <b>file_suffix</b>: if the viewer needs a specific suffix, specify it here. Note that <u>deb-gview</u> does not insist
       that the suffix of the temporary file matches the suffix of the file within the package, it is up to you
       to ensure that the suffix is suitable for the viewer you want to use. Leave blank for no suffix.

   <b>DEFAULT</b> <b>VALUES</b>
       The defaults for file previews are:

           # Your choice of terminal application.
           #
           [deb-gview]
           terminal=xterm
