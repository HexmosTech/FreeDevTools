</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dpkg-deb - Debian package archive (.deb) manipulation tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpkg-deb</b> [<u>option</u>...] <u>command</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpkg-deb</b> packs, unpacks and provides information about Debian archives.

       Use <b>dpkg</b> to install and remove packages from your system.

       You can also invoke <b>dpkg-deb</b> by calling <b>dpkg</b> with whatever options you want to pass to <b>dpkg-deb</b>.  <b>dpkg</b>
       will spot that you wanted <b>dpkg-deb</b> and run it for you.

       For most commands taking an input archive argument, the archive can be read from standard input if the
       archive name is given as a single minus character («<b>-</b>»); otherwise lack of support will be documented in
       their respective command description.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b>, <b>--build</b> <u>binary-directory</u> [<u>archive</u>|<u>directory</u>]
           Creates  a debian archive from the filesystem tree stored in <u>binary-directory</u>.  <u>binary-directory</u> must
           have a <b>DEBIAN</b> subdirectory, which contains the control information files such  as  the  control  file
           itself.   This  directory will <u>not</u> appear in the binary package's filesystem archive, but instead the
           files in it will be put in the binary package's control information area.

           Unless you specify <b>--no-check</b>, <b>dpkg-deb</b> will read <b>DEBIAN/control</b> and parse it.   It  will  check  the
           file  for  syntax  errors and other problems, and display the name of the binary package being built.
           <b>dpkg-deb</b> will also check the permissions of the maintainer scripts  and  other  files  found  in  the
           <b>DEBIAN</b> control information directory.

           If no <u>archive</u> is specified then <b>dpkg-deb</b> will write the package into the file <u>binary-directory</u><b>.deb</b>.

           If the archive to be created already exists it will be overwritten.

           If    the   second   argument   is   a   directory   then   <b>dpkg-deb</b>   will   write   to   the   file
           <u>directory</u><b>/</b><u>package_version_arch</u><b>.deb.</b>  When a target directory is specified, rather than  a  file,  the
           <b>--no-check</b> option may not be used (since <b>dpkg-deb</b> needs to read and parse the package control file to
           determine which filename to use).

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--info</b> <u>archive</u> [<u>control-file-name</u>...]
           Provides information about a binary package archive.

           If no <u>control-file-name</u>s are specified then it will print a summary of the contents of the package as
           well as its control file.

           If  any  <u>control-file-name</u>s  are  specified  then  <b>dpkg-deb</b>  will  print  them in the order they were
           specified; if any of the components weren't present it will print an error message  to  stderr  about
           each one and exit with status 2.

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--show</b> <u>archive</u>
           Provides  information  about  a  binary  package  archive in the format specified by the <b>--showformat</b>
           argument.  The default format displays the package's name and version on one  line,  separated  by  a
           tabulator.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--field</b> <u>archive</u> [<u>control-field-name</u>...]
           Extracts control file information from a binary package archive.

           If no <u>control-field-name</u>s are specified then it will print the whole control file.

           If  any  are  specified then <b>dpkg-deb</b> will print their contents, in the order in which they appear in
           the control file.  If more than one <u>control-field-name</u> is specified then <b>dpkg-deb</b> will  precede  each
           with its field name (and a colon and space).

           No errors are reported for fields requested but not found.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--contents</b> <u>archive</u>
           Lists  the  contents  of the filesystem tree archive portion of the package archive.  It is currently
           produced in the format generated by <b>tar</b>'s verbose listing.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--extract</b> <u>archive</u> <u>directory</u>
           Extracts the filesystem tree from a package archive into the specified directory.

           Note that extracting a package to the root directory will <u>not</u> result in a correct installation!   Use
           <b>dpkg</b> to install packages.

           <u>directory</u>  (but  not its parents) will be created if necessary, and its permissions modified to match
           the contents of the package.

       <b>-X</b>, <b>--vextract</b> <u>archive</u> <u>directory</u>
           Is like <b>--extract</b> (<b>-x</b>) with <b>--verbose</b> (<b>-v</b>) which prints a listing of the files extracted as it goes.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--raw-extract</b> <u>archive</u> <u>directory</u>
           Extracts the filesystem tree from a package archive into  a  specified  directory,  and  the  control
           information files into a <b>DEBIAN</b> subdirectory of the specified directory (since dpkg 1.16.1).

           The target directory (but not its parents) will be created if necessary.

           The  input archive is not (currently) processed sequentially, so reading it from standard input («<b>-</b>»)
           is <b>not</b> supported.

       <b>--ctrl-tarfile</b> <u>archive</u>
           Extracts the control data from a binary package and sends it to standard output in <b>tar</b> format  (since
           dpkg  1.17.14).   Together  with  <b><a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a></b>(1) this can be used to extract a particular control file from a
           package archive.  The input archive will always be processed sequentially.

       <b>--fsys-tarfile</b> <u>archive</u>
           Extracts the filesystem tree data from a binary package and  sends  it  to  standard  output  in  <b>tar</b>
           format.   Together  with <b><a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a></b>(1) this can be used to extract a particular file from a package archive.
           The input archive will always be processed sequentially.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--control</b> <u>archive</u> [<u>directory</u>]
           Extracts the control information files from a package archive into the specified directory.

           If no directory is specified then a subdirectory <b>DEBIAN</b> in the current directory is used.

           The target directory (but not its parents) will be created if necessary.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show the usage message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--showformat=</b><u>format</u>
           This option is used to specify the format of the output <b>--show</b> will produce.  The format is a  string
           that will be output for each package listed.

           The  string may reference any status field using the “${<u>field-name</u>}” form, a list of the valid fields
           can be easily produced using <b>-I</b> on the same  package.   A  complete  explanation  of  the  formatting
           options  (including  escape  sequences  and  field  tabbing)  can  be found in the explanation of the
           <b>--showformat</b> option in <b><a href="../man1/dpkg-query.1.html">dpkg-query</a></b>(1).

           The default for this field is “${Package}\t${Version}\n”.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--compression-level=</b><u>compress-level</u>
           Specify which compression level to use on the compressor backend, when building a package (default is
           9 for gzip, 6 for xz, 19 for zstd).  building a package (default is 9 for gzip,  6  for  xz,  19  for
           zstd;  long  option since dpkg 1.22.9).  The accepted values are compressor specific.  For gzip, from
           0-9 with 0 being mapped to compressor none.  For xz from 0-9.  For zstd from 0-22, with  levels  from
           20  to  22 enabling its ultra mode.  Before dpkg 1.16.2 level 0 was equivalent to compressor none for
           all compressors.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--compression-strategy=</b><u>compress-strategy</u>
           Specify which compression strategy to use on the compressor backend, when building a  package  (since
           dpkg  1.16.2, long option since dpkg 1.22.9).  Allowed values are <b>none</b> (since dpkg 1.16.4), <b>filtered</b>,
           <b>huffman</b>, <b>rle</b> and <b>fixed</b> for gzip (since dpkg 1.17.0) and <b>extreme</b> for xz.

       <b>-Z</b>, <b>--compression=</b><u>compress-type</u>
           Specify which compression type to use when building  a  package  (long  option  since  dpkg  1.22.9).
           Allowed  values  are  <b>gzip</b>,  <b>xz</b>  (since  dpkg 1.15.6), <b>zstd</b> (since dpkg 1.21.18) and <b>none</b> (default is
           <b>zstd</b>).

       <b>--[no-]uniform-compression</b>
           Specify that the same compression parameters should be used for all archive members (i.e. <b>control.tar</b>
           and <b>data.tar</b>; since dpkg 1.17.6).  Otherwise only the <b>data.tar</b> member will use those parameters.  The
           only supported compression types allowed to be uniformly used are  <b>none</b>,  <b>gzip</b>,  <b>xz</b>  and  <b>zstd</b>.   The
           <b>--no-uniform-compression</b>   option   disables   uniform  compression  (since  dpkg  1.19.0).   Uniform
           compression is the default (since dpkg 1.19.0).

       <b>--threads-max=</b><u>threads</u>
           Sets the maximum number of threads allowed for compressors  that  support  multi-threaded  operations
           (since dpkg 1.21.9).

       <b>--root-owner-group</b>
           Set  the  owner  and  group  for each entry in the filesystem tree data to root with id 0 (since dpkg
           1.19.0).

           <b>Note</b>: This option can be useful for rootless builds (see <u>rootless-builds.txt</u>), but should <b>not</b> be used
           when the entries have an owner or group that is not root.  Support for these will be added  later  in
           the form of a meta manifest.

       <b>--deb-format=</b><u>format</u>
           Set  the  archive  format version used when building (since dpkg 1.17.0).  Allowed values are <b>2.0</b> for
           the new format, and <b>0.939000</b> for the old one (default is <b>2.0</b>).

           The old archive format is less easily parsed by non-Debian tools and is now obsolete; its only use is
           when building packages to be parsed by versions of dpkg older than 0.93.76  (September  1995),  which
           was released as i386 a.out only.

       <b>--no-check</b>
           Inhibits  <b>dpkg-deb</b>  <b>--build</b>'s usual checks on the proposed contents of an archive.  You can build any
           archive you want, no matter how broken, this way.

           Option supported since dpkg 1.22.12.

       <b>--nocheck</b>
           This is an alias for <b>--no-check</b>.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Enables verbose output (since dpkg 1.16.1).  This currently only affects <b>--extract</b> making  it  behave
           like <b>--vextract</b>.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--debug</b>
           Enables debugging output.  This is not very interesting.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>0</b>   The requested action was successfully performed.

       <b>2</b>   Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line usage, or interactions with the system, such
           as accesses to the database, memory allocations, etc.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DPKG_DEB_THREADS_MAX</b>
           Sets  the  maximum  number  of threads allowed for compressors that support multi-threaded operations
           (since dpkg 1.21.9).

           The <b>--threads-max</b> option overrides this value.

       <b>DPKG_DEB_COMPRESSOR_TYPE</b>
           Sets the compressor type to use (since dpkg 1.21.10).

           The <b>-Z</b> option overrides this value.

       <b>DPKG_DEB_COMPRESSOR_LEVEL</b>
           Sets the compressor level to use (since dpkg 1.21.10).

           The <b>-z</b> option overrides this value.

       <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently accepted values are: <b>auto</b>  (default),  <b>always</b>
           and <b>never</b>.

       <b>DPKG_NLS</b>
           If  set,  it  will  be  used  to  decide  whether  to activate Native Language Support, also known as
           internationalization (or i18n) support (since dpkg  1.22.7).   The  accepted  values  are:  <b>0</b>  and  <b>1</b>
           (default).

       <b>DPKG_PATH_PASSWD</b>
           Sets  the  pathname  for the system <u>passwd</u> file.  This path is relative to the <b>--root</b> directory.  The
           default is <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u>.

           Since dpkg 1.22.16.

       <b>DPKG_PATH_GROUP</b>
           Sets the pathname for the system <u>group</u> file.  This path is relative to  the  <b>--root</b>  directory.   The
           default is <u><a href="file:/etc/group">/etc/group</a></u>.

           Since dpkg 1.22.16.

       <b>TMPDIR</b>
           If set, <b>dpkg-deb</b> will use it as the directory in which to create temporary files and directories.

       <b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b>
           If set, it will be used as the timestamp (as seconds since the epoch) in the <b><a href="../man5/deb.5.html">deb</a></b>(5)'s <b><a href="../man5/ar.5.html">ar</a></b>(5) container
           and used to clamp the mtime in the <b><a href="../man5/tar.5.html">tar</a></b>(5) file entries.

           Since dpkg 1.18.8.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Do not attempt to use just <b>dpkg-deb</b> to install software!  You must use <b>dpkg</b> proper to ensure that all the
       files are correctly placed and the package's scripts run and its status and contents recorded.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       Examining  untrusted  package archives or extracting them into staging directories should be considered a
       security boundary, and any breakage of that boundary stemming from these operations should be  considered
       a  security  vulnerability.   But  handling untrusted package archives should not be done lightly, as the
       surface area includes any compression library supported, in addition to the archive formats  and  control
       files themselves.  Performing these operations over untrusted data as root is strongly discouraged.

       Building package archives should only be performed over trusted data.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpkg-deb</b> <b>-I</b> <u>package1</u><b>.deb</b> <u>package2</u><b>.deb</b> does the wrong thing.

       There  is no authentication on <b>.deb</b> files; in fact, there isn't even a straightforward checksum.  (Higher
       level tools like APT support authenticating <b>.deb</b> packages retrieved from a  given  repository,  and  most
       packages  nowadays provide an md5sum control file generated by debian/rules.  Though this is not directly
       supported by the lower level tools.)
