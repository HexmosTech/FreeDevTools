</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       entagged - Java Audio File Tagger

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Entagged provides a convenient way of changing the value of tag fields, either manually, or automatically
       via the freedb database.

       Entagged  can also do a lot of organization work. You can rename your files from their tag in any way you
       like, including complex directory structures. You can also tag the files from their filename, this  avoid
       copying all the information by hand.

       Best  of all, Entagged hides all the different format complexity, with one unique interface, you can work
       with mixed file formats eg. you can use freedb with a mixed album of  WMA,  MP3  and  OGG  files  without
       worrying!

</pre><h4><b>Features</b></h4><pre>
       *  Support for OGG Vorbis files - MP3 (id3v1 and id3v2 tags) files - FLAC Files - MPC(MP+) Musepack Files
       - APE Monkey Audio Files - WAV files

       * Handles all files independently of their type (allows one to batch files even from mixed types)

       * Edit essential tag information (Artist-Album-Title-TrackNb-Comment-Genre-Year) easily

       * Rename files from their tag using any of the above infos with any pattern

       * Tag files (again using the above fields) from their filename with any pattern

       * Pattern can use filename but also directory  name,  easy  to  create  a  well  structured  audio  files
       repository

       *  freedb  search  using automatically computed cddb id's (the way it is meant to be used). Simply select
       some files that represent an album, then query and tag.

       * freedb search using manually searched cddb id. When entagged can't  find  any  match,  you  can  search
       freedb for a given artist/album and find the correct match yourself, then ask entagged to tag the files.

       * Supports Multi language (currently only english,french and spanish) (contributors appreciated)

       * Recursive processing of all the above operations, easily !

       *  Text transformation: capitalize, uppercase roman numerals, lowercase, and more that can be used either
       while tagging or renaming.

       * Separate freedb and audioformats libraries that can be used independently by anyone who  want  to  read
       and/or write meta data to audio files
