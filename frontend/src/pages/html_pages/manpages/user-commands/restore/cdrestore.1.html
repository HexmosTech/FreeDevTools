</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cdrestore - Streaming restore from CD-R(W)/DVD-R(W)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       cdrestore [-qvDFRTV] [-d <u>device</u>] [-i <u>image</u>] [-l <u>size</u>]
                 [-t <u>track</u>] [-c <u>command</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       cdrestore is a utility to make streaming restores from CD-R(W)/DVD-R(W) disks. It's designed to work with
       any backup tool which is able to restore from stdin (like tar/cpio/afio).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b> <u>device</u>
              The device name which is used for reading the backup.
              (default: /dev/cdrom)

       <b>-i</b> <u>image</u>
              Enables  virtual  image mode. The backup stream is read from the given image file. You have to use
              this option, if you are restoring from a dumped image too.
              (default: none)

       <b>-l</b> <u>size</u>
              Specifies the media size. This value is used to display the free space on the media only.
              By default the given value is taken as megabytes. You can append a single letter to the number  to
              select: (k)ilobytes, (m)egabytes, (g)igabytes or (s)ectors (e.g. 170k, 4488m, 350000s).
              (default: 650m)

       <b>-t</b> <u>track</u>
              The number of the data track on the media for reading the backup.
              (default: none)

       <b>-T</b>     Enables  test  mode.  The  complete  restore  process is done to test data integrity (includes CRC
              checksum test, if available), but no data is output.
              <u>NOTE:</u> This only verifies that the data is readable by cdrestore at  all.  This  doesn't  guarantee
              that your backup software will be able to do a real restore with the data.

       <b>-F</b>     Forces cdrestore to begin the restore in the middle of a multi-disk set. This may be useful if you
              have lost a disk or a disk is badly damaged.
              <u>NOTE:</u>  This  will  most probably start the restore in the middle of a file. It's up to your backup
              software to sync to the beginning of the next file.

       <b>-R</b>     Disable the kernel readahead for the CDROM device during the restore  process.   (see  <b><a href="../man1/cdbackup.1.html">cdbackup</a></b>(1)
              Known problems)

       <b>-c</b> <u>command</u>
              The  command  which  is  executed  whenever  cdrestore needs to request a new media for multi-disk
              backups. This command (or script) should prompt the user and return  after  the  device  is  ready
              again.  The  command  receives  one argument, which is the device name passed with <b>-d</b>. This can be
              used to issue commands to the device like ejecting the media.
              (default: use internal diskchange prompt)

       <b>-q</b>     Queries the media, prints out the contents and exits.

       <b>-v</b>     Enables verbose mode.

       <b>-D</b>     Enables DEBUG output (probably not useful for normal use).

       <b>-V</b>     Prints out version information and exits.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Query the 700 MB media on /dev/sr0:

              cdrestore -d /dev/sr0 -l 700 -q

       Restore a tar archive to the current directory from track 2 of a 702 MB media on /dev/scd0:

              cdrestore -d /dev/scd0 -l 702 -t 2 | tar xf -

       Query the contents of a virtual image:

              cdrestore -i /tmp/vimage -l 4488m -q

       Check data integrity of track 3 in a virtual image after dumping it to DVD media:

              cdrestore -i /dev/dvd -t 3 -T
