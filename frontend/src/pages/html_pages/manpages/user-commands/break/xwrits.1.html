</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xwrits - reminds you to take wrist breaks

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xwrits</b> [-display <u>display</u>] [typetime=<u>time</u>] [breaktime=<u>time</u>] [other options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Xwrits</b>  reminds you to take wrist breaks for prevention or management of repetitive stress injuries. When
       you should take a break, it pops up an X window, the warning window. You click  on  the  warning  window,
       then  take  a  break.  The window changes appearance while you take the break. It changes again when your
       break is over. Then you just resume typing. Xwrits hides itself until you should take another break.

       The <b>typetime</b> option changes the amount of time between breaks,  and  the  <b>breaktime</b>  option  changes  the
       length of a break. The defaults are 55 minutes and 5 minutes, respectively.

       Xwrits's  graphics  are brightly colored pictures of a wrist and hand. The hand clenches and spreads ``as
       if in pain'' on the warning window, slumps relaxed during the break, and points  forward  valiantly  when
       the  break  is  over. It is trapped behind bars while the keyboard is locked. Other gestures are included
       (see the <b>+finger</b> option). You can also use your own pictures: see the <b>warning-picture</b>, <b>rest-picture</b>,  and
       <b>ready-picture</b> options.

       Normally, xwrits works through annoyance -- it flashes until you stop typing. However, an option makes it
       actively prevent you from typing by locking the screen. See <b>+lock</b> below.

       Xwrits  notices  when  you  leave  your  workstation idle, and treats a long idle period as if you took a
       break. You can turn this off with the <b>-idle</b> option. With the <b>+mouse</b> option, it  will  also  monitor  your
       mouse movements -- you won't be able to move the mouse during a break without aborting the break.

       Each  wrist  break  normally  lasts  the same amount of time. This is what doctors suggest, but, if you'd
       like, the <b>+quota</b> option will reward you for taking small breaks  by  reducing  the  length  of  the  next
       official break.

       Some  doctors recommend taking a short ``microbreak'' every five minutes, as well as a longer break every
       hour. To use xwrits this way, just run two xwrits processes, one for the  microbreaks  and  one  for  the
       longer breaks.

</pre><h4><b>ESCALATION</b></h4><pre>
       It  is  easy  to  put the warning window aside ``for 5 minutes'' and ignore it for fifty. The <b>after</b>=<u>delay</u>
       option causes xwrits to escalate its activity over time, making it harder to ignore.

       Options following <b>after</b> come into effect after you have ignored the warning window for  <u>delay</u>.  In  other
       words, xwrits's behavior escalates after <u>delay</u>. For instance, with this command line,
            xwrits flashtime=:2 after=10 flashtime=:.03
       the warning window will begin flashing very quickly if it is ignored for 10 minutes.

       Any  options  preceding  an  <b>after</b> option also apply following it, unless you explicitly cancel them. For
       example:
            xwrits +finger after=10 -finger

       Multiple <b>after</b> options create a series of escalations. <u>Delay</u>  arguments  are  cumulative,  so  ``after=10
       after=10'' means the same as ``after=20''.

       One  interesting  use for <b>after</b> is to make a break's length depend on how long you waited to take it. For
       example:
            xwrits break=5 after=10 break=7
       Here, a wrist break normally takes 5 minutes. However, if you ignore the warning window for 10 minutes or
       more before taking a break, the wrist break will last 7 minutes.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All options may be abbreviated to their unique prefixes. Some may be abbreviated further, in  which  case
       the smallest legal abbreviation is shown in brackets. Options are processed from left to right.

       Options  listed  as ``<b>+option</b> (<b>-option</b>)'' are toggles, which can be on or off. A + turns the option on; -
       turns it off. Off is the default for most toggle options, and only the on behavior is described. You  can
       leave off the + sign if you like: ``xwrits +finger'' and ``xwrits finger'' are equivalent. Or you can say
       ``-no-finger'' instead of ``-finger''.

       Many  options  take arguments. You can give these after an equal sign, as in ``xwrits breaktime=2''. Non-
       optional arguments can also be given separately, as in ``xwrits breaktime 2''.

       Time arguments are expressed in minutes. For example, ``2''  is  2  minutes,  ``2.5''  is  2  minutes  30
       seconds. Use a colon to specify seconds: ``2:05.4'' is 2 minutes 5.4 seconds, and ``:5'' is 5 seconds.

       <b>-display</b> <u>display</u>
            Specify the X display. Xwrits monitors this display for keystrokes and mouse movements, and displays
            windows  on  it. You can simultaneously monitor more than one display by giving this option multiple
            times; for example, ``xwrits display :0.0 display fun-orgy:0.0''.

       <b>+multiscreen</b> (<b>-multiscreen</b>)
            When this option is on, xwrits will open every available screen on each specified  <u>display</u>.   Useful
            for multihead displays.

       <b>typetime</b>=<u>time</u> [<b>t</b>]
            Allow typing for <u>time</u> between breaks. Default is 55 minutes.

       <b>breaktime</b>=<u>time</u> [<b>b</b>]
            The  amount of time a break lasts. Default is 5 minutes. This option can be supplied multiple times;
            see <b>ESCALATION</b> above.

       <b>after</b>=<u>delay-time</u>
            See <b>ESCALATION</b> above.

       <b>bars-picture</b>=<u>file</u> [<b>bp</b>=<u>file</u>]
            Sets the background GIF image that appears while the screen is locked. By default, this is an  image
            of bars designed to work with the usual <b>lock-picture</b>. If you specify your own <b>lock-picture</b>, however,
            <b>bars-picture</b> defaults to a black screen. (Say ``bars-picture="&amp;bars"'' to keep the bars.) Animations
            are not acceptable.

       <b>+beep</b> (<b>-beep</b>)
            Xwrits will beep when the break should begin and again when it is over.

       <b>+breakclock</b> (<b>-breakclock</b>) [<b>bc</b>]
            A clock will appear in the resting window showing how many minutes remain in the wrist break.

       <b>canceltime</b>=<u>time</u> [<b>ct</b>]
            Allow  typing for <u>time</u> after a break is cancelled. You cancel a break by deleting all xwrits windows
            with your window manager. This time should probably be less than the regular type time.  Default  is
            10 minutes.

       <b>+cheat</b>[=<u>num</u>] (<b>-cheat</b>)
            Allows  you  to  cheat  during a break. You can type <u>num</u> keystrokes before xwrits cancels the break.
            Default for <u>num</u> is 5. (If you're using <b>+mouse</b>, mouse movements also count as keystrokes.)

       <b>+clock</b> (<b>-clock</b>) [<b>c</b>]
            A clock will appear in the warning window showing how many minutes you've put off the wrist break.

       <b>+finger</b> (<b>-finger</b>) [<b>f</b>]
            The warning window will be rude to you.

       <b>+finger</b>=<u>culture</u>
            The warning window will be rude to you, according to <u>culture</u>'s idea of rudeness. Possible values for
            <u>culture</u> are `american' (the default), `korean' (synonyms `japanese' and `russian'), `german', or the
            name of any GIF image file.

       <b>flashtime</b>=<u>time</u>
            The amount of time between flashes of the warning window. Default is 2 seconds.

       <b>+flipoff</b> (<b>-flipoff</b>)
            Synonym for <b>+finger</b>.

       <b>+iconified</b> (<b>-iconified</b>)
            The warning window will initially appear as an icon.

       <b>+idle</b>[=<u>idletime</u>] (<b>-idle</b>) [<b>i</b>]
            If you leave your workstation idle for <u>idletime</u> or longer, xwrits will  behave  as  if  you  took  a
            break. The default for <u>idletime</u> is the break length (see <b>breaktime</b> above). <b>idle</b> is on by default.

       <b>+lock</b>[=<u>jump-time</u>] (<b>-lock</b>)
            Xwrits  will lock your screen until your break is over. You can prematurely disable the lock and get
            a normal warning window by typing  your  password  (see  <b>password</b>  below).  The  <u>jump-time</u>  argument
            specifies how fast the screensaver will move; default is 4 seconds. If the keyboard has been grabbed
            by  another  application  when  the  lock  is  attempted, the lock fails and a normal warning window
            appears instead.

       <b>lock-picture</b>=<u>file</u> [<b>lp</b>=<u>file</u>]
            Sets the GIF image that appears while the screen is locked.  Animations  are  acceptable.  See  also
            <b>bars-picture</b>.

       <b>maxhands</b>=<u>num</u>
            No  more than <u>num</u> warning windows will appear on your screen simultaneously. Normally, there will be
            only one warning window, but see <b>+multiply</b> below. <u>Num</u> cannot be less  than  1,  or  more  than  137.
            Default is 25.

       <b>minbreaktime</b>=<u>time</u>
            Sets  the  minimum break length to <u>time</u>. This option is meaningful when <b>+quota</b> is on (see below); no
            matter how many short breaks you take, the break  length  will  not  be  shortened  below  <u>time</u>.  It
            defaults to half the break time or the quota time, whichever is larger.

       <b>mono</b> (<b>-mono</b>)
            Xwrits  will display its graphics in black and white. This may be useful if you live in a world with
            a limited colormap.

       <b>+mouse</b>[=<u>sensitivity</u>] (<b>-mouse</b>)
            Xwrits will monitor your mouse movements. Every couple seconds, it  checks  whether  the  mouse  has
            moved.  Movements  of  more  than  <u>sensitivity</u> pixels in any direction are treated like key presses.
            Default for <u>sensitivity</u> is 15 pixels.

       <b>+multiply</b>[=<u>breed-time</u>] (<b>-multiply</b>) [<b>m</b>]
            A new warning window will be created every <u>breed-time</u>. Default for <u>breed-time</u> is 2.3 seconds.

       <b>+noiconify</b> (<b>-noiconify</b>)
            The warning window will not allow itself to be iconified.

       <b>+once</b>[=<u>count</u>]
            Put up the warning window once, or (with <u>count</u>) <u>count</u> times, then exit.

       <b>password</b>=<u>password</u>
            The password you type to unlock a locked screen (see <b>+lock</b> above).  Xwrits  does  not  protect  this
            password  from  intruders.  Therefore, do not use your login password or any other password you must
            keep secure. Default is ``quit''.

       <b>+quota</b>[=<u>time</u>] (<b>-quota</b>)
            If you leave your workstation idle for more than <u>time</u>, the idle time is deducted from the length  of
            your  next  break.  This  option turns the break length into a break quota -- instead of resting for
            <u>breaktime</u> consecutive minutes every <u>typetime</u>, you must rest for a total  of  <u>breaktime</u>  minutes  per
            <u>typetime</u>. Default for <u>time</u> is 1 minute. See also <b>minbreaktime</b>.

       <b>ready-picture</b>=<u>file</u> [<b>okp</b>=<u>file</u>]
            Sets the image that appears when your break is over to an arbitrary GIF.  Animations are acceptable.

       <b>rest-picture</b>=<u>file</u> [<b>rp</b>=<u>file</u>]
            Sets the image that appears during your break to an arbitrary GIF.  Animations are acceptable.

       <b>title</b>=<u>text</u>
            Xwrits windows will have <u>text</u> for their title, instead of the default ``xwrits''.

       <b>+top</b> (<b>-top</b>)
            The  warning window will try to keep itself above all other windows on the desktop. (Note: it can be
            fooled into staying only partially visible.)

       <b>+verbose</b> (<b>-verbose</b>)
            Xwrits will print a lot of information about the windows on which it is  listening  for  keystrokes.
            This is mostly useful for debugging.

       <b>version</b>
            Prints the version number and some quickie warranty information and exits.

       <b>warning-picture</b>=<u>file</u> [<b>wp</b>=<u>file</u>]
            Sets the image that appears on the warning window to an arbitrary GIF.  Animations are acceptable.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here is the way I run xwrits:
            xwrits typetime=40 finger after 15 clock multiply=5:1.4
       This looks pretty spectacular:
            xwrits t=0 b=:2 f fla=:.5 m=:.31 max=100 -i
       Whee!!

       Idea for idle processing code from <b><a href="../man1/xautolock.1.html">xautolock</a></b>(1) by Stefan De Troch and Michel Eyckmans

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Xwrits does not use the X resource database at all.

       More options might be nice. So might more careful screen locking and password protection. I would like to
       include  rude finger gestures from other cultures (see the GESTURES file in the distribution for gestures
       I know about so far).

       Please send any bugs, comments, or suggestions to me.

       Yes the misspelling is intentional.

       Yes it's my left wrist.
