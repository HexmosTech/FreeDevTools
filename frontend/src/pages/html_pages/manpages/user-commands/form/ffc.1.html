       FFC - the FEniCS Form Compiler

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ffc</b> [-h] [-V] [-S] [-v] [-s] [-e] [-l language] [-r representation] [-f option] [-O] [-q quadrature-rule]
       ... input.ufl ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Compile multilinear forms into efficient low-level code.

       The  FEniCS Form Compiler FFC accepts as input one or more files, each specifying one or more multilinear
       forms, and compiles the given forms into efficient low-level code for automatic assembly of  the  tensors
       representing  the  multilinear  forms.  In  particular,  FFC compiles a pair of bilinear and linear forms
       defining a variational problem into code that can be  used  to  efficiently  assemble  the  corresponding
       linear system.

       By  default,  FFC  generates  code  according to the UFC specification version 1.0 (Unified Form-assembly
       Code, see <a href="http://www.fenics.org/">http://www.fenics.org/</a>) but this can be controlled by specifying a  different  output  language
       (option -l). It is also possible to add new output languages to FFC.

       For  a  full  description  of  FFC,  including  a  specification  of the form language used to define the
       multilinear forms, see the FFC user manual available on the FEniCS web page: <a href="http://www.fenics.org/">http://www.fenics.org/</a>

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display help text and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display version number and exit.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--signature</b>
              Display UFC signature and exit.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Verbose mode, more output is printed. Conflicts with -s.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--silent</b>
              Silent mode, no output is printed. Conflicts with -v.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--error-control</b>
              Error control mode, a set of additional forms useful for goal-oriented error control is  generated
              and compiled.

       <b>-l</b> language, <b>--language</b> language
              Specify  output  language,  one  of 'ufc' (default) or 'dolfin' (UFC with a small layer of DOLFIN-
              specific bindings).

       <b>-r</b> representation, <b>--representation</b> representation
              Specify representation for precomputation and code generation, one of  'quadrature'  (default)  or
              'tensor'.

       <b>-f</b> option
              Specify  code  generation options. The list of options available depends on the specified language
              (format). Current  options  include  <b>-fblas</b>,  <b>-fno-foo</b>,  <b>-fprecision=n</b>,  <b>-fprecompute_basis_const</b>,
              <b>-fprecompute_ip_const</b>,   <b>-fsimplify_expressions</b>,   <b>-feliminate_zeros</b>,  <b>-fquadrature_degree=n</b>  and,
              <b>-fsplit</b>, <b>-fno_ferari</b>, described in detail below.

       <b>-f</b> blas
              Generate code that uses BLAS to compute tensor products.  This option is  currently  ignored,  but
              can be used to reduce the code size when the BLAS option is (re-)implemented in future versions.

       <b>-f</b> no-foo
              Don't  generate code for UFC function with name 'foo'. Typical options include <b>-fno-evaluate_basis</b>
              and <b>-fno-evaluate_basis_derivatives</b> to reduce the size of the generated code when these  functions
              are not needed.

       <b>-f</b> precision=n
              Set the number of significant digits to n in the generated code.  The default value of n is 15.

       <b>-f</b> precompute_basis_const
              Optimisation  option  for quadrature representation. This option is ignored if optimisation is not
              used (see <b>-O</b> option), and it also implies  the  <b>-fprecompute_ip_const</b>  <b>option</b>.  This  option  will
              generate code that precompute terms which are constant in the loops involving basis indices.  This
              can result in a reduction of the operation count and thereby improve the runtime efficiency of the
              generated  code.  However,  the  improvements  depends  on the GCC compiler options as well as the
              characteristics of the variational form.

       <b>-f</b> precompute_ip_const
              Like the <b>-fprecompute_basis_const</b> option with the only difference that code will be  generated  to
              compute terms which are constant in the loops involving the integration points only.

       <b>-f</b> simplify_expressions
              Optimisation  option  for quadrature representation. This option is ignored if optimisation is not
              used (see <b>-O</b> option). Before simplifying the expressions to compute the local element tensor, they
              are expanded in order to identify and precompute terms which are constant with respect to geometry
              and integration points. This operation can be very expensive since it involves creating  many  new
              terms which might result in memory being exhausted.

       <b>-f</b> eliminate_zeros
              Optimisation  option  for quadrature representation. This option is ignored if optimisation is not
              used (see <b>-O</b> option). Tables containing basis function values will be compressed  such  that  they
              only  contain  non  zero  values.   This  will  reduce  the  loop ranges and thereby the number of
              operations, but since a mapping is introduced, in  order  to  insert  values  correctly  into  the
              element matrix, some overhead is introduced. This optimisation option is usually most effective in
              combination with one of the other optimisation options.

       <b>-f</b> quadrature_degree=n
              Will generate a quadrature rule accurate up to degree n regardless of the polynomial degree of the
              form.  This option is only valid for UFL forms and the specified degree will apply to ALL terms of
              the given form for which no degree has been  specified  through  metadata!  As  default  FFC  will
              determine the degree automatically from the form.

       <b>-f</b> split
              Generate separate files for declarations and the implementation.

       <b>-f</b> no_ferari
              Skip  FErari  optimizations,  even  if  the  -O  flag is set. This only has effect when the tensor
              representation is used. This option can  be  used  in  combination  with  the  -O  flag  to  avoid
              potentially  very  long  compilation times by instructing FFC to only optimize when the quadrature
              representation is used.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--optimize</b>
              Generate optimized code with a lower operation  count  compared  to  non-optimized  code  for  the
              assembly  of  the  local element tensor. This will in general increase the run-time performance of
              the  code.  If  the  representation  (see  <b>-r</b>  option)  is  'tensor'  then  FFC  will  use  FErari
              optimizations.   This  option requires FErari and should be used with caution since it may be very
              costly (at compile-time) for other than simple forms.  If the representation is  'quadrature'  the
              compile-time increase tends to be much less drastic compared to FErari for very complex forms. The
              <b>-O</b> option for quadrature representation turns on the following optimisation flags:

              <b>-fsimplify_expressions</b> <b>-feliminate_zeros</b>

       <b>-o</b> directory, <b>--output-directory</b> directory
              Specify the directory where the generated files should be written to. The default output directory
              is the current ('.') directory.

       <b>-q</b> rule, <b>--quadrature-rule</b> rule
              Specify the quadrature rule that should be used when integrating the forms.  This will affect both
              tensor  and quadrature representation. Currently, available options are 'default' and 'canonical'.
              The 'default' option covers hand implemented quadrature rules for triangles and tetrahedra with  a
              degree  of  precision less than or equal to six.  The 'canonical' option relies on FIAT to compute
              the quadrature rule which is based on the Gauss--Legendre--Jacobi rule mapped onto simplices.   By
              default,  FFC  will  try  to  use  the  'default' option as this will typically result in the most
              efficient code being generated. If this is not possible (if the polynomial degree of the integrand
              is larger than six, or if  the  cell  is  not  one  of  'triangle'  or  'tetrahedron'),  FFC  will
              automatically  apply  the  'canonical'  rule.  If  the  number  of  integration points used by the
              'canonical' rule is too big for efficient computation, the option <b>-fquadrature_degree</b> can be used.
