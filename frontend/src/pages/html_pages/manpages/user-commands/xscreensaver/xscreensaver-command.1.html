</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xscreensaver-command - control a running xscreensaver process

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xscreensaver-command</b>  [--display  <u>host:display.screen</u>]  [--help  |  --quiet  |  --verbose  | --activate |
       --deactivate | --cycle | --next | --prev | --select <u>n</u> | --lock | --suspend | --exit | --restart |  --time
       | --watch | --version]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>xscreensaver-command</u> program controls a running <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver.1.html">xscreensaver</a></b>(1) daemon.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xscreensaver-command</u> accepts the following command-line options:

       <b>--help</b>  Prints a brief summary of command-line options.

       <b>--quiet</b> Only print output if an error occurs.

       <b>--verbose</b>
               Opposite of --quiet. Default.

       <b>--activate</b>
               Tell xscreensaver to turn on immediately (that is, blank the screen, as if the user had been idle
               for  long  enough.)   The  screensaver  will deactivate as soon as there is any user activity, as
               usual.

       <b>--deactivate</b>
               This tells xscreensaver to pretend that there has just been user activity.  This  means  that  if
               the screensaver is active (the screen is blanked), then this command will cause the screen to un-
               blank  as  if  there  had  been  keyboard  or  mouse activity.  If the screen is locked, then the
               password dialog will pop up first, as usual.  If the screen is not blanked, then  this  simulated
               user  activity  will re-start the countdown (so, issuing the <u>--deactivate</u> command periodically is
               <u>one</u> way to prevent the screen from blanking.)

       <b>--cycle</b> If the screensaver is active (the screen is blanked), then stop the current graphics demo and run
               a new one (chosen randomly.)

       <b>--next</b>  This is like either <u>--activate</u> or <u>--cycle</u>, depending on which is more  appropriate,  except  that
               the graphics hack that will be run is the next one in the list, instead of a randomly-chosen one.
               In  other  words,  repeatedly executing --next will cause the xscreensaver process to invoke each
               graphics demo sequentially.  (Though using the <u>--settings</u> option is probably  an  easier  way  to
               accomplish that.)

       <b>--prev</b>  This is like <u>--next</u>, but cycles in the other direction.

       <b>--select</b> <u>number</u>
               Like  <u>--activate</u>,  but  runs  the  <u>N</u>th  element  in the list of hacks.  By knowing what is in the
               <u>programs</u> list, and in what order, you can use this to activate the screensaver with a  particular
               graphics demo.  (The first element in the list is numbered 1, not 0.)

       <b>--lock</b>  Tells  the running xscreensaver process to lock the screen immediately.  This is like <u>--activate</u>,
               but forces locking as well, even if locking is not the default (that is, even  if  xscreensaver's
               <u>lock</u> resource is false, and even if the <u>lockTimeout</u> resource is non-zero.)

               Note  that  locking  doesn't  work  unless  the  <u>xscreensaver</u>  process  is  running  as you.  See
               <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver.1.html">xscreensaver</a></b>(1) for details.

       <b>--suspend</b>
               Like <u>--activate</u>, but ignores <u>lockTimeout</u> and immediately powers off  the  screen  without  fading
               out.   This is intended to be run just after your laptop's lid is closed, and just before the CPU
               halts, to lock things down quickly.

       <b>--exit</b>  Causes the xscreensaver process to  exit  gracefully.   This  does  nothing  if  the  display  is
               currently  locked.   <b>Warning:</b>  never  use <u>kill</u> <u>-9</u> with <u>xscreensaver</u>.  That can leave things in an
               inconsistent state, and you may need to log out to repair the damage.

       <b>--restart</b>
               Causes the screensaver process to exit and then restart with the same command line  arguments  as
               last  time.   You  shouldn't  really  need  to  do  this,  since  xscreensaver  notices  when the
               <u>.xscreensaver</u> file has changed and re-reads it as needed.

       <b>--time</b>  Prints the time at which the screensaver last activated or deactivated  (roughly,  how  long  the
               user  has  been  idle  or non-idle: but not quite, since it only tells you when the screen became
               blanked or un-blanked.)

       <b>--watch</b> Prints a line each time the screensaver changes state: when the screen blanks,  locks,  unblanks,
               or  when the running hack is changed.  This option never returns; it is intended for use by shell
               scripts that want to react to the screensaver in some way.  An example of its output would be:

                    BLANK Fri Nov  5 01:57:22 1999
                    RUN 34
                    RUN 79
                    RUN 16
                    LOCK Fri Nov  5 01:57:22 1999
                    RUN 76
                    RUN 12
                    UNBLANK Fri Nov  5 02:05:59 1999

               The above shows the screensaver activating, running three different hacks, then locking  (perhaps
               because the lock-timeout went off) then unblanking (because the user became active, and typed the
               correct password.)  The hack numbers are their index in the `programs' list (starting with 1, not
               0, as for the <u>--select</u> command.)

               For  example,  suppose  you want to run a program that turns down the volume on your machine when
               the screen blanks, and turns it back up when the screen un-blanks.  You could do that by  running
               a  Perl program like the following in the background.  The following program tracks the output of
               the <u>--watch</u> command and reacts accordingly:

                    #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>

                    my $blanked = 0;
                    open (my $in, "xscreensaver-command -watch |") || die;
                    while (&lt;$in&gt;) {
                      if (m/^(BLANK|LOCK)/) {
                        if (!$blanked) {
                          system ("sound-off");
                          $blanked = 1;
                        }
                      } elsif (m/^UNBLANK/) {
                        system ("sound-on");
                        $blanked = 0;
                      }
                    }

               Note that LOCK might come either with or without a preceding  BLANK  (depending  on  whether  the
               lock-timeout is non-zero), so the above program keeps track of both of them.

       <b>--version</b>
               Prints  the version of xscreensaver that is currently running on the display: that is, the actual
               version number of the running xscreensaver background process, rather than the version number  of
               xscreensaver-command.   (To see the version number of <u>xscreensaver-command</u> itself, use the <u>--help</u>
               option.)

</pre><h4><b>STOPPING</b> <b>GRAPHICS</b></h4><pre>
       If xscreensaver is running, but you want it to stop running screen hacks (e.g.,  if  you  are  logged  in
       remotely,  and  you  want  the  console  to  remain  locked but just be black, with no graphics processes
       running) you can accomplish that by simply powering down the  monitor  remotely.   In  a  minute  or  so,
       xscreensaver  will notice that the monitor is off, and will stop running screen hacks.  You can power off
       the monitor like so:

            xset dpms force off

       See the <b><a href="../man1/xset.1.html">xset</a></b>(1) manual for more info.

       You can also use <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-settings.1.html">xscreensaver-settings</a></b>(1) to make the monitor power down after a few hours, meaning  that
       xscreensaver  will  run  graphics  until it has been idle for the length of time you specified; and after
       that, the monitor will power off, and screen hacks will stop being run.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       If an error occurs while communicating with the <u>xscreensaver</u> daemon, or if the daemon reports an error, a
       diagnostic message will be printed to stderr, and <u>xscreensaver-command</u> will exit with a  non-zero  value.
       If  the  command is accepted, an indication of this will be printed to stdout, and the exit value will be
       zero.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> to get the host and display number of the screen whose saver is to be manipulated.

       <b>PATH</b>    to find the executable to restart (for the  <u>--restart</u>  command).   Note  that  this  variable  is
               consulted in the environment of the <u>xscreensaver</u> process, not the <u>xscreensaver-command</u> process.

</pre><h4><b>UPGRADES</b></h4><pre>
