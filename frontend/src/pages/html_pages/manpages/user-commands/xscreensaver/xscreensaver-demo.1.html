</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xscreensaver-demo - interactively control the background xscreensaver daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xscreensaver-demo</b> [-display <u>host:display.screen</u>] [-prefs] [--debug]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>xscreensaver-demo</u> program is a graphical front-end for setting the parameters used by the background
       <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver.1.html">xscreensaver</a></b>(1) daemon.  It is essentially two things: a tool for editing the <u><a href="file:~/.xscreensaver">~/.xscreensaver</a></u> file; and a
       tool for demoing the various graphics hacks that the <u>xscreensaver</u> daemon will launch.

       The main window consists of a menu bar and two tabbed pages.  The first page is for editing the  list  of
       demos, and the second is for editing various other parameters of the screensaver.

</pre><h4><b>MENU</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       All of these commands are on either the <b>File</b> or <b>Help</b> menus:

       <b>Blank</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>Now</b>
           Activates the background <u>xscreensaver</u> daemon, which will then run a demo at random.  This is the same
           as running <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-command.1.html">xscreensaver-command</a></b>(1) with the <u>-activate</u> option.

       <b>Lock</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>Now</b>
           Just like <b>Blank</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>Now</b>, except the screen will be locked as well (even if it is not configured to
           lock all the time.)  This is the same as running <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-command.1.html">xscreensaver-command</a></b>(1) with the <u>-lock</u> option.

       <b>Kill</b> <b>Daemon</b>
           If  the  xscreensaver  daemon  is  running  on  this  screen,  kill  it.  This is the same as running
           <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-command.1.html">xscreensaver-command</a></b>(1) with the <u>-exit</u> option.

       <b>Restart</b> <b>Daemon</b>
           If the xscreensaver daemon is running on this screen, kill it.  Then launch it again.   This  is  the
           same as doing ``<u>xscreensaver-command</u> <u>-exit</u>'' followed by ``<u>xscreensaver</u>''.

           Note that it is <u>not</u> the same as doing ``<u>xscreensaver-command</u> <u>-restart</u>''.

       <b>Exit</b>
           Exits  the  <u>xscreensaver-demo</u>  program  (this  program) without affecting the background <u>xscreensaver</u>
           daemon, if any.

       <b>About...</b>
           Displays the version number of this program, <u>xscreensaver-demo</u>.

       <b>Documentation...</b>
           Opens up a web browser looking at the XScreenSaver web page, where you can find online copies of  the
           <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver.1.html">xscreensaver</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-demo.1.html">xscreensaver-demo</a></b>(1), and <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-command.1.html">xscreensaver-command</a></b>(1) manuals.

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAY</b> <b>MODES</b> <b>TAB</b></h4><pre>
       This page contains a list of the names of the various display modes, a preview area, and some fields that
       let you configure screen saver behavior.

       <b>Mode</b>
           This option menu controls the activation behavior of the screen saver.  The options are:

           <b>Disable</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>Saver</b>
               Don't ever blank the screen, and don't ever allow the monitor to power down.

           <b>Blank</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>Only</b>
               When blanking the screen, just go black: don't run any graphics.

           <b>Only</b> <b>One</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>Saver</b>
               When  blanking  the  screen,  only  ever use one particular display mode (the one selected in the
               list.)

           <b>Random</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>Saver</b>
               When blanking the screen, select a random display mode from among  those  that  are  enabled  and
               applicable.   If there are multiple monitors connected, run a different display mode on each one.
               This is the default.

           <b>Random</b> <b>Same</b> <b>Saver</b>
               This is just like <b>Random</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>Saver</b>, except that the <u>same</u> randomly-chosen display mode will  be
               run on all monitors, instead of different ones on each.

       <b>Demo</b> <b>List</b>
           Double-clicking  in the list on the left will let you try out the indicated demo.  The screen will go
           black, and the program will run in full-screen mode, just as it would if the <u>xscreensaver</u> daemon  had
           launched it.  Clicking the mouse again will stop the demo and un-blank the screen.

           Single-clicking in the list will run it in the small preview pane on the right.  (But beware: many of
           the  display  modes  behave somewhat differently when running in full-screen mode, so the scaled-down
           view might not give an accurate impression.)

           When <b>Mode</b> is set to <b>Random</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>Saver</b>, each name in the list  has  a  checkbox  next  to  it:  this
           controls  whether  this  display  mode  is  enabled.   If it is unchecked, then that mode will not be
           chosen.  (Though you can still run it explicitly by double-clicking on its name.)

       <b>Arrow</b> <b>Buttons</b>
           Beneath the list are a pair of up and down arrows. Clicking on the down arrow will  select  the  next
           item  in the list, and then run it in full-screen mode, just as if you had double-clicked on it.  The
           up arrow goes the other way.  This is just a shortcut for trying out all  of  the  display  modes  in
           turn.

       <b>Blank</b> <b>After</b>
           After the user has been idle this long, the <u>xscreensaver</u> daemon will blank the screen.

       <b>Cycle</b> <b>After</b>
           After  the  screensaver  has  been running for this long, the currently running graphics demo will be
           killed, and a new one started.  If this is 0, then the graphics demo will never be changed: only  one
           demo will run until the screensaver is deactivated by user activity.

           The running saver will be restarted every this-many minutes even in <u>Only</u> <u>One</u> <u>Screen</u> <u>Saver</u> mode, since
           some savers tend to converge on a steady state.

       <b>Lock</b> <b>Screen</b>
           When this is checked, the screen will be locked when it activates.

       <b>Lock</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>After</b>
           This controls the length of the ``grace period'' between when the screensaver activates, and when the
           screen  becomes locked.  For example, if this is 5 minutes, and <u>Blank</u> <u>After</u> is 10 minutes, then after
           10 minutes, the screen would blank.  If there was user activity at 12 minutes, no password  would  be
           required  to  un-blank  the screen.  But, if there was user activity at 15 minutes or later (that is,
           <u>Lock</u> <u>Screen</u> <u>After</u> minutes after activation) then a password would be required.   The  default  is  0,
           meaning that if locking is enabled, then a password will be required as soon as the screen blanks.

       <b>Preview</b>
           This button, below the small preview window, runs the demo in full-screen mode so that you can try it
           out.   This  is  the same thing that happens when you double-click an element in the list.  Click the
           mouse to dismiss the full-screen preview.

       <b>Settings</b>
           This button will pop up a dialog where you can  configure  settings  specific  to  the  display  mode
           selected in the list.

</pre><h4><b>SETTINGS</b> <b>DIALOG</b></h4><pre>
       When  you  click on the <u>Settings</u> button on the <u>Display</u> <u>Modes</u> tab, a configuration dialog will pop up that
       lets you customize settings of the  selected  display  mode.   Each  display  mode  has  its  own  custom
       configuration controls on the left side.

       On  the  right  side  is  a  paragraph or two describing the display mode.  Below that is a <b>Documentation</b>
       button that will display the display mode's manual page, if it has one, in a new window  (since  each  of
       the display modes is actually a separate program, they each have their own manual.)

       The  <b>Advanced</b>  button  reconfigures  the  dialog box so that you can edit the display mode's command line
       directly, instead of using the graphical controls.

</pre><h4><b>ADVANCED</b> <b>TAB</b></h4><pre>
       This tab lets you change various settings used by the xscreensaver daemon itself, as well as some  global
       options shared by all of the display modes.

       <b>Image</b> <b>Manipulation</b>

       Some  of  the  graphics  hacks  manipulate images.  These settings control where those source images come
       from.  (All of these options work  by  invoking  the  <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-getimage.1.html">xscreensaver-getimage</a></b>(1)  program,  which  is  what
       actually does the work.)

           <b>Grab</b> <b>Desktop</b> <b>Images</b>
               If  this  option  is  selected, then they are allowed to manipulate the desktop image, that is, a
               display mode might draw a picture of your desktop melting, or being distorted in some  way.   The
               security-paranoid  might  want  to  disable  this option, because if it is set, it means that the
               windows on your desktop will occasionally be visible while your screen is  locked.   Others  will
               not be able to <u>do</u> anything, but they may be able to <u>see</u> whatever you left on your screen.

           <b>Grab</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Frames</b>
               If  your system has a video capture card, selecting this option will allow the image-manipulating
               modes to capture a frame of video to operate on.

           <b>Choose</b> <b>Random</b> <b>Image</b>
               If this option is set, then the image-manipulating modes will  select  a  random  image  file  to
               operate  on,  from  the  specified  source.   That source may be a local directory, which will be
               recursively searched for images.  Or, it may be the URL of an RSS or Atom feed  (e.g.,  a  Flickr
               gallery),  in which case a random image from that feed will be selected instead.  The contents of
               the feed will be cached locally and refreshed periodically as needed.

           If more than one of the above image-related options are selected, then one will be chosen at  random.
           If none of them are selected, then an image of video colorbars will be used instead.

       <b>Text</b> <b>Manipulation</b>

       Some  of  the  display modes display and manipulate text.  The following options control how that text is
       generated.  (These parameters control the behavior of the <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver-text.1.html">xscreensaver-text</a></b>(1)  program,  which  is  what
       actually does the work.)

           <b>Host</b> <b>Name</b> <b>and</b> <b>Time</b>
               If  this  checkbox  is  selected,  then the text used by the screen savers will be the local host
               name, OS version, date, time, and system load.

           <b>Text</b>
               If this checkbox is selected, then the literal text typed in the field to its right will be used.
               If it contains % escape sequences, they will be expanded as per <b><a href="../man2/strftime.2.html">strftime</a></b>(2).

           <b>Text</b> <b>File</b>
               If this checkbox is selected, then the contents of the corresponding file will be displayed.

           <b>Program</b>
               If this checkbox is selected, then the given program will be run, repeatedly, and its output will
               be displayed.

           <b>URL</b> If this checkbox is  selected,  then  the  given  HTTP  URL  will  be  downloaded  and  displayed
               repeatedly.   If  the  document  contains  HTML, RSS, or Atom, it will be converted to plain-text
               first.

               Note: this re-downloads the document every time the screen saver runs out of  text,  so  it  will
               probably  be  hitting that web server multiple times a minute.  Be careful that the owner of that
               server doesn't consider that to be abusive.

       <b>Power</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Settings</b>

       These settings control whether, and when, your monitor powers down.

           <b>Power</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Enabled</b>
               Whether the monitor should be powered down after a period of inactivity.

               If this option is grayed out, it means your X server does not support the XDPMS extension, and so
               control over the monitor's power state is not available.

               If you're using a laptop, don't be surprised if this has no effect:  many  laptops  have  monitor
               power-saving  behavior  built  in  at  a very low level that is invisible to Unix and X.  On such
               systems, you can typically only adjust the power-saving delays by changing settings in  the  BIOS
               in some hardware-specific way.

           <b>Standby</b> <b>After</b>
               If  <u>Power</u>  <u>Management</u>  <u>Enabled</u>  is selected, the monitor will go black after this much idle time.
               (Graphics demos will stop running, also.)

           <b>Suspend</b> <b>After</b>
               If <u>Power</u> <u>Management</u> <u>Enabled</u> is selected, the monitor will go into power-saving  mode  after  this
               much idle time.  This duration should be greater than or equal to <u>Standby</u>.

           <b>Off</b> <b>After</b>
               If  <u>Power</u>  <u>Management</u> <u>Enabled</u> is selected, the monitor will fully power down after this much idle
               time.  This duration should be greater than or equal to <u>Suspend</u>.

           <b>Quick</b> <b>Power-off</b> <b>in</b> <b>Blank</b> <b>Only</b> <b>Mode</b>
               If the display mode is set to <u>Blank</u> <u>Screen</u> <u>Only</u> and this is checked, then  the  monitor  will  be
               powered  off  immediately  upon  blanking, regardless of the other power-management settings.  In
               this way, the power management idle-timers can be completely disabled, but  the  screen  will  be
               powered off when black.  (This might be preferable on laptops.)

       <b>Fading</b> <b>and</b> <b>Colormaps</b>

       These options control how the screen fades to or from black when a screen saver begins or ends.

           <b>Fade</b> <b>To</b> <b>Black</b> <b>When</b> <b>Blanking</b>
               If selected, then when the screensaver activates, the current contents of the screen will fade to
               black  instead of simply winking out.  (Note: this doesn't work with all X servers.)  A fade will
               also be done when switching graphics hacks (when the <u>Cycle</u> <u>After</u> expires.)

           <b>Unfade</b> <b>From</b> <b>Black</b> <b>When</b> <b>Unblanking</b>
               The complement to <u>Fade</u> <u>Colormap</u>: if selected, then when the screensaver deactivates, the original
               contents of the screen will fade in from black instead of appearing immediately.   This  is  only
               done if <u>Fade</u> <u>Colormap</u> is also selected.

           <b>Fade</b> <b>Duration</b>
               When fading or unfading are selected, this controls how long the fade will take.

           <b>Install</b> <b>Colormap</b>
               On  8-bit screens, whether to install a private colormap while the screensaver is active, so that
               the graphics hacks can get as many colors as possible.  This does nothing if you are  running  in
               16-bit or better.

       There  are  more settings than these available, but these are the most commonly used ones; see the manual
       for <b><a href="../man1/xscreensaver.1.html">xscreensaver</a></b>(1) for other parameters that can be set by editing the <u><a href="file:~/.xscreensaver">~/.xscreensaver</a></u> file,  or  the  X
       resource database.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xscreensaver-demo</u> accepts the following command line options.

       <b>-display</b> <u>host:display.screen</u>
               The  X  display  to use.  The <u>xscreensaver-demo</u> program will open its window on that display, and
               also control the <u>xscreensaver</u> daemon that is managing that same display.

       <b>-prefs</b>  Start up with the <b>Advanced</b> tab selected by default instead of the <b>Display</b> <b>Modes</b> tab.

       <b>-debug</b>  Causes lots of diagnostics to be printed on stderr.

       It is important that the <u>xscreensaver</u> and <u>xscreensaver-demo</u> processes be running on the same machine,  or
       at  least,  on two machines that share a file system.  When <u>xscreensaver-demo</u> writes a new version of the
       <u><a href="file:~/.xscreensaver">~/.xscreensaver</a></u> file, it's important that the <u>xscreensaver</u> see that same file.  If the two processes  are
       seeing different <u><a href="file:~/.xscreensaver">~/.xscreensaver</a></u> files, things will malfunction.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> to get the default host and display number.

       <b>PATH</b>    to  find  the  sub-programs to run.  However, note that the sub-programs are actually launched by
               the <u>xscreensaver</u> daemon, not by <u>xscreensaver-demo</u> itself.  So, what matters is  what  <b>$PATH</b>  that
               the <u>xscreensaver</u> program sees.

       <b>HOME</b>    for the directory in which to read and write the <u>.xscreensaver</u> file.

       <b>XENVIRONMENT</b>
               to  get  the  name  of  a  resource  file  that  overrides  the  global  resources  stored in the
               RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

       <b>HTTP_PROXY</b> or <b>http_proxy</b>
               to get the default HTTP proxy host and port.
