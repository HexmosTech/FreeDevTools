       wmacpi - Battery status monitor for systems supporting ACPI

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wmacpi-cli - Query battery status for systems supporting ACPI

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wmacpi</b>  [ -c value ] [ -d display ] [ -m battery no ] [ -s sample rate ] [ -f ] [ -v ] [ -n ] [ -x ] [ -a
       samples ] [ -v ] [ -h ]

       <b>wmacpi-cli</b> [ -a samples ] [ -V ] [ -v ] ] -b ] [ -r ] [ -h ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>wmacpi</b> command.

       <b>wmacpi</b> is a program that displays the current battery status in a WindowMaker dock app, on  systems  that
       support Intel's Advanced Configuration and Power Interface specification (ACPI).

       The  program  monitors a battery, displaying its current percentage charge via a bar and a numeric value.
       It also displays the current power status for the system, the time remaining  (calculated  based  on  the
       remaining  battery  capacity  and  the  current  rate  of power usage), and a scrolling message with some
       hopefully useful information.

       Clicking on the window cycles through the batteries that the ACPI system knows about.

       <b>wmacpi-cli</b> queries the battery status from the command line. It prints the power status,  the  percentage
       remaining  for  each  battery  found,  and  the  time  remaining if the system is on battery, or the time
       remaining for each battery to reach full charge if the batteries are charging.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wmacpi</b>

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--critical=percentage</b>
              Set critical low alarm at &lt;percentage&gt;% (default: 10%).

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--display=display</b>
              Set the X display to open the window on.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--battery=battery</b> <b>number</b>
              Set the battery to monitor initially.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--sample-rate=sample</b> <b>rate</b>
              Set the rate at which to sample the ACPI data, in number of times per minute.  Minimum  is  1,  ie
              once a minute, default is 20, maximum is 600.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--no-blink</b>
              Disable blinking power glyph when charging. Note that it still blinks when the battery reports its
              capacity state as critical.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--force-capacity-mode</b>
              Force  the  use  of  capacity  mode for calculating time remaining. By default <b>wmacpi</b> will use the
              reported values of remaining capacity and present rate to calculate the time remaining on battery.
              This flag will force the use of the remaining capacity and time samples to calculate  the  present
              rate  of  drain,  and  from there the time remaining. Note that this mode of calculation generally
              underreports the time remaining. This mode works around certain buggy ACPI  BIOSes  that  fail  to
              report the current rate.

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--cmdline</b>
              Run wmacpi in command line mode - this operates identically to <b>wmacpi-cli.</b>

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--samples=samples</b>
              Average  the  time  remaining over num samples. This greatly improves the accuracy of the reported
              time remaining.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--verbosity=num</b>
              Increase the verbosity of the program. Setting this to 1 will print  extra  error  information;  2
              will produce informational output; 3 will produce copious debugging output.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print the version information.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--no-scroll</b>
              Disable scrolling message.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display help.

       <b>wmacpi-cli</b>

       <b>-a</b> <b>num</b> Average  the  time  remaining over num samples. This greatly improves the accuracy of the reported
              time remaining.

       <b>-V</b>     Increase the verbosity of the program. If repeated, the result is the same as setting  <b>--verbosity</b>
              for <b>wmacpi</b> to the number of repetitions.

       <b>-v</b>     Print the version information.

       <b>-h</b>     Display help.
