</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wmbattery - dockable battery monitor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wmbattery</b> [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wmbattery</b> is a battery monitor.  It is used to visually display the system's battery status.

       <b>wmbattery</b>  can  get battery information using upower, HAL, APM, ACPI, or the SPIC controller in some Sony
       laptops.  <b>wmbattery</b> is dockable using WindowMaker and  AfterStep  window  managers;  under  other  window
       managers <b>wmbattery</b> appears as a nicely-sized 64x64 application.

       <b>wmbattery</b>  displays  the status of your laptop's battery in a small icon.  This includes if it is plugged
       in, if the battery is charging, how many minutes of battery life remain,  battery  life  remaining  (with
       both a percentage and a graph), and battery status (high - green, low - yellow, or critical - red).

</pre><h4><b>ELEMENTS</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>DISPLAY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>wmbattery</b> display consists of these elements:

       <b>dial</b>   The large dial at the top of the display shows battery life remaining.

       <b>time</b> <b>display</b>
              The  time  display, right under and in the middle of the dial, shows how many hours and minutes of
              battery life is estimated to remain at the current rate of use.

              If ACPI is used and battery is charging, the time display will instead show a countdown  (starting
              with  a  minus  sign)  of  how many hours and minutes it is estimated to take until the battery is
              fully charged.

       <b>power</b> <b>cord</b>
              The small icon of a power cord plug, in the bottom left, tells if the laptop is plugged into  wall
              power. If so, it will be lit.

       <b>charging</b> <b>indicator</b>
              The lightning bolt icon, to the right of the plug, tells if the battery is being charged. If so it
              will be lit and will connect the plug to the battery.

       <b>battery</b> <b>icon</b>
              The  battery icon, to the right of the lighting bolt, shows the percentage of battery time. If the
              battery is removed the icon will be dimmed. If the computer is low on power the battery will  turn
              yellow;  if  the  computer is critically low on power and about to die because of it, it will turn
              red.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Display list of command-line options.

       <b>-w</b> <b>secs</b>
              Pause this many seconds between updates.

       <b>-d</b> <b>display</b>
              Use the designated X display.

       <b>-g</b> <b>{+-}x{+-}y</b>
              Specify geometry. This specifies position, not size.

       <b>-b</b> <b>battnum</b>
              Display the given battery. Only of use with the HAL or ACPI interfaces on systems with  more  than
              one battery. The default is to display the first battery found.

       <b>-l</b> <b>percent</b>
              Set  the  percentage  at  which  the  battery  is  considered  to be running low. By default, this
              percentage is determined automatically, and you shouldn't need to set it. If  you  set  this,  you
              should probably also set the -c switch.

       <b>-c</b> <b>percent</b>
              Set  the  percentage  at  which  the battery is considered to be critically low.  By default, this
              percentage is determined automatically, and you shouldn't need to set it. If  you  set  this,  you
              should probably also set the -l switch.

       <b>-e</b>     wmbattery contains code for estimating the time remaining before discharge, and until full charge,
              and  this  code  is  used  if  no  other source of this informaton is available. This switch makes
              wmbattery use its time estimation code even if some other estimate is available.

       <b>-s</b> <b>granularity</b>
              Ignore fluctuations less than the specified granularity percent when estimating time. (Implies -e)

       <b>-a</b> <b>file.au</b>
              Play the specified au file (by sending it to /dev/audio) when the battery is low.

       <b>-x</b> <b>command</b>
              Execute the specified command when the battery is below critical. The strings <u>%percent%</u>, <u>%minutes%</u>
              and <u>%seconds%</u> will be translated into the appropriate values.

       <b>-i</b>     Display as icon.

       <b>-n</b>     Disable dial graphic.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Start at 10% battery to execute 'echo' including status information:
              wmbattery -c 10 -x "echo Status: %percent%% - %minutes% minutes, %seconds% seconds left"
