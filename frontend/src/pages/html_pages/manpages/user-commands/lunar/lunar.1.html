       lunar - a calendar conversion utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lunar</b> [<b>-usthg5b</b>]
       <b>lunar</b> [<b>-usthg5b</b>] <u>year</u> <u>month</u> <u>day</u> [<u>hour</u>]
       <b>lunar</b> [<b>-usthg5b</b>] <b>-i</b> [<b>-l</b>] <u>year</u> <u>month</u> <u>day</u> [<u>hour</u>]
       <b>lunar</b> <b>--help</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>lunar</u>  program  performs  date  conversion between the Gregorian Solar Calendar (SC) and the Chinese
       Lunar Calendar (LC).  Given a date in either calendar, the program also outputs the corresponding "<u>sheng‚Äê</u>
       <u>xiao</u>" (animal of the year) and "<u>ganzhi</u>" characters.  The date range currently covered is from about  1900
       A.D. to 2049 A.D.

       For  the  sake of convenience, we choose the convention such that the solar and lunar year numbers of the
       first day of a lunar year are the same.  For example, SC 1991.2.15 is LC 1991.1.1, while SC 1991.2.14  is
       LC 1990.12.30.  Moreover, we choose the convention such that the solar and lunar hour numbers (in 24-hour
       clock)  of  a  date are the same, although a lunar day starts at 23:00 of a solar day. This means that SC
       1991.2.15.23 is LC 1991.1.2.23, while  SC  1991.2.16.0  is  LC  1991.1.2.0,  and  SC  1991.2.16.1  is  LC
       1991.1.2.1.

       The standard time of the Lunar Calendar is Beijing (Hong Kong) Standard Time, not GMT.  Be sure to adjust
       appropriately for other time zones and "Daylight Saving Time".

       In  the  Lunar Calendar, a normal year has 12 months, and a leap year (run-nian) has 13 months, where the
       extra month is called a "leap month" (run-yue).  For example, the leap month that follows immediately the
       6-th lunar month is called the 6-th leap month.  A (leap) month is either a short or long one, which  has
       29 or 30 days respectively.

       There  are  10  <u>gan</u>'s  and 12 <u>zhi</u>'s.  The <u>ganzhi</u> labeling of the year, month, day and hour of a date is a
       member of the Cartesian product GxGxGxG, where G = {1,2,...,60}.  For example, "<u>jia-zi</u>" is  1,  "<u>yi-chou</u>"
       is 2, and so on.  The <u>ganzhi</u> of the j-th leap month is the same as that of the j-th month.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Since <u>lunar</u> was first packaged for Debian in 2002, the Debian package maintainer has made minor additions
       such  as  Big5  and  UTF-8  support.  More recently, <u>lunar</u> gained the ability to detect system locale and
       choose the correct character set.

       <u>Lunar</u> now also detects and displays the current China Standard Time by default, so that  the  <u>year</u>  <u>month</u>
       <u>day</u> [<u>hour</u>] parameters are now optional for solar-to-lunar calendar conversion.

       The possible options are

       <b>-b</b>     output <u>ganzhi</u> in special "bitmap" characters.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--utf8</b>
              output <u>hanzi</u> or Chinese characters encoded in UTF-8.

       <b>-s</b>     output simplified Chinese (for UTF-8 only).

       <b>-t</b>     output traditional Chinese (for UTF-8 only).

       <b>-g</b>, <b>-h</b>, <b>--gb</b>
              output <u>hanzi</u> or Chinese characters encoded in (highest-bit-set) GB code.

       <b>-5</b>, <b>--big5</b>
              output <u>hanzi</u> or Chinese characters encoded in Big5.

       <b>-i</b>     convert a lunar date to solar date.  The default is to convert a solar date to a lunar date.

       <b>-l</b>     indicate  the month is a lunar leap month.  This option is meaningful only when the "-i" option is
              used.
