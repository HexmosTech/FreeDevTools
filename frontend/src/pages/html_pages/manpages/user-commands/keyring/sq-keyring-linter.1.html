</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sequoia-keyring-linter - A linter for keyrings

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sequoia-keyring-linter</b>  [<b>-t</b>|<b>--time</b>]  [<b>-q</b>|<b>--quiet</b>]  [<b>-f</b>|<b>--fix</b>]  [<b>-e</b>|<b>--export-secret-keys</b>]  [<b>-p</b>|<b>--password</b>]
       [<b>-k</b>|<b>--list-keys</b>] [<b>-h</b>|<b>--help</b>] [<b>-V</b>|<b>--version</b>] [<u>FILE</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A linter for keyrings

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-t</b>, <b>--time</b>=<u>TIME</u>
              Sets the reference time to TIME.

              TIME is interpreted as an ISO 8601 timestamp. To set the  reference  time  to  July  21,  2013  at
              midnight UTC, you can do:

              $ sq-keyring-linter --time 20130721 ...

              To include a time, add a T, the time and optionally the timezone (the default timezone is UTC):

              $ sq-keyring-linter --time 20130721T0550+0200 ...

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>=<u>QUIET</u>
              Quiet; does not output any diagnostics

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--fix</b>=<u>FIX</u>
              Attempts to fix certificates, when possible

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--export-secret-keys</b>=<u>EXPORT_SECRET_KEYS</u>
              When  fixing  a  certificate,  the  fixed certificate is exported without any secret key material.
              Using this switch causes any secret key material to also be exported.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--password</b>=<u>PASSWORD</u>
              A key's password. Normally this is not needed: if stdin is connected to a tty, the linter will ask
              for a password when needed.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--list-keys</b>=<u>LIST_KEYS</u>
              If set, outputs a list of fingerprints, one per line,  of  certificates  that  have  issues.  This
              output is intended for use by scripts.

              This  option  implies  "--quiet".  If  you  also  specify "--fix", errors will still be printed to
              stderr, and fixed certificates will still be emitted to stdout.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print help information (use `-h` for a summary)

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print version information

       [<u>FILE</u>] A list of OpenPGP keyrings to process. If none are specified, a keyring is read from stdin.

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b></h4><pre>
       `sq-keyring-linter` checks the supplied certificates for the following SHA-1-related issues:

         - Whether a certificate revocation uses SHA-1.

         - Whether the current self signature for a non-revoked User ID uses
           SHA-1.

         - Whether the current subkey binding signature for a non-revoked,
           live subkey uses SHA-1.

         - Whether a primary key binding signature ("backsig") for a
           non-revoked, live subkey uses SHA-1.

       Diagnostics are printed to stderr.  At the end, some statistics are shown.  This is useful when examining
       a keyring.  If `--fix` is specified and at least one issue could be fixed,  the  fixed  certificates  are
       printed to stdout.

       This  tool  does  not  currently support smart cards.  But, if only the subkeys are on a smart card, this
       tool may still be able to partially repair the certificate.  In particular, it will be able  to  fix  any
       issues  with User ID self signatures and subkey binding signatures for encryption-capable subkeys, but it
       will not be able to generate new primary key binding signatures for any signing-capable subkeys.

       EXIT STATUS:

       If `--fix` is not specified:
         2  if any issues were found,
         1  if not issues were found, but there were errors reading the input,
         0  if there were no issues.

       If `--fix` is specified:
         3  if any issues could not be fixed,
         1  if not issues were found, but there were errors reading the input,
         0  if all issues were fixed or there were no issues.

       EXAMPLES:

         # To gather statistics, simply run:
         $ sq-keyring-linter keyring.pgp

         # To fix a key:
         $ gpg --export-secret-keys FPR | sq-keyring-linter --fix -p passw0rd -p password123 | gpg --import

         # To get a list of keys with issues:
         $ sq-keyring-linter --list-keys keyring.pgp | while read FPR; do something; done
