       pdb_segxchain - manual page for pdb_segxchain 2.5.1

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pdb_segxchain File not found or not readable: '--help'

       Swaps the chain identifier by the segment identifier.

       If  the  segment  identifier  is  longer than one character, the script will truncate it. Does not ensure
       unique chain IDs.

   <b>Usage:</b>
              python pdb_segxchain.py &lt;pdb file&gt;

   <b>Example:</b>
              python pdb_segxchain.py 1CTF.pdb

       This program is part of the `pdb-tools` suite of utilities and should not be distributed isolatedly.  The
       `pdb-tools`  were  created  to  quickly  manipulate  PDB  files  using  the  terminal,  and  can  be used
       sequentially, with one tool streaming data to another. They are based on  old  FORTRAN77  code  that  was
       taking too much effort to maintain and compile. RIP.
