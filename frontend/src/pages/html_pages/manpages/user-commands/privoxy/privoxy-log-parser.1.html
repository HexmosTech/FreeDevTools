</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       privoxy-log-parser - A parser and syntax-highlighter for Privoxy log messages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>privoxy-log-parser</b> [<b>--detect-inactivity</b>] [<b>--inactivity-threshold</b> <b>msecs</b>] [<b>--html-output</b>] [<b>--no-msecs</b>]
       [<b>--no-syntax-higlighting</b>] [<b>--statistics</b>] [<b>--shorten-thread-ids</b>] [<b>--show-ineffective-filters</b>]
       [<b>--url-statistics-threshold</b>] [<b>--version</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>privoxy-log-parser</b> reads Privoxy log messages and

       - syntax-highlights recognized lines,

       - reformats some of them for easier comprehension,

       - filters out less useful messages, and

       - (in some cases) calculates additional information,
         like the compression ratio or how a filter affected
         the content size.

       With <b>privoxy-log-parser</b> you should be able to increase Privoxy's log level without getting confused by
       the resulting amount of output. For example for "debug 64" <b>privoxy-log-parser</b> will (by default) only show
       messages that affect the content. If a filter doesn't cause any hits, <b>privoxy-log-parser</b> will hide the
       "filter foo caused 0 hits" message.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       [<b>--detect-inactivity</b>] Instead of syntax highlighting, detect periods of log inactivity of more than the
       amount of milliseconds specified with the <b>--inactivity-threshold</b> option. Mainly useful for debugging.

       [<b>--host-statistics-threshold</b>] Only show the request count for a host if it's above or equal to the given
       threshold. If the threshold is 0, host statistics are disabled.

       [<b>--html-output</b>] Use HTML and CSS when syntax highlighting. If this option is omitted, ANSI escape
       sequences are used unless <b>--no-syntax-highlighting</b> is active.  This option is only intended to make
       embedding log excerpts in web pages easier.  It does not escape any input!

       [<b>--inactivity-threshold</b> <b>msecs</b>] Specifies the number of milliseconds between log messages to consider
       inactivity when running in [<b>--detect-inactivity</b>] mode.

       [<b>--keep-date</b>] Don't remove the date when printing highlighted log messages.  Useful when parsing multiple
       log files at once.

       [<b>--no-msecs</b>] Don't expect millisecond resolution

       [<b>--no-syntax-highlighting</b>] Disable syntax-highlighting. Useful when the filtered output is piped into
       less in which case the ANSI control codes don't work, or if the terminal itself doesn't support the
       control codes.

       [<b>--passed-request-statistics-threshold</b>] Only show the request count for a passed requests if it's above
       or equal to the given threshold. If the threshold is 0, passed request statistics are disabled.

       [<b>--shorten-thread-ids</b>] Shorten the thread ids to a three-digit decimal number.  Note that the mapping
       from thread ids to shortened ids is created at run-time and thus varies with the input.

       [<b>--show-ineffective-filters</b>] Don't suppress log lines for filters that didn't modify the content.

       [<b>--show-complete-request-distribution</b>] Show the complete client request distribution in the <b>--statistics</b>
       output. Without this option only the ten most common numbers are shown.

       [<b>--statistics</b>] Gather various statistics instead of syntax highlighting log messages. This is an
       experimental feature, if the results look wrong they very well might be. Also note that the results are
       pretty much guaranteed to be incorrect if Privoxy and Privoxy-Log-Parser aren't in sync.

       [<b>--strict-checks</b>] When generating statistics, look more careful at the input data and abort if it is
       unexpected, even if it doesn't affect the results. Significantly slows the parsing down and is not
       expected to catch any problems that matter.  When highlighting, print warnings in case of unknown
       messages which can't be properly highlighted.

       [<b>--unbreak-lines-only</b>] Tries to fix lines that got messed up by a broken or interestingly configured mail
       client and thus are no longer recognized properly.  Only fixes some breakage, but may be good enough or
       at least better than nothing.  Doesn't do anything else, so you probably want to pipe the output into
       <b>privoxy-log-parser</b> again.

       [<b>--url-statistics-threshold</b>] Only show the request count for a resource if it's above or equal to the
       given threshold. If the threshold is 0, URL statistics are disabled.

       [<b>--version</b>] Print version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To monitor a log file:

       tail -F /usr/jails/privoxy-jail/var/log/privoxy/privoxy.log | <b>privoxy-log-parser</b>

       Replace '-F' with '-f' if your tail implementation lacks '-F' support or if the log won't get rotated
       anyway. The log file location depends on your system (Doh!).

       To monitor Privoxy without having it write to a log file:

       privoxy --no-daemon /usr/jails/privoxy-jail/usr/local/etc/privoxy/config 2&gt;&amp;1 | <b>privoxy-log-parser</b>

       Again, the config file location depends on your system. Output redirection depends on your shell, the
       above works with bourne shells.

       To read a processed Privoxy log file from top to bottom, letting the content scroll by slightly faster
       than you can read:

       <b>privoxy-log-parser</b> &lt; /usr/jails/privoxy-jail/var/log/privoxy/privoxy.log

       This is probably only useful to fill screens in the background of haxor movies.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Syntax highlighting with ANSI escape sequences will look strange if your background color isn't black.

       Some messages aren't recognized yet and will not be fully highlighted.

       <b>privoxy-log-parser</b> is developed with Privoxy 3.0.7 or later in mind, using earlier Privoxy versions will
       probably result in an increased amount of unrecognized log lines.

       Privoxy's log files tend to be rather large. If you use HTML highlighting some browsers can't handle
       them, get confused and will eventually crash because of segmentation faults or unexpected exceptions.
       This is a problem in the browser and not <b>privoxy-log-parser</b>'s fault.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Many settings can't be controlled through command line options yet.
