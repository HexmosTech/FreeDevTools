</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Use <b>git</b> <b>stash</b> when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want
       to go back to a clean working directory. The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the
       working directory to match the <b>HEAD</b> commit.

       The modifications stashed away by this command can be listed with <b>git</b> <b>stash</b> <b>list</b>, inspected with <b>git</b>
       <b>stash</b> <b>show</b>, and restored (potentially on top of a different commit) with <b>git</b> <b>stash</b> <b>apply</b>. Calling <b>git</b>
       <b>stash</b> without any arguments is equivalent to <b>git</b> <b>stash</b> <b>push</b>. A stash is by default listed as "WIP on
       <u>branchname</u> ...", but you can give a more descriptive message on the command line when you create one.

       The latest stash you created is stored in <b>refs/stash</b>; older stashes are found in the reflog of this
       reference and can be named using the usual reflog syntax (e.g. <b>stash@</b>{0} is the most recently created
       stash, <b>stash@</b>{1} is the one before it, <b>stash@</b>{2.hours.ago} is also possible). Stashes may also be
       referenced by specifying just the stash index (e.g. the integer <b>n</b> is equivalent to <b>stash@</b>{n}).

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       push [-p|--patch] [-S|--staged] [-k|--[no-]keep-index] [-u|--include-untracked] [-a|--all] [-q|--quiet]
       [(-m|--message) &lt;message&gt;] [--pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt; [--pathspec-file-nul]] [--] [&lt;pathspec&gt;...]
           Save your local modifications to a new <u>stash</u> <u>entry</u> and roll them back to HEAD (in the working tree
           and in the index). The &lt;message&gt; part is optional and gives the description along with the stashed
           state.

           For quickly making a snapshot, you can omit "push". In this mode, non-option arguments are not
           allowed to prevent a misspelled subcommand from making an unwanted stash entry. The two exceptions to
           this are <b>stash</b> <b>-p</b> which acts as alias for <b>stash</b> <b>push</b> <b>-p</b> and pathspec elements, which are allowed
           after a double hyphen <b>--</b> for disambiguation.

       save [-p|--patch] [-S|--staged] [-k|--[no-]keep-index] [-u|--include-untracked] [-a|--all] [-q|--quiet]
       [&lt;message&gt;]
           This option is deprecated in favour of <u>git</u> <u>stash</u> <u>push</u>. It differs from "stash push" in that it cannot
           take pathspec. Instead, all non-option arguments are concatenated to form the stash message.

       list [&lt;log-options&gt;]
           List the stash entries that you currently have. Each <u>stash</u> <u>entry</u> is listed with its name (e.g.
           <b>stash@</b>{0} is the latest entry, <b>stash@</b>{1} is the one before, etc.), the name of the branch that was
           current when the entry was made, and a short description of the commit the entry was based on.

               stash@{0}: WIP on submit: 6ebd0e2... Update git-stash documentation
               stash@{1}: On master: 9cc0589... Add git-stash

           The command takes options applicable to the <u>git</u> <u>log</u> command to control what is shown and how. See
           <b><a href="../man1/git-log.1.html">git-log</a></b>(1).

       show [-u|--include-untracked|--only-untracked] [&lt;diff-options&gt;] [&lt;stash&gt;]
           Show the changes recorded in the stash entry as a diff between the stashed contents and the commit
           back when the stash entry was first created. By default, the command shows the diffstat, but it will
           accept any format known to <u>git</u> <u>diff</u> (e.g., <b>git</b> <b>stash</b> <b>show</b> <b>-p</b> <b>stash@</b>{1} to view the second most recent
           entry in patch form). If no <u>&lt;diff-option&gt;</u> is provided, the default behavior will be given by the
           <b>stash.showStat</b>, and <b>stash.showPatch</b> config variables. You can also use <b>stash.showIncludeUntracked</b> to
           set whether <b>--include-untracked</b> is enabled by default.

       pop [--index] [-q|--quiet] [&lt;stash&gt;]
           Remove a single stashed state from the stash list and apply it on top of the current working tree
           state, i.e., do the inverse operation of <b>git</b> <b>stash</b> <b>push</b>. The working directory must match the index.

           Applying the state can fail with conflicts; in this case, it is not removed from the stash list. You
           need to resolve the conflicts by hand and call <b>git</b> <b>stash</b> <b>drop</b> manually afterwards.

       apply [--index] [-q|--quiet] [&lt;stash&gt;]
           Like <b>pop</b>, but do not remove the state from the stash list. Unlike <b>pop</b>, <u>&lt;stash&gt;</u> may be any commit that
           looks like a commit created by <b>stash</b> <b>push</b> or <b>stash</b> <b>create</b>.

       branch &lt;branchname&gt; [&lt;stash&gt;]
           Creates and checks out a new branch named <u>&lt;branchname&gt;</u> starting from the commit at which the <u>&lt;stash&gt;</u>
           was originally created, applies the changes recorded in <u>&lt;stash&gt;</u> to the new working tree and index. If
           that succeeds, and <u>&lt;stash&gt;</u> is a reference of the form <b>stash@</b>{<u>&lt;revision&gt;</u>}, it then drops the <u>&lt;stash&gt;</u>.

           This is useful if the branch on which you ran <b>git</b> <b>stash</b> <b>push</b> has changed enough that <b>git</b> <b>stash</b> <b>apply</b>
           fails due to conflicts. Since the stash entry is applied on top of the commit that was HEAD at the
           time <b>git</b> <b>stash</b> was run, it restores the originally stashed state with no conflicts.

       clear
           Remove all the stash entries. Note that those entries will then be subject to pruning, and may be
           impossible to recover (see <u>Examples</u> below for a possible strategy).

       drop [-q|--quiet] [&lt;stash&gt;]
           Remove a single stash entry from the list of stash entries.

       create
           Create a stash entry (which is a regular commit object) and return its object name, without storing
           it anywhere in the ref namespace. This is intended to be useful for scripts. It is probably not the
           command you want to use; see "push" above.

       store
           Store a given stash created via <u>git</u> <u>stash</u> <u>create</u> (which is a dangling merge commit) in the stash ref,
           updating the stash reflog. This is intended to be useful for scripts. It is probably not the command
           you want to use; see "push" above.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -a, --all
           This option is only valid for <b>push</b> and <b>save</b> commands.

           All ignored and untracked files are also stashed and then cleaned up with <b>git</b> <b>clean</b>.

       -u, --include-untracked, --no-include-untracked
           When used with the <b>push</b> and <b>save</b> commands, all untracked files are also stashed and then cleaned up
           with <b>git</b> <b>clean</b>.

           When used with the <b>show</b> command, show the untracked files in the stash entry as part of the diff.

       --only-untracked
           This option is only valid for the <b>show</b> command.

           Show only the untracked files in the stash entry as part of the diff.

       --index
           This option is only valid for <b>pop</b> and <b>apply</b> commands.

           Tries to reinstate not only the working tree’s changes, but also the index’s ones. However, this can
           fail, when you have conflicts (which are stored in the index, where you therefore can no longer apply
           the changes as they were originally).

       -k, --keep-index, --no-keep-index
           This option is only valid for <b>push</b> and <b>save</b> commands.

           All changes already added to the index are left intact.

       -p, --patch
           This option is only valid for <b>push</b> and <b>save</b> commands.

           Interactively select hunks from the diff between HEAD and the working tree to be stashed. The stash
           entry is constructed such that its index state is the same as the index state of your repository, and
           its worktree contains only the changes you selected interactively. The selected changes are then
           rolled back from your worktree. See the “Interactive Mode” section of <b><a href="../man1/git-add.1.html">git-add</a></b>(1) to learn how to
           operate the <b>--patch</b> mode.

           The <b>--patch</b> option implies <b>--keep-index</b>. You can use <b>--no-keep-index</b> to override this.

       -S, --staged
           This option is only valid for <b>push</b> and <b>save</b> commands.

           Stash only the changes that are currently staged. This is similar to basic <b>git</b> <b>commit</b> except the
           state is committed to the stash instead of current branch.

           The <b>--patch</b> option has priority over this one.

       --pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt;
           This option is only valid for <b>push</b> command.

           Pathspec is passed in <u>&lt;file&gt;</u> instead of commandline args. If <u>&lt;file&gt;</u> is exactly <b>-</b> then standard input
           is used. Pathspec elements are separated by LF or CR/LF. Pathspec elements can be quoted as explained
           for the configuration variable <b>core.quotePath</b> (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)). See also <b>--pathspec-file-nul</b> and
           global <b>--literal-pathspecs</b>.

       --pathspec-file-nul
           This option is only valid for <b>push</b> command.

           Only meaningful with <b>--pathspec-from-file</b>. Pathspec elements are separated with NUL character and all
           other characters are taken literally (including newlines and quotes).

       -q, --quiet
           This option is only valid for <b>apply</b>, <b>drop</b>, <b>pop</b>, <b>push</b>, <b>save</b>, <b>store</b> commands.

           Quiet, suppress feedback messages.

       --
           This option is only valid for <b>push</b> command.

           Separates pathspec from options for disambiguation purposes.

       &lt;pathspec&gt;...
           This option is only valid for <b>push</b> command.

           The new stash entry records the modified states only for the files that match the pathspec. The index
           entries and working tree files are then rolled back to the state in HEAD only for these files, too,
           leaving files that do not match the pathspec intact.

           For more details, see the <u>pathspec</u> entry in <b><a href="../man7/gitglossary.7.html">gitglossary</a></b>(7).

       &lt;stash&gt;
           This option is only valid for <b>apply</b>, <b>branch</b>, <b>drop</b>, <b>pop</b>, <b>show</b> commands.

           A reference of the form <b>stash@</b>{<u>&lt;revision&gt;</u>}. When no <u>&lt;stash&gt;</u> is given, the latest stash is assumed
           (that is, <b>stash@</b>{0}).

</pre><h4><b>DISCUSSION</b></h4><pre>
       A stash entry is represented as a commit whose tree records the state of the working directory, and its
       first parent is the commit at <b>HEAD</b> when the entry was created. The tree of the second parent records the
       state of the index when the entry is made, and it is made a child of the <b>HEAD</b> commit. The ancestry graph
       looks like this:

                  .----W
                 /    /
           -----H----I

       where <b>H</b> is the <b>HEAD</b> commit, <b>I</b> is a commit that records the state of the index, and <b>W</b> is a commit that
       records the state of the working tree.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Pulling into a dirty tree
           When you are in the middle of something, you learn that there are upstream changes that are possibly
           relevant to what you are doing. When your local changes do not conflict with the changes in the
           upstream, a simple <b>git</b> <b>pull</b> will let you move forward.

           However, there are cases in which your local changes do conflict with the upstream changes, and <b>git</b>
           <b>pull</b> refuses to overwrite your changes. In such a case, you can stash your changes away, perform a
           pull, and then unstash, like this:

               $ git pull
                ...
               file foobar not up to date, cannot merge.
               $ git stash
               $ git pull
               $ git stash pop

       Interrupted workflow
           When you are in the middle of something, your boss comes in and demands that you fix something
           immediately. Traditionally, you would make a commit to a temporary branch to store your changes away,
           and return to your original branch to make the emergency fix, like this:

               # ... hack hack hack ...
               $ git switch -c my_wip
               $ git commit -a -m "WIP"
               $ git switch master
               $ edit emergency fix
               $ git commit -a -m "Fix in a hurry"
               $ git switch my_wip
               $ git reset --soft HEAD^
               # ... continue hacking ...

           You can use <u>git</u> <u>stash</u> to simplify the above, like this:

               # ... hack hack hack ...
               $ git stash
               $ edit emergency fix
               $ git commit -a -m "Fix in a hurry"
               $ git stash pop
               # ... continue hacking ...

       Testing partial commits
           You can use <b>git</b> <b>stash</b> <b>push</b> <b>--keep-index</b> when you want to make two or more commits out of the changes
           in the work tree, and you want to test each change before committing:

               # ... hack hack hack ...
               $ git add --patch foo            # add just first part to the index
               $ git stash push --keep-index    # save all other changes to the stash
               $ edit/build/test first part
               $ git commit -m 'First part'     # commit fully tested change
               $ git stash pop                  # prepare to work on all other changes
               # ... repeat above five steps until one commit remains ...
               $ edit/build/test remaining parts
               $ git commit foo -m 'Remaining parts'

       Saving unrelated changes for future use
           When you are in the middle of massive changes and you find some unrelated issue that you don’t want
           to forget to fix, you can do the change(s), stage them, and use <b>git</b> <b>stash</b> <b>push</b> <b>--staged</b> to stash them
           out for future use. This is similar to committing the staged changes, only the commit ends-up being
           in the stash and not on the current branch.

               # ... hack hack hack ...
               $ git add --patch foo           # add unrelated changes to the index
               $ git stash push --staged       # save these changes to the stash
               # ... hack hack hack, finish current changes ...
               $ git commit -m 'Massive'       # commit fully tested changes
               $ git switch fixup-branch       # switch to another branch
               $ git stash pop                 # to finish work on the saved changes

       Recovering stash entries that were cleared/dropped erroneously
           If you mistakenly drop or clear stash entries, they cannot be recovered through the normal safety
           mechanisms. However, you can try the following incantation to get a list of stash entries that are
           still in your repository, but not reachable any more:

               git fsck --unreachable |
               grep commit | cut -d\  -f3 |
               xargs git log --merges --no-walk --grep=WIP
