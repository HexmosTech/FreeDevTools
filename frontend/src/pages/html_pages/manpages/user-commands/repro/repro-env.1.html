</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       repro-env - Dependency lockfiles for reproducible build environments

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>repro-env</b> update

       <b>repro-env</b> build -- [<u>COMMAND</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Tracks  a  description  of  a  desired  state  in <b>repro-env.toml</b>, for example, the latest version of some
       official container image, with the latest patch level and the latest version of some additional packages.
       It also tracks a resolved variant in <b>repro-env.lock</b> that tracks the specific versions  and  checksums  of
       the  packages  needed  to  set  up the described environment (at the patch-level available at the time of
       writing).

       The purpose of <b>repro-env.toml</b> is to make it trivial to re-resolve the specification if new patches become
       available. This file is read by <b>repro-env</b> <b>update</b>.

       The purpose of <b>repro-env.lock</b> is to document which compiler versions  have  been  used  for  the  release
       binary  associated  with a given release. Recording this information is essential for reproducible builds
       and allows future forensic investigation of the build environment. It can be either  committed  into  the
       source-code repository or attached to a release as an artifact, along with the compiled binary. This file
       is read by <b>repro-env</b> <b>build</b>.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Increase logging output (can be used multiple times)

       <b>-C</b> <u>path</u>, <b>--context</b> <u>path</u>
           Change the current directory to this path before executing the subcommand

</pre><h4><b>UPDATE</b></h4><pre>
       This  command  resolves the environment described in <b>repro-env.toml</b> with the latest available updates and
       writes a <b>repro-env.lock</b>. You would use this command similar to how you would use <b>cargo</b> <b>update</b>.

       <b>--no-pull</b>
           Do not attempt to pull the container tag from registry before resolving it

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keep</b>
           Do not delete the build container, wait for ctrl-c

</pre><h4><b>BUILD</b></h4><pre>
       This command loads a <b>repro-env.lock</b>, sets up the environment it describes in a container and  mounts  the
       current  directory  to  <b>/build</b>  inside  of  the  container. It then runs the given <u>COMMAND</u> inside of this
       container.

       <b>-f</b> <u>path</u>, --file <u>path</u>
           The dependency lockfile to use

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keep</b>
           Do not delete the build container, wait for ctrl-c

       <b>-e</b> <u>env</u>, --env <u>env</u>
           Pass environment variables into the build container (FOO=bar or just FOO to lookup the value)

</pre><h4><b>PACKAGES:</b> <b>ARCH</b> <b>LINUX</b></h4><pre>
       Arch Linux hosts a comprehensive collection of recent compilers at https://archive.archlinux.org. You can
       create a <b>[packages]</b> section in your <b>repro-env.toml</b>  with  <b>system</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>"archlinux"</b>  to  install  additional
       packages with pacman.

           # repro-env.toml
           [container]
           image = "docker.io/library/archlinux"

           [packages]
           system = "archlinux"
           dependencies = ["rust-musl", "lua"]

</pre><h4><b>PACKAGES:</b> <b>DEBIAN</b></h4><pre>
       Debian   is   a   widely   accepted   choice   and   hosts   an   archive   of   all  their  packages  at
       https://snapshot.debian.org/. You can create a <b>[packages]</b> section in your <b>repro-env.toml</b>  with  <b>system</b>  <b>=</b>
       <b>"debian"</b> to install additional packages with apt-get.

           # repro-env.toml
           [container]
           image = "debian:bookworm"

           [packages]
           system = "debian"
           dependencies = ["gcc", "libc6-dev"]

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
