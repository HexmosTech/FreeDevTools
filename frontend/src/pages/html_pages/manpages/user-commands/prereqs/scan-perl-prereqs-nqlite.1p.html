</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       scan-perl-prereqs-nqlite

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         scan-perl-prereqs-nqlite [DIRS|FILES]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "scan-perl-prereqs-nqlite" traverses several files and subdirectories in the current directory with
       File::Find to collect all ".pl", ".PL", ".pm", ".t", ".psgi" files (as well as all the files in
       "scripts?" and "bin" directories), and prints a single combined list of prerequisites, which should be
       suitable for piping to "cpanm" or similar tools.

       You can also pass files and/or directories to limit files to scan.  In this case, however,
       "scan-perl-prereqs-nqlite" may fail to exclude modules that should belong to the same distribution.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       version
           Show the version.

       help
           Show this help.

       json
           Print prerequisites as a JSON if JSON::PP is installed.

       cpanfile, save_cpanfile
           Print prerequisites as "cpanfile" if Module::CPANfile is installed. If "safe-cpanfile" is set, create
           or update "cpanfile".

       suggests
           Print suggestions ("use"d modules in "eval") as well.

       develop
           Print  requirements/suggestions  for  developers ("use"d modules in "xt" and "author" directories) as
           well.

       perl_minimum_version
           May modify required perl version if new language features are used  without  declaring  the  required
           perl version explicitly.

       exclude_core
           Ignore   prerequisites   that  are  bundled  with  Perl  (of  5.008001  by  default).  This  requires
           Module::CoreList version 2.99 or above.

       perl_version
           Ignore prerequisites that are bundled with Perl of a specific version. This implies "exclude-core" as
           well.

       allow_test_pms
           Print requirements/suggestions in .pm files that are placed under t/ directory but are  not  directly
           used from .t files, too.  If Test::Class family is used under t/, this option is implicitly set.

       base_dir
           Set the base directory from where "scan-perl-prereqs-nqlite" starts traversing files and directories.

       ignore
           Set  a  list of paths "scan-perl-prereqs-nqlite" should ignore. This is useful when your distribution
           has a set of OS-specific modules, for example.

       ignore_re
           You can also specify a regexp instead of a list of paths.  If  this  is  set,  "ignore"  options  are
           ignored.

       optional
           Set  a  list of paths "scan-perl-prereqs-nqlite" should ignore. This is useful when your distribution
           has a set of OS-specific modules, for example.

       optional_re
           You can also specify a regexp instead of a list of paths. If this  is  set,  "optional"  options  are
           ignored.

       private
           Set  a  list  of  modules  "scan-perl-prereqs-nqlite"  should consider private, that is, that are not
           uploaded to the CPAN. Contrary to the "ignore" option, which makes  the  scanner  skip  scanning  the
           file, this option lets the scanner scan files, and excludes matched prerequisites afterwards.

       private_re
           You  can  also  specify  a regexp instead of a list of modules. If this is set, "private" options are
           ignored.

       scan_also
           Set a list of extra paths "scan-perl-prereqs-nqlite" should also  scan.  This  is  useful  when  your
           application/distribution uses an untraditional file layout.

       feature
             scan-perl-prereqs-nqlite \
               --feature name:description:lib/My/Plugin/For/SpecificOS \
               --feature name:description:web/lib,web/bin

           Specify a feature name, a description, and matching paths.

       use_index
           You  can  specify  an  index name of CPAN::Common::Index module (such as "Mirror" or "MetaDB") not to
           list all the modules of a required distribution.

       blib
           If this is set, "scan-perl-prereqs-nqlite" will  traverse  subdirectories  under  "blib"  to  collect
           runtime requirements.  It may return better results if some of the files are located in some uncommon
           places  and/or some of them are listed in "no_index".  However, files in "blib" may be older than the
           ones under "lib" etc, and you need to update them by running a make or a "Build"  script  before  you
           run "scan-perl-prereqs-nqlite".

       parser
           Set  a  list  of parsers (or parser tags) "scan-perl-prereqs-nqlite" uses. If this option is not set,
           the scanner uses ":installed" parsers by default.

       inc Add a list of additional @INC path "scan-perl-prereqs-nqlite" looks for private parsers.

       verbose
           Print verbose messages.
