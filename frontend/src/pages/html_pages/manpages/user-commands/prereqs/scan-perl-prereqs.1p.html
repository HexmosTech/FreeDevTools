</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::PrereqScanner::App - scan your working dir for likely prereqs

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.100

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           scan-perl-prereqs [--by-file] [--pretty] [DIRS | FILES]

       Directories are traversed with File::Find to collect all ".pl", ".pm", ".psgi" and ".t" files. If no
       directories or files are specified, the current working directory is scanned.

       The default is to print a single combined list suitable for piping to "cpanm" or similar tools.

       The "--by-file" switch will print results grouped by the files in which they were found.

       The "--pretty" swith will print results in a more human-friendly format, with names and versions
       vertically aligned.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
