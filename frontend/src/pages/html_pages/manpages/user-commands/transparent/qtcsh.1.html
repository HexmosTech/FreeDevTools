       qtcsh - tcsh with transparent remote execution by use of qrsh

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>qtcsh</b> [ <b>tcsh</b> <b>options</b> | <b>-ABLR</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Qtcsh</u>  is  an extension to the popular <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) derivative <u>tcsh</u>. It allows the transparent remote execution
       of commands entered in <u>qtcsh</u> controlled via Grid Engine.   <u>Qtcsh</u>  can  be  used  as  interactive  command
       interpreter as well as for the processing of <u>tcsh</u> shell scripts.

       When  invoked, <u>qtcsh</u> identifies which commands are to be run remotely and which are not. For this purpose
       the files &lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/common/qtask and <a href="file:~/.qtask">~/.qtask</a> are processed. Each line in these files  defines  a
       command  that  is  intended  to  be  run remotely (see <u><a href="../man5/qtask.5.html">qtask</a></u>(5) for a definition of the file format). The
       .qtask file in the user's home directory contains the user's remote task specification, while the file in
       the common directory is maintained by the administrator and defines a cluster-wide default behavior.  The
       contents of the administrator supplied <u><a href="../man5/qtask.5.html">qtask</a></u>(5) file are  completely  overridden  in  case  there  is  an
       appropriate  entry in the users <u><a href="../man5/qtask.5.html">qtask</a></u>(5) file.  This is prevented in case an exclamation mark is prefixed
       to the command name in the administrators qtask file.

       <u>Qtcsh</u> always attempts to start the designated tasks remotely via <u><a href="../man1/qrsh.1.html">qrsh</a></u>(1).  Exceptions are

       •  if the user enters such commands via a relative  or  absolute  pathname  instead  of  the  stand-alone
          command name (see <u><a href="../man5/qtask.5.html">qtask</a></u>(5) for more information);

       •  if  the  environment  variable  JOB_ID  is  set  and thus <u>qtcsh</u> assumes that execution already happens
          remotely within a Grid Engine job and thus executes tasks locally. This avoids unwanted recursions but
          can be  overridden  by  the  command-line  option  <b>-R</b>  and  the  built-in  command  <u>qrshmode</u>  <u>-R</u>  (see
          corresponding descriptions below);

       •  if  <u>qtcsh</u>  cannot  establish a connection of Grid Engine during start-up. This allows using <u>qtcsh</u> as a
          login shell without the danger of being blocked when no Grid Engine service is available.

       <u>Qtcsh</u> can operate in three different modes determining whether

       •  tasks are executed remotely;

       •  immediate or batch execution is requested;

       •  status output is verbose or only in case of any errors.

       These modes either can be controlled by the command-line switches described below during <u>qtcsh</u> invocation
       or within an executing <u>qtcsh</u> via  the  built-in  command  <u>qrshmode</u>,  as  described  in  section  <b>BUILT-IN</b>
       <b>COMMANDS</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options listed below are specific to <u>qtcsh</u>. The user is referred to the <u><a href="../man1/tcsh.1.html">tcsh</a></u>(1) documentation for the
       explanation of further options.

       <b>-A</b>     Switches <u>qtcsh</u> into verbose mode, causing diagnostic output in case of remote execution.

       <b>-B</b>     Switches  remote  task execution into batch mode. Tasks submitted to Grid Engine will be queued if
              they cannot start immediately.  As a consequence, <u>qtcsh</u> may block until the  queued  task  can  be
              started by Grid Engine. While this behavior probably is undesirable during an interactive session,
              it  may  be  very useful for execution of shell scripts through <u>qtcsh</u>, as it avoids failure of the
              scripts due to temporarily unavailable resources for particular tasks.

       <b>-L</b>     Switches off the default behavior of remote execution of  commands.  Causes  all  commands  to  be
              executed locally even if they are contained in one of the <u><a href="../man5/qtask.5.html">qtask</a></u>(5) files.

       <b>-R</b>     Enforces remote execution of commands even if JOB_ID is set as environment variable.

</pre><h4><b>BUILT-IN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  only  describes  additional  shell  builtin  commands  which are not available in standard
       <u><a href="../man1/tcsh.1.html">tcsh</a></u>(1).

       <b>qrshmode</b> [<b>-ANBILR</b>]
              Without options, the current operational  mode  of  <u>qtcsh</u>  is  displayed.  The  options  have  the
              following effect:

              -A   switch to verbose output mode
              -N   switch to non-verbose output mode
              -B   switch to batch execution mode
              -I   switch to immediate execution mode
              -L   always execute commands locally
              -R   execute configured commands remotely

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SGE_ROOT</b>       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard configuration files.

       <b>SGE_CELL</b>       If  set,  specifies the default Grid Engine cell. To address a Grid Engine cell <u>qtcsh</u> uses
                      (in the order of precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. <b>default</b>.

       <b>SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</b>
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be written  to  stderr.  In  addition  the
                      level of detail in which debug information is generated is defined.

       <b>SGE_QMASTER_PORT</b>
                      If  set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which  <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8)  is  expected to listen for
                      communication requests.  Most installations will use a services map entry for the  service
                      "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

       <b>JOB_ID</b>         If  set  when starting <u>qtcsh</u> the local operation mode is activated implicitly as if the <b>-L</b>
                      option was specified.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.qtask">~/.qtask</a></u>       user qtask file.
       <u>&lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/common/qtask</u>
                      cluster qtask file.
