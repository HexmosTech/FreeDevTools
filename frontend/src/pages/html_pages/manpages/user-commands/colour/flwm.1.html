</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <u>flwm</u> - The Fast Light Window Manager

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>flwm</b> [-d[isplay] host:n.n] [-g[eometry] WxH+X+Y] [-fg color] [-bg color] [-bg2 color]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>flwm</u> is a very small and fast X window manager, featuring <u>no</u> icons and "sideways" title bars.

</pre><h4><b>.xinitrc</b> <b>/</b> <b>.xsession</b></h4><pre>
       To  run  flwm  as  your  login script, you need to create or replace <a href="file:~/.xinitrc">~/.xinitrc</a> or <a href="file:~/.xsession">~/.xsession</a> (or both).
       Newer Linux systems with a login panel use .xsession, older systems where X was started after  login  use
       .xinitrc.  You may also have to pick "default" from the "type of session" popup in your login window.

       The .xinitrc or .xsession file should look like this:

       #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
       xsetroot -solid \#006060
       xrdb .Xresources
       # xset, xmodmap, other configuration programs
       flwm &amp;
       WindowManager=$!
       # xterm, other automatically-launched programs
       wait $WindowManager

</pre><h4><b>SWITCHES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d[isplay]</b> <b>host:#.#</b> Sets the display and screen for flwm to manage

       <b>-v[isual]</b> <b>#</b> Visual number to use (probably only works for non-color-mapped ones)

       <b>-g[eometry]</b>  <b>WxH+X+Y</b>  Flwm  will  act as though the screen is only the specified area.  It will constrain
       initial window positions to this area and stop them at the edges when dragging them around.  This can  be
       used to surround the screen with fixed "toolbars" that are never covered by windows.  These toolbars must
       be created by a program using override-redirect so that flwm does not try to move them.

       <b>-m[aximum]</b>  <b>WxH</b>  Set the size of windows when the maximize buttons are pushed.  Normally this is the size
       of the screen. This is useful for XFree86 servers that are run with a smaller screen than display memory.

       <b>-x</b> The menu will say "Exit" instead of "Logout" and will not ask for confirmation. This is a good idea if
       you are running flwm in some other way than with exec at the end of .xinitrc, since it won't log you  out
       then.

       <b>-fg</b> <b>color,</b> <b>-bg</b> <b>color</b> Set the label color and the color of the window frames and the menu.

       <b>-c[ursor]</b>  <b>#</b>  What cursor to use on the desktop (you will have to experiment to find out what each number
       means)

       <b>-cfg</b> <b>color,</b> <b>-cbg</b> <b>color</b> Colors for the desktop and window resizing cursors

       In addition to these switches there is much customization that can be done by editing the  config.h  file
       in the source code and recompiling.  GCC is your friend.

</pre><h4><b>MENU</b> <b>ITEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Flwm  can  launch  programs  from its menu. This is controlled by files in the directory <b><a href="file:~/.wmx">~/.wmx</a></b> (this was
       chosen to be compatible with wmx and wm2).

       Each executable file in <a href="file:~/.wmx">~/.wmx</a> is a program to run. Usually these are symbolic links to the real  program
       or very short shell scripts.

       Each subdirectory creates a child menu so you can build a hierarchy (up to 10 deep).

       Cut and paste the following lines you your shell to create some example files:

       mkdir <a href="file:~/.wmx">~/.wmx</a>
       ln -s /usr/bin/gimp <a href="file:~/.wmx/">~/.wmx/</a>"The Gimp"
       cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; <a href="file:~/.wmx/">~/.wmx/</a>"Terminal"
       #! <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
       /usr/bin/rxvt -ut
       EOF
       chmod +x !*

       On  Debian, flwm has been modified to support a system-wide menu <b>/var/lib/flwm/wmx</b> when no <b><a href="file:~/.wmx">~/.wmx</a></b> exists,
       and scripts were added to take advantage of the Debian menu system (see <b><a href="../man1/update-menus.1.html">update-menus</a></b>(1)).

</pre><h4><b>MOUSE</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Left-click</b> on a window border raises window.

       <b>Left-drag</b> will move the window when in the title bar, and will resize it in  the  edges.  If  the  window
       cannot be resized then it will always move the window. What it will do is indicated by the cursor shape.

       <b>Middle-click</b> on a window border lowers it to bottom.

       <b>Middle-drag</b> anywhere on window border will move the window.

       When  you  move a window it will stop at the edges of the screen.  Dragging about 150 pixels further will
       unstick it and let you drag it off the screen.

       <b>Right-click</b> on a window border pops up the menu.

       <b>Any</b> <b>button</b> on the desktop will pop up the menu.

</pre><h4><b>BUTTONS</b></h4><pre>
       The empty button "iconizes" the window: it will completely vanish. To get it back use the menu.

       The vertical-bar button "shades" (or "Venetian blinds"?) the window.   Click  it  again  to  restore  the
       window.  You can also resize the shaded window to a new height or "open" it by resizing horizontally.

       The two buttons below it toggle maximum height and/or maximum width.

       The X button at the bottom closes the window.

</pre><h4><b>MENU</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Right-click</b>  on window border, or <b>any-click</b> on the desktop, or typing <b>Alt+Esc</b> or <b>Alt+Tab</b> or <b>Alt+Shift+Tab</b>
       will pop up the menu.

       Releasing Alt will pick the current menu item. This makes flwm work very much (exactly?) like the Windows
       95 shortcuts.

       Each main window is a menu item. If the window is "iconized" the little picture shows an open  rectangle,
       otherwise  it  shows a filled rectangle.  Picking a menu item deiconizes and raises that window and warps
       the pointer so it is current.

       <b>New</b> <b>desktop</b> asks for a name of a new desktop and makes it current. The desktop will  initially  be  empty
       (except for sticky items).

       To  move windows to the current desktop, pop up the menu and pick windows off of other desktops (if using
       the keyboard, use left arrow to go to the desktop names, move up and down to the other desktop,  and  use
       right arrow to enter that desktop). The window will be moved from the other desktop to the current one.

       To  switch to another desktop, pick the title of the desktop (if using the keyboard, use left arrow to go
       to the desktop names, move up and down to the other desktop).

       If a desktop is empty you can delete it. Its sub menu will show <b>delete</b> <b>this</b> <b>desktop.</b>  Pick that  and  the
       desktop is gone.

       <b>Sticky</b>  is a special "desktop": windows on it appear on all desktops. To make a window "sticky" switch to
       the Sticky desktop and pick the window off its current desktop (thus "moving" it to the Sticky  desktop).
       To "unstick" a window go to another desktop and pick the window off the sticky desktop menu.

       <b>New</b>  <b>xterm</b> will run a new xterm on the current desktop. Useful if you accidentally close everything. This
       item does not appear if a <a href="file:~/.wmx">~/.wmx</a> directory exists.

       <b>Logout</b> will ask for confirmation and if so flwm will exit.

       <b>Exit</b> will exit flwm without confirmation. This item will appear if flwm was run with the -x switch.

</pre><h4><b>HOT</b> <b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       These are the defaults, the hot keys may be different depending on how flwm was compiled:

       <b>Alt+Escape</b> Pops up the menu with the current window preselected

       <b>Alt+Tab</b> Pops up the menu with the next window preselected

       <b>Alt+Shift+Tab</b> Pops up the menu with the previous window preselected

       <b>Ctrl+Tab</b> Switch to the next desktop.

       <b>Ctrl+Shift+Tab</b> Switch to the previous desktop.

       <b>Ctrl+Function</b> <b>key</b> Switch to desktop N.

       <b>Alt+Up</b> Raise the current window.

       <b>Alt+Down</b> Lower the current window.

       <b>Alt+Delete</b> Close the current window (same as clicking close box).

       <b>Alt+Enter</b> "Iconizes" (hides) the current window.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       It is impossible to move windows smaller than 100 pixels off the screen.

       Only obeys "keep aspect" if the aspect ratio is 1x1.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       This program was inspired by and much  code  copied  from  the  "wm2"  window  manager  by  Chris  Cannam

       Thanks to Ron Koerner for the recursive .wmx directory reading code.
