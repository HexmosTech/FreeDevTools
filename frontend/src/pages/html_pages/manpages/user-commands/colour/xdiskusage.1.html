</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xdiskusage</u> - Graphical display of disk usage

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xdiskusage</b>  [-a]  [-d[isplay]  host:n.n] [-g[eometry] WxH+X+Y] [-t[itle] windowtitle] [-n[ame] classname]
       [-i[conic]] [-fg color] [-bg color] [-bg2 color] [directory...] [file...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xdiskusage</u> displays the output of "du" in an X  window,  allowing  you  to  compare  visually  the  space
       occupied by files and directories.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Typing  "xdiskusage  dir"  where  "dir"  is  a folder causes "du" to be run on that folder and the result
       displayed.  If the named file is a symbolic link it is dereferenced before being sent  to  du.  The  "-a"
       switch, if given, is passed to "du" to cause all files to be measured.

       Typing  "xdiskusage  file" where "file" is not a folder makes xdiskusage parse that file as though it was
       "du" output and display the result.

       You can type several file and folder names and get several display windows.

       If no files are named, you can pipe the output from another program to xdiskusage.  If  stdin  is  not  a
       terminal  xdiskusage  will  parse  it  as  "du"  output  and  display the result. For instance "du -k . |
       xdiskusage".

       Typing just "xdiskusage" brings up the disk browser described here:

</pre><h4><b>DISK</b> <b>BROWSER</b></h4><pre>
       By default xdiskusage presents you with a list of all the disks mounted on your system (it found these by
       running "df").  Click one of these names and it will scan the entire disk (by running "du") and present a
       graphical display of how much space all the files are taking on that disk.

       You can click on several disks (or on the same disk multiple times, for instance if you have changed  the
       files stored on it) and get multiple display windows.

       The  "rescan" button reruns "df" to get a new list of disks.  You need to do this if you mount or unmount
       a disk, or to see new usage percentages.

       The (C) button shows you the copyright and license.

       You can type a filename into the input field on the bottom and type Enter. If the name  is  a  directory,
       xdiskusage  will attempt to run "du" on it and display the result. If the name is a file it is assumed to
       be "du" output and it is parsed and displayed.

       The "all files" button sends the -a switch to "du" causing it to list the space for  every  file  on  the
       disk.  This can significantly increase the time it takes to scan.

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAY</b></h4><pre>
       Each  white box represents a folder.  It's size is equal to the sum of all it's contents (all sub-folders
       and files).  To the right of each box are stacked the boxes for the sub-folders (and files  if  the  "all
       files" switch was given).

       If you selected a disk from the disk browser, some extra boxes are added to show information learned from
       df:

         "(free)" is the free space reported by df.

         "(permission denied)" is space that df said was used but du did not
         report. Besides permission errors when running du, this may also be
         the result of a file deleted from its containing folder, but still
         in use by a program, so its space is not reclaimed yet. Mounted
         loopback filesystems (ISO image just checked before burning, then
         deleted while still mounted) are common examples.

         "(inodes)" is the difference between the total size of the disk and
         the used + available space reported by du, this is overhead used by
         the file system.

       The left-most box is the "current root". One of the boxes is outlined in red, this is the "current node".

       Clicking  on  any  box makes it the current node. The arrow keys can also be used to navigate you around.
       Hitting return makes the current node be the current root: putting it on the left edge and blowing it  up
       to  the  height  of the window and scaling all it's contents the same. The left arrow can be used to move
       the root and current node back up, or you can type '/' to move just the root, leaving  the  current  node
       where it is.

       To dismiss any window type Escape.

</pre><h4><b>MENU</b> <b>ITEMS</b></h4><pre>
       There  is  a pop-up menu on the right-hand mouse button.  Every item on the menu has a keyboard shortcut.
       The menu items are:

       <b>In</b> <b>(right</b> <b>arrow)</b> go to the first child of the current folder.

       <b>Next</b> <b>(down</b> <b>arrow)</b> go down to brother of current folder.

       <b>Previous</b> <b>(up</b> <b>arrow)</b> go up to the brother of current folder.

       <b>Out</b> <b>(left</b> <b>arrow)</b> go to parent of current folder.

       <b>Root</b> <b>out</b> <b>(slash)</b> move the root of the window up to it's parent.

       <b>Hide</b> <b>(h)</b> remove this node from the display and scale rest up to fit

       <b>Unhide</b> <b>(H)</b> Recursively turn off the hide flag from all children

       <b>Sort/Largest</b> <b>(s)</b> sort largest size at the top

       <b>Sort/Smallest</b> <b>(r)</b> sort smallest size at the top

       <b>Sort/Alphabetical</b> <b>(a)</b> sort in alphabetical order

       <b>Sort/Reverse</b> <b>Alphabetical</b> <b>(z)</b> sort in backwards alphabetical order

       <b>Sort/Unsorted</b> <b>(u)</b> sort in the order read from du.

       <b>Columns/2-11</b> <b>(2-9,0,1)</b> arrange display to have N columns.

       <b>Copy</b> <b>to</b> <b>Clipboard</b> <b>(c)</b> the pathname of the current node is put in the X clipboard (you can then  paste  it
       into a shell command).

       <b>Print</b>  <b>(p)</b> The current display is printed.  The output is Encapsulated PostScript.  It will either run it
       through lpr (or any command you choose) or send it to a file.

       <b>Quit</b> <b>(q</b> <b>or</b> <b>Esc)</b> Quit the application.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Gets confused by "df" output on some platforms, requiring platform-specific code.
