       All  options  can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You may use two hyphens instead of one
       to designate an option.  You may use either white space or an equals sign between an option name and  its
       value.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pnmremap</b>  replaces  the  colors in an input image with those from a palette you specify.  Where colors in
       the input are present in the palette, they just stay the  same  in  the  output.   But  where  the  input
       contains a color that is not in the palette, <b>pnmremap</b> gives you these choices:

       •      Choose the closest color from the palette.

       •      Choose the first color from the palette.

       •      Use a color specified by a command option (<b>-missing</b>).

       •      Dither.   This  means rather than mapping pixel by pixel, <b>pnmremap</b> uses colors from the palette to
              try to make multi-pixel regions of the output have the  same  average  color  as  the  input  (for
              another kind of dithering, see <b>ppmdither</b>).

       Two  reasons  to use this program are: 1) you want to reduce the number of colors in the input image; and
       2) you need to feed the image to something that can handle only certain colors.

       To reduce colors, you can generate the palette with <b>pnmcolormap</b>.

       By default, <b>pnmremap</b> maps an input color that is not in the palette to the closest color that <u>is</u>  in  the
       palette.   Closest  means  with  the smallest Cartesian distance in the red, green, blue brightness space
       (smallest sum of the squares of the differences in red,  green,  and  blue  ITU-R  Recommendation  BT.709
       gamma-adjusted intensities).

       You  can instead specify a single default color for <b>pnmremap</b> to use for any color in the input image that
       is not in the palette.  Use the <b>-missing</b> option for this.

       You can also specify that the first color in the palette image is the default.  Use  the  <b>-firstisdefault</b>
       option for this.

       The  palette is simply a PNM image.  The colors of the pixels in the image are the colors in the palette.
       Where the pixels appear in the image, and the dimensions of the image, are irrelevant.   Multiple  pixels
       of the same color are fine.  However, a palette image is typically a single row with one pixel per color.

       If  you  specify  <b>-missing</b>,  the color you so specify is in the palette in addition to whatever is in the
       palette image.

       For historical reasons, Netpbm sometimes calls the palette  a  "colormap."  But  it  doesn't  really  map
       anything.   <b>pnmremap</b>  creates  its  own  map, based on the palette, to map colors from the input image to
       output colors.

   <b>Palette/Image</b> <b>Type</b> <b>Mismatch</b>
       In the simple case, the palette image is of the same depth (number of planes, i.e. number  of  components
       in  each tuple (pixel)) as the input image and <b>pnmremap</b> just does a straightforward search of the palette
       for each input tuple (pixel).  In fact, <b>pnmremap</b> doesn't even care if the image is a visual image.

       But what about when the depths differ?  In that case, <b>pnmremap</b> converts  the  input  image  (in  its  own
       memory) to match the palette and then proceeds as above.

       There  are  only  two  such  cases in which <b>pnmremap</b> knows how to do the conversion:  when one of them is
       tuple type RGB, depth 3, and the other is tuple type GRAYSCALE or BLACKANDWHITE, depth 1; and vice versa.

       In any other case, <b>pnmremap</b> issues and error message and fails.

       Note that as long as your input and palette images are PNM, they'll always fall into  one  of  the  cases
       <b>pnmremap</b> can handle.  There's an issue only if you're using some exotic PAM image.

       Before  Netpbm  10.27 (March 2005), <b>pnmremap</b> could not handle the case of a palette of greater depth than
       the input image.  (It would issue an error message and fail in that  case).   You  can  use  <b>ppmtoppm</b>  to
       increase the depth of the input image to work around this limitation.

       In any case, the output image has the same tuple type and depth as the palette image.

   <b>Multiple</b> <b>Image</b> <b>Stream</b>
       <b>pnmremap</b>  handles  a  multiple  image  input stream, producing a multiple image output stream.  The input
       images need not be similar in any way.

       Before Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005), <b>pnmremap</b> ignored any image after the first.

   <b>Examples</b>
       pnmcolormap testimg.ppm 256 &gt;palette.ppm

       pnmremap -map=palette.ppm testimg.ppm &gt;reduced_testimg.ppm

       To limit colors to a certain set, a typical example is to create an image for posting on the  World  Wide
       Web,  where different browsers know different colors.  But all browsers are supposed to know the 216 "web
       safe" colors which are essentially all the colors you can represent in a PPM image with a  maxval  of  5.
       So you can do this:

       pamseq 3 5 &gt;websafe.pam

       pnmremap -map=websafe.pam testimg.ppm &gt;websafe_testimg.ppm

       Another useful palette is one for the 8 color IBM TTL color set, which you can create with
       pamseq 3 1 &gt;ibmttl.pam

       If  you  want  to  quantize  one  image  to use the colors in another one, just use the second one as the
       palette.  You don't have to reduce it down to only one pixel of each color, just use it as is.

       The output image has the same type and maxval as the palette image.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       There is one parameter, which is required: The file specification of the input PNM file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably  <b>-quiet</b>,  see   Common
       Options ), <b>pnmremap</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       <b>-mapfile=</b><u>palettefilename</u>
              This names the file that contains the palette image.

              This option is mandatory.

       <b>-floyd</b>

       <b>-fs</b>

       <b>-nofloyd</b>

       <b>-nofs</b>  These options determine whether <b>pnmremap</b> does Floyd-Steinberg dithering.  Without Floyd-Steinberg,
              <b>pnmremap</b>  selects  the  output color of a pixel based on the color of only the corresponding input
              pixel.  With Floyd-Steinberg, <b>pnmremap</b> considers regions of pixels such that the average color  of
              a region is the same in the output as in the input.  The dithering effect appears as a dot pattern
              up  close, but from a distance, the dots blend so that you see more colors than are present in the
              color map.

              As an example, if your color map contains only black and white, and the input image has 4 adjacent
              pixels of gray, <b>pnmremap</b> with Floyd-Steinberg would generate output pixels  black,  white,  black,
              white,  which  from a distance looks gray.  But without Floyd-Steinberg, <b>pnmremap</b> would generate 4
              white pixels, white being the single-pixel approximation of gray.

              Floyd-Steinberg gives vastly better results on images where unmodified quantization has banding or
              other artifacts, especially when going to a small number of colors such  as  the  above  IBM  set.
              However, it does take substantially more CPU time.

              <b>-fs</b> is a synonym for <b>-floyd</b>.  <b>-nofs</b> is a synonym for <b>-nofloyd</b>.

              The default is <b>-nofloyd</b>.

              Before  Netpbm 10.46 (March 2009), dithering doesn't work quite as you expect if the color map has
              a lower maxval than the input.  <b>pnmremap</b> reduces the color resolution to the  color  map's  maxval
              before  doing  any  dithering, so the dithering does not have the effect of making the image, at a
              distance, appear to have the original maxval.  In current Netpbm, it does.

       <b>-norandom</b>
              This option affects a detail of the Floyd-Steinberg dithering process.  It has no  effect  if  you
              aren't doing Floyd-Steinberg dithering.

              By  default,  <b>pnmremap</b> initializes the error propagation accumulator to random values to avoid the
              appearance of unwanted patterns.  This is an extension of the original Floyd-Steinberg algorithm.

              A drawback of this is that the same <b>pnmremap</b> on the same input produces slightly different  output
              every time, which makes comparison difficult.

              With  <b>-norandom</b>,  <b>pnmremap</b> initializes the error accumulators to zero and the output is completely
              predictable.

              Alternatively, you can use <b>-randomseed</b> to get randomization  across  the  image,  but  still  have
              repeatable results.

              You cannot specify this along with <b>-randomseed</b>.

              <b>-norandom</b> was new in Netpbm 10.39 (June 2007).

       <b>-randomseed=</b><u>n</u>
              This  option  affects  a detail of the Floyd-Steinberg dithering process.  It has no effect if you
              aren't doing Floyd-Steinberg dithering.

              This option supplies the seed for the random number generator used in  the  randomization  process
              described  in  the  explanation  of the <b>-norandom</b> option.  If you run <b>pnmremap</b> twice with the same
              <b>-randomseed</b> value, you will get identical results.

              If you do not specify <b>-randomseed</b>, <b>pnmremap</b> chooses a seed at  random,  adding  another  level  of
              randomness to the dithering.

              You cannot specify this along with <b>-norandom</b>.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.82 (March 2018).

       <b>-firstisdefault</b>
              This  tells  <b>pnmremap</b>  to map any input color that is not in the palette to the first color in the
              palette (the color of the pixel in the top left corner of the palette image)

              See DESCRIPTION .

              If you specify <b>-firstisdefault</b>, the maxval of your input must match the  maxval  of  your  palette
              image.

       <b>-missingcolor=</b><u>colorspec</u>
              This  specifies  the default color for <b>pnmremap</b> to map to a color in the input image that isn't in
              the palette.  <u>color</u> may or may not be in the palette image; it is part of the palette regardless.

              <u>colorspec</u> is as described for the argument of the <b>pnm_parsecolor()</b> library routine .

              If you specify <b>-missingcolor</b>, the maxval of your input must  match  the  maxval  of  your  palette
              image.

       <b>-verbose</b>
              Display helpful messages about the mapping process.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pnmremap</b> first appeared in Netpbm 9.23 (January 2002).  Before that, its function was available  only  as
       part  of  the  function of <b>pnmquant</b> (which was derived from the much older <b>ppmquant</b>).  Color quantization
       really has two main subfunctions, so Netpbm 9.23 split it out into two separate programs: <b>pnmcolormap</b> and
       <b>pnmremap</b> and then Netpbm 9.24 replaced  <b>pnmquant</b>  with  a  program  that  simply  calls  <b>pnmcolormap</b>  and
       <b>pnmremap</b>.
