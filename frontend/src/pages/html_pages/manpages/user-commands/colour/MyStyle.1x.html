       <b>MyStyle</b> - defines combination of color, font, style, background to be used together

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       BackColor <u>color</u>

              Specifies  the  background color associated with this style. <u>color</u> is a color definition in one of
              the color formats supported by AfterStep.

              BackColor is also used to calculate bevel colors used to draw a border around a widget.

       BackGradient <u>type</u>  <u>from</u>  <u>to</u>

              Specifies that a gradient should be used as a background instead of a solid  color.  The  gradient
              colors  start  at  <u>from</u>  and  end at <u>to</u> . <u>from</u> and <u>to</u> are color definition in one of the supported
              color formats . If gradient includes at least one transparent color ( alpha value set to be  below
              FF ), gradient will be alpha-blended over the root background image. <u>type</u> can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5:

              1: Wharf-style diagonal gradient 2: Horizontal from top to bottom 3: Horizontal from top/bottom to
              center  4: Vertical from left to right 5: Vertical from left/right to center 6: Top-Left to Bottom
              Right diagonal ( same as 1 ) 7: Bottom-Left to Top-Right diagonal 8: Vertical Top to Bottom ( same
              as 2 ) 9: Horizontal Left to Right ( same as 4 )

       BackMultiGradient <u>type</u>  <u>offset1</u>  <u>color1</u> ... <u>offsetN</u>  <u>colorN</u>

              Specifies that a gradient should be used as a background instead of a solid  color.  The  gradient
              colors start at <u>color1</u> and end at <u>colorN</u> . Each color has an <u>offset</u> associated with it. The <u>offset</u>
              is  a number between 0.0 and 1.0, and specifies where in the gradient the colors are to be placed.
              The colors are in one of the color formats supported by AfterStep. At least  two  colors  must  be
              given.  If  gradient  includes  at least one transparent color ( alpha value set to be below FF ),
              gradient will be alpha-blended over the root background  image.  The  offsets  are  non-decreasing
              numbers  between  0.0  and 1.0. If the first offset is not 0.0, it will be set to 0.0. If the last
              offset is not 1.0, it will be set to 1.0. <u>type</u> may be any of the following:

              6: Top-Left to Bottom Right diagonal 7: Bottom-Left to  Top-Right  diagonal  8:  Vertical  Top  to
              Bottom 9: Horizontal Left to Right

       BackPixmap <u>type</u>  <u>pixmap_name|color_name</u>

              Specifies  that  a pixmap should be used as a background instead of a solid color. This option has
              two forms, depending on the value of <u>type</u> :

              If <u>type</u> is 125, 126, 127, 128, 130-144, 150-164 - the second parameter, <u>pixmap_name</u>  must  be  the
              name of an image file which can be found in <u>PixmapPath</u> .

              If  <u>type</u>  is 129 or 149 the root pixmap (desktop background) will be used, and the optional second
              parameter must be a color with which the root pixmap will be shaded/tinted.

              Depending on the value of <u>type</u> AfterStep will render pixmap in many different ways :

       125    Image is SCALED to the size of the widget, and its opacity  is  used  to  set  the  shape  of  the
              widget/window decoration, achieving non-rectangular window effect.

       126    Image  is  TILED  to  the  size  of  the  widget,  and its opacity is used to set the shape of the
              widget/window decoration, achieving non-rectangular window effect.

       127    Image is SCALED to the size of the widget.

       128    Image is Tiled to the size of the image.

       129    Underlying desktop background is tinted/shaded with the color specified with the second parameter.

       130    Underlying desktop background is combined with  tiled  image,  using  "allanon"  method  -  taking
              average of pixel values.

       131    Underlying desktop background is alpha-blended with tiled image.

       132    Underlying desktop background is tinted using pixel values of the tiled image, as a tint values on
              per-pixel basis.

       133    Each pixel of underlying desktop background has value of tiled image's pixel added to it.

       134    Each pixel of underlying desktop background has value of tiled image's pixel subtracted from it.

       135    Result  consists  of  pixels  representing absolute value of difference between underlying desktop
              background and tiled image.

       136    Underlying desktop background is darkened using luminocity of the tiled image's pixels.

       137    Underlying desktop background is lightened using luminocity of the tiled image's pixels.

       138    Underlying desktop background is "screened" by the tiled image.

       139    Underlying desktop background is "overlayed" by the tiled image.

       140    Underlying desktop background's hue is substituted with the hue of the tiled image.

       141    Underlying desktop background's saturation is substituted with the saturation of the tiled image.

       142    Underlying desktop background's value (in HSV colorspace) is substituted with  the  value  of  the
              tiled image.

       143    Underlying desktop background is "colorized" by the tiled image.

       144    Underlying desktop background is "dissipated" by the tiled image.

       149    Underlying desktop background is tinted/shaded with the color specified with the second parameter.
              It  differs  from  129  so  that desktop background could be both darkened and brightened. If tint
              color channel is greater the 7F (127 decimal) - then respective  channel  of  background  will  be
              brightened.

       150 - 164
              Same as 130-144 but specified image is scaled to the size of the widget.

       BlurSize

              FIXME: add proper description here.

       DrawTextBackground [ <u>0|1</u> ]

              Specifies  that  the  area  behind  text  drawn in this style should be cleared to <u>BackColor</u> . The
              argument is optional. If the argument is 0, this option is turned off; if  it  is  omitted  or  is
              nonzero, the option is turned on.

       Font <u>font</u>

              Specifies  the  font  associated  with  this  style.  <u>font</u>  copuld  beeither  a  standard X11 font
              definition, or a filename of the TrueType font that could be found in  FontPath.  To  specify  the
              size of the TrueType font - use format like that : FontName.ttf-Size.

              Example :
                   Font  DefaultSans.ttf-14

       ForeColor <u>color</u>

              Specifies the text color associated with this style. <u>color</u> is color definition in one of the color
              formats supported by AfterStep.

       Inherit " <u>style_name</u> "

              Specifies  a  <u>MyStyle</u>  to  inherit  options from. Options from <u>style_name</u> will override previously
              specified options for this style. <u>Inherit</u> is a good way to save memory and  network  bandwidth  if
              the  same  <u>BackPixmap</u>  is  used  for  several  styles,  as  the pixmap will only be loaded for the
              inherited style.

       MyStyle " <u>style_name</u> "

                <u>style_option</u>

       ~MyStyle

              Specifies the beginning of a look style  definition.  The  style  can  be  referred  to  later  by
              <u>style_name</u> . <u>~MyStyle</u> ends a look style definition.

       Overlay

              FIXME: add proper description here.

       SliceXEnd <u>val</u>

              When  used with scalable BackPixmap it will make image sliced instead scaled. Which means that its
              borders will remain unchanged, but center part will get tiled to fill empty  space.  SliceXEnd  is
              the left edge of the right border.

       SliceXStart <u>val</u>

              When  used with scalable BackPixmap it will make image sliced instead scaled. Which means that its
              borders will remain unchanged, but center part will get tiled to fill empty space. SliceXStart  is
              the width of the left border.

       SliceYEnd <u>val</u>

              When  used with scalable BackPixmap it will make image sliced instead scaled. Which means that its
              borders will remain unchanged, but center part will get tiled to fill empty  space.  SliceYEnd  is
              the top edge of the bottom border.

       SliceYStart <u>val</u>

              When  used with scalable BackPixmap it will make image sliced instead scaled. Which means that its
              borders will remain unchanged, but center part will get tiled to fill empty space. SliceYStart  is
              the height of the top border.

       TextStyle <u>style</u>

              Specifies the text <u>style</u> associated with this style. <u>style</u> can be 0, 1, or 2:

              0:  normal text 1: embossed 3D text 2: sunken 3D text 3: text has shade above the text 4: text has
              shade below the text 5: thick embossed 3D text 6: thick sunken 3D text 7: text  is  outlined  with
              contrasting  color on upper edge of a glyph.  8: text is outlined with contrasting color on bottom
              edge of a glyph.  9: text is outlined with contrasting color all around a glyph.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MyStyle 's are the means to define how widgets (menu items, titlebars,  wharf  buttons,  Pager  desktops,
       etc.  )  should be rendered. It defines widget's background (solid color, gradient, textured image and/or
       semitransparent texture), shape - making widget non-rectangular,  text  font,  text  3D  style,  widget's
       border bevel colors.

       All  the  GUI  elements  are  rendered  using  consistent  approach in every module and every part of the
       AfterStep. Interface is build from so called TBars. TBar is rectangular area that may be focused(hilited)
       or unfocused and pressed or unpressed.  TBAR STRUCTURE Each TBar has the following structure :

       - the background of the TBar, which is defined by MyStyle and state of the bar - there are  two  MyStyles
       assigned to each TBar - one for focused and one for unfocused state.

       -  tiles of the TBar. Tiles are smaller features that gets arranged inside the bar according to its size,
       alignment, position and order. Tiles could be static icons ( cannot be pressed );  blocks  of  buttons  -
       each  having  two  shapes  - pressed and normal; Text labels; Empty space tiles. There could be up to 256
       tiles, each residing on one of the cells in 8x8 grid. Several tiles could reside in single cell, in which
       case they get superimposed on top of each other.

       - bevel of the TBar. When TBar is rendered all of its tiles are superimposed on top  of  its  background,
       and  resulting  image  will  have  a  3D  bevel  drawn  on it, using colors from same MyStyle as used for
       background. Bevel could be switched off partially or entirely. Respective configuration options has  been
       added  where  appropriate.  When  TBar  is  pressed - its bevel is inverted.  TBAR RENDERING When TBar is
       rendered all of its elements gets superimposed on top of each other using  one  of  13  blending  methods
       supported  by  libAfterImage, with default being simple alphablending. See MyFrame configuration for more
       details. This is refrred to as "Composition Method".
