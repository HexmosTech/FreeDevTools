</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>ppmcie</b>  creates a PPM file containing a plot of the CIE "tongue" color chart -- to the extent possible in
       a PPM image.  Alternatively, creates a pseudo-PPM image of the color tongue using RGB values from a color
       system of your choice.

       The CIE color tongue is an image of  all  the  hues  that  can  be  described  by  CIE  X-Y  chromaticity
       coordinates.   They  are  arranged  on  a two dimensional coordinate plane with the X chromaticity on the
       horizontal axis and the Y chromaticity on the vertical scale.  (You can choose alternatively to  use  CIE
       u'-v' chromaticity coordinates, but the general idea of the color tongue is the same).

       Note  that  the  PPM  format  specifies that the RGB values in the file are from the ITU-R Recommendation
       BT.709 color system, gamma-corrected.  And positive.  See <b><a href="../man1/ppm.1.html">ppm</a></b>(1) for details.  If  you  use  one  of  the
       color  system  options  on  <b>ppmcie</b>,  what  you  get is not a true PPM image, but is very similar.  If you
       display such <b>ppmcie</b> output using a device that expects PPM input (which includes just about any  computer
       graphics display program), it will display the wrong colors.

       However, you may have a device that expects one of these variations on PPM.

       In  every RGB color system you can specify, including the default (which produces a true PPM image) there
       are hues in the color tongue that can't be represented.  For example,  monochromatic  blue-green  with  a
       wavelength of 500nm cannot be represented in a PPM image.

       For  these  hues,  <b>ppmcie</b>  substitutes a similar hue as follows: They are desaturated and rendered as the
       shade where the edge of the Maxwell triangle intersects a line drawn from  the  requested  shade  to  the
       white point defined by the color system's white point.  Furthermore, unless you specify the <b>-full</b> option,
       <b>ppmcie</b> reduces their intensity by 25% compared to the true hues in the image.

       <b>ppmcie</b> draws and labels the CIE X-Y coordinate axes unless you choose otherwise with options.

       <b>ppmcie</b>  draws the Maxwell triangle for the color system in use on the color tongue.  The Maxwell triangle
       is the triangle whose vertices are the primary illuminant hues for the color system.  The hues inside the
       triangle show the color gamut for the color system.  They are also the only ones that are correct for the
       CIE X-Y chromaticity coordinates shown.  (See explanation above).  <b>ppmcie</b> denotes the Maxwell triangle by
       rendering it at full brightness, while rendering the rest of the color tongue as 3/4 brightness.  You can
       turn this off with options.

       <b>ppmcie</b> also places a black cross at the color system's white point (with the center of the cross open  so
       you  can  actually  see  the  white color) and displays in text the CIE X-Y chromaticities of the primary
       illuminants and white point for the color system.  You can turn this off with options, though.

       <b>ppmcie</b> annotates  the  periphery  of  the  color  tongue  with  the  wavelength,  in  nanometers  of  the
       monochromatic hues which appear there.

       <b>ppmcie</b>  displays  the black body chromaticity curve for Planckian radiators from 1000 to 30000 kelvins on
       the image.  This curve traces the colors of black bodies as various temperatures.

       You can choose from several standard color systems, or specify one of your own numerically.

       CIE charts, by their very nature, contain a very large number of colors.  If you're  encoding  the  chart
       for  a  color mapped device or file format, you'll need to use <b>pnmquant</b> or <b>ppmdither</b> to reduce the number
       of colors in the image.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably  <b>-quiet</b>,  see   Common
       Options ), <b>ppmcie</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       You may abbreviate any option to its shortest unique prefix.

       <b>-rec709</b>

       <b>-cie</b>

       <b>-ebu</b>

       <b>-hdtv</b>

       <b>-ntsc</b>

       <b>-smpte</b> Select  a  standard color system whose gamut to plot.  The default is <b>-rec709</b>, which chooses ITU-R
              Recommendation BT.709, gamma-corrected.  This is the only color system for which  <b>ppmcie</b>'s  output
              is a true PPM image.  See explanation above.  <b>-ebu</b> chooses the primaries used in the PAL and SECAM
              broadcasting  standards.   <b>-ntsc</b>  chooses  the primaries specified by the NTSC broadcasting system
              (few modern monitors actually cover this range).  <b>-smpte</b> selects the primaries recommended by  the
              Society  of  Motion  Picture  and  Television Engineers (SMPTE) in standards RP-37 and RP-145, and
              <b>-hdtv</b> uses the much broader <u>HDTV</u> <u>ideal</u> primaries.  <b>-cie</b>  chooses  a  color  system  that  has  the
              largest possible gamut within the spectrum of the chart.  This is the same color system as you get
              with the <b>-cie</b> option to John Walker's <b>cietoppm</b> program.

       <b>-xy</b>    plot CIE 1931 x y chromaticities.  This is the default.

       <b>-upvp</b>  plot  u'  v'  1976 chromaticities rather than CIE 1931 x y chromaticities.  The advantage of u' v'
              coordinates is that equal intervals of distance on the u' v' plane correspond roughly to the eye's
              ability to discriminate colors.

       <b>-red</b> <u>rx</u> <u>ry</u>
              specifies the CIE <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> co-ordinates of the red illuminant of a custom color system and  selects
              the custom system.

       <b>-green</b> <u>gx</u> <u>gy</u>
              specifies the CIE <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> co-ordinates of the green illuminant of the color system and selects the
              custom system.

       <b>-blue</b> <u>bx</u> <u>by</u>
              specifies  the CIE <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> co-ordinates of the blue illuminant of the color system and selects the
              custom system.

       <b>-white</b> <u>wx</u> <u>wy</u>
              specifies the CIE <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> co-ordinates of the white point of the  color  system  and  selects  the
              custom system.

       <b>-size</b> <u>edge</u>
              Create an image of <u>edge</u> by <u>edge</u> pixels.  The default is 512x512.

       <b>-xsize|-width</b> <u>width</u>
              Sets  the  width of the generated image to <u>width</u> pixels.  The default width is 512 pixels.  If the
              height and width of the image are not the same, the CIE diagram will be stretched  in  the  longer
              dimension.

       <b>-ysize|-height</b> <u>height</u>
              Sets  the  height  of the generated image to <u>height</u> pixels.  The default height is 512 pixels.  If
              the height and width of the image are not the same, the CIE  diagram  will  be  stretched  in  the
              longer dimension.

       <b>-noblack</b>
              Don't plot the black body chromaticity curve.

       <b>-nowpoint</b>
              Don't plot the color system's white point.

       <b>-nolabel</b>
              Omit the label.

       <b>-noaxes</b>
              Don't plot axes.

       <b>-full</b>  Plot  the  entire  CIE tongue in full brightness; don't dim the part which is outside the gamut of
              the specified color system (i.e. outside the Maxwell triangle).

</pre><h4><b>INTERPRETATION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>COLOR</b> <b>CHART</b></h4><pre>
       A color spectrum is a linear combination of one or more monochromatic colors.

       A color is a set of color spectra that all look the same to the human eye (and brain).  Actually, for the
       purposes of the definition, we assume the eye has infinite precision, so we can call  two  color  spectra
       different colors even though they're so close a person couldn't possibly tell them apart.

       The  eye  contains  3  kinds  of  color  receptors (cones).  Each has a different response to the various
       monochromatic colors.  One kind responds most strongly to blue,  another  red,  another  green.   Because
       there  are  only  three, many different color spectra will excite the cones at exactly the same level, so
       the eye cannot tell them apart.  All such spectra that excite the cones in the  same  way  are  a  single
       color.

       Each  point  in  the  color  tongue represents a unique color.  But there are an infinite number of color
       spectra in the set that is that color; i.e. an infinite number of color spectra that would  look  to  you
       like this point.  A machine could tell them apart, but you could not.

       Remember  that  the colors outside the highlighted triangle are approximations of the real colors because
       the PPM format cannot represent them (and your display device probably cannot display  them).   That  is,
       unless you're using a variation of PPM and a special display device, as discussed earlier in this manual.

       A color is always relative to some given maximum brightness.  A particular beam of light looks lime green
       if  in  a dim field, but pea green if in a bright field.  An image on a movie screen may look pitch black
       because the projector is not shining any light on it, but when you turn off the projector and look at the
       same spot in room light, the screen looks quite white.  The same light from that spot hit your  eye  with
       the project on as with it off.

       The  chart  shows two dimensions of color.  The third is intensity.  All the colors in the chart have the
       same intensity.  To get all possible colors in the gamut,  Make  copies  of  the  whole  chart  at  every
       intensity between zero and the maximum.

       The  edge  of  the  tongue consists of all the monochromatic colors.  A monochromatic color is one with a
       single wavelength.  I.e. a color that is in a rainbow.  The  numbers  you  see  are  the  wavelengths  in
       nanometers.

       Any  straight  line segment within the tongue contains colors which are linear combinations of two colors
       -- the colors at either end of the line segment.

       Any color in the chart can be created from two other colors (actually, from any of an infinite number  of
       pairs of other colors).

       All the colors within a triangle inside the tongue can be created from a linear combination of the colors
       at the vertices of that triangle.

       Any color in the tongue can be created from at most 3 monochromatic colors.

       The  highlighted  triangle  shows  the  colors  that can be expressed in the tristimulus color system you
       chose.  (ITU-R BT.709 by default).  The corners of the triangle are the 3  primary  illuminants  in  that
       system  (a  certain  red,  green,  and  blue for BT.709).  The edges of the triangle, then, represent the
       colors you can represent with two of the primary illuminants (saturated colors), and the interior  colors
       require all three primary illuminants (are not saturated).

       In the ITU-R BT.709 color system (the default), the white point is defined as D65, which is (and is named
       after) the color of a black body at 6502 kelvins.  Therefore, you should see the temperature curve on the
       image  pass  through  the  white  part  of  the  image, and the cross that marks the white point, at 6502
       kelvins.

       D65 white is supposed to be the color of the sun.  If you have  a  perfect  BT.709  display  device,  you
       should  see  the  color of the sun at the white point cross.  That's an important color, because when you
       look at an object in sunlight, the color that reflects of the object is based on the color  of  sunlight.
       Note  that the sun produces a particular color spectrum, but many other color spectra are the same color,
       and display devices never use the actual color spectrum of the sun.

       The colors at the corners of the triangle have the chromaticities phosphors in a monitor  that  uses  the
       selected  color  system.   Note that in BT.709 they are very close to monochromatic red, green, and blue,
       but not quite.  That's why you can't display even one true color of the rainbow on a video monitor.

       Remember that the chart shows colors of constant intensity, therefore the corners of  the  triangles  are
       not  the full colors of the primary illuminants, but only their chromaticities.  In fact, the illuminants
       typically have different intensities.  In BT.709, the blue primary illuminant is far  more  intense  than
       the  green, which is more intense than the red.  Designers did this in order to make an equal combination
       of red, green, and blue generate gray.  I.e.  a combination of full strength red,  full  strength  green,
       and full strength blue BT.709 primary illuminants is D65 white.

       The  tongue  has a sharp straight edge at the bottom because that's the limit of human vision.  There are
       colors below that line, but they involve infrared and ultraviolet light, so you  can't  see  them.   This
       line is called the "line of purples."
