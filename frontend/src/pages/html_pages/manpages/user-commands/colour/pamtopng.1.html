</pre><h4><b>OPTION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Minimum  unique  abbreviation  of  option  is acceptable.  You may use double hyphens instead of a single
       hyphen to denote options.  You may use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name
       from its value.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pamtopng</b> reads a Netpbm image as input and produces a PNG image as output.

       Color component values in PNG files are either 8 or 16 bits wide,  so  where  necessary  <b>pamtopng</b>  scales
       colors  to  have  a  maxval  of  255  or 65535.  In that case, it will add an sBIT chunk to indicated the
       original bit-depth.

       <b>pamtopng</b> works only on images with maxval 1, 3, 15, 255, or 65535.  You can use <b>pamdepth</b>  to  convert  an
       image with some other maxval to one of these.

       <b>pamtopng</b>  produces a color PNG from a color PAM, even if the only colors in the image are shades of gray.
       To create a graycale PNG, from such an image (which might be slightly smaller), you can use other  Netpbm
       programs to convert the input to grayscale.

   <b>Alternative:</b> <b>pnmtopng</b>
       Netpbm  contains another program for generating PNG images: <b>pnmtopng</b>.  <b>pnmtopng</b> is a much older program -
       it is in fact the first program in the world that could generate a PNG.  <b>pnmtopng</b> is a complex,  feature-
       laden program.  It lets you control various arcane aspects of the conversion and create PNGs with various
       arcane  features.   It  does  various  transformations  on  the  image to create the greatest compression
       possible, to a degree that probably doesn't make any difference in the modern world.

       The main advantage <b>pamtopng</b> has over <b>pnmtopng</b> is that the former can use the transparency  channel  of  a
       PAM  image  to  generate  the  transparency  information  in the PNG.  In contrast, handling of the alpha
       channel is very cumbersome with <b>pnmtopng</b>.

       One difference that <u>does</u> <u>not</u> exist, that some people might incorrectly  infer  from  the  names,  is  the
       possible input formats.  Both programs can take PBM, PGM, PPM, and PAM input.

       Because <b>pnmtopng</b> has been around virtually forever, programs and procedures that use it are more portable
       than those that use <b>pamtopng</b>.  Its age and popularity also probably make it have fewer bugs.

       <b>pamtopng</b> does not have any way to do what the following do in <b>pnmtopng</b>:

       •      <b>-palette</b>

       •      <b>-history</b>

       •      <b>-filter</b>

       •      <b>-size</b>

       •      <b>-paeth</b>

       •      <b>-hist</b>

       •      <b>-nofilter</b>

       •      <b>-sub</b>

       •      <b>-up</b>

       •      <b>-avg</b>

       •      <b>-force</b>

       •      <b>-libversion</b>

       •      <b>-compression</b>

       •      <b>-comp_</b><u>xxx</u>

       These are some of the other functions of <b>pnmtopng</b> that <b>pamtopng</b> lacks:

       •      When  you  specify  a  transparent  or  background  color  that  is not in the image, <b>pnmtopng</b> can
              optionally choose the closest one that is in the image.  <b>pamtopng</b> always uses the exact color  you
              specify.

       Features  that  exist  in both programs are controlled by largely the same command syntax.  But there are
       these differences:

       •      <b>pnmtopng</b>'s <b>-rgb</b> option is <b>-chroma</b> in <b>pamtopng</b>.  <b>-chroma</b> is a better name, and in fact was the name
              that <b>pnmtopng</b> used originally, but we had to change it when we had to change  the  syntax  of  the
              option value to conform to the rest of Netpbm.

       •      <b>pnmtopng</b>'s  <b>-modtime</b>  option is <b>-time</b> in <b>pamtopng</b>.  The origin of <b>-modtime</b> is analogous to that of
              <b>-rgb</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably  <b>-quiet</b>,  see   Common
       Options ), <b>pamtopng</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       <b>-transparent=</b><u>color</u>
              <b>pamtopng</b> marks the specified color as transparent in the PNG image -- Every pixel of this color is
              fully  transparent.   This  causes  <b>pamtopng</b> to include a tRNS chunk in the image identifying that
              color.

              Specify the color (<u>color</u>) as described for the argument of the <b>pnm_parsecolor()</b> library routine  .
              E.g. <b>red</b> or <b>rgb:ff/00/0d</b>.

       <b>-background=</b><u>color</u>
              This  causes  <b>pamtopng</b>  to create a background color chunk in the PNG output which can be used for
              subsequent transparency channel or transparent color conversions.  Specify <u>color</u> the same  as  for
              <b>-transparent</b>.

       <b>-gamma=</b><u>value</u>
              This causes <b>pamtopng</b> to create a gAMA chunk.  This information helps describe how the color values
              in the PNG must be interpreted.  Without the gAMA chunk, whatever interprets the PNG must get this
              information  separately  (or  just assume something standard).  If your input is a true PPM or PGM
              image, you should specify <b>-gamma=.45</b>.  But sometimes people generate images which  are  ostensibly
              PPM  except  the image uses a different gamma transfer function than the one specified for PPM.  A
              common case of this is when the image is created by simple  hardware  that  doesn't  have  digital
              computational  ability.  Also, some simple programs that generate images from scratch do it with a
              gamma transfer in which the gamma value is 1.0.

       <b>-chroma=</b><u>chroma_list</u>
              This option specifies how red, green, and blue component values of a pixel  specify  a  particular
              color,  by  telling  the  chromaticities  of  those  3 primary illuminants and of white (i.e. full
              strength of all three).

              The <u>chroma_list</u> value is a blank-separated list of 8 floating point decimal numbers: the  CIE-1931
              X and Y chromaticities (in that order) of each of white, red, green, and blue, in that order.

              This information goes into the PNG's cHRM chunk.

              In a shell command, make sure you use quotation marks so that the blanks in <u>chroma_list</u> don't make
              the shell see multiple command arguments.

       <b>-srgbintent=</b><u>intent</u>
              This  asserts  that  the input is a pseudo-Netpbm image that uses an sRGB color space (unlike true
              Netpbm) and indicates how you intend for the colors to be rendered.  It causes <b>pamtopng</b> to include
              an sRGB chunk in the PNG image that specifies that intent, so see the PNG documentation  for  more
              information on what this really means.

              <u>intent</u> is one of:

       •      <b>perceptual</b>

       •      <b>relativecolorimetric</b>

       •      <b>saturation</b>

       •      <b>absolutecolorimetric</b>

       <b>-text=</b><u>filename</u>
              This option lets you include arbitrary text strings in the PNG output, as tEXt chunks.

              <u>filename</u> is the name of a file that contains your text strings.

              The output contains a distinct tEXt chunk for each entry in the file.

              Here is an example of a text string file:

                   Title           PNG file
                   Author          John Doe
                   Description     how to include a text chunk
                                      PNG file
                   "Creation Date" 2015-may-11
                   Software        pamtopng

              The file is divided into entries, each entry comprising consecutive lines of text.  The first line
              of  an entry starts in the first column (i.e. the first column is not white space) and every other
              line has white space in the first column.  The first entry starts in the first line, so it is  not
              valid for the first line of the file to have white space in its first column.

              The  first word in an entry is the key of the text string (e.g. 'Title').  It begins in column one
              of the line and continues up to, but not including, the first delimiter character or  the  end  of
              the  line, whichever is first.  You can enclose the key in double quotes in which case the key can
              consists of multiple words.  The quotes are not part of the key.  The text string  per  se  begins
              after  the  key  and  any  delimiter characters after it, plus the text in subsequent continuation
              lines.

              There is no limit on the length of a file line or entry or key or text string.  There is no  limit
              on the number of entries.

       <b>-ztxt=</b><u>filename</u>
              The  same  as  <b>-text</b>,  except the text string is compressed in the PNG output.  <b>pamtopng</b> uses zTXt
              chunks instead of a tEXt chunks.

       <b>-itxt=</b><u>filename</u>
              Similar to <b>-text</b>, but the text strings can be in a language other than  English.   The  PNG  image
              indicates  what  language  that  is  and  includes  the  text  string key both in English and that
              language.  <b>pamtopng</b> uses iTXt chunks instead of tEXt chunks.

              For each record, you must specify the language and give the key both in English and  in  the  text
              string language.

              Example:

                   Language        nl-NL  Taal             nl-NL
                      Title           nl-NL  Titel            PNG file
                      Author          nl-NL  Auteur           Pietje Puk
                      Description     nl-NL  Omschrijving     Tekst in het Nederlands.

              The     language     specification    is    based    on    the    ISO    639-1    standard,    see
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes</a> for the valid codes.  The format is either  a
              two character "nl" or an extended code like "en-US".

       <b>-time='</b>[<u>yy</u>]<u>yy-mm-dd</u> <u>hh:mm:ss</u><b>'</b>
              This option allows you to specify the modification time value to be placed in the PNG output.  You
              can specify the year parameter either as a two or four digit value.

       <b>-interlace</b>
              This causes the PNG file to be interlaced, in Adam7 format.  The interlaced format is one in which
              the  raster  data  starts with a low-resolution representation of the entire image, then continues
              with additional information for the entire image, then even more information, etc.   In  Adam7  in
              particular, there are seven such passes of the whole image.  This is useful when you are receiving
              the  image  over a slow communication line as someone is waiting to see it.  The simplest thing to
              do in that case is wait for the entire image to arrive and then display it instantly, but then the
              user is wasting time staring at a blank space until the whole image arrives.   With  the  standard
              non-interlaced  format,  the  data  arrives row-by-row starting at the top, so the displayer could
              display each row of the image as it arrives and gradually paint down to the bottom.  But  with  an
              interlaced  image,  the displayer can start by showing a low-resolution version of the image, then
              gradually improve the display as more data arrives.

              When you specify this option, <b>pamtopng</b> must hold the entire  image  in  memory  at  once,  whereas
              without  it, the program holds only one raster row at a time.  If you don't have enough memory for
              that, you might suffer extreme slowdowns or failure - not just in the  process  running  <b>pamtopng</b>,
              but  potentially  throughout  the  system that shares memory with it.  <b>pnmtopng</b> does not have this
              limitation (it holds only one row at a time in memory even when generating an interlaced PNG).

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.86 (March 2019).

       <b>-verbose</b>
              This causes the program to display various facts about the conversion.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pamtopng</b> was new in Netpbm 10.70 (June 2015).

       Before  <b>pamtopng</b>,  the  two  ways  to  create PNG images with Netpbm were <b>pnmtopng</b> and <b>pamrgbatopng</b>.  The
       history of the former is discussed above.  The latter was added to Netpbm in 2005 as a cheap way to  fill
       a  significant  need that <b>pnmtopng</b> did not: the ability to turn the alpha channel in a PAM image into the
       alpha channel in a PNG image.

       Handling of the alpha channel with <b>pnmtopng</b> is very cumbersome (as was dealing  with  alpha  channels  in
       general  before  the  introduction of the PAM format).  <b>pamrgbatopng</b> could do what people wanted with the
       alpha channel, but nothing else.  It was a very small program with literally no command line options.

       The goal in those days was eventually to expand <b>pnmtopng</b> to do the PAM alpha channel thing, rename it  to
       <b>pamtopng</b>, and retire <b>pamrgbatopng</b>.  But <b>pnmtopng</b> is such a complex program, because of its dizzying array
       of features and its need for backward compatibility, that adding that one capability to it was a daunting
       task and for ten years nobody attempted it.

       In 2015, one of the authors of the original <b>pnmtopng</b> (from before it was even part of Netpbm -- a program
       that  shared  essentially no lines of code with <b>pnmtopng</b> of 2015) decided to go in a different direction.
       While many features of <b>pnmtopng</b> were pretty important and easy to implement, many others were probably of
       no use in the modern world or at least not important enough to justify the complexity they  lent  to  the
       code.   (The features thought to be outdated were ones that were intended to make the PNG output slightly
       smaller - something considerably less important with the declining cost of computer resources).

       And there was an opportunity to drop those features: We could use the  new  name  'pamtopng'  for  a  new
       program,  keep  the  existing  program  under  the name 'pnmtopng', and avoid most backward compatibility
       trouble.

       Therefore, Willem van Schaik wrote an intermediate level program that had all the most important features
       of <b>pnmtopng</b>, plus the alpha channel handling of <b>pamrgbatopng</b>, with nice, simple code.  That was <b>pamtopng</b>.

       Because <b>pamrgbatopng</b> had no options, <b>pamtopng</b> was  backward  compatible  with  it  without  even  trying.
       Therefore,  as  soon  as  we  added  <b>pamtopng</b>  to  Netpbm,  we  removed <b>pamrgbatopng</b> and recommended that
       <b>pamrgbatopng</b> be installed as an alias for <b>pamtopng</b>.
