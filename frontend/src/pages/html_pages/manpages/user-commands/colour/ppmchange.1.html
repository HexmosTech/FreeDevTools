       ppmchange - change all pixels of one color to another in a PPM image

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ppmchange</b>

       [<b>-closeness=</b><u>closeness_percent</u>] [<b>-remainder=</b><u>remainder_color</u>] [<b>-closeok</b>] [<u>oldcolor</u> <u>newcolor</u>] ...  [<u>ppmfile</u>]

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ppmchange</b> <b>red</b> <b>blue</b> <b>redimage.ppm</b> <b>&gt;blueimage.ppm</b>

       <b>ppmchange</b> <b>red</b> <b>red</b> <b>-remainder=black</b> <b>myimage.ppm</b> <b>&gt;redblack.ppm</b>

       <b>ppmchange</b> <b>-closeness=10</b> <b>white</b> <b>white</b> <b>black</b> <b>black</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>ppmchange</b> reads a PPM image as input and changes all pixels of color <u>oldcolor</u> to color <u>newcolor</u>.

       You  may  specify up to 256 oldcolor/newcolor pairs on the command line.  <b>ppmchange</b> leaves all colors not
       mentioned unchanged, unless you specify the <b>-remainder</b> option, in which case they are all changed to  the
       single specified color.

       You  can  specify  that  colors  similar,  but  not  identical,  to  the ones you specify get replaced by
       specifying a "closeness" factor.

       Specify the colors as described for the argument of the <b>pnm_parsecolor()</b> library routine .

       If a pixel matches two different <u>oldcolor</u>s, <b>ppmchange</b> replaces it  with  the  <u>newcolor</u>  of  the  leftmost
       specified one.

       The  maxval of the output image is the same as that of the input image.  If a <u>newcolor</u> you specify cannot
       be exactly represented in that maxval, <b>ppmchange</b> assumes a color that is as close as possible to what you
       specified but can be represented with your maxval.  Unless you specify  the  <b>-closeok</b>  option,  <b>ppmchange</b>
       issues a warning that it is using an approximation.

       A  common  way  that  you can have this maxval problem, where the color you specify cannot be represented
       with your maxval, is that your input is a PBM (black and white)  image  that  you  are  colorizing.   The
       maxval  in  this  case  is  1,  which  severely limits the colors to which you can change.  To avoid this
       problem, use <b>pamdepth</b> to make the maxval of your input something consistent with  your  colors.   255  is
       usually a good choice.

       Before  Netpbm  10.22 (April 2004), <b>ppmchange</b> always behaved as if the user specified <b>-closeok</b>, and there
       was no <b>-closeok</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably  <b>-quiet</b>,  see   Common
       Options ), <b>ppmchange</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       <b>-closeness</b> <u>closeness_percent</u>
              <u>closeness</u>  is  a percentage indicating how close to the color you specified a pixel must be to get
              replaced.  By default, it is 0, which means the pixel must be the exact color you specified.

              A pixel gets replaced if the distance in color between it and the color you specified is less than
              or equal to <u>closeness</u> per cent of the maxval.

              The "distance" in color is defined as the Cartesian sum of  the  individual  differences  in  red,
              green,  and  blue  intensities  between  the two pixels, normalized so that the difference between
              black and white is 100%.

              This is probably simpler than what you want most the time.  You  probably  would  like  to  change
              colors  that  have  similar  chrominance, regardless of their intensity.  So if there's a red barn
              that is variously shadowed,  you  want  the  entire  barn  changed.   But  because  the  shadowing
              significantly  changes  the color according to <b>ppmchange</b>'s distance formula, parts of the barn are
              probably about as distant in color from other parts of the barn as they are from green grass  next
              to the barn.

              Maybe <b>ppmchange</b> will be enhanced some day to do chrominance analysis.

              This option was new in Netpbm 9.8 (September 2000).

       <b>-closeok</b>
              This  option  affects  how  <b>ppmchange</b>  interprets  a color you specify in the arguments.  When you
              specify this option, <b>ppmchange</b> may use a color close to, but not the same  as  what  you  specify.
              See the description section  for details.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.22 (April 2004).  Before that, <b>ppmchange</b> always behaved as if you
              specified this option.

       <b>-remainder</b> <u>color</u>
              <b>ppmchange</b>  changes  all  pixels  which  are  not  of  a  color  for  which you specify an explicit
              replacement color on the command line to color <u>color</u>.

              An example application of this is

              <b>ppmchange</b> <b>-remainder=black</b> <b>red</b> <b>red</b>

              to lift only the red portions from an image, or
              <b>ppmchange</b> <b>-remainder=black</b> <b>red</b> <b>white</b> <b>|</b> <b>ppmtopgm</b>

              to create a mask file for the red portions of the image.
