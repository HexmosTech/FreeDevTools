       warg - inference of homologous recombination in bacteria using whole genome sequences

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>warg</b> [OPTIONS] treefile datafile outputfile

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Bacteria,  unlike  us,  can  reproduce  on  their own.  They do however have mechanisms that transfer DNA
       between organisms, a process more formally known as recombination.  The mechanisms by which recombination
       takes place have been studied extensively in the laboratory but much remains to be understood  concerning
       how,  when  and  where  recombination takes place within natural populations of bacteria and how it helps
       them to adapt to new environments.  ClonalOrigin performs a comparative analysis of the  sequences  of  a
       sample  of  bacterial  genomes  in order to reconstruct the recombination events that have taken place in
       their ancestry.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-w</b> NUM Sets the number of pre burn-in iterations (default is 100000)

       <b>-x</b> NUM Sets the number of burn-in iterations (default is 100000)

       <b>-y</b> NUM Sets the number of iterations after burn-in (default is 100000)

       <b>-z</b> NUM Sets the number of iterations between samples (default is 100)

       <b>-T</b> NUM Sets the value of theta. Use sNUM instead of NUM for per-site

       <b>-R</b> NUM Sets the value of rho. Use sNUM instead of NUM for per-site

       <b>-D</b> NUM Sets the value of delta

       <b>-s</b> NUM Use given seed to initiate random number generator

       <b>-S</b> NUM,SEED
              Run on a subset of NUM regions determined by seed SEED

              NUM/NUM/../NUM Run on a specified region(s) given by each NUM.

       <b>-r</b> NUM Perform r tempered steps between topological updates (default:0)

       <b>-t</b> NUM Tempered at "temperature" t for topological updates (default:1.0)

       <b>-U</b>     Start from UPGMA tree, rather than the default random tree.

       <b>-G</b> NUM Greedily compute the "best fit" tree, given the recombination observed on the  current  tree.   If
              NUM  is  negative and a previous run is provided, the tree is calculated from all observed values.
              If NUM is positive, a "greedy move" is performed with weight NUM (see <b>-a</b>).  Note that this is  NOT
              an MCMC move and causes bias.

       <b>-a</b> NUM,...,NUM
              Set  the  ELEVEN  (real  valued) move weightings to the given vector, with weightings separated by
              commas (NOT SPACES).  The weightings need not sum to 1, but must be in the following order:

              MoveRho (ignored if not needed)

              MoveDelta (ignored if not needed)

              MoveTheta (ignored if not needed)

              MoveRemEdge

              MoveAddEdge

              MoveSiteChange

              MoveTimeChange

              MoveEdgeChange

              MoveAgeClonal

              MoveScaleTree

              MoveRegraftClonal

       <b>-i</b> NUM,...,NUM
              Set the SIX parameters for creating random Recombination Trees under  the  inference  model.   The
              parameters are:

              N (integer)       The number of sequences in the sample (default 10)

              n_B (integer)       The number of block boundaries in the sample (default 8)

              l_B (integer)       The length of each block: L=n_B * l_B (default 500)

              delta (real)          The average length of imports (default 500.0)

              theta (real)          The mutation rate NOT per site (default 100.0)

              rho (real)          The recombination rate NOT per site (default 50.0)

       <b>-f</b>     Forbid topology changes, (allowing updates of coalescence times).

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose mode

       <b>-h</b>     This help message

       <b>-V</b>     Print Version info
