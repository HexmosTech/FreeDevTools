</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       vpcs - Virtual PC Simulator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vpcs</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>scriptfile</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       VPCS provides a command line interface to nine simulated virtual PCs.  You can ping/trace route from/to
       them, or ping/trace route other hosts/routers from the virtual PCs, making it an ideal study tool when
       you simulate Cisco or Juniper routers in a Dynamips or GNS3 environment.

       Virtual PCs are able to generate and respond to ICMP (ping), TCP and UDP packets delivered to the
       application via a UDP pipe or Unix tap interface.  If <u>scriptfile</u> is specified, then vpcs reads the file
       on start-up and executes the commands in the scriptfile.  <u>scriptfile</u> must be in <b>vpcs</b> <b>script</b> <b>file</b> <b>format</b>.

       <b>vpcs</b> listens for messages on nine consecutive UDP ports and sends messages on nine consecutive UDP ports.
       By the default, <b>vpcs</b> listens on UDP ports 20000 to 20008 and sends messages on UDP ports 30000 to 30008.
       Each UDP port pair (20000/30000, 20001/30001...20008/30008) represents a virtual PC.  Virtual PCs are
       numbered 1 to 9.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print the command line options and exit

       <b>-v</b>     Print the version information and exit

       <b>-i</b> <u>num</u> number of vpc instances to start (default is 9)

       [<b>-r</b>] <u>scriptfile</u>
              If  <u>scriptfile</u> is specified, then <b>vpcs</b> reads the file on start-up and executes the commands in the
              <u>scriptfile</u>.  <u>scriptfile</u>  must be in <b>vpcs</b>  script  file  format.   By  default,  if  a  file  named
              <b>startup.vpc</b>  exists  in  the  directory  where  the  <b>vpcs</b> program was started, it will be read and
              executed when <b>vpcs</b> starts.  The <b>-r</b> option is optional if <u>scriptfile</u> is the last parameter.

       <b>-p</b> <u>port</u>
              Run <b>vpcs</b> as a daemon process listening on TCP port specified by <u>port</u>.  As a daemon  process,  <b>vpcs</b>
              does  not  present  a  command  line  interface to the user, but the command line interface can be
              accessed remotely using a TCP stream application such as <u>telnet</u> or netcat (<u>nc</u>).  Once  the  daemon
              has been started, there is no internal mechanism for terminating the program, and the program must
              be  terminated by sending a system signal 9, typically by using the command <b>kill</b> <b>-9</b> <b>PID</b> (where PID
              is the process id of the vpcs instance)

       <b>-m</b> <u>num</u> <b>vpcs</b> uses 9 consecutive MAC addresses for the 9 <u>vpcs</u> stating at 00:50:79:66:68:00 by default.  The
              <b>-m</b>  option adds <u>num</u> to the last byte of the base MAC address.  Should any increment cause the last
              byte exceed 0xFF during this process, it will increment to 0x00.

       <b>-e</b>     On systems that support the <b>/dev/tapx</b> interface (Unix/Linux), run <b>vpcs</b> in tap mode rather than UDP
              mode.  In tap mode, IP packets are sent and received via /dev/tapx interfaces rather than via  UDP
              streams.   Typically  /dev/tapx interfaces are only available to the root user, meaning <b>vpcs</b> would
              also be required to be run by the root user (<b>sudo</b> <b>vpcs</b> <b>-e</b>) to use tap mode.

       [<b>-u</b>]   This option is the default and not necessary, but included to contrast with  the  <b>-e</b>  option.   By
              default,  <b>vpcs</b>  sends and receives IP packets to and from specified UDP ports. <b>vpcs</b> listens on UDP
              port 20000 and sends to port 127.0.0.1:30000 by default.  The listening and sending ports  can  be
              manipulated using the <b>-s</b>, <b>-c</b> and <b>-t</b> options.

   <b>UDP</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-s</b> <u>port</u>
              <u>port</u> specifies the base port number that <b>vpcs</b> uses to listen for messages. By default <b>vpcs</b> listens
              for  messages  on  UDP ports <u>20000</u> to <u>20008</u>.  By changing the base port that <b>vpcs</b> listens to using
              the <b>-s</b> option causes nine consecutive UDP ports to be used starting at the port specified by <u>port</u>.

       <b>-t</b> <u>ip</u>  <b>vpcs</b> streams packets to nine UDP ports commencing at <u>127.0.0.1:30000</u> by default.   The  <b>-t</b>  option
              allows  you  to  stream  packets  to  a remote host as specified by IPv4 address <u>ip</u>. Typically the
              remote host will be running dynamips with a cloud connection configured to link to this hostâ€™s  IP
              address.

       <b>-c</b> <u>port</u>
              <b>vpcs</b> streams packets to nine UDP ports commencing at <u>127.0.0.1:30000</u>.  The <b>-c</b> option allows you to
              stream  packets  to  a different set of nine ports commencing at the base port number specified by
              <u>port</u>.

   <b>TAP</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-d</b> <u>device</u>
              Device name, works only when <b>-i</b> is set to 1

   <b>Hypervisor</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>Option</b>
       <b>-H</b> <u>port</u>
              Run as a hypervisor, listening on TCP port specified by <u>port</u>.  In the  hypervisor  mode,  you  can
              connect this control <u>port</u> with <u>telnet</u>, start or stop an instance of <b>vpcs</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>No</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b> <b>options</b>
       If  you  start  the  <b>vpcs</b>  with  no arguments, <u>vpcs</u> will start and look for the script <b>startup.vpc</b> in the
       current directory.  If it exists, it will run the script.  This is the normal way of  running  the  <u>vpcs</u>.
       It is simply envoked from the command line like this:

       <b>vpcs</b>

   <b>Starting</b> <b>vpcs</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>startup</b> <b>file</b>
       To  start   <b>vpcs</b> with a startup script file called say <b>alternate.vpc</b>, use the file name as an argument to
       the <b>vpcs</b> command:

       <b>vpcs</b> <b>alternate.vpc</b>

   <b>Running</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>nine</b> <b>Virtual</b> <b>PCs</b>
       Suppose you needed more than nine Virtual PCs, so you want to run a second instance of <b>vpcs</b> on your local
       host.  You would have to consider:

       1. The VPCs MAC addresses for the second instance would need to be different,

       2. The "local" or listening UDP port numbers for the second instance would have to differ from the  first
       instance.

       3. The remote UDP port numbers for the second instance would have to differ from the first instance.

       Since  the default local listening port is 20000, and the default remote port is 30000, you would want to
       start <b>vpcs</b> with a local listening port of 20009 (or greater) and remote port of 30009 (or greater) .  You
       would also want the base MAC address to be offset by at least nine to avoid any clashes.   In  this  case
       you would use the command:

       <b>vpcs</b> <b>-s</b> <b>20009</b> <b>-c</b> <b>30009</b> <b>-m</b> <b>9</b>

   <b>Running</b> <b>two</b> <b>instances</b> <b>of</b> <b>vpcs</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>host</b>
       Suppose  you  wanted  to  run  a second instance of <b>vpcs</b> on your local host that can communicate with the
       instance already running with a default configuration.  You would have to consider:

       1. The VPCs MAC addresses for the second instance would need to be different,

       2. The "local" or listening UDP port numbers for the second instance would have  to  match  the  "remote"
       port numbers of the first instance

       3. The remote UDP port numbers would have to match the "local" or listening UDP port numbers of the first
       instance

       Since  the default local listening port is 20000, and the default remote port is 30000, you would want to
       start <b>vpcs</b> with a local listening port of 30000 and remote port of 20000.  You would also want  the  base
       MAC address to be offset by at least nine to avoid any clashes.  In this case you would use the command:

       <b>vpcs</b> <b>-s</b> <b>30000</b> <b>-c</b> <b>20000</b> <b>-m</b> <b>9</b>

</pre><h4><b>BASE</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vpcs</b>  presents  the  user  with  a  command line interface (unless daemon mode has been invoked by the <b>-p</b>
       option). The interface prompt indicates which of the 9 virtual PCs currently has focus by indicating  the
       VPC number in brackets.  Eg.:
       VPCS[1]
       Here  the  digit  1  inside the brackets indcates that VPC 1 has focus, and any traffic generated will be
       sent from VPC 1, and basic <b>show</b> commands will relate to VPC 1.

       Basic commands supported are:

       <b>?</b>                        Print help

       <b>&lt;digit&gt;</b>                  Switch to the VPC&lt;digit&gt;. &lt;digit&gt; range 1 to 9

       <b>arp</b>                      Shortcut for: <b>show</b> <b>arp</b>. Show arp table

       <b>clear</b> [arguments]        Clear IPv4/IPv6, arp/neighbor cache, command history

       <b>dhcp</b> [-options]          Shortcut for: <b>ip</b> <b>dhcp</b>. Get IPv4 address via DHCP

       <b>echo</b> &lt;text&gt;              Display &lt;text&gt; in output

       <b>help</b>                     Print help

       <b>load</b> &lt;filename&gt;          Load the configuration/script from the file &lt;filename&gt;

       <b>ping</b> &lt;host&gt; [-options]   Ping the network &lt;host&gt; with ICMP (default) or TCP/UDP

       <b>quit</b>                     Quit program

       <b>relay</b> [arguments] &lt;port&gt; Relay packets between two UDP port

       <b>rlogin</b> [&lt;ip&gt;] &lt;port&gt;     Telnet to host relative to HOST PC

       <b>save</b> &lt;filename&gt;          Save the configuration to the file &lt;filename&gt;

       <b>set</b> [arguments]          Set VPC name, peer ports, dump options, echo on or off

       <b>show</b> [arguments]         Print the information of VPCs (default). Try <b>show</b> <b>?</b>

       <b>sleep</b> &lt;seconds&gt; [text]   Print &lt;text&gt; and pause the running script for &lt;seconds&gt;

       <b>trace</b> &lt;host&gt; [-options]  Print the path packets take to network &lt;host&gt;

       <b>version</b>                  Shortcut for: <b>show</b> <b>version</b>

   <b>vpcs</b> <b>script</b> <b>file</b> <b>format</b>
       Any text file consisting of valid vpcs commands can be used as a vpcs script file.   Lines  in  the  file
       beginning  with  the  <b>#</b> character will be treated as comments and ignored.  Command files can make use of
       the <b>echo</b> and <b>sleep</b> commands to create some form of interactive script.
       Script file exececution can be aborted at any time by pressing Ctrl+c.  This means that the  <b>ping</b>  <b>&lt;host&gt;</b>
       <b>-t</b> command (which must be terimated by Ctrl+c) is not useful in vpcs script files.

</pre><h4><b>HYPERVISOR</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       commands supported are:

       <b>help</b> <b>|</b> <b>?</b>                 Print help

       <b>vpcs</b> [parameters]        Start <b>vpcs</b> daemon with parameters.

       <b>stop</b> <b>id</b>                  Stop <b>vpcs</b> process

       <b>list</b>                     List <b>vpcs</b> process

       <b>disconnect</b>               Exit the telnet session

       <b>quit</b> [-f]                Stop <b>vpcs</b> processes and hypervisor, <u>-f</u> force quit without prompting

       <b>telnet</b> <b>[&lt;ip&gt;]</b> <b>&lt;port&gt;</b>     Telnet to &lt;port&gt; at &lt;ip&gt; (default 127.0.0.1)

       <b>rlogin</b> <b>[&lt;ip&gt;]</b> <b>&lt;port&gt;</b>     Same as telnet

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       IPv6 implementation is a basic implementation that is not fully implemented.

       The  <b>ping</b>  <b>&lt;host&gt;</b>  <b>-t</b>  command  (which  must be terimated by Ctrl+c) can not be used in vpcs script files
       because when Ctrl+c is pressed to stop the ping, it also aborts the script file execution.
