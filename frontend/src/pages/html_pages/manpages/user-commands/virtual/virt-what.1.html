</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       virt-what - detect if we are running in a virtual machine

</pre><h4><b>SUMMARY</b></h4><pre>
       virt-what [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "virt-what" is a shell script which can be used to detect if the program is running in a virtual machine.

       The program prints out a list of "facts" about the virtual machine, derived from heuristics.  One fact is
       printed per line.

       If nothing is printed and the script exits with code 0 (no error), then it can mean <u>either</u> that the
       program is running on bare-metal <u>or</u> the program is running inside a type of virtual machine which we
       don't know about or cannot detect.

</pre><h4><b>FACTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>alibaba_cloud</b>
       <b>alibaba_cloud-ebm</b>
           This is a cloud computing service based on Alibaba Cloud.

           Status: contributed by Weisson.

       <b>aws</b> Amazon Web Services.

           Note that virt-what will print this fact for baremetal AWS instances, which you might not consider to
           be true virtualization.  In this case other facts (eg. "kvm" or "xen") would <u>not</u> be present.

       <b>virt</b>
           Some sort of virtualization appears to be present, but we are not sure what it is.  In some very rare
           corner  cases where we know that virtualization is hard to detect, we will try a timing attack to see
           if certain machine instructions are running much  more  slowly  than  they  should  be,  which  would
           indicate virtualization.  In this case, the generic fact "virt" is printed.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       Programs that use or wrap "virt-what" should check that the exit status is 0 before they attempt to parse
       the output of the command.

       A  non-zero exit status indicates some error, for example, an unrecognized command line argument.  If the
       exit status is non-zero then the output "facts" (if any were printed) cannot be guaranteed and should  be
       ignored.

       The  exit  status  does <u>not</u> have anything to do with whether the program is running on baremetal or under
       virtualization, nor with whether "virt-what" managed detection "correctly" (which is basically unknowable
       given the large variety of virtualization systems out there and that some  systems  deliberately  emulate
       others).

</pre><h4><b>RUNNING</b> <b>VIRT-WHAT</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b></h4><pre>
       "virt-what" is designed so that you can easily run it from other programs or wrap it up in a library.

       Your program should check the exit status (see the section above).

       Some  programming languages (notably Python: issue 1652) erroneously mask the "SIGPIPE" signal and do not
       restore it when executing subprocesses.  "virt-what" is a shell script and some  shell  commands  do  not
       work correctly when you do this.  You may see warnings from "virt-what" similar to this:

        echo: write error: Broken pipe

       The solution is to set the "SIGPIPE" signal handler back to "SIG_DFL" before running "virt-what".

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTANT</b> <b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       Most  of  the  time, using this program is the <u>wrong</u> thing to do.  Instead you should detect the specific
       features you actually want to use.  (As an example, if you wanted to issue Xen  hypervisor  commands  you
       would look for the "/proc/xen/privcmd" file).

       However people keep asking for this, so we provide it.  There are a few legitimate uses:

       Bug reporting tool
           If  you  think that virtualization could affect how your program runs, then you might use "virt-what"
           to report this in a bug reporting tool.

       Status display and monitoring tools
           You might include this information in status and monitoring programs.

       System tuning (sometimes)
           You might use this program to tune an operating system so it runs better as a virtual  machine  of  a
           particular  hypervisor.   However if installing paravirtualized drivers, it's better to check for the
           specific features your drivers need (eg. for the presence of PCI devices).

           detail as possible.

           Remember  to  include  the  version numbers (step 3) and the debug messages file (step 2) and as much
           other detail as possible.

       5. Assign the bug to rjones @ redhat.com
           Assign or reassign the bug to <b>rjones</b> <b>@</b> <b>redhat.com</b> (without the spaces).  You  can  also  send  me  an
           email with the bug number if you want a faster response.
