</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fftwl-wisdom - create wisdom (pre-optimized FFTs)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fftwl-wisdom</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>SIZE</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>fftwl-wisdom</u>  is  a  utility  to generate FFTW <b>wisdom</b> files, which contain saved information about how to
       optimally compute (Fourier) transforms of various sizes.  FFTW is a  free  library  to  compute  discrete
       Fourier  transforms  in  one  or more dimensions, for arbitrary sizes, and of both real and complex data,
       among other related operations.   More  information  on  FFTW  can  be  found  at  the  FFTW  home  page:
       <u><a href="http://www.fftw.org">http://www.fftw.org</a></u>

       Programs  using  FFTW  can  be  written  to  load wisdom from an arbitrary file, string, or other source.
       Moreover, it is likely that many FFTW-using programs will load the <b>system</b> <b>wisdom</b> file, which is stored in
       <u>/etc/fftw/wisdoml</u> by default.  <u>fftwl-wisdom</u> can be used to create or add to such wisdom  files.   In  its
       most typical usage, the wisdom file can be created to pre-plan a canonical set of sizes (see below) via:

                                             fftwl-wisdom -v -c -o wisdoml

       (this  will  take many hours, which can be limited by the <b>-t</b> option) and the output <u>wisdoml</u> file can then
       be copied (as root) to <u>/etc/fftw/</u> or whatever.

       The <u>fftwl-wisdom</u> program normally writes the wisdom directly to standard output, but this can be  changed
       via the <b>-o</b> option, as in the example above.

       If  the system wisdom file <u>/etc/fftw/wisdoml</u> already exists, then <u>fftwl-wisdom</u> reads this existing wisdom
       (unless the <b>-n</b> option is specified) and outputs both the old wisdom and any  newly  created  wisdom.   In
       this  way, it can be used to add new transform sizes to the existing system wisdom (or other wisdom file,
       with the <b>-w</b> option).

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFYING</b> <b>SIZES</b></h4><pre>
       Although a canonical set of sizes to optimize is specified by the <b>-c</b> option, the user  can  also  specify
       zero  or  more  non-canonical transform sizes and types to optimize, via the <u>SIZE</u> arguments following the
       option flags.  Alternatively, the sizes  to  optimize  can  be  read  from  standard  input  (whitespace-
       separated), if a <u>SIZE</u> argument of "-" is supplied.

       Sizes are specified by the syntax:

                                         &lt;<u>type</u>&gt;&lt;<u>inplace</u>&gt;&lt;<u>direction</u>&gt;&lt;<u>geometry</u>&gt;

       &lt;<u>type</u>&gt;  is  either ´c´ (complex), ´r´ (real, r2c/c2r), or ´k´ (r2r, per-dimension kinds, specified in the
       geometry, below).

       &lt;<u>inplace</u>&gt; is either ´i´ (in place) or ´o´ (out of place).

       &lt;<u>direction</u>&gt; is either ´f´ (forward) or ´b´  (backward).   The  &lt;<u>direction</u>&gt;  should  be  omitted  for  ´k´
       transforms, where it is specified via the geometry instead.

       &lt;<u>geometry</u>&gt;  is  the size and dimensionality of the transform, where different dimensions are separated by
       ´x´ (e.g. ´16x32´ for a two-dimensional 16 by 32 transform).  In the case of ´k´ transforms, the size  of
       each  dimension is followed by a "type" string, which can be one of f/b/h/e00/e01/e10/e11/o00/o01/o10/o11
       for R2HC/HC2R/DHT/REDFT00/.../RODFT11, respectively, as defined in the FFTW manual.

       For example, ´cif12x13x14´ is a  three-dimensional  12  by  13  x  14  complex  DFT  operating  in-place.
       ´rob65536´  is  a one-dimensional size-65536 out-of-place complex-to-real (backwards) transform operating
       on Hermitian-symmetry input.  ´ki10hx20e01´ is a two-dimensional 10 by 20 r2r transform where  the  first
       dimension is a DHT and the second dimension is an REDFT01 (DCT-III).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display help on the command-line options and usage.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print the version number and copyright information.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Verbose  output.   (You can specify this multiple times, or supply a numeric argument greater than
              1, to increase the verbosity level.)  Note that the verbose output will be mixed with  the  wisdom
              output (making it impossible to import), unless you write the wisdom to a file via the <b>-o</b> option.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--canonical</b>
              Optimize/pre-plan  a  canonical  set  of  sizes:  all  powers of two and ten up to 2^20 (1048576),
              including both real and complex, forward and  backwards,  in-place  and  out-of-place  transforms.
              Also includes two- and three-dimensional transforms of equal-size dimensions (e.g. 16x16x16).

       <b>-t</b> <u>hours</u>, <b>--time-limit</b>=<u>hours</u>
              Stop  after a time of <u>hours</u> (hours) has elapsed, outputting accumulated wisdom.  (The problems are
              planned in increasing order of size.)  Defaults to 0, indicating no time limit.

       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--output-file</b>=<u>file</u>
              Send wisdom output to <u>file</u> rather than to standard output (the default).

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--measure</b>; <b>-e</b>, <b>--estimate</b>; <b>-x</b>, <b>--exhaustive</b>
              Normally, <u>fftwl-wisdom</u> creates plans in FFTW_PATIENT mode, but with these options you can  instead
              use  FFTW_MEASURE,  FFTW_ESTIMATE,  or  FFTW_EXHAUSTIVE  modes, respectively, as described in more
              detail by the FFTW manual.

              Note that wisdom is tagged with the planning patience level, and a single file can  mix  different
              levels  of  wisdom  (e.g.  you  can  mostly use the patient default, but plan a few sizes that you
              especially care about in <b>--exhaustive</b> mode).

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-system-wisdom</b>
              Do not import the system wisdom from <u>/etc/fftw/wisdoml</u> (which is normally read by default).

       <b>-w</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--wisdom-file</b>=<u>file</u>
              Import wisdom from <u>file</u> (in addition to the system wisdom,  unless  <b>-n</b>  is  specified).   Multiple
              wisdom  files can be read via multiple <b>-w</b> options.  If <u>file</u> is "-", then read wisdom from standard
              input.

       <b>-T</b> <u>N</u>, <b>--threads</b>=<u>N</u>
              Plan with <u>N</u> threads.  This option is only present if FFTW was configured with thread support.
