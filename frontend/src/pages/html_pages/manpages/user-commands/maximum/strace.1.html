       <b>strace</b> <b>--tips</b>[=<u>format</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  simplest  case  <b>strace</b> runs the specified <u>command</u> until it exits.  It intercepts and records the
       system calls which are called by a process and the signals which are received by a process.  The name  of
       each  system  call,  its  arguments  and  its  return  value are printed on standard error or to the file
       specified with the <b>-o</b> option.

       <b>strace</b> is a useful diagnostic, instructional, and debugging tool.  System administrators,  diagnosticians
       and  trouble-shooters  will find it invaluable for solving problems with programs for which the source is
       not readily available since they do not need to be recompiled in order to trace them.  Students,  hackers
       and  the overly-curious will find that a great deal can be learned about a system and its system calls by
       tracing even ordinary programs.  And programmers will find that since system calls and signals are events
       that happen at the user/kernel interface, a close examination of this boundary is  very  useful  for  bug
       isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

       Each  line  in  the trace contains the system call name, followed by its arguments in parentheses and its
       return value.  An example from stracing the command "cat /dev/null" is:

           open("/dev/null", O_RDONLY) = 3

       Errors (typically a return value of -1) have the errno symbol and error string appended.

           open("/foo/bar", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

       Signals are printed as signal symbol and  decoded  siginfo  structure.   An  excerpt  from  stracing  and
       interrupting the command "sleep 666" is:

           sigsuspend([] &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
           --- SIGINT {si_signo=SIGINT, si_code=SI_USER, si_pid=...} ---
           +++ killed by SIGINT +++

       If  a  system  call  is  being  executed  and  meanwhile  another  one  is  being called from a different
       thread/process then <b>strace</b> will try to preserve the order of those events and mark the  ongoing  call  as
       being <u>unfinished</u>.  When the call returns it will be marked as <u>resumed</u>.

           [pid 28772] select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
           [pid 28779] clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, {tv_sec=1130322148, tv_nsec=3977000}) = 0
           [pid 28772] &lt;... select resumed&gt; )      = 1 (in [3])

       Interruption  of  a  (restartable)  system  call  by a signal delivery is processed differently as kernel
       terminates the system call  and  also  arranges  its  immediate  reexecution  after  the  signal  handler
       completes.

           read(0, 0x7ffff72cf5cf, 1)              = ? ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted)
           --- SIGALRM {si_signo=SIGALRM, si_code=SI_KERNEL} ---
           rt_sigreturn({mask=[]})                 = 0
           read(0, "", 1)                          = 0

       Arguments  are  printed in symbolic form with passion.  This example shows the shell performing "&gt;&gt;xyzzy"
       output redirection:

           open("xyzzy", O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0666) = 3

       Here, the second and the third argument of <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2) are decoded by breaking down the  flag  argument  into
       its  three  bitwise-OR  constituents  and  printing  the  mode  value  in  octal by tradition.  Where the
       traditional or native usage differs from ANSI or POSIX, the latter forms are preferred.  In  some  cases,
       <b>strace</b> output is proven to be more readable than the source.

       Structure  pointers  are  dereferenced  and  the  members  are  displayed as appropriate.  In most cases,
       arguments are formatted in the most C-like fashion possible.  For example, the essence of the command "ls
       -l /dev/null" is captured as:

           lstat("/dev/null", {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0666, st_rdev=makedev(0x1, 0x3), ...}) = 0

       Notice how the 'struct stat' argument is dereferenced and how each member is displayed symbolically.   In
       particular, observe how the <b>st_mode</b> member is carefully decoded into a bitwise-OR of symbolic and numeric
       values.   Also  notice in this example that the first argument to <b><a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a></b>(2) is an input to the system call
       and the second argument is an output.  Since output arguments are not modified if the system call  fails,
       arguments  may not always be dereferenced.  For example, retrying the "ls -l" example with a non-existent
       file produces the following line:

           lstat("/foo/bar", 0xb004) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

       In this case the porch light is on but nobody is home.

       Syscalls unknown to <b>strace</b> are printed raw, with the unknown system call number  printed  in  hexadecimal
       form and prefixed with "syscall_":

           syscall_0xbad(0x1, 0x2, 0x3, 0x4, 0x5, 0x6) = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)

       Character  pointers  are  dereferenced  and printed as C strings.  Non-printing characters in strings are
       normally represented by ordinary C escape codes.  Only the first <u>strsize</u> (32 by default) bytes of strings
       are printed; longer strings have an ellipsis appended following the closing quote.  Here is a  line  from
       "ls -l" where the <b><a href="../man3/getpwuid.3.html">getpwuid</a></b>(3) library routine is reading the password file:

           read(3, "root::0:0:System Administrator:/"..., 1024) = 422

       While  structures  are annotated using curly braces, pointers to basic types and arrays are printed using
       square brackets with commas separating the elements.  Here is an example from  the  command  <b><a href="../man1/id.1.html">id</a></b>(1)  on  a
       system with supplementary group ids:

           getgroups(32, [100, 0]) = 2

       On  the other hand, bit-sets are also shown using square brackets, but set elements are separated only by
       a space.  Here is the shell, preparing to execute an external command:

           sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD TTOU], []) = 0

       Here, the second argument is a bit-set of two signals, <b>SIGCHLD</b> and <b>SIGTTOU</b>.  In some cases,  the  bit-set
       is  so full that printing out the unset elements is more valuable.  In that case, the bit-set is prefixed
       by a tilde like this:

           sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, ~[], NULL) = 0

       Here, the second argument represents the full set of all signals.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>General</b>
       <b>-e</b> <u>expr</u>     A qualifying expression which modifies which events to trace  or  how  to  trace  them.   The
                   format of the expression is:

                             [<u>qualifier</u><b>=</b>][<b>!</b>]<u>value</u>[<b>,</b><u>value</u>]...

                   where  <u>qualifier</u> is one of <b>trace</b> (or <b>t</b>), <b>trace-fds</b> (or <b>trace-fd</b> or <b>fd</b> or <b>fds</b>), <b>abbrev</b> (or <b>a</b>),
                   <b>verbose</b> (or <b>v</b>), <b>raw</b> (or <b>x</b>), <b>signal</b> (or <b>signals</b> or <b>s</b>), <b>read</b> (or <b>reads</b> or <b>r</b>), <b>write</b> (or  <b>writes</b>
                   or  <b>w</b>),  <b>fault</b>, <b>inject</b>, <b>status</b>, <b>quiet</b> (or <b>silent</b> or <b>silence</b> or <b>q</b>), <b>decode-fds</b> (or <b>decode-fd</b>),
                   <b>decode-pids</b> (or <b>decode-pid</b>), or <b>kvm</b>, and <u>value</u> is a  qualifier-dependent  symbol  or  number.
                   The  default  qualifier  is <b>trace</b>.  Using an exclamation mark negates the set of values.  For
                   example, <b>-e</b> <b>open</b> means literally <b>-e</b> <b>trace</b>=<b>open</b> which in turn means trace only the <b>open</b> system
                   call.  By contrast, <b>-e</b> <b>trace</b>=!<b>open</b>  means  to  trace  every  system  call  except  <b>open</b>.   In
                   addition, the special values <b>all</b> and <b>none</b> have the obvious meanings.

                   Note  that  some  shells  use  the exclamation point for history expansion even inside quoted
                   arguments.  If so, you must escape the exclamation point with a backslash.

   <b>Startup</b>
       <b>-E</b> <u>var</u>=<u>val</u>
       <b>--env</b>=<u>var</u>=<u>val</u>
                   Run command with <u>var</u>=<u>val</u> in its list of environment variables.

       <b>-E</b> <u>var</u>
       <b>--env</b>=<u>var</u>   Remove <u>var</u> from the inherited list of environment variables  before  passing  it  on  to  the
                   command.

       <b>-p</b> <u>pid</u>
       <b>--attach</b>=<u>pid</u>
                   Attach to the process with the process ID <u>pid</u> and begin tracing.  The trace may be terminated
                   at any time by a keyboard interrupt signal (<b>CTRL-C</b>).  <b>strace</b> will respond by detaching itself
                   from  the  traced process(es) leaving it (them) to continue running.  Multiple <b>-p</b> options can
                   be used to attach to many processes in addition to <u>command</u> (which is optional if at least one
                   <b>-p</b> option is given).  Multiple process IDs, separated by either comma  (“,”),  space  (“  ”),
                   tab,  or  newline  character,  can  be provided as an argument to a single <b>-p</b> option, so, for
                   example, <b>-p</b> "$(pidof PROG)" and <b>-p</b> "$(pgrep PROG)" syntaxes are supported.

       <b>-u</b> <u>username</u>
       <b>--user</b>=<u>username</u>
                   Run command with the user ID, group ID, and supplementary groups of <u>username</u>.  This option is
                   only useful when running as root and enables the correct execution of  setuid  and/or  setgid
                   binaries.   Unless  this  option  is  used  setuid  and  setgid programs are executed without
                   effective privileges.
       <b>-u</b> <u>UID:GID</u>
       <b>--user</b>=<u>UID:GID</u>
                   Alternative syntax where the program is started with exactly the given user  and  group  IDs,
                   and an empty list of supplementary groups.  In this case, user and group name lookups are not
                   performed.

       <b>--argv0</b>=<u>name</u>
                   Set argv[0] of the command being executed to <u>name</u>.  Useful for tracing multi-call executables
                   which interpret argv[0], such as busybox or kmod.

   <b>Tracing</b>
       <b>-b</b> <u>syscall</u>
       <b>--detach-on</b>=<u>syscall</u>
                   If  specified syscall is reached, detach from traced process.  Currently, only <b>execve</b> keyword
                   is supported, which includes <b><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></b>(2) and <b><a href="../man2/execveat.2.html">execveat</a></b>(2) syscalls.  This option  is  useful  if
                   you  want  to  trace multi-threaded process and therefore require <b>-f</b>, but don't want to trace
                   its (potentially very complex) children.

       <b>-D</b>
       <b>--daemonize</b>
       <b>--daemonize</b>=<b>grandchild</b>
                   Run tracer process as a grandchild, not as the  parent  of  the  tracee.   This  reduces  the
                   visible effect of <b>strace</b> by keeping the tracee a direct child of the calling process.

       <b>-DD</b>
       <b>--daemonize</b>=<b>pgroup</b>
       <b>--daemonize</b>=<b>pgrp</b>
                   Run  tracer  process  as  tracee's  grandchild  in  a separate process group.  In addition to
                   reduction of the visible effect of <b>strace</b>, it also avoids  killing  of  <b>strace</b>  with  <b><a href="../man2/kill.2.html">kill</a></b>(2)
                   issued to the whole process group.

       <b>-DDD</b>
       <b>--daemonize</b>=<b>session</b>
                   Run  tracer  process as tracee's grandchild in a separate session ("true daemonisation").  In
                   addition to reduction of the visible effect of <b>strace</b>, it also avoids killing of <b>strace</b>  upon
                   session termination.

       <b>-f</b>
       <b>--follow-forks</b>
                   Trace  child  processes  as they are created by currently traced processes as a result of the
                   <b><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/vfork.2.html">vfork</a></b>(2) and <b><a href="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</a></b>(2) system calls.  Note that <b>-p</b> <u>PID</u> <b>-f</b> will attach all threads  of
                   process <u>PID</u> if it is multi-threaded, not only thread with <u>thread_id</u> = <u>PID</u>.

       <b>--output-separately</b>
                   If the <b>--output</b>=<u>filename</u> option is in effect, each processes trace is written to <u>filename</u>.<u>pid</u>
                   where <u>pid</u> is the numeric process id of each process.

       <b>-ff</b>
       <b>--follow-forks</b> <b>--output-separately</b>
                   Combine  the effects of <b>--follow-forks</b> and <b>--output-separately</b> options.  This is incompatible
                   with <b>-c</b>, since no per-process counts are kept.

                   One might want to consider using <b><a href="../man1/strace-log-merge.1.html">strace-log-merge</a></b>(1) to obtain a combined strace log view.

       <b>-I</b> <u>interruptible</u>
       <b>--interruptible</b>=<u>interruptible</u>
                   When <b>strace</b> can be interrupted by signals (such as pressing <b>CTRL-C</b>).

                   <b>1</b>, <b>anywhere</b>    no signals are blocked;
                   <b>2</b>, <b>waiting</b>     fatal signals are blocked while decoding syscall (default);
                   <b>3</b>, <b>never</b>       fatal signals are always blocked (default if <b>-o</b> <u>FILE</u> <u>PROG</u>);
                   <b>4</b>, <b>never_tstp</b>  fatal signals and <b>SIGTSTP</b> (<b>CTRL-Z</b>) are always blocked (useful to  make  <b>strace</b>
                                  <b>-o</b> <u>FILE</u> <u>PROG</u> not stop on <b>CTRL-Z</b>, default if <b>-D</b>).

       <b>--syscall-limit</b>=<u>limit</u>
                   Detach  all  tracees  when <u>limit</u> number of syscalls have been captured. Syscalls filtered out
                   via <b>--trace</b>, <b>--trace-path</b> or <b>--status</b> options are not considered when keeping  track  of  the
                   number of syscalls that are captured.

       <b>--kill-on-exit</b>
                   Apply  <b>PTRACE_O_EXITKILL</b>  ptrace option to all tracee processes (which sends a SIGKILL signal
                   to the tracee if the tracer exits) and do not detach them on cleanup so they will not be left
                   running after the tracer exit.  <b>--kill-on-exit</b> is not compatible with <b>-p</b>/<b>--attach</b> options.

   <b>Filtering</b>
       <b>-e</b> <b>trace</b>=<u>syscall_set</u>
       <b>-e</b> <b>t</b>=<u>syscall_set</u>
       <b>--trace</b>=<u>syscall_set</u>
                   Trace only the specified set of system calls.  <u>syscall_set</u> is  defined  as  [<b>!</b>]<u>value</u>[<b>,</b><u>value</u>],
                   and <u>value</u> can be one of the following:

                   <u>syscall</u>      Trace  specific syscall, specified by its name (see <b><a href="../man2/syscalls.2.html">syscalls</a></b>(2) for a reference,
                                but also see <b>NOTES</b>).

                   <b>?</b><u>value</u>       Question mark before the syscall qualification allows suppression  of  error  in
                                case no syscalls matched the qualification provided.

                   <u>value</u><b>@64</b>     Limit the syscall specification described by <u>value</u> to 64-bit personality.

                   <u>value</u><b>@32</b>     Limit the syscall specification described by <u>value</u> to 32-bit personality.

                   <u>value</u><b>@x32</b>    Limit the syscall specification described by <u>value</u> to x32 personality.

                   <b>all</b>          Trace all system calls.

                   <b>/</b><u>regex</u>       Trace  only those system calls that match the <u>regex</u>.  You can use <b>POSIX</b> Extended
                                Regular Expression syntax (see <b><a href="../man7/regex.7.html">regex</a></b>(7)).

                   <b>%file</b>
                   <b>file</b>         Trace all system calls which take a file name as an argument.  You can think  of
                                this as an abbreviation for <b>-e</b> <b>trace</b>=<b>open</b>,<b>stat</b>,<b>chmod</b>,<b>unlink</b>,...  which is useful
                                to  seeing  what  files  the  process  is  referencing.   Furthermore, using the
                                abbreviation will ensure that you don't accidentally forget to  include  a  call
                                like  <b><a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a></b>(2) in the list.  Betchya woulda forgot that one.  The syntax without
                                a preceding percent sign ("<b>-e</b> <b>trace</b>=<b>file</b>") is deprecated.

                   <b>%process</b>
                   <b>process</b>      Trace  system  calls  associated  with  process   lifecycle   (creation,   exec,
                                termination).   The syntax without a preceding percent sign ("<b>-e</b> <b>trace</b>=<b>process</b>")
                                is deprecated.

                   The <b>-c</b> option is useful for determining which system calls might be  useful  to  trace.   For
                   example, <b>trace</b>=<b>open,close,read,write</b> means to only trace those four system calls.  Be careful
                   when  making  inferences  about the user/kernel boundary if only a subset of system calls are
                   being monitored.  The default is <b>trace</b>=<b>all</b>.

       <b>-e</b> <b>trace-fd</b>=<u>set</u>
       <b>-e</b> <b>trace-fds</b>=<u>set</u>
       <b>-e</b> <b>fd</b>=<u>set</u>
       <b>-e</b> <b>fds</b>=<u>set</u>
       <b>--trace-fds</b>=<u>set</u>
                   Trace only the  syscalls  that  operate  on  the  specified  subset  of  (non-negative)  file
                   descriptors.   Note  that  usage of this option also filters out all the syscalls that do not
                   operate on file descriptors at all.  Applies in (inclusive) disjunction with the <b>--trace-path</b>
                   option.

       <b>-e</b> <b>signal</b>=<u>set</u>
       <b>-e</b> <b>signals</b>=<u>set</u>
       <b>-e</b> <b>s</b>=<u>set</u>
       <b>--signal</b>=<u>set</u>
                   Trace only the specified subset  of  signals.   The  default  is  <b>signal</b>=<b>all</b>.   For  example,
                   <b>signal</b>=!<b>SIGIO</b> (or <b>signal</b>=!<b>io</b>) causes <b>SIGIO</b> signals not to be traced.

       <b>-e</b> <b>status</b>=<u>set</u>
       <b>--status</b>=<u>set</u>
                   Print  only  system calls with the specified return status.  The default is <b>status</b>=<b>all</b>.  When
                   using the <b>status</b> qualifier, because <b>strace</b> waits for system calls to return  before  deciding
                   whether  they  should be printed or not, the traditional order of events may not be preserved
                   anymore.  If two system calls are executed by concurrent threads,  <b>strace</b>  will  first  print
                   both  the  entry  and  exit  of the first system call to exit, regardless of their respective
                   entry time.  The entry and exit of the second system call to exit will be printed afterwards.
                   Here is an example when <b><a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a></b>(2) is called, but a different  thread  calls  <b><a href="../man2/clock_gettime.2.html">clock_gettime</a></b>(2)
                   before <b><a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a></b>(2) finishes:

                       [pid 28779] 1130322148.939977 clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, {1130322148, 939977000}) = 0
                       [pid 28772] 1130322148.438139 select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL) = 1 (in [3])

                   <u>set</u> can include the following elements:

                   <b>successful</b>   Trace  system  calls that returned without an error code.  The <b>-z</b> option has the
                                effect of <b>status</b>=<b>successful</b>.
                   <b>failed</b>       Trace system calls that returned with an error code.   The  <b>-Z</b>  option  has  the
                                effect of <b>status</b>=<b>failed</b>.
                   <b>unfinished</b>   Trace  system calls that did not return.  This might happen, for example, due to
                                an execve call in a neighbour thread.
                   <b>unavailable</b>  Trace system calls that returned but strace failed to fetch the error status.
                   <b>detached</b>     Trace system calls for which strace detached before the return.

       <b>-P</b> <u>path</u>
       <b>--trace-path</b>=<u>path</u>
                   Trace only system calls accessing <u>path</u>.  Multiple <b>-P</b> options can be used to  specify  several
                   paths.  Applies in (inclusive) disjunction with the <b>--trace-fds</b> option.

       <b>-z</b>
       <b>--successful-only</b>
                   Print only syscalls that returned without an error code.

       <b>-Z</b>
       <b>--failed-only</b>
                   Print only syscalls that returned with an error code.

   <b>Output</b> <b>format</b>
       <b>-a</b> <u>column</u>
       <b>--columns</b>=<u>column</u>
                   Align return values in a specific column (default column 40).

       <b>-e</b> <b>abbrev</b>=<u>syscall_set</u>
       <b>-e</b> <b>a</b>=<u>syscall_set</u>
       <b>--abbrev</b>=<u>syscall_set</u>
                   Abbreviate  the  output  from  printing  each  member of large structures.  The syntax of the
                   <u>syscall_set</u> specification is the same as in the <b>-e</b> <b>trace</b> option.  The default is  <b>abbrev</b>=<b>all</b>.
                   The <b>-v</b> option has the effect of <b>abbrev</b>=<b>none</b>.

       <b>-e</b> <b>verbose</b>=<u>syscall_set</u>
       <b>-e</b> <b>v</b>=<u>syscall_set</u>
       <b>--verbose</b>=<u>syscall_set</u>
                   Dereference  structures for the specified set of system calls.  The syntax of the <u>syscall_set</u>
                   specification is the same as in the <b>-e</b> <b>trace</b> option.  The default is <b>verbose</b>=<b>all</b>.

       <b>-e</b> <b>raw</b>=<u>syscall_set</u>
       <b>-e</b> <b>x</b>=<u>syscall_set</u>
       <b>--raw</b>=<u>syscall_set</u>
                   Print raw, undecoded arguments for the specified set of system  calls.   The  syntax  of  the
                   <u>syscall_set</u>  specification is the same as in the <b>-e</b> <b>trace</b> option.  This option has the effect
                   of causing all arguments to be printed in hexadecimal.  This is mostly useful  if  you  don't
                   trust  the decoding or you need to know the actual numeric value of an argument.  See also <b>-X</b>
                   <b>raw</b> option.

       <b>-e</b> <b>read</b>=<u>set</u>
       <b>-e</b> <b>reads</b>=<u>set</u>
       <b>-e</b> <b>r</b>=<u>set</u>
       <b>--read</b>=<u>set</u>  Perform a full hexadecimal and ASCII dump of all the data read from file  descriptors  listed
                   in the specified set.  For example, to see all input activity on file descriptors <u>3</u> and <u>5</u> use
                   <b>-e</b> <b>read</b>=<u>3</u>,<u>5</u>.   Note  that  this  is independent from the normal tracing of the <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2) system
                   call which is controlled by the option <b>-e</b> <b>trace</b>=<b>read</b>.

       <b>-e</b> <b>writes</b>=<u>set</u>
       <b>-e</b> <b>w</b>=<u>set</u>
       <b>--write</b>=<u>set</u> Perform a full hexadecimal and ASCII dump of all the data written to file descriptors  listed
                   in  the  specified  set.  For example, to see all output activity on file descriptors <u>3</u> and <u>5</u>
                   use <b>-e</b> <b>write</b>=<u>3</u>,<u>5</u>.  Note that this is independent from the  normal  tracing  of  the  <b><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a></b>(2)
                   system call which is controlled by the option <b>-e</b> <b>trace</b>=<b>write</b>.

                   Decode  various  information  associated with process IDs (and also thread IDs, process group
                   IDs, and session IDs).  The default is  <b>decode-pids</b>=<b>none</b>.   <u>set</u>  can  include  the  following
                   elements:

                   <b>comm</b>    Print command names associated with thread or process IDs.
                   <b>pidns</b>   Print  thread,  process,  process group, and session IDs in strace's PID namespace if

       <b>-e</b> <b>kvm</b>=<b>vcpu</b>
       <b>--kvm</b>=<b>vcpu</b>  Print the exit reason of kvm vcpu.  Requires Linux kernel version 4.16.0 or higher.

       <b>-e</b> <b>namespace</b>=<b>new</b>
       <b>--namespace</b>=<b>new</b>
                   Print the new namespaces entered by the tracee.  The following system  calls  are  supported:

       <b>-i</b>
       <b>--instruction-pointer</b>
                   Print the instruction pointer at the time of the system call.

       <b>-n</b>
       <b>--syscall-number</b>
                   Print the syscall number.

       <b>-k</b>
       <b>--stack-trace</b>[=<b>symbol</b>]
                   Print the execution stack trace of the traced processes after each system call.

       <b>--stack-trace-frame-limit</b>=<u>limit</u>
                   Print  no  more  than  this  amount of stack trace frames when backtracing a system call (the
                   default is 256).  Use this option with the <b>--stack-trace</b> (or <b>-k</b>) option.

       <b>-o</b> <u>filename</u>
       <b>--output</b>=<u>filename</u>
                   Write the trace output to the file <u>filename</u> rather than to stderr.  <u>filename</u>.<u>pid</u> form is used
                   if <b>-ff</b> option is supplied.  If the argument begins with '|' or '!', the rest of the  argument
                   is  treated  as  a  command and all output is piped to it.  This is convenient for piping the
                   debugging output to a program without affecting the redirections of executed  programs.   The
                   latter is not compatible with <b>-ff</b> option currently.

       <b>-A</b>
       <b>--output-append-mode</b>

       <b>--quiet</b>
       <b>--quiet</b>=<b>attach</b>,<b>personality</b>
                   Suppress  messages  about  attaching,  detaching,  and  personality  changes.   This  happens
                   automatically when output is redirected to a file and the command is run directly instead  of
                   attaching.

       <b>-qq</b>
       <b>--quiet</b>=<b>attach</b>,<b>personality</b>,<b>exit</b>
                   Suppress messages attaching, detaching, personality changes, and about process exit status.

       <b>-qqq</b>
       <b>--quiet</b>=<b>all</b> Suppress  all  suppressible messages (please refer to the <b>-e</b> <b>quiet</b> option description for the
                   full list of suppressible messages).

       <b>-r</b>
       <b>--relative-timestamps</b>[=<u>precision</u>]
                   Print a relative timestamp upon entry to each system call.  This records the time  difference
                   between  the  beginning of successive system calls.  <u>precision</u> can be one of <b>s</b> (for seconds),
                   <b>ms</b> (milliseconds), <b>us</b> (microseconds), or <b>ns</b> (nanoseconds), and allows setting  the  precision
                   of  time  value being printed.  Default is <b>us</b> (microseconds).  Note that since <b>-r</b> option uses
                   the monotonic clock time for measuring time difference and  not  the  wall  clock  time,  its
                   measurements can differ from the difference in time reported by the <b>-t</b> option.

       <b>-s</b> <u>strsize</u>
       <b>--string-limit</b>=<u>strsize</u>
                   Specify  the  maximum  string size to print (the default is 32).  Note that filenames are not
                   considered strings and are always printed in full.

       <b>--absolute-timestamps</b>[=[[<b>format:</b>]<u>format</u>],[[<b>precision:</b>]<u>precision</u>]]
       <b>--timestamps</b>[=[[<b>format:</b>]<u>format</u>],[[<b>precision:</b>]<u>precision</u>]]
                   Prefix each line of the trace with the wall clock time  in  the  specified  <u>format</u>  with  the
                   specified <u>precision</u>.  <u>format</u> can be one of the following:

                   <b>none</b>          No time stamp is printed.  Can be used to override the previous setting.
                   <b>time</b>          Wall clock time (<b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3) format string is <b>%T</b>).
                   <b>unix</b>          Number of seconds since the epoch (<b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3) format string is <b>%s</b>).

                   <u>precision</u>  can  be  one  of  <b>s</b>  (for  seconds),  <b>ms</b>  (milliseconds), <b>us</b> (microseconds), or <b>ns</b>
                   (nanoseconds).  Default arguments for the option are <b>format:time</b>,<b>precision:s</b>.

       <b>-t</b>
       <b>--absolute-timestamps</b>
                   Prefix each line of the trace with the wall clock time.

       <b>-tt</b>
       <b>--absolute-timestamps</b>=<b>precision:us</b>
                   If given twice, the time printed will include the microseconds.

       <b>-ttt</b>
       <b>--absolute-timestamps</b>=<b>format:unix</b>,<b>precision:us</b>
                   If given thrice, the time printed will include the microseconds and the leading portion  will
                   be printed as the number of seconds since the epoch.

       <b>-T</b>
       <b>--syscall-times</b>[=<u>precision</u>]
                   Show  the time spent in system calls.  This records the time difference between the beginning
                   and the end of each system call.  <u>precision</u> can be one of <b>s</b> (for seconds), <b>ms</b> (milliseconds),
                   <b>us</b> (microseconds), or <b>ns</b> (nanoseconds), and allows setting the precision of time value  being
                   printed.  Default is <b>us</b> (microseconds).

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--no-abbrev</b> Print  unabbreviated  versions  of environment, stat, termios, etc.  calls.  These structures
                   are very common in calls and  so  the  default  behavior  displays  a  reasonable  subset  of
                   structure members.  Use this option to get all of the gory details.

       <b>--strings-in-hex</b>[=<u>option</u>]
                   Control  usage of escape sequences with hexadecimal numbers in the printed strings.  Normally
                   (when no <b>--strings-in-hex</b> or <b>-x</b> option is supplied), escape sequences are used to print  non-
                   printable and non-ASCII characters (that is, characters with a character code less than 32 or
                   greater  than  127),  or to disambiguate the output (so, for quotes and other characters that
                   encase the printed string, for example, angle brackets,  in  case  of  file  descriptor  path
                   output);  for  the  former use case, unless it is a white space character that has a symbolic
                   escape sequence defined in the C standard (that is, “<b>\t</b>” for a horizontal  tab,  “<b>\n</b>”  for  a
                   newline,  “<b>\v</b>”  for  a vertical tab, “<b>\f</b>” for a form feed page break, and “<b>\r</b>” for a carriage
                   return) are printed using escape sequences with numbers that correspond to their byte values,
                   with octal number format being the default.  <u>option</u> can be one of the following:

                   <b>none</b>             Hexadecimal numbers are not used in the output at all.  When there is a need
                                    to emit an escape sequence, octal numbers are used.
                   <b>non-ascii-chars</b>  Hexadecimal numbers are used instead of octal in the escape sequences.
                   <b>non-ascii</b>        Strings that contain non-ASCII characters are printed using escape sequences
                                    with hexadecimal numbers.
                   <b>all</b>              All strings are printed using escape sequences with hexadecimal numbers.

                   When the option is supplied without an argument, <b>all</b> is assumed.

       <b>-x</b>
       <b>--strings-in-hex</b>=<b>non-ascii</b>
                   Print all non-ASCII strings in hexadecimal string format.

       <b>-xx</b>
       <b>--strings-in-hex</b>[=<b>all</b>]
                   Print all strings in hexadecimal string format.

       <b>-X</b> <u>format</u>
       <b>--const-print-style</b>=<u>format</u>
                   Set the format for printing of named constants and flags.  Supported <u>format</u> values are:

                   <b>raw</b>       Raw number output, without decoding.
                   <b>abbrev</b>    Output a named constant or a set of flags instead of the raw  number  if  they  are
                             found.  This is the default <b>strace</b> behaviour.
                   <b>verbose</b>   Output both the raw value and the decoded string (as a comment).

       <b>-y</b>
       <b>--decode-fds</b>
       <b>--decode-fds</b>=<b>path</b>
                   Print paths associated with file descriptor arguments and with the <b>AT_FDCWD</b> constant.

       <b>-yy</b>
       <b>--decode-fds</b>=<b>all</b>
                   Print   all   available  information  associated  with  file  descriptors:  protocol-specific
                   information associated with socket file descriptors, block/character device number associated
                   with device file descriptors, and PIDs associated with pidfd file descriptors.

       <b>--pidns-translation</b>
       <b>--decode-pids</b>=<b>pidns</b>
                   If strace and tracee are in different PID namespaces, print PIDs in strace's namespace, too.

       <b>-Y</b>
       <b>--decode-pids</b>=<b>comm</b>
                   Print command names for PIDs.

       <b>--always-show-pid</b>
                   Show PID prefix also for the process started by strace.  Implied when  -f  and  -o  are  both
                   specified.

   <b>Statistics</b>
       <b>-c</b>
       <b>--summary-only</b>
                   Count  time,  calls,  and  errors  for each system call and report a summary on program exit,
                   suppressing the regular output.  This attempts to show system time (CPU time spent running in
                   the kernel) independent of wall clock time.  If <b>-c</b> is used with <b>-f</b>, only aggregate totals for
                   all traced processes are kept.

       <b>-C</b>
       <b>--summary</b>   Like <b>-c</b> but also print regular output while processes are running.

       <b>-O</b> <u>overhead</u>
       <b>--summary-syscall-overhead</b>=<u>overhead</u>
                   Set the overhead for tracing system calls to <u>overhead</u>.  This is  useful  for  overriding  the
                   default  heuristic  for  guessing how much time is spent in mere measuring when timing system
                   calls using the <b>-c</b> option.  The accuracy of the heuristic can be gauged  by  timing  a  given
                   program run without tracing (using <b><a href="../man1/time.1.html">time</a></b>(1)) and comparing the accumulated system call time to
                   the total produced using <b>-c</b>.

                   The  format  of  <u>overhead</u>  specification  is  described  in section <u>Time</u> <u>specification</u> <u>format</u>
                   <u>description</u>.

       <b>-S</b> <u>sortby</u>
       <b>--summary-sort-by</b>=<u>sortby</u>
                   Sort the output of the histogram printed by the <b>-c</b> option by the specified criterion.   Legal
                   values  are  <b>time</b>  (or  <b>time-percent</b>  or  <b>time-total</b> or <b>total-time</b>), <b>min-time</b> (or <b>shortest</b> or
                   <b>time-min</b>), <b>max-time</b> (or <b>longest</b> or <b>time-max</b>),  <b>avg-time</b>  (or  <b>time-avg</b>),  <b>calls</b>  (or  <b>count</b>),
                   <b>errors</b> (or <b>error</b>), <b>name</b> (or <b>syscall</b> or <b>syscall-name</b>), and <b>nothing</b> (or <b>none</b>); default is <b>time</b>.

       <b>-U</b> <u>columns</u>
       <b>--summary-columns</b>=<u>columns</u>
                   Configure a set (and order) of columns being shown in the call summary.  The <u>columns</u> argument
                   is a comma-separated list with items being one of the following:

                   <b>time-percent</b> (or <b>time</b>)              Percentage  of  cumulative  time  consumed  by a specific
                                                       system call.
                   <b>total-time</b> (or <b>time-total</b>)          Total system (or wall clock, if <b>-w</b>  option  is  provided)
                                                       time consumed by a specific system call.
                   <b>min-time</b> (or <b>shortest</b> or <b>time-min</b>)  Minimum observed call duration.
                   <b>max-time</b> (or <b>longest</b> or <b>time-max</b>)   Maximum observed call duration.
                   <b>avg-time</b> (or <b>time-avg</b>)              Average call duration.
                   <b>calls</b> (or <b>count</b>)                    Call count.
                   <b>errors</b> (or <b>error</b>)                   Error count.
                   <b>name</b> (or <b>syscall</b> or <b>syscall-name</b>)   Syscall name.

                   The  default  value is <b>time-percent</b>,<b>total-time</b>,<b>avg-time</b>,<b>calls</b>,<b>errors</b>,<b>name</b>.  If the <b>name</b> field
                   is not supplied explicitly, it is added as the last column.

       <b>-w</b>
       <b>--summary-wall-clock</b>
                   Summarise the time difference between the beginning and end of each system call.  The default
                   is to summarise the system time.

   <b>Tampering</b>
       <b>-e</b> <b>inject</b>=<u>syscall_set</u>[:<b>error</b>=<u>errno</u>|:<b>retval</b>=<u>value</u>][:<b>signal</b>=<u>sig</u>][:<b>syscall</b>=<u>syscall</u>][:<b>delay_enter</b>=<u>delay</u>]
       [:<b>delay_exit</b>=<u>delay</u>][:<b>poke_enter</b>=<u>@argN=DATAN,@argM=DATAM...</u>][:<b>poke_exit</b>=<u>@argN=DATAN,@argM=DATAM...</u>]
       [:<b>when</b>=<u>expr</u>]
       <b>--inject</b>=<u>syscall_set</u>[:<b>error</b>=<u>errno</u>|:<b>retval</b>=<u>value</u>][:<b>signal</b>=<u>sig</u>][:<b>syscall</b>=<u>syscall</u>][:<b>delay_enter</b>=<u>delay</u>]
       [:<b>delay_exit</b>=<u>delay</u>][:<b>poke_enter</b>=<u>@argN=DATAN,@argM=DATAM...</u>][:<b>poke_exit</b>=<u>@argN=DATAN,@argM=DATAM...</u>]
       [:<b>when</b>=<u>expr</u>]
                   Perform syscall tampering for the specified set of syscalls.  The syntax of  the  <u>syscall_set</u>
                   specification is the same as in the <b>-e</b> <b>trace</b> option.

                   At  least  one  of  <b>error</b>,  <b>retval</b>, <b>signal</b>, <b>delay_enter</b>, <b>delay_exit</b>, <b>poke_enter</b>, or <b>poke_exit</b>
                   options has to be specified.  <b>error</b> and <b>retval</b> are mutually exclusive.

                   If :<b>error</b>=<u>errno</u> option is specified, a fault is  injected  into  a  syscall  invocation:  the
                   syscall number is replaced by -1 which corresponds to an invalid syscall (unless a syscall is
                   specified  with  :<b>syscall=</b>  option),  and  the error code is specified using a symbolic <u>errno</u>
                   value like <b>ENOSYS</b> or a numeric value within 1..4095 range.

                   If :<b>retval</b>=<u>value</u> option is specified, success injection is performed: the syscall  number  is
                   replaced by -1, but a bogus success value is returned to the callee.

                   If  :<b>signal</b>=<u>sig</u>  option  is  specified with either a symbolic value like <b>SIGSEGV</b> or a numeric
                   value within 1..<b>SIGRTMAX</b> range, that signal is delivered on entering every syscall  specified
                   by the <u>set</u>.

                   If  :<b>delay_enter</b>=<u>delay</u>  or  :<b>delay_exit</b>=<u>delay</u>  options  are  specified,  delay  injection  is
                   performed: the tracee is delayed by time period specified by <u>delay</u> on entering or exiting the
                   syscall, respectively.  The format of  <u>delay</u>  specification  is  described  in  section  <u>Time</u>
                   <u>specification</u> <u>format</u> <u>description</u>.

                   If  :<b>poke_enter</b>=<u>@argN=DATAN,@argM=DATAM...</u>   or :<b>poke_exit</b>=<u>@argN=DATAN,@argM=DATAM...</u> options
                   are specified, tracee's memory at locations, pointed to by system  call  arguments  <u>argN</u>  and
                   <u>argM</u>  (going  from  <u>arg1</u>  to  <u>arg7</u>)  is  overwritten  by  data  <u>DATAN</u> and <u>DATAM</u> (specified in
                   hexadecimal format; for example  :<b>poke_enter</b>=<u>@arg1=0000DEAD0000BEEF</u>).   :<b>poke_enter</b>  modifies
                   memory on syscall enter, and :<b>poke_exit</b> - on exit.

                   If    :<b>signal</b>=<u>sig</u>    option    is    specified   without   :<b>error</b>=<u>errno</u>,   :<b>retval</b>=<u>value</u>   or
                   :<b>delay_{enter,exit}</b>=<u>usecs</u> options, then only a signal <u>sig</u>  is  delivered  without  a  syscall
                   fault   or  delay  injection.   Conversely,  :<b>error</b>=<u>errno</u>  or  :<b>retval</b>=<u>value</u>  option  without
                   :<b>delay_enter</b>=<u>delay</u>,  :<b>delay_exit</b>=<u>delay</u>  or  :<b>signal</b>=<u>sig</u>  options  injects  a  fault   without
                   delivering a signal or injecting a delay, etc.

                   If  :<b>signal</b>=<u>sig</u>  option  is  specified together with :<b>error</b>=<u>errno</u> or :<b>retval</b>=<u>value</u>, then both
                   injection of a fault or success and signal delivery are performed.

                   if :<b>syscall</b>=<u>syscall</u> option is specified, the corresponding syscall with no  side  effects  is
                   injected instead of -1.  Currently, only "pure" (see <b>-e</b> <b>trace</b>=<b>%pure</b> description) syscalls can
                   be specified there.

                   Unless  a  :<b>when</b>=<u>expr</u>  subexpression  is  specified,  an  injection  is being made into every
                   invocation of each syscall from the <u>set</u>.

                   The format of the subexpression is:

                             <u>first</u>[<b>..</b><u>last</u>][<b>+</b>[<u>step</u>]]

                   Number <u>first</u> stands for the first invocation number in the range, number <u>last</u> stands for  the
                   last  invocation  number  in  the range, and <u>step</u> stands for the step between two consecutive
                   invocations.  The following combinations are useful:

                   <u>first</u>             For every syscall from the  <u>set</u>,  perform  an  injection  for  the  syscall
                                     invocation number <u>first</u> only.
                   <u>first</u><b>..</b><u>last</u>       For  every  syscall  from  the  <u>set</u>,  perform  an injection for the syscall
                                     invocation number <u>first</u> and all subsequent invocations until the invocation
                                     number <u>last</u> (inclusive).
                   <u>first</u><b>+</b>            For every  syscall  from  the  <u>set</u>,  perform  injections  for  the  syscall
                                     invocation number <u>first</u> and all subsequent invocations.
                   <u>first</u><b>..</b><u>last</u><b>+</b>      For  every  syscall  from  the  <u>set</u>,  perform  injections  for  the syscall
                                     invocation number <u>first</u> and all subsequent invocations until the invocation
                                     number <u>last</u> (inclusive).
                   <u>first</u><b>+</b><u>step</u>        For every syscall from the <u>set</u>, perform injections for syscall  invocations
                                     number <u>first</u>, <u>first</u>+<u>step</u>, <u>first</u>+<u>step</u>+<u>step</u>, and so on.
                   <u>first</u><b>..</b><u>last</u><b>+</b><u>step</u>  Same as the previous, but consider only syscall invocations with numbers up
                                     to <u>last</u> (inclusive).

                   For   example,   to   fail  each  third  and  subsequent  chdir  syscalls  with  <b>ENOENT</b>,  use
                   <b>-e</b> <b>inject</b>=<u>chdir</u>:<b>error</b>=<u>ENOENT</u>:<b>when</b>=<u>3</u><b>+</b>.

                   The valid range for numbers <u>first</u> and <u>step</u> is 1..65535, and for number <u>last</u> is 1..65534.

                   An injection expression can contain only one <b>error</b>= or <b>retval</b>= specification,  and  only  one
                   <b>signal</b>=  specification.   If  an injection expression contains multiple <b>when</b>= specifications,
                   the last one takes precedence.

                   Accounting of syscalls that are subject to injection is done per syscall and per tracee.

                   Specification of syscall injection can be combined with other syscall filtering options,  for
                   example, <b>-P</b> <u>/dev/urandom</u> <b>-e</b> <b>inject</b>=<u>file</u>:<b>error</b>=<u>ENOENT</u>.

       <b>-e</b> <b>fault</b>=<u>syscall_set</u>[:<b>error</b>=<u>errno</u>][:<b>when</b>=<u>expr</u>]
       <b>--fault</b>=<u>syscall_set</u>[:<b>error</b>=<u>errno</u>][:<b>when</b>=<u>expr</u>]
                   Perform syscall fault injection for the specified set of syscalls.

                   This  is  equivalent to more generic <b>-e</b> <b>inject</b>= expression with default value of <u>errno</u> option
                   set to <b>ENOSYS</b>.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       <b>-d</b>
       <b>--debug</b>     Show some debugging output of <b>strace</b> itself on the standard error.

       <b>-F</b>          This option is deprecated.  It is retained for backward compatibility only and may be removed
                   in future releases.  Usage of multiple instances of <b>-F</b> option is still equivalent to a single
                   <b>-f</b>, and it is ignored at all if used along with one or more instances of <b>-f</b> option.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b>      Print the help summary.

       <b>--seccomp-bpf</b>
                   Try to enable use of seccomp-bpf (see <b><a href="../man2/seccomp.2.html">seccomp</a></b>(2)) to have <b><a href="../man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace</a></b>(2)-stops  only  when  system
                   calls that are being traced occur in the traced processes.

                   This  option  has no effect unless <b>-f</b>/<b>--follow-forks</b> is also specified.  <b>--seccomp-bpf</b> is not
                   compatible with <b>--syscall-limit</b> and <b>-b</b>/<b>--detach-on</b> options.  It is  also  not  applicable  to
                   processes attached using <b>-p</b>/<b>--attach</b> option.

                   An  attempt  to enable system calls filtering using seccomp-bpf may fail for various reasons,
                   e.g. there are too many system calls to filter, the seccomp API is not available,  or  <b>strace</b>
                   itself  is  being  traced.  In cases when seccomp-bpf filter setup failed, <b>strace</b> proceeds as
                   usual and stops traced processes on every system call.

                   When <b>--seccomp-bpf</b> is activated and <b>-p</b>/<b>--attach</b> option is not used, <b>--kill-on-exit</b> option  is
                   activated as well.

                   Note  that  in  cases when the tracee has another seccomp filter that returns an action value
                   with a precedence greater than <b>SECCOMP_RET_TRACE</b>, <b>strace</b> <b>--seccomp-bpf</b> will not be  notified.
                   That  is,  if  another seccomp filter, for example, disables the syscall or kills the tracee,
                   then <b>strace</b> <b>--seccomp-bpf</b> will not be aware of that syscall invocation at all.

       <b>--tips</b>[=[[<b>id:</b>]<u>id</u>],[[<b>format:</b>]<u>format</u>]]
                   Show strace tips, tricks, and tweaks before exit.  <u>id</u> can be a non-negative  integer  number,
                   which  enables  printing  of specific tip, trick, or tweak (these ID are not guaranteed to be
                   stable), or <b>random</b> (the default), in which case a random tip is printed.  <u>format</u> can  be  one
                   of the following:

                   <b>none</b>     No tip is printed.  Can be used to override the previous setting.
                   <b>compact</b>  Print the tip just big enough to contain all the text.
                   <b>full</b>     Print the tip in its full glory.

                   Default is <b>id:random,format:compact</b>.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>   Print  the  version  number  of  <b>strace</b>.   Multiple  instances  of the option beyond specific
                   threshold tend to increase Strauss awareness.

   <b>Time</b> <b>specification</b> <b>format</b> <b>description</b>
       Time values can be specified as a decimal floating point number (in  a  format  accepted  by  <b><a href="../man3/strtod.3.html">strtod</a></b>(3)),
       optionally  followed  by  one  of  the  following suffices that specify the unit of time: <b>s</b> (seconds), <b>ms</b>
       (milliseconds), <b>us</b> (microseconds), or <b>ns</b>  (nanoseconds).   If  no  suffix  is  specified,  the  value  is
       interpreted as microseconds.

       The described format is used for <b>-O</b>, <b>-e</b> <b>inject</b>=<b>delay_enter</b>, and <b>-e</b> <b>inject</b>=<b>delay_exit</b> options.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       When <u>command</u> exits, <b>strace</b> exits with the same exit status.  If <u>command</u> is terminated by a signal, <b>strace</b>
       terminates  itself  with  the same signal, so that <b>strace</b> can be used as a wrapper process transparent to
       the invoking parent process.  Note that parent-child relationship (signal stop notifications,  <b><a href="../man2/getppid.2.html">getppid</a></b>(2)
       value, etc) between traced process and its parent are not preserved unless <b>-D</b> is used.

       When  using <b>-p</b> without a <u>command</u>, the exit status of <b>strace</b> is zero unless no processes has been attached
       or there was an unexpected error in doing the tracing.

</pre><h4><b>SETUID</b> <b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       If <b>strace</b> is installed setuid to root then the invoking  user  will  be  able  to  attach  to  and  trace
       processes owned by any user.  In addition setuid and setgid programs will be executed and traced with the
       correct effective privileges.  Since only users trusted with full root privileges should be allowed to do
       these  things,  it only makes sense to install <b>strace</b> as setuid to root when the users who can execute it
       are restricted to those users who have this trust.  For example, it makes  sense  to  install  a  special
       version  of <b>strace</b> with mode 'rwsr-xr--', user <b>root</b> and group <b>trace</b>, where members of the <b>trace</b> group are
       trusted users.  If you do use this feature, please remember to install a regular  non-setuid  version  of
       <b>strace</b> for ordinary users to use.

</pre><h4><b>MULTIPLE</b> <b>PERSONALITIES</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       On  some  architectures, <b>strace</b> supports decoding of syscalls for processes that use different ABI rather
       than the one <b>strace</b> uses.  Specifically, in addition to  decoding  native  ABI,  <b>strace</b>  can  decode  the
       following ABIs on the following architectures:
       ┌────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
       │ <b>Architecture</b>       │ <b>ABIs</b> <b>supported</b>          │
       ├────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
       │ x86_64             │ i386, x32 [1]; i386 [2] │
       ├────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
       │ AArch64            │ ARM 32-bit EABI         │
       ├────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
       │ PowerPC 64-bit [3] │ PowerPC 32-bit          │
       ├────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
       │ s390x              │ s390                    │
       ├────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
       │ SPARC 64-bit       │ SPARC 32-bit            │
       ├────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
       │ TILE 64-bit        │ TILE 32-bit             │
       └────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘

       [1]  When <b>strace</b> is built as an x86_64 application
       [2]  When <b>strace</b> is built as an x32 application
       [3]  Big endian only

       This  support  is  optional  and relies on ability to generate and parse structure definitions during the
       build time.  Please refer to the output of the <b>strace</b> <b>-V</b> command in order to figure out what  support  is
       available in your <b>strace</b> build ("non-native" refers to an ABI that differs from the ABI <b>strace</b> has):

       <b>m32-mpers</b>      <b>strace</b> can trace and properly decode non-native 32-bit binaries.
       <b>no-m32-mpers</b>   <b>strace</b> can trace, but cannot properly decode non-native 32-bit binaries.
       <b>mx32-mpers</b>     <b>strace</b> can trace and properly decode non-native 32-on-64-bit binaries.
       <b>no-mx32-mpers</b>  <b>strace</b> can trace, but cannot properly decode non-native 32-on-64-bit binaries.

       If the output contains neither <b>m32-mpers</b> nor <b>no-m32-mpers</b>, then decoding of non-native 32-bit binaries is
       not implemented at all or not applicable.

       Likewise,  if  the  output  contains  neither  <b>mx32-mpers</b>  nor <b>no-mx32-mpers</b>, then decoding of non-native
       32-on-64-bit binaries is not implemented at all or not applicable.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       It is a pity that so much tracing clutter is produced by systems employing shared libraries.

       It is instructive to think about system call inputs and  outputs  as  data-flow  across  the  user/kernel
       boundary.   Because  user-space  and  kernel-space  are  separate  and address-protected, it is sometimes
       possible to make deductive inferences about process behavior using inputs and outputs as propositions.

       In some cases, a system call will differ from the documented behavior or  have  a  different  name.   For
       example, the <b><a href="../man2/faccessat.2.html">faccessat</a></b>(2) system call does not have <u>flags</u> argument, and the <b><a href="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</a></b>(2) library function
       uses  <b><a href="../man2/prlimit64.2.html">prlimit64</a></b>(2)  system  call  on  modern  (2.6.38+)  kernels.   These  discrepancies  are  normal but
       idiosyncratic characteristics of the system call interface and are accounted for  by  C  library  wrapper
       functions.

       Some  system  calls  have  different names in different architectures and personalities.  In these cases,
       system call filtering and printing uses the names that match corresponding <b>__NR_</b>* kernel  macros  of  the
       tracee's   architecture   and   personality.    There   are   two  exceptions  from  this  general  rule:
       <b><a href="../man2/arm_fadvise64_64.2.html">arm_fadvise64_64</a></b>(2) ARM syscall and <b><a href="../man2/xtensa_fadvise64_64.2.html">xtensa_fadvise64_64</a></b>(2) Xtensa syscall are  filtered  and  printed  as
       <b><a href="../man2/fadvise64_64.2.html">fadvise64_64</a></b>(2).

       On  x32,  syscalls  that  are  intended  to  be  used  by 64-bit processes and not x32 ones (for example,
       <b><a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a></b>(2), that has syscall number 19 on x86_64, with its x32 counterpart has  syscall  number  515),  but
       called with <b>__X32_SYSCALL_BIT</b> flag being set, are designated with <b>#64</b> suffix.

       On  some  platforms  a process that is attached to with the <b>-p</b> option may observe a spurious <b>EINTR</b> return
       from the current system call that is not restartable.  (Ideally, all system calls should be restarted  on
       <b>strace</b>  attach,  making  the  attach  invisible  to  the  traced  process, but a few system calls aren't.
       Arguably, every instance of such behavior is a kernel bug.)  This may have an unpredictable effect on the
       process if the process takes no action to restart the system call.

       As <b>strace</b> executes the specified <u>command</u> directly and does not employ a shell for that,  scripts  without
       shebang  that  usually  run  just  fine  when invoked by shell fail to execute with <b>ENOEXEC</b> error.  It is
       advisable to manually supply a shell as a <u>command</u> with the script as its argument.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Programs that use the <u>setuid</u> bit do not have effective user ID privileges while being traced.

       A traced process runs slowly (but check out the <b>--seccomp-bpf</b> option).

       Unless  <b>--kill-on-exit</b>  option  is  used  (or  <b>--seccomp-bpf</b>  option  is  used  in  a  way  that  implies
       <b>--kill-on-exit</b>), traced processes which are descended from <u>command</u> may be left running after an interrupt
       signal (<b>CTRL-C</b>).

       By  using  <b>CLONE_UNTRACED</b>  flag  of <b>clone</b> system call a tracee can break the guarantee that <b>--seccomp-bpf</b>
       will not leave any processes with a seccomp program installed for syscall filtering purposes.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The original <b>strace</b> was written by Paul Kranenburg for SunOS and was inspired by its <b>trace</b> utility.   The
       SunOS  version  of  <b>strace</b> was ported to Linux and enhanced by Branko Lankester, who also wrote the Linux
       kernel support.  Even though Paul released <b>strace</b> 2.5 in 1992, Branko's work was based on  Paul's  <b>strace</b>
       1.5  release  from  1991.   In  1993,  Rick Sladkey merged <b>strace</b> 2.5 for SunOS and the second release of
       <b>strace</b> for Linux, added many of the features of <b><a href="../man1/truss.1.html">truss</a></b>(1) from SVR4, and produced an <b>strace</b> that worked on
       both platforms.  In 1994 Rick ported <b>strace</b> to SVR4 and Solaris and  wrote  the  automatic  configuration
       support.  In 1995 he ported <b>strace</b> to Irix and became tired of writing about himself in the third person.

       Beginning  with  1996,  <b>strace</b> was maintained by Wichert Akkerman.  During his tenure, <b>strace</b> development
       migrated to CVS; ports to FreeBSD and many architectures on Linux (including ARM, IA-64,  MIPS,  PA-RISC,
       PowerPC,  s390,  SPARC) were introduced.  In 2002, the burden of <b>strace</b> maintainership was transferred to
       Roland McGrath.  Since then, <b>strace</b> gained support for several new  Linux  architectures  (AMD64,  s390x,
       SuperH),  bi-architecture  support  for some of them, and received numerous additions and improvements in
       syscalls decoders on Linux; <b>strace</b> development migrated to <b>Git</b> during that period.  Since 2009, <b>strace</b> is
       actively maintained by Dmitry Levin.  <b>strace</b> gained support for AArch64, ARC, AVR32, Blackfin, Meta, Nios
       II, OpenRISC 1000, RISC-V, Tile/TileGx, Xtensa architectures since that time.  In 2012, unmaintained  and
       apparently  broken  support  for  non-Linux  operating  systems was removed.  Also, in 2012 <b>strace</b> gained
       support for path tracing and file descriptor path decoding.  In 2014, support for  stack  trace  printing
       was added.  In 2016, syscall fault injection was implemented.

       For the additional information, please refer to the <b>NEWS</b> file and <b>strace</b> repository commit log.
