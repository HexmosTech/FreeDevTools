</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       maybe - see what a command does before applying its changes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>maybe</b> &lt;<u>command</u>&gt; [&lt;<u>options</u>&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>maybe</b>  runs the given <u>command</u> and intercepts any filesystems changes it attempts to make, indicating that
       they succeed without actually applying the changes. Once <u>command</u> has  finished,  <b>maybe</b>  reports  all  the
       changes attempted, and if there were any such changes, offers to re-run <u>command</u> without filtering them.

       <b>maybe</b> should never be used to check untrusted code since only a few system calls are blocked.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>maybe</b> was written by Philipp Emanuel Weidmann.

       This  manual page was written by Stephen Kitt &lt;<a href="mailto:skitt@debian.org">skitt@debian.org</a>&gt; for the Debian GNU/Linux system (but may
       be used by others).
