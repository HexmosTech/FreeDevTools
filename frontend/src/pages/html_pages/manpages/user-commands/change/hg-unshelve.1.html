       hg unshelve - restore a shelved change to the working directory

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       hg unshelve [OPTION]... [[-n] SHELVED]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  command  accepts an optional name of a shelved change to restore. If none is given, the most recent
       shelved change is used.

       If a shelved change is applied successfully, the bundle that contains the shelved changes is moved  to  a
       backup location (.hg/shelve-backup).

       Since you can restore a shelved change on top of an arbitrary commit, it is possible that unshelving will
       result  in  a  conflict between your changes and the commits you are unshelving onto. If this occurs, you
       must resolve the conflict, then use <b>--continue</b> to complete the unshelve operation. (The bundle  will  not
       be moved until you successfully complete the unshelve.)

       (Alternatively,  you  can  use  <b>--abort</b>  to  abandon an unshelve that causes a conflict. This reverts the
       unshelved changes, and leaves the bundle in place.)

       If bare shelved change (without interactive, include and exclude option) was done on newly created branch
       it would restore branch information to the working directory.

       After a successful unshelve, the shelved changes are stored in a backup directory. Only the N most recent
       backups are kept. N defaults to 10 but  can  be  overridden  using  the  <b>shelve.maxbackups</b>  configuration
       option.

       Timestamp  in  seconds is used to decide order of backups. More than <b>maxbackups</b> backups are kept, if same
       timestamp prevents from deciding exact order of them, for safety.

       Selected changes can be unshelved with <b>--interactive</b> flag.  The working directory  is  updated  with  the
       selected  changes,  and only the unselected changes remain shelved.  Note: The whole shelve is applied to
       working directory first before running interactively. So, this will bring up all  the  conflicts  between
       working directory and the shelve, irrespective of which changes will be unshelved.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

              use interactive mode (EXPERIMENTAL)

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--keep</b>
              keep shelve after unshelving

       <b>-n,</b><u>--name</u> <b>&lt;NAME&gt;</b>

                                                                                                    <u>HG</u>(UNSHELVE)
