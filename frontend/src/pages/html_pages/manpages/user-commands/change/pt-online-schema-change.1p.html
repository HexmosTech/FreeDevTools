</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pt-online-schema-change - ALTER tables without locking them.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: pt-online-schema-change [OPTIONS] DSN

       pt-online-schema-change alters a table's structure without blocking reads or writes.  Specify the
       database and table in the DSN. Do not use this tool before reading its documentation and checking your
       backups carefully.

       Add a column to sakila.actor:

         pt-online-schema-change --alter "ADD COLUMN c1 INT" D=sakila,t=actor

       Change sakila.actor to InnoDB, effectively performing OPTIMIZE TABLE in a non-blocking fashion because it
       is already an InnoDB table:

         pt-online-schema-change --alter "ENGINE=InnoDB" D=sakila,t=actor

</pre><h4><b>RISKS</b></h4><pre>
       Percona Toolkit is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested, but all database tools can pose a
       risk to the system and the database server.  Before using this tool, please:

       •   Read the tool's documentation

       •   Review the tool's known "BUGS"

       •   Test the tool on a non-production server

       •   Backup your production server and verify the backups

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pt-online-schema-change  emulates  the way that MySQL alters tables internally, but it works on a copy of
       the table you wish to alter. This means that the original table is not locked, and clients  may  continue
       to read and change data in it.

       pt-online-schema-change  works  by creating an empty copy of the table to alter, modifying it as desired,
       and then copying rows from the original table into the new table. When the copy  is  complete,  it  moves
       away the original table and replaces it with the new one.  By default, it also drops the original table.

       The  data  copy  process  is  performed in small chunks of data, which are varied to attempt to make them
       execute in a specific amount of time (see "--chunk-time").  This process is very  similar  to  how  other
       tools, such as pt-table-checksum, work.  Any modifications to data in the original tables during the copy
       will be reflected in the new table, because the tool creates triggers on the original table to update the
       corresponding  rows  in  the  new  table.   The  use of triggers means that the tool will not work if any
       triggers are already defined on the table.

       When the tool finishes copying data into the new table, it uses an atomic  "RENAME  TABLE"  operation  to
       simultaneously  rename  the original and new tables.  After this is complete, the tool drops the original
       table.

       Foreign keys complicate the tool's operation and introduce additional risk.  The technique of  atomically
       renaming  the  original  and new tables does not work when foreign keys refer to the table. The tool must
       update foreign keys to refer to the new table after the schema change is complete. The tool supports  two
       methods   for   accomplishing   this.   You   can   read   more  about  this  in  the  documentation  for
       "--alter-foreign-keys-method".

       Foreign keys also cause some side effects. The final table will have the same foreign keys and indexes as
       the original table (unless you specify differently in your ALTER statement), but the names of the objects
       may be changed slightly to avoid object name collisions in MySQL and InnoDB.

       For safety, the tool does not modify the table unless you specify the "--execute" option,  which  is  not
       enabled  by  default.   The  tool  supports a variety of other measures to prevent unwanted load or other
       problems, including automatically detecting replicas, connecting to them, and using the following  safety
       checks:

       •   In  most cases the tool will refuse to operate unless a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE INDEX is present in the
           table. See "--alter" for details.

       •   The tool refuses to operate if it detects replication filters. See  "--[no]check-replication-filters"
           for details.

       •   The  tool pauses the data copy operation if it observes any replicas that are delayed in replication.
           See "--max-lag" for details.

       •   The tool pauses or aborts its operation if it detects too much load on the server.  See  "--max-load"
           and "--critical-load" for details.

       •   The  tool  sets  "innodb_lock_wait_timeout=1" and (for MySQL 5.5 and newer) "lock_wait_timeout=60" so
           that it is more likely to be the victim of any lock contention, and  less  likely  to  disrupt  other
           transactions.  These values can be changed by specifying "--set-vars".

       •   The  tool  refuses  to  alter  the  table if foreign key constraints reference it, unless you specify
           "--alter-foreign-keys-method".

       •   The tool cannot alter MyISAM tables on "Percona XtraDB Cluster" nodes.

</pre><h4><b>Percona</b> <b>XtraDB</b> <b>Cluster</b></h4><pre>
       pt-online-schema-change works with Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC) 5.5.28-23.7 and newer, but there are  two
       limitations:  only InnoDB tables can be altered, and "wsrep_OSU_method" must be set to "TOI" (total order
       isolation).  The tool exits with an error if the host is a cluster node and the table  is  MyISAM  or  is
       being  converted  to MyISAM ("ENGINE=MyISAM"), or if "wsrep_OSU_method" is not "TOI".  There is no way to
       disable these checks.

</pre><h4><b>MySQL</b> <b>5.7</b> <b>+</b> <b>Generated</b> <b>columns</b></h4><pre>
       The tools ignores MySQL 5.7+ "GENERATED" columns since the value for those columns is generated according
       to the expression used to compute column values.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The tool prints information about its activities to STDOUT so that you can see what it is doing.   During
       the  data  copy  phase,  it prints "--progress" reports to STDERR.  You can get additional information by
       specifying "--print".

       If "--statistics" is specified, a report of various internal event counts is printed at the end, like:

          # Event  Count
          # ====== =====
          # INSERT     1

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       "--dry-run" and "--execute" are mutually exclusive.

       This tool accepts additional command-line arguments.  Refer to the "SYNOPSIS" and usage  information  for
       details.

       --alter
           type: string

           The  schema modification, without the ALTER TABLE keywords. You can perform multiple modifications to
           the table by specifying them with commas. Please refer to the MySQL manual for the  syntax  of  ALTER
           TABLE.

           The  following  limitations  apply  which, if attempted, will cause the tool to fail in unpredictable
           ways:

           •   In almost all cases a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE INDEX needs to be present  in  the  table.   This  is
               necessary  because  the  tool  creates  a  DELETE trigger to keep the new table updated while the
               process is running.

               A notable exception is when a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE INDEX is being created from <b>existing</b>  <b>columns</b>
               as part of the ALTER clause; in that case it will use these column(s) for the DELETE trigger.

           •   The "RENAME" clause cannot be used to rename the table.

           •   Columns  cannot  be  renamed by dropping and re-adding with the new name.  The tool will not copy
               the original column's data to the new column.

           •   If you add a column without a default value and make it NOT NULL, the tool will fail, as it  will
               not try to guess a default value for you; You must specify the default.

           •   "DROP  FOREIGN  KEY  constraint_name" requires specifying "_constraint_name" rather than the real
               "constraint_name".  Due  to  a  limitation  in  MySQL,  pt-online-schema-change  adds  a  leading
               underscore  to  foreign  key  constraint names when creating the new table.  For example, to drop
               this constraint:

                 CONSTRAINT `fk_foo` FOREIGN KEY (`foo_id`) REFERENCES `bar` (`foo_id`)

               You must specify "--alter "DROP FOREIGN KEY _fk_foo"".

           •   The tool does not use "LOCK IN SHARE MODE" with MySQL 5.0 because it  can  cause  a  slave  error
               which breaks replication:

                  Query caused different errors on master and slave. Error on master:
                  'Deadlock found when trying to get lock; try restarting transaction' (1213),
                  Error on slave: 'no error' (0). Default database: 'pt_osc'.
                  Query: 'INSERT INTO pt_osc.t (id, c) VALUES ('730', 'new row')'

               The  error  happens  when converting a MyISAM table to InnoDB because MyISAM is non-transactional
               but InnoDB is transactional.  MySQL 5.1  and  newer  handle  this  case  correctly,  but  testing
               reproduces the error 5% of the time with MySQL 5.0.

               This  is a MySQL bug, similar to &lt;<a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php">http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php</a>?id=45694&gt;, but there is no fix or
               workaround in MySQL 5.0.  Without "LOCK IN SHARE MODE", tests pass 100% of the time, so the  risk
               of data loss or breaking replication should be negligible.

               <b>Be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>verify</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>table</b> <b>if</b> <b>using</b> <b>MySQL</b> <b>5.0</b> <b>and</b> <b>converting</b> <b>from</b> <b>MyISAM</b> <b>to</b> <b>InnoDB!</b>

       --alter-foreign-keys-method
           type: string

           How to modify foreign keys so they reference the new table.  Foreign keys that reference the table to
           be  altered  must  be  treated specially to ensure that they continue to reference the correct table.
           When the tool renames the original table to let the new one take its place, the foreign keys "follow"
           the renamed table, and must be changed to reference the new table instead.

           The tool supports two techniques  to  achieve  this.  It  automatically  finds  "child  tables"  that
           reference the table to be altered.

           auto
               Automatically  determine  which  method is best.  The tool uses "rebuild_constraints" if possible
               (see the description of that method for details), and if not, then it uses "drop_swap".

           rebuild_constraints
               This method uses "ALTER TABLE" to drop and re-add foreign key constraints that reference the  new
               table.   This  is  the  preferred technique, unless one or more of the "child" tables is so large
               that the "ALTER" would take too long.  The tool determines that by comparing the number  of  rows
               in  the  child table to the rate at which the tool is able to copy rows from the old table to the
               new table. If the tool estimates that the child table can  be  altered  in  less  time  than  the
               "--chunk-time", then it will use this technique.  For purposes of estimating the time required to
               alter  the child table, the tool multiplies the row-copying rate by "--chunk-size-limit", because
               MySQL's "ALTER TABLE" is typically much faster than the external process of copying rows.

               Due to a limitation in MySQL, foreign keys will not have the same names after the ALTER that they
               did prior to it. The tool has to rename the foreign key  when  it  redefines  it,  which  adds  a
               leading  underscore to the name. In some cases, MySQL also automatically renames indexes required
               for the foreign key.

           drop_swap
               Disable foreign key checks (FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0), then drop the original table  before  renaming
               the  new  table  into its place. This is different from the normal method of swapping the old and
               new table, which uses an atomic "RENAME" that is undetectable to client applications.

               This method is faster and does not block, but it is riskier for two reasons.  First, for a  short
               time  between  dropping  the  original  table  and  renaming the temporary table, the table to be
               altered simply does not exist, and queries against it will result  in  an  error.   Secondly,  if
               there  is  an error and the new table cannot be renamed into the place of the old one, then it is
               too late to abort, because the old table is gone permanently.

               This method forces "--no-swap-tables" and "--no-drop-old-table".

           none
               This method is like "drop_swap" without  the  "swap".   Any  foreign  keys  that  referenced  the
               original  table  will  now  reference  a nonexistent table. This will typically cause foreign key
               violations that are visible in "SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS", similar to the following:

                  Trying to add to index `idx_fk_staff_id` tuple:
                  DATA TUPLE: 2 fields;
                  0: len 1; hex 05; asc  ;;
                  1: len 4; hex 80000001; asc     ;;
                  But the parent table `sakila`.`staff_old`
                  or its .ibd file does not currently exist!

               This is because the original table (in this case, sakila.staff) was renamed  to  sakila.staff_old
               and  then  dropped.  This  method  of  handling  foreign  key constraints is provided so that the
               database administrator can disable the tool's built-in functionality if desired.

       --[no]analyze-before-swap
           default: yes

           Execute ANALYZE TABLE on the new table before swapping with the old one.  By  default,  this  happens
           only  when  running MySQL 5.6 and newer, and "innodb_stats_persistent" is enabled. Specify the option
           explicitly to enable or disable it regardless of MySQL version and "innodb_stats_persistent".

           This circumvents a potentially serious issue related to InnoDB optimizer  statistics.  If  the  table
           being  alerted  is  busy  and  the  tool  completes  quickly,  the  new table will not have optimizer
           statistics after being swapped. This can cause fast, index-using queries to do full table scans until
           optimizer statistics are updated (usually after 10 seconds). If the table is  large  and  the  server
           very busy, this can cause an outage.

       --ask-pass
           Prompt for a password when connecting to MySQL.

       --channel
           type: string

           Channel  name  used  when  connected  to  a  server using replication channels.  Suppose you have two
           masters, master_a at port 12345, master_b at port 1236 and a slave connected to  both  masters  using
           channels  chan_master_a and chan_master_b.  If you want to run pt-table-sync to synchronize the slave
           against master_a, pt-table-sync won't be able to determine what's the correct master since SHOW SLAVE
           STATUS will return 2 rows. In this case, you can use --channel=chan_master_a to specify  the  channel
           name to use in the SHOW SLAVE STATUS command.

       --charset
           short form: -A; type: string

           Default  character  set.   If  the  value  is utf8, sets Perl's binmode on STDOUT to utf8, passes the
           mysql_enable_utf8 option to DBD::mysql, and runs SET NAMES UTF8 after connecting to MySQL.  Any other
           value sets binmode on STDOUT without the utf8 layer, and runs SET NAMES after connecting to MySQL.

       --[no]check-alter
           default: yes

           Parses the "--alter" specified and tries to warn  of  possible  unintended  behavior.  Currently,  it
           checks for:

           Column renames
               In previous versions of the tool, renaming a column with "CHANGE COLUMN name new_name" would lead
               to  that  column's  data  being lost.  The tool now parses the alter statement and tries to catch
               these cases, so the renamed columns should have the same data as the originals. However, the code
               that does this is not a full-blown SQL parser, so you should first run the tool with  "--dry-run"
               and "--print" and verify that it detects the renamed columns correctly.

           DROP PRIMARY KEY
               If  "--alter"  contain "DROP PRIMARY KEY" (case- and space-insensitive), a warning is printed and
               the tool exits unless "--dry-run" is specified.  Altering the primary key can be  dangerous,  but
               the  tool can handle it.  The tool's triggers, particularly the DELETE trigger, are most affected
               by altering the primary key because the tool prefers to use the primary  key  for  its  triggers.
               You  should  first  run  the tool with "--dry-run" and "--print" and verify that the triggers are
               correct.

       --[no]check-foreign-keys
           default: yes

           Check for self-referencing foreign keys. Currently self referencing FKs are not full  supported,  so,
           to  prevent  errors,  this program won't run if the table has self-referencing foreign keys. Use this
           parameter to disable self-referencing FK checks.

       --check-interval
           type: time; default: 1

           Sleep time between checks for "--max-lag".

       --[no]check-plan
           default: yes

           Check query execution plans for safety. By default, this option causes the tool to run EXPLAIN before
           running queries that are meant to access a small amount of data, but which could access many rows  if
           MySQL  chooses  a bad execution plan. These include the queries to determine chunk boundaries and the
           chunk queries themselves. If it appears that MySQL will use a bad query execution plan, the tool will
           skip the chunk of the table.

           The tool uses several heuristics to determine whether an execution plan is bad.  The first is whether
           EXPLAIN reports that MySQL intends to use the desired index to access the rows. If  MySQL  chooses  a
           different index, the tool considers the query unsafe.

           The  tool also checks how much of the index MySQL reports that it will use for the query. The EXPLAIN
           output shows this in the key_len column. The tool remembers  the  largest  key_len  seen,  and  skips
           chunks  where  MySQL  reports  that  it will use a smaller prefix of the index. This heuristic can be
           understood as skipping chunks that have a worse execution plan than other chunks.

           The tool prints a warning the first time a chunk is skipped due to  a  bad  execution  plan  in  each
           table.  Subsequent  chunks  are skipped silently, although you can see the count of skipped chunks in
           the SKIPPED column in the tool's output.

           This option adds some setup work to each table and chunk. Although the  work  is  not  intrusive  for
           MySQL,  it  results  in  more round-trips to the server, which consumes time. Making chunks too small
           will cause the overhead to become relatively larger. It is therefore recommended that  you  not  make
           chunks too small, because the tool may take a very long time to complete if you do.

       --[no]check-replication-filters
           default: yes

           Abort  if any replication filter is set on any server.  The tool looks for server options that filter
           replication, such as binlog_ignore_db and replicate_do_db.  If it finds any such filters,  it  aborts
           with an error.

           If  the  replicas  are configured with any filtering options, you should be careful not to modify any
           databases or tables that exist on the master and not the replicas, because it could cause replication
           to      fail.       For      more       information       on       replication       rules,       see
           &lt;<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/replication-rules.html">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/replication-rules.html</a>&gt;.

       --check-slave-lag
           type: string

           Pause  the  data  copy  until  this  replica's lag is less than "--max-lag".  The value is a DSN that
           inherits properties from  the  the  connection  options  ("--port",  "--user",  etc.).   This  option
           overrides  the normal behavior of finding and continually monitoring replication lag on ALL connected
           replicas.  If you don't want to monitor ALL replicas, but you want more than just one replica  to  be
           monitored, then use the DSN option to the "--recursion-method" option instead of this option.

       --chunk-index
           type: string

           Prefer  this  index for chunking tables.  By default, the tool chooses the most appropriate index for
           chunking.  This option lets you specify the index that you prefer.  If the index doesn't exist,  then
           the tool will fall back to its default behavior of choosing an index.  The tool adds the index to the
           SQL  statements in a "FORCE INDEX" clause.  Be careful when using this option; a poor choice of index
           could cause bad performance.

       --chunk-index-columns
           type: int

           Use only this many left-most columns of a "--chunk-index".  This works only for compound indexes, and
           is useful in cases where a bug in the MySQL query optimizer (planner) causes it to scan a large range
           of rows instead of using the index to locate starting and  ending  points  precisely.   This  problem
           sometimes  occurs  on  indexes with many columns, such as 4 or more.  If this happens, the tool might
           print a warning related to the "--[no]check-plan" option.  Instructing the tool to use only the first
           N columns of the index is a workaround for the bug in some cases.

       --chunk-size
           type: size; default: 1000

           Number of rows to select for each chunk copied.  Allowable suffixes are k, M, G.

           This option can override the default behavior, which is to adjust chunk size dynamically  to  try  to
           make  chunks  run  in  exactly  "--chunk-time"  seconds.   When this option isn't set explicitly, its
           default value is used as a starting point, but after that, the tool ignores this option's value.   If
           you  set  this option explicitly, however, then it disables the dynamic adjustment behavior and tries
           to make all chunks exactly the specified number of rows.

           There is a subtlety: if the chunk index is not unique, then it's possible that chunks will be  larger
           than  desired.  For example, if a table is chunked by an index that contains 10,000 of a given value,
           there is no way to write a WHERE clause that matches only 1,000 of the values, and that chunk will be
           at least 10,000 rows large.  Such a chunk will probably be skipped because of "--chunk-size-limit".

       --chunk-size-limit
           type: float; default: 4.0

           Do not copy chunks this much larger than the desired chunk size.

           When a table has no unique indexes, chunk sizes can be inaccurate.  This option specifies  a  maximum
           tolerable  limit  to  the  inaccuracy.   The tool uses &lt;EXPLAIN&gt; to estimate how many rows are in the
           chunk.  If that estimate exceeds the desired chunk size times the limit,  then  the  tool  skips  the
           chunk.

           The  minimum value for this option is 1, which means that no chunk can be larger than "--chunk-size".
           You probably don't want to specify 1, because rows reported by EXPLAIN are estimates,  which  can  be
           different  from  the  real  number of rows in the chunk.  You can disable oversized chunk checking by
           specifying a value of 0.

           The tool also uses this option to determine how to handle foreign keys that reference the table to be
           altered. See "--alter-foreign-keys-method" for details.

       --chunk-time
           type: float; default: 0.5

           Adjust the chunk size dynamically so each data-copy query takes  this  long  to  execute.   The  tool
           tracks the copy rate (rows per second) and adjusts the chunk size after each data-copy query, so that
           the next query takes this amount of time (in seconds) to execute.  It keeps an exponentially decaying
           moving  average  of queries per second, so that if the server's performance changes due to changes in
           server load, the tool adapts quickly.

           If this option is set to zero, the chunk size doesn't auto-adjust, so  query  times  will  vary,  but
           query chunk sizes will not. Another way to do the same thing is to specify a value for "--chunk-size"
           explicitly, instead of leaving it at the default.

       --config
           type: Array

           Read  this  comma-separated  list of config files; if specified, this must be the first option on the
           command line.

       --critical-load
           type: Array; default: Threads_running=50

           Examine SHOW GLOBAL STATUS after every chunk, and abort if the load is too high.  The option  accepts
           a  comma-separated  list  of  MySQL  status  variables  and thresholds.  An optional "=MAX_VALUE" (or
           ":MAX_VALUE") can follow each variable.  If not given, the tool determines a threshold  by  examining
           the current value at startup and doubling it.

           See  "--max-load"  for  further  details.  These options work similarly, except that this option will
           abort the tool's operation instead of pausing it, and the default value is  computed  differently  if
           you  specify  no  threshold.  The reason for this option is as a safety check in case the triggers on
           the original table add so much load to the server that it causes  downtime.   There  is  probably  no
           single  value  of Threads_running that is wrong for every server, but a default of 50 seems likely to
           be unacceptably high for most servers, indicating that the operation should be canceled immediately.

       --database
           short form: -D; type: string

           Connect to this database.

       --default-engine
           Remove "ENGINE" from the new table.

           By default the new table is created with the same table options as the  original  table,  so  if  the
           original  table  uses  InnoDB,  then  the  new  table  will  use  InnoDB.  In certain cases involving
           replication, this may cause unintended changes on replicas which use a different engine for the  same
           table.  Specifying this option causes the new table to be created with the system's default engine.

       --data-dir
           type: string

           Create  the  new  table on a different partition using the DATA DIRECTORY feature.  Only available on
           5.6+. This parameter is ignored if it is used at the same time than remove-data-dir.

       --remove-data-dir
           default: no

           If the original table was created using the DATA DIRECTORY feature, remove  it  and  create  the  new
           table in MySQL default directory without creating a new isl file.

       --defaults-file
           short form: -F; type: string

           Only read mysql options from the given file.  You must give an absolute pathname.

       --[no]drop-new-table
           default: yes

           Drop the new table if copying the original table fails.

           Specifying  "--no-drop-new-table"  and  "--no-swap-tables"  leaves the new, altered copy of the table
           without modifying the original table.  See "--new-table-name".

           --no-drop-new-table does not work with "alter-foreign-keys-method drop_swap".

       --[no]drop-old-table
           default: yes

           Drop the original table after renaming it. After the original table has been successfully renamed  to
           let  the  new  table take its place, and if there are no errors, the tool drops the original table by
           default. If there are any errors, the tool leaves the original table in place.

           If "--no-swap-tables" is specified, then there is no old table to drop.

       --[no]drop-triggers
           default: yes

           Drop triggers on the old table.  "--no-drop-triggers" forces "--no-drop-old-table".

       --dry-run
           Create and alter the new table, but do not create triggers, copy data, or replace the original table.

       --execute
           Indicate that you have read the documentation and want to alter the table.   You  must  specify  this
           option  to  alter  the  table.  If you do not, then the tool will only perform some safety checks and
           exit.  This helps ensure that you have read the documentation and understand how to  use  this  tool.
           If you have not read the documentation, then do not specify this option.

       --[no]check-unique-key-change
           default: yes

           Avoid  "pt-online-schema-change"  to run if the specified statement for "--alter" is trying to add an
           unique index.  Since "pt-online-schema-change" uses "INSERT IGNORE" to copy rows to the new table, if
           the row being written produces a duplicate key, it will fail silently and data will be lost.

           Example:

               CREATE DATABASE test;
               USE test;
               CREATE TABLE `a` (
                 `id` <a href="../man11/int.11.html">int</a>(11) NOT NULL,
                 `unique_id` <a href="../man32/varchar.32.html">varchar</a>(32) DEFAULT NULL,
                 PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
               ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;

               insert into a values (1, "a");
               insert into a values (2, "b");
               insert into a values (3, "");
               insert into a values (4, "");
               insert into a values (5, NULL);
               insert into a values (6, NULL);

           Using "pt-online-schema-change" to add an unique index on the "unique_id" field, will cause some rows
           to be lost due to the use of "INSERT IGNORE" to copy rows from the source table.   For  this  reason,
           "pt-online-schema-change"  will  fail  if it detects that the "--alter" parameter is trying to add an
           unique key and it will show an example query to run to detect if there are  rows  that  will  produce
           duplicated indexes.

           Even  if  you  run  the  query  and there are no rows that will produce duplicated indexes, take into
           consideration that after running this query, changes can be  made  to  the  table  that  can  produce
           duplicate rows and this data will be lost.

       --force
           This  options  bypasses  confirmation in case of using alter-foreign-keys-method = none , which might
           break foreign key constraints.

       --help
           Show help and exit.

       --host
           short form: -h; type: string

           Connect to host.

       --max-flow-ctl
           type: float

           Somewhat similar to --max-lag but for PXC clusters.  Check average time  cluster  spent  pausing  for
           Flow  Control and make tool pause if it goes over the percentage indicated in the option.  A value of
           0 would make the tool pause when *any* Flow Control activity is detected.  Default is no Flow Control
           checking.  This option is available for PXC versions 5.6 or higher.

       --max-lag
           type: time; default: 1s

           Pause the data copy until all replicas' lag is less than this  value.   After  each  data-copy  query
           (each  chunk),  the  tool  looks  at  the replication lag of all replicas to which it connects, using
           Seconds_Behind_Master. If any replica is lagging more than the value of this option,  then  the  tool
           will  sleep  for  "--check-interval"  seconds,  then  check  all  replicas  again.   If  you  specify
           "--check-slave-lag", then the tool only examines that server for lag, not all servers.  If  you  want
           to control exactly which servers the tool monitors, use the DSN value to "--recursion-method".

           The  tool  waits  forever  for  replicas  to stop lagging.  If any replica is stopped, the tool waits
           forever until the replica is started.  The data copy continues when all replicas are running and  not
           lagging too much.

           The tool prints progress reports while waiting.  If a replica is stopped, it prints a progress report
           immediately, then again at every progress report interval.

       --max-load
           type: Array; default: Threads_running=25

           Examine SHOW GLOBAL STATUS after every chunk, and pause if any status variables are higher than their
           thresholds.   The  option  accepts  a  comma-separated  list  of MySQL status variables.  An optional
           "=MAX_VALUE" (or ":MAX_VALUE") can follow each  variable.   If  not  given,  the  tool  determines  a
           threshold by examining the current value and increasing it by 20%.

           For  example,  if  you  want  the tool to pause when Threads_connected gets too high, you can specify
           "Threads_connected", and the tool will check the current value when it starts working and add 20%  to
           that  value.   If  the  current value is 100, then the tool will pause when Threads_connected exceeds
           120, and resume working when it is below 120 again.  If you want to specify  an  explicit  threshold,
           such as 110, you can use either "Threads_connected:110" or "Threads_connected=110".

           The  purpose  of  this  option is to prevent the tool from adding too much load to the server. If the
           data-copy queries are intrusive, or if they cause lock waits, then other queries on the  server  will
           tend  to  block  and  queue.  This will typically cause Threads_running to increase, and the tool can
           detect that by running SHOW GLOBAL STATUS immediately after each query finishes.  If  you  specify  a
           threshold  for  this  variable,  then  you  can  instruct  the tool to wait until queries are running
           normally again.  This will not prevent queueing, however; it will only give the server  a  chance  to
           recover from the queueing.  If you notice queueing, it is best to decrease the chunk time.

       --preserve-triggers
           Preserves old triggers when specified.  As of MySQL 5.7.2, it is possible to define multiple triggers
           for  a  given  table  that  have  the  same  trigger event and action time. This allows us to add the
           triggers needed for "pt-online-schema-change" even if the table already has  its  own  triggers.   If
           this  option  is enabled, "pt-online-schema-change" will try to copy all the existing triggers to the
           new table BEFORE start copying rows from the original table to ensure the old triggers can be applied
           after altering the table.

           Example.

             CREATE TABLE test.t1 (
                  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
                  f1 INT,
                  f2 <a href="../man32/VARCHAR.32.html">VARCHAR</a>(32),
                  PRIMARY KEY (id)
             );

             CREATE TABLE test.log (
                ts  TIMESTAMP,
                msg <a href="../man255/VARCHAR.255.html">VARCHAR</a>(255)
             );

             CREATE TRIGGER test.after_update
              AFTER
                UPDATE ON test.t1
                FOR EACH ROW
                  INSERT INTO test.log VALUES (NOW(), CONCAT("updated row row with id ", OLD.id, " old f1:", OLD.f1, " new f1: ", NEW.f1 ));

           For this table and triggers combination, it is  not  possible  to  use  --preserve-triggers  with  an
           --alter  like  this:  "DROP  COLUMN  f1" since the trigger references the column being dropped and at
           would make the trigger to fail.

           After testing the triggers will work on the new table, the triggers are dropped from  the  new  table
           until all rows have been copied and then they are re-applied.

           --preserve-triggers    cannot    be   used   with   these   other   parameters,   --no-drop-triggers,
           --no-drop-old-table and --no-swap-tables since --preserve-triggers  implies  that  the  old  triggers
           should  be  deleted  and  recreated in the new table.  Since it is not possible to have more than one
           trigger with the same name, old triggers must be deleted in order to be able to  recreate  them  into
           the new table.

           Using  "--preserve-triggers"  with  "--no-swap-tables"  will cause triggers to remain defined for the
           original table.  Please read the documentation for --swap-tables

           If both "--no-swap-tables" and "--no-drop-new-table" is set, the trigger will remain on the  original
           table  and  will  be duplicated on the new table (the trigger will have a random suffix as no trigger
           names are unique).

       --new-table-name
           type: string; default: %T_new

           New table name before it is swapped.  %T is replaced with the original table name.  When the  default
           is used, the tool prefixes the name with up to 10 "_" (underscore) to find a unique table name.  If a
           table name is specified, the tool does not prefix it with "_", so the table must not exist.

       --null-to-not-null
           Allows  MODIFYing  a  column  that  allows NULL values to one that doesn't allow them. The rows which
           contain NULL values will be converted to the defined default value. If no explicit DEFAULT  value  is
           given MySQL will assign a default value based on datatype, e.g. 0 for number datatypes, '' for string
           datatypes.

       --only-same-schema-fks
           Check  foreigns  keys  only  on  tables  on  the same schema than the original table.  This option is
           dangerous since if you have FKs refenrencing tables in other schemas, they won't be detected.

       --password
           short form: -p; type: string

           Password to use when connecting.  If password contains commas they must be escaped with a  backslash:
           "exam\,ple"

       --pause-file
           type: string

           Execution will be paused while the file specified by this param exists.

       --pid
           type: string

           Create  the  given  PID  file.   The  tool  won't start if the PID file already exists and the PID it
           contains is different than the current PID.  However, if the PID file exists and the PID it  contains
           is  no  longer  running,  the tool will overwrite the PID file with the current PID.  The PID file is
           removed automatically when the tool exits.

       --plugin
           type: string

           Perl module file that defines a "pt_online_schema_change_plugin" class.  A plugin allows you to write
           a Perl module that can hook into  many  parts  of  pt-online-schema-change.   This  requires  a  good
           knowledge of Perl and Percona Toolkit conventions, which are beyond this scope of this documentation.
           Please contact Percona if you have questions or need help.

           See "PLUGIN" for more information.

       --port
           short form: -P; type: int

           Port number to use for connection.

       --print
           Print SQL statements to STDOUT.  Specifying this option allows you to see most of the statements that
           the tool executes. You can use this option with "--dry-run", for example.

       --progress
           type: array; default: time,30

           Print  progress  reports  to STDERR while copying rows.  The value is a comma-separated list with two
           parts.  The first part can be percentage, time, or iterations; the second part specifies how often an
           update should be printed, in percentage, seconds, or number of iterations.

       --quiet
           short form: -q

           Do not print messages to STDOUT (disables "--progress").  Errors and warnings are  still  printed  to
           STDERR.

       --recurse
           type: int

           Number  of  levels  to recurse in the hierarchy when discovering replicas.  Default is infinite.  See
           also "--recursion-method".

       --recursion-method
           type: array; default: processlist,hosts

           Preferred recursion method for discovering replicas.  Possible methods are:

             METHOD       USES
             ===========  ==================
             processlist  SHOW PROCESSLIST
             hosts        SHOW SLAVE HOSTS
             dsn=DSN      DSNs from a table
             none         Do not find slaves

           The processlist method is the default, because SHOW SLAVE HOSTS is not reliable.  However, the  hosts
           method  can work better if the server uses a non-standard port (not 3306).  The tool usually does the
           right thing and finds all replicas, but you may give a preferred method and it will be used first.

           The hosts method requires replicas to be configured with report_host, report_port, etc.

           The dsn method is special: it specifies a table from which other DSN strings are read.  The specified
           DSN must specify a D and t, or a database-qualified t.  The  DSN  table  should  have  the  following
           structure:

             CREATE TABLE `dsns` (
               `id` <a href="../man11/int.11.html">int</a>(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
               `parent_id` <a href="../man11/int.11.html">int</a>(11) DEFAULT NULL,
               `dsn` <a href="../man255/varchar.255.html">varchar</a>(255) NOT NULL,
               PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
             );

           To  make  the  tool  monitor only the hosts 10.10.1.16 and 10.10.1.17 for replication lag, insert the
           values "h=10.10.1.16" and "h=10.10.1.17" into the table. Currently, the DSNs are ordered by  id,  but
           id and parent_id are otherwise ignored.

           You can change the list of hosts while OSC is executing: if you change the contents of the DSN table,
           OSC will pick it up very soon.

       --skip-check-slave-lag
           type: DSN; repeatable: yes

           DSN  to skip when checking slave lag. It can be used multiple times.  Example: --skip-check-slave-lag
           h=127.0.0.1,P=12345 --skip-check-slave-lag h=127.0.0.1,P=12346 Please take  into  consideration  that
           even  when  for  the  MySQL  driver  h=127.1  is equal to h=127.0.0.1, for this parameter you need to
           specify the full IP address.

       --slave-user
           type: string

           Sets the user to be used to connect to the slaves.  This parameter allows you  to  have  a  different
           user with less privileges on the slaves but that user must exist on all slaves.

       --slave-password
           type: string

           Sets  the  password  to  be  used to connect to the slaves.  It can be used with --slave-user and the
           password for the user must be the same on all slaves.

       --set-vars
           type: Array

           Set the MySQL variables in this comma-separated list of "variable=value" pairs.

           By default, the tool sets:

              wait_timeout=10000
              innodb_lock_wait_timeout=1
              lock_wait_timeout=60

           Variables specified on the command line override these defaults.  For example, specifying "--set-vars
           wait_timeout=500" overrides the default value of 10000.

           The tool prints a warning and continues if a variable cannot be set.

           Note that setting the "sql_mode" variable requires some tricky escapes to be able to parse the quotes
           and commas.

           Example:

              --set-vars sql_mode=\'STRICT_ALL_TABLES\\,ALLOW_INVALID_DATES\'

           Note the single backslash for the quotes and double backslash for the comma.

       --sleep
           type: float; default: 0

           How long to sleep (in seconds) after copying each chunk. This option is  useful  when  throttling  by
           "--max-lag"  and  "--max-load" are not possible.  A small, sub-second value should be used, like 0.1,
           else the tool could take a very long time to copy large tables.

       --socket
           short form: -S; type: string

           Socket file to use for connection.

       --statistics
           Print statistics about internal counters.  This is useful to see how many  warnings  were  suppressed
           compared to the number of INSERT.

       --[no]swap-tables
           default: yes

           Swap  the  original  table  and the new, altered table.  This step completes the online schema change
           process by making the table with the new schema take the place of the original table.   The  original
           table becomes the "old table," and the tool drops it unless you disable "--[no]drop-old-table".

           Using  "--no-swap-tables"  will run the whole process, it will create the new table, it will copy all
           rows but at the end it will drop the new table. It is intended to run a more realistic --dry-run.

       --tries
           type: array

           How many times to try critical operations.  If certain operations fail due to non-fatal,  recoverable
           errors,  the  tool  waits  and tries the operation again.  These are the operations that are retried,
           with their default number of tries and wait time between tries (in seconds):

              OPERATION            TRIES   WAIT
              ===================  =====   ====
              create_triggers         10      1
              drop_triggers           10      1
              copy_rows               10   0.25
              swap_tables             10      1
              update_foreign_keys     10      1
              analyze_table           10      1

           To change the defaults, specify the new values like:

              --tries create_triggers:5:0.5,drop_triggers:5:0.5

           That makes the tool try "create_triggers" and "drop_triggers" 5 times with a 0.5 second wait  between
           tries.  So the format is:

              operation:tries:wait[,operation:tries:wait]

           All three values must be specified.

           Note  that  most  operations  are  affected  only  in MySQL 5.5 and newer by "lock_wait_timeout" (see
           "--set-vars") because of metadata locks.  The "copy_rows" operation is affected  in  any  version  of
           MySQL by "innodb_lock_wait_timeout".

           For  creating  and  dropping triggers, the number of tries applies to each "CREATE TRIGGER" and "DROP
           TRIGGER" statement for each trigger.  For copying rows, the number of tries applies  to  each  chunk,
           not the entire table.  For swapping tables, the number of tries usually applies once because there is
           usually  only  one  "RENAME  TABLE" statement.  For rebuilding foreign key constraints, the number of
           tries   applies   to   each   statement   ("ALTER"   statements   for    the    "rebuild_constraints"
           "--alter-foreign-keys-method"; other statements for the "drop_swap" method).

           The tool retries each operation if these errors occur:

              Lock wait timeout (innodb_lock_wait_timeout and lock_wait_timeout)
              Deadlock found
              Query is killed (KILL QUERY &lt;thread_id&gt;)
              Connection is killed (KILL CONNECTION &lt;thread_id&gt;)
              Lost connection to MySQL

           In the case of lost and killed connections, the tool will automatically reconnect.

           Failures and retries are recorded in the "--statistics".

       --user
           short form: -u; type: string

           User for login if not current user.

       --version
           Show version and exit.

       --[no]version-check
           default: yes

           Check for the latest version of Percona Toolkit, MySQL, and other programs.

           This  is  a standard "check for updates automatically" feature, with two additional features.  First,
           the tool checks its own version and also the versions of the following  software:  operating  system,
           Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM), MySQL, Perl, MySQL driver for Perl (DBD::mysql), and Percona
           Toolkit.  Second,  it  checks  for  and  warns about versions with known problems. For example, MySQL
           5.5.25 had a critical bug and was re-released as 5.5.25a.

           A secure connection to Percona’s Version Check database server is done to perform these checks.  Each
           request  is  logged  by  the  server, including software version numbers and unique ID of the checked
           system. The ID is generated by the Percona Toolkit installation script  or  when  the  Version  Check
           database call is done for the first time.

           Any  updates  or  known problems are printed to STDOUT before the tool's normal output.  This feature
           should never interfere with the normal operation of the tool.

</pre><h4><b>PLUGIN</b></h4><pre>
       The   file   specified   by   "--plugin"   must   define   a    class    (i.e.    a    package)    called
       "pt_online_schema_change_plugin"  with  a  "new()"  subroutine.  The tool will create an instance of this
       class and call any hooks that it defines.  No hooks are required, but a plugin isn't very useful  without
       them.

       These hooks, in this order, are called if defined:

          init
          before_create_new_table
          after_create_new_table
          before_alter_new_table
          after_alter_new_table
          before_create_triggers
          after_create_triggers
          before_copy_rows
          after_copy_rows
          before_swap_tables
          after_swap_tables
          before_update_foreign_keys
          after_update_foreign_keys
          before_drop_old_table
          after_drop_old_table
          before_drop_triggers
          before_exit
          get_slave_lag

       Each  hook  is  passed  different arguments.  To see which arguments are passed to a hook, search for the
       hook's name in the tool's source code, like:

          # --plugin hook
          if ( $plugin &amp;&amp; $plugin-&gt;can('init') ) {
             $plugin-&gt;init(
                orig_tbl       =&gt; $orig_tbl,
                child_tables   =&gt; $child_tables,
                renamed_cols   =&gt; $renamed_cols,
                slaves         =&gt; $slaves,
                slave_lag_cxns =&gt; $slave_lag_cxns,
             );
          }

       The comment "# --plugin hook" precedes every hook call.

       Here's a plugin file template for all hooks:

          package pt_online_schema_change_plugin;

          use strict;

          sub new {
             my ($class, %args) = @_;
             my $self = { %args };
             return bless $self, $class;
          }

          sub init {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN init\n";
          }

          sub before_create_new_table {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN before_create_new_table\n";
          }

          sub after_create_new_table {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN after_create_new_table\n";
          }

          sub before_alter_new_table {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN before_alter_new_table\n";
          }

          sub after_alter_new_table {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN after_alter_new_table\n";
          }

          sub before_create_triggers {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN before_create_triggers\n";
          }

         sub after_create_triggers {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN after_create_triggers\n";
          }

          sub before_copy_rows {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN before_copy_rows\n";
          }

          sub after_copy_rows {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN after_copy_rows\n";
          }

          sub before_swap_tables {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN before_swap_tables\n";
          }

          sub after_swap_tables {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN after_swap_tables\n";
          }

          sub before_update_foreign_keys {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN before_update_foreign_keys\n";
          }

          sub after_update_foreign_keys {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN after_update_foreign_keys\n";
          }

          sub before_drop_old_table {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN before_drop_old_table\n";
          }

          sub after_drop_old_table {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN after_drop_old_table\n";
          }

          sub before_drop_triggers {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN before_drop_triggers\n";
          }

          sub before_exit {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN before_exit\n";
          }

          sub get_slave_lag {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             print "PLUGIN get_slave_lag\n";

             return sub { return 0; };
          }

          1;

       Notice that "get_slave_lag" must return a function reference; ideally one that returns actual slave  lag,
       not simply zero like in the example.

       Here's an example that actually does something:

          package pt_online_schema_change_plugin;

          use strict;

          sub new {
             my ($class, %args) = @_;
             my $self = { %args };
             return bless $self, $class;
          }

          sub after_create_new_table {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             my $new_tbl = $args{new_tbl};
             my $dbh     = $self-&gt;{cxn}-&gt;dbh;
             my $row = $dbh-&gt;selectrow_arrayref("SHOW CREATE TABLE $new_tbl-&gt;{name}");
             warn "after_create_new_table: $row-&gt;[1]\n\n";
          }

          sub after_alter_new_table {
             my ($self, %args) = @_;
             my $new_tbl = $args{new_tbl};
             my $dbh     = $self-&gt;{cxn}-&gt;dbh;
             my $row = $dbh-&gt;selectrow_arrayref("SHOW CREATE TABLE $new_tbl-&gt;{name}");
             warn "after_alter_new_table: $row-&gt;[1]\n\n";
          }

          1;

       You could use this with "--dry-run" to check how the table will look before and after.

       Please contact Percona if you have questions or need help.

</pre><h4><b>DSN</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These  DSN  options are used to create a DSN.  Each option is given like "option=value".  The options are
       case-sensitive, so P and p are not the same option.  There cannot be whitespace before or after  the  "="
       and  if  the  value  contains  whitespace  it  must be quoted.  DSN options are comma-separated.  See the
       percona-toolkit manpage for full details.

       •   A

           dsn: charset; copy: yes

           Default character set.

       •   D

           dsn: database; copy: no

           Database for the old and new table.

       •   F

           dsn: mysql_read_default_file; copy: yes

           Only read default options from the given file

       •   h

           dsn: host; copy: yes

           Connect to host.

       •   p

           dsn: password; copy: yes

           Password to use when connecting.  If password contains commas they must be escaped with a  backslash:
           "exam\,ple"

       •   P

           dsn: port; copy: no

           Port number to use for connection.

       •   S

           dsn: mysql_socket; copy: yes

           Socket file to use for connection.

       •   t

           dsn: table; copy: no

           Table to alter.

       •   u

           dsn: user; copy: yes

           User for login if not current user.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  environment  variable "PTDEBUG" enables verbose debugging output to STDERR.  To enable debugging and
       capture all output to a file, run the tool like:

          PTDEBUG=1 pt-online-schema-change ... &gt; FILE 2&gt;&amp;1

       Be careful: debugging output is voluminous and can generate several megabytes of output.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       You need Perl, DBI, DBD::mysql, and some core packages that ought to be installed in any  reasonably  new
       version of Perl.

       This tool works only on MySQL 5.0.2 and newer versions, because earlier versions do not support triggers.
       Also  a number of permissions should be set on MySQL to make pt-online-schema-change operate as expected.
       PROCESS, SUPER, REPLICATION SLAVE global privileges, as well as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE,  DELETE,  CREATE,
       DROP, ALTER, and TRIGGER table privileges should be granted on server. Slave needs only REPLICATION SLAVE
       and REPLICATION CLIENT privileges.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       For a list of known bugs, see &lt;<a href="http://www.percona.com/bugs/pt-online-schema-change">http://www.percona.com/bugs/pt-online-schema-change</a>&gt;.

       Please report bugs at &lt;https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-toolkit&gt;.  Include the following information in
       your bug report:

       •   Tool "--version"

       •   MySQL version of all servers involved

       •   Output from the tool including STDERR

       •   Input files (log/dump/config files, etc.)

       If possible, include debugging output by running the tool with "PTDEBUG"; see "ENVIRONMENT".

       The  "online  schema  change"  concept  was   first   implemented   by   Shlomi   Noach   in   his   tool
       "oak-online-alter-table",  part  of  &lt;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/openarkkit/">http://code.google.com/p/openarkkit/</a>&gt;.   Engineers at Facebook then
       built  another   version   called   "OnlineSchemaChange.php"   as   explained   by   their   blog   post:
       &lt;<a href="http://tinyurl.com/32zeb86">http://tinyurl.com/32zeb86</a>&gt;.  This  tool  is  a  hybrid of both approaches, with additional features and
