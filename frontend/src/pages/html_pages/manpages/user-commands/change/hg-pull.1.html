</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hg pull - pull changes from the specified source

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       hg pull [-u] [-f] [-r REV]... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [SOURCE]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pull changes from a remote repository to a local one.

       This  finds  all  changes  from  the  repository  at  the  specified path or URL and adds them to a local
       repository (the current one unless -R is specified). By default, this does not update  the  copy  of  the
       project in the working directory.

       When  cloning  from  servers  that support it, Mercurial may fetch pre-generated data. When this is done,
       hooks operating on incoming  changesets  and  changegroups  may  fire  more  than  once,  once  for  each
       pre-generated  bundle  and  as well as for any additional remaining data. See <b>hg</b> <b>help</b> <b>-e</b> <b>clonebundles</b> for
       more.

       Use <b>hg</b> <b>incoming</b> if you want to see what would have been added by a pull  at  the  time  you  issued  this
       command.  If  you then decide to add those changes to the repository, you should use <b>hg</b> <b>pull</b> <b>-r</b> <b>X</b> where <b>X</b>
       is the last changeset listed by <b>hg</b> <b>incoming</b>.

       If SOURCE is omitted, the 'default' path will be used.  See <b>hg</b> <b>help</b> <b>urls</b> for more information.

       If multiple sources are specified, they will be pulled sequentially as if the command  was  run  multiple
       time. If --update is specify and the command will stop at the first failed --update.

       Specifying bookmark as <b>.</b> is equivalent to specifying the active bookmark's name.

       One can use the <u>--remote-hidden</u> flag to pull changesets hidden on the remote. This flag is "best effort",
       and  will  only  work  if  the  server supports the feature and is configured to allow the user to access
       hidden changesets. This option is experimental and backwards compatibility is not garanteed.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if an update had unresolved files.
