</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PDL::Delta - PDL changes between V1.0 and V2.0

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This file is an attempt to list the major user-visible changes between PDL versions 1.0 and 2.0.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ndarrays</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>hashes</b> <b>any</b> <b>more:</b>
           $x = zeroes 10,10;
           $$x{FOO} = "bar"

       doesn't work. They are currently scalar references (to opaque C structures in finer terms) because of
       speed as well as syntactic issues. If you want to have a hash, use

           $x-&gt;hdr()

       which returns a reference to an anonymous hash. Also, subclassing works if you store an ndarray in the
       hash member ``PDL''.

       There are also many core enhancements to support Dataflow and Slicing tricks, but these do not introduce
       any incompatibilities.

   <b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b> <b>vs</b> <b>1.11</b>
       rgrep
           Order of the arguments has changed.

       copy method
           No longer copies the header. This may not be a misfeature.

</pre><h4><b>Documentation</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       Many of the base and library pods were updated.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>Changes</u> file for exhaustive details on what changed.

       The <u>INSTALL</u> file for how to build PDL.

       The <u>README</u> file for general stuff.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       pdldelta was inspired by <u>perldelta</u>  man page in the Perl 5.004 distribution.
