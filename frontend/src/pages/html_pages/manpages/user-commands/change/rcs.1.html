       rcs - change RCS file attributes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rcs</b> <u>options</u> <u>file</u> ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rcs</b>  creates  new  RCS  files  or  changes  attributes  of  existing ones.  An RCS file contains multiple
       revisions of text, an access list, a change log, descriptive text, and some control attributes.  For  <b>rcs</b>
       to  work,  the  caller's  login  name must be on the access list, except if the access list is empty, the
       caller is the owner of the file or the superuser, or the <b>-i</b> option is present.

       Filenames matching an RCS suffix denote RCS files; all others denote working files.  Names are paired  as
       explained in <b><a href="../man1/ci.1.html">ci</a></b>(1).  Revision numbers use the syntax described in <b><a href="../man1/ci.1.html">ci</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-i</b>     Create  and  initialize a new RCS file, but do not deposit any revision.  If the RCS file name has
              no directory component, try to place it first into the  subdirectory  <b>./RCS</b>,  and  then  into  the
              current directory.  If the RCS file already exists, print an error message.

       <b>-a</b><u>logins</u>
              Append  the login names appearing in the comma-separated list <u>logins</u> to the access list of the RCS
              file.

       <b>-A</b><u>oldfile</u>
              Append the access list of <u>oldfile</u> to the access list of the RCS file.

       <b>-e</b>[<u>logins</u>]
              Erase the login names appearing in the comma-separated list <u>logins</u> from the access list of the RCS
              file.  If <u>logins</u> is omitted, erase the entire access list.

       <b>-b</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              Set the default branch  to  <u>rev</u>.   If  <u>rev</u>  is  omitted,  the  default  branch  is  reset  to  the
              (dynamically) highest branch on the trunk.

       <b>-c</b><u>string</u>
              Set  the  comment  leader  to <u>string</u>.  An initial <b>ci</b>, or an <b>rcs</b> <b>-i</b> without <b>-c</b>, guesses the comment
              leader from the suffix of the working file name.

              This option is obsolescent, since RCS  normally  uses  the  preceding  <b>$Log$</b>  line's  prefix  when
              inserting  log  lines during checkout (see <b><a href="../man1/co.1.html">co</a></b>(1)).  However, older versions of RCS use the comment
              leader instead of the <b>$Log$</b> line's prefix, so if you plan to access a file with both old  and  new
              versions of RCS, make sure its comment leader matches its <b>$Log$</b> line prefix.

       <b>-k</b><u>subst</u>
              Set the default keyword substitution to <u>subst</u>.  The effect of keyword substitution is described in
              <b><a href="../man1/co.1.html">co</a></b>(1).   Giving an explicit <b>-k</b> option to <b>co</b>, <b>rcsdiff</b>, and <b>rcsmerge</b> overrides this default.  Beware
              <b>rcs</b> <b>-kv</b>, because <b>-kv</b> is incompatible with <b>co</b> <b>-l</b>.  Use  <b>rcs</b> <b>-kkv</b>  to  restore  the  normal  default
              keyword substitution.

       <b>-l</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              Lock the revision with number <u>rev</u>.  If a branch is given, lock the latest revision on that branch.
              If  <u>rev</u>  is omitted, lock the latest revision on the default branch.  Locking prevents overlapping
              changes.  If someone else already holds the lock, the lock is broken as with <b>rcs</b> <b>-u</b> (see below).

       <b>-u</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              Unlock the revision with number <u>rev</u>.  If a branch is given, unlock the  latest  revision  on  that
              branch.   If <u>rev</u> is omitted, remove the latest lock held by the caller.  Normally, only the locker
              of a revision can unlock it.  Somebody else unlocking a revision breaks  the  lock.   If  RCS  was
              configured  <b>--with-mailer</b>, then this causes a mail message to be sent to the original locker.  The
              message contains a commentary solicited from the breaker.  The commentary is terminated by end-of-
              file or by a line containing <b>.</b> by itself.

       <b>-L</b>     Set locking to <u>strict</u>.  Strict locking means that the owner of an RCS  file  is  not  exempt  from
              locking for checkin.  This option should be used for files that are shared.

       <b>-U</b>     Set  locking  to  non-strict.   Non-strict  locking means that the owner of a file need not lock a
              revision for checkin.  This option should <u>not</u> be used for files that are shared.  Whether  default
              locking is strict is determined by your system administrator, but it is normally strict.

       <b>-m</b><u>rev</u><b>:</b>[<u>msg</u>]
              Replace  revision  <u>rev</u>'s  log  message with <u>msg</u>.  If <u>msg</u> is omitted, it defaults to "*** empty log
              message ***".

       <b>-M</b>     Do not send mail when breaking somebody else's lock.  This option is not meant for casual use;  it
              is  meant for programs that warn users by other means, and invoke <b>rcs</b> <b>-u</b> only as a low-level lock-
              breaking operation.

       <b>-n</b><u>name</u>[<b>:</b>[<u>rev</u>]]
              Associate the symbolic name <u>name</u> with the branch or revision <u>rev</u>.  Delete  the  symbolic  name  if
              both  <b>:</b>  and <u>rev</u> are omitted; otherwise, print an error message if <u>name</u> is already associated with
              another number.  If <u>rev</u> is symbolic, it is expanded before association.  A  <u>rev</u>  consisting  of  a
              branch  number  followed by a <b>.</b> stands for the current latest revision in the branch.  A <b>:</b> with an
              empty <u>rev</u> stands for the current latest revision on the default branch, normally the  trunk.   For
              example,  <b>rcs</b> <b>-n</b><u>name</u><b>:</b> <b>RCS/*</b>  associates <u>name</u> with the current latest revision of all the named RCS
              files; this contrasts with <b>rcs</b> <b>-n</b><u>name</u><b>:$</b> <b>RCS/*</b> which associates  <u>name</u>  with  the  revision  numbers
              extracted from keyword strings in the corresponding working files.

       <b>-N</b><u>name</u>[<b>:</b>[<u>rev</u>]]
              Act like <b>-n</b>, except override any previous assignment of <u>name</u>.

       <b>-o</b><u>range</u>
              deletes (“outdates”) the revisions given by <u>range</u>.  A range consisting of a single revision number
              means  that  revision.   A  range  consisting of a branch number means the latest revision on that
              branch.  A range of the form <u>rev1</u><b>:</b><u>rev2</u> means revisions <u>rev1</u> to <u>rev2</u> on the same branch, <b>:</b><u>rev</u> means
              from the beginning of the branch containing <u>rev</u> up to and  including  <u>rev</u>,  and  <u>rev</u><b>:</b>  means  from
              revision  <u>rev</u>  to  the  end of the branch containing <u>rev</u>.  None of the outdated revisions can have
              branches or locks.

       <b>-q</b>     Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.

       <b>-I</b>     Run interactively, even if the standard input is not a terminal.

       <b>-s</b><u>state</u>[<b>:</b><u>rev</u>]
              Set the state attribute of the revision <u>rev</u> to <u>state</u>.  If <u>rev</u>  is  a  branch  number,  assume  the
              latest  revision  on  that  branch.   If <u>rev</u> is omitted, assume the latest revision on the default
              branch.   Any  identifier  is  acceptable  for  <u>state</u>.   A  useful  set  of  states  is  <b>Exp</b>  (for
              experimental),  <b>Stab</b>  (for stable), and <b>Rel</b> (for released).  By default, <b><a href="../man1/ci.1.html">ci</a></b>(1) sets the state of a
              revision to <b>Exp</b>.

       <b>-t</b>[<u>file</u>]
              Write descriptive text from the contents of the  named  <u>file</u>  into  the  RCS  file,  deleting  the
              existing  text.   The  <u>file</u>  name  cannot  begin with <b>-</b>.  If <u>file</u> is omitted, obtain the text from
              standard input, terminated by end-of-file or by a line containing <b>.</b> by  itself.   Prompt  for  the
              text  if interaction is possible; see <b>-I</b>.  With <b>-i</b>, descriptive text is obtained even if <b>-t</b> is not
              given.

       <b>-t-</b><u>string</u>
              Write descriptive text from the <u>string</u> into the RCS file, deleting the existing text.

       <b>-T</b>     Preserve the modification time on the RCS file unless a revision  is  removed.   This  option  can
              suppress  extensive  recompilation caused by a <b><a href="../man1/make.1.html">make</a></b>(1) dependency of some copy of the working file
              on the RCS file.  Use this option with care; it can suppress recompilation even when it is needed,
              i.e. when a change to the RCS file would mean a change to keyword strings in the working file.

       <b>-V</b>     Print RCS's version number.

       <b>-V</b><u>n</u>    Emulate RCS version <u>n</u>.  See <b><a href="../man1/co.1.html">co</a></b>(1) for details.

       <b>-x</b><u>suffixes</u>
              Use <u>suffixes</u> to characterize RCS files.  See <b><a href="../man1/ci.1.html">ci</a></b>(1) for details.

       <b>-z</b><u>zone</u> Use <u>zone</u> as the default time zone.  This option has no effect; it  is  present  for  compatibility
              with other RCS commands.

       At least one explicit option must be given, to ensure compatibility with future planned extensions to the
       <b>rcs</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-b</b><u>rev</u> option generates an RCS file that cannot be parsed by RCS version 3 or earlier.

       The <b>-k</b><u>subst</u> options (except <b>-kkv</b>) generate an RCS file that cannot be parsed by RCS version 4 or earlier.

       Use  <b>rcs</b> <b>-V</b><u>n</u> to make an RCS file acceptable to RCS version <u>n</u> by discarding information that would confuse
       version <u>n</u>.

       RCS version 5.5 and earlier does not support the <b>-x</b> option, and requires a <b>,v</b> suffix on an RCS file name.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rcs</b> accesses files much as <b><a href="../man1/ci.1.html">ci</a></b>(1) does, except that it uses the effective user for all accesses,  it  does
       not write the working file or its directory, and it does not even read the working file unless a revision
       number of <b>$</b> is specified.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>RCSINIT</b>
              Options prepended to the argument list, separated by spaces.  A backslash escapes spaces within an
              option.   The  <b>RCSINIT</b>  options  are prepended to the argument lists of most RCS commands.  Useful
              <b>RCSINIT</b> options include <b>-q</b>, <b>-V</b>, <b>-x</b>, and <b>-z</b>.

       <b>RCS_MEM_LIMIT</b>
              Normally, for speed, commands either memory map or copy into memory the RCS file if  its  size  is
              less  than  the  <u>memory-limit</u>,  currently  defaulting  to  ``unlimited''.   Otherwise  (or  if the
              initially-tried speedy ways fail), the commands fall back to using standard i/o routines.  You can
              adjust the memory limit by setting <b>RCS_MEM_LIMIT</b> to a numeric value <u>lim</u> (measured  in  kilobytes).
              An empty value is silently ignored.  As a side effect, specifying <b>RCS_MEM_LIMIT</b> inhibits fall-back
              to slower routines.

       <b>TMPDIR</b> Name of the temporary directory.  If not set, the environment variables <b>TMP</b> and <b>TEMP</b> are inspected
              instead  and  the first value found is taken; if none of them are set, a host-dependent default is
              used, typically <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b>.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The RCS file name and the revisions outdated are written to the diagnostic output.  The  exit  status  is
       zero if and only if all operations were successful.

       The full documentation for RCS is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the <b><a href="../man1/info.1.html">info</a></b>(1) and  RCS  programs  are
       properly installed at your site, the command

              <b>info</b> <b>rcs</b>

       should give you access to the complete manual.  Additionally, the RCS homepage:

              <b><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/">http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/</a></b>

       has news and links to the latest release, development site, etc.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       A  catastrophe  (e.g.  a  system  crash) can cause RCS to leave behind a semaphore file that causes later
       invocations of RCS to claim that the RCS file is in use.  To fix this,  remove  the  semaphore  file.   A
       semaphore file's name typically begins with <b>,</b> or ends with <b>_</b>.

       The separator for revision ranges in the <b>-o</b> option used to be <b>-</b> instead of <b>:</b>, but this leads to confusion
       when  symbolic  names  contain <b>-</b>.  For backwards compatibility <b>rcs</b> <b>-o</b> still supports the old <b>-</b> separator,
       but it warns about this obsolete use.

       Symbolic names need not refer to existing revisions or branches.  For example, the  <b>-o</b>  option  does  not
       remove symbolic names for the outdated revisions; you must use <b>-n</b> to remove the names.
