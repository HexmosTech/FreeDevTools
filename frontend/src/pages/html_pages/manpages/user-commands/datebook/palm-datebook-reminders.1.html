</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       palm-datebook-reminders - generate simple report from Palm Datebook DB

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>PALM-DATEBOOK-REMINDERS</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>palm-datebook-reminders</b> reads a Palm Datebook database and prints out a list of events in the near future
       in a reasonably easy to read format.

       Immiment  events (ones in approximately the next 48 hours by default) are listed with complete item text.
       Forthcoming events (approximately the next 4 weeks by default) are listed in summary form.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>imminent</u><b>/</b><u>forthcoming</u> | <b>-t</b>imminent<b>/</b>forthcoming
              Specifies that imminent and forthcoming events are ones within the next <u>immiment</u>  and  <u>forthcoming</u>
              seconds, respectively.

       <u>filename</u> | <b>-f</b><u>filename</u>
              Reads  the  file  <u>filename</u>  instead  of <b>./DatebookDB.pdb</b>.  If the bare form is used, <u>filename</u> must
              start with a <b>.</b>  or <b>/</b> (dot or slash).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The program is not configurable enough.

       The option parsing is very grotty.

       Proper character set conversion is not performed.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DatebookDB.pdb</b>
              Default input file.
