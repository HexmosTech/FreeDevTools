</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hg push - push changes to the specified destination

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       hg push [-f] [-r REV]... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [DEST]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Push changesets from the local repository to the specified destination.

       This  operation  is symmetrical to pull: it is identical to a pull in the destination repository from the
       current one.

       By default, push will not allow creation of new heads at the destination, since multiple heads would make
       it unclear which head to use. In this situation, it is recommended to pull and merge before pushing.

       Use --new-branch if you want to allow push to create a new named  branch  that  is  not  present  at  the
       destination. This allows you to only create a new branch without forcing other changes.

       Note   Extra  care  should  be  taken  with  the  -f/--force option, which will push all new heads on all
              branches, an action which will almost always cause confusion for collaborators.

       If -r/--rev is used, the specified  revision  and  all  its  ancestors  will  be  pushed  to  the  remote
       repository.

       If  -B/--bookmark  is  used,  the  specified bookmarked revision, its ancestors, and the bookmark will be
       pushed to the remote repository. Specifying <b>.</b> is equivalent to specifying the active bookmark's name. Use
       the --all-bookmarks option for pushing all current bookmarks.

       Please see <b>hg</b> <b>help</b> <b>urls</b> for important details about <b>ssh://</b> URLs. If DESTINATION  is  omitted,  a  default
       path will be used.

       When  passed  multiple destinations, push will process them one after the other, but stop should an error
       occur.

       The --pushvars option sends strings to the  server  that  become  environment  variables  prepended  with
       <b>HG_USERVAR_</b>.   For   example,  <b>--pushvars</b>  <b>ENABLE_FEATURE=true</b>,  provides  the  server  side  hooks  with
       <b>HG_USERVAR_ENABLE_FEATURE=true</b> as part of their environment.

       pushvars can provide for user-overridable hooks as well as set debug levels. One example is having a hook
       that blocks commits containing conflict markers, but enables the user to override the hook if the file is
       using conflict markers for testing purposes or the file  format  has  strings  that  look  like  conflict
       markers.

       By default, servers will ignore <u>--pushvars</u>. To enable it add the following to your configuration file:

       [push]
       pushvars.server = true

       Returns 0 if push was successful, 1 if nothing to push.
