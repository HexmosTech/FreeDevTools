</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page is a quick reference for the Makefile Generator of the TTCN-3  Test  Executor.  It  only
       summarizes  the  meaning  of  all  command line options. For more details please consult the <b>Programmer's</b>
       <b>Technical</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>for</b> <b>TITAN</b> <b>TTCN-3</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Executor.</b>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are supported (in alphabetical order):

       <b>-a</b>        Refer to files using <u>absolute</u> path names in the generated Makefile.  By  default  the  Makefile
                 uses  relative  path names to access files located outside the current working directory of the
                 compiler. Files from the current working directory are always referenced using  only  the  file
                 name without any directory.

       <b>-c</b>        Generate  a  Makefile  that  is capable of using pre-compiled C++ and object files from <u>central</u>
                 directories in order to save disk space and compilation time.

       <b>-d</b>        <u>Dump</u> the internal data structures used for Makefile generation. This option  is  mainly  useful
                 for debugging.

       <b>-e</b> <u>ETS_name</u>
                 Sets  the name of the target binary program (i.e. the executable test suite) to <u>ETS_name</u> in the
                 generated Makefile. If this option is omitted, the name of the first TTCN-3 module will be used
                 as default.

       <b>-E</b>        Instructs  the  variant  attribute  parser  to  display  warnings   instead   of   errors   for
                 unrecognized/erroneous attributes.

       <b>-f</b>        Forces  the  Makefile  Generator  to  <u>overwrite</u>  the  output  files  even  if they exist or are
                 unchanged.

       <b>-g</b>        Generates a Makefile that can be used with <u>GNU</u>  <u>make</u>  only.  The  resulting  Makefile  will  be
                 smaller  and  less  redundant. It exploits the pattern substitution features of GNU make, which
                 may cause syntax errors with other versions of make.

       <b>-h</b>        Allows unsafe universal charstring to charstring conversion.

       <b>-i</b>        Enables real-time testing features.

       <b>-I</b> <u>path</u>   Adds the path to the list of search paths.  <u>path</u> must be an absolute path.  Used  with  the  <b>-t</b>
                 option  when  the  referenced  projects can not be found at the projectRelativeURI location. In
                 that case the tool will try to find the referenced TPD file using the search paths.  The  first
                 TPD file found is taken. If the tpdName attribute is present in
                  ReferencedProject  then the value of tpdName will be used as a TPD name during search. However
                 if the tpdName attribute is missing then the value of the name attribute is taken with the .tpd
                 suffix and used during the search.

       <b>-k</b>        Enables object-oriented features.

       <b>-o</b> <u>dir|file</u>
                 Write the Makefile to the given directory or  file.   The  current  working  directory  is  the
                 default otherwise.  If the given argument is an existing directory, the generated <u>Makefile</u> will
                 be  placed  into  that directory. Otherwise the given argument is assumed to be the name of the
                 generated <u>Makefile.</u>

       <b>-O</b> <u>file</u>   Add <u>file</u> to the list of <u>other</u> <u>files</u> in the generated  Makefile  without  analyzing  the  file's
                 contents  and suffix.  This option can be used to temporarily exclude some TTCN-3, ASN.1 or C++
                 files from the build process, but add them to the archive created by the command <u>make</u> <u>archive.</u>

       <b>-l</b>        Enable dynamic linking. All files of the project will be  compiled  with  <u>-fPIC</u>  and  for  each
                 (static) object, a new shared object will be created. Then, these shared objects will be linked
                 to the final executable instead of the (static) objects. It can be used to speed up the linking
                 phase,  in the price of somewhat lower performance and increased memory usage. It's recommended
                 to use this flag only in the development phase of the project. This option is not supported  on
                 Windows.

       <b>-M</b>        Allows  the  use  of  the  value <b>omit</b> in template lists and complemented template lists (legacy
                 behavior).  If set, an omitted field will match a template list, if the value <b>omit</b>  appears  in
                 the  list,  and  it  will  match  a complemented template list, if <b>omit</b> is not in the list (the
                 <b>ifpresent</b> attribute can still be used for matching  omitted  fields).  This  also  affects  the
                 <b>ispresent</b> operation and the <b>present</b> template restriction accordingly.

       <b>-n</b>        Activates the debugger and generates extra code for storing debug information.

       <b>-p</b>        Generate  Makefile  with  <u>TTCN-3</u>  <u>preprocessing.</u>   All  the TTCN-3 source files with the <u>ttcnpp</u>
                 extension will be preprocessed using the C preprocessor.

       <b>-R</b>        Use function test runtime (TITAN_RUNTIME_2). Generates a Makefile that compiles and  links  the
                 source code using the function test runtime.

       <b>-s</b>        Generates a Makefile, which links the executable test suite with the <u>single</u> <u>mode</u> version of the
                 base library. If this switch is omitted the executable is built for parallel mode by default.

       <b>-S</b>        Suppresses all <u>makefilegen</u> warning messages.

       <b>-v</b>        Prints <u>version</u> and license key information and exits.

       <b>-w</b>        Suppresses all <u>warning</u> messages gerenated by TITAN.

       <b>-z</b> <u>file</u>   Enables code coverage and profiling in the TTCN-3 files listed in the <u>file</u> argument. The TTCN-3
                 files  in  the  list  must  be  separated  by new lines and must also appear among the makefile
                 generator's arguments (this switch is ignored if the <b>-t</b> option is present).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       TTCN3_DIR
              The installation directory where the uncompressed binary package of TTCN-3 Test  Executor  can  be
              found.

       TTCN3_LICENSE_FILE
              It  shall  point to the <u>file</u> (<b>NB:</b> <u>not</u> to its directory) that contains the personalized license key
              for the current user or host.
