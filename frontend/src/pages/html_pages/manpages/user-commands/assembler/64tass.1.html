</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       64tass - A multi pass optimizing macro assembler for the 65xx series of processors

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>64tass</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>SOURCES</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       64tass  is  cross assembler targeting the 65xx series of micro processors. This manual is only describing
       the command line options. The many features are described in the HTML manual.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Output</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-o</b> <u>filename</u>, <b>--output</b> <u>filename</u>
            Place output into <u>filename</u>. The default output filename is 'a.out', this option changes it.  May  be
            used  multiple  times.  The  format  is remembered but section and memory map file reverts to global
            after each file.

       <b>--output-append</b> <u>filename</u>
            Append to output file instead of overwriting it.

       <b>--no-output</b>
            Same as output but no file will be written.

       <b>--map</b> <u>filename</u>
            Place memory map into <u>filename</u> instead of displaying it.

       <b>--map-append</b> <u>filename</u>
            Append memory map to a file instead of displaying it.

       <b>--no-map</b>
            The memory map won't be displayed or recorded.

       <b>--output-section</b> <u>sectionname</u>
            Output this section instead of everything

       <b>--output-exec</b> <u>expression</u>
            Sets execution address for output formats which support this.

       <b>-X</b>, <b>--long-address</b>
            Use 3 byte address/length for CBM and nonlinear output instead of 2 bytes. Also increases  the  size
            of raw output to 16 MiB.

       <b>--cbm-prg</b>
            Generate  CBM  format  binaries  (default).   The first 2 bytes are the little endian address of the
            first valid byte (start address). Overlapping blocks  are  flattened  and  uninitialized  memory  is
            filled  up  with zeros. Uninitialized memory before the first and after the last valid bytes are not
            saved. Up to 64 KiB or 16 MiB with long address.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--nostart</b>
            Output raw data only without start address.  Overlapping  blocks  are  flattened  and  uninitialized
            memory is filled up with zeros. Uninitialized memory before the first and after the last valid bytes
            are not saved. Up to 64 KiB or 16 MiB with long address.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--flat</b>
            Flat address space output mode.  Overlapping blocks are flattened and uninitialized memory is filled
            up with zeros. Uninitialized memory after the last valid byte is not saved.  Up to 4 GiB.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--nonlinear</b>
            Generate  nonlinear output file.  Overlapping blocks are flattened. Blocks are saved in sorted order
            and uninitialized memory is skipped. Up to 64 KiB or 16 MiB with long address.

       <b>--atari-xex</b>
            Generate a Atari XEX output file.  Overlapping blocks are kept, continuing blocks are  concatenated.
            Saving  happens  in the definition order without sorting, and uninitialized memory is skipped in the
            output. Up to 64 KiB.

       <b>--apple2</b>
            Generate a Apple II output file (DOS 3.3).   Overlapping  blocks  are  flattened  and  uninitialized
            memory is filled up with zeros. Uninitialized memory before the first and after the last valid bytes
            are not saved. Up to 64 KiB.  <b>--c256-pgx</b> Generate a C256 Foenix PGX output file.  Overlapping blocks
            are  flattened  and  uninitialized  memory  is filled up with zeros. Uninitialized memory before the
            first and after the last valid bytes are not saved. Up to 16 MiB.

       <b>--c256-pgz</b>
            Generate a C256 Foenix PGZ output file.  Overlapping blocks  are  flattened.  Blocks  are  saved  in
            sorted order and uninitialized memory is skipped. Up to 16 MiB.

       <b>--intel-hex</b>
            Use  Intel  HEX  output  file format.  Overlapping blocks are kept, data is stored in the definition
            order, and uninitialized areas are skipped. I8HEX up to 64 KiB, I32HEX up to 4 GiB.

       <b>--s-record</b>
            Use Motorola S-record output file format.  Overlapping blocks  are  kept,  data  is  stored  in  the
            definition order, and uninitialized memory areas are skipped. S19 up to 64 KiB, S28 up to 16 MiB and
            S37 up to 4 GiB.

   <b>Operation</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-a</b>, <b>--ascii</b>
            Use  ASCII/Unicode  text encoding instead of raw 8-bit.  Normally no conversion takes place, this is
            for backwards compatibility with a DOS based Turbo Assembler  editor,  which  could  create  PETSCII
            files  for  6502tass.  (including  control  characters  of course) Using this option will change the
            default 'none' and 'screen' encodings to map 'a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z' into the correct PETSCII  range  of
            $41-$5A  and  $C1-$DA,  which  is  more suitable for an ASCII editor. It also adds predefined petcat
            style PETSCII literals to the default encodings, and enables Unicode letters in symbol  names.   For
            writing sources in UTF-8/UTF-16 encodings this option is required!

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--long-branch</b>
            Automatic  BXX *+5 JMP xxx. Branch too long messages can be annoying sometimes, usually they'll need
            to be rewritten to BXX *+5 JMP xxx. 64tass can do this automatically if this option is used. But BRA
            is not converted.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--case-sensitive</b>
            Make all symbols  (variables,  opcodes,  directives,  operators,  etc.)  case  sensitive.  Otherwise
            everything is case insensitive by default.

       <b>-D</b> <u>label</u>=<u>value</u>
            Defines  a  <u>label</u>  to  a  <u>value</u>.  Same  syntax is allowed as in source files. Be careful with string
            quoting, the shell might eat some of the characters.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
            Suppress messages. Disables header and summary messages.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--tasm-compatible</b>
            Enable TASM compatible operators and precedence Switches the expression evaluator into compatibility
            mode. This enables '.', ':' and '!' operators and  disables  64tass  specific  extensions,  disables
            precedence  handling  and  forces  16  bit  unsigned  evaluation (see 'differences to original Turbo
            Assembler' below)

       <b>-I</b> <u>path</u>
            Specify include search <u>path</u>.  If an included source or binary file can't be found in  the  directory
            of  the source file then this path is tried. More than one directories can be specified by repeating
            this option. If multiple matches exist the first one is used.

       <b>-M</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--dependencies</b> <u>file</u>
            Specify make rule output <u>file</u>.  Writes a dependency rule suitable for 'make' from the list of  files
            used during compilation.

       <b>--dependencies-append</b> <u>file</u>
            Append to dependencies file instead of overwriting it.

       <b>--make-phony</b>
            Enable phony target generation for dependencies.

   <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-E</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--error</b> <u>file</u>
            Specify error output <u>file</u>.  Normally compilation errors a written to the standard error output. It's
            possible to redirect them to a file or to the standard output by using '-' as the file name.

       <b>--error-append</b> <u>file</u>
            Append to error file instead of overwriting it.

       <b>--no-error</b>
            Do not output any errors, just count them.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--no-warn</b>
            Suppress  warnings.  Disables warnings during compile. Finer grained warning control is available by
            using the -W options.

       <b>--no-caret-diag</b>
            Suppress displaying of faulty source line and fault position after fault messages.

       <b>--macro-caret-diag</b>
            Restrict source line and fault position display to macro expansions only.

       <b>-Wall</b>
            Enable most diagnostic warnings, except those  individually  disabled.  Or  with  the  'no-'  prefix
            disable all except those enabled.

       <b>-Werror</b>
            Make all diagnostic warnings to an error, except those individually set to a warning.

       <b>-Werror</b>=<u>&lt;name&gt;</u>
            Change  a  diagnostic  warning  to  an error.  For example '-Werror=implied-reg' makes this check an
            error. The '-Wno-error=' variant is useful with '-Werror' to set some to warnings.

       <b>-Walias</b>
            Warns about alias opcodes.

       <b>-Walign</b>
            Warns whenever padding bytes were added for an alignment.

       <b>-Waltmode</b>
            Warn about alternative address modes.  Sometimes  alternative  addressing  modes  are  used  as  the
            fitting  one  is  not  available. For example there's no lda direct page y so instead data bank y is
            used with a warning.

       <b>-Wbranch-page</b>
            Warns if a branch is crossing a page.  Page crossing branches execute with  a  penalty  cycle.  This
            option helps to locate them.

       <b>-Wcase-symbol</b>
            Warn if symbol letter case is used inconsistently.

       <b>-Wimmediate</b>
            Warns  for  cases  where  immediate  addressing  is  more  likely.   <b>-Wimplied-reg</b>  Warns if implied
            addressing is used instead of register.  Some instructions have implied aliases like 'asl' for  'asl
            a' for compatibility reasons, but this shorthand not the preferred form.

       <b>-Wleading-zeros</b>
            Warns  if  about  leading zeros.  A leading zero could be a prefix for an octal number but as octals
            are not supported so the result will be decimal.

       <b>-Wlong-branch</b>
            Warns when a long branch is used.  This option gives a warning for instructions which were  modified
            by the long branch function.  Less intrusive than disabling long branches and see where it fails.

       <b>-Wmacro-prefix</b>
            Warn  about  macro  call  without  prefix.   Such macro calls can easily be mistaken to be labels if
            invoked without parameters.  Also it's hard to notice that an unchanged call turned into label after
            the definition got renamed. This warning helps to find such calls so that prefixes can be added.

       <b>-Wno-deprecated</b>
            Don't warn about deprecated features.  Unfortunately there were some features added previously which
            shouldn't have been included. This option disables warnings about their uses.

       <b>-Wno-float-compare</b>
            Don't warn if floating point comparisons are only approximate.  Floating point numbers have a finite
            precision and comparing them might give unexpected results.

       <b>-Wno-float-round</b>
            Don't warn when floating point numbers are implicitly rounded.  A lot of  parameters  are  expecting
            integers  but floating point numbers are accepted as well. The style of rounding used may or may not
            be what you wanted.

       <b>-Wno-ignored</b>
            Don't warn about ignored directives.

       <b>-Wno-jmp-bug</b>
            Don't warn about the jmp ($xxff) bug.  It's fine that the high byte is read from the 'wrong' address
            on 6502, NMOS 6502 and 65DTV02.

       <b>-Wno-label-left</b>
            Don't warn about certain labels not being on left side.  You may disable  this  if  you  use  labels
            which  look like mistyped versions of implied addressing mode instructions and you don't want to put
            them in the first column.

       <b>-Wno-page</b>
            Don't do an error for page crossing.

       <b>-Wno-pitfalls</b>
            Don't note on common pitfalls.  Experts don't need notes about how to fix things ;)

       <b>-Wno-portable</b>
            Don't warn about source portability problems.

       <b>-Wno-size-larger</b>
            Don't warn if size is larger due to negative offset Negative offsets add space in  front  of  memory
            area that's out of bound. Sometimes this may be fine.

       <b>-Wno-priority</b>
            Don't  warn  about  operator priority problems.  Not all of the unary operators are strongly binding
            and this may cause surprises.

       <b>-Wno-star-assign</b>
            Don't warn about ignored compound multiply.

       <b>-Wno-wrap-addr</b>
            Don't warn about address space calculation wrap around.  If a memory location ends up outside of the
            processors address space then just wrap it around.

       <b>-Wno-wrap-bank0</b>
            Don't warn for bank 0 address calculation wrap around.

       <b>-Wno-wrap-dpage</b>
            Don't warn for direct page address calculation wrap around.

       <b>-Wno-wrap-mem</b>
            Don't warn for compile offset wrap around.  Continue from the beginning of image file once it's  end
            was reached.

       <b>-Wno-wrap-pbank</b>
            Don't warn for program bank address calculation wrap around.

       <b>-Wno-wrap-pc</b>
            Don't  warn  for  program counter bank crossing.  If it's data only and the programmer deals with it
            then this might be ok.

       <b>-Wold-equal</b>
            Warn about old equal operator.  The single '=' operator is only there for compatibility reasons  and
            should be written as '==' normally.

       <b>-Woptimize</b>
            Warn  about  optimizable  code.   Warns on things that could be optimized, at least according to the
            limited analysis done.

       <b>-Wshadow</b>
            Warn about symbol shadowing.  Checks if local variables 'shadow' other variables  of  same  name  in
            upper scopes in ambiguous ways.

       <b>-Wstrict-bool</b>
            Warn about implicit boolean conversions.  Boolean values can be interpreted as numeric 0/1 and other
            types as booleans. This is convenient but may cause mistakes.

       <b>-Wunused</b>
            Warn about unused constant symbols, any type.

       <b>-Wunused-const</b>
            Warn about unused constants.

       <b>-Wunused-label</b>
            Warn about unused labels.

       <b>-Wunused-macro</b>
            Warn about unused macros.

       <b>-Wunused-variable</b>
            Warn about unused variables.

   <b>Target</b> <b>selection</b> <b>options</b>

   <b>Symbol</b> <b>listing</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-l</b> <u>file</u>, --labels=<u>file</u>
            List labels into <u>file</u>. May be used multiple times. The format is  remembered  but  root  reverts  to
            global after each file.

       <b>--labels-append</b>=<u>file</u>
            Append labels to <u>file</u> instead of overwriting it.

       <b>--labels-root</b>=<u>&lt;expression&gt;</u>

            Adds a prefix for some output formats.

       <b>--normal-labels</b>
            Lists labels in a 64tass readable format. (default)

       <b>--export-labels</b>
            List  labels  for include in a 64tass readable format. This will always compile exported .proc/.pend
            blocks assuming they're needed externally.

       <b>--vice-labels</b>
            List labels in a VICE readable format.

            List labels in Mesen format.

   <b>Assembly</b> <b>listing</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-L</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--list</b>=<u>file</u>
            List into <u>file</u>. Dumps source code and compiled code into  file.  Useful  for  debugging,  it's  much
            easier to identify the code in memory within the source files.

       <b>--list-append</b>=<u>file</u>
            Append list to <u>file</u> instead of overwriting it.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--no-monitor</b>
            Don't put monitor code into listing. There won't be any monitor listing in the list file.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--no-source</b>
            Don't put source code into listing. There won't be any source listing in the list file.

       <b>--line-numbers</b>
            This  option  creates  a  new  column  for  showing line numbers for easier identification of source
            origin.

       <b>--tab-size</b>=<u>number</u>
            By default the listing file is using a tab size of 8 to align the disassembly. This can  be  changed
            to other more favorable values like 4.  Only spaces are used if 1 is selected. Please note that this
            has no effect on the source code on the right hand side.

       <b>--verbose-list</b>
            Normally  the  assembler  tries  to  minimize  listing  output  by omitting 'unimportant' lines. But
            sometimes it's better to just list everything including comments and empty lines.

   <b>Other</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Give this help list. Prints help about command line options.

       <b>--usage</b>
            Give a short usage message. Prints short help about command line options.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
            Print program version.
