</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       recon - Check if LAM can be started.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       recon [-a] [-b] [-d] [-h] [-v] [-nn] [-np] [-ssi key value] [bhost]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>      Report all host errors.

       <b>-b</b>      Assume  local and remote shell are the same.  This means that only one remote shell invocation is
               used to each node.  If <b>-b</b> is not used, two remote shell invocations are used to each node.

       <b>-d</b>      Turn on debugging.

       <b>-h</b>      Print the command help menu.

       <b>-ssi</b> <b>key</b> <b>value</b>
               Send arguments to various SSI modules.  See the "SSI" section, below.

       <b>-v</b>      Be verbose.

       <b>-nn</b>     Don't add "-n" to the remote agent command line

       <b>-np</b>     Do not force the execution of $HOME/.profile on remote hosts

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In order for LAM to be started on a remote UNIX machine, several requirements have to be fulfilled:

       1)     The machine must be reachable via the network.

       2)     The user must be able to remotely execute on the machine with the  default  remote  shell  program
              that  was chosen when LAM was configured.  This is usually <a href="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh</a>(1), but any remote shell program is
              acceptable (such as <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a>(1), etc.).  Note that remote host permission must be configured such  that
              the remote shell program will not ask for a password when a command is invoked on remote host.

       3)     The remote user's shell must have a search path that will locate LAM executables.

       4)     The  remote  shell's  startup  file  must  not  print anything to standard error when invoked non-
              interactively.

       If any of these requirements is not met for any machine declared in <u>bhost</u>, LAM will not be able to start.
       By running <u>recon</u> first, the user will be able to quickly identify and correct problems in the setup  that
       would inhibit LAM from starting.

       The local machine where <u>recon</u> is invoked must be one of the machines specified in <u>bhost</u>.

       The  <u>bhost</u>  file  is  a  LAM  boot schema written in the host file syntax.  See <a href="../man5/bhost.5.html">bhost</a>(5).  Instead of the
       command line, a boot schema can be specified in the LAMBHOST environment variable.  Otherwise  a  default
       file,  bhost.def,  is  used.   LAM  seaches  for  <u>bhost</u>  first  in  the  local  directory and then in the
       installation directory under etc/.

       <u>recon</u> tests each machine defined in <u>bhost</u> by attempting to execute on it the <a href="../man1/tkill.1.html">tkill</a>(1) command  using  its
       "pretend"  option  (no  action  is taken).  This test, if successful, indicates that all the requirements
       listed above are met, and thus LAM can be started on the machine.  If the attempt is successful, the next
       machine is checked.  In case the attempt fails, a descriptive error message is displayed and <u>recon</u>  stops
       unless the <u>-a</u> option is used, in which case <u>recon</u> continues checking the remaining machines.

       If  <u>recon</u>  takes  a long time to finish successfully, this will be a good indication to the user that the
       LAM system to be started has slow communication links  or  heavily  loaded  machines,  and  it  might  be
       preferable to exclude or replace some of the machines in the system.

   <b>SSI</b> <b>(System</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Interface)</b>
       The <u>-ssi</u> switch allows the passing of parameters to various SSI modules.  LAM's SSI modules are described
       in  detail  in  <a href="../man7/lamssi.7.html">lamssi</a>(7).   SSI  modules  have  direct impact on MPI programs because they allow tunable
       parameters to be set at run time (such as which boot device driver to use, what  parameters  to  pass  to
       that driver, etc.).

       The  <u>-ssi</u>  switch  takes  two  arguments:  <u>key</u> and <u>value</u>.  The <u>key</u> argument generally specifies which SSI
       module will receive the value.  For example, the <u>key</u> "boot" is used to select which RPI to  be  used  for
       starting processes on remote nodes.  The <u>value</u> argument is the value that is passed.  For example:

       recon -ssi boot tm
           Tells  LAM  to use the "tm" boot module for native launching in PBSPro / OpenPBS environments (the tm
           boot module does not require a boot schema).

       recon -ssi boot rsh -ssi rsh_agent "ssh -x" boot_file
           Tells LAM to use the "rsh" boot module, and tells the rsh module to use  "ssh  -x"  as  the  specific
           agent to launch executables on remote nodes.

       And  so  on.   LAM's boot SSI modules are described in <a href="../man7/lamssi_boot.7.html">lamssi_boot</a>(7).  This page should be consulted for
       specific actions that are taken by, and how to tweak the run-time behavior of each boot module.

       The <u>-ssi</u> switch can be used multiple times to specify different <u>key</u> and/or <u>value</u> arguments.  If the  same
       <u>key</u> is specified more than once, the <u>value</u>s are concatenated with a comma (",") separating them.

       Note that the <u>-ssi</u> switch is simply a shortcut for setting environment variables.  The same effect may be
       accomplished  by  setting  corresponding  environment  variables before running <u>lamboot</u>.  The form of the
       environment variables that LAM sets are: <u>LAM_MPI_SSI_key=value</u>.

       Note that the <u>-ssi</u> switch overrides any previously set environment variables.  Also note that unknown <u>key</u>
       arguments are still set as environment variable -- they are not checked  (by  <u>lamwipe</u>)  for  correctness.
       Illegal or incorrect <u>value</u> arguments may or may not be reported -- it depends on the specific SSI module.

   <b>Remote</b> <b>Executable</b> <b>Invocation</b>
       All  tweakable  aspects  of launching executables on remote nodes during <u>recon</u> are discussed in <a href="../man7/lamssi.7.html">lamssi</a>(7)
       and <a href="../man7/lamssi_boot.7.html">lamssi_boot</a>(7).  Topics include (but are  not  limited  to):  discovery  of  remote  shell,  run-time
       overrides of the agent use to launch remote executables (e.g., rsh and ssh), etc.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       laminstalldir/etc/lam-bhost.def   default  boot schema file, where "laminstalldir" is the directory where
                                         LAM/MPI was installed.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       recon -v mynodes
           Check if LAM can be started on all the UNIX machines described in the boot  schema  <u>mynodes</u>.   Report
           about important steps as they are done.

       recon -v -a
           Check  if  LAM  can be started on all the UNIX machines described in the default boot schema.  Report
           about important steps as they are done.  Check all the machines; do not stop after  the  first  error
           message.
