</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       devdump, isoinfo, isovfy, isodump - Utility programs for dumping and verifying iso9660 images.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>devdump</b> <u>isoimage</u>

       <b>isodump</b> <u>isoimage</u>

       <b>isoinfo</b>  [ <b>-d</b> ] [ <b>-h</b> ] [ <b>-R</b> ] [ <b>-J</b> ] [ <b>-j</b> <u>charset</u> ] [ <b>-f</b> ] [ <b>-l</b> ] [ <b>-p</b> ] [ <b>-T</b> <u>sector</u> ] [ <b>-N</b> <u>sector</u> ] [ <b>-i</b>
       <u>isoimage</u> ] [ <b>-x</b> <u>path</u> ]

       <b>isovfy</b> <u>isoimage</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>devdump</b> is a crude utility to interactively display the contents of device  or  filesystem  images.   The
       initial  screen  is a display of the first 256 bytes of the first 2048 byte sector.  The commands are the
       same as with <b>isodump</b>.

       <b>isodump</b> is a crude utility to interactively display the contents of iso9660 images  in  order  to  verify
       directory  integrity.   The  initial screen is a display of the first part of the root directory, and the
       prompt shows you the extent number and offset in the extent.

              You can use the 'a' and 'b' commands to move backwards and forwards  within  the  image.  The  'g'
              command  allows  you to goto an arbitrary extent, and the 'f' command specifies a search string to
              be used. The '+' command searches forward for the next instance of the search string, and the  'q'
              command exits <b>devdump</b> or <b>isodump</b>.

       <b>isoinfo</b> is a utility to perform directory like listings of iso9660 images.

       <b>isovfy</b>  is  a utility to verify the integrity of an iso9660 image. Most of the tests in <b>isovfy</b> were added
       after bugs were discovered in early versions of <b>genisoimage.</b>  It isn't all that clear how useful this  is
       anymore, but it doesn't hurt to have this around.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  options  common  to  all  programs  are <b>-help</b>,<b>-h</b>,<b>-version</b>, <b>i</b><u>=name,</u><b>dev</b><u>=name.</u>  The <b>isoinfo</b> program has
       additional command line options. The options are:

       <b>-help</b>

       <b>-h</b>     print a summary of all options.

       <b>-d</b>     Print information from the primary volume descriptor (PVD) of the  iso9660  image.  This  includes
              information about Rock Ridge, Joliet extensions and Eltorito boot information if present.

       <b>-f</b>     generate  output as if a 'find . -print' command had been run on the iso9660 image. You should not
              use the <b>-l</b> image with the <b>-f</b> option.

       <b>-i</b> <b>iso_image</b>
              Specifies the path of the iso9660 image that we wish to examine.  The options  <b>-i</b>  and  <b>dev=</b><u>target</u>
              are mutual exclusive.

       <b>dev=</b><u>target</u>
              Sets  the SCSI target for the drive, see notes above.  A typical device specification is <b>dev=</b><u>6,0</u> .
              If a filename must be provided together with the numerical target specification, the  filename  is
              implementation  specific.   The  correct filename in this case can be found in the system specific
              manuals of the target operating system.  On a <u>FreeBSD</u> system without <u>CAM</u> support, you need to  use
              the  control  device  (e.g.   <u>/dev/rcd0.ctl</u>).   A correct device specification in this case may be
              <b>dev=</b><u>/dev/rcd0.ctl:@</u> .

              On Linux, drives connected to a parallel port adapter are mapped to a virtual SCSI bus.  Different
              adapters are mapped to different targets on this virtual SCSI bus.

              If  no  <u>dev</u>  option  is  present,  the  program  will  try  to  get the device from the <b>CDR_DEVICE</b>
              environment.

              If the argument to the <b>dev=</b> option does not contain the characters ',', '/', '@'  or  ':',  it  is
              interpreted as an label name that may be found in the file /etc/wodim.conf (see FILES section).

              The options <b>-i</b> and <b>dev=</b><u>target</u> are mutual exclusive.

       <b>-l</b>     generate  output  as  if a 'ls -lR' command had been run on the iso9660 image.  You should not use
              the <b>-f</b> image with the <b>-l</b> option.

       <b>-N</b> <b>sector</b>
              Quick hack to help examine single session disc files that are to be  written  to  a  multi-session
              disc.  The  sector  number  specified  is  the  sector number at which the iso9660 image should be
              written when send to the cd-writer. Not used for the first session on the disc.

       <b>-p</b>     Print path table information.

       <b>-R</b>     Extract information from Rock Ridge extensions  (if  present)  for  permissions,  file  names  and
              ownerships.

       <b>-J</b>     Extract information from Joliet extensions (if present) for file names.

       <b>-j</b> <b>charset</b>
              Convert Joliet file names (if present) to the supplied charset. See <b><a href="../man8/genisoimage.8.html">genisoimage</a></b>(8) for details.

       <b>-T</b> <b>sector</b>
              Quick  hack  to help examine multi-session images that have already been burned to a multi-session
              disc. The sector number specified is the sector number for the start of the  session  we  wish  to
              display.

       <b>-x</b> <b>pathname</b>
              Extract specified file to stdout.

       &lt;<a href="mailto:eric@andante.jic.com">eric@andante.jic.com</a>&gt; is to blame for these shoddy hacks.  Joerg  Schilling  wrote  the  SCSI  transport
       library  and  its adaptation layer to the programs and newer parts (starting from 1999) of the utilities,
       this makes them Copyright (C) 1999-2004 Joerg Schilling.  Patches to improve general usability  would  be
       gladly accepted.

       This  manpage  describes the program implementation of <b>isoinfo</b> as shipped by the cdrkit distribution. See
       <b><a href="http://alioth.debian.org/projects/debburn/">http://alioth.debian.org/projects/debburn/</a></b> for details.  It  is  a  spinoff  from  the  original  program
       distributed  in  the  cdrtools  package  [1].  However,  the  cdrtools developers are not involved in the
       development of this spinoff and therefore shall not be made responsible for any problem caused by it.  Do
       not try to get support for this program by contacting the original author(s).

       If you have support questions, send them to

       <b><a href="mailto:debburn-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org">debburn-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org</a></b>

       If you have definitely found a bug, send a mail to this list or to

       <b><a href="mailto:submit@bugs.debian.org">submit@bugs.debian.org</a></b>

       writing  at  least  a short description into the Subject and "Package: cdrkit" into the first line of the
       mail body.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The user interface really sucks.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>IMPROVEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       These utilities are really quick hacks, which are very useful for debugging problems in genisoimage or in
       an iso9660 filesystem. In the long run, it would be nice to have a daemon that would NFS export a iso9660
       image.

       The isoinfo program is probably the program that is of the most use to the general user.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       These   utilities   come   with   the   <b>cdrkit</b>   package,   and   the   primary    download    site    is
       <a href="http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/">http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/</a>  and  FTP  mirrors of distributions.  Despite the name, the software is
       not beta.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>CDR_DEVICE</b>
              This may either hold a device identifier that is suitable to the open call of the  SCSI  transport
              library or a label in the file /etc/wodim.conf.

       <b>RSH</b>    If  the  <b>RSH</b>  environment is present, the remote connection will not be created via <b><a href="../man3/rcmd.3.html">rcmd</a></b>(3) but by
              calling the program pointed to by <b>RSH</b>.  Use  e.g.   <b>RSH=</b><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?ssh">/usr/bin/ssh</a>  to  create  a  secure  shell
              connection.

              Note that this forces the program to create a pipe to the <b><a href="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh</a>(1)</b> program and disallows the program
              to  directly  access  the network socket to the remote server.  This makes it impossible to set up
              performance parameters and slows  down  the  connection  compared  to  a  <b>root</b>  initiated  <b><a href="../man3/rcmd.3.html">rcmd</a>(3)</b>
              connection.

       <b>RSCSI</b>  If   the  <b>RSCSI</b>  environment  is  present,  the  remote  SCSI  server  will  not  be  the  program
              <b>/opt/schily/sbin/rscsi</b> but the program pointed to by <b>RSCSI</b>.  Note  that  the  remote  SCSI  server
              program  name  will  be ignored if you log in using an account that has been created with a remote
              SCSI server program as login shell.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/wodim.conf
              Default values can be set for the following options in /etc/wodim.conf.

              CDR_DEVICE
                     This may either hold a device identifier that is suitable to the  open  call  of  the  SCSI
                     transport library or a label in the file /etc/wodim.conf that allows to identify a specific
                     drive on the system.

              Any other label
                     is  an  identifier  for a specific drive on the system.  Such an identifier may not contain
                     the characters ',', '/', '@' or ':'.

                     Each line that follows a label contains a TAB separated list  of  items.   Currently,  four
                     items  are  recognized: the SCSI ID of the drive, the default speed that should be used for
                     this drive, the default FIFO size that should be used for this  drive  and  drive  specific
                     options.  The values for <u>speed</u> and <u>fifosize</u> may be set to -1 to tell the program to use the
                     global defaults.  The value for driveropts may be set to "" if no driveropts are  used.   A
                     typical line may look this way:

                     teac1= 0,5,0   4    8m   ""

                     yamaha= 1,6,0  -1   -1   burnfree

                     This tells the program that a drive named <u>teac1</u> is at scsibus 0, target 5, lun 0 and should
                     be  used  with  speed 4 and a FIFO size of 8 MB.  A second drive may be found at scsibus 1,
                     target 6, lun 0 and uses the default speed and the default FIFO size.
