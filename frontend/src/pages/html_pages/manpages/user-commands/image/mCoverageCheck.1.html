       mCoverageCheck  -  Filter  an  image  metadata  table  down to those records representing FITS files that
       overlap a footprint on the sky

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       mCoverageCheck [-s <u>statusfile</u>] in.tbl out.tbl -<u>mode</u> &lt;parameters&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mCoverageCheck</b> can be used to subset an image metadata table (containing FITS/WCS  information  or  image
       corners) by determining which records in the table represent images that overlap with a region definition
       (box or circle in the sky) given on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -s <u>statusfile</u>
              Output and errors are sent to <u>statusfile</u> instead of to stdout

       -<u>mode</u>  Can be one of:

              points  (used to describe a convex polygon) box circle header (area is described in a header file)
              point (find images that overlap one particular point on the sky) cutout (operates like  <u>box</u>  mode,
              but  returns  metadata that represents what the input images would look like after being subset to
              exactly match the cutout area)

       in.tbl Input metadata table.

       out.tbl
              Output metadata table, to contain subset of in.tbl.

       <u>parameters</u>
              Depends on mode as following:

              <u>points</u>: <b>ra1</b> <b>dec1</b> <b>ra2</b> <b>dec2</b> <b>...</b> <b>raN</b> <b>decN</b> (must be at least 3 vertices)  <u>box</u>:  <b>ra</b>  <b>dec</b>  <b>xsize</b>  <b>[ysize</b>
              <b>[rotation]]</b>

              where <u>ra,</u> <u>dec</u> is the center of the box, and <u>size</u> is in degrees.  <u>circle</u>: <b>ra</b> <b>dec</b> <b>radius</b>

              where  <u>ra,</u>  <u>dec</u> is the center of the circle, and <u>radius</u> is in degrees (default is 0, in which case
              it's treated like a point search).  <u>point</u>: <b>ra</b> <b>dec</b> <u>header</u>: <b>region.hdr</b>  (path  to  an  ASCII  header
              template that defines the region of interest) <u>cutout</u>: <b>ra</b> <b>dec</b> <b>xsize</b> <b>[ysize]</b>

              where <u>ra,</u> <u>dec</u> is the center of the cutout area, and <u>size</u> is in degrees.

</pre><h4><b>RESULT</b></h4><pre>
       The output file <u>out.tbl</u> is created, with <u>nimages</u> records.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       As  input,  we use this table of 2MASS atlas images.  The images in this table are in two "clumps" on the
       sky: 3 overlapping images separated by several degrees from the other 12  overlapping  images.   Here  we
       will show several ways of isolating the group of 3 images.

       $ mCoverageCheck images.tbl circle.tbl -circle 262.78208 -35.03049 1.0
              [struct stat="OK", count="3"]

       $ mCoverageCheck images.tbl box.tbl -box 262.84948 -34.81197 1.0
              [struct stat="OK", count="3"]

       $ mCoverageCheck images.tbl points.tbl -points 263.3796 -34.48881 262.15127 -34.51032 262.90267 -35.38753
              [struct stat="OK", count="3"]

       $ mCoverageCheck images.tbl point.tbl -point 262.78208 -35.03049
              [struct stat="OK", count="3"]

       Each of these methods results in this output table containing only 3 records out of the original 15.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The drizzle algorithm has been implemented but has not been tested in this release.

       If a header template contains carriage returns (i.e., created/modified on a Windows machine), the cfitsio
       library  will  be  unable  to read it properly, resulting in the error: [struct stat="ERROR", status=207,
       msg="illegal character in keyword"]

       It is best for the background correction  algorithms  if  the  area  described  in  the  header  template
       completely encloses all of the input images in their entirety. If parts of input images are "chopped off"
       by  the  header  template,  the  background correction will be affected. We recommend you use an expanded
       header for the reprojection and background modeling steps, returning to  the  originally  desired  header
       size  for  the  final  coaddition.  The  default background matching assumes that there are no non-linear
       background variations in the individual images (and therefore in the overlap differences).  If  there  is
       any  uncertainty  in  this  regard, it is safer to turn on the "level only" background matching (the "-l"
       flag in mBgModel.
