       ppmfade - generate a transition between two image files using special effects

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ppmfade</b>  [<b>-f</b>  <u>first.ppm</u>]  [<b>-l</b>  <u>last.ppm</u>] [<b>-mix</b>|<b>-spread</b>|<b>-shift</b>| <b>-relief</b>|<b>-oil</b>|<b>-edge</b>|<b>-bentley</b>|<b>-block</b>] [<b>-base</b>
       <u>name</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>ppmfade</b>generates a transition between either two input images or between one input image and black.   You
       can  use  the  30  intermediate images generated to show a smooth transition between segments of a movie.
       The input and output images are in the PPM format.  If you specify both input images, they should both be
       the same size.  If you want to fade from black to an image, specify only the last image.  If you want  to
       fade  from  an  image  to  black,  specify only the first image.  <b>ppmfade</b> names the resulting image files
       <u>base</u><b>.</b><u>nnnn</u><b>.ppm</b>, where <u>nnnn</u> is a number varying between 0001 and 0030 and <u>base</u> is what you specify with via
       the <b>-base</b> option (default <b>fade</b>).

       Another way to convert by steps from one image to another is morphing.  You can use <b>xmorph</b> to do that.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably  <b>-quiet</b>,  see   Common
       Options ), <b>ppmfade</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       <b>-f</b> <u>first.ppm</u>
              This  is  the image file (PPM format) to be used at the beginning of the transition.  If you don't
              specify this, the fade will start from black.

       <b>-l</b> <u>last.ppm</u>
              This is the image file (PPM format) to be used at the ending of  the  transition.   If  you  don't
              specify this, the fade will end with black.

       <b>-mix</b>   The  two  images  are  superimposed with the brightness of the first image decreasing from full to
              none and the brightness of the final image increasing  from  none  to  full.   The  transition  is
              quadratic in brightness with faster transition in the beginning and slower at the end.

       <b>-spread</b>
              The  pixels  in  the  first  image  will be moved (spread) further and further from their original
              location and then moved into the proper  location  in  the  final  image.   This  is  the  default
              transition.

       <b>-shift</b> The pixels in the first image will be shifted further and further horizontally from their original
              location and then moved into the proper location in the final image.

       <b>-relief</b>
              The  first image is faded to a Laplacian relief filtered version of the first image.  This is then
              faded to a Laplacian relief filtered version of the second image and finally faded  to  the  final
              image.

       <b>-oil</b>   The  first  image is faded to an "oil transfer" version of the first image.  This is then faded to
              an "oil transfer" version of the second image and finally faded to the final image.

       <b>-edge</b>  The first image is faded to an edge detected version of the first image.  This is then faded to an
              edge detected version of the second image and finally faded to the final image.

       <b>-bentley</b>
               The first image is faded to a "Bentley Effect" version of the first image.  This is then faded to
              a "Bentley Effect" version of the second image and finally faded to the final image.

       <b>-block</b> The first image is defocused to small blocks.  The small blocks are converted to match a defocused
              version of the last image.  The block version of the last image  is  then  focused  to  the  final
              image.

       <b>-base</b> <u>name</u>
              This forms part of the output filenames, as described above.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ppmfade</b> <b>-f</b> <b>teapot.ppm</b> <b>-l</b> <b>pyr.ppm</b>

       Fade from teapot.ppm to pyr.ppm generating fade.0001.ppm to fade.0030.ppm using the "spread" transition.

       <b>ppmfade</b> <b>-l</b> <b>teapot.ppm</b>

       Fade from black to teapot.ppm generating fade.0001.ppm to fade.0030.ppm.

       <b>ppmfade</b> <b>-f</b> <b>teapot.ppm</b> <b>-base</b> <b>end</b>

       Fade from teapot.ppm to black generating end.0001.ppm to end.0030.ppm.
