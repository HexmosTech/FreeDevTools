       h5topng - generate PNG images from 2d slices of HDF5 files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>h5topng</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>HDF5FILE</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       h5topng  is  a  utility to generate images in PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format from two-dimensional
       slices of datasets in HDF5 files.  It is designed for quick-and-dirty visualization of  scientific  data,
       and for batch processing thereof via shell scripts.

       HDF5  is  a  free,  portable  binary  format  and supporting library developed by the National Center for
       Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.   A  single  <u>h5</u>  file  can
       contain  multiple data sets; by default, <u>h5topng</u> takes the first dataset, but this can be changed via the
       <b>-d</b> option, or by using the syntax <u>HDF5FILE:DATASET</u>.

       For a three- or four-dimensional dataset you must specify coordinates in one  or  two  slice  dimensions,
       respectively,  to  get  a  two-dimensional slice, via the <b>-xyzt</b> options.  Yet more options control things
       like the colormap and magnification.  Still, the most basic usage is  something  like  'h5topng  foo.h5',
       which will output a file foo.png containing an image from the two-dimensional data in foo.h5.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Display help on the command-line options and usage.

       <b>-V</b>     Print the version number and copyright info for h5topng.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose  output.   This  output  includes  the minimum and maximum values encountered in the data,
              which is useful to know for the <b>-mM</b> options.

       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>
              Send PNG output to <u>file</u> rather than to the filename with .h5 replaced with .png (the default).

       <b>-x</b> <u>ix</u>, <b>-y</b> <u>iy</u>, <b>-z</b> <u>iz</u>, <b>-t</b> <u>it</u>
              This tells <u>h5topng</u> to use a particular slice of a multi-dimensional dataset.  e.g.  <b>-x</b> causes a yz
              plane (of a 3d dataset) to be used, at an x index of <u>ix</u> (where the indices run from  zero  to  one
              less  than the maximum index in that direction).  Here, x/y/z correspond to the first/second/third
              dimensions of the HDF5 dataset. The <b>-t</b> option specifies a slice in the last  dimension,  whichever
              that  might  be.  See also the <b>-0</b> option to shift the origin of the x/y/z slice coordinates to the
              dataset center.

              Instead of specifying a single index as an argument to these options, you can also specify a range
              of indices in a Matlab-like notation: <u>start</u>:<u>step</u>:<u>end</u> or <u>start</u>:<u>end</u>  (<u>step</u>  defaults  to  1).   This
              loops  over  that  slice index, from <u>start</u> to <u>end</u> in steps of <u>step</u>, producing a sequence of output
              PNG files (with the slice index appended to the filename, before the ".png").

       <b>-0</b>     Shift the origin of the x/y/z slice coordinates to the dataset center, so that e.g. -0  -x  0  (or
              more  compactly -0x0) returns the central x plane of the dataset instead of the edge x plane.  (<b>-t</b>
              coordinates are not affected.)

       <b>-X</b> <u>scalex</u>, <b>-Y</b> <u>scaley</u>, <b>-S</b> <u>scale</u>
              Scale the x and y dimensions of the image by <u>scalex</u> and <u>scaley</u> respectively.  The <b>-S</b> option scales
              both x and y.  The default is to use scale factors of 1.0; i.e. the image has the same  dimensions
              (in  pixels)  as  the  data.   Linear  interpolation  is used to fill in the pixels when the scale
              factors are not 1.0.

       <b>-s</b> <u>skewangle</u>
              Skew the image by <u>skewangle</u> (in degrees) to the left or right.  The  result  is  a  parallelogram,
              with  the leftover space in the (square) image filled with either black or white pixels, depending
              upon the color map.

       <b>-T</b>     Transpose the data (interchange the image axes).  By default, the first (x) coordinate of the data
              corresponds to the columns, and the second (y) coordinate corresponds to the  rows;  transposition
              reverses this convention.

       <b>-c</b> <u>colormap</u>
              Use  a  color  map <u>colormap</u> rather than the default <b>gray</b> color map (a grayscale ramp from white to
              black).  <u>colormap</u> is normally the name of one of the color maps  provided  with  <u>h5topng</u>  (in  the
              /usr/share/h5utils/colormaps directory), or can instead be the name of a color-map file.

              Three  useful  included  color  maps  are <b>hot</b> (black-red-yellow-white, useful for intensity data),
              <b>bluered</b> (blue-white-red, useful for signed data), and <b>hsv</b> (a multi-color "rainbow").  If  you  use
              the  <b>bluered</b>  color map for signed data, you may also want to use the <b>-Z</b> option so that the center
              of the color scale (white) corresponds to zero.

              A color-map file is a sequence of whitespace-separated R G B A quadruples, where each value is  in
              the  range  0.0  to  1.0  and  indicates  the fraction of red/green/blue/alpha.  (An alpha of 0 is
              transparent and of 1 is opaque; this is only used for the <b>-a</b> option, below.)  The  colors  in  the
              color map are linearly interpolated as necessary to provide a continuous color ramp.

       <b>-r</b>     Reverse  the  ordering of the color map.  You can also accomplish this by putting a "-" before the
              colormap name in the <b>-c</b> or <b>-a</b> option.

       <b>-Z</b>     Center the color scale on the value zero in the data.

       <b>-m</b> <u>min</u>, <b>-M</b> <u>max</u>
              Normally, the bottom and top of the color map correspond to the minimum and maximum values in  the
              data.  Using these options, you can make the bottom and top of the color map correspond to <u>min</u> and
              <u>max</u>  instead.   Data  values  below or above this range will be treated as if they were <u>min</u> or <u>max</u>
              respectively.  See also the <b>-Z</b> and <b>-R</b> options.

       <b>-R</b>     When multiple files are specified, set the bottom and top of  the  color  maps  according  to  the
              minimum  and  maximum  over all the data.  This is useful to process many files using a consistent
              color scale, since otherwise the scale is set for each file individually.

       <b>-C</b> <u>file</u>, <b>-b</b> <u>val</u>
              Superimpose contour outlines from the first dataset in the <u>file</u> HDF5 file on  all  of  the  output
              images.   (If  the  contour  dataset  does  not have the same dimensions as the output data, it is
              peridically "tiled" over the output.)  You can use the syntax <u>file:dataset</u> to specify a particular
              dataset within the file.  The contour outlines are around a value of <u>val</u> (defaults  to  middle  of
              value range in <u>file</u>).

       <b>-A</b> <u>file</u>, <b>-a</b> <u>colormap</u>:<u>opacity</u>
              Translucently overlay the data from the first dataset in the <u>file</u> HDF5 file, which should have the
              same  dimensions  as  the  input dataset, on all of the output images, using the colormap <u>colormap</u>
              with opacity (from 0 for completely transparent to 1 for completely opaque) <u>opacity</u> multiplied  by
              the  opacity  (alpha)  values  in  the  colormap.   (If the overlay dataset does not have the same
              dimensions as the output data, it is peridically "tiled" over the output.)  You can use the syntax
              <u>file:dataset</u> to specify a particular dataset within the file.

              Some predefined colormaps that work particularly well for this  feature  are  <b>yellow</b>  (transparent
              white  to  opaque  yellow)  <b>gray</b>  (transparent  white to opaque black), <b>yarg</b> (transparent black to
              opaque white), <b>green</b> (transparent white to opaque green), and <b>bluered</b> (opaque blue to  transparent
              white  to  opaque  red).   You can prepend "-" to the colormap name to reverse the colormap order.
              (See also <b>-c</b>, above.)  The default for  <b>-a</b>  is  yellow:0.3  (yellow  colormap  multiplied  by  30%
              opacity).

       <b>-d</b> <u>name</u>
              Use  dataset  <u>name</u>  from  the  input  files;  otherwise, the first dataset from each file is used.
              Alternatively, use the syntax <u>HDF5FILE:DATASET</u>, which allows you to specify  a  different  dataset
              for  each  file.   You can use the <u>h5ls</u> command (included with hdf5) to find the names of datasets
              within a file.

       <b>-8</b>     Use 8-bit (indexed) color for the PNG output, instead of  24-bit  (direct)  color  (the  default).
              (This  shrinks  the  image  size  slightly,  with  some degradation in quality.)  Not supported in
              conjunction with the <b>-A</b> (translucent overlay) option.
