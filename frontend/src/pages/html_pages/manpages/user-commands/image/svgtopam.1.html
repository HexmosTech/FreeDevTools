       svgtopam - convert an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image to Netpbm format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>svgtopam</b> [<b>-trace</b>] [<u>pnmfile</u>]

       Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use double hyphens instead of single hyphen
       to  denote  options.  You may use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name from
       its value.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>svgtopam</b> reads an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image as input and produces a PAM image as output.

       <b>svgtopam</b> is so weak that it is probably not useful in general for converting SVG images.  It  understands
       only  &lt;path&gt;  SVG  elements  which use only the "M", "L", and "z" commands, and only those that use whole
       number arguments.  This is sufficient for  converting  most  of  what  comes  out  of  <b>pamtosvg</b>  (not  by
       coincidence  -  the program was developed for the specific task of testing <b>pamtosvg</b>), but the main reason
       it is part of Netpbm is to provide a base for someone to create a full SVG to Netpbm converter.

       SVG is a vector image format, which means it describes curves that compose an image.  By contrast, PNM is
       a raster format, which means it describes dots that compose an  image.   The  main  practical  difference
       between  the  two types is that you can scale vector images better.  A vector image also takes a lot less
       data to describe an image if the image is composed of simple curves.

       That means it is really an understatement to say that <b>svgtopam</b> is an image format converter.  It's really
       an image drawer, not unlike <b>ppmdraw</b>.

       For more information on SVG, see the Worldwide Web Consortium's SVG web page .

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably  <b>-quiet</b>,  see   Common
       Options ), <b>svgtopam</b> recognizes the following command line option:

       <b>-trace</b> This option makes <b>svgtopam</b> issue messages describing the drawing.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>svgtopam</b> was added to Netpbm in Version 10.34 (May 2006).

       Bryan Henderson created <b>svgtopam</b> to test <b>pamtosvg</b>.
