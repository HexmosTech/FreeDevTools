</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>posterazor</b> - splits an image across multiple pages for assembly into a poster

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>posterazor</b> [ <u>inputfile</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  PosteRazor  splits  an  image  to  form  a  multi-page PDF document. When printed, the sheets can be
       arranged to form a large poster of the original image.

       If no <u>inputfile</u> is specified as a command line argument, the user will be prompted for one.

       Current Features:

              <b>Input</b> <b>image</b> <b>formats</b>
                     All image formats that FreeImage can read should be usable as  input  for  the  PosteRazor:
                     BMP,  DDS,  Dr.  Halo,  GIF, ICO, IFF, JBIG, JPEG/JIF, KOALA, LBM, Kodak PhotoCD, PCX, PBM,
                     PGM, PNG, PPM, PhotoShop PSD, Sun RAS, TARGA, TIFF, WBMP, XBM, XPM.

              <b>Color</b> <b>types</b>
                     PosteRazor can handle the  following  image  color  types:  Monochrome,  Grayscale,  4  Bit
                     palette,  8  Bit palette, 24 Bit RGB, 48 Bit RGB (only via TIFF and PNG), 32 Bit CMYK (only
                     via TIFF) 32 Bit RGBA images can be loaded, but are transformed to 24 Bit RGB by  "merging"
                     them with a white background.

              <b>Dimension</b> <b>units</b>
                     Because  people  around  the  world  invented so many different dimension units, PosteRazor
                     supports quite a few: m, mm, cm, inch, ft, <b>pt</b>(72th inch).

              <b>Printer</b> <b>page</b> <b>layout</b>
                     The page size and orientation of the printer where the poster will be printed  can  be  set
                     manually  or  selected  one  from the following list of predefined formats: DIN A4, DIN A3,
                     Legal, Letter or Tabloid.  The size limit for one page is 5 meters (16.4  feet),  which  is
                     the maximum that PDF allows.

              <b>Poster</b> <b>size</b>
                     The size of the final poster can be set through one of these three ways:

                     <b>-</b> <b>Absolute</b> <b>image</b> <b>size</b>
                            You want to have a specific size of your poster.

                     <b>-</b> <b>Size</b> <b>in</b> <b>Pages</b>
                            You  want to use whole paper sheets and specify how many of them of them you want to
                            use.

                     <b>-</b> <b>Image</b> <b>Size</b> <b>in</b> <b>percent</b>
                            Your input image has a certain size which is defined by the number of pixels and dpi
                            (dots per inch) and your want to scale the image by a certain factor.

                     The final size of the poster is theoretically unlimited. Let's say it this way: it is  less
                     limited  that the ink of your printer.  It is possible to select the alignment of the image
                     on the total paper. This is useful if you want to keep the unused paper.

              <b>Image</b> <b>tile</b> <b>overlapping</b>
                     For a bigger tolerance when  cutting  spare  paper  borders  and  for  easier  pasting,  an
                     overlapping width and height of an image tile over the next can be set.

              <b>PDF</b> <b>output</b>
                     The  PDF  output  is  implemented  with the maximum image quality and a good compression in
                     mind.  A source image is embedded once in the PDF document and referenced from  every  tile
                     page.  Image  color  types  remain  unchanged.  As compression method, the PDF "FlateDecode
                     filter" (zip) is used. If a JPEG image is used as input it gets directly embedded into  the
                     document without recompression.  The PDF version is 1.4, so any compatible reader should be
                     able to read the resulting document.

       Missing Support:

              •  Cut lines/aids;

              •  Support of JPEG-CMYK images;

              •  Support of 16 Bit Grayscale images;

              •  Embedding an ICC profile into the PDF if there is one embedded in the input image.
