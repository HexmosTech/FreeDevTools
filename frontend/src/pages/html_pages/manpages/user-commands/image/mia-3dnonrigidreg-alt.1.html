       mia-3dnonrigidreg-alt - Non-linear registration of 3D images.

       <b>mia-3dnonrigidreg-alt</b> <b>-o</b> <b>&lt;out-transform&gt;</b> <b>[options]</b> <b>&lt;PLUGINS:3dimage/fullcost&gt;</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mia-3dnonrigidreg-alt</b>  This  program runs a non-rigid registration based on the given cost criteria and a
       given transformation model. Other  than  mia-3dnonrigidreg  it  doesn't  support  specific  command  line
       parameters  to  provide  the  images.  Instead  the  images  are specified dirctly when defining the cost
       function. Hence, image registrations can be executed that optimize the aligmnet of  more than  one  image
       pair at the same time. Note, however, that all input images must be of the same dimension (in pixels)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Register  image  test.v to image ref.v by using a spline transformation with a coefficient rate of 5  and
       write the registered image to reg.v. Use two multiresolution levels,  ssd  as  image  cost  function  and
       divcurl  weighted  by 10.0 as transformation smoothness penalty. The resulting transformation is saved in
       reg.vf.
