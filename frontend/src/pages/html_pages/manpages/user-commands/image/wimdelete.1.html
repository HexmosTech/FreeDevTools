       wimdelete - Delete an image from a WIM archive

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wimdelete</b> <u>WIMFILE</u> <u>IMAGE</u> [<u>OPTION</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wimdelete</b>,  or  equivalently  <b>wimlib-imagex</b>  <b>delete</b>, deletes the specified image from the Windows Imaging
       (WIM) archive <u>WIMFILE</u>.

       <u>IMAGE</u> specifies the WIM image in <u>WIMFILE</u> to delete.  It may be the 1-based index of an image, the name of
       an image, or the keyword "all" to specify all  images.   You  can  use  <b><a href="../man1/wiminfo.1.html">wiminfo</a></b>(1)  to  list  the  images
       contained in <u>WIMFILE</u>.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       By  default,  <b>wimdelete</b>  rebuilds the WIM with all unnecessary file data removed.  This is different from
       Microsoft's ImageX and DISM, which only will delete the directory tree metadata and  XML  data  for  this
       operation.  Use <b>--soft</b> if you want the other kind of delete.

       wimlib  allows you to delete all the images from a WIM and have a WIM with 0 images, although such a file
       may not be very useful.

       <b>wimdelete</b> does not support split WIMs.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--check</b>
             Before deleting the image, verify the WIM's integrity if extra integrity  information  is  present.
             In  addition,  include  extra integrity information in the modified WIM, even if it was not present
             before.

       <b>--include-integrity</b>
             Include extra integrity information in the modified  WIM,  i.e.  like  <b>--check</b>  but  don't  do  any
             verification beforehand.

       <b>--soft</b>
             Perform  a  "soft  delete".   Specifying this flag overrides the default behavior of rebuilding the
             entire WIM after deleting an image.  Instead, only minimal changes to correctly  remove  the  image
             from the WIM will be taken.  In particular, all file resources will be left alone, even if they are
             no longer referenced.  This may not be what you want, because no space will be saved by deleting an
             image  in  this  way.   However,  <b>wimoptimize</b>  can later be used to rebuild a WIM file that has had
             images soft-deleted from it.

       <b>--unsafe-compact</b>
             Compact the WIM archive in-place, eliminating "holes".  This is  efficient,  but  in  general  this
             option  should <u>not</u> be used because a failed or interrupted compaction will corrupt the WIM archive.
             For more information, see the documentation for this option to <b><a href="../man1/wimoptimize.1.html">wimoptimize</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Delete the first image from 'boot.wim':

              wimdelete boot.wim 1
