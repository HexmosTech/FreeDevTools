</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       feh — image viewer and cataloguer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>feh</b> [<u>options</u>] [<b>--</b>] [<u>files</u> | <u>directories</u> | <u>URLs</u> <u>...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual documents <b>feh</b> 3.10.3

       Compile-time switches in this build:
       <b>•</b>   libcurl remote file support enabled
       <b>•</b>   Xinerama multi-monitor support enabled
       <b>•</b>   libexif builtin EXIF reader available
       <b>•</b>   inotify-based auto-reload of changed files enabled
       <b>•</b>   libmagic disabled

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>feh</b>  is  a light-weight, configurable and versatile image viewer.  It is aimed at command line users, but
       can also be started from graphical file managers.  Apart from viewing images, it  can  compile  text  and
       thumbnail listings, show (un)loadable files, set X11 backgrounds, and more.

       Features  include filelists, various image sorting modes, custom action scripts, and image captions.  <b>feh</b>
       can be controlled by configurable keyboard and mouse shortcuts, terminal input and signals.  When no file
       arguments or filelists are specified and <b>--start-at</b> is not used, <b>feh</b> displays all files  in  the  current
       directory.

       EXIF  tags  are supported either using exiv2 / exifgrep via <b>--info</b> (see the “USAGE EXAMPLES section”), or
       as a builtin feature by compiling <b>feh</b> with exif=1.  In  this  build  of  <b>feh</b>,  builtin  EXIF  support  is
       available.

</pre><h4><b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>feh</b> is based on various modes, which are selected at startup by command line options.

       Slideshow  mode  is  the  default.   It  opens a window and displays the first image in it; the slideshow
       position can be advanced (or otherwise changed) using keyboard and mouse shortcuts.  In  slideshow  mode,
       images  can be deleted either from the filelist or from the disk, a changed filelist can also be saved to
       the disk and reopened at a later time.  An image can also be read from stdin via "feh -".

       Montage mode forms a montage from the filelist.  The resulting image can be viewed or saved, and its size
       can be limited by height, width or both.

       Index mode forms an index print from the filelist.  Image thumbnails are shown along with  the  filename,
       size  and dimensions, printed using a truetype font of your choice.  The resulting image can be viewed or
       saved, and its size can be limited by height, width or both.

       Thumbnail mode is like index mode, but the mini-images are clickable and open the selected image in a new
       window.

       Multiwindow mode shows images in multiple windows, instead of as a slideshow in one  window.   Don't  use
       with a large filelist ;)

       List  mode doesn't display images.  Instead, it outputs an <b>ls</b>-style listing of the files in the filelist,
       including image info such as size, number of pixels, type, etc.  There is also a  Customlist  mode  which
       prints image info in a custom format specified by a printf-like format string.

       <b>feh</b>  can  also  list  either  all  the loadable files in a filelist or all the unloadable files.  This is
       useful for preening a directory.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>feh</b> can open any format supported by imlib2, most notably jpeg, png, pnm, tiff, and bmp.  The gif  format
       is  also  supported,  but  only  for  static images.  In case of animations, only the first frame will be
       shown.

       When invoked with <b>--conversion-timeout</b> <u>timeout</u> (and a non-negative <u>timeout</u> value), <b>feh</b> also  has  limited
       support  for  various  other file types by means of external conversion programs.  If the dcraw binary is
       available, <b>feh</b> will use it to display the thumbnails embedded into RAW files provided by digital  cameras
       and  similar.  If the ImageMagick convert binary is available, <b>feh</b> will use it to load file types such as
       svg, xcf, and otf.

       (optional feature, disabled in this build) <b>feh</b> can use libmagic to only pass image files to Imlib2.  When
       using <b>feh</b> with lots of non-image files (especially with Imlib2 version 1.6.x or 1.7.0), this can speed up
       the detection of non-image files significantly.  If you think that Imlib2 can load a file which  <b>feh</b>  has
       determined  to  be  likely  not an image, set the environment variable "FEH_SKIP_MAGIC" to pass all files
       directly to Imlib2, bypassing this check.  The environment variable's value  does  not  matter,  it  just
       needs to be set.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-A</b>, <b>--action</b> [<u>flag</u>][[<u>title</u>]]<u>action</u>
               Specify  a shell command as an action to perform on the image.  In slideshow or multiwindow mode,
               the action will be run when the action_0 key is pressed, in list mode, it will be  run  for  each
               file.    In  loadable/unloadable  mode,  it  will  be  run  for  each  loadable/unloadable  file,
               respectively.  In thumbnail mode, clicking on an image will cause the action to  run  instead  of
               opening the image.

               If <u>flag</u> is ";", <b>feh</b> will reload the current image instead of switching to the next one (slideshow
               mode)  or  closing  the  window  (multiwindow  mode)  after  executing the action.  If [<u>title</u>] is
               specified (note the literal "[" and "]"), <b>--draw-actions</b> will display <u>title</u> instead of <u>action</u>  in
               the action list.  Note that <u>title</u> must not start with a space.  If it does, the action is handled
               as  if it did not have a title.  This special case exists for backwards compatibility reasons and
               makes sure that actions like "[ -L %F ] &amp;&amp; foo" still work.

               The action will be executed by /bin/sh.  Use format  specifiers  to  refer  to  image  info,  see
               “FORMAT SPECIFIERS” for details.  Example usage: "feh -A "mv %F <a href="file:~/images/">~/images/</a>%N" *".

       <b>--action1</b> .. <b>--action9</b> [<u>flag</u>][[<u>title</u>]]<u>action</u>
               Extra actions which can be set and triggered using the appropriate number key.

       <b>--auto-reload</b>
               (optional  feature,  enabled  in  this build) automatically reload image when the underlying file
               changes.  Note that auto-reload (if enabled in the build) is on by default.  This option is  only
               useful to re-enable auto-reload after it has been disabled by a preceding <b>--reload=0</b> option.

               Automatic reload is not supported in montage, index, or thumbnail mode.

       <b>--auto-rotate</b>
               (optional  feature,  available  in  this build) (deprecated in favor of Imlib2's auto-orientation
               support) Automatically rotate images based on EXIF data.  Does not alter the image files.

               Note that Imlib2 version 1.7.5+ performs auto-rotation by itself, so this option is  obsolete  on
               systems with Imlib2 version 1.7.5 or later.  <b>feh</b> currently cannot detect this at runtime.

       <b>-Z</b>, <b>--auto-zoom</b>
               Zoom pictures to screen size in fullscreen / fixed geometry mode.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--borderless</b>
               Create borderless windows.

       <b>--cache-size</b> <u>size</u>
               Set  imlib2  in-memory  cache  to  <u>size</u>  MiB.   A  higher  cache  size  can significantly improve
               performance  especially  for  small  slide  shows,  however  at  the  cost  of  increased  memory
               consumption.  <u>size</u> must be between 0 and 2048 MiB and defaults to 4.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--cache-thumbnails</b>
               Enable  thumbnail caching.  Thumbnails are saved in <u>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/thumbnails</u>, which defaults to
               <u><a href="file:~/.cache/thumbnails">~/.cache/thumbnails</a></u>.  Note that thumbnails are only cached if the configured thumbnail size  does
               not exceed 256x256 pixels.

       <b>-K</b>, <b>--caption-path</b> <u>path</u>
               Path  to directory containing image captions.  This turns on caption viewing, and if captions are
               found in <u>path</u>, which is relative to the directory of  each  image,  they  are  overlayed  on  the
               displayed  image.   E.g.  with  caption path "captions/", and viewing image "images/foo.jpg", the
               caption will be looked for in "images/captions/foo.jpg.txt".

       <b>--conversion-timeout</b> <u>timeout</u>
               <b>feh</b> can use ImageMagick to try converting unloadable files into a supported file format.  As this
               can take a long time, it is disabled by default.  Set <u>timeout</u> to a non-negative value  to  enable
               it.   A  positive  value  specifies after how many seconds conversion attempts should be aborted,
               zero causes <b>feh</b> to try indefinitely.  Negative values restore the default by disabling conversion
               altogether.

       <b>--class</b> <u>class</u>
               Set the X11 class hint to <u>class</u>.  Default: feh

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--customlist</b> <u>format</u>
               Don't display images, print image info according to <u>format</u> instead.  See “FORMAT SPECIFIERS”.

       <b>-G</b>, <b>--draw-actions</b>
               Draw the defined actions and what they do at the top-left of the image.

       <b>--draw-exif</b>
               (optional feature, available in this build) display some EXIF  information  in  the  bottom  left
               corner, similar to using <b>--info</b> with exiv2 / exifgrep.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--draw-filename</b>
               Draw the file name at the top-left of the image.

       <b>--draw-tinted</b>
               Show  overlay  texts  (as  created  by <b>--draw-filename</b> et al) on a semi-transparent background to
               improve their readability.

       <b>--edit</b>  Enable basic editing of files.  This makes rotation and mirroring (bound to "&lt;",  "&gt;",  "|",  and
               "_" by default) change the underlying file and not just its displayed content.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--filelist</b> <u>file</u>
               This  option is similar to the playlists used by music software.  If <u>file</u> exists, it will be read
               for a list of files to load, in the order they appear.  The format is a list of image file names,
               absolute or relative to the current directory, one file name per line.

               If <u>file</u> doesn't exist, it will be created from the internal filelist at  the  end  of  a  viewing
               session.   This  is  best  used  to store the results of complex sorts (<b>-Spixels</b> for example) for
               later viewing.

               Any changes to the internal filelist (such as deleting a  file  or  it  being  pruned  for  being
               unloadable)  will  be saved to <u>file</u> when <b>feh</b> exits.  You can add files to filelists by specifying
               them on the command line when also specifying the list.

               If <u>file</u> is "-", <b>feh</b> will read the filelist from its standard input.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--font</b> <u>font</u>
               Set global font.  Should be a truetype font, resident  in  the  current  directory  or  the  font
               directory,  and  should  be  defined  in  the  form  fontname/size, like "yudit/12" (which is the
               default).

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--fontpath</b> <u>path</u>
               Specify <u>path</u> as extra directory in which to search for fonts; can be used multiple times  to  add
               multiple paths.

       <b>--force-aliasing</b>
               Disable anti-aliasing for zooming, background setting etc.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--fullindex</b>
               Same  as  index mode, but with additional information below the thumbnails.  Works just like "feh
               --index --index-info "%n\n%S\n%wx%h"".  Enables “MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS”.

               Note: This option needs to load all images to calculate the dimensions of the <b>feh</b> window, so when
               using it with many files it will take a while before a <b>feh</b> window is visible.  Use  <b>--preload</b>  to
               get a progress bar.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--fullscreen</b>
               Make  the  window fullscreen.  Note that in this mode, large images will always be scaled down to
               fit the screen, and <b>--zoom</b> <u>zoom</u>  only  affects  smaller  images  and  never  scales  larger  than
               necessary to fit the screen size.  The only exception is a <u>zoom</u> of 100, in which case images will
               always be shown at 100% zoom.

               When  combined  with  <b>--thumbnails</b>,  this  option  only  affects images opened from the thumbnail
               overview.  The thumbnail list itself will still be windowed.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--geometry</b> <u>width</u> <b>x</b> <u>height</u> | <b>+</b> <u>x</u> <b>+</b> <u>y</u> | <u>width</u> <b>x</b> <u>height</u> <b>+</b> <u>x</u> <b>+</b> <u>y</u>
               Use a fixed window size as specified in the X-style geometry <u>string</u>, e.g. 640x480.   An  optional
               +x+y  window offset can be specified.  Combine with <b>--scale-down</b> to scale down larger images like
               in fullscreen mode.  Note that this option does not enforce the window size;  changing  it  by  a
               tiling WM or manually is still possible.  However, auto-resize remains disabled.

       <b>-Y</b>, <b>--hide-pointer</b>
               Hide the pointer (useful for slideshows).

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--image-bg</b> <u>style</u>
               Use  <u>style</u>  as  background  for  transparent image parts and the like.  Accepted values: default,
               checks, or an XColor (e.g. "black" or "#428bdd").  Note that some shells treat the hash symbol as
               a special character, so you may need to quote or escape it for  the  XColor  code  to  work.   In
               windowed  mode, the default is checks (a checkered background so transparent image parts are easy
               to see).  In fullscreen and background setting mode, <b>checks</b> is not accepted and  the  default  is
               black.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--index</b>
               Enable  Index  mode.   Index  mode  is similar to montage mode, and accepts the same options.  It
               creates an index print of thumbnails, printing the image name beneath each thumbnail.  Index mode
               enables certain other options, see “INDEX AND THUMBNAIL MODE OPTIONS” and “MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS”.

       <b>--info</b> [<u>flag</u>]<u>command_line</u>
               Execute <u>command_line</u> and display its output in the bottom left corner of the image.  Can be  used
               to  display e.g. image dimensions or EXIF information.  Supports “FORMAT SPECIFIERS”.  If <u>flag</u> is
               set to ";", the output will not be displayed by default, but has to be enabled by the toggle_info
               key.

       <b>--insecure</b>
               When viewing files with HTTPS, this option disables all certificate checks.  It allows images  on
               sites  with  self-signed  or  expired certificates to be opened, but is no more secure than plain
               HTTP.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keep-http</b>
               When viewing files using HTTP, <b>feh</b> normally deletes  the  local  copies  after  viewing,  or,  if
               caching, on exit.  This option permanently stores them on disk, either in the directory specified
               by <b>--output-dir</b>, or in the current working directory.

       <b>--keep-zoom-vp</b>
               When switching images, keep zoom and viewport settings (zoom level and X, Y offsets)

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
               Don't  display  images.  Analyze them and display an <u><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></u>(1) - style listing.  Useful in scripts to
               hunt out images of a certain size/resolution/type etc.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--loadable</b>
               Don't display images.  Just print out their names if imlib2 can successfully load them.   Returns
               false  if  at  least one image failed to load.  When combined with <b>--action</b>, the specified action
               will be run for each loadable image.

       <b>--max-dimension</b> <u>width</u> x <u>height</u>
               Only show images with width &lt;= <u>width</u> and height &lt;= <u>height</u>.  If you only care about one parameter,
               set the other to 0 (or a negative value).

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--menu-font</b> <u>font</u>
               Use <u>font</u> (truetype, with size, like "yudit/12") as menu font.

       <b>--min-dimension</b> <u>width</u> x <u>height</u>
               Only show images with width &gt;= <u>width</u> and height &gt;= <u>height</u>.  If you only care about one parameter,
               set the other to 0.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--montage</b>
               Enable montage mode.  Montage mode creates a new image consisting of a grid of thumbnails of  the
               images  in  the filelist.  When montage mode is selected, certain other options become available.
               See “MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS”.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--multiwindow</b>
               Disable slideshow mode.  With this setting, instead of opening multiple files in slideshow  mode,
               multiple windows will be opened; one per file.

       <b>--no-conversion-cache</b>
               When  loading images via HTTP, ImageMagick or dcraw, <b>feh</b> will only load/convert them once and re-
               use the cached file on subsequent slideshow passes.  This option disables the cache.  It is  also
               disabled  when  <b>--reload</b> is used.  Use it if you rely on frequently changing files loaded via one
               of these sources.  Note that it will impair performance.

       <b>--no-jump-on-resort</b>
               Don't jump to the first image after resorting the filelist.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--no-menus</b>
               Don't load or show any menus.

       <b>--no-screen-clip</b>
               By default, window sizes are limited to the screen size.  With this option, windows will have the
               size of the image inside them.  Note that they may  become  very  large  this  way,  making  them
               unmanageable in certain window managers.

       <b>--no-xinerama</b>
               (optional feature, enabled in this build) Disable Xinerama support.

       <b>--on-last-slide</b> <b>hold</b> | <b>quit</b> | <b>resume</b>
               Select behaviour when trying to select the next image on the last slide (or the previous image on
               the first slide) in a slide show.

               With  <b>hold</b>,  <b>feh</b>  will  stop advancing images in this case and continue displaying the first/last
               image, respectively.  This is intended for linear slide shows.   Behaviour  is  unspecified  when
               using other navigation commands than previous and next image.

               <b>quit</b> will cause <b>feh</b> to quit when trying to advance past the last image in the slide show. This is
               the behavior of the obsolete <b>--cycle-once</b> option.

               <b>resume</b>  is  the  default  behaviour: On the last (first) image, <b>feh</b> will wrap around to the first
               (last) image.

       <b>-j</b>, <b>--output-dir</b> <u>directory</u>
               Save files to <u>directory</u> when using <b>--keep-http</b> or the save_image or  save_filelist  command.   By
               default, files are saved in the current working directory.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--preload</b>
               Preload  images.   This  doesn't  mean  hold them in RAM, it means run through them and eliminate
               unloadable images first.  Otherwise they will  be  removed  as  you  flick  through.   This  also
               analyses  the images to get data for use in sorting, such as pixel size, type etc.  A preload run
               will be automatically performed if you specify one of these sort modes.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
               Don't report non-fatal errors for failed  loads.   Verbose  and  quiet  modes  are  not  mutually
               exclusive, the first controls informational messages, the second only errors.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--randomize</b>
               When  viewing multiple files in a slideshow, randomize the file list before displaying.  The list
               is re-randomized whenever the slideshow cycles (that is, transitions from last to first image).

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
               Recursively expand any directories in  the  command  line  arguments  to  the  content  of  those
               directories, all the way down to the bottom level.

       <b>--no-recursive</b>
               Don't  recursively  expand  any  directories.   This is the default, but this option is useful to
               override themes containing <b>--recursive</b>.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--reload</b> <u>int</u>
               Reload filelist and current image  after  <u>int</u>  seconds.   Useful  for  viewing  HTTP  webcams  or
               frequently  changing  directories.   (Note that filelist reloading is still experimental.) Set to
               zero to disable any kind of automatic reloading.

               If an image is removed, <b>feh</b> will either show the next one or quit.  However, if  an  image  still
               exists, but can no longer be loaded, <b>feh</b> will continue to try loading it.

               Setting  this option causes inotify-based auto-reload to be disabled.  Reload is not supported in
               montage, index, or thumbnail mode.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--reverse</b>
               Reverse the sort order.  Use this to invert the order of the filelist.  E.g. to sort  in  reverse
               width order, use <b>-nSwidth</b>.

       <b>-.</b>, <b>--scale-down</b>
               Scale  images  to  fit  window geometry (defaults to screen size when no geometry was specified).
               Note that the window geometry is not updated when changing images at the moment.  This option  is
               recommended  for tiling window managers.  This option is ignored when in fullscreen and thumbnail
               list mode.

               In tiling environments, this also causes the image to be centered in the window.

       <b>--scroll-step</b> <u>count</u>
               Scroll <u>count</u> pixels whenever scroll_up, scroll_down,  scroll_left  or  scroll_right  is  pressed.
               Note  that this option accepts negative numbers in case you need to reverse the scroll direction.
               See “KEYS CONFIG SYNTAX” for how to reverse it permanently.  Default: 20

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--slideshow-delay</b> <u>float</u>
               For slideshow mode, wait  <u>float</u>  seconds  between  automatically  changing  slides.   Useful  for
               presentations.  Specify a negative number to set the delay (which will then be <u>float</u> * (-1)), but
               start <b>feh</b> in paused mode.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--sort</b> <u>sort_type</u>
               Sort  file  list  according  to  image parameters.  Allowed sort types are: <b>name</b>, <b>none</b>, <b>filename</b>,
               <b>dirname</b>, <b>mtime</b>, <b>width</b>, <b>height</b>, <b>pixels</b>, <b>size</b>, <b>format</b>.  For  sort  modes  other  than  <b>name</b>,  <b>none</b>,
               <b>filename</b>,  <b>dirname</b>,  or  <b>mtime</b>,  a  preload run is necessary, causing a delay proportional to the
               number of images in the list.

               <b>mtime</b> starts with the most recently modified image.  <b>width</b>, <b>height</b>, <b>pixels</b> and  <b>size</b>  start  with
               the smallest.  Use <b>--reverse</b> to sort by oldest or largest first.

               For  <b>name</b>,  <b>filename</b>,  and  <b>dirname</b> you can use <b>--version-sort</b> to sort numbers naturally, so that
               e.g. 10.jpg comes after 2.jpg.

               <b>none</b> is the default; you can specify it explicitly to discard a sort mode that has been specified
               at an earlier point in the command line arguments.

       <b>-|</b>, <b>--start-at</b> <u>filename</u>
               Start the filelist at <u>filename</u>.  If no other files or filelists were  specified  on  the  command
               line, <b>feh</b> will first load all files from the directory in which <u>filename</u> resides.  This way, it's
               possible  to  look  at  a  specific  image  and  use  the  next / prev keys to browse through the
               directory.  See “USAGE EXAMPLES” for examples.  If <u>filename</u> is a  remote  URL  and  no  files  or
               filelists  were  specified,  <b>feh</b>  will  show <u>filename</u> and not attempt to load additional files or
               directories.

               Note: If you use relative paths in your filelist, <u>filename</u> should also be a  relative  path.   If
               you  use  absolute paths, it should also be an absolute path.  If <b>feh</b> cannot find an exact match,
               it will compare basenames (filenames without the directory suffix).  This may lead to  mismatches
               if several files in your filelist have the same basename.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--theme</b> <u>theme</u>
               Load  options  from config file with name <u>theme</u> - see “THEMES CONFIG SYNTAX” for more info.  Note
               that command line options always override theme options.  The theme  can  also  be  set  via  the
               program name (e.g. with symlinks), so by default <b>feh</b> will look for a "<b>feh</b>" theme.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--thumbnails</b>
               Same as Index mode, but the thumbnails are clickable image launchers.  Note that <b>--fullscreen</b> and
               <b>--scale-down</b>  do  not  affect  the  thumbnail  window.   They do, however, work for image windows
               launched from thumbnail mode.  Also supports “INDEX  AND  THUMBNAIL  MODE  OPTIONS”  as  well  as
               “MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS”.

       <b>-~</b>, <b>--thumb-title</b> <u>string</u>
               Set <u>title</u> for windows opened from thumbnail mode.  See also “FORMAT SPECIFIERS”.

       <b>-^</b>, <b>--title</b> <u>title</u>
               Set  window  title.  Applies to all windows except those opened from thumbnail mode.  See “FORMAT
               SPECIFIERS”.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--unloadable</b>
               Don't display images.  Just print out their names if  imlib2  can  NOT  successfully  load  them.
               Returns  false  if  at  least one image was loadable.  When combined with <b>--action</b>, the specified
               action will be run for each unloadable file.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
               output useful information, progress bars, etc.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
               output version information and exit.

       <b>--version-sort</b>
               When combined with <b>--sort</b> <b>name</b>, <b>--sort</b> <b>filename</b>, or <b>--sort</b> <b>dirname</b>: use natural sorting for  file
               and  directory names.  In this mode, filenames are sorted as an ordinary human would expect, e.g.
               "2.jpg" comes before "10.jpg".  Note that this option only has an effect when a sort mode is  set
               using <b>--sort</b>.

       <b>--window-id</b> <u>windowid</u>
               Draw to an existing X11 window by its ID <u>windowid</u>.  This option is intended for use with software
               such  as  xcreensaver or xsecurelock, which provide a window for other applications to draw into.
               Unexpected things will happen if you specify a window belonging to software which does not expect
               <b>feh</b> to draw into it or attempt to use options or keybindings which affect window attributes, such
               as full-screen mode.

       <b>--xinerama-index</b> <u>monitor</u>
               (optional feature, enabled in this build) Override <b>feh</b>'s idea of  the  active  Xinerama  monitor.
               May be useful in certain circumstances where the window manager places the feh window on Xinerama
               monitor A while <b>feh</b> assumes that it will be placed on monitor B.

               In background setting mode: When used with any option other than <b>--bg-tile</b>: Only set wallpaper on
               <u>monitor</u>.   All  other  monitors  will  be  filled black/white.  This is most useful in a Xinerama
               configuration with overlapping monitors.  For instance, assume you have two overlapping  displays
               (index  0  and  1), where index 0 is smaller.  To center a background on the display with index 0
               and fill the extra space on index 1  black/white,  use  "--xinerama-index  0"  when  setting  the
               wallpaper.

               Use  <b>xrandr</b>  <b>--listmonitors</b> to determine how Xinerama monitor IDs map to screens/monitors in your
               setup.

       <b>--zoom</b> <u>percent</u> | <b>max</b> | <b>fill</b>
               Zoom images by <u>percent</u> when in full screen mode or when window geometry is fixed.  When  combined
               with  <b>--auto-zoom</b>,  zooming  will  be  limited  to the specified <u>percent</u>.  Specifying <b>max</b> is like
               setting <b>--auto-zoom</b>, using <b>fill</b> makes <b>feh</b> zoom the image like the <b>--bg-fill</b> mode.

       <b>--zoom-step</b> <u>percent</u>
               Zoom images in and out by <u>percent</u> (default: 25) when using the zoom keys and buttons.

</pre><h4><b>MONTAGE</b> <b>MODE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These additional options can be used for index, montage and (partially) thumbnail mode.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--alpha</b> <u>int</u>
               When drawing thumbnails onto the background, set their transparency level to <u>int</u> (0 - 255).

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--bg</b> <u>file</u> | <b>trans</b>
               Use <u>file</u> as background for your montage.  With this  option  specified,  the  montage  size  will
               default  to  the  size of <u>file</u> if no size restrictions were specified.  Alternatively, if <u>file</u> is
               "trans", the background will be made transparent.

       <b>-X</b>, <b>--ignore-aspect</b>
               By default, the montage thumbnails will retain their aspect ratios,  while  fitting  into  thumb-
               width/-height.   This options forces them to be the size set by <b>--thumb-width</b> and <b>--thumb-height</b>.
               This will prevent any empty space in the final montage.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--limit-height</b> <u>pixels</u>
               Limit the height of the montage.

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--limit-width</b> <u>pixels</u>
               Limit the width of the montage, defaults to 800 pixels.

               If both <b>--limit-width</b> and <b>--limit-height</b> are specified, the  montage  will  be  exactly  <u>width</u>  x
               <u>height</u> pixels in dimensions.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output</b> <u>file</u>
               Save the created montage to <u>file</u>.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--output-only</b> <u>file</u>
               Just save the created montage to <u>file</u> without displaying it.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--stretch</b>
               Normally,  if an image is smaller than the specified thumbnail size, it will not be enlarged.  If
               this option is set, the image will be scaled up to fit the thumbnail size.  Aspect ratio will  be
               maintained unless <b>--ignore-aspect</b> is specified.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--thumb-height</b> <u>pixels</u>
               Set thumbnail height.

       <b>-y</b>, <b>--thumb-width</b> <u>pixels</u>
               Set thumbnail width.

</pre><h4><b>INDEX</b> <b>AND</b> <b>THUMBNAIL</b> <b>MODE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In   addition   to  “MONTAGE  MODE  OPTIONS”  <b>--alpha</b>,  <b>--bg</b>,  <b>--limit-height</b>,  <b>--limit-width</b>,  <b>--output</b>,
       <b>--output-only</b>, <b>--thumb-height</b>, <b>--thumb-width</b>, the following options can be used.

       <b>--index-info</b> <u>format</u>
               Show image information based on <u>format</u> below thumbnails in index / thumbnail mode.   See  “FORMAT
               SPECIFIERS”.  May contain newlines.  Use "--index-info ''" to display thumbnails without any info
               text

               Note:  If  you  specify image-related formats (such as %w or %s), <b>feh</b> needs to load all images to
               calculate the dimensions of its own window.  So when using them with many files, it will  take  a
               while before a <b>feh</b> window becomes visible.  Use <b>--preload</b> to get a progress bar.

       <b>-@</b>, <b>--title-font</b> <u>font</u>
               Set font to print a title on the index, if no font is specified, no title will be printed.

       <b>-J</b>, <b>--thumb-redraw</b> <u>n</u>
               Redraw  thumbnail window every <u>n</u> images while generating thumbnails.  Redrawing takes quite long,
               so the default is 10.  Set <u>n</u> = 1 to update the thumbnail window immediately.  With <u>n</u> =  0,  there
               will only be one redraw once all thumbnails are loaded.

</pre><h4><b>BACKGROUND</b> <b>SETTING</b></h4><pre>
       In  many  desktop  environments,  <b>feh</b>  can  also  be  used  as  a background setter.  Unless you pass the
       <b>--no-fehbg</b> option, it will write a script to set the current background to <u><a href="file:~/.fehbg">~/.fehbg</a></u>.   So  to  have  your
       background  restored  every  time you start X, you can add "<a href="file:~/.fehbg">~/.fehbg</a> &amp;" to your X startup script (such as
       <u><a href="file:~/.xinitrc">~/.xinitrc</a></u>).  Note that the commandline written to <u><a href="file:~/.fehbg">~/.fehbg</a></u> always  includes  the  <b>--no-fehbg</b>  option  to
       ensure that it is not inadvertently changed by differences in X11 screen layout or similar.

       Note  that  <b>feh</b> does not support setting the wallpaper of GNOME shell desktops.  In this environment, you
       can use "gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///<u>path</u>" instead.

       For <b>--bg-center</b>, <b>--bg-fill</b>, and <b>--bg-max</b>, you can use <b>--geometry</b> to specify an offset from  one  side  of
       the monitor instead of centering the image.  Positive values will offset from the left/top side, negative
       values from the bottom/right.  +0 and -0 are both valid and distinct values.

       Note  that  all  options  except <b>--bg-tile</b> support Xinerama.  For instance, if you have multiple monitors
       connected and use e.g.  <b>--bg-center</b>, <b>feh</b> will center or appropriately offset the image on  each  monitor.
       You  may even specify more than one file, in that case, the first file is set on monitor 0, the second on
       monitor 1, and so on.  Use <b>xrandr</b> <b>--listmonitors</b> to determine how Xinerama monitor IDs map to  screens  /
       monitors in your setup.

       Use  <b>--no-xinerama</b> to treat the whole X display as one monitor when setting wallpapers.  You may also use
       <b>--xinerama-index</b> to use <b>feh</b> as a background setter for a specific monitor.

       <b>--bg-center</b>
               Center the file on the background.  If it is too small, it will be  surrounded  by  a  border  as
               specified by <b>--image-bg</b>.

       <b>--bg-fill</b>
               Like  <b>--bg-scale</b>,  but  preserves  aspect  ratio  by  zooming  the image until it fits.  Either a
               horizontal or a vertical part of the image will be cut off

       <b>--bg-max</b>
               Like <b>--bg-fill</b>, but scale the image to the maximum size that fits the screen with borders on  one
               side.  The border color can be set using <b>--image-bg</b>.

       <b>--bg-scale</b>
               Fit  the  file into the background without repeating it, cutting off stuff or using borders.  But
               the aspect ratio is not preserved either

       <b>--bg-tile</b>
               Tile (repeat) the image in case it is too small for the screen

       <b>--no-fehbg</b>
               Do not write a <u><a href="file:~/.fehbg">~/.fehbg</a></u> file

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b> <b>SPECIFIERS</b></h4><pre>
       %a      Information about slideshow state (playing/paused)

       %Z      Current image zoom, higher precision

       %%      A literal %

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>feh</b>  has  three  config  files: <u>themes</u> for theme definitions, <u>keys</u> for key bindings and <u>buttons</u> for mouse
       button bindings.  It will try to read them from <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/feh/</u>,  which  (when  XDG_CONFIG_HOME  is
       unset)  defaults  to  <u><a href="file:~/.config/feh/">~/.config/feh/</a></u>.   If  the  files  are not found in that directory, it will also try
       <u>/etc/feh/</u>.

       All config files treat lines starting with a "#" character as comments.  Comments at the end  of  a  line
       are not supported.

</pre><h4><b>THEMES</b> <b>CONFIG</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <u>.config/feh/themes</u> allows the naming of option groups, called themes.

       It  takes  entries  of the form "<u>theme</u> <u>options</u> <u>...</u>", where <u>theme</u> is the name of the entry and <u>options</u> are
       the options which will be applied when the theme is used.

       Note that the option parser does not behave like a normal shell: filename expansion and backslash  escape
       sequences  are  not  supported and passed to feh's option parser as-is.  However, quoting of arguments is
       respected and can be used for arguments with whitespace.  So, the sequence "--info "foo  bar""  works  as
       intended  (that  is,  it  display the string "foo bar"), whereas the option string "--info foo\ bar" will
       only display "foo\" and complain about the file bar not existing.  Please keep this in mind when  writing
       theme files.

       An example entry is "imagemap -rVq --thumb-width 40 --thumb-height 30 --index-info '%n\n%wx%h'".

       You can use this theme in two ways.  Either call "<b>feh</b> -Timagemap *.jpg", or create a symbolic link to <b>feh</b>
       with  the name of the theme you want it to use.  For the example above, this would be "ln -s `which <b>feh</b> `
       <a href="file:~/bin/imagemap">~/bin/imagemap</a>".  Now just run "imagemap *.jpg" to use these options.

       Note that you can split a theme over several lines by placing a backslash at the  end  of  an  unfinished
       line.  A single option-argument-pair must not span multiple lines.  A single line must not be longer than
       1023 characters, but there's no upper limit for the length of a theme.

       Command line options always override theme options.

</pre><h4><b>KEYS</b> <b>CONFIG</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <u>.config/feh/keys</u> defines key bindings.  It has entries of the form "<u>action</u> [<u>key1</u> [<u>key2</u> [<u>key3</u>]]]".

       Each <u>key</u> is an X11 keysym name as shown by <u><a href="../man1/xev.1.html">xev</a></u>(1), like "Delete".  It may optionally start with modifiers
       for  things like Control, in which case <u>key</u> looks like <u>mod</u>-<u>keysym</u> (for example "C-Delete" for Ctrl+Delete
       or "C-1-Delete" for Ctrl+Alt+Delete)

       Available modifiers are <u>C</u> for Control, <u>S</u> for Shift and <u>1</u>, <u>4</u> for Mod1 and Mod4.   To  match  an  uppercase
       letter like "S" instead of "s", the Shift modifier is not required.

       Specifying an <u>action</u> without any keys unbinds it (i.e. the default bindings are removed).

       <u>Note:</u> Do not use the same keybinding for multiple actions.  When binding an action to a new key (or mouse
       button), make sure to unbind it from its previous action, if present.  <b>feh</b> does not check for conflicting
       bindings, so their behaviour is undefined.

       For  a list of the <u>action</u> names, see “KEYS”.  Note that not all of the key names used there correspond to
       X11 keysyms.  Most notably, page up (Prior / Page_Up), page down (Next / Page_Down) and the  keypad  keys
       (KP_*) do not.

</pre><h4><b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  actions and default key bindings can be used in an image window.  (The strings in [square
       brackets] are the config action names).  If <b>feh</b> is running inside a terminal and its  standard  input  is
       not  used for images or filelists, key input from the terminal is also accepted.  However, terminal input
       support is currently limited to most alphanumeric characters (0-9 a-z A-Z and  some  more),  arrow  keys,
       return and backspace.  The Alt (Mod1) modifier is also supported.

       a [toggle_actions]
               Toggle actions display (see <b>--draw-actions</b>)

       A [toggle_aliasing]
               Enable/Disable anti-aliasing

       c [toggle_caption]
               Caption  entry  mode.   If  <b>--caption-path</b> has been specified, then this enables caption editing.
               The caption at the bottom of the screen will turn yellow  and  can  be  edited.   Hit  return  to
               confirm  and  save  the caption, or escape to cancel editing.  Note that you can insert an actual
               newline into the caption using ⟨Ctrl+return⟩.

       d [toggle_filenames]
               Toggle filename display (see <b>--draw-filename</b>)

       e [toggle_exif]
               (optional feature, available in this build) Toggle EXIF tag display

       f [toggle_fullscreen]
               Toggle fullscreen

       g [toggle_fixed_geometry]
               Enable/Disable automatic window resize when changing images.

       h [toggle_pause]
               Pause/Continue the slideshow.  When it is paused, it will not automatically change  slides  based
               on <b>--slideshow-delay</b>.

       i [toggle_info]
               Toggle info display (see <b>--info</b>)

       k [toggle_keep_vp]
               Toggle  zoom  and  viewport  keeping.   When  enabled,  <b>feh</b>  will  keep zoom and X, Y offset when
               switching images.

       L [save_filelist]
               Save the current filelist as "feh_PID_ID_filelist".  It is saved in the  directory  specified  by
               <b>--output-dir</b>, if set, and in the current working directory otherwise.

       m [toggle_menu]
               Show menu.  Use the arrow keys and return to select items, and ⟨escape⟩ to close the menu.

       n, ⟨space⟩, ⟨Right⟩ [next_img]
               Show next image.  Selects the next image in thumbnail mode.

       o [toggle_pointer]
               Toggle pointer visibility

       p, ⟨BackSpace⟩, ⟨Left⟩ [prev_img]

       q, ⟨Escape⟩ [quit]
               Quit <b>feh</b>

       r [reload_image]
               Reload current image.  Useful for webcams

       s [save_image]
               Save  the  current  image  as  "feh_PID_ID_FILENAME".   It is saved in the directory specified by
               <b>--output-dir</b>, if set, and in the current working directory otherwise.

       w [size_to_image]
               Change window size to fit current image size (plus/minus zoom, if set).  In scale-down and fixed-
               geometry mode, this also updates the window size limits.

       x [close]
               Close current window

       z [jump_random]
               Jump to a random position in the current filelist

       Z [toggle_auto_zoom]
               Toggle auto-zoom.

       [, ] [prev_dir, next_dir]
               Jump to the first image of the previous or next sequence of images sharing a  directory  name  in
               the  current  filelist.   Use  --sort  dirname  if  you would like to ensure that all images in a
               directory are grouped together.

       &lt;, &gt; [orient_3, orient_1]
               rotate the image 90 degrees (counter)clockwise.

               When <b>--edit</b> is used, this also rotates the image in the underlying file.  Rotation  is  lossless,
               but  may  create  artifacts  in  some  image corners when used with JPEG images.  Rotating in the
               reverse direction will make them go away.  See <u><a href="../man1/jpegtran.1.html">jpegtran</a></u>(1) for more about lossless JPEG rotation.
               <u>Note:</u> <b>feh</b> assumes that this feature is used to normalize image orientation.  For JPEG images,  it
               will  unconditionally set the EXIF orientation tag to 1 ("0,0 is top left") after every rotation.
               See <u><a href="../man1/jpegexiforient.1.html">jpegexiforient</a></u>(1) for details on how to change this flag.

       _ [flip]
               Vertically flip image.  When <b>--edit</b> is used, this also flips the image  in  the  underlying  file
               (see above).

       | [mirror]
               Horizontally  flip  image.  When <b>--edit</b> is used, this also flips the image in the underlying file
               (see above).

       0 .. 9 [action_0 .. action_9]
               Execute the corresponding action (0 = <b>--action</b>, 1 = <b>--action1</b> etc.)

       ⟨Return⟩ [action_0]
               Run the command defined by <b>--action</b>

       ⟨Home⟩ [jump_first]
               Show first image

       ⟨End⟩ [jump_last]
               Show last image

       ⟨page up⟩ [jump_fwd]
               Go forward ~5% of the filelist

       ⟨page down⟩ [jump_back]
               Go backward ~5% of the filelist

       + [reload_plus]
               Increase reload delay by 1 second

       - [reload_minus]
               Decrease reload delay by 1 second

       ⟨Delete⟩ [remove]
               Remove current file from filelist

       ⟨Ctrl+Delete⟩ [delete]
               Remove current file from filelist and delete it

       ⟨keypad Left⟩, ⟨Ctrl+Left⟩ [scroll_left]
               Scroll to the left

       ⟨keypad Right⟩, ⟨Ctrl+Right⟩ [scroll_right]
               Scroll to the right

       ⟨keypad up⟩, ⟨Ctrl+Up⟩ [scroll_up]
               Scroll up

       ⟨keypad Down⟩, ⟨Ctrl+Down⟩ [scroll_down]
               Scroll down.  Note that the scroll keys work without anti-aliasing for performance  reasons;  hit
               the render key after scrolling to anti-alias the image.

       ⟨Alt+Left [scroll_left_page]⟩
               Scroll to the left by one page

       ⟨Alt+Right [scroll_right_page]⟩

               Zoom to fit the window size

       ! [zoom_fill]
               Zoom to fill the window size like <b>--bg-fill</b>

   <b>MENU</b> <b>KEYS</b>
       The following keys bindings are used for the <b>feh</b> menu:

       ⟨Escape⟩ [menu_close]
               Close the menu

       ⟨Up⟩ [menu_up]
               Highlight previous menu item

       ⟨Down⟩ [menu_down]
               Highlight next menu item

       ⟨Left⟩ [menu_parent]

               Highlight child menu item

       ⟨Return⟩, ⟨space⟩ [menu_select]
               Select highlighted menu item

</pre><h4><b>BUTTONS</b> <b>CONFIG</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <u>.config/feh/buttons</u>.   This  works  like  the  keys  config  file:  the  entries  are of the form "<u>action</u>
       [<u>binding</u>]".

       Each <u>binding</u> is a button number.  It may optionally start with modifiers  for  things  like  Control,  in
       which case <u>binding</u> looks like <u>mod</u>-<u>button</u> (for example C-1 for Ctrl + Left button).

       <u>Note:</u>  Do  not use the same button for multiple actions.  <b>feh</b> does not check for conflicting bindings, so
       their behaviour is undefined.  Either unbind the unwanted action, or bind it to  another  unused  button.
       The order in which you bind / unbind does not matter, though.

       For the available modifiers, see “KEYS CONFIGURATION SYNTAX”.

   <b>BUTTONS</b>
       In  an  image  window, the following buttons may be used (The strings in [square brackets] are the config
       action names).  Additionally, all actions specified in the “KEYS” section can also be bound to a button.

       unbound [reload]
               Reload current image

       0 ⟨cursor movement while not panning, zooming, or similar⟩
               Does not have a default binding.  By binding  it  to  <b>quit</b>,  you  can  turn  feh  into  a  simple
               screensaver.

       1 ⟨left mouse button⟩ [pan]
               pan the current image

       2 ⟨middle mouse button⟩ [zoom]
               Zoom the current image

       3 ⟨right mouse button⟩ [toggle_menu]
               Toggle menu

       4 ⟨mousewheel down⟩ [prev_img]
               Show previous image

       5 ⟨mousewheel up⟩ [next_img]
               Show next image

       Ctrl+1 [blur]
               Blur current image

       Ctrl+2 [rotate]
               Rotate current image

       unbound [zoom_in]
               Zoom in

       unbound [zoom_out]
               Zoom out

</pre><h4><b>MOUSE</b> <b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Default  Bindings:  When  viewing an image, mouse button 1 pans the image (moves it around) or, when only
       clicked, moves to the next image (slideshow mode only).  Quick drags with less than 2px of  movement  per
       axis  will  be  treated  as  clicks  to  aid graphics tablet users.  Mouse button 2 zooms (click and drag
       left-&gt;right to zoom in, right-&gt;left to zoom out, click once to restore zoom to 100%) and mouse  button  3
       opens the menu.

       Ctrl+Button  1  blurs  or sharpens the image (drag left to blur, right to sharpen); Ctrl+Button 2 rotates
       the image around the center point.

       A note about pan and zoom modes: In pan mode, if you reach a window border but haven't yet panned to  the
       end of the image, <b>feh</b> will warp your cursor to the opposite border so you can continue panning.

       When  clicking  the  zoom button and immediately releasing it, the image will be back at 100% zoom.  When
       clicking it and moving the mouse while holding the button  down,  the  zoom  will  be  continued  at  the
       previous  zoom  level.   The zoom will always happen so that the pixel on which you entered the zoom mode
       remains stationary.  So, to enlarge a specific part of an image, click the zoom button on that part.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       In slideshow and multiwindow mode, <b>feh</b> handles the following signals:

       SIGUSR1
               Slideshow mode: switch to next image; reload current image if the slideshow consists of a  single
               file.  Multiwindow mode: reload all images.

       SIGUSR2
               Slideshow  mode:  switch  to  previous image; reload current image if the slideshow consists of a
               single file.  Multiwindow mode: reload all images.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here are some examples of useful option combinations.  See also: ⟨https://feh.finalrewind.org/examples/⟩

       feh <a href="file:~/Pictures">~/Pictures</a>
               Show all images in <a href="file:~/Pictures">~/Pictures</a>

       feh -r <a href="file:~/Pictures">~/Pictures</a>
               Recursively show all images found in <a href="file:~/Pictures">~/Pictures</a> and subdirectories

       feh -rSfilename --version-sort <a href="file:~/Pictures">~/Pictures</a>
               Same as above, but sort naturally.  By default, feh will show files in the string order of  their
               names,  meaning  e.g.  "foo 10.jpg" will come before "foo 2.jpg".  In this case, they are instead
               ordered as a human would expect.

       feh -t -Sfilename -E 128 -y 128 -W 1024 <a href="file:~/Pictures">~/Pictures</a>
               Show 128x128 pixel thumbnails, limit window width to 1024 pixels.

       feh -t -Sfilename -E 128 -y 128 -W  1024  -P  -C  /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/  -e  DejaVuSans/8
               <a href="file:~/Pictures">~/Pictures</a>
               Same as above, but enable thumbnail caching and use a smaller font.

       feh -irFarial/14 -O index.jpg <a href="file:~/Pictures">~/Pictures</a>
               Make an index print of <a href="file:~/Pictures">~/Pictures</a> and all directories below it, using 14 point Arial to write the
               image  info  under  each thumbnail.  Save the image as index.jpg and don't display it, just exit.
               Note that this even works without a running X server

       feh --unloadable -r <a href="file:~/Pictures">~/Pictures</a>
               Print all unloadable images in <a href="file:~/Pictures">~/Pictures</a>, recursively

       feh -f by_width -S width --reverse --list .
               Write a list of all images in the directory to by_width, sorted by width (widest images first)

       feh -w <a href="file:~/Pictures/holidays">~/Pictures/holidays</a>
               Open each image in <a href="file:~/Pictures/holidays">~/Pictures/holidays</a> in its own window

       feh -FD5 -Sname <a href="file:~/Pictures/presentation">~/Pictures/presentation</a>
               Show the images in .../presentation, sorted by name, in fullscreen, automatically change  to  the
               next image after 5 seconds

       feh -rSwidth -A "mv %F <a href="file:~/images/">~/images/</a>%N" <a href="file:~/Pictures">~/Pictures</a>
               View  all  images  in  <a href="file:~/Pictures">~/Pictures</a> and below, sorted by width, move an image to <a href="file:~/image/image_name">~/image/image_name</a>
               when enter is pressed

       feh --start-at <a href="file:~/Pictures/foo.jpg">~/Pictures/foo.jpg</a>
               View all images in <a href="file:~/Pictures">~/Pictures</a>, starting  with  foo.jpg.   All  other  images  are  still  in  the
               slideshow and can be viewed normally

       feh --start-at <a href="file:~/Pictures/foo.jpg">~/Pictures/foo.jpg</a> <a href="file:~/Pictures">~/Pictures</a>
               Same as above.

       feh --info "exifgrep '(Model|DateTimeOriginal|FNumber|ISO|Flash)' %F | cut -d . -f 4-" .
               Show some EXIF information, extracted by exifprobe/exifgrep

       feh --action 'rm %F' -rl --max-dimension 1000x800
               Recursively  remove all images with dimensions below or equal to 1000x800 pixels from the current
               directory.

       feh -L '%w %h %f' | awk '{ if ($1 &gt; $2) { print $0 } }' | cut -d ' ' -f 3- | feh -f -
               Show landscape pictures (image width greater than height) in the current directory.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       When <b>--edit</b> is used,  <b>feh</b>  needs  the  <b>jpegtran</b>  and  <b>jpegexiforient</b>  binaries  (usually  distributed  in
       "libjpeg-progs" or similar) for lossless JPEG rotation.

       To  view images from URLs such as "http://", <b>feh</b> must be compiled with libcurl support.  It is enabled in
       this build

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Imlib2 releases prior to 1.7.4 are unable to load gif, tiff, and webp images if the filename does not end
       with gif, tiff, or webp, respectively.  Notably, this means that feh is unable to  show  gif,  tiff,  and
       webp images from stdin or network URLs on systems using an Imlib2 version older than 1.7.4.

       Imlib2  releases  1.7.5+  automatically  rotate  images based on their EXIF tags.  When combined with the
       <b>--auto-rotate</b> option, this causes images to be rotated twice and end up in an incorrect orientation.   As
       a workaround, do not use <b>--auto-rotate</b> on systems with Imlib2 version 1.7.5 or later.

       On  systems  with  giflib 5.1.2, <b>feh</b> may be unable to load gif images.  For affected mips, mipsel and arm
       devices, gif support is completely broken, while on x86 / x86_64 gifs can usually only be loaded if  they
       are   the   first   image   in   the   filelist.    This   appears   to   be   a   bug   in  giflib,  see
       ⟨https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=813729⟩     for     details.      Workaround:      Use
       <b>--conversion-timeout</b> <b>5</b> (or some other positive value) to load gifs with imagemagick instead, or downgrade
       to giflib 5.1.1, or upgrade to giflib 5.1.4.

       While loading images using libcurl, <b>feh</b> will not react to key or mouse actions.

       Thumbnail mode is somewhat inefficient, and because of that not nearly as fast as it could be.

       <b>--scale-down</b> does not take window decorations into account and may therefore make the window slightly too
       large.

   <b>REPORTING</b> <b>BUGS</b>
       If    you    find    a    bug,    please    report    it    to    ⟨derf+<a href="mailto:feh@finalrewind.org">feh@finalrewind.org</a>⟩    or    via
       ⟨https://github.com/derf/feh/issues⟩.

       Please include the feh version ⟨the output of "feh --version"⟩,  steps  to  reproduce  the  bug  and,  if
       necessary,  images  to  reproduce  it.  Note that <b>feh</b> is a hobby project, so bug reports may be addressed
       with significant delays.
