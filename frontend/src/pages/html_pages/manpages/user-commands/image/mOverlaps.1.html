</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mOverlaps - Re-project and mosaic your images, with background rectification

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       mOverlaps [-e] [-d <u>level</u>] [-s <u>statusfile</u>] images.tbl diffs.tbl

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Analyze  an  image metadata table to determine a list of overlapping images.  Each image is compared with
       every other image to determine all overlapping image pairs.  A pair of images are deemed  to  overlap  if
       any pixel around the perimeter of one image falls within the boundary of the other image.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -e     Enables  'exact'  overlaps mode, as opposed to the default approximate algorithm. The default mode
              uses great-circle connecting lines between image corners to determine which images overlap.  Exact
              mode  will  instead  check the edge pixels of every image to determine which pixels are inside the
              others.

              Although the default mode will occasionally report some incorrect overlaps, this is not a  concern
              since <b>mDiff</b> will detect and ignore these false positive results when processing the table.

       -d <u>level</u>
              Turns on debugging to the specified level (1 or 2)

       -s <u>statusfile</u>
              Output and errors are sent to <u>statusfile</u> instead of to stdout

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       images.tbl
              Table of image metadata generated by <b>mImgtbl</b>.

       diffs.tbl
              Path of output table to be generated containing overlap information.

</pre><h4><b>RESULT</b></h4><pre>
       Output table contains overlap information for each pair of overlapping images.  The first two columns are
       integer  identifiers  for  the images from <b>images.tbl</b>; the second two give their filenames, and the final
       column shows the filename of the FITS file that will be generated using <b>mDiffExec</b>.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       OK     [struct stat="OK", count<u>num-overlaps</u>]

       ERROR  Cannot open status file: <u>statusfile</u>

       ERROR  Failed to open output <u>filename</u>

       ERROR  Invalid image metadata file: <u>filename</u>

       ERROR  Not enough information to determine coverages (CDELTs or CD matrix)

       ERROR  Need columns: cntr ctype1 ctype2 nl ns crval1 crval2 crpix1  crpix2  cdelt1  cdelt2  crota2  fname
              (equinox optional)

       ERROR  Bad WCS for image <u>n</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following example looks at a list of 16 images, described in images.tbl, and calculates which images
       overlap:

       $ mOverlaps images.tbl diffs.tbl
              [struct stat="OK", count=42]

       Output file: diffs.tbl.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The drizzle algorithm has been implemented but has not been tested in this release.

       If a header template contains carriage returns (i.e., created/modified on a Windows machine), the cfitsio
       library will be unable to read it properly, resulting in the  error:  [struct  stat="ERROR",  status=207,
       msg="illegal character in keyword"]

       It  is  best  for  the  background  correction  algorithms  if  the area described in the header template
       completely encloses all of the input images in their entirety. If parts of input images are "chopped off"
       by the header template, the background correction will be affected. We  recommend  you  use  an  expanded
       header  for  the  reprojection  and background modeling steps, returning to the originally desired header
       size for the final coaddition. The default background matching  assumes  that  there  are  no  non-linear
       background  variations  in  the individual images (and therefore in the overlap differences). If there is
       any uncertainty in this regard, it is safer to turn on the "level only"  background  matching  (the  "-l"
       flag in mBgModel.

       mOverlaps  generates  a  list  of images whose outer boundaries overlap. This does not guarantee that any
       image pixels within those images actually overlap; the overlap regions may  only  contain  blank  pixels,
       especially in images that have been rotated a significant amount.

       This eventually will result in a number of images showing up as "failed" when running subsequent programs
       like mDiffExec, but this will not have any effect on the final mosaic.
