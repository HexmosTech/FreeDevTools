       grk_decompress - decompresses an image in the JPEG 2000 format to a different image format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>grk_dcompress</b> [<b>-i</b> infile.j2k] [<b>-o</b> outfile.bmp]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program decompresses a JPEG 2000 image and stores it in another image format.

       Supported input formats: JP2 and J2K\J2C Supported input image extensions are .jp2 and .j2k\.j2c

       Supported  output  formats  are  JPEG, BMP, PNM, PGX, PNG, RAW and TIFF Valid output image extensions are
       jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .pgm, .pgx, .pnm, .ppm, .pam, .png, .raw, .rawl, .tif and .tiff

       • For PNG the library must have libpng available.

       • For TIF\\TIFF the library must have libtiff available.

       • For JPG\\JPEG the library must have a libjpeg variant available.

       Limitations

       • Grok supports up to and including 16 bit sample precision for decompression.  This is a subset  of  the
         ISO standard, which allows up to 38 bit precision.

       stdout

       The  decompresser  can write output to stdout for the following formats: BMP,PNG, JPG, PNM, RAW and RAWL.
       To enable writing to stdout, please ensure that the -o parameter is <b>not</b> present in the command line,  and
       that  the -out_fmt parameter is set to one of the supported formats listed above.  Note: the verbose flag
       -v will be ignored in this mode, as verbose output would corrupt the output file.

       Embedded ICC Profile

       If there is an embedded ICC profile in the input file, then the profile will be stored in the output file
       for TIF\TIFF, JPG, BMP and PNG formats.  For other formats, the profile will be  applied  to  the  decom‐
       pressed image before it is stored.

       IPTC (JP2 only)

       If  a  compressed  input  contains IPTC metadata, this metadata will be stored to the output file if that
       output file is in TIF\TIFF format.

       XMP (JP2 only)

       If a compressed input contains XMP metadata, this metadata will be stored to the output file if that out‐
       put file is in TIF\\TIFF or PNG format.

       Exif (JP2 only)

       To transfer Exif and all other meta-data tags, use the command line  argument  -V  described  below.   To
       transfer  the  tags,  Grok  uses  the ExifTool (https://exiftool.org/) Perl module.  ExifTool must be in‐
       stalled for this command line argument to work properly.  Note: transferring Exif tags may add a few hun‐
       dred ms to the decompress time, depending on the system.

       <b>Important</b> <b>note</b> <b>on</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b> <b>argument</b> <b>notation</b> <b>below</b>: the outer square braces appear  for  clarity  on‐
       ly,and  <b>should</b>  <b>not</b>  be included in the actual command line argument.  Square braces appearing inside the
       outer braces <b>should</b> be included.

   <b>Options</b>
       -h,  -help

       Print a help message and exit.

       -version

       Print library version and exit.

       -v, -verbose

       Output information and warnings about decoding to console (errors are always output).  Console is  silent
       by default.

       -i, -in_file [file]

       Input  file.  Either this argument or the -img_dir argument described below is required.  Valid input im‐
       age extensions are J2K, JP2 and JPC.  When using this option output file must be specified using -o.

       -o, -out_file [file]

       Output file.  Required when using -i option.  See above for supported file types.  If a PGX  filename  is
       given,  there will be as many output files as there are components: an index starting from 0 will then be
       appended to the output filename, just before the pgx extension.  If a PGM filename is given and there  is
       more than one component, then only the first component will be written to the file.

       -y, -img_dir [directory path]

       Path  to  the folder where the compressed images are stored.  Either this argument or the -i argument de‐
       scribed above is required.  When image files are in the same directory as the executable, this can be in‐
       dicated by a dot . argument.  When using this option, the output format must be specified using -out_fmt.
       Output images are saved in the same folder.

       -a, -out_dir [output directory]

       Output directory where compressed files are stored.  Only relevant when the -img_dir flag  is  set.   De‐
       fault: same directory as specified by -img_dir.

       -O, -out_fmt [format]

       Output format used to decompress the code streams.  Required when -img_dir option is used.  See above for
       supported formats.

       -r, -reduce [reduce factor]

       Reduce factor.  Set the number of highest resolution levels to be discarded.  The image resolution is ef‐
       fectively  divided  by 2 to the power of the number of discarded levels.  The reduce factor is limited by
       the smallest total number of decomposition levels among tiles.

       -l, -layer [layer number]

       Layer number.  Set the maximum number of quality layers to decode.  If there  are  fewer  quality  layers
       than the specified number, all quality layers will be decoded.

       -d, -region [x0,y0,x1,y1]

       Decompress  a  region of the image.  If (X,Y) is a location in the image, then it will only be decoded if
       x0 &lt;= X &lt; x1 and y0 &lt;= Y &lt; y1.  By default, the entire image is decoded.

       There are two ways of specifying the decompress region:

       1. pixel coordinates relative to image origin - region is specified in 32 bit integers.

       Example:  if  image  coordinates  on  canvas  are  (50,50,1050,1050)  and  region  is  specified  as   -d
       100,100,200,200, then a region with canvas coordinates (150,150,250,250) is decompressed

       2. pixel coordinates relative to image origin and scaled as floating point to unit square [0,0,1,1]

       The above example would be specified as -d 0.1,0.1,0.2,0.2

       Note:  there is one ambiguous case, namely -d 0,0,1,1, which could be interpreted as either scaled or un-
       scaled.  We treat this case as a <b>scaled</b> pixel region.

       -m, -random_access [random access flags]

       Toggle support for random access code stream markers if present : PLT,TLM or PLM;

       The random access flags value passed in is an or’d combination of the following flags

              1   use PLT marker if present
              2   use TLM marker if present
              4   use PLM marker if present

       example: -m 0 would disable all three markers.

       -c, -compression [compression value]

       Compress output image data.  Currently, this flag is only applicable when output format is  set  to  TIF.
       Possible values are {NONE, LZW,JPEG, PACKBITS.  ZIP,LZMA,ZSTD,WEBP}.  Default value is NONE.

       -L, -compression_level [compression level]

       “Quality”  of compression.  Currently only implemented for PNG format.  For PNG, compression level ranges
       from 0 (no compression) up to 9.  Grok default value is 3.

       Note: PNG is always lossless, so using a different level will not affect  the  image  quality.   It  only
       changes the speed vs file size tradeoff.

       -t, -tile_index [tile index]

       Only  decode  tile  with specified index.  Index follows the JPEG2000 convention from top-left to bottom-
       right.  By default all tiles are decoded.

       -p, -precision [component 0 precision[C|S],component 1 precision[C|S],...]

       Force precision (bit depth) of components.  There must be at least one value present,  but  there  is  no
       limit  on the number of values.  The last values are ignored if too many values.  If there are fewer val‐
       ues than components, the last value is used for the remaining components.  If C is  specified  (default),
       values  are  clipped.   If  S is specified, values are scaled.  Specifying a 0 value indicates use of the
       original bit depth.

       Example:

               -p 8C,8C,8c

       Clip all components of a 16 bit RGB image to 8 bits.

       -f, -force_rgb

       Force output image color space to RGB.  For TIF/TIFF or PNG output formats, the ICC profile will  be  ap‐
       plied in this case - default behaviour is to stored the profile in the output file, if supported.

       -u, -upsample

       Sub-sampled components will be upsampled to image size.

       -s, -split_pnm

       Split output components into different files when writing to PNM.

       -X, -xml [output file name]

       Store XML metadata to file, if it exists in compressed file.  File name will be set to output file name +
       ".xml"

       -V, -transfer_exif_tags

       Transfer all Exif tags to output file.  Note: ExifTool (https://exiftool.org/) must be installed for this
       command line argument to work correctly.

       -W, -logfile [output file name]

       Log to file.  File name will be set to output file name

       -H, -num_threads [number of threads]

       Number of threads used for T1 compression.  Default is total number of logical cores.

       -e, -repetitions [number of repetitions]

       Number  of repetitions, for either a single image, or a folder of images.  Default is 1.  0 signifies un‐
       limited repetitions.
