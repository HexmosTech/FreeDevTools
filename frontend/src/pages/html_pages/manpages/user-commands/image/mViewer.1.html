       mViewer - Render multi-dimensional images and large-scale images

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       mViewer  generates  a  JPEG  image file from a FITS file (or a set of three FITS files in full color).  A
       data range for each image can be defined, and the data can  be  stretched  by  any  power  of  the  log()
       function  (including  zero:  linear) or using custom gaussian histogram equalization algorithms.  Pseudo-
       color color tables can be applied in single-image mode.

       mViewer can also generate overlays on the  image  of  coordinate  grids,  source  catalogs  (with  scaled
       symbols), image outlings from metadata tables, plus various markers and labels.

       Along with a few other Montage modules, mViewer can be wrapped to support interactive image analysis from
       Python or through AJAX web interfaces.

       The  functionality  of  mViewer  goes  beyond  what  is reasonable to capture in a man page.  The user is
       therefore directed to the mViewer documentation suite.

       Examples:

       To create a grayscale image from a FITS file:

       To create a full color image from three co-registered FITS files:

       A complex example with a catalog overlay (symbol size, shape and  color  controlled  by  table  columns),
       image metadata, a coordinate grid and some custom labeling:

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The drizzle algorithm has been implemented but has not been tested in this release.

       If a header template contains carriage returns (i.e., created/modified on a Windows machine), the cfitsio
       library  will  be  unable  to read it properly, resulting in the error: [struct stat="ERROR", status=207,
       msg="illegal character in keyword"]

       It is best for the background correction  algorithms  if  the  area  described  in  the  header  template
       completely encloses all of the input images in their entirety. If parts of input images are "chopped off"
       by  the  header  template,  the  background correction will be affected. We recommend you use an expanded
       header for the reprojection and background modeling steps, returning to  the  originally  desired  header
       size  for  the  final  coaddition.  The  default background matching assumes that there are no non-linear
       background variations in the individual images (and therefore in the overlap differences).  If  there  is
       any  uncertainty  in  this  regard, it is safer to turn on the "level only" background matching (the "-l"
       flag in mBgModel.
