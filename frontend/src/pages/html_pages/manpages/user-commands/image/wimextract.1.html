       wimextract - Extract files from a WIM image

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wimextract</b> <u>WIMFILE</u> <u>IMAGE</u> [(<u>PATH</u> | @<u>LISTFILE</u>)...]  [<u>OPTION</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wimextract</b>, or equivalently <b>wimlib-imagex</b> <b>extract</b>, extracts one or more files or directory trees from the
       specified <u>IMAGE</u> contained in the Windows Imaging (WIM) archive <u>WIMFILE</u>.

       <b>wimextract</b>  is intended for extracting only a subset of a WIM image.  If you want to extract or "apply" a
       full WIM image to a directory or NTFS volume, use <b><a href="../man1/wimapply.1.html">wimapply</a></b>(1) instead.

       <u>IMAGE</u> specifies the image in <u>WIMFILE</u> from which to extract the files or directory trees.  It may  be  the
       1-based index of an image or the name of an image.  It may be omitted if <u>WIMFILE</u> contains only one image.
       You can use <b><a href="../man1/wiminfo.1.html">wiminfo</a></b>(1) to list the images contained in <u>WIMFILE</u>.

       If  no  additional  arguments  are  given, the entire WIM image is extracted.  Otherwise, each additional
       argument is interpreted as a <u>PATH</u> if it does not begin with the '@' character, or a <u>LISTFILE</u> if it  does.
       Each  <u>PATH</u>  specifies  a  file  or  directory tree within the WIM image to extract, whereas each <u>LISTFILE</u>
       specifies a file that itself contains a list of paths to extract.  If a <u>LISTFILE</u> is "-" (i.e.  the  whole
       argument  is  "@-"),  then  the  listfile  is read from standard input.  See <b>PATHS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LISTFILES</b> for more
       details.

       By default, files and directories are extracted to the current directory.  Use  <b>--dest-dir</b>  to  select  a
       different  destination directory.  Alternatively, use <b>--to-stdout</b> to extract a file to standard output to
       pipe into another program.

       A file or directory extracted from a <u>PATH</u> argument is by default extracted directly into the  destination
       directory,  whereas  a  file or directory extracted from a <u>LISTFILE</u> argument is by default extracted into
       the destination directory in such a way  that  the  archive's  directory  structure  is  preserved.   Use
       <b>--preserve-dir-structure</b> to always get the latter behavior.

       <b>wimextract</b>  supports  extracting  files  and directory trees from stand-alone WIMs as well as split WIMs.
       See <b>SPLIT</b> <b>WIMS</b>.

</pre><h4><b>PATHS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LISTFILES</b></h4><pre>
       Each path, including those on the command line and those in listfiles, must be specified as  an  absolute
       path  starting  from the root of the WIM image, like those output by <b><a href="../man1/wimdir.1.html">wimdir</a></b>(1).  However, path separators
       may be either forward or backward slashes, and the leading slash is optional.

       On Windows, by default paths are treated case-insensitively, whereas on  UNIX-like  systems,  by  default
       paths  are  treated case-sensitively.  In either case, the default behavior may be overridden through the
       <b>WIMLIB_IMAGEX_IGNORE_CASE</b> environmental variable, as documented in <b><a href="../man1/wimlib-imagex.1.html">wimlib-imagex</a></b>(1).

       By default, each path may contain the wildcard characters '?' and '*'.  The '?'   character  matches  any
       non-path-separator  character,  whereas  the  '*'  character  matches  zero  or  more  non-path-separator
       characters.  Consequently, a single wildcard path, or "glob", may expand  to  multiple  actual  files  or
       directories.  Use the <b>--no-globs</b> option to disable wildcard matching and search for each path literally.

       Each  <u>LISTFILE</u>  must be a text file (UTF-8 or UTF-16LE encoded; plain ASCII is also fine) that contains a
       list of paths to extract, one per line.  Wildcard characters  are  allowed  by  default.   The  following
       demonstrates an example listfile:

              ; This is a comment (begins with semicolon)
              # This is also a comment (begins with number sign)
              /Users
              /Windows/explorer.exe
              /Windows/System32/en-US/*

              ; Both forward and backslashes are valid.
              ; It's not necessary to quote paths containing internal spaces.
              \Program Files\A*

              ; Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored
                  \Windows\notepad*

</pre><h4><b>SPLIT</b> <b>WIMS</b></h4><pre>
       You may use <b>wimextract</b> to extract files or directory trees from a split WIM.  This uses the <b>--refs</b>="<u>GLOB</u>"
       option in the same way as in other commands such as <b>wimapply</b>.  See <b><a href="../man1/wimapply.1.html">wimapply</a></b>(1) for more details.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--check</b>
             Before  extracting  the  files,  verify  the  integrity  of  <u>WIMFILE</u> if it contains extra integrity
             information.

       <b>--ref</b>="<u>GLOB</u>"
             File glob of additional WIMs or split WIM parts  to  reference  resources  from.   See  <b>SPLIT_WIMS</b>.
             Note: <u>GLOB</u> is listed in quotes because it is interpreted by <b>wimextract</b> and may need to be quoted to
             protect against shell expansion.

       <b>--dest-dir</b>=<u>DIR</u>
             Extract the files and directories to the directory <u>DIR</u> instead of to the current working directory.

       <b>--to-stdout</b>
             Extract  the  files  to standard output instead of to the filesystem.  This can only be provided if
             all the specified paths are to regular files (not directories  or  reparse  points).   If  present,
             named data streams are not extracted.

       <b>--unix-data</b>
             See the documentation for this option to <b><a href="../man1/wimapply.1.html">wimapply</a></b>(1).

       <b>--no-acls</b>
             See the documentation for this option to <b><a href="../man1/wimapply.1.html">wimapply</a></b>(1).

       <b>--strict-acls</b>
             See the documentation for this option to <b><a href="../man1/wimapply.1.html">wimapply</a></b>(1).

       <b>--no-attributes</b>
             See the documentation for this option to <b><a href="../man1/wimapply.1.html">wimapply</a></b>(1).

       <b>--include-invalid-names</b>
             See the documentation for this option to <b><a href="../man1/wimapply.1.html">wimapply</a></b>(1).

       <b>--no-globs</b>
             Do  not  recognize  wildcard  characters  in  paths.  Each path will be searched for literally.  In
             addition, if case insensitivity is enabled, do not allow a single path to match multiple files with
             the same case-insensitive name but different case-sensitive names.

             <b>--no-wildcards</b> is also accepted as an alias for this option.

       <b>--nullglob</b>
             If a glob does not match any files, ignore it and print a warning instead of failing with an error.
             In other words, this option allows a glob to successfully match zero files.

             This option also affects paths that do not contain wildcard characters, since such paths are  still
             considered globs unless <b>--no-globs</b> is enabled.  If case-insensitivity is enabled, such a glob could
             match  multiple  files  with  the  same  case-insensitive  name but different case-sensitive names,
             whereas a non-glob path (with <b>--no-globs</b>) can match at most one file.

       <b>--preserve-dir-structure</b>
             When extracting paths, preserve the archive directory structure instead of extracting the  file  or
             directory  tree  named  by  each path directly to the destination directory.  Note: <b>--preserve-dir-</b>
             <b>structure</b> is already the default behavior for paths in listfiles, but not paths directly  specified
             on the command line.

       <b>--wimboot</b>
             See the documentation for this option to <b><a href="../man1/wimapply.1.html">wimapply</a></b>(1).

       <b>--compact</b>=<u>FORMAT</u>
             See the documentation for this option to <b><a href="../man1/wimapply.1.html">wimapply</a></b>(1).

       <b>--recover-data</b>
             See the documentation for this option to <b><a href="../man1/wimapply.1.html">wimapply</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       See <b><a href="../man1/wimapply.1.html">wimapply</a></b>(1) for information about what data and metadata are extracted on UNIX-like systems versus on
       Windows.

       Reparse-point  fixups  (a.k.a.  changing  absolute  symbolic  links  and  junctions  to  point within the
       extraction location) are never done by <b>wimextract</b>.  Use <b>wimapply</b> if you want this behavior.

       Unlike <b>wimapply</b>, <b>wimextract</b>  does  not  support  extracting  files  directly  to  an  NTFS  volume  using
       libntfs-3g.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Extract a file from the first image in "boot.wim" to the current directory:

              wimextract boot.wim 1 /Windows/System32/notepad.exe

       Extract a file from the first image in "boot.wim" to standard output:

              wimextract boot.wim 1 /Windows/System32/notepad.exe --to-stdout

       Extract a file from the first image in "boot.wim" to the specified directory:

              wimextract boot.wim 1 /Windows/System32/notepad.exe \
                     --dest-dir=somedir

       Extract the "sources" directory from the first image in "boot.wim" to the current directory:

              wimextract boot.wim 1 /sources

       Extract multiple files and directories in one command:

              wimextract boot.wim 1 /Windows/Fonts \
                     /sources /Windows/System32/cmd.exe

       Extract many files to the current directory using a wildcard pattern:

              wimextract install.wim 1 "/Windows/Fonts/*.ttf"

       Extract files using a list file:

              wimextract install.wim 1 @files.txt

        ...  where files.txt could be something like:

                     Windows\System32\*.*
                     Windows\System32\??-??\*.*
                     Windows\System32\en-US\*.*
