</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       djpeg - decompress a JPEG file to an image file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>djpeg</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>filename</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>djpeg</b>  decompresses the named JPEG file, or the standard input if no file is named, and produces an image
       file on the standard output.  PBMPLUS (PPM/PGM), BMP, GIF, or Targa output format can be selected.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All switch names may be abbreviated; for example, <b>-grayscale</b> may be written <b>-gray</b> or <b>-gr</b>.   Most  of  the
       "basic"  switches  can  be  abbreviated  to as little as one letter.  Upper and lower case are equivalent
       (thus <b>-BMP</b> is the same as <b>-bmp</b>).  British spellings are also  accepted  (e.g.,  <b>-greyscale</b>),  though  for
       brevity these are not mentioned below.

       The basic switches are:

       <b>-colors</b> <u>N</u>
              Reduce  image to at most N colors.  This reduces the number of colors used in the output image, so
              that it can be displayed on a colormapped display or stored in a  colormapped  file  format.   For
              example, if you have an 8-bit display, you'd need to reduce to 256 or fewer colors.

       <b>-quantize</b> <u>N</u>
              Same  as  <b>-colors</b>.   <b>-colors</b>  is  the  recommended  name, <b>-quantize</b> is provided only for backwards
              compatibility.

       <b>-fast</b>  Select recommended processing options for fast, low quality  output.   (The  default  options  are
              chosen for highest quality output.)  Currently, this is equivalent to <b>-dct</b> <b>fast</b> <b>-nosmooth</b> <b>-onepass</b>
              <b>-dither</b> <b>ordered</b>.

       <b>-grayscale</b>
              Force  grayscale  output  even  if JPEG file is color.  Useful for viewing on monochrome displays;
              also, <b>djpeg</b> runs noticeably faster in this mode.

       <b>-rgb</b>   Force RGB output even if JPEG file is grayscale.

       <b>-scale</b> <u>M/N</u>
              Scale the output image by a factor M/N.  Currently the scale factor must be M/8,  where  M  is  an
              integer  between  1  and  16  inclusive,  or any reduced fraction thereof (such as 1/2, 3/4, etc.)
              Scaling is handy if the image is larger than your  screen;  also,  <b>djpeg</b>  runs  much  faster  when
              scaling down the output.

       <b>-bmp</b>   Select  BMP  output  format  (Windows  flavor).  8-bit colormapped format is emitted if <b>-colors</b> or
              <b>-grayscale</b> is specified, or if the JPEG file is grayscale; otherwise, 24-bit full-color format  is
              emitted.

       <b>-gif</b>   Select  GIF  output  format  (LZW-compressed).   Since  GIF does not support more than 256 colors,
              <b>-colors</b> <b>256</b> is assumed (unless you specify a smaller number of colors).  If you specify <b>-fast,</b> the
              default number of colors is 216.

       <b>-gif0</b>  Select GIF output format (uncompressed).  Since GIF does not support more than 256 colors, <b>-colors</b>
              <b>256</b> is assumed (unless you specify a smaller number of colors).  If you specify <b>-fast,</b> the default
              number of colors is 216.

       <b>-os2</b>   Select BMP output format (OS/2 1.x flavor).  8-bit colormapped format is  emitted  if  <b>-colors</b>  or
              <b>-grayscale</b>  is specified, or if the JPEG file is grayscale; otherwise, 24-bit full-color format is
              emitted.

       <b>-pnm</b>   Select PBMPLUS (PPM/PGM) output format (this is the default format).  PGM is emitted if  the  JPEG
              file is grayscale or if <b>-grayscale</b> is specified; otherwise PPM is emitted.

       <b>-targa</b> Select  Targa  output  format.   Grayscale  format  is emitted if the JPEG file is grayscale or if
              <b>-grayscale</b> is specified; otherwise,  colormapped  format  is  emitted  if  <b>-colors</b>  is  specified;
              otherwise, 24-bit full-color format is emitted.

       Switches for advanced users:

       <b>-dct</b> <b>int</b>
              Use accurate integer DCT method (default).

       <b>-dct</b> <b>fast</b>
              Use less accurate integer DCT method [legacy feature].  When the Independent JPEG Group's software
              was first released in 1991, the decompression time for a 1-megapixel JPEG image on a mainstream PC
              was  measured  in  minutes.   Thus, the <b>fast</b> integer DCT algorithm provided noticeable performance
              benefits.  On modern CPUs running libjpeg-turbo, however, the decompression time for a 1-megapixel
              JPEG image is measured in milliseconds, and thus the performance benefits of  the  <b>fast</b>  algorithm
              are  much less noticeable.  On modern x86/x86-64 CPUs that support AVX2 instructions, the <b>fast</b> and
              <b>int</b> methods have similar performance.  On other types of CPUs, the <b>fast</b> method is generally  about
              5-15% faster than the <b>int</b> method.

              If the JPEG image was compressed using a quality level of 85 or below, then there should be little
              or  no  perceptible quality difference between the two algorithms.  When decompressing images that
              were compressed using quality levels above 85, however, the difference between the  <b>fast</b>  and  <b>int</b>
              methods  becomes more pronounced.  With images compressed using quality=97, for instance, the <b>fast</b>
              method incurs generally about a 4-6 dB loss in PSNR relative to the <b>int</b> method, but  this  can  be
              larger for some images.  If you can avoid it, do not use the <b>fast</b> method when decompressing images
              that  were  compressed  using  quality  levels above 97.  The algorithm often degenerates for such
              images and can actually produce a more lossy  output  image  than  if  the  JPEG  image  had  been
              compressed using lower quality levels.

       <b>-dct</b> <b>float</b>
              Use  floating-point  DCT method [legacy feature].  The <b>float</b> method does not produce significantly
              more accurate results than the <b>int</b> method, and it is much slower.  The <b>float</b> method may also  give
              different  results  on  different  machines  due to varying roundoff behavior, whereas the integer
              methods should give the same results on all machines.

       <b>-dither</b> <b>fs</b>
              Use Floyd-Steinberg dithering in color quantization.

       <b>-dither</b> <b>ordered</b>
              Use ordered dithering in color quantization.

       <b>-dither</b> <b>none</b>
              Do not use dithering in color quantization.  By default, Floyd-Steinberg dithering is applied when
              quantizing colors; this is slow but usually produces  the  best  results.   Ordered  dither  is  a
              compromise  between  speed  and  quality; no dithering is fast but usually looks awful.  Note that
              these switches have no effect unless color quantization is being done.   Ordered  dither  is  only
              available in <b>-onepass</b> mode.

       <b>-icc</b> <u>file</u>
              Extract ICC color management profile to the specified file.

       <b>-map</b> <u>file</u>
              Quantize  to  the  colors used in the specified image file.  This is useful for producing multiple
              files with identical color maps, or for forcing a predefined set of colors to be used.   The  <u>file</u>
              must be a GIF or PPM file. This option overrides <b>-colors</b> and <b>-onepass</b>.

       <b>-nosmooth</b>
              Use a faster, lower-quality upsampling routine.

       <b>-onepass</b>
              Use one-pass instead of two-pass color quantization.  The one-pass method is faster and needs less
              memory, but it produces a lower-quality image.  <b>-onepass</b> is ignored unless you also say <b>-colors</b> <u>N</u>.
              Also,  the  one-pass  method  is  always  used  for  grayscale  output  (the two-pass method is no
              improvement then).

       <b>-maxmemory</b> <u>N</u>
              Set limit for amount of memory to use in processing large images.  Value is in thousands of bytes,
              or millions of bytes if "M" is attached to the number.   For  example,  <b>-max</b>  <b>4m</b>  selects  4000000
              bytes.  If more space is needed, an error will occur.

       <b>-maxscans</b> <u>N</u>
              Abort  if  the JPEG image contains more than <u>N</u> scans.  This feature demonstrates a method by which
              applications can guard against denial-of-service attacks instigated by specially-crafted malformed
              JPEG images containing numerous scans with missing image data or image  data  consisting  only  of
              "EOB  runs" (a feature of progressive JPEG images that allows potentially hundreds of thousands of
              adjoining zero-value pixels to be represented using only a few bytes.)  Attempting  to  decompress
              such  malformed  JPEG  images  can cause excessive CPU activity, since the decompressor must fully
              process each scan (even if the scan is corrupt) before it can proceed to the next scan.

       <b>-outfile</b> <u>name</u>
              Send output image to the named file, not to standard output.

       <b>-memsrc</b>
              Load input file into memory before decompressing.  This feature was implemented mainly as a way of
              testing the in-memory source manager (jpeg_mem_src().)

       <b>-report</b>
              Report decompression progress.

       <b>-skip</b> <u>Y0,Y1</u>
              Decompress all rows of the JPEG image except those between Y0 and Y1 (inclusive.)   Note  that  if
              decompression scaling is being used, then Y0 and Y1 are relative to the scaled image dimensions.

       <b>-crop</b> <u>WxH+X+Y</u>
              Decompress  only  a  rectangular  subregion  of  the image, starting at point X,Y with width W and
              height H.  If necessary, X will be shifted left to the nearest iMCU boundary, and the  width  will
              be  increased  accordingly.  Note that if decompression scaling is being used, then X, Y, W, and H
              are relative to the scaled image dimensions.  Currently this option only works  with  the  PBMPLUS
              (PPM/PGM), GIF, and Targa output formats.

       <b>-strict</b>
              Treat  all  warnings  as fatal.  This feature also demonstrates a method by which applications can
              guard against attacks instigated by specially-crafted malformed JPEG images.  Enabling this option
              will cause the decompressor to abort if the JPEG image contains incomplete or corrupt image data.

       <b>-verbose</b>
              Enable debug printout.  More <b>-v</b>'s give more output.   Also,  version  information  is  printed  at
              startup.

       <b>-debug</b> Same as <b>-verbose</b>.

       <b>-version</b>
              Print version information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This  example  decompresses  the  JPEG  file foo.jpg, quantizes it to 256 colors, and saves the output in
       8-bit BMP format in foo.bmp:

              <b>djpeg</b> <b>-colors</b> <b>256</b> <b>-bmp</b> <u>foo.jpg</u> <b>&gt;</b> <u>foo.bmp</u>

</pre><h4><b>HINTS</b></h4><pre>
       To get a quick preview of an image, use the <b>-grayscale</b> and/or <b>-scale</b> switches.  <b>-grayscale</b> <b>-scale</b> <b>1/8</b>  is
       the fastest case.

       Several options are available that trade off image quality to gain speed.  <b>-fast</b> turns on the recommended
       settings.

       <b>-dct</b>  <b>fast</b> and/or <b>-nosmooth</b> gain speed at a small sacrifice in quality.  When producing a color-quantized
       image, <b>-onepass</b> <b>-dither</b> <b>ordered</b> is fast but much lower quality than the default behavior.   <b>-dither</b>  <b>none</b>
       may give acceptable results in two-pass mode, but is seldom tolerable in one-pass mode.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>JPEGMEM</b>
              If  this  environment  variable  is  set,  its  value  is  the default memory limit.  The value is
              specified as described for the <b>-maxmemory</b> switch.  <b>JPEGMEM</b> overrides the default  value  specified
              when the program was compiled, and itself is overridden by an explicit <b>-maxmemory</b>.
