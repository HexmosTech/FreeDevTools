       pamlookup - map an image to a new image by using it as indices into a table

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pamlookup</b> <b>-lookupfile=</b><u>lookupfile</u> [<b>-byplane</b>] <b>-missingcolor=</b><u>color</u> [<b>-fit</b>] <u>indexfile</u>

       All  options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You may use two hyphens instead of one.
       You may separate an option name and its value with white space instead of an equals sign.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pamlookup</b> takes a two dimensional array of indices and a lookup table as input.  For each position in the
       index array, it looks up the index in the lookup table and places the result of the lookup in the  output
       image.

       There  are two ways of indexing the lookup table: <u>whole</u> <u>tuple</u> and <u>by</u> <u>plane</u>.  The <b>-byplane</b> option controls
       which <b>pamlookup</b> does.

       In the simplest form of whole tuple indexing, each index in the index array is a single whole number  and
       the  lookup  table  associates  a whole tuple with each possible whole number index.  So for example, the
       index array might have at Row 2, Column 9 the value 23.  The  lookup  table  might  associate  the  tuple
       (1,2,3) with the value 23.  In that case, the output image contains the tuple (1,2,3) at Row 2, Column 9.

       In a more complex form of whole tuple indexing, each index in the index array is an ordered pair of whole
       numbers  and  the lookup table associates a whole tuple with each possible ordered pair index.  Modifying
       the example above, the index value could be (23, 5) instead of 23.

       With whole tuple indexing, the output thus has the same width and height as the index  image,  and  tuple
       depth and type and maxval are determined by the lookup table.

       With  whole  tuple  indexing,  if  the index image has depth 1, its sample values are single whole number
       indices.  If the index image has depth greater than 1, its tuples are ordered pair  indices  composed  of
       the first and second sample in the tuple.

       In  by-plane  indexing, the index image contains whole number indices.  Each sample in the index image is
       an index.  The lookup table maps each whole number index to another whole number.  <b>pamlookup</b> looks up the
       sample at each row, column, and plane in the index image in the lookup table and uses the resulting whole
       number as the sample value for the same row, column, and plane in the output.

       With by-plane indexing, the output thus has the same dimensions as the index image an the same maxval  as
       the lookup image.

   <b>The</b> <b>Lookup</b> <b>Table</b> <b>Image</b>
       The  lookup  table  is  a PAM or PNM image.  If the index image contains whole number indices, the lookup
       image is a single row and the index is a column number.  The lookup result is the value of the  tuple  or
       pixel  at  the  indicated column in the one row in the lookup table.  If the index image contains ordered
       pair indices, the first element of the ordered pair is a row number and the second element of the ordered
       pair is a column number.  The lookup result is the value of the tuple or pixel at the indicated  row  and
       column in the lookup table.

       The  width  of  the  lookup image should normally be the maxval of the index image plus one, so that each
       possible index sample value corresponds to one entry in the lookup table.  There are two  ways  <b>pamlookup</b>
       deals with a lookup image that does not have such a width:

       •      Scale  the lookup image to the required width.  <b>pamlookup</b> always does this with by plane indexing,
              and with whole tuple indexing, does it when you specify <b>-fit</b>.

       •      Use a default value for indices that exceed the width of the lookup image and ignore lookup  image
              columns  beyond the maxval of the index image.  <b>pamlookup</b> does this with whole tuple indexing when
              you don't specify <b>-fit</b>.

              You specify the default value with a <b>-missingcolor</b> option; it defaults to the value from  the  top
              left corner of the lookup image.

       With  ordered  pair  indexes (which implies whole tuple indexing), the same rule applies to the height of
       the index image as to the width.

       The mandatory <b>-lookupfile</b> option identifies the file containing the lookup table image.  <b>-</b> means Standard
       Input.  It won't work if both the index image file and lookup table file are Standard Input.

       You can use <b>ppmmake</b> and <b>pamcat</b> to create a lookup table file.

   <b>Example</b> <b>-</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>Tuple</b> <b>Indexing</b>
       Here is an example of <b>pamlookup</b>'s function with whole tuple indexing (<b>-byplane</b> not specified).

       Consider an index image consisting of a 3x2x1 PAM as follows:

       0   1   0
       2   2   2

       and a lookup table consisting of a 3x1 PPM image as follows:

       red   yellow   beige

       The lookup table above says Index 0 corresponds to the color red, Index  1  corresponds  to  yellow,  and
       Index 2 corresponds to beige.  The output of <b>pamlookup</b> is the following PPM image:

       red     yellow   red
       beige   beige    beige

       Now  let's  look  at  an  example  of  the more complex case where the indices are ordered pairs of whole
       numbers instead of whole numbers.  Our index image will be this 3x2x2 PAM image:

       (0,0)   (0,1)   (0,0)
       (1,1)   (1,0)   (0,0)

       Our lookup table for the example will be this two dimensional PPM:

       red     yellow   red
       black   green    red

   <b>Example</b> <b>-</b> <b>By</b> <b>Plane</b> <b>Indexing</b>
       Here is an example of <b>pamlookup</b>'s function with by plane tuple indexing (<b>-byplane</b> specified).

       Consider an index image consisting of a 3x2x3 PAM as follows:

       (0,0,0)   (1,0,0)   (2,0,0)
       (2,2,0)   (2,0,2)   (2,0,0)

       and a lookup table consisting of a 3x1x1 PAM image with maxval 7 as follows:

       3   4   7

       The lookup table above says Index 0 corresponds to the sample value 3, Index  1  corresponds  to  4,  and
       Index 2 corresponds to 7.  The output of <b>pamlookup</b> is the following 3x2x3 PAM image:

       (3,3,3)   (4,3,3)   (7,3,3)
       (7,7,3)   (7,3,7)   (7,3,3)

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       The  <u>indexfile</u>  argument  identifies  the  file  containing the index PAM or PNM image.  <b>-</b> means Standard
       Input.  It won't work if both the index image file and lookup table file are Standard Input.

       The output image goes to Standard Output.

       If you want to use two separate 1-plane images as indices (so that your output reflects  the  combination
       of both inputs), use <b>pamstack</b> to combine the two into one two-plane image (and use a 2-dimensional lookup
       table image).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see  Common
       Options ), <b>pamlookup</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       <b>-lookupfile=</b><u>lookupfile</u>
              <u>lookupfile</u> names the file that contains the PAM or PNM image  that  is  the  lookup  table.   This
              option is mandatory.

       <b>-byplane</b>
              This options selects by plane indexing.  The default is whole tuple indexing.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.72 (September 2015).  Before that, there is no by plane indexing.

       <b>-missingcolor=</b><u>color</u>
              This  option  is  meaningful  only  if the lookup image (and therefore the output) is a PNM image.
              <u>color</u> specifies the color that is to go in the output wherever the index from  the  input  is  not
              present  in  the  lookup  table  (not present means the index exceeds the dimensions of the lookup
              image -- e.g. index is 100 but the lookup image is a 50 x 1 PPM).

              If you don't specify this option or <b>-fit</b>, <b>pamlookup</b> uses the value from the top left corner of the
              lookup image whenever an index exceeds the dimensions of the lookup image.

              Specify the color (<u>color</u>) as described for the argument of the <b>pnm_parsecolor()</b> library routine .

              Another way to deal with a too-small lookup image is to use the <b>-fit</b> option.

              This option has no effect if you also specify <b>-fit</b> or <b>-byplane</b>.

       <b>-fit</b>   This option says to shrink or expand the lookup image as necessary to fit the indices  present  in
              the  index  image,  per  the  index image's maxval.  For example, if your index image has a single
              plane and a maxval of 255 and your lookup image is 1 row of 10 columns, <b>pamlookup</b>  stretches  your
              lookup  image  to  255  columns  before  doing  the  lookups.   <b>pamlookup</b>  does the stretching (or
              shrinking) with the <b><a href="../man1/pamscale.1.html">pamscale</a></b>(1) program.

              When you use <b>-fit</b>, <b>pamlookup</b> never fails or warns you because of invalid lookup image  dimensions,
              and the <b>-missingcolor</b> option has no effect.

              <b>-fit</b> has no effect when you specify <b>-byplane</b>.  <b>pamlookup</b> always has the behavior requested by <b>-fit</b>
              when it does by plane indexing.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Example:</b> <b>rainfall</b> <b>map</b>
       Say  you  have  a  set  of  rainfall  data  in a single plane PAM image.  The rows and columns of the PAM
       indicate latitude and longitude.  The sample values are the annual rainfall in (whole) centimeters.   The
       highest rainfall value in the image is 199 centimeters.  The image is in the file rainfall.pam.

       You  want  to produce a PPM rainfall map with green for the wettest places, red for the driest, and other
       colors in between.

       First, compose a lookup table image, probably with a graphical editor and the image blown way up  so  you
       can  work  with  individual pixels.  The image must have a single row and 200 columns.  Make the leftmost
       pixel red and the rightmost pixel green and choose appropriate colors in between.  Call it colorkey.ppm.

           pamlookup rainfall.pam -lookupfile=colorkey.ppm &gt;rainfallmap.ppm

       Now lets say you're too lazy to type in 200 color values and nobody really cares about  the  places  that
       have  more than 99 centimeters of annual rainfall.  In that case, just make colorkey.ppm 100 columns wide
       and do this:

           pamlookup rainfall.ppm -lookupfile=colorkey.ppm -missingcolor=black \
              &gt;rainfallmap.ppm

       Now if there are areas that get more than 100 centimeters of rainfall, they will just show  up  black  in
       the output.

   <b>Example:</b> <b>graphical</b> <b>diff</b>
       Say  you  want  to  compare two PBM (black and white) images visually.  Each consists of black foreground
       pixels on a white background.  You want to create an image that contains  background  where  both  images
       contain  background  and  foreground  where  both  images  contain  foreground.   But where Image 1 has a
       foreground pixel and Image 2 does not, you want red in the output; where Image 2 has a  foreground  pixel
       and Image 1 does not, you want green.

       First, we create a single image that contains the information from both input PBMs:

           pamstack image1.pbm image2.pbm &gt;bothimages.pam

       Note that this image has 1 of 4 possible tuple values at each location: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), or (1,1).

       Now, we create a lookup table that we can index with those 4 values:

           ppmmake white 1 1 &gt;white.ppm
           ppmmake black 1 1 &gt;black.ppm
           ppmmake red   1 1 &gt;red.ppm
           ppmmake green 1 1 &gt;green.ppm
           pamcat -leftright black.ppm red.ppm   &gt;blackred.ppm
           pamcat -leftright green.ppm white.ppm &gt;greenwhite.ppm
           pamcat -topbottom blackred.ppm greenwhite.ppm &gt;lookup.ppm

       Finally, we look up the indices from our index in our lookup table and produce the output:

           pamlookup bothimages.ppm -lookupfile=lookup.ppm &gt;imagediff.ppm
