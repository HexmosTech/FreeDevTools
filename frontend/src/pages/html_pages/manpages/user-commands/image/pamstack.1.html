       pamstack - stack planes of multiple PAM images into one PAM image

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pamstack</b> [<b>-tupletype</b> <u>tupletype</u>] [<b>-firstmaxval</b>,<b>-lcmmaxval</b>] [<u>inputfilespec</u> ...]

       All  options  may  be abbreviated to the shortest unique prefix.  You may use two hyphens instead of one.
       You may separate an option from its value with a space instead of <b>=</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pamstack</b> reads multiple PAM or PNM images as input and produces a PAM image as output, consisting of  all
       the planes (channels) of the inputs, stacked in the order specified.

       It can also just change the tuple type of a single PAM image.

       For  any  one  (but  not  more)  of  the input files, you may specify "-" to mean Standard Input.  If you
       specify no arguments at all, the input is one file: Standard Input.

       The output is the same dimensions as the inputs, except that the depth is
         the sum of the depths of the inputs.  The maxval is the same as the inputs
         if they are all alike, and controlled by <b>-firstmaxval</b>
         and <b>-lcmmaxval</b> if not.  The tuple type is a null string unless you
         specify the <b>-tupletype</b> option.

        <b>pamstack</b> fails if the inputs are not all the same width and height.  It also fails if they  do  not  all
       have the same maxval, unless you specify <b>-firstmaxval</b> or <b>-lcmmaxval</b>.

       <b>pamstack</b>  works  with  multi-image  streams.   It stacks the 1st image in all the streams into one output
       image (the first one in the output stream), then stacks the 2nd image in all the  streams  into  the  2nd
       image in the output stream, and so on, until one of the streams runs dry.  It's like a matrix operation.

       Before Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006), <b>pamstack</b> ignored all but the first image in each input stream.

       <b>pamchannel</b> does the opposite of <b>pamstack</b>:  It extracts individual planes from a single PAM.

       Use <b><a href="../man1/pamtopnm.1.html">pamtopnm</a></b>(1) to convert a suitable PAM image to a more traditional PNM (PBM, PGM, or PPM) image.  (But
       there's  no  need  to  do  that  if  you're  going to feed it to a modern Netpbm program -- they all take
       suitable PAM input directly).

       One example of using <b>pamstack</b> is that some Netpbm programs accept as input a PAM that represents  graphic
       image  with  transparency  information.  Taking a color image for example, this would be a PAM with tuple
       type "RGB_ALPHA".  In Netpbm, such images were traditionally represented as two images - a  PPM  for  the
       color  and  a  PGM  for the transparency.  To convert a PPM/PGM pair into PAM(RGB_ALPHA) input that newer
       programs require, do something like this:

       $ pamstack -tupletype=RGB_ALPHA myimage.ppm myalpha.pgm | \
             pamtouil &gt;myimage.uil

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably  <b>-quiet</b>,  see   Common
       Options ), <b>pamstack</b> recognizes the following command line option:

       <b>-tupletype</b> <u>tupletype</u>
              This specifies the tuple type name to be recorded in the output.  You may use any string up to 255
              characters.   Some programs recognize some names.  If you omit this option, the default tuple type
              name is null.

       <b>-firstmaxval</b>
              This says to make the maxval of the output the same as the maxval of the first image of the input;
              the program scales sample values of other images are as necessary.

              By default, <b>pamstack</b> requires all the input images to have the same maxval.   If  they  don't,  it
              fails.

              You cannot specify this with <b>-lcmmaxval</b>.

              This option was new in Netpbm 11.03 (June 2023).

       <b>-lcmmaxval</b>
              This  says  to make the maxval of the output the least common multiple of the maxvals of the input
              images, limited to 65535 if the LCM is above that; the  program  scales  sample  values  of  other
              images are as necessary.

              By  default,  <b>pamstack</b>  requires  all the input images to have the same maxval.  If they don't, it
              fails.

              You cannot specify this with <b>-firstmaxval</b>.

              This option was new in Netpbm 11.03 (June 2023).
