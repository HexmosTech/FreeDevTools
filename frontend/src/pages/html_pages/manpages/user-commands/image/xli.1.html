</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xli - load images into an X11 window or onto the root window

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xli</u> [global_options] {[image_options] image ...}
       <u>xli</u> [global_options] [image_options] stdin &lt; image

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xli</u>  displays  images  in  an X11 window or loads them onto the root window.  See the <u>IMAGE</u> <u>TYPES</u> section
       below for supported image types.

       If the filename <u>stdin</u> is given, xli will read the image from standard input.

       If the destination display cannot support the number of colors in the image, the image will  be  dithered
       (monochrome  destination) or have its colormap reduced (color destination) as appropriate.  This can also
       be done forcibly with the <u>-halftone</u>, <u>-dither</u>, and <u>-colors</u> options.

       A variety of image manipulations can be specified, including  gamma  correction,  brightening,  clipping,
       dithering,   depth-reduction,   rotation,   and   zooming.   Most  of  these  manipulations  have  simple
       implementations; speed was opted for above accuracy.

       If you are viewing a large image in a window, the initial window will be at most 90% of the size  of  the
       display  unless  the  window manager does not correctly handle window size requests or if you've used the
       <u>-fullscreen</u> or <u>-fillscreen</u> options.  You may move the image around in the window  by  dragging  with  the
       first mouse button.  The cursor will indicate which directions you may drag, if any.

       When the keyboard focus is in the window you can:
       Type 'q' or '^C' to exit xli.
       Type space, 'n' or 'f' to move to the next image in the list.
       Type 'b' or 'p' to move to the previous image in the list.
       Type . to reload the image.
       Type l to rotate the image anti-clockwise.
       Type r to rotate the image clockwise.
       Type 0 to set the images assumed gamma to your display gamma
              (usually darkens images)
       Type 1 to set the images assumed gamma to 1.0
              (usually lightens images)
       Type 5-2 to lighten the image (5 in small steps, up to 2 in large steps)
       Type 6-9 to darken the image (6 in small steps, up to 9 in large steps)
       Type &gt; resp. &lt; to zoom in resp. out

       A  wide  variety  of common image manipulations can be done by mixing and matching the available options.
       See the section entitled <u>HINTS</u> <u>FOR</u> <u>GOOD</u> <u>IMAGE</u> <u>DISPLAYS</u> for some ideas.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCE</b> <b>CLASS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xli</u> uses the resource class name <b>_</b><u>XSETROOT_Id</u> <u>for</u> <u>window</u> <u>managers</u> <u>which</u> <u>need</u> <u>this</u> <u>resource</u> <u>set.</u>

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options affect the global operation of <u>xli</u>.  They may be specified anywhere on the  command
       line.

       -default
              Set  the  root  background  to  the  default  root  weave.   This  is the same as <u>xsetroot</u> with no
              arguments.

       -debug Talk to the X server in synchronous mode.  This is useful for debugging.  If an X  error  is  seen
              while in this mode, a core will be dumped.

       -dumpcore
              Signals will not be trapped, and instead a coredump will occur.

       -display <u>display_name</u>
              X11 display name to send the image(s) to.

       -dispgamma <u>Display_gamma</u>
              Specify  the  gamma correction value appropriate for the display device.  This overrides the value
              read from the  environment  variable  <b>DISPLAY_GAMMA</b>,  or  the  default  value  of  2.2,  which  is
              approximately  correct  for  many  displays.  A  value  of  between  1.6 and 2.8 is reasonable. If
              individual images are too bright or dark, use the -gamma option.

       There is an image provided with xli called 'chkgamma.jpg' that lets you set the display gamma  reasonably
       accurately.   This  file  contains  two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear to the human
       eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using dithering.  When the display gamma is correct,  then
       the  two  ramps should look symmetrical, and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost
       exactly half way from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if you move away a little  from
       the screen, and de-focus your eyes a bit.)

       If  the  equal  brightness  point  is above center increase the gamma, and decrease it if it is below the
       center. The value will usually be around 2.2 Once you've got it right,  you  can  set  the  DISPLAY_GAMMA
       environment variable in your .profile

       -fillscreen
              Use  the  whole  screen for displaying an image. The image will be zoomed so that it just fits the
              size of the screen. If -onroot is also specified, it will be zoomed to completely fill the screen.

       -fit   Force image to use the default visual and colormap.  This is useful if you do not want technicolor
              effects when the colormap focus is inside the image window, but it may reduce the quality  of  the
              displayed image.  This is on by default if -onroot or -windowid is specified.

       -forall
              Apply -fillscreen and -fullscreen options to all images and not just the first.

       -fork  Fork xli.  This causes xli to disassociate itself from the shell.  This option automatically turns
              on -quiet.

       -fullscreen
              Use  the  whole  screen for displaying an image. The image will be surrounded by a border if it is
              smaller than the screen. If -onroot is also specified, the image will be zoomed so  that  it  just
              fits the size of the screen.

       -geometry <u>WxH[{+-X}{+-}Y]</u>
              This  sets  the  size of the window onto which the images are loaded to a different value than the
              size of the image.  When viewing an image in a window, this can  be  used  to  set  the  size  and
              position  of  the viewing window.  If the size is not specified in the geometry, (or is set to 0),
              then the size will be chosen to be small enough to able to  fit  the  window  in  the  screen  (as
              usual).

       -goto image_name
              When  the  end  of  the  list  of  images  is reached, go to image <u>image_name</u>.  This is useful for
              generating looped slideshows.  If more than one image of the same name as the target exists on the
              argument list, the first in the argument list is used.

       -help [option ...]
              Give information on an option or list of options.  If no option is  given,  a  simple  interactive
              help facility is invoked.

       -identify
              Identify the supplied images rather than display them.

       -install
              Forcibly  install  the  images colormap when the window is focused.  This violates ICCCM standards
              and only exists to allow operation with naive window managers.   Use  this  option  only  if  your
              window manager does not install colormaps properly.

       -list  List the images which are along the image path.

       -onroot
              Load image(s) onto the root window instead of viewing in a window.  This option automatically sets
              the  -fit  option.   This  is the opposite of <u>-view</u>.  If used in conjunction with -fullscreen, the
              image will be zoomed to just fit. If used with -fillscreen, the image will be zoomed to completely
              fill the screen. -border, -at, and -center also affect the results.

       -path  Displays the image path and image suffixes which will be used when looking for images.  These  are
              loaded from <a href="file:~/.xlirc">~/.xlirc</a> and optionally from a system wide file (normally /usr/lib/xlirc).

       -pixmap
              Force  the  use of a pixmap as backing-store.  This is provided for servers where backing-store is
              broken (such as some versions of the AIXWindows server).  It may improve scrolling performance  on
              servers which provide backing-store.

       -private
              Force  the  use  of a private colormap.  Normally colors are allocated shared unless there are not
              enough colors available.

       -quiet Forces <u>xli</u> and <u>xview</u> to be quiet.

       -supported
              List the supported image types.

       -verbose
              Causes <u>xli</u> to be talkative, telling you what kind of image  it's  playing  with  and  any  special
              processing that it has to do.  This is the default for <u>xview</u> and <u>xli</u>.

       -version
              Print the version number and patchlevel of this version of <u>xli</u>.

       -view  View image(s) in a window.  This is the opposite of <u>-onroot</u> and the default for <u>xview</u> and <u>xli</u>.

       -visual <u>visual_name</u>
              Force  the use of a specific visual type to display an image.  Normally <u>xli</u> tries to pick the best
              available image for a particular image  type.   The  available  visual  types  are:   DirectColor,
              TrueColor,  PseudoColor,  StaticColor,  GrayScale,  and  StaticGray.   Nonconflicting names may be
              abbreviated and case is ignored.

       -windowid <u>hex_window_id</u>
              Sets the background pixmap of a particular window ID.  The argument must  be  in  hexadecimal  and
              must  be  preceded  by  "0x"  (<u>eg</u> -windowid 0x40000b.  This is intended for setting the background
              pixmap of some servers  which  use  untagged  virtual  roots  (<u>eg</u>  HP-VUE),  but  can  have  other
              interesting applications.

</pre><h4><b>PERSISTENT</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  options may precede each image.  They take effect from the next image, and continue until
       overridden or canceled with <u>-newoptions.</u>

       -border <u>color</u>
              This sets the background portion of the window or clipped image which is not covered by any images
              to be <u>color</u>.

       -brighten <u>percentage</u>
              Specify a percentage multiplier for a color images colormap.   A  value  of  more  than  100  will
              brighten an image, one of less than 100 will darken it.

       -colors <u>n</u>
              Specify  the  maximum  number of colors to use in the image.  This is a way to forcibly reduce the
              depth of an image.

       -cdither

       -colordither
              Dither the image with a Floyd-Steinberg dither if the number of colors is reduced.  This  will  be
              slow, but will give a better looking result with a restricted color set. <u>-cdither</u> and <u>-colordither</u>
              are equivalent.

       -delay <u>secs</u>
              Sets  xli  to automatically advance to the following image, <u>secs</u> seconds after the next image file
              is displayed.

       -dither
              Dither a color image to monochrome using a Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm.  This  happens  by
              default  when  viewing  color  images  on a monochrome display.  This is slower than <u>-halftone</u> and
              affects the image accuracy but usually looks much better.

       -gamma <u>Image_gamma</u>
              Specify the gamma of the display the image was intended to be displayed on.  Images seem  to  come
              in  two  flavors:  1)  linear  color  images, produced by ray tracers, scanners etc. These sort of
              images generally look too dark when displayed directly to a CRT display. 2) Images that have  been
              processed to look right on a typical CRT display without any sort of processing. These images have
              been  'gamma  corrected'.  By default, xli assumes that 8 bit images have been gamma corrected and
              need no other processing. 24 bit images are assumed to be linear.  If a linear image is  displayed
              as  if  it is gamma corrected it will look too dark, and a gamma value of 1.0 should be specified,
              so that xli can correct the image for the CRT display  device.  If  a  gamma  corrected  image  is
              displayed  as  if  it  were  a  linear  image,  then  it will look too light, and a gamma value of
              (approximately) 2.2 should be specified for that image.  Some formats (RLE) allow the image  gamma
              to  be  embedded  as  a comment in the file itself, and the -gamma option allows overriding of the
              file comment.  In general, values smaller than 2.2 will lighten the image, and values greater than
              2.2 will darken the image.  In general this will work better than the -brighten option.

       -gray  Convert an image to grayscale.  This is very useful when displaying  colorful  images  on  servers
              with limited color capability.  The optional spelling <u>-grey</u> may also be used.

       -idelay <u>secs</u>
              Set  the  delay  to be used for this image to <u>secs</u> seconds (see <u>-delay</u>).  If <u>-delay</u> was specified,
              this overrides it.  If it was not specified, this sets the automatic advance delay for this  image
              while others will wait for the user to advance them.

       -smooth
              Smooth a color image.  This reduces blockiness after zooming an image up.  If used on a monochrome
              image,  nothing happens.  This option can take awhile to perform, especially on large images.  You
              may specify more than one <u>-smooth</u> option per image, causing multiple iterations of  the  smoothing
              algorithm.

       -title <u>window_title</u>
              Set  the  titlebar  of the window used to display the image.  This will override any title that is
              read from the image file. The title will also be used for the icon name.

       -xpm <u>color_context_key</u>
              Select the preferred xpm colour map. XPM files may contain  more  than  one  color  mapping,  each
              mapping  being appropriate for a particular visual.  Normally xli will select an appropriate color
              mapping from that supported by the XPM file by checking on the default X visual class  and  depth.
              This  option  allows the user to override this choice.  Legal values of  <u>color_context_key</u> are: m,
              g4, g and c.  m = mono, g4 = 4 level gray, g = gray, c = color ).

       -xzoom <u>percentage</u>
              Zoom the X axis of an image by <u>percentage</u>.  A number greater than 100 will expand the  image,  one
              smaller  will compress it.  A zero value will be ignored.  This option, and the related <u>-yzoom</u> are
              useful for correcting the aspect ratio of images to be displayed.

       -yzoom <u>percentage</u>
              Zoom the Y axis of an image by <u>percentage</u>.  See <u>-xzoom</u> for more information.

       -zoom <u>percentage</u>
              Zoom both the X and Y axes by <u>percentage</u>.  See  <u>-xzoom</u>  for  more  information.   Technically  the
              percentage  actually  zoomed  is the square of the number supplied since the zoom is to both axes,
              but I opted for consistency instead of accuracy.

       -zoom auto
              Zoom large images to fit the screen; don't zoom small images.

       -newoptions
              Reset options that propagate.  The <u>-bright,</u> <u>-colors,</u> <u>-colordither,</u> <u>-delay,</u> <u>-dither,</u> <u>-gamma,</u> <u>-gray,</u>
              <u>-normalize,</u> <u>-smooth,</u> <u>-xzoom,</u> <u>-yzoom</u>, and <u>-zoom</u> options normally propagate to all following images.

</pre><h4><b>LOCAL</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options may precede each image.  These options are local to the image they precede.

       -at <u>X</u>,<u>Y</u>
              Indicates coordinates to load the image at <u>X</u>,<u>Y</u> on the base image.  If this is  an  option  to  the
              first  image,  and the <u>-onroot</u> option is specified, the image will be loaded at the given location
              on the display background.

       -background <u>color</u>
              Use <u>color</u> as the background color instead of the default (usually white but this  depends  on  the
              image type) if you are transferring a monochrome image to a color display.

       -center
              Center  the  image  on  the  base  image loaded.  If this is an option to the first image, and the
              <u>-onroot</u> option is specified, the image will be centered on the display background.

       -clip <u>X</u>,<u>Y</u>,<u>W</u>,<u>H</u>
              Clip the image before loading it.  <u>X</u> and <u>Y</u> define the upper-left corner of the clip  area,  and  <u>W</u>
              and  <u>H</u>  define  the  extents  of  the  area.   A  zero value for <u>W</u> or <u>H</u> will be interpreted as the
              remainder of the image.  Note that <u>X</u> and <u>Y</u> may be negative, and that <u>W</u> and <u>H</u> may  be  larger  than
              the  image.  This  causes a border to be placed around the image. The border color may be set with
              the <u>-border</u> option.

       -expand
              Forces the image (after all other optional processing) to be expanded into a True Color  (24  bit)
              image.  This is useful on systems which support 24 bit color, but where xli might choose to load a
              bitmap or 8 bit image into one of the other smaller depth visuals supported on your system.

       -foreground <u>color</u>
              Use <u>color</u> as the foreground color instead of black if you are transferring a monochrome image to a
              color display.  This can also be used  to  invert  the  foreground  and  background  colors  of  a
              monochrome image.

       -halftone
              Force halftone dithering of a color image when displaying on a monochrome display.  This option is
              ignored on monochrome images.  This dithering algorithm blows an image up by sixteen times; if you
              don't like this, the <u>-dither</u> option will not blow the image up but will take longer to process and
              will be less accurate.

       -invert
              Inverts a monochrome image.  This is shorthand for <u>-foreground</u> <u>white</u> <u>-background</u> <u>black</u>.

       -merge Merge  this  image onto the base image after local processing.  The base image is considered to be
              the first image specified or the last  image  that  was  not  preceded  by  <u>-merge</u>.   If  used  in
              conjunction  with  <u>-at</u>  and <u>-clip</u>, very complex images can be built up.  Note that the final image
              will be the size of the first image, and that subsequent merged images  overlay  previous  images.
              The  final image size can be altered by using the <u>-clip</u> option on the base image to make it bigger
              or smaller.  This option is on by default for all images if the <u>-onroot</u> or <u>-windowid</u>  options  are
              specified.

       -name <u>image_name</u>
              Force  the  next argument to be treated as an image name.  This is useful if the name of the image
              is <u>-dither</u>, for instance.

       -normalize
              Normalize a color image.

       -rotate <u>degrees</u>
              Rotate the image by <u>degrees</u> clockwise.  The number must be a multiple of 90.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To load the rasterfile "my.image" onto the background and replicate it to fill the entire background:

            xli -onroot my.image

       To load a monochrome image "my.image" onto the background, using red as the foreground  color,  replicate
       the image, and overlay "another.image" onto it at coordinate (10,10):

            xli -foreground red my.image -at 10,10 another.image

       To  center  the rectangular region from 10 to 110 along the X axis and from 10 to the height of the image
       along the Y axis:

            xli -center -clip 10,10,100,0 my.image

       To double the size of an image:

            xli -zoom 200 my.image

       To halve the size of an image:

            xli -zoom 50 my.image

       To brighten a dark image:

            xli -brighten 150 my.image

       To darken a bright image:

       Since images are likely to come from a variety of sources, they may be in  a  variety  of  aspect  ratios
       which  may  not  be  supported  by your display.  The <u>-xzoom</u> and <u>-yzoom</u> options can be used to change the
       aspect ratio of an image before display.  If you use these options, it is recommended that  you  increase
       the  size  of  one  of the dimensions instead of shrinking the other, since shrinking looses detail.  For
       instance, many GIF and G3 FAX images have an X:Y ratio of about 2:1.  You can correct this for viewing on
       a 1:1 display with either <u>-xzoom</u> <u>50</u> or <u>-yzoom</u> <u>200</u> (reduce X axis to 50% of its size and expand Y axis  to
       200% of its size, respectively) but the latter should be used so no detail is lost in the conversion.

       When  zooming  color  images  up  you  can  reduce blockiness with <u>-smooth</u>.  For zooms of 300% or more, I
       recommend two smoothing passes (although this can take awhile to do on slow machines).  There will  be  a
       noticeable improvement in the image.

       You  can  perform image processing on a small portion of an image by loading the image more than once and
       using the <u>-merge</u>, <u>-at</u> and <u>-clip</u> options.  Load the image, then merge it with a clipped, processed version
       of itself.  To brighten a 100x100 rectangular portion of an image located at (50,50), for  instance,  you
       could type:

            xli my.image -merge -at 50,50 -clip 50,50,100,100 -brighten 150 my.image

       If you're using a display with a small colormap to display colorful images, try using the <u>-gray</u> option to
       convert to grayscale.

</pre><h4><b>XLITO</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xlito</u>  (XLoadImageTrailingOptions)  is  a separate utility that provides a file format independent way of
       marking image files with the appropriate options to display correctly.  It does this by appending to file
       a string specified by the user, marked with some magic numbers so that this string can be extracted by  a
       program  that  knows  where to look. Since almost all image files have some sort of image size specifier,
       the programs that load or manipulate these files do not look beyond the point at which they have read the
       image, so trailing information can safely be appended to the file. If appending this  information  causes
       trouble with other utilities, it can simply be deleted.

       <u>xli</u>  will  recognize  these  trailing  options at the end of the image files, and will treat the embedded
       string as if it were a sequence of command line <u>IMAGE</u> <u>OPTIONS</u>. Any <u>GLOBAL</u> <u>OPTIONS</u> will  be  ignored,  and
       the <u>IMAGE</u> <u>OPTIONS</u> are never propagated to other images.

       Trailing options can be examined with:

            xlito image_file ...

       Changed or added with:

            xlito -c "string of options" image_file

       And deleted with:

            xlito -d image_file ...

       For example, if you have a gif file fred.gif which is too dark and is the wrong aspect ratio, then it may
       need to be viewed with:

            xli -yzoom 130 -gamma 1.0 fred.gif

       to get it to look OK. These options can then be appended to the file by:

            xlito -c "-yzoom 130 -gamma 1.0" fred.gif

       and  from then on xli will get the appropriate options from the image file itself.  See the  <u>xlito</u> manual
       entry for more details about this utility.

</pre><h4><b>PATHS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The file <a href="file:~/.xlirc">~/.xlirc</a> (and optionally a system-wide file) defines the path and default  extensions  that  <u>xli</u>
       will  use  when  looking  for  images.   This file can have two statements: "path=" and "extension=" (the
       equals signs must follow the word with no spaces between).  Everything following the "path=" keyword will
       be prepended to the supplied image name if the supplied name does not  specify  an  existing  file.   The
       paths  will  be  searched in the order they are specified.  Everything following the "extension=" keyword
       will be appended to the supplied image name if the supplied name does not specify an existing  file.   As
       with paths, these extensions will be searched in the order they are given.  Comments are any portion of a
       line following a hash-mark (#).

       The following is a sample <a href="file:~/.xlirc">~/.xlirc</a> file:

         # paths to look for images in
         path= /usr/local/images
               /home/usr1/guest/madd/images
               /usr/include/X11/bitmaps

         # default extensions for images; .Z is automatic; scanned in order
         extension= .csun .msun .sun .face .xbm .bm

       Versions  of <u>xli</u> prior to version 01, patchlevel 03 would load the system-wide file (if any), followed by
       the user's file.  This behavior made it difficult for the user to configure her environment if she didn't
       want the default.  Newer versions will ignore the system-wide  file  if  a  personal  configuration  file
       exists.

</pre><h4><b>IMAGE</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xli</u> currently supports the following image types:

         CMU Window Manager raster files
         Faces Project images
         Fuzzy Bitmap (.fbm) images
         GEM bit images
         GIF images (Including GIF89a compatibility)
         G3 FAX images
         JFIF style jpeg images
         McIDAS areafiles
         MacPaint images
         Windows, OS/2 RLE Image
         Monochrome PC Paintbrush (.pcx) images
         Photograph on CD Image
         Portable Bitmap (.pbm, .pgm, .ppm) images
         Sun monochrome rasterfiles
         Sun color RGB rasterfiles
         Targa (.tga) files
         Utah Raster Toolkit (.rle) files
         X pixmap (.xpm) files (Version 1, 2C and 3)
         X10 bitmap files
         X11 bitmap files
         X Window Dump (except TrueColor and DirectColor)

       Normal,  compact, and raw PBM images are supported.  Both standard and run-length encoded Sun rasterfiles
       are supported.  Any image whose name ends in .Z is assumed to be a compressed image and will be  filtered
       through  "uncompress". If HAVE_GUNZIP is defined in the Makefile.std make file, then any image whose name
       ends in .gz or .Z will be filtered through gunzip.

       Any file that looks like a uuencoded file will be decoded automatically.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Zooming dithered images, especially downwards, is UGLY.

       Images  can come in a variety of aspect ratios.  <u>Xli</u> cannot detect what aspect ratio the particular image
       being loaded has, nor the aspect ratio of the destination display, so images with differing aspect ratios
       from the destination display will appear distorted.  The solution to this is to use <u>xlito</u> to  append  the
       appropriate options to the image file. See <u>HINTS</u> <u>FOR</u> <u>GOOD</u> <u>IMAGE</u> <u>DISPLAYS</u> and <u>XLITO</u> for more information.

       The  GIF  format  allows more than one image to be stored in a single GIF file, but <u>xli</u> will only display
       the first.

       One of the pseudonyms for <u>xli</u>, <u>xview</u>, is the same name as Sun uses  for  their  SunView-under-X  package.
       This will be confusing if you're one of those poor souls who has to use Sun's XView.

       Some  window  managers do not correctly handle window size requests.  In particular, many versions of the
       twm window manager use the MaxSize hint instead of the PSize hint, causing images which are  larger  than
       the  screen  to  display  in  a window larger than the screen, something which is normally avoided.  Some
       versions of twm also ignore the MaxSize argument's real function,  to  limit  the  maximum  size  of  the
       window, and allow the window to be resized larger than the image.  If this happens, <u>xli</u> merely places the
       image  in the upper-left corner of the window and uses the zero-value'ed pixel for any space which is not
       covered by the image.  This behavior is less-than-graceful but so are window  managers  which  are  cruel
       enough to ignore such details.

       The  order  in  which operations are performed on an image is independent of the order in which they were
       specified on the command line.  Wherever possible I tried to order operations in such a way  as  to  look
       the  best possible (zooming before dithering, for instance) or to increase speed (zooming downward before
       compressing, for instance).

       Display Gamma should setable in the <a href="file:~/.xlirc">~/.xlirc</a> file.

       Embedded trailing options override the command line <u>Image</u> <u>Options.</u> Command  line  options  should  really
       override trailing options.
