</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mFitExec - Re-project and mosaic your images, with background rectification

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       mFitExec [-d] [-s <u>statusfile</u>] diffs.tbl fits.tbl diffdir

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Runs  <b>mFitplane</b>  on  all the difference images identified by <b>mOverlaps</b>and generated by <b>mDiff</b>or <b>mDiffExec.</b>
       <b>mFitExec</b> creates a table of image-to-image difference parameters.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -d     Turns on debugging

       -s <u>statusfile</u>
              Writes output message to <u>statusfile</u> instead of to stdout

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       diffs.tbl
              Overlap table generated by <b>mOverlaps</b>, the last column of  which  contains  the  filenames  of  the
              difference images generated by <b>mDiffExec</b>.

       fits.tbl
              Output table of difference parameters.

       diffdir
              Directory containing difference images.

</pre><h4><b>RESULT</b></h4><pre>
       Generates  a  table,  <b>fits.tbl</b>,  containing  all  the  information generated by running <b>mFitplane</b> on each
       difference image.  <u>nimages</u> is the number of images for which this calculation was successfully performed,
       <u>nfaied</u> is the number that generated an error  condition  for  <b>mFitplane</b>,  <u>nwarning</u>  is  the  number  that
       generated  a  warning,  and  <u>nmissing</u>  is  the  number  of files that could not be found in the specified
       <b>diffdir</b>.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       OK     [struct stat="OK", count=<u>n</u>, failed=<u>nfailed</u>, warning=<u>nwarning</u>, missing=<u>nmissing</u>]

       ERROR  Cannot open status file: <u>statusfile</u>

       ERROR  Can't open output file.

       ERROR  Invalid diffs metadata file: <u>filename</u>

       ERROR  Need columns: cntr1 cntr2 plus minus diff

       ERROR  <u>svc</u> <u>library</u> <u>error</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       First, diffs.tbl is generated for a collection of reprojected images using <b>mOverlap</b>.  Next, <b>mDiffExec</b>  is
       run  on those images to create output images in the subdirectory diffdir.  At this point, we are ready to
       run <b>mFitExec</b>:

       $ mFitExec diffs.tbl fits.tbl diff
              [struct stat="OK", count=42, failed=0, warning=0, missing=0]

       Output file: fits.tbl.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The drizzle algorithm has been implemented but has not been tested in this release.

       If a header template contains carriage returns (i.e., created/modified on a Windows machine), the cfitsio
       library will be unable to read it properly, resulting in the  error:  [struct  stat="ERROR",  status=207,
       msg="illegal character in keyword"]

       It  is  best  for  the  background  correction  algorithms  if  the area described in the header template
       completely encloses all of the input images in their entirety. If parts of input images are "chopped off"
       by the header template, the background correction will be affected. We  recommend  you  use  an  expanded
       header  for  the  reprojection  and background modeling steps, returning to the originally desired header
       size for the final coaddition. The default background matching  assumes  that  there  are  no  non-linear
       background  variations  in  the individual images (and therefore in the overlap differences). If there is
       any uncertainty in this regard, it is safer to turn on the "level only"  background  matching  (the  "-l"
       flag in mBgModel.
