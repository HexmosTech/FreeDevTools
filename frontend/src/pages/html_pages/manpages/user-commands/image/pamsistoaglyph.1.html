</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pamsistoaglyph - convert a single-image stereogram to a red/cyan anaglyphic image

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pamsistoaglyph</b> [--<b>invert</b>] [--<b>sep</b>=<u>number</u>] [--<b>minsep</b>=<u>number</u>] [--<b>gray</b>=<u>number</u>] [<u>in_netpbmfile</u>

       All  options  can  be  abbreviated  to their shortest unique prefix. You may use either white space or an
       equals sign between an option name and its value.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pamsistoaglyph</b> reads a Netpbm image as input and produces a Netpbm image as output.

       <b>pamsistoaglyph</b> takes a single-image stereogram (SIS) such  as  those  produced  by  <b><a href="../man1/pamstereogram.1.html">pamstereogram</a></b>(1)  and
       converts  it to a red/cyan anaglyphic image such as those produced by <b><a href="../man1/ppm3d.1.html">ppm3d</a></b>(1).  Many people have trouble
       tricking their eyes into focusing beyond the image in front of them and are therefore unable to  perceive
       the  3-D shape hidden within a single-image stereogram.  Anaglyphic stereograms are easier to perceive in
       3-D but require a pair of red/cyan glasses such as those often used to watch  3-D  movies.  The  goal  of
       <b>pamsistoaglyph</b> is to help people who have trouble viewing single-image stereograms see the intriguing 3-D
       effect.

       <b>pamsistoaglyph</b>  can  convert single-image random-dot stereograms (SIRDS), wallpaper stereograms, and even
       dual-image stereograms to anaglyphic images.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably  <b>-quiet</b>,  see   Common
       Options ), <b>pamsistoaglyph</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       For  most  images,  no  command-line  options need to be specified.  The following options are available,
       however, for unusual circumstances.

       <b>--invert</b>
              Swap the left- and right-eye
                  images. <b>pamsistoaglyph</b> assumes that its input
                  represents a wall-eyed stereogram and generates the anaglyphic
                  image accordingly. If the generated image appears to recede into
                  the page where it should pop out of the page (and vice versa),
                  this typically implies that the input image represents a
                  cross-eyed stereogram. Use <b>--invert</b> to correct
                  the image depth.

       <b>--sep</b>=<u>number</u>
              Specify the distance in pixels between the left- and right-eye
                  images. Essentially, this corresponds to the distance between
                  repetitions of the background pattern.  The <b>--sep</b>
                  option should rarely be necessary
                  as <b>pamsistoaglyph</b> is fairly good at determining
                  automatically the eye-separation distance.

       <b>--minsep</b>=<u>number</u>
              This option is similar to <b>--sep</b> but
                  constrains <b>pamsistoaglyph</b> only to
                  a <u>minimum</u> eye-separation distance. Any distance larger
                  than <u>number</u> is acceptable.  The <b>--minsep</b>
                  option should rarely be necessary
                  as <b>pamsistoaglyph</b> is fairly good at determining
                  automatically the eye-separation distance.  The default value for
                  the minimum eye-separation distance is 10% of the image width;
                  this value seems to work well in practice.

       <b>--gray</b>=<u>number</u>
              Limit the number of gray levels to use when searching for the
                  optimal eye-separation
                  distance.  Because <b>pamsistoaglyph</b> looks for
                  repeated patterns, it is vulnerable to being confused by slight
                  variations in color.  By reducing the input image to grayscale and
                  capping the number of gray levels,
                  <b>pamsistoaglyph</b> ameliorates the effects of
                  unintentional color variations (such as those caused by conversion
                  from a low-quality JPEG image, for example). The default of 63
                  seems to work well so the <b>--gray</b> option should
                  rarely be necessary.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The registration algorithm used by <b>pamsistoaglyph</b> was developed specifically for this program. As far  as
       the  author  knows,  there  are  no  existing  algorithms  for  converting stereograms to anaglyphs.  The
       algorithm works as follows:

       •      Convert the image to grayscale to increase the ability to identify
                  matches.

       •      Count the number of pixels that match <u>N</u> pixels ahead in the
                  image for all <u>N</u> in [1, <u>width</u>/2].

       •      Maintain a running mean (mu) and standard deviation (sigma) of
                  the number of matched pixels.

       •      Store the <u>N</u> corresponding to each spike in the number of
                  matched pixels. A spike is defined as a tally that exceeds the
                  mean plus one, two, or three standard deviations. Only the first
                  spike of a given standard-deviation multiplier is stored.

       •      If a tally greater than mu+3sigma was encountered, return the
                  corresponding <u>N</u>. If not, then if a tally greater than
                  mu+2sigma was encountered, return the
                  corresponding <u>N</u>. If not, then if a tally greater than
                  mu+sigma was encountered, return the
                  corresponding <u>N</u>. If not, then return the <u>N</u> that
                  produces the minimum average distance between matched pixels
                  (i.e., <u>#matches</u> divided by <u>#pixels</u>). If no
                  such <u>N</u> exceeds the minimum allowable eye-separation value,
                  return zero to indicate failure.

       •      If the algorithm returned zero, rerun the algorithm independently
                  on each row of the input image and return the median of
                  all <u>N</u> that exceed the minimum allowable eye-separation
                  value. If no such <u>N</u> exists, abort with an error
                  message.
