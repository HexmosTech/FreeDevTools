       to designate an option.  You may use either white space or an equals sign between an option name and  its
       value.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pamtogif</b> reads a Netpbm image as input and produces a GIF file as output.

       This  program  creates  only individual GIF images.  To combine multiple GIF images into an animated GIF,
       use <b>gifsicle</b>  (not part of the Netpbm package).

       <b>pamtogif</b> creates either an original GIF87 format GIF file or the
         newer GIF89 format.  It creates GIF89 when the output needs to have features
         that were new with GIF89, to wit transparency or comments.  Otherwise, it
         creates GIF87.  Really old GIF readers conceivably could not recognize
         GIF89.  The output needs to have transparency when either the input has a
         transparency information or you specify the <b>-transparent</b> option.  It
         needs to have comments when you specify the
         <b>-comment</b> option.

       <b>pamtogif</b> generates a GIF image with a single image block, which means the image cannot have more than 256
       colors in it (it contains a single color map with a maximum size of 256).   If  the  image  you  want  to
       convert  has  more colors than that (<b>ppmhist</b> can tell you), you can use <b>pnmquant</b> to reduce it to 256.  Or
       use the more complex but faster method described under the <b>-mapfile</b> option.

       If your input image is a PAM with transparency information, <b>pamtogif</b> uses one entry in the  GIF  colormap
       specifically  for the transparent pixels, so you can have at most 255 opaque colors.  In contrast, if you
       use the <b>-transparent</b> option, one of the colors from the input becomes transparent, so the limit is  still
       256.

       <b>pamtogif</b> recognizes transparency information in the input by the
         tuple type being <b>RGB_ALPHA</b>, <b>GRAYSCALE_ALPHA</b>, or
         <b>BLACKANDWHITE_ALPHA</b>.  This is the case for any image that has
         transparency information and was created by a Netpbm program that
         manipulates visual images.  If, on the other hand, you have a PAM generated
         some other way, but you know the planes have the same meaning as implied by
         these tuple types, you can make <b>pamtogif</b> process the transparency
         information by changing the tuple type accordingly before you pass it
         to <b>pamtogif</b>.  You can use <b>pamstack</b> to change the tuple type.

       <b>pamtogif</b> was new in Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006).  In older Netpbm, use <b>ppmtogif</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see  Common
       Options ), <b>pamtogif</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       <b>-interlace</b>
              Produce an interlaced GIF file.

       <b>-sort</b>  Produce a GIF file with a color map sorted in a predictable order.

              This does <u>not</u> produce the sorted color map which is part of the GIF format.  That kind  of  sorted
              color  map  is  one  where  the colors are sorted according to how important they are, and the GIF
              header tells the viewer that it is sorted that way.  Its purpose is to allow  the  viewer  to  use
              fewer colors than are in the color map if it is not capable of displaying all the colors.

              What  this option produces is a color map sorted by red value, then green, then blue.  That can be
              useful in analyzing GIF images, particularly those made with two versions of the program,  because
              it removes some of the variability.

       <b>-mapfile=</b><u>mapfile</u>

              Use  the  colors  found in the file <u>mapfile</u> to create the colormap in the GIF file, instead of the
              colors from <u>netpbmfile</u>.  <u>mapfile</u> can be any PPM file; all that matters is the colors  in  it.   If
              the  colors  in <u>netpbmfile</u> do not match those in <u>mapfile</u>, <b>pamtogif</b> matches them to a "best match."
              You can obtain a much better result by using <b>pnmremap</b> to change the colors in the input  to  those
              in the map file.

              The  <u>mapfile</u> file is not a palette file, just an image whose colors you want to use.  The order of
              colors in the GIF palette have nothing to do with where they appear  in  the  <u>mapfile</u>  image,  and
              duplication of colors in the image is irrelevant.

              The  map  file's  depth  must  match  the  number  of  color components in the input (which is not
              necessarily the same as the input's depth  --  the  input  might  have  a  transparency  plane  in
              addition).   If your map file does not, or it <u>might</u> not, run your input through <b>pnmremap</b> using the
              same map file so that it does.

              You can use <b>-mapfile</b> to speed up conversion of an image where you already have a map file  because
              of  earlier  processing  of your image.  For example, it is common to start with an image that has
              more than 256 colors and remap its colors to a set of 256 colors so that <b>pamgtogif</b> can convert  it
              (a  GIF  can have only 256 colors; <b>pamtogif</b> without <b>-mapfile</b> fails on any image that has more than
              that) with <b>pnmquant</b>.  When you do this, <b>pnmquant</b> generates a palette to do the color quantization,
              then <b>pamtogif</b> generates an identical palette from the quantized image.  You can  save  computation
              by generating the palette once:

                  $ pnmcolormap 256 myimage.ppm &gt;/tmp/colormap.ppm
                  $ pamtogif myimage.ppm -mapfile=/tmp/colormap.ppm &gt;output.gif

       <b>-transparent=</b><u>color</u>
              <b>pamtogif</b> marks the specified color as transparent in the GIF image.

              If  you  don't  specify  <b>-transparent</b>,  <b>pamtogif</b>  does  not  mark any color transparent (except as
              indicated by the transparency information in the input file).

              Specify the color (<u>color</u>) as described for the argument of the <b>pnm_parsecolor()</b> library routine .

              If the color you specify is not present in the image, <b>pamtogif</b> selects instead the  color  in  the
              image  that  is  closest  to  the  one you specify.  Closeness is measured as a Cartesian distance
              between colors in RGB space.  If multiple colors are equidistant, <b>pamtogif</b>  chooses  one  of  them
              arbitrarily.

              However,  if  you prefix your color specification with "=", e.g. <b>-transparent==red</b>, only the exact
              color you specify will be transparent.  If that color does not appear in the image, there will  be
              no transparency.  <b>pamtogif</b> issues an information message when this is the case.

              When  you  specify  <b>-transparent</b>,  <b>pamtogif</b>  ignores explicit transparency information (the "alpha
              channel") in the input image.

       <b>-alphacolor=</b><u>color</u>
              This specifies the foreground color for transparent pixels.  A viewer may use the foreground color
              for a transparent pixel if it chooses not to have another color "show through.".  The  default  is
              black.

              This  applies  only  to pixels that are transparent in the GIF because they are transparent in the
              Netpbm input.  If a GIF pixel is transparent because of the <b>-transparent</b>  option,  the  foreground
              color is the color indicated by that option.

              Note that in GIF, all transparent pixels have the same foreground color.  (There is only one entry
              in the GIF colormap for transparent pixels).

              Specify the color (<u>color</u>) as described for the argument of the <b>pnm_parsecolor()</b> library routine .

       <b>-comment=</b><u>text</u>
              Include a comment in the GIF output with comment text <u>text</u>.

              Without this option, there are no comments in the output.

              Note  that  in  a  command  shell,  you'll  have to use quotation marks around <u>text</u> if it contains
              characters (e.g. space) that would make the shell think it is multiple arguments:
              $ pamtogif -comment "this is a comment" &lt;xxx.ppm &gt;xxx.gif

       <b>-noclear</b>

              This option causes the output not to contain any GIF clear codes.

              In GIF, the stream defines codes that represent strings of pixels as it goes.  The stream contains
              definitions of codes mixed in with the references to those codes that describe the pixels  of  the
              image.   GIF  specifies a maximum number of codes that can be defined; when the stream has defined
              that many, the stream can either just use those for the rest of the image or include a clear code,
              deleting all the string codes so that the stream can start over defining new ones.

              By far the most common choice is the clear code.  This usually results in a smaller stream because
              the set of strings of pixels that occur in an image vary over the parts of the image.  Hardly  any
              GIF encoders produce streams that don't use the clear code.

              But  it is conceivable that a stream could be smaller without the use of the clear code because it
              saves the stream having to redefine the same string codes over and over.  It could  even  avoid  a
              thrashing  situation  where  the  stream  continually defines a set of strings that never get used
              again before the maximum is reached.

              The default is to use the clear codes.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.82 (March 2018).  Before that, the program aways uses  the  clear
              codes.

       <b>-nolzw</b>

              This option is mainly of historical interest -- it involves use of a patent that is now expired.

              This option causes the GIF output, and thus <b>pamtogif</b>, not to use LZW (Lempel-Ziv) compression.  As
              a  result,  the image file is larger and, before the patent expired, no royalties would be owed to
              the holder of the patent on LZW.  See the section LICENSE below.

              LZW is a method for combining the information from multiple pixels into a single GIF  code.   With
              the <b>-nolzw</b> option, <b>pamtogif</b> creates one GIF code per pixel, so it is not doing any compression and
              not  using  LZW.   However,  any  GIF  decoder,  whether  it uses an LZW decompressor or not, will
              correctly decode this uncompressed format.  An LZW decompressor would see  this  as  a  particular
              case of LZW compression.

              Note  that  if  someone  uses  an  LZW decompressor such as the one in <b>giftopnm</b> or pretty much any
              graphics display program to process the output of <b>pamtogif</b> <b>-nolzw</b> ,  he  is  then  using  the  LZW
              patent.   But  the  patent  holder expressed far less interest in enforcing the patent on decoding
              than on encoding.

       <b>-aspect=</b><u>fraction</u>
              This is the aspect ratio of the  pixels  of  the  image.   Its  only  effect  is  to  record  that
              information  in  the GIF for use by whatever interprets the GIF.  Note that this feature of GIF is
              hardly ever used and most GIF decoders ignore this information and assume pixels are square.

              Pixels in a Netpbm image do not have aspect ratios;  there  is  always  a  one-one  correspondence
              between GIF pixels and Netpbm pixels.

              The  aspect  ratio is the quotient of width divided by height.  GIF allows aspect ratios from 0.25
              (1:4) to 4 (4:1) in increments of 1/64.  <b>pamtogif</b> implements  a  natural  extension  of  GIF  that
              allows an aspect ratio up to 4 14/64.  If you specify anything outside this range, <b>pamtogif</b> fails.
              <b>pamtogif</b> rounds <u>fraction</u> to the nearest 1/64.

              The default is square (1.0).

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007).  Before that, the pixels are always square.

       <b>-verbose</b>
              This  option  causes <b>pamtogif</b> to display information about the conversion process and the image it
              produces.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pamtogif</b> was new in Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006).  It replaced <b>ppmtogif</b>, which  created  GIF  images  for
       Pbmplus/Netpbm users since 1989.

       The  main  outward  change  in the conversion from <b>ppmtogif</b> to <b>pamtogif</b> was that <b>pamtogif</b> was able to use
       transparency information ("alpha channel") in PAM input, whereas with <b>ppmtogif</b>, one  had  to  supply  the
       transparency mask in a separate pseudo-PGM image (via the <b>-alpha</b> option).

       Jef  Poskanzer wrote <b>ppmtogif</b> in 1989, and it has always been a cornerstone of Pbmplus/Netpbm because GIF
       is  such  a  popular  image  format.   Jef  based  the  LZW  encoding  on  GIFENCOD   by   David   Rowley
       &lt;<u><a href="mailto:mgardi@watdcsu.waterloo.edu">mgardi@watdcsu.waterloo.edu</a></u>&gt;.   Jef  included  GIFENCOD's GIFCOMPR.C file pretty much whole.  Rowley, in
       turn, adapted the LZW compression code from classic Unix <b>compress</b>, which  used  techniques  described  in
       IEEE Computer, June 1984.

       Jef's  <b>ppmtogif</b>  notably  lacked  the  ability  to  use  a  transparency  mask with it.  You could create
       transparent pixels in a GIF, but only with the <b>-transparent</b> option, which allowed one to specify that all
       pixels of a certain color in the input were to be transparent.  Bryan Henderson added the  <b>-alpha</b>  option
       in  July 2001 so you could supply a mask image that indicates exactly which pixels are to be transparent,
       and those pixels could have the same color as other opaque ones.

       Bryan Henderson added another significant piece of code and function in  October  2001:  the  ability  to
       generate  a  GIF  without  using  the LZW patent -- an uncompressed GIF.  This was very important to many
       people at the time because the GIF patent was still in force, and this allowed them to make an image that
       any GIF viewer could display, royalty-free.  Bryan adapted code from the Independent JPEG  Group's  <b>djpeg</b>
       for that.

       There is no code in <b>pamtogif</b> from Jef's original, but Jef may still hold copyright over it because of the
       way  in  which  it  evolved.   Virtually  all  of the code in <b>pamtogif</b> was written by Bryan Henderson and
       contributed to the public domain.

</pre><h4><b>LICENSE</b></h4><pre>
       If you use <b>pamtogif</b> without the <b>-nolzw</b> option, you are using a patent on the LZW compression method which
       is owned by Unisys.  The patent has expired (in 2003 in the US and in  2004  elsewhere),  so  it  doesn't
       matter.  While the patent was in force, most people who used <b>pamtogif</b> and similar programs did so without
       a  license  from  Unisys  to  do  so.   Unisys typically asked $5000 for a license for trivial use of the
       patent.  Unisys never enforced the patent against trivial users.

       Rumor has it that IBM also owns or owned a patent covering <b>pamtogif</b>.

       A replacement for the GIF format that never required any patents to use is the PNG format.
