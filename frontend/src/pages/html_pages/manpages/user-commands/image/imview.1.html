</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       imview - displays and interactively analyses images

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>imview</b> [ <b>options</b> ] [ <b>image</b> <u>...</u> ]

       Where  image  is an image file in one of the supported formats, e.g: TIFF, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP, XPM, PNM,
       etc...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Imview</b> is an X11 and Windows GDI GUI application  for  displaying  images  on  screen.  It  has  advanced
       capabilities  for  interactive  image  analysis  (getting  information  out  of images) and can be easily
       controlled through a socket connection for embedding in image analysis systems.

       Imview supports a large number of popular and scientific image file formats, in part through the  use  of
       the ImageMagick library.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Here is the complete list of optional arguments for <b>imview</b>.

       <b>-</b>      Reads an image from the standard input stream. Example:

       <b>-a</b>     Reads and appends to an existing pointfile (see option <u>-p</u>).

       <b>-C</b> <b>&lt;lutname&gt;</b>
              Specifies &lt;lutname&gt; as the default look-up tables for all the images on the command line.

       <b>-c</b> <b>&lt;lutname&gt;</b>
              Applies  the  look-up  table  &lt;lutname&gt;  to  the  <b>preceding</b> image on the command line (see example
              section).

       <b>-debug</b> Starts a debugging GUI console where debugging messages can be seen (there  are  lots  of  them!).
              Under Unix messages are also appended to the file /tmp/imbugs.txt.

       <b>-delete</b>
              Any  image  given to <b>imview</b> on the command line will be deleted after <b>imview</b> exits. This is useful
              when <b>imview</b> is started from an interpreter with a temporary image as  argument.  For  safety  only
              images  with  paths  beginning  with  <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>,  /usr/tmp  or under the standard environment variable-
              controlled TMPDIR directory are effectively deleted.

       <b>-disable_io_keys</b>
              This option disables some I/O shortcut that are not menu-dependent,  such  as  c  that  closes  an
              image.  This is useful in conjunction with options <u>-hide_menubar</u> and <u>-disable_menubar</u> for limiting
              the user's interaction with the application.

       <b>-disable_menubar</b>
              This option completely disables the menu bar (but does not hide it, see <u>-hide_menubar</u>  for  that).
              Both  hiding  and disabling the menubar at the same time can be useful for producing a viewer that
              users cannot control other than through some other means than the menu (if <b>imview</b> is  embedded  in
              another application for example).

       <b>-disable_quit</b>
              This option disables the shortcut ways of quitting the <b>imview</b> application, such as the Escape key,
              clicking  the  windows  manager  `close window' button, etc. This is useful to restrict the user's
              control over <b>imview</b>.

       <b>-fork</b>  Sends <b>imview</b> to the background (works on all platforms including windows). It  is  better  to  use
              this  option  rather than the shell semantics (adding &amp; at the end of the command under Unix) when
              the server is ran in conjunction with <u>-server</u>, because imview will synchronize the foreground  and
              background processes so that the foreground process can know the server port number.

       <b>-gamma</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Sets  the  default  gamma  for all the images. A gamma between 0 and 1.0 will darken the displayed
              image while a gamma greater than 1.0 will brighten them.

       <b>-h</b>     Prints an abbreviated list of options and exits.

       <b>-hide_menubar</b>
              Hides the main menubar. The menu items are still accessible via shortcuts. For example  try  Alt+f
              to  get  the file-&gt;open menu. From there you can use the keyboard arrow keys to select a menu item
              for example. This is useful if you have little screen real estate, but confusing for the beginner!

       <b>-no_dblbuf</b>
              Do not use double buffering at certain zoom factors. This is a hack you might want  to  experiment
              with  if  you  find  that <b>imview</b> does not redraw some parts of images after closing and re-opening
              images.

       <b>-locked</b>
              Equivalent  to  all  the  following  options  used  together:   <u>-hide_menubar</u>,   <u>-disable_menubar</u>,
              <u>-disable_iokeys</u>  and  <u>-disable_quit</u>.  If run with this option, <b>imview</b> can only be controlled via a
              socket in server mode. This is useful for embedding imview in another application.

       <b>-mag</b> <b>&lt;zoom</b> <b>facto&gt;</b>
              Magnifies all images by  &lt;zoom factors&gt;. Any positive value is legal. Values  between  0  and  1.0
              will reduce the size of the images while values greater than 1.0 will expand them.

       <b>-no_magick</b>
              Disables the use of the ImageMagick library. This library is very useful for reading and writing a
              large  number of file formats but tries to do too much sometimes, such as converting text files to
              images.

       <b>-p</b> <b>&lt;pointfile&gt;</b>
              Specifies the point file name. A  pointfile  is  a  regular  text  file  in  which  point  (pixel)
              information  can be recorded. The default point file name is pointfile. This option simply changes
              that default, no other action is taken.

       <b>-portfile</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              This option is only useful in combination with <u>-server</u>. <b>Imview</b>'s server binds to  a  port  in  the
              range  7600-7700.  Because  it is often useful to have more than one image server at the same time
              and because of the interactive nature of <b>imview</b>, the precise port number is impossible to predict,
              so when the server is started it prints the port it decided to bind against on the  command  line,
              or alternatively in a file, specified by this option.

              <b>NOTE:</b>  If you are planning to send imview to the background, for this command to work as expected,
              you must also use the <u>-fork</u> option, otherwise the file might  still  be  empty  when  the  command
              returns.

       <b>-server</b>
              Starts the <b>imview</b> server. In server mode <b>imview</b> performs as a TCP/IP server on which images can be
              uploaded  and commands can be run. The aim is to make <b>imview</b> completely remote-controllable: every
              command accessible via the menu can also be made available through the server.

              <b>Imview</b> uses its own text-based protocol. For simple commands a standard telnet session  is  enough
              to communicate with <b>imview</b>. However for uploading images into <b>imview</b> a protocol similar to FTP has
              been  implemented.  A simple <b>imview</b> client is shipped in source form with the imview distribution.
              For a specification of the <b>imview</b> protocol see the full documentation.

              <b>Imview</b>'s server port number is in the range 7600-7700 which  allows  up  to  50  different  imview
              server  to  be  run  on  the same machine (each server uses up two ports: one for commands and the
              other for binary data exchange, such as uploading images).

       <b>-stopdebug</b>
              Used in conjunction with <u>-debug</u>, will stop the program after each debugging message.  To  continue
              the user must type &lt;Enter&gt;.

       <b>-v</b>     Prints the version and build numbers, the date of build, the configuration options and exits.

       <b>-wt</b> <b>&lt;title&gt;</b>
              Changes the title of the main window. The default is Imview.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       In the following examples `%' indicate the shell prompt.

   <b>SIMPLE</b> <b>USAGE</b>
        % imview

       Simply starts imview displaying the splash screen. An image can then be loaded using the menus.

        % imview myimage.tiff

       Will display image myimage.tiff.

        % imview /home/talbot/images/astro/*

       Will  display  all images in the directory  /home/talbot/images/astro/. Use &lt;spacebar&gt; to switch from one
       image to the next.

   <b>ADVANCED</b> <b>USAGE</b>
        % imview aGreyLevelImage.tif -c heat.lut

       Will display image aGreyLevelImage.tif. Assuming this image only contains grey-level information (a black
       and white photograph for example), the false colours defined in heat.lut will be applied to it.

   <b>SERVER</b> <b>USAGE</b>
        % imview -server -fork
       Port: 7600

       This will start <b>imview</b> in server mode. The only difference with the normal mode is that <b>imview</b> can now be
       "remote-controlled" via a TCP/IP connection. The port <b>imview</b> is bound to is printed on the  command  line
       when the server starts. To save it to a file use the <u>-portfile</u> option.

       A  simple telnet session can be used to remote-control <b>imview</b>, as follows. See the full documentation for
       more details:

        % telnet localhost 7600
       user talbot
       Welcome, talbot /tmp/fileBlabla 000 OK
       load "/home/talbot/images/astro/neptune.tiff"
       000 OK
       zoom factor 2
       000 OK
       end
       Connection closed by foreign host.

       <b>imclient</b> is shipped with the source distribution as an implementation of a sample client that can  upload
       images into imview, as follows:

        % imclient -p 7600 /home/talbot/images/astro/jupiter.tiff

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       See the TODO file in the source distribution or the web site for an updated list of known bugs. Here is a
       list of the most significant ones:

       • resize  still  a  problem  sometimes.  Imview  gets itself into a weird state with incorrect limits and
         partial redraws. Specifying a complete redraw should clear everything but doesn't.

       • Move to the middle of the screen. Sometimes for no apparent reason Imview moves to the  middle  of  the
         screen. This seems to be happening if the main window resises.

       • last line and last column of image often missing when scrollbar are present.
