</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pamoil - turn a PAM image into an oil painting

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pamoil</b>

       [<b>-n</b> <u>N</u>]

       [<u>pamfile</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pamoil</b> reads a Netpbm image as input and does an "oil transfer", and writes the same type of Netpbm image
       as output.

       The  oil  transfer  is described in "Beyond Photography" by Holzmann, chapter 4, photo 7.  It's a sort of
       localized smearing.

       The smearing works like this: First, assume a grayscale image.  For each pixel in the image, <b>pamoil</b> looks
       at a square neighborhood around it.  <b>pamoil</b> determines what is the most common  pixel  intensity  in  the
       neighborhood, and puts a pixel of that intensity into the output in the same position as the input pixel.

       For  color  images,  or any arbitrary multi-channel image, <b>pamoil</b> computes each channel (e.g. red, green,
       and blue) separately the same way as the grayscale case above.

       At the edges of the image, where the regular neighborhood would run off the edge  of  the  image,  <b>pamoil</b>
       uses a clipped neighborhood.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see  Common
       Options ), <b>pamoil</b> recognizes the following command line option:

       <b>-n</b> <u>size</u>
              This is the size of the neighborhood used in the smearing.  The neighborhood is this  many  pixels
              in all four directions.

              The default is 3.
