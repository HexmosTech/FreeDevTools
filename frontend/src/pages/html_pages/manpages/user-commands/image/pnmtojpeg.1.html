</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pnmtojpeg</b> converts the named PBM, PGM, or PPM image file, or the standard input if no file is named, to a
       JFIF file on the standard output.

       <b>pnmtojpeg</b>   uses   the   Independent   JPEG  Group's  JPEG  library  to  create  the  output  file.   See
       <a href="http://www.ijg.org">http://www.ijg.org</a>   for information on the library.

       "JFIF" is the correct name for the image format commonly known as "JPEG." Strictly speaking,  JPEG  is  a
       method  of  compression.  The image format using JPEG compression that is by far the most common is JFIF.
       There is also a subformat of TIFF that uses JPEG compression.

       EXIF is an image format that is a subformat of JFIF (to wit, a JFIF file that contains an EXIF header  as
       an APP1 marker).  <b>pnmtojpeg</b> creates an EXIF image when you specify the <b>-exif</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see  Common
       Options ), <b>pnmtojpeg</b> recognizes the following command line options:

   <b>Basic</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-exif=</b><u>filespec</u>
              This option specifies that the output image is to be EXIF (a subformat of JFIF), i.e. it will have
              an EXIF header as a JFIF APP1 marker.  The contents  of  that  marker  are  the  contents  of  the
              specified  file.   The special value <b>-</b> means to read the EXIF header contents from standard input.
              It is invalid to specify standard input for both the EXIF header and the input image.

              The EXIF file starts with a two byte field which is the length of the file, including  the  length
              field,  in  pure  binary,  most  significant byte first.  The special value of zero for the length
              field means there is to be no EXIF header, i.e. the same as no <b>-exif</b> option.  This is  useful  for
              when  you convert a file from JFIF to PNM using <b>jpegtopnm</b>, then transform it, then convert it back
              to JFIF with <b>pnmtojpeg</b>, and you don't know whether or not it includes an EXIF  header.   <b>jpegtopnm</b>
              creates an EXIF file containing nothing but two bytes of zero when the input JFIF file has no EXIF
              header.   Thus,  you  can  transfer any EXIF header from the input JFIF to the output JFIF without
              worrying about whether an EXIF header actually exists.

              The contents of the EXIF file after the length field are the exact byte for byte contents  of  the
              APP1 marker, not counting the length field, that constitutes the EXIF header.

       <b>-quality=</b><u>n</u>
              Scale  quantization  tables to adjust image quality.  <u>n</u> is 0 (worst) to 100 (best); default is 75.
              Below about 25 can produce images some interpreters won't be able to  interpret.   See  below  for
              more info.

       <b>-grayscale</b>

       <b>-greyscale</b>

       <b>-rgb</b>   These options determine the color space used in the JFIF output.  <b>-grayscale</b> (or <b>-greyscale</b>) means
              to  create  a gray scale JFIF, converting from color PPM input if necessary.  <b>-rgb</b> means to create
              an RGB JFIF, and the program fails if the input is not PPM.

              If you specify neither, The output file is in YCbCr format if the  input  is  PPM,  and  grayscale
              format if the input is PBM or PGM.

              YCbCr  format  (a  color  is represented by an intensity value and two chrominance values) usually
              compresses much better than RGB (a color is represented by  one  red,  one  green,  and  one  blue
              value).   RGB is rare.  But you may be able to convert between JFIF and PPM faster with RGB, since
              it's the same color space PPM uses.

              The <b>testimg.ppm</b> file that comes with Netpbm is 2.3 times larger with the <b>-rgb</b> option than with the
              YCbCr default, and in one experiment <b>pnmtojpeg</b> took 16% more CPU time to convert  it.   The  extra
              CPU  time probably indicates that processing of all the extra compressed data consumed all the CPU
              time saved by not having to convert the RGB inputs to YCbCr.

              Grayscale format takes up a lot less space and takes less time to  create  and  process  than  the
              color formats, even if the image contains nothing but black, white, and gray.

              The <b>-rgb</b> option was added in Netpbm 10.11 in October 2002.

       <b>-density=</b><u>density</u>
              This option determines the density (aka resolution) information recorded in the JFIF output image.
              It  does  not  affect the raster in any way; it just tells whoever reads the JFIF how to interpret
              the raster.

              The density value takes the form <u>x</u><b>x</b><u>y</u> followed by an  optional  unit  specifier  of  <b>dpi</b>  or  <b>dpcm</b>.
              Examples:  <b>1x1</b>, <b>3x2</b>, <b>300x300dpi</b>, <b>100x200dpcm</b>.  The first number is the horizontal density; the 2nd
              number is the vertical density.  Each may be any integer from 1 to 65535.  The unit  specifier  is
              <b>dpi</b>  for  dots  per  inch  or  <b>dpcm</b>  for dots per centimeter.  If you don't specify the units, the
              density information goes into the JFIF explicitly stating "density unspecified" (also  interpreted
              as  "unknown").   This  may  seem  pointless, but note that even without specifying the units, the
              density numbers tell the aspect ratio of the pixels.  E.g. <b>1x1</b> tells you the  pixels  are  square.
              <b>3x2</b> tells you the pixels are vertical rectangles.

              Note  that if you specify different horizontal and vertical densities, the resulting JFIF image is
              <u>not</u> a true representation of the input PNM image, because <b>pnmtojpeg</b> converts the raster pixel-for-
              pixel and the pixels of a PNM image are defined to be square.  Thus, if you start  with  a  square
              PNM image and specify <b>-density=3x2</b>, the resulting JFIF image is a horizontally squashed version of
              the  original.   However,  it  is  common to use an input image which is a slight variation on PNM
              rather than true PNM such that the pixels are not square.  In that case, the appropriate  -density
              option yields a faithful reproduction of the input pseudo-PNM image.

              The default is 1x1 in unspecified units.

              Before  Netpbm  10.15  (April  2003), this option did not exist and the <b>pnmtojpeg</b> always created a
              JFIF with a density of 1x1 in unspecified units.

       <b>-optimize</b>
               Perform optimization of entropy  encoding  parameters.   Without  this,  <b>pnmtojpeg</b>  uses  default
              encoding  parameters.   <b>-optimize</b> usually makes the JFIF file a little smaller, but <b>pnmtojpeg</b> runs
              somewhat slower and needs much  more  memory.   Image  quality  and  speed  of  decompression  are
              unaffected by <b>-optimize</b>.

       <b>-progressive</b>
              Create a progressive JPEG file (see below).

       <b>-comment=</b><u>text</u>
              Include a comment marker in the JFIF output, with comment text <u>text</u>.

              Without this option, there are no comment markers in the output.

       The  <b>-quality</b>  option lets you trade off compressed file size against quality of the reconstructed image:
       the higher the quality setting, the larger the JFIF file, and the closer the output image will be to  the
       original  input.   Normally  you want to use the lowest quality setting (smallest file) that decompresses
       into something visually indistinguishable from the original image.  For this purpose the quality  setting
       should  be  between 50 and 95 for reasonable results; the default of 75 is often about right.  If you see
       defects at <b>-quality=75</b>, then go up 5 or 10 counts at a time until you are happy with  the  output  image.
       (The optimal setting will vary from one image to another.)

       <b>-quality=100</b>  generates  a  quantization  table of all 1's, minimizing loss in the quantization step (but
       there is still information loss in subsampling, as well as roundoff error).  This setting is of  interest
       mainly  for experimental purposes.  Quality values above about 95 are <u>not</u> recommended for normal use; the
       compressed file size goes up dramatically for hardly any gain in output image quality.

       In the other direction, quality values below 50 will produce very  small  files  of  low  image  quality.
       Settings around 5 to 10 might be useful in preparing an index of a large image library, for example.  Try
       <b>-quality=2</b> (or so) for some amusing Cubist effects.  (Note: quality values below about 25 generate 2-byte
       quantization  tables,  which  are  considered  optional  in the JFIF standard.  <b>pnmtojpeg</b> emits a warning
       message when you give such a quality value, because some other JFIF programs may be unable to decode  the
       resulting file.  Use <b>-baseline</b> if you need to ensure compatibility at low quality values.)

       The <b>-progressive</b> option creates a "progressive JPEG" file.  In this type of JFIF file, the data is stored
       in  multiple  scans  of  increasing quality.  If the file is being transmitted over a slow communications
       link, the decoder can use the first scan to display a  low-quality  image  very  quickly,  and  can  then
       improve  the display with each subsequent scan.  The final image is exactly equivalent to a standard JFIF
       file of the same quality setting, and the total file size is about the same -- often a little smaller.

       <b>Caution:</b> progressive JPEG is not yet widely implemented, so many  decoders  will  be  unable  to  view  a
       progressive JPEG file at all.

       If  you're  trying  to  control  the  quality/file  size tradeoff, you might consider the JPEG2000 format
       instead.  See <b><a href="../man1/pamtojpeg2k.1.html">pamtojpeg2k</a></b>(1).

   <b>Advanced</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-dct=int</b>
              Use integer DCT method (default).

       <b>-dct=fast</b>
              Use fast integer DCT (less accurate).

       <b>-dct=float</b>
              Use floating-point DCT method.  The float method is very  slightly  more  accurate  than  the  int
              method,  but  is much slower unless your machine has very fast floating-point hardware.  Also note
              that results of the floating-point method may vary slightly across  machines,  while  the  integer
              methods  should  give  the same results everywhere.  The fast integer method is much less accurate
              than the other two.

       <b>-arithmetic</b>
              Use arithmetic coding.  Default is Huffman encoding.  Arithmetic coding tends to get you a smaller
              result.

              You may need patent licenses to use this option.  According  to  the JPEG FAQ  ,  This  method  is
              covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T, and Mitsubishi.

              The  author  of  the  FAQ  recommends  against using arithmetic coding (and therefore this option)
              because the space savings is not great enough to justify the legal hassles.

              Most JPEG libraries, including any distributed by the Independent JPEG Group since about 1998  are
              not  capable  of  arithmetic encoding.  <b>pnmtojpeg</b> uses a JPEG library (either bound to it when the
              <b>pnmtojpeg</b> executable was built or accessed on your system at run time) to do  the  JPEG  encoding.
              If  <b>pnmtojpeg</b>  terminates  with  the  message,  "Sorry, there are legal restrictions on arithmetic
              coding" or "Sorry, arithmetic coding not supported," this is the problem.

       <b>-restart=</b><u>n</u>
              Emit a JPEG restart marker every <u>n</u> MCU rows, or every <u>n</u> MCU blocks if you append <b>B</b> to the  number.
              <b>-restart</b> <b>0</b> (the default) means no restart markers.

       <b>-smooth=</b><u>n</u>
              Smooth  the  input  image  to  eliminate dithering noise.  <u>n</u>, ranging from 1 to 100, indicates the
              strength of smoothing.  0 (the default) means no smoothing.

       <b>-maxmemory=</b><u>n</u>
              Set a limit for amount of memory to use in processing large images.   Value  is  in  thousands  of
              bytes, or millions of bytes if you append <b>M</b> to the number.  For example, <b>-max=4m</b> selects 4,000,000
              bytes.  If <b>pnmtojpeg</b> needs more space, it will use temporary files.

       <b>-verbose</b>
              Print  to  the  Standard Error file messages about the conversion process.  This can be helpful in
              debugging problems.

       The <b>-restart</b> option tells <b>pnmtojpeg</b>  to insert extra markers that allow a JPEG decoder  to  resynchronize
       after  a  transmission error.  Without restart markers, any damage to a compressed file will usually ruin
       the image from the point of the error to the end of the  image;  with  restart  markers,  the  damage  is
       usually  confined  to  the  portion  of  the image up to the next restart marker.  Of course, the restart
       markers occupy extra space.   We  recommend  <b>-restart=1</b>  for  images  that  will  be  transmitted  across
       unreliable networks such as Usenet.

       The <b>-smooth</b> option filters the input to eliminate fine-scale noise.  This is often useful when converting
       dithered  images  to  JFIF: a moderate smoothing factor of 10 to 50 gets rid of dithering patterns in the
       input file, resulting in a smaller JFIF file and a better-looking image.  Too large  a  smoothing  factor
       will visibly blur the image, however.

   <b>Wizard</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-baseline</b>
              Force baseline-compatible quantization tables to be generated.  This clamps quantization values to
              8  bits even at low quality settings.  (This switch is poorly named, since it does not ensure that
              the output is actually baseline JPEG.   For  example,  you  can  use  <b>-baseline</b>  and  <b>-progressive</b>
              together.)

       <b>-qtables=</b><u>filespec</u>
              Use the quantization tables given in the specified text file.

       <b>-qslots=n[,...]</b>
              Select which quantization table to use for each color component.

       <b>-sample=</b><u>H</u><b>x</b><u>V</u>[,...]
              Set JPEG sampling factors for each color component.

       <b>-scans=</b><u>filespec</u>
              Use the scan script given in the specified text file.  See below for information on scan scripts.

       <b>-tracelevel=</b><u>N</u>
              This  sets  the  level  of debug tracing the program outputs as it runs.  0 means none, and is the
              default.  This level primarily controls tracing of the JPEG library, and you can get  some  pretty
              interesting information about the compression process.

       The  "wizard"  options are intended for experimentation with JPEG.  If you don't know what you are doing,
       <b>don't</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b>.  These switches are documented further  in  the  file  wizard.doc  that  comes  with  the
       Independent JPEG Group's JPEG library.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This example compresses the PPM file foo.ppm with a quality factor of 60 and saves the output as foo.jpg:

           <b>pnmtojpeg</b> <b>-quality=60</b> <b>foo.ppm</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>foo.jpg</b>

       Here's a more typical example.  It converts from BMP to JFIF:

           <b>cat</b> <b>foo.bmp</b> <b>|</b> <b>bmptoppm</b> <b>|</b> <b>pnmtojpeg</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>foo.jpg</b>

</pre><h4><b>JPEG</b> <b>LOSS</b></h4><pre>
       When  you compress with JPEG, you lose information -- i.e. the resulting image has somewhat lower quality
       than the original.  This is a characteristic of JPEG itself, not any particular program.  So  if  you  do
       the usual Netpbm thing and convert from JFIF to PNM, manipulate, then convert back to JFIF, you will lose
       quality.   The  more  you  do it, the more you lose.  Drawings (charts, cartoons, line drawings, and such
       with few colors and sharp edges) suffer the most.

       To avoid this, you can use a compressed image format other than JPEG.  PNG and JPEG2000 are good choices,
       and Netpbm contains converters for those.

       If you need to use JFIF on a drawing, you should experiment with <b>pnmtojpeg</b>'s <b>-quality</b> and <b>-smooth</b> options
       to get a satisfactory conversion.  <b>-smooth</b> <b>10</b> or so is often helpful.

       Because of the loss, you should do all the manipulation you have to do on the image in some other  format
       and  convert  to  JFIF  as the last step.  And if you can keep a copy in the original format, so much the
       better.

       The <b>-optimize</b> option to <b>pnmtojpeg</b> is worth using when you are making a "final"  version  for  posting  or
       archiving.   It's  also  a win when you are using low quality settings to make very small JFIF files; the
       percentage improvement is often a lot more than it is on larger files.  (At present,  <b>-optimize</b>  mode  is
       automatically in effect when you generate a progressive JPEG file).

       You  can do flipping and rotating transformations losslessly with the program <b>jpegtran</b>, which is packaged
       with the Independent Jpeg Group's JPEG library.  <b>jpegtran</b> exercises its intimate  knowledge  of  the  way
       JPEG works to do the transformation without ever actually decompressing the image.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b></h4><pre>
       Another  program, <b>cjpeg</b>, is similar.  <b>cjpeg</b> is maintained by the Independent JPEG Group and packaged with
       the JPEG library which <b>pnmtojpeg</b> uses for all its JPEG work.  Because of  that,  you  may  expect  it  to
       exploit  more  current JPEG features.  Also, since you have to have the library to run <b>pnmtojpeg</b>, but not
       vice versa, <b>cjpeg</b> may be more commonly available.

       On the other hand, <b>cjpeg</b> does not use the NetPBM libraries to process its input, as all the NetPBM  tools
       such  as  <b>pnmtojpeg</b>  do.   This means it is less likely to be consistent with all the other programs that
       deal with the NetPBM formats.  Also, the command syntax of <b>pnmtojpeg</b> is consistent with that of the other
       Netpbm tools, unlike <b>cjpeg</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SCAN</b> <b>SCRIPTS</b></h4><pre>
       Use the <b>-scan</b> option to specify a scan script.  Or use the <b>-progressive</b> option to  specify  a  particular
       built-in scan script.

       Just  what  a  scan script is, and the basic format of the scan script file, is covered in the <b>wizard.doc</b>
       file that comes with the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG library.  Scan scripts are same for  <b>pnmtojpeg</b>  as
       the are for <b>cjpeg</b>.

       This section contains additional information that isn't, but probably should be, in that document.

       First, there are many restrictions on what is a valid scan script.  The JPEG library, and thus <b>pnmtojpeg</b>,
       checks thoroughly for any lack of compliance with these restrictions, but does little to tell you how the
       script fails to comply.  The messages are very general and sometimes untrue.

       To  start  with, the entries for the DC coefficient must come before any entries for the AC coefficients.
       The DC coefficient is Coefficient 0; all the other coefficients are AC coefficients.  So in an entry  for
       the  DC  coefficient,  the two numbers after the colon must be 0 and 0.  In an entry for AC coefficients,
       the first number after the colon must not be 0.

       In a DC entry, the color components must be in increasing order.  E.g. "0,2,1" before the colon is wrong.
       So is "0,0,0".

       In an entry for an AC coefficient, you must specify only one color component.  I.e. there can be only one
       number before the colon.

       In the first entry for a particular coefficient for a particular color component, the "Ah" value must  be
       zero,  but the Al value can be any valid bit number.  In subsequent entries, Ah must be the Al value from
       the previous entry (for that coefficient for that color component), and the Al value  must  be  one  less
       than the Ah value.

       The  script  must  ultimately  specify  at  least  some  of the DC coefficient for every color component.
       Otherwise, you get the error message "Script does not transmit all the data."  You need not  specify  all
       of the bits of the DC coefficient, or any of the AC coefficients.

       There  is  a  standard  option  in building the JPEG library to omit scan script capability.  If for some
       reason your library was built with this option, you get the message "Requested  feature  was  omitted  at
       compile time."

       <b>JPEGMEM</b>
              If  this  environment  variable  is  set,  its  value  is  the default memory limit.  The value is
              specified as described for the <b>-maxmemory</b> option.  An explicit <b>-maxmemory</b>   option  overrides  any
              <b>JPEGMEM</b>.
