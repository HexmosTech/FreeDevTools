</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xloadimage, xsetbg, xview - load images into an X11 window or onto the root window

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xloadimage</u> [global_options] {[image_options] image ...}
       <u>xloadimage</u> [global_options] [image_options] stdin &lt; image

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xloadimage</u> displays images in an X11 window, loads them onto the root window, or writes them into a file.
       Many image types are recognized; use the <u>-supported</u> option to list them.

       If  the  filename  <u>stdin</u>  or  <u>-</u>  is  given,  xloadimage  will  read the image from standard input if this
       capability is supported by the loader for that image type (most types do support reading from stdin).

       If the destination display cannot support the number of colors in the image, the image will  be  dithered
       (monochrome  destination) or have its colormap reduced (color destination) as appropriate.  This can also
       be done forcibly with the <u>-halftone</u>, <u>-dither</u>, and <u>-colors</u> options.

       A variety of image manipulations can be specified, including  gamma  correction,  brightening,  clipping,
       dithering,   depth‐reduction,   rotation,   and   zooming.   Most  of  these  manipulations  have  simple
       implementations; speed was opted for above accuracy.

       If you are viewing a large image in a window, the initial window will be at most 90% of the size  of  the
       display  unless  the  window manager does not correctly handle window size requests or if you've used the
       <u>-fullscreen</u> option.  You may move the image around in the window by dragging with the first mouse button.
       The cursor will indicate which directions you may drag, if any.  You may exit the window by typing 'q' or
       '^C' when the keyboard focus is on the window.

       If more than one image file is specified on the command line, each image will be shown in  order  (except
       if <u>-merge</u> or <u>-goto</u> are being used).

       A  wide  variety  of common image manipulations can be done by mixing and matching the available options.
       See the section entitled <u>HINTS</u> <u>FOR</u> <u>GOOD</u> <u>IMAGE</u> <u>DISPLAYS</u> for some ideas.

       The <u>-dump</u> option causes an image to be written to a file rather than displayed  after  processing.   This
       allows  you  to  read  an  image, perform a number of processing operations on it, and save the resultant
       image.  This also allows translation from any of the recognized image types into any of the formats  that
       support dumping.

       <u>Xsetbg</u> is equivalent to <u>xloadimage</u> <u>-onroot</u> <u>-quiet</u> and <u>xview</u> is equivalent to <u>xloadimage</u> <u>-view</u> <u>-verbose</u>.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCE</b> <b>CLASS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xloadimage</u>  uses  the  resource  class  name <u>Xloadimage</u> for window managers which need this resource set.
       This name changed in version 2.00 and 2.01; some previous versions used the name  <u>XLoadImage</u>  (which  was
       difficult to predict) or <u>xloadimage</u> (which conflicted with class naming conventions).

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  options affect the global operation of <u>xloadimage</u>.  They may be specified anywhere on the
       command line.  Additionally the <u>-global</u> option can be used to force an  image  option  to  apply  to  all
       images.

       -border <u>color</u>
               This sets the background portion of the window which is not covered by any images to be <u>color</u>.

       -configuration
               Displays  the  image  path, image suffixes, and supported filters which will be used when looking
               for and reading images.  These are loaded from <a href="file:~/.xloadimagerc">~/.xloadimagerc</a> and optionally from  a  systemwide
               file (normally /usr/lib/xloadimagerc).  This replaces the -path option.

       -default
               Use the default root weave as the image.  This option forces <u>-onroot</u>.  If <u>-default</u> is used alone,
               it  is the same as <u>xsetroot</u> with no arguments.  If used in conjunction with <u>-tile</u> this option can
               be used to place images on the default root weave (see <b>EXAMPLES</b> below).

       -debug  Talk to the X server in synchronous mode.  This is useful for debugging.  If an X error  is  seen
               while in this mode, a core will be dumped.

       -display <u>display_name</u>
               X11 display name to send the image(s) to.

       -dump <u>image_type[,option[=value]]</u> <u>dump_file</u>
               Rather  than  displaying  the  loaded  and  processed  image,  dump  it into an image file of the
               specified type.  For a list of image types that can be dumped, use the <u>-supported</u>  option.   Some
               image  types  have  options  that affect the format of the file that's created.  See <b>DUMP</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
               below.  An image can be dumped in any supported dump format  regardless  of  the  original  image
               type, so image file type translation is possible using this option.

       -fit    Force  image  to  use  the  default  visual  and  colormap.   This  is  useful if you do not want
               technicolor effects when the colormap focus is inside the image window, but  it  may  reduce  the
               quality of the displayed image.  This is on by default if -onroot or -windowid is specified.

       -fork   Fork  xloadimage.   This  causes  xloadimage  to disassociate itself from the shell.  This option
               automatically turns on -quiet.

       -fullscreen
               Use the entire screen to display images.  If combined with -onroot, the image will be  zoomed  to
               fill the entire rootwindow.

       -geometry <u>WxH[{+-X}{+-}Y]</u>
               This  sets  the size of the window onto which the images are loaded to a different value than the
               size of the image.  When viewing an image in a window, this can be used to reduce the size of the
               destination window.  When loading an image onto the root window, this option controls the size of
               the pixmap which will be loaded onto the root.  If the size is smaller than that of the  display,
               the image will be replicated.

       -goto image_name
               Forces  the  next  image  to  be  displayed to be the image named <u>image_name</u>.  This is useful for
               generating looped slideshows.  If more than one image of the same name as the  target  exists  on
               the argument list, the first in the argument list is used.

       -help [option ...]
               Give  information  on  an option or list of options.  If no option is given, a simple interactive
               help facility is invoked.

       -identify
               Identify the supplied images rather than display them.

       -install
               Forcibly install the image's colormap when the window is focused.  This violates ICCCM  standards
               and  only  exists  to  allow  operation with naive window managers.  Use this option only if your
               window manager does not install colormaps properly.

       -list   List the images which are along the image path.

       -onroot Load image(s) onto the root window instead of viewing in a  window.   This  option  automatically
               sets the -fit option.  This is the opposite of <u>-view</u>.  <u>XSetbg</u> has this option set by default.

       -path   Displays  miscellaneous information about the program configuration.  This option is obsolete and
               has been replaced by -configuration.

       -pixmap Force the use of a pixmap as backing‐store.  This is provided for servers where backing‐store  is
               broken (such as some versions of the AIXWindows server).  It may improve scrolling performance on
               servers which provide backing‐store.

       -private
               Force  the  use of a private colormap.  Normally colors are allocated shared unless there are not
               enough colors available.

       -quiet  Forces <u>xloadimage</u> and <u>xview</u> to be quiet.  This is the default for <u>xsetbg</u>, but the others like  to
               whistle.

       -supported
               List the supported image types.

       -type <u>type_name</u>
               Forces <u>xloadimage</u> to try to load the image as a particular file type rather than trying to guess.
               This often improves load performance noticeably.

       -verbose
               Causes  <u>xloadimage</u>  to  be  talkative,  telling  you what kind of image it's playing with and any
               special processing that it has to do.  This is the default for <u>xview</u> and <u>xloadimage</u>.

       -version
               Print the version number and patchlevel of this version of <u>xloadimage</u>.

       -view   View image(s) in a window.  This is the opposite  of  <u>-onroot</u>  and  the  default  for  <u>xview</u>  and
               <u>xloadimage</u>.

       -visual <u>visual_name</u>
               Force  the  use of a specific visual type to display an image.  Normally <u>xloadimage</u> tries to pick
               the best available  image  for  a  particular  image  type.   The  available  visual  types  are:
               DirectColor,  TrueColor,  PseudoColor,  StaticColor,  GrayScale,  and StaticGray.  Nonconflicting
               names may be abbreviated and case is ignored.

       -windowid <u>hex_window_id</u>
               Sets the background pixmap of a particular window ID.  The argument must be  in  hexadecimal  and
               must  be  preceded  by  "0x" (<u>eg</u> -windowid 0x40000b.  This is intended for setting the background
               pixmap of some servers which  use  untagged  virtual  roots  (<u>eg</u>  HP-VUE),  but  can  have  other
               interesting applications.

</pre><h4><b>IMAGE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options may precede each image.  These options are local to the image they precede.

       -at <u>X</u>,<u>Y</u>
              Indicates  coordinates  to load the image at on the base image.  If this is an option to the first
              image, and the <u>-onroot</u> option is specified, the image will be loaded at the given location on  the
              display background.

       -background <u>color</u>
              Use  <u>color</u>  as  the background color instead of the default (usually white but this depends on the
              image type) if you are transferring a monochrome image to a color display.

       -brighten <u>percentage</u>
              Specify a percentage multiplier for a color image's colormap.  A  value  of  more  than  100  will
              brighten an image, one of less than 100 will darken it.

       -center
              Center  the  image  on  the  base  image loaded.  If this is an option to the first image, and the
              <u>-onroot</u> option is specified, the image will be centered on the display background.

       -clip <u>X</u>,<u>Y</u>,<u>W</u>,<u>H</u>
              Clip the image before loading it.  <u>X</u> and <u>Y</u> define the upper‐left corner of the clip  area,  and  <u>W</u>
              and  <u>H</u>  define  the  extents  of  the  area.   A  zero value for <u>W</u> or <u>H</u> will be interpreted as the
              remainder of the image.

       -colors <u>n</u>
              Specify the maximum number of colors to use in the image.  This is a way to  forcibly  reduce  the
              depth of an image.

       -delay <u>secs</u>
              Automatically  advance  to  the  next  image  after <u>secs</u> seconds.  You may want to use the <u>-global</u>
              switch with this command to create a slideshow with multiple images.

       -dither
              Dither a color image to monochrome using a Floyd‐Steinberg dithering algorithm.  This  happens  by
              default  when  viewing  color  images  on a monochrome display.  This is slower than <u>-halftone</u> and
              affects the image accuracy but usually looks much better.

       -foreground <u>color</u>
              Use <u>color</u> as the foreground color instead of black if you are transferring a monochrome image to a
              color display.  This can also be used  to  invert  the  foreground  and  background  colors  of  a
              monochrome image.

       -gamma <u>display_gamma</u>
              Specify  the  gamma correction for the display.  The default value is 1.0, a typical display needs
              2.0 to 2.5.

       -global
              Force the following option to apply to all images rather than one  specific  image.   Local  image
              options will temporarily override any option specified with -global.

       -gray  Convert  an  image  to  grayscale.  This is very useful when displaying colorful images on servers
              with limited color capability.  It can also be used to convert a bitmap  image  into  a  grayscale
              image,  although  the  resulting  image  will be smaller than the original.  The optional spelling
              <u>-grey</u> may also be used.

       -halftone
              Force halftone dithering of a color image when displaying on a monochrome display.  This option is
              ignored on monochrome images.  This dithering algorithm blows an image up by sixteen times; if you
              don't like this, the <u>-dither</u> option will not blow the image up but will take longer to process and
              will be less accurate.

       -idelay <u>secs</u>
              This option is no longer supported due to the addition of <u>-global</u>.  The same functionality can  be
              had with <u>-delay</u>.

       -invert
              Inverts a monochrome image.  This is shorthand for <u>-foreground</u> <u>white</u> <u>-background</u> <u>black</u>.

       -merge Merge  this  image onto the base image after local processing.  The base image is considered to be
              the first image specified or the last  image  that  was  not  preceded  by  <u>-merge</u>.   If  used  in
              conjunction with <u>-at</u> and <u>-clip</u>, very complex images can be built up.  This option is on by default
              for all images if the <u>-onroot</u> or <u>-windowid</u> options are specified.

       -name <u>image_name</u>
              Force  the  next argument to be treated as an image name.  This is useful if the name of the image
              is <u>-dither</u>, for instance.

       -newoptions
              Reset globally-specified options.

       -normalize
              Normalize a color image.

       -rotate <u>degrees</u>
              Rotate the image by <u>degrees</u> clockwise.  The number must be a multiple of 90.

       -shrink
              Shrink an image down to fit on the display.  This is particularly useful with servers that do  not
              support window sizes larger than the physical screen (eg DECWINDOWS servers).

       -smooth
              Smooth a color image.  This reduces blockiness after zooming an image up.  If used on a monochrome
              image,  nothing happens.  This option can take awhile to perform, especially on large images.  You
              may specify more than one <u>-smooth</u> option per image, causing multiple iterations of  the  smoothing
              algorithm.

       -tile  Tile  this  image  (after  any necessary merging or tiling) to create a fullscreen image.  This is
              usually used to create a large background image on which to merge other images.  <u>-geometry</u> can  be
              used to set the new image size to something other than -fullscreen.

       -title <u>title</u>
              Change  the  title  of  the image.  This sets the title bar title if displaying in a window or the
              NIFF file image title if dumping the image.

       -xzoom <u>percentage</u>
              Zoom the X axis of an image by <u>percentage</u>.  A number greater than 100 will expand the  image,  one
              smaller  will compress it.  A zero value will be ignored.  This option, and the related <u>-yzoom</u> are
              useful for correcting the aspect ratio of images to be displayed.

       -yzoom <u>percentage</u>
              Zoom the Y axis of an image by <u>percentage</u>.  See <u>-xzoom</u> for more information.

       -zoom <u>percentage</u>
              Zoom both the X and Y axes by <u>percentage</u>.  See  <u>-xzoom</u>  for  more  information.   Technically  the
              percentage  actually  zoomed  is the square of the number supplied since the zoom is to both axes,
              but I opted for consistency instead of accuracy.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To load the rasterfile "my.image" onto the background and replicate it to fill the entire background:

            xloadimage -onroot my.image

       To center an image on the default root background:

            xloadimage -default -tile my.image

       If using a monochrome display and a color image you will probably want to dither the image for a  cleaner
       (and faster) display:

            xloadimage -default -tile -dither my.image

       To  load  a monochrome image "my.image" onto the background, using red as the foreground color, replicate
       the image, and overlay "another.image" onto it at coordinate (10,10):

            xloadimage -foreground red my.image -at 10,10 another.image

       To center the rectangular region from 10 to 110 along the X axis and from 10 to the height of  the  image
       along the Y axis:

            xloadimage -center -clip 10,10,100,0 my.image

       To double the size of an image:

            xloadimage -zoom 200 my.image

       To halve the size of an image:

            xloadimage -zoom 50 my.image

       To brighten a dark image:

            xloadimage -brighten 150 my.image

       To darken a bright image:

            xloadimage -brighten 50 my.image

</pre><h4><b>HINTS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>GOOD</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>DISPLAYS</b></h4><pre>
       Since  images  are  likely  to  come from a variety of sources, they may be in a variety of aspect ratios
       which may not be supported by your display.  The <u>-xzoom</u> and <u>-yzoom</u> options can  be  used  to  change  the
       aspect  ratio  of an image before display.  If you use these options, it is recommended that you increase
       the size of one of the dimensions instead of shrinking the other, since  shrinking  looses  detail.   For
       instance, many GIF and G3 FAX images have an X:Y ratio of about 2:1.  You can correct this for viewing on
       a  1:1 display with either <u>-xzoom</u> <u>50</u> or <u>-yzoom</u> <u>200</u> (reduce X axis to 50% of its size and expand Y axis to
       200% of its size, respectively) but the latter should be used so no detail is lost in the conversion.

       When zooming color images up you can reduce blockiness with <u>-smooth</u>.   For  zooms  of  300%  or  more,  I
       recommend  two  smoothing passes (although this can take awhile to do on slow machines).  There will be a
       noticeable improvement in the image.

       You can perform image processing on a small portion of an image by loading the image more than  once  and
       using the <u>-merge</u>, <u>-at</u> and <u>-clip</u> options.  Load the image, then merge it with a clipped, processed version
       of  itself.   To brighten a 100x100 rectangular portion of an image located at (50,50), for instance, you
       could type:

            xloadimage my.image -merge -at 50,50 -clip 50,50,100,100 -brighten 150 my.image

       If you're using a display with a small colormap to display colorful images, try using the <u>-gray</u> option to
       convert to grayscale.

</pre><h4><b>PATHS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The file <a href="file:~/.xloadimagerc">~/.xloadimagerc</a> (and optionally a system-wide file) defines a number  of  configuration  options
       that affect xloadimage.

       This  file  is split into three section, the <u>path</u> section, the <u>extension</u> section, and the <u>filter</u> section.
       The sections are identified by typing the section name followed by an equals sign, eg "path =".

       The <u>path</u> statement is used to provide a set of search paths to  use  when  looking  for  an  image  of  a
       specified name.  Separate each path in the list by whitespace (eg one or more spaces, tabs, or newlines).
       The path is searched in the order it is specified.  For example:

         path = <a href="file:~/images">~/images</a> /usr/local/images ~fred

       will  first  look  for  the  image  name  you specified, then look for the name in <a href="file:~/images">~/images</a> (the tilde is
       expanded to the value of $HOME), then in /usr/local/images, then in user  fred's  home  directory.   This
       allows easy use of image repositories.

       The  <u>extension</u>  statement is used to provide a set of default extensions to use when looking for an image
       of a specified name.  Separate each extension in the list by whitespace.  The extensions are searched  in
       the order in which they are specified.  For example:

         extension = .gif .jpg

       If  you  have a file named <u>myimage.gif</u> you could specify the name <u>myimage</u> and xloadimage would append the
       <u>.gif</u> extension automatically.

       The <u>filter</u> statement is used to describe filter programs, such as "uncompress", which are to  be  applied
       to  image  files  automatically.   You specify one filter program and any number of recognized extensions
       following the <u>filter</u> keyword.  For example:

         filter = uncompress .Z

       specifies that the program <u>uncompress</u> should be used as  a  filter  whenever  an  image  file  has  a  .Z
       extension.   By  default filters are provided for compressed (.Z) files and GNU zip (.gz) files.  See the
       <b>FILTERS</b> section for more information on defining your own filters.

       Any text on a line following a hash‐mark (#) is ignored; if you wish  to  use  a  hash‐mark  in  a  path,
       extension, or filter you can escape it using a backslash (\).

       If  you  wish  to  include  white-space  in a filter program name, path, or extension you can enclose the
       entire text in double‐quotes.  For example:

         filter = "gzip -cd" .gz

       Use backslash (\) characters to allow inclusion of double‐quote marks or newlines.

       The following is a sample <a href="file:~/.xloadimagerc">~/.xloadimagerc</a> file:

         # paths to look for images in
         path = /usr/local/images        # system image repository
               <a href="file:~/images">~/images</a>                 # personal images
               /usr/include/X11/bitmaps # standard X bitmaps

         # default extensions for images
         extension = .csun .msun .sun .face .xbm .bm

         # invoke GNU zip if a .z or .zip extension is found
         filter = "gzip -cd" .z .zip

</pre><h4><b>IMAGE</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xloadimage</u> currently supports many common and some uncommon image types, and can create images in several
       formats.  For a complete list use the <u>-supported</u> option.

</pre><h4><b>DUMPING</b> <b>IMAGES</b></h4><pre>
       Several image dumpers are included that can be used to create a new image after loading  and  processing.
       The  NIFF  (Native  Image  File  Format)  is the simplest and creates images that <u>xloadimage</u> can read the
       fastest; it is essentially a copy of the internal image format.

       Some image dumpers allow options that affect the image output.  These options are appended to  the  image
       type  following a comma and are separated by commas.  If a value is desired it can be specified following
       an equals‐sign.  For example, to create a monochrome JPEG image file with a quality  factor  of  80,  you
       would use the following command line:

         xloadimage image_name -dump jpeg,quality=80,grayscale new_image.jpg

       Option  names  can be abbreviated but if the abbreviation is too short to be unique the option which will
       be used is indeterminate.

</pre><h4><b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       Xloadimage supports automatic filtering by recognizing file extensions.  By default "compress" and "gzip"
       files are recognized and their names passed to appropriate commands to decompress them.

       The xloadimage distribution includes a special "smart" uudecoder, called <u>uufilter</u> that  can  be  used  to
       automatically  uudecode  files  for  processing.   <u>Uufilter</u> ignores extraneous lines in the file so it is
       particularly useful if the uuencoded file was created by concatenating email or news  postings  that  had
       headers or line‐break indicators included.

       To make use of <u>uufilter</u> you can add the following to your <u>.xloadimagerc</u> file:

         filter = "uufilter -s" .uu .uue
       The filter will be automatically invoked on any file with a .uu or .uue extension.

       For a list of filters automatically recognized by xloadimage use the <u>-configuration</u> option.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The JPEG image dumper supports the following options:

       arithmetic
               Use arithmetic encoding.

       grayscale
               Force a monochrome (grayscale) image to be created given a color image.

       nointerleave
               Create a non‐interleaved file.

       optimize
               Enable entropy parameter optimization.

       quality Adjust  the  quality  of the image to be created.  The default quality factor is 75; lower values
               create poorer images.

       restart <u>interval</u>
               Set the restart interval in MCU rows, or MCUs if 'b' follows the interval value.

       smooth <u>smoothing_factor</u>
               Set the smoothing factor.  Value should be between 0 and 100, inclusive.

       If you are not familiar with the meaning of these options you can ask the Independent  JPEG  Group  (IJG)
       via email at <a href="mailto:jpeg@cs.columbia.edu">jpeg@cs.columbia.edu</a>.

       The PBM image dumper supports the following options:

       normal  Dump a normal (ascii) PBM/PPM file.

       raw     Dump  a  RawBits  format  PBM/PPM file.  This is the default and results in significantly smaller
               image files than when using <u>normal</u>.

       There is no way to dump a PGM format file or a "compact" PBM format file (sorry).

       The TIFF image dumper supports the following options:

       compression
               Image data compression technique.   Can  be  one  of:  <u>none</u>  (no  compression),  <u>rle</u>  (CCITT  RLE
               compression),  <u>g3fax</u>  (CCITT Group 3 FAX compression), <u>g4fax</u> (CCITT Group 4 FAX compression), <u>lzw</u>
               (Limpel‐Ziv‐Welsh compression, the default),  <u>jpeg</u>  (JPEG  compression),  <u>next</u>  (NeXT  run‐length
               compression), <u>rlew</u> (CCITT RLEW compression), <u>mac</u> (Macintosh PackBits compression), <u>packbits</u> (same
               as <u>mac</u>), <u>thunderscan</u> (ThunderScan compression).

       <u>Xloadimage</u>  will  save using the MINISBLACK, MINISWHITE, COLORMAP, or RGB photometrics as appropriate for
       its internal image format.  There is no way to specify a particular photometric or any other TIFF fields.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Zooming dithered images, especially downwards, is UGLY.

       Images can come in a variety of aspect ratios.  <u>Xloadimage</u> cannot detect what aspect ratio the particular
       image  being loaded has, nor the aspect ratio of the destination display, so images with differing aspect
       ratios from the destination display will appear distorted.  See <u>HINTS</u> <u>FOR</u> <u>GOOD</u> <u>IMAGE</u>  <u>DISPLAYS</u>  for  more
       information.

       The  GIF  format  allows  more than one image to be stored in a single GIF file, but <u>xloadimage</u> will only
       display the first.

       Only GIF87a format is supported.

       One of the pseudonyms for <u>xloadimage</u>, <u>xview</u>, is the same name  as  Sun  uses  for  their  SunView‐under‐X
       package.  This will be confusing if you're one of those poor souls who has to use Sun's XView.

       Some  window  managers do not correctly handle window size requests.  In particular, many versions of the
       twm window manager use the MaxSize hint instead of the PSize hint, causing images which are  larger  than
       the  screen  to  display  in  a window larger than the screen, something which is normally avoided.  Some
       versions of twm also ignore the MaxSize argument's real function,  to  limit  the  maximum  size  of  the
       window,  and  allow  the  window to be resized larger than the image.  If this happens, <u>xloadimage</u> merely
       places the image in the upper‐left corner of the window and uses the zero‐value'ed pixel  for  any  space
       which  is not covered by the image.  This behavior is less‐than‐graceful but so are window managers which
       are cruel enough to ignore such details.
