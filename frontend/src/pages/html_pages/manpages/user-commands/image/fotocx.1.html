       Fotocx - photo/image editor and collection manager

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Organize  and  manage  a  large  image collection. Edit and optimize photos and other images, add special
       effects, edit metadata, search images, create a photomontage, perform batch operations. Fotocx is  a  GTK
       GUI application.  The included user manual explains Fotocx operation in great detail.

</pre><h4><b>LONG</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Fotocx is a free Linux program for editing photos or other images and managing a large collection. Fotocx
       has powerful editing tools to correct and enhance photos. Fotocx can instantly find desired images within
       a  huge  collection,  based on file/folder names or embedded metadata such as date, tags/keywords, title,
       description, rating, location ... any metadata.
       Image folders can be viewed as a scrolling gallery  of  thumbnail  images.   Navigation  of  folders  and
       subfolders  is  simple  and fast. Click a thumbnail for a full window view of the image. The image can be
       zoomed, panned and scrolled using the mouse. Gallery thumbnails can  vary  from  small  to  huge.   Popup
       windows  can  be used to view or compare multiple images at any scale.  Thumbnail galleries are also used
       for image search results and albums.  Albums are selected images arranged in a desired order. Fotocx  has
       many  editing  tools  that go beyond the basics. Images with severe problems (underexposed, false colors,
       blurred, uneven lighting, fog/haze) can be brought back to life. Details lost in shadows or haze  can  be
       brought out.  Images with distorted perspective (esp. wide-angle views) can be corrected.
       Fotocx  is  standards compliant. Nothing done by Fotocx makes images less usable with other applications.
       Fotocx uses your image files wherever they are: they are not moved or duplicated. Fotocx does  create  an
       index for fast image searching, and thumbnail images for fast gallery displays. These add typically 2% to
       overall storage requirements. There is no database to manage - the index manages itself.
       Fotocx  can  import  RAW  images  and  perform  all  processing  in  deep  color  (24 bits per color used
       internally). Edited images can be saved as JPEG, TIFF (8/16 bits/color),  or  PNG  (8/16  bits).  Convert
       single RAW files or selected batches (click thumbnails from gallery pages).
       Image edit functions are interactive with rapid visual feedback, using the full image or a chosen zoom-in
       area.  Undo and Redo can be applied serially to all the edits of an image. Intermediate and final results
       can be saved as new files or as new versions (e.g. filename.v02.jpg).
       Areas within an image can be selected and edited separately from the background. Areas  can  be  selected
       using  several  methods: drag the mouse to select and flood into matching tones, follow feature edges, or
       outline an area freehand. Complex feature edges, such as hair or foliage,  can  be  accurately  selected.
       Selected areas can be copied and pasted into the same or other images, resized, rotated, brightened, etc.
       Layers are not used. Each edit step can be saved separately as a file
       An image can be "mouse painted" onto another image. Paint from a chosen source image location to a chosen
       destination, with optional rescale.
       Batch  functions are available to copy, move, rename, resize, upright, convert format, convert RAW files,
       and add or revise metadata.
       Several tools are available to change size and shape: crop, rescale, rotate, fix perspective,  curve/warp
       the whole image or selected areas within the image. There is a special tool to 'flatten' photos of curved
       surfaces, e.g. a page from a thick book or a poster on a round column.
       Text  can  be  added  to an image. Any font and size can be used, any color, any angle. The text can have
       variable transparency, an outline, a shadow, or an embossed effect - good for a signature  or  copyright.
       Other basic markups are available: lines, arrows, box, oval/circle.
       Advanced  edit  functions:  Dust  spots from old slides or photos can be removed, roadside trash or power
       lines can be erased. Panoramas can  be  made  by  stitching  photos  together  seamlessly,  automatically
       matching  brightness  and color. Photos with a range of exposure values can be combined into an HDR image
       with adjustable contributions. Photos with varying focus depths can be combined into  an  image  that  is
       sharp  over  the combined range. Photos of one scene taken at different moments can be combined to remove
       passing autos or tourists. Multiple photos made under low light conditions  can  be  combined  to  reduce
       noise.  Images  and  text can be combined into a mashup (montage), using the mouse to position and resize
       the components and adjust overlaps and transparencies.
       Fotocx has a batch scripting tool to speed the processing of multiple images requiring  the  same  edits:
       record  the edits made to a base image and then apply these edits automatically to any number of selected
       images.
       Many special effects ('filters') are available to convert a photo into a line drawing, sketch,  painting,
       embossing, cartoon, dithered image, mosaic, or abstract patterns. Background patterns and textures can be
       added.
       Images  can  be  rapidly  searched  using  file  and folder names or partial names, dates, assigned tags,
       ratings, locations, and any other metadata stored in the image. Some data is automatic  from  the  camera
       (date,  location,  exposure  data),  and other data can be manually entered (tags, captions ...).  Search
       criteria can be used in combination; e.g.  find  Chicago  photos  for  years  2008-2020  containing  tags
       'Barbara' or 'Barbie'.
       Locations  (from a camera GPS sensor or entered manually) can also be searched. You can view a map of any
       region in the world, at any scale, using an internet map service. Images having  location  data  show  as
       markers  on these maps. Click a marker to get a gallery of the corresponding images.  You can jump from a
       given photo to its location on a world map, where you can find other  photos  from  the  same  or  nearby
       locations.
       Albums  can  be  made  using  selected  images from your collection. The files are not duplicated. Select
       images by clicking gallery thumbnails. Arrange the images with drag and drop. Albums  can  be  made  into
       slide  shows.  Choose animated transitions between images, pan and zoom effects, and places to auto-pause
       for narration.
       Fotocx includes a comprehensive user manual, also used for interactive help: press  F1  while  using  any
       function  in  Fotocx to see the corresponding topic. You should take the time to read the overview pages.
       The function details can be viewed as needed using F1.
