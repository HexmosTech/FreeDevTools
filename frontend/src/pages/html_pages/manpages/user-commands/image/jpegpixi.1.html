</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       jpegpixi - interpolate pixels in JFIF (JPEG) image files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jpegpixi</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... <u>SOURCE</u> <u>DEST</u> [[<u>D</u>:]<u>X</u>,<u>Y</u>[,<u>S</u>]|[,<u>SX</u>,<u>SY</u>]]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Jpegpixi  interpolates  pixels  or  pixel  blocks  in  JFIF  images  files (commonly referred to as "JPEG
       images"). This is useful to correct images from a digital camera with CCD defects. Only DCT blocks  which
       contain  pixels  to  be  interpolated  are  decoded and re-encoded, and the re-encoding is performed with
       exactly the same parameters with which the image  has  originally  been  encoded.  Therefore,  the  image
       quality is preserved as much as possible.

       <u>SOURCE</u>  and  <u>DEST</u>  are  the  filenames of the source file and the destination file, respectively. In both
       cases, <b>-</b> can be used, which refers to standard input or standard output.

       The destination filename is followed by any number of pixel or pixel block specifications. It starts with
       an optional direction specifier (<u>D</u>), which can be <b>2</b> for 2-dimensional interpolation (the default), <b>V</b> or <b>v</b>
       for 1-dimensional vertical interpolation (e.g. to remove horizontal stripes), or <b>H</b> or <b>h</b> for 1-dimensional
       horizontal interpolation.  <u>X</u>,<u>Y</u> are the coordinates of the pixel or the upper-left  corner  of  the  pixel
       block.   <u>S</u>  is the size of the pixel block (1 by default). Alternatively, separate sizes can be specified
       for the width (<u>SX</u>) and the height (<u>SY</u>).

       All numbers (<u>X</u>, <u>Y</u>, <u>S</u>, <u>SX</u>, <u>SY</u>) can be expressed as absolute coordinates/sizes or percentages of the  image
       size. If a number is followed by a percent character (<b>%</b>), it is interpreted as a percentage, otherwise as
       an absolute number.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f</b> <u>FILE</u>, <b>--blocks-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Read  pixel  block  specifications from file <u>FILE</u> in addition to the command line. The file should
              contain one specification ([<u>D</u>:]<u>X</u>,<u>Y</u>[,<u>S</u>]|[,<u>SX</u>,<u>SY</u>]) per line. Empty lines are ignored. The  file  may
              also contain comments, which start with an octothorpe (<b>#</b>) and extend to the end of the line.

       <b>-m</b> <u>METHOD</u>, <b>--method</b>=<u>METHOD</u>
              Use interpolation method <u>METHOD</u> (default: <b>linear</b>).  See section INTERPOLATION METHODS below.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Display the coordinates and size of each pixel block that is interpolated.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--info</b>
              Display  information about the image, such as the size of the image, the colorspace in which it is
              encoded, and sampling rates for the different components.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--strip</b>
              Do not copy comment and extra markers from the source to the destination file. This strips preview
              images, EXIF data, and similar information.

       <b>--help</b> Display a short help text and exit immediately.

       <b>--version</b>
              Display version information and exit immediately.

</pre><h4><b>INTERPOLATION</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>0</b>, <b>av</b>, <b>average</b>
              The pixels adjacent to the pixel block are averaged. The resulting color is assigned to all pixels
              in the block. For 1-dimensional interpolation,  this  is  done  separately  for  one  pixel  wide,
              horizontal or vertical stripes.

       <b>1</b>, <b>li</b>, <b>linear</b>
              The  pixels  which  have  a  distance  of  1 from the pixel block are used to calculate a bilinear
              surface (2-dim), or a group of linear curves (1-dim), which is then used to assign colors  to  the
              pixels in the block.

       <b>2</b>, <b>qu</b>, <b>quadratic</b>
              The  pixels  which  have  a  distance  of  2  or less from the pixel block are used to calculate a
              biquadratic surface (2-dim), or a group of quadratic curves (1-dim), which is then used to  assign
              colors to the pixels in the block.

       <b>3</b>, <b>cu</b>, <b>cubic</b>
              The pixels which have a distance of 3 or less from the pixel block are used to calculate a bicubic
              surface  (2-dim),  or  a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to assign colors to the
              pixels in the block.
