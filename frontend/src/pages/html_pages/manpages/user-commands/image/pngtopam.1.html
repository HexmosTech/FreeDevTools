       pngtopam - convert a PNG image into a Netpbm image

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pngtopam</b>  [<b>-verbose</b>]  [<b>-alphapam</b>  |  <b>-alpha</b>  |  <b>-mix</b>] [<b>-background</b>=<u>color</u>] [<b>-gamma</b>=<u>value</u>] [<b>-text</b>=<u>filename</u>]
       [<b>-time</b>] [<b>-byrow</b>] [<u>pngfile</u>]

       Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use double hyphens instead of single hyphen
       to denote options.  You may use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option  name  from
       its value.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pngtopam</b>  reads  a  PNG image (Portable Network Graphics) as input and produces a Netpbm image as output.
       The type of the output file depends on the input file - if it's black &amp; white,  <b>pngtopam</b>  creates  a  PBM
       file.   If  it's  grayscale, <b>pngtopam</b> creates a PGM file.  Otherwise, it creates a PPM file.  Except that
       with the <b>-alphapam</b> option, it always creates a PAM file.  That file has  tuple  type  GRAYSCALE_ALPHA  or
       RGB_ALPHA depending on whether the input has color or not.

       To  convert  in  the other direction, use <b>pamtopng</b> or <b>pnmtopng</b>.  The former is the more modern of the two
       and can recognize transparency information in a PAM file, as you might generate with <b>pngtopam</b>  <b>-alphapam</b>.
       It  has existed only since June 2015.  The latter has more features, but probably not ones that matter in
       the modern world.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably  <b>-quiet</b>,  see   Common
       Options ), <b>pngtopam</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       <b>-verbose</b>
              Display various information about the input PNG image and the conversion process.

              If you want even more information about the PNG image, use <b>pngcheck</b> (not part of Netpbm).

       <b>-alphapam</b>
              Produce  a single output image containing the main image (foreground) and the transparency channel
              or transparency mask.  This image is in the PAM format with tuple type of  either  GRAYSCALE_ALPHA
              (which has a depth of 2 channels) or RGB_ALPHA (which has a depth of 4 channels).

              You  can specify only one of <b>-alphapam</b>, <b>-alpha</b>, and <b>-mix</b>.  With none of them, <b>pngtopam</b> produces an
              image of the foreground of the input image and discards transparency information.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.44 (September 2008).

       <b>-alpha</b> Output the transparency channel or transparency mask of the image. The result is either a PBM file
              or a PGM file, depending on whether different levels of transparency appear.

              <b>pngtopam</b> discards the main image (the foreground).

              You can specify only one of <b>-alphapam</b>, <b>-alpha</b>, and <b>-mix</b>.  With none of them, <b>pngtopam</b> produces  an
              image of the foreground of the input image and discards transparency information.

       <b>-mix</b>   Compose the image with the transparency or transparency mask against a background.  The background
              color  is  determined  by  the  bKGD  chunk  in  the  PNG,  except  that  you can override it with
              <b>-background</b>.  If the PNG has no bKGD chunk and you don't specify <b>-background</b>, the background color
              is white.

              You can specify only one of <b>-alphapam</b>, <b>-alpha</b>, and <b>-mix</b>.  With none of them, <b>pngtopam</b> produces  an
              image of the foreground of the input image and discards transparency information.

       <b>-background=</b><u>color</u>
              This option specifies the background color with which to mix the image when you specify <b>-mix</b>.

              <u>color</u> is as described for the argument of the <b>pnm_parsecolor()</b> library routine .

              Examples:

       •      -background=rgb:01/ff/80

       •      -background=rgbi:1/255/128

              If  you don't specify <b>-background</b>, the background color is what is specified in the PNG image, and
              if the PNG doesn't specify anything, white.

              You cannot specify <b>-background</b> unless you also specify <b>-mix</b>.  Before Netpbm  10.27  (March  2005),
              you  could  specify  <b>-background</b>  without  <b>-mix</b> and it was just ignored.  (This caused a usability
              problem).

       <b>-gamma=</b><u>value</u>
              This option causes <b>pngtopam</b> to respect the image gamma information in the PNG file (from the  gAMA
              chunk).   Probably  by historical accident, <b>pngtopam</b> ignores that information by default, assuming
              the image uses the same gamma transformation as a Netpbm image, so the output image has  different
              colors than the PNG file actually represents if the PNG doesn't actually do that.  (However, it is
              rare  for a PNG file to use a gamma transformation different from what the Netpbm formats specify,
              or if it does, to specify with a gAMA chuck what that is).

              But when you <u>do</u> specify  <b>-gamma</b>,  you  get  a  rather  strange  additional  function,  probably  a
              historical mistake: <b>pngtopam</b> incorporates the specified screen gamma value into the output pixels,
              so  that  the  samples  in the Netpbm output deviate from the Netpbm format specifications and are
              appropriate raw intensity values to send to the display.  This function essentially just exercises
              the ability of the PNG library to make gamma corrections to the pixels as it reads them  from  the
              PNG  file  to  produce  values  appropriate  for  sending  to a certain display in certain viewing
              conditions.  It's a strange function because it has nothing to do with PNG and because in  Netpbm,
              the  normal  way to make gamma corrections appropriate for sending to a ceratin display in certain
              viewing conditions is with the program <b>pngtopam</b>, applied to the normal output of <b>pngtopam</b>.

              If you specify <b>-gamma</b>, but the PNG image does not specify what gamma transformation it uses (there
              is no gAMA chunk), <b>pngtopam</b> assumes a simple power transformation with  an  image  gamma  of  1.0.
              That is probably not not the actual image gamma; it is much more likely to be .45.

              Because  the  gammas  of uncompensated monitors are around 2.6, which results in an image-gamma of
              0.45, some typical situations are: when the image-gamma is 0.45 (use -verbose to  check)  and  the
              picture  is too light, your system is gamma-corrected, so convert with "-gamma 1.0".  When no gAMA
              chunk is present or the image-gamma is 1.0, use 2.2 to make the picture lighter and 0.45  to  make
              the picture darker.

              One oddity to be aware of when using <b>-gamma</b> on an image with transparency: The PNG image specifies
              that  a  certain color is transparent, i.e. every pixel in the image of that color is transparent.
              But <b>pngtopam</b> interprets this as applying to the gamma-corrected  space,  and  there  may  be  less
              precision  in  that space than in the original, which means multiple uncorrected colors map to the
              same corrected color.  So imagine that the image contains 3 shades of white (gray)  and  specifies
              that   one   of   them   is   transparent.    After  gamma  correction,  those  three  shades  are
              indistinguishable, so <b>pngtopam</b> considers pixels of all three shades to be transparent.

       <b>-text=</b><u>file</u>
              Writes the tEXt and zTXt chunks to a file, in a format as described in the <b>pnmtopng</b>  user  manual.
              These chunks contain text comments or annotations.

       <b>-time</b>  Prints the tIME chunk to stderr.

       <b>-byrow</b> This option can make <b>pngtopam</b> run faster or in environments where it would otherwise fail.

              <b>pngtopam</b>  has  two ways to do the conversion from PNG to PAM, using respectively two facilities of
              the PNG library:

       Whole Image
              Decode the entire image into memory at once, using  <b>png_read_image()</b>,  then  convert  to  PAM  and
              output row by row.

       Row By Row
              Read, convert, and output one row at a time using <b>png_read_row()</b>.

              Whole  Image is generally preferable because the PNG library does more of the work, which means it
              understands more of the PNG format possibilities now and in the  future.   Also,  if  the  PNG  is
              interlaced, <b>pngtopam</b> does not know how to assemble the rows in the right order.

              Row  By  Row uses far less memory, which means with large images, it can run in environments where
              Whole Image cannot and may also run faster.  And because Netpbm code does more of the  work,  it's
              possible  that  it  can be more flexible or at least give better diagnostic information if there's
              something wrong with the PNG.

              The Netpbm native code may do something correctly that the PNG library does incorrectly,  or  vice
              versa.

              In  Netpbm, we stress function over performance, so by default <b>pngtopam</b> uses Whole Image.  You can
              select Row By Row with <b>-byrow</b> if you want the speed or resource requirement improvement.

              <b>-byrow</b> was new in Netpbm 10.54 (March 2011).

       <b>-orientraw</b>
              A TIFF stream contains raster data which can  be  arranged  in  the  stream  various  ways.   Most
              commonly, it is arranged by rows, with the top row first, and the pixels left to right within each
              row, but many other orientations are possible.

              The  common  orientation is the same on the Netpbm formats use, so <b>tifftopnm</b> can do its jobs quite
              efficiently when the TIFF raster is oriented that way.

              But if the TIFF raster is oriented any other way, it can take a considerable amount of  processing
              for <b>tifftopnm</b> to convert it to Netpbm format.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       A  PNG  image  contains a lot of information that can't be represented in Netpbm formats.  Therefore, you
       lose information when you convert  to  another  format  with  "pngtopam  |  pnmtoxxx".   If  there  is  a
       specialized  converter that converts directly to the other format, e.g. <b>ptot</b> to convert from PNG to TIFF,
       you'll get better results using that.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There could be an option to include PNG comment chunks in the output image as  PNM  comments  instead  of
       putting them in a separate file.

       The  program  could  be  much  faster,  with a bit of code optimizing.  As with any Netpbm program, speed
       always takes a back seat to quick present and future development.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pngtopam</b> was new in Netpbm 10.44, as a replacement for <b>pngtopnm</b>.  The main improvement over <b>pngtopnm</b>  was
       that  it could generate a PAM image with a transparency channel, whereas with <b>pngtopnm</b>, you would have to
       extract the transparency channel as a separate file, in a separate run.

       <b>pngtopnm</b> was new in Netpbm 8.1 (March 2000), the first big change to the package in Netpbm's renaissance.
       It and <b>pnmtopng</b> were simply copied from the  <b>pnmtopng</b> package" (1) by Greg Roelofs.  Those were based  on
       simpler  reference  applications  by  Alexander  Lehmann  &lt;<a href="mailto:alex@hal.rhein-main.de">alex@hal.rhein-main.de</a>&gt;  and Willem van Schaik
       &lt;<a href="mailto:willem@schaik.com">willem@schaik.com</a>&gt; and distributed with their PNG library.

       Nearly all of the code has changed since it was copied from the <b>pnmtopng</b> package,  most  of  it  just  to
       improve maintainability.
