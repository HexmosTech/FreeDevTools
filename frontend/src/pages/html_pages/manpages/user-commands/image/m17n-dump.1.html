</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       m17n-dump - dump text image

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       m17n-dump [ OPTION ... ] [ FILE ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Dump a text as PNG image file.

       The PNG file is written to a file created in the current directory with the name 'BASE.png' where BASE is
       the basename of FILE. If FILE is omitted, text is read from standard input, and the image is dumped into
       the file 'output.png'.

       The following OPTIONs are available.

       • -s SIZE

       SIZE is the font size in point. The default font size is 12 point.

       • -d DPI

       DPI is the resolution in dots per inch. The default resolution is 300 dpi.

       • -p PAPER

       PAPER  is  the  paper size: a4, a4r, a5, a5r, b5, b5r, letter, WxH, or W. In the case of WxH, W and H are
       the width and height in millimeter. In the case of W, W is the width in millimeter.  If  this  option  is
       specified,  PAPER  limits the image size. If FILE is too large for a single page, multiple files with the
       names 'BASE.01.png', 'BASE.02.png', etc. are created.

       • -m MARGIN

       MARGIN is the horizontal and vertical margin in millimeter. The default margin is 20 mm.  It  is  ignored
       when PAPER is not specified.

       • -c POS

       POS is the character position of cursor to draw. By default, cursor is not drawn.

       • -x

       FILE  is  assumed  to be an XML file generated by the serialize facility of the m17n library, and FILE is
       deserialized before an image is created.

       • -w

       Each line is broken at word boundary.

       • -f FILTER

       FILTER is a string containing a shell command line. If this option is specified, the  PNG  image  is  not
       written  info  a  file  but  is  given to FILTER as standard input. If FILTER contains '%s', that part is
       replaced by a basename of FILE. So, the default behaviour is the same as specifying 'cat &gt;
           %s.png' as FILTER.

       If FILTER is just '-', the PNG image is written to stdout.

       • -a

       Enable anti-alias drawing.

       • --family FAMILY

       Prefer a font whose family name is FAMILY.

       • --language LANG

       Prefer a font specified for the language LANG. LANG must be a 2-letter code of ISO  630  (e.g.  'en'  for
       English).

       • -fg FOREGROUND

       Specify the text color. The supported color names are those of HTML 4.0 and '#RRGGBB' notation.

       • -bg BACKGROUND

       Specify  the  background  color.  The  supported  color  names are the same as FOREGROUND, except that if
       'transparent' is specified, make the background transparent.

       • -r

       Specify that the orientation of the text is right-to-left.

       • -q

       Quiet mode. Don't print any messages.

       • --version

       Print the version number.

       • -h, --help

       Print this message.
