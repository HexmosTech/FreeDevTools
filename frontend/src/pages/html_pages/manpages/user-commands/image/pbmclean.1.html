       pbmclean - despeckle a PBM image

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pbmclean</b> [<b>-minneighbors=</b><u>N</u>] [<b>-black</b>|<b>-white</b>] [<b>-extended</b>] [<u>pbmfile</u>]

</pre><h4><b>OPTION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       You can use the minimum unique abbreviation of the options.  You can use two hyphens instead of one.  You
       can separate an option name from its value with white space instead of an equals sign.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pbmclean</b> cleans up a PBM image of random specks.  It reads a PBM image as input and outputs a PBM that is
       the same as the input except with isolated pixels inverted.

       You can use <b>pbmclean</b>  to clean up "snow" on bitmap images.

       There  are  two  ways  <b>pbmclean</b>  can  define  "isolated"  pixels:  simple and extended.  When you specify
       <b>-extended</b>, <b>pbmclean</b> uses extended; otherwise it uses basic.

   <b>Basic</b> <b>Mode</b>
       In basic mode, <b>pbmclean</b> looks at each pixel individually, and any pixel that  doesn't  have  at  least  a
       minimum number of pixels of the same color touching it is considered isolated and <b>pbmclean</b> erases it.

       The <b>-minneighbors</b> option specifies the minimum number of neighboring pixels of the same color for a pixel
       <u>not</u> to be considered isolated.

       For  example,  if  <b>-minneighbors</b>  is  two and there are two contiguous black pixels in an otherwise white
       field, each of those pixels is isolated, so <b>pbmclean</b> erases them - turns both white.

       The default minimum 1 pixel - <b>pbmclean</b> flips only completely isolated pixels.

       (A <b>-minneighbors</b> value greater than 8 generates a completely inverted image  (but  use  <b>pnminvert</b>  to  do
       that) -- or a completely white or completely black image with the <b>-black</b> or <b>-white</b> option).

       <b>pbmclean</b>  considers  the area beyond the edges of the image to be white.  (This matters when you consider
       pixels right on the edge of the image).

       <b>pbmclean</b> does not distinguish between foreground and background; by default, it flips isolated pixels  of
       either color.  But you can specify <b>-black</b> or <b>-white</b> to have it flip only pixels of one color.

   <b>Extended</b> <b>Mode</b>
       In  extended  mode, <b>pbmclean</b> erases all blobs which don't have the specified minimum number of pixels.  A
       blob is a set of contiguous pixels of the foreground color.  The minimum number of pixels is one plus the
       <b>-minneighbors</b> value.  You specify the foreground color with <b>-black</b> and <b>-white</b> (default is black).

       For example, if <b>-minneighbors</b> is 2 and the foreground color is black, and the image contains  a  straight
       line  4  pixels long, <b>pbmclean</b> erases that -- turns all four pixels white.  <b>pbmclean</b> also erases 4 pixels
       in a square or L-shape.

       The default <b>-minneighbors</b> is 4, so a blob must have at least 5 pixels to escape <b>pbmclean</b>'s purge.

       Extended mode was new in Netpbm 10.56 (September 2011).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably  <b>-quiet</b>,  see   Common
       Options ), <b>pbmclean</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       <b>-black</b>

       <b>-white</b> Flip  pixels  of  the  specified  color.   By  default,  if you specify neither <b>-black</b> nor <b>-white</b>,
              <b>pbmclean</b> flips both black and white pixels which do not have sufficient identical  neighbors.   If
              you  specify <b>-black</b>, <b>pbmclean</b> leaves the white pixels alone and just erases isolated black pixels.
              Vice versa for <b>-white</b>.  You may specify both <b>-black</b> and <b>-white</b> to get  the  same  as  the  default
              behavior.

       <b>-minneighbors=</b><u>N</u>
              This  determines  how  many  pixels  must  be  in a cluster in order for <b>pbmclean</b> to consider them
              legitimate and not clean them out of the image.  See Description .

              Before December 2001, <b>pbmclean</b> accepted <b>-</b><u>N</u> instead of <b>-minneighbors</b>.  Before Netpbm  10.27  (March
              2005), <b>-minneighbors</b> was <b>-minneighbor</b>.

       <b>-extended</b>
              <b>pbmclean</b> uses extended, as opposed to basic, isolated pixel detection.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.56 (September 2011).
