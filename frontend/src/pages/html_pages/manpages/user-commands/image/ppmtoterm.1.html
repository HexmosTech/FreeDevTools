</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ppmtoterm - convert a PPM image to a ANSI ISO 6429 ascii image

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ppmtoterm</b>

       [<u>ppmfile</u>]

       All  options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You may use two hyphens instead of one.
       You may separate an option name and its value with white space instead of an equals sign.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       This program tries to produce an accurate representation of a PPM image on an  terminal  that  implements
       the  ANSI  ISO 6429 standard.  It approximates colors, finding the minimum Cartesian distance between the
       input RGB vectors and the ones in the generated palette.  As the  available  color  palette  is  somewhat
       restricted,  you  get  the  best  results  when  the  colors  in  the  original image are few and the RGB
       intensities are close to zero, half of maximum, and maximum.

       You can usually get good results with cartoons or images with plain colors (no gradients).  With  photos,
       results can vary, but are usually not very accurate.

       The output image has one line for each row and one character for each column of the input image.  E.g. an
       80  pixel  by  25 pixel PPM image would fill up an 80x25 terminal screen.  Use <b>pamscale</b> or <b>pamcut</b> to make
       your image fit properly on your screen.

       Furthermore, use <b>pamscale</b> to recover the proper aspect ratio, because a character on a terminal screen is
       rarely square.  Typically, a character is twice has high as it is wide, so in order for a 20x20 image  to
       appear  square  on  your  terminal,  as  it  should,  you'll  want  to squash it vertically or stretch it
       horizontally by a factor of two (resulting int 10x20 characters are 20x40 characters).

       The image starts at the current cursor position on the terminal screen.  Each successive  row  starts  at
       Column  0 on the screen.  If you want to shift the image up or down, for example to center it, use <b>pnmpad</b>
       on the input.

       This program was born with the objective of displaying nice color images on the  Linux  console,  e.g.  a
       proper logo at Linux boot.

       <b>ppmtoascii</b>  does  a  similar  things,  but combines 2 or 8 pixels into one character, where the character
       roughly represents those particular pixels, whereas <b>ppmtoterm</b> displays each character of the image  as  a
       single pixel.

       <b>pbmto4425</b>  does  a  similar  thing  for  black  and  white images, using line drawing characters, on some
       terminals.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are no command line options defined specifically for  <b>ppmtoterm</b>,  but  it  recognizes  the  options
       common to all programs based on libnetpbm (See  Common Options .)
