       wimexport - Export image(s) from a WIM archive

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wimexport</b> <u>SRC_WIMFILE</u> <u>SRC_IMAGE</u> <u>DEST_WIMFILE</u>
        [<u>DEST_IMAGE_NAME</u> [<u>DEST_IMAGE_DESC</u>]] [<u>OPTION</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wimexport</b>,  or  equivalently  <b>wimlib-imagex</b>  <b>export</b>,  exports  the  specified image from <u>SRC_WIMFILE</u> into
       <u>DEST_WIMFILE</u>, optionally changing the image's name and/or description.  If <u>DEST_WIMFILE</u>  already  exists,
       the  image  will  be appended to it; otherwise, a new WIM archive will be created to contain the exported
       image.

       <u>SRC_IMAGE</u> specifies the image in <u>SRC_WIMFILE</u> to export.  It may be the 1-based index  of  an  image,  the
       name  of an image, or the keyword "all" to specify all images.  You can use <b><a href="../man1/wiminfo.1.html">wiminfo</a></b>(1) to list the images
       contained in <u>SRC_WIMFILE</u>.

       If specified, <u>DEST_IMAGE_NAME</u> is the name to give the image being exported.  The default is its  name  in
       <u>SRC_WIMFILE</u>.   If  specified,  <u>DEST_IMAGE_NAME</u> must be either a name not already used in <u>DEST_WIMFILE</u>, or
       the empty string to leave the image unnamed.  <u>DEST_IMAGE_NAME</u> cannot be specified  if  "all"  images  are
       being exported.

       If  specified,  <u>DEST_IMAGE_DESC</u>  is the description to give the image being exported.  The default is its
       description in <u>SRC_WIMFILE</u>.

       <b>wimexport</b> supports exporting images from stand-alone WIMs as well as from split WIMs and delta WIMs.  See
       <b>SPLIT</b> <b>WIMS</b>.

       <b>wimexport</b> also supports exporting images from a non-pipable WIM into a pipable WIM or vice versa, or from
       a non-solid WIM into a solid WIM or vice versa.  It can also export a pipable WIM  directly  to  standard
       output if <u>DEST_WIMFILE</u> is specified as "-"; see <b>--pipable</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--boot</b>
             Mark  the  exported  image  as  the  "bootable"  image of the WIM; or, if multiple images are being
             exported, make the image that was the bootable image of the source WIM also the bootable  image  of
             the destination WIM.

       <b>--check</b>
             Before  exporting  the  image(s),  verify the integrity of the source WIM, destination WIM, and any
             referenced WIMs whenever they  have  extra  integrity  information  present.   Also  include  extra
             integrity information in the destination WIM, even if it was not present before.

       <b>--nocheck</b>
             Do not include extra integrity information in the destination WIM, even if it was present before.

       <b>--include-integrity</b>
             Include  extra  integrity  information  in  the destination WIM, i.e. like <b>--check</b> but don't do any
             verification beforehand.

       <b>--compress</b>=<u>TYPE</u>[:<u>LEVEL</u>]
             Specify the compression type, and optionally the compression level for that compression  type,  for
             <u>DEST_WIMFILE</u>.   Note  that  if  <u>DEST_WIMFILE</u>  already  exists,  then its compression type cannot be
             changed by this option.  See the documentation for this option to <b><a href="../man1/wimcapture.1.html">wimcapture</a></b>(1) for more details.

       <b>--chunk-size</b>=<u>SIZE</u>
             Set the WIM compression chunk size to <u>SIZE</u>.  See the documentation for this option to <b><a href="../man1/wimcapture.1.html">wimcapture</a></b>(1)
             for more details.

       <b>--recompress</b>
             Force all exported data to be  recompressed,  even  if  the  destination  WIM  will  use  the  same
             compression type as the source WIM.

       <b>--solid</b>
             Create  a  "solid"  archive  that  compresses  multiple  files together.  This usually results in a
             significantly better compression ratio but has disadvantages such as  reduced  compatibility.   See
             the documentation for this option to <b><a href="../man1/wimcapture.1.html">wimcapture</a></b>(1) for more details.

       <b>--solid-compress</b>=<u>TYPE</u>[:<u>LEVEL</u>]
             Like  <b>--compress</b>,  but set the compression type used in solid resources.  See the documentation for
             this option to <b><a href="../man1/wimcapture.1.html">wimcapture</a></b>(1) for more details.

       <b>--solid-chunk-size</b>=<u>SIZE</u>
             Like <b>--chunk-size</b>, but set the chunk size used in solid resources.  See the documentation for  this
             option to <b><a href="../man1/wimcapture.1.html">wimcapture</a></b>(1) for more details.

       <b>--threads</b>=<u>NUM_THREADS</u>
             Number of threads to use for compressing data.  Default: autodetect (number of processors).

       <b>--rebuild</b>
             If  exporting to an existing WIM, rebuild it rather than appending to it.  Rebuilding is slower but
             will save some space that would otherwise be left as a hole in the WIM.  Also see <b><a href="../man1/wimoptimize.1.html">wimoptimize</a></b>(1).

       <b>--ref</b>="<u>GLOB</u>"
             File glob of additional WIMs or split WIM parts to reference resources from.  See <b>SPLIT_WIMS</b>.  This
             option can be specified multiple times.  Note: <u>GLOB</u> is listed in quotes because it  is  interpreted
             by <b>wimexport</b> and may need to be quoted to protect against shell expansion.

       <b>--pipable</b>
             Build  or rebuild <u>DEST_WIMFILE</u> as a "pipable WIM" that can be applied fully sequentially, including
             from a pipe.  See <b><a href="../man1/wimcapture.1.html">wimcapture</a></b>(1) for more details about creating pipable WIMs.  The default  without
             this option is to make <u>DEST_WIMFILE</u> pipable only if it was "-" (standard output) or was an existing
             pipable WIM.

       <b>--not-pipable</b>
             Rebuild  <u>DEST_WIMFILE</u> as a normal, non-pipable WIM.  This only useful if you are exporting image(s)
             to a pipable WIM but you want it rebuilt as non-pipable.

       <b>--wimboot</b>
             Mark the destination image as WIMBoot-compatible.  Also, if exporting to a  new  archive,  set  the
             compression type to that recommended for WIMBoot (currently, XPRESS with 4096 byte chunks).

       <b>--unsafe-compact</b>
             Compact  the  existing destination WIM in-place and append any new data, eliminating "holes".  This
             is efficient, but in general this option should  <u>not</u>  be  used  because  a  failed  or  interrupted
             compaction  will  corrupt  the  WIM  archive.  For more information, see the documentation for this
             option to <b><a href="../man1/wimoptimize.1.html">wimoptimize</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>SPLIT</b> <b>WIMS</b></h4><pre>
       You may use <b>wimexport</b> to export images from (but not to) a split  WIM.   The  <u>SRC_WIMFILE</u>  argument  must
       specify the first part of the split WIM, while the additional parts of the split WIM must be specified in
       one  or  more  <b>--ref</b>="<u>GLOB</u>"  options.   Since globbing is built into the <b>--ref</b> option, typically only one
       <b>--ref</b> option is necessary.  For example, the names for the split WIM parts usually go something like:

              mywim.swm
              mywim2.swm
              mywim3.swm
              mywim4.swm
              mywim5.swm

       To export the first image of this split WIM to a new or existing WIM file
       "other.wim", run:

              wimexport mywim.swm 1 other.wim --ref="mywim*.swm"

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Data</u> <u>consistency</u>: Except when using <b>--unsafe-compact</b>, it is safe to abort  a  <b>wimexport</b>  command  partway
       through.   However,  after  doing  this,  it  is recommended to run <b>wimoptimize</b> on the destination WIM to
       remove any data that was appended to the physical WIM file but not yet incorporated into the structure of
       the WIM, unless the WIM was being rebuilt (e.g. with <b>--rebuild</b>), in which  case  you  should  delete  the
       temporary file left over.

       <u>Data</u>  <u>deduplication</u>:  The WIM format has built-in deduplication (also called "single instancing") of file
       contents.  Therefore, when an image is exported, only the  file  contents  not  already  present  in  the
       destination  WIM  will be physically copied.  However, a new copy of the image's metadata resource, which
       describes the image's directory structure, will always be created.

       <u>ESD</u> <u>files</u>: <b>wimexport</b> supports solid-compressed WIMs, or "ESD" (.esd) files, except  for  encrypted  ESDs,
       which  must  be  decrypted  first.  The source and destination files of <b>wimexport</b> can be solid WIMs, non-
       solid WIMs, or a combination thereof.  If the destination file does not exist, then by default it will be
       created as solid if the source was solid, or as non-solid if the source was non-solid.  To override this,
       either specify <b>--solid</b> to create a solid WIM (.esd file), or specify <b>--compress</b>=<u>LZX</u> to create a  standard
       non-solid WIM (.wim file).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Export the second image of 'boot.wim' to the new WIM file 'new.wim':

              wimexport boot.wim 2 new.wim

       The  above example creates "new.wim" with the same compression type as "boot.wim".  If you wish to change
       the compression type, specify <b>--compress</b>=<u>TYPE</u>; for example:

              wimexport boot.wim 2 new.wim --compress=LZX

       Export "ESD to WIM" --- that is, solid WIM to non-solid WIM:

              wimexport install.esd all install.wim --compress=LZX

       Export "WIM to ESD" --- that is, non-solid WIM to solid WIM:

              wimexport install.wim all install.esd --solid
