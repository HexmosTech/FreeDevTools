</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pamtofits - convert a Netpbm image into FITS format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pamtofits</b> [<b>-max</b> <u>f</u>] [<b>-min</b> <u>f</u>] [<u>pamfile</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pamtofits</b> reads a PNM or PAM image as input and produces a FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) file as
       output.   The  resolution  of  the output file is either 8 bits/pixel, or 16 bits/pixel, depending on the
       value of maxval in the input file.  If the input file is a PBM or PGM image, the output file consists  of
       a  single plane image (NAXIS = 2). If instead the input file is a PPM image, the output file will consist
       of a three-plane image (NAXIS = 3, NAXIS3 = 3).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably  <b>-quiet</b>,  see   Common
       Options ), <b>pamtofits</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       <b>-min</b>  and  <b>-max</b> tell <b>pamtofits</b> what "physical values" zero and maxval sample values, respectively, in the
       input image represent.  Physical values are a FITS concept.  <b>pamtofits</b> sets up the <b>BSCALE</b> and <b>BZERO</b>  FITS
       header cards to indicate this information.

       The default for <b>-min</b> is 0 and for <b>-max</b> is the maxval, which means if you don't specify these options, the
       FITS physical values are in fact the original Netpbm sample values.

       <b>pamtofits</b>  always sets up the FITS header <b>DATAMIN</b> and <b>DATAMAX</b> cards to indicate that the highest physical
       value in the image is the one corresponding to the Netpbm maxval and the lowest is that corresponding  to
       Netpbm  zero.   This  isn't really how those cards are supposed to be used, since the input image doesn't
       necessarily contain the full possible range of sample values.  It is a conservative approximation.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Pixel</b> <b>Order</b>
       The FITS specification does not specify which data in the file corresponds to which pixel  in  the  image
       (i.e. which bytes are the top left pixel, etc.).  Netpbm uses the common sense, most popular arrangement:
       row  major,  top to bottom, left to right.  That means in a 10 wide by 20 high image, the first 10 pixels
       in the file are the top row and the last 10 are the bottom row.  Within each row, the first pixel is  the
       leftmost one and the last pixel is the rightmost one.

       <b>Netpbm</b>  has  always done that, since it first understood the FITS format in 1989, so it is something of a
       de facto standard.  Nobody reported trouble with that until 2008.

       However, at least some versions of ImageMagick and Gimp (as seen in 2008) use bottom to top order, so  if
       you  use  on of these to display a FITS image generated by <b>pamtofits</b>, it will appear upside down.  To fix
       that, use <b>pamflip</b> <b>-topbottom</b> on the image before feeding it to <b>pamtofits</b>.

       Since 2008, people have noted that NASA distributes FITS files with bottom to top order.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pamtofits</b> was originally <b>pnmtofits</b> and did not handle PAM input.  It was extended and renamed  in  Netpbm
       10.30 (October 2005).

       <b>pnmtofits</b> was itself an extension of <b>pgmtofits</b>, which was added to Pbmplus in 1989.
