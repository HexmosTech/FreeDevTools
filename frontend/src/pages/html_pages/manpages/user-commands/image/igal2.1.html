       igal2 - online Image GALlery generator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>igal2</b> <u>[-option1</u> <u>-option2</u> <u>...]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>igal2</b>  is  a quick and easy program for placing your images online with just one command-line invocation.
       It generates a pretty good-looking set of W3-compliant static HTML slides even with its default settings.
       To try it out just run <b>igal2</b> in a directory with <u>jpg</u>, <u>gif</u> or <u>png</u> files and check  the  output  in  a  web
       browser.   You  can  adjust the appearance of the image gallery with the many options listed below or (if
       you know a bit of HTML) by modifying the <u>.indextemplate.html</u>,  <u>.slidetemplate.html</u>  and  <u>igal2.css</u>  files
       that  <b>igal2</b>  creates  in  your  image  directory.   <b>igal2</b> also checks for the existence of a <u>$HOME/.igal2</u>
       directory where users can store their own templates, overriding the site-wide <u>/usr/share/igal2</u>.

       <b>igal2</b> needs <b>Perl</b> to run and it also relies on a few other programs that come  standard  with  most  Linux
       distributions.   It  relies  on  the <b>ImageMagick</b> package first if available, otherwise it falls back onto
       <b>cjpeg</b>/<b>djpeg</b>/<b>pnmscale</b> for processing <u>jpg</u> files.   The  command  <b>convert</b>  of  the  <b>ImageMagick</b>  package  is
       required  to  process  <u>gif</u> and <u>png</u> files and the <b>identify</b> command enables <b>igal2</b> to include IMG HEIGHT and
       WIDTH tags in the HTML it generates.  If you would like to show the EXIF headers of  the  images  (option
       -e) Image::ExifTools is needed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>     Write  image  dimensions and sizes under each thumbnail on the index page.  This only works if the
              ImageMagick command <b>identify</b> is present.

       <b>--ad</b>   Like <b>-a</b> but write only the image dimensions.

       <b>--as</b>   Like <b>-a</b> but write only the image sizes.

       <b>--bigy</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Like <b>-y</b> but operates on the image slides, not the thumbnails.  Scales image slides to some  medium
              height  (e.g.   <u>400</u>),  adjusting their width accordingly.  Useful if your digital camera spits out
              large images, like 1600x1200.  The originals aren't affected, but scaled copies of your images are
              stored with the <u>.slide</u> prefix and thumbnails link to these copies.  Clicking on the scaled  copies
              in  the  HTML  slides  lets  users  see  the  full  unscaled  images.  You must use <b>-f</b> between two
              consecutive runs when you've changed the value of <b>--bigy</b>.

       <b>-c</b>     First generate and then publish image slide captions. The first invocation of <b>igal2</b> <b>-c</b> generates a
              <u>.captions</u> file that you may edit.  The format of this file is very simple.  You should  only  have
              to  enter your captions after the <u>----</u> separator.  You may rearrange the image order at this point
              and also leave out some pictures by simply placing a pound (<u>#</u>) sign  at  the  beginning  of  their
              respective  lines.   A  second  invocation of <b>igal2</b> <b>-c</b> will read your <u>.captions</u> file, include your
              captions in the slides and rearrange them if necessary.

       <b>-C</b>     Like <u>-c</u> but preserve file names as captions when generating the <u>.captions</u> file (strips  file  name
              suffix).

       <b>--con</b> <u>options</u>
              Command  line  options  to  pass  on  to  <b>convert</b> or <b>cjpeg</b> internally (see their man pages).  This
              affects all thumbnails and, if <b>--bigy</b> is given, the medium-size  slides  too.   You  can  set  the
              <u>-quality</u>  or  go  crazy  with  <u>-negate</u>,  <u>-noise</u>,  etc.   (the  last  two only work with <b>convert</b> if
              <b>ImageMagick</b> is installed.

       <b>-d</b> <u>&lt;dir&gt;</u>
              Operate on image files in directory <u>&lt;dir&gt;</u>, which is also where the HTML and thumbnail  files  will
              be generated.  The default is the current directory.

       <b>-e</b>     Extract  all  EXIF  tags  from the images and display them on the image slides.  This option needs
              Image::ExifTool to be installed.

       <b>-f</b>     Force  thumbnail  regeneration.   Also  forces  medium-slide  regeneration  if  <b>--bigy</b>  is  given.
              Otherwise  <b>igal2</b>  will  not  regenerate these files if they already exist, and you may end up with
              stale copies.  Definitely use <b>-f</b> between two runs where you've changed  the  value  of  <b>--bigy</b>  or
              <b>--con</b>.

       <b>-h</b>     Display brief help, same as <b>--help</b>.

       <b>--help</b> Display brief help, same as <b>-h</b>.

       <b>-i</b> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
              Name  of  the  main  thumbnail  index  file.  The default is <u>index.html</u>, as desirable for most web
              servers.

       <b>-k</b>     Use the image captions for the HTML slide titles.  The default behavior is to use the image names.

       <b>-m</b> <u>&lt;watermarkfile&gt;</u>
              Add a watermark to each file. The  parameter  specified  is  another  image  file  which  will  be
              overlayed  in  the  top  left  of  the  image with some transparency applied. This option requires
              ImageMagick. The original images will be left in place with a '.unmarked' extension. You may  wish
              to delete those afterwards. If this option is specified on two consecutive runs, igal2 will detect
              the  .unmarked  versions  and  not  run it through the watermarking process again. Transparent GIF
              files work well for this option.

       <b>-n</b>     Use the image file names for the HTML slide files.  Otherwise the default behavior  is  to  simply
              name your slides <u>1.html</u>, <u>2.html</u>, and so on.

       <b>-o</b> <u>&lt;URL&gt;</u>
              Use  this  option  if  you  are  hosting the index files in a different location (e.g. a different
              server) from the back end images/slides. This option adds the specified prefix into  the  URLs  of
              the  slides.  If  you  use  this option, remember that until you move the files into the resulting
              location, the gallery won't work properly.

       <b>-p</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> The cellpadding value of the thumbnail index tables.  The default is 3.

       <b>-r</b>     Omit the film reel effect altogether.   For  a  simpler  look  you  can  also  set  the  thumbnail
              background  to be the same as the main index page background with the tile background-color option
              in the <u>igal2.css</u> file.

       <b>-s</b>     For the simplest setup, omit all HTML slides.  Clicking the thumbnails on the main page will  just
              take users to the plain image files.

       <b>-t</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> Height  (in  pixels)  of the tiled image used to simulate the top and bottom "film reel" effect on
              the thumbnail index page.  This is 21 for the default <u>.tile.png</u> image used, but you should set  it
              otherwise if you replace that file with your own design.

       <b>-u</b>     Write  image  captions  under each thumbnail on the index page.  If you have a <u>.captions</u> file (see
              options -c or -C) then the captions are read from there, else the file names  are  used  (but  the
              file extension is stripped).

       <b>--pagination</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Maximum  number  of  images  on  one page.  If the given number of images is reached a new page is
              started. Pagination number n should be a multiple of parameter -w (default 5).  Default 0 -  means
              no pagination at all.

       <b>-w</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> Set the thumbnail rows to be <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> images wide in the main index file.  Default is 5.

       <b>-x</b>     Omit the image count from the captions.

       <b>-y</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> Scale all thumbnails to the same height of <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> pixels.  The default is 75 pixels.

       <b>--xy</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Scale  thumbnails  to  <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> pixels along their longest dimension.  This value is passed to <b>pnmscale</b>
              and only works properly for <u>jpg</u> images.

       <b>--www</b>  Make all <b>igal2</b> files world-readable.

       <b>--dest</b> <u>&lt;dir&gt;</u>
              Per default igal2 places all  igal2  helper  files  (thumbnails,  slidefiles,  CSS,  etc)  in  the
              directory  where  the  image  files  reside.   With  this  option  these  files can be placed in a
              subdirectory of the image directory.

       <b>--AddSubdir</b>
              If igal2 finds subdirectories below your image directory it will add links to this directories  in
              the index.html file. This is useful if you've a tree of image directories.

               Example:
               !
               + Vacation_Vienna (Image Directory)
                 !
                 + .igal2-stuff (igal2 helper files)
                 + Videos
                 + Documents_of_interest

               igal2 -d Vacation_Vienna --dest .igal2-stuff --AddSubdir

              will  put  all helper files in .igal2-stuff, and generate links to the subdirectories "Videos" and
              "Documents_of_interest" in the index.html file.

              Note: igal2 will not work recursively, it just adds HREF links to the found directories.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/usr/share/igal2/indextemplate2.html</u>
              The default index template file.
       <u>/usr/share/igal2/slidetemplate2.html</u>
              The default file used to generate slides.
       <u>/usr/share/igal2/igal2/igal2.css</u>
              The default style sheet template.
       <u>/usr/share/igal2/igal2/tile.png</u>
              The tiled image used for the "film reel" effect.
       <u>/usr/share/igal2/directoryline2.html</u>
              The default file used to generate directory links in index.html. If  this  file  is  changed,  the
              index.html has to be regenerated by running igal2 again.
       All  five  files are copied to your image directory as dotfiles the first time you run <b>igal2</b>.  Modify the
       local copies (but keep their names) if you need to further alter the appearance of your slide show  (also
       see <b>-t</b>).  <b>igal2</b> also checks for the existence of a <u>$HOME/.igal2</u> directory where users can store their own
       templates, overriding the site-wide <u>/usr/share/igal2/igal2</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Run  <b>igal2</b>  in  a  directory  with  <u>jpg</u>  or  <u>gif</u>  images to see what it does.  Then play with the options
       described above and use <b>-h</b> if you need a quick listing.   Also  see  <u><a href="http://igal.trexler.at/">http://igal.trexler.at/</a></u>  for  online
       examples.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  always some.  If you find any let me know.  I don't have much time to keep tweaking <b>igal2</b> but
       if any major bugs pop up I probably ought to fix them.
