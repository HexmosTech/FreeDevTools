</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cvc4, pcvc4 - an automated theorem prover

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cvc4</b> <b>[</b> <u>options</u> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <u>file</u> <b>]</b>

       <b>pcvc4</b> <b>[</b> <u>options</u> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <u>file</u> <b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cvc4</b>  is  an  automated  theorem  prover  for first-order formulas with respect to background theories of
       interest.  <b>pcvc4</b> is CVC4's "portfolio" variant, which is capable of running multiple  CVC4  instances  in
       parallel, configured differently.

       With  <u>file</u>  , commands are read from <u>file</u> and executed.  CVC4 supports the SMT-LIB (versions 1.2 and 2.0)
       input format, as well as its own native “presentation language” (see <b><a href="../man5/cvc4.5.html">cvc4</a></b>(5) ), which is similar in  many
       respects to CVC3's presentation language, but not identical.

       If  <u>file</u> is unspecified, standard input is read (and the <b>CVC4</b> presentation language is assumed).  If <u>file</u>
       is unspecified and <b>CVC4</b> is connected to a terminal, interactive mode is assumed.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Each option marked with [*] has a --no-OPTIONNAME variant, which reverses the sense of the option.

       Each option marked with [*] has a --no-OPTIONNAME variant, which reverses the sense of the option.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>CVC4</b> reports all syntactic and semantic errors on standard error.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>CVC4</b> effort is the culmination of fifteen years  of  theorem  proving  research,  starting  with  the
       <u>Stanford</u> <u>Validity</u> <u>Checker</u> <u>(SVC)</u> in 1996.

       SVC's  successor,  the <u>Cooperating</u> <u>Validity</u> <u>Checker</u> <u>(CVC),</u> had a more optimized internal design, produced
       proofs, used the <u>Chaff</u> SAT solver, and featured a number of usability enhancements.  Its name comes  from
       the  cooperative  nature  of  decision procedures in Nelson-Oppen theory combination, which share amongst
       each other equalities between shared terms.

       CVC Lite, first made available in 2003, was a rewrite of CVC that attempted to  make  CVC  more  flexible
       (hence  the “lite”) while extending the feature set: CVCLite supported quantifiers where its predecessors
       did not.  CVC3 was a major overhaul  of  portions  of  CVC  Lite:  it  added  better  decision  procedure
       implementations, added support for using MiniSat in the core, and had generally better performance.

       CVC4  is  the  new  version,  the  fifth generation of this validity checker line that is now celebrating
       fifteen years of heritage.  It represents a complete re-evaluation of the core architecture  to  be  both
       performant  and  to  serve  as  a  cutting-edge research vehicle for the next several years.  Rather than
       taking CVC3 and redesigning problem parts, we've taken a  clean-room  approach,  starting  from  scratch.
       Before using any designs from CVC3, we have thoroughly scrutinized, vetted, and updated them.  Many parts
       of CVC4 bear only a superficial resemblance, if any, to their correspondent in CVC3.

       However,  CVC4  is  fundamentally  similar  to  CVC3 and many other modern SMT solvers: it is a DPLL( <u>T</u> )
       solver, with  a  SAT  solver  at  its  core  and  a  delegation  path  to  different  decision  procedure
       implementations, each in charge of solving formulas in some background theory.

       The  re-evaluation and ground-up rewrite was necessitated, we felt, by the performance characteristics of
       CVC3.  CVC3 has many useful features, but some core aspects of the design led to high memory use, and the
       use of heavyweight computation (where more nimble engineering approaches could suffice) makes CVC3 a much
       slower prover than other tools.  As these designs are central to CVC3, a new version was preferable to  a
       selective re-engineering, which would have ballooned in short order.
