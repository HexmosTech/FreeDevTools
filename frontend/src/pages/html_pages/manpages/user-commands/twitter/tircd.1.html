</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tircd  - An ircd proxy to the twitter API

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       tircd presents twitter as an irc channel.  You can connect to tircd with any irc client, and twitter as
       if you were on irc

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       tircd requires a recent version of perl, and the following modules:

       POE

       POE::Filter::IRCD

       Net::Twitter::Lite::WithAPIv1_1

       JSON::Any

       Time::Local

       File::Glob

       IO::File

       LWP::UserAgent

       Storable

       URI

       List::Util

       HTML::Entities

       Digest::SHA1

       If you're using a redhat or debian based system, attempt to use the distrobutions CPAN module packages,
       in yum or apt.

       To install all modules via CPAN:

       <b>cpan</b> <b>-i</b> <b>POE</b> <b>POE::Filter::IRCD</b> <b>Net::Twitter::Lite</b> <b>JSON::Any</b> <b>Time::Local</b> <b>File::Glob</b> <b>IO::File</b> <b>LWP::UserAgent</b>
       <b>Storable</b> <b>URI</b> <b>List::Util</b> <b>HTML::Entities</b> <b>Digest::SHA1</b>

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Running tircd
           <b>./tircd.pl</b> <b>[/path/to/tircd.cfg]</b>

           When started, tircd will look for a configuration file in the following places:

           <u>tircd.cfg</u> (in the current directory)

           <u><a href="file:~/.tircd">~/.tircd</a></u>

           <u>/etc/tircd.cfg</u>

           You  can  specify  an alternate path to the configuration file on the commandline if you want to keep
           the configuration in another  location.   There  is  an  example  config  provided  as  part  of  the
           distribution.  The  easiest  way to get started is to just rename that file from <u>tircd.cfg.example</u> to
           <u>tircd.cfg</u>

   <b>Connecting</b>
       By default, tircd listens on localhost port 6667.

       The first time you connect with a new twitter account you must specify a <b>tircd</b> password  for  that  nick.
       This  password does not have to (and should not) be the same as your twitter password. This password will
       protect your tircd account from unauthorized usage.

       <b>The</b> <b>above</b> <b>password</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>your</b> <b>tircd</b> <b>account,</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b>  <b>to</b>  <b>your</b>  <b>twitter</b>  <b>account.</b>  <b>The</b>
       <b>tircd</b> <b>nick</b> <b>password</b> <b>will</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>logged</b> <b>into</b> <b>Twitter</b>

       With  many  irc  clients  you  can do this by issuing the command /SERVER localhost 6667 &lt;<b>tircd</b> password&gt;
       &lt;<b>twitter</b> username&gt;. Check your client's documentation for the appropirate syntax.

       Tircd will make an OAuth challenege to Twitter, and Twitter will return a link to a page  where  you  can
       authorize the connection. This link will appear in your IRC connection status window.

       Make  sure you are either logged into twitter as the account you plan to use, or not logged in. Click the
       authorize link and log-in, then click "Allow". Twitter will then  present  you  with  a  PIN  number.  <b>To</b>
       <b>complete</b>  <b>your</b>  <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> <b>tircd</b>, type: <b>/stats</b> <b>pin</b> <b>&lt;PIN</b> <b>NUMBER</b>&gt;. On some clients you may have to type:
       <b>/quote</b> <b>stats</b> <b>pin</b> <b>&lt;PIN</b> <b>NUMBER</b>&gt;.

       If the PIN is accepted by Twitter, the connection will be established.  You  may  now  join  #twitter  to
       begin. If the PIN is not accepted, another authorization link will be generated.

       Account password protection
           If  your  tircd  installation  is  running in a shared environment (either listening on the localhost
           address on a shared computer, or listening on a public IP) you might want to  password  protect  your
           account,  or  anyone  can  access  your  twitter  account knowing the server address and your twitter
           username.  <b>Your</b> <b>tircd-password</b> <b>do</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>(and</b> <b>should</b>  <b>not</b>  <b>be!)</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>same</b>  <b>as</b>  <b>your</b>  <b>twitter</b>
           <b>password.</b>

           Tircd supports password protection in the following way.

           •   The  first  time you connect to tircd with a new Username, no password checking is done.  You are
               presented with the OAuth URL, and need to log in to twitter on the web,  and  enter  the  PIN  as
               described above.

           •   When  the  PIN  is  accepted,  IF  your  client  connected  with a password set, this password is
               encrypted (hashed) and saved along with your twitter access-tokens.

           •   Next time you  connect,  tircd  will  first  check  to  see  if  a  password  is  saved  in  your
               <u>Username.config</u>, and comapre it with the one your client sends.

           •   If  they  match,  your  connecton  is allowed, and tircd continue to verify the OAuth tokens with
               twitter.

           •   If they don't match, the client is disconnected with an error message.

           •   If you want to change your password, or did not set one on your first connection, you can  do  so
               after you have connected to tircd with a simple "/STATS password &lt;password&gt;"

           •   Be  aware that if you do this, you will also have to make sure your client uses the same password
               next time you connect to tircd.

           •   If you want to remove the password, simply issue a "/STATS password" without any password set.

           There is currently no way of regaining access to your account if you forget it.  To reset your  tircd
           password,  you  will have to remove your Username.config and authorize with twitter using OAuth and a
           PIN again.

   <b>After</b> <b>connecting</b>
       Once connected "/JOIN #twitter" to get started.  The channel #twitter is  where  you  will  perform  most
       opertions

       Updating your status
           To  update your status on twitter, simply send a message starting with "!t " to the #twitter channel.
           The server will keep your most recent update in the topic at all times.

           If you want to have all message you send to #twitter posted as tweets, you can set the config  option
           "auto_post"  to  1.  Either  in  tircd.conf  or  via  the  /stats command. Messages beginning with an
           exclamation point ("!") will still be processed as commands, not tweeted.

       Getting your friend's status
           When users you follow update their status, it will be sent to the channel as  a  message  from  them.
           Each  status  will  be  preceded  by a 3 letter identifier such as [a7f]. This identifier is used for
           retweeting and replying to tweets.

           @replies are also sent to the channel as messages.

       Retweeting a status
           To retweet a status, use the offerbot command !retweet followed by the 3 letter tweet identifier.

           <b>!retweet</b> <b>a7f</b>

       Replying to a status
           To reply to a status update, use the offerbot  command  !retweet  followed  by  the  3  letter  tweet
           identifier.

           <b>!reply</b> <b>6eb</b> <b>@tircdbot</b> <b>not</b> <b>today!</b>

       Favoriting a tweet
           To favorite a tweet use the offerbot command !favorite followed by the 3 letter tweet identifier.

           <b>!favorite</b> <b>a44</b>

       Listing the users you follow
           Each  user  you  follow  will be in the #twitter channel.  If you follow a new user outside of tircd,
           that user will join the channel the first time they update their status.  People who follow you  back
           are given voice (+v) to indicate that fact.

       Direct Messages
           Direct messages to you will show up as a private message from the user.

           To send a direct message, simply send a private message to the user you want to dm.

       Getting additional information on users
           You  can  /WHO or /WHOIS a user to view their Location / Bio / Website. Their last status update (and
           time sent) will also be returned.

           Issuing a /WHOIS on your own user name will also provide the number of API calls that have been  used
           in the last hour.

       Following new users
           To  begin  following  a new user, simply /INVITE them to #twitter.  The user will join the channel if
           the request to follow was successful.  If you attempt to invite a user who  protects  their  updates,
           you  will receive a notice that you have requested to follow them.  The user will join the channel if
           they accept your request and update their status.

           <b>!invite</b> is the analogous offerbot command.

       Unfollowing / removing users
           To stop following a user, /KICK them from #twitter.

           <b>!kick</b> is the analogous offerbot command.

       Blocking users
           To block a user /BAN them.  There is currently no way to get a list of users you've currently blocked
           via the API, so listing the bans in #twitter will only return users you've  blocked  in  the  current
           session.

       Unblocking users
           To unblock a user /UNBAN them.

       Multiple Channels / Groups
           If  you  want  to  create  a channel with just a subset of the people you follow, you can "/JOIN &lt;any
           channel&gt;" and then /INVITE them to the channel.  tircd will send a user's updates to #twitter and any
           other channels you have invited a user to.

       Search
           If you want to have updated search results for  a  specific  term  delivered,  you  can  "/JOIN  &lt;any
           channel&gt;"  then  set  the /topic for the channel to your search query.  Results that match that query
           will be sent to that channel. The /TOPIC can be almost anything supported by the twitter search  (see
           &lt;<a href="http://support.twitter.com/articles/71577-how-to-use-advanced-twitter-search">http://support.twitter.com/articles/71577-how-to-use-advanced-twitter-search</a>&gt;  for exmaples).  Using
           the 'near' option is not currently supported.

       User config
           Certain options are changeable at runtime and set per user. To  see  a  list  of  options  and  their
           current values simply send an "/STATS m" command to the server.

           These  options  are  saved  in  a  file with the name <u>Username.config</u> (where Username is your twitter
           username) located in a directory set in the global config file (default: <u>/tmp/tricd</u>)

       Offerbot commands
           Tircd supports offerbot style control. All functions available through the offerbot are available  as
           they're  metaphorically  appropriate  IRC  functions.  Therefore,  retweeting, replying to a specific
           tweet, and saving the user configuration are <b>only</b> available through the offerbot.

           <b>![update|up|refresh]</b> - Updates the #twitter stream immediately.

           <b>![tweet|t]</b> <b>&lt;text</b> <b>of</b> <b>tweet</b>&gt; - Posts the given text as an update to your feed.

           <b>![retweet|rt]</b> <b>&lt;tweed-id</b>&gt; - Posts a retweet. tweet-id is the 3 digit code preceding the tweet.

           <b>![reply|re]</b> <b>&lt;tweet-id</b> &lt;message text&gt;&gt; - Replies to a tweet. tweet-id is a the 3 digit code  preceding
           the tweet.

           <b>![conversation|conv]</b>  <b>&lt;tweet-id</b>&gt;  -  Replay  a  conversation from beginning. If tweet is not a reply,
           shows related tweets.

           <b>![add|invite|follow]</b> <b>&lt;username</b>&gt; - Begin following the specified twitter username.

           <b>![remove|kick|unfollow]</b> <b>&lt;username</b>&gt; - Remove the  username  from  the  list  of  people  your  account
           follows.

           <b>!save</b> - Saves twitter-username specific configuration immediately.

           <b>!help</b> - Shows this help message.
