       <b>--long-help</b>, <b>--help-long</b>
              Gives a detailed list of command line options.

       <b>--wiki-help</b>, <b>--help-wiki</b>, <b>--mediawiki-help</b>, <b>--help-mediawiki</b>
              Gives a detailed list of command line options in Mediawiki format.

       <b>--version</b>, <b>--version-short</b>, <b>--short-version</b>
              Gives some version information about the program.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--input</b> &lt;image file&gt;
              Name of the input FITS image file.

   <b>Simple</b> <b>aperture</b> <b>photometry:</b>
       <b>-L</b>, <b>--input-list</b> &lt;input coordinate list file&gt;
              Name of the input coordinate list file.

       <b>--col-xy</b> &lt;colx&gt;,&lt;coly&gt;
              Column  indices  for  centroid coordinates. The coordinates read from this file follows the native
              coordinating scheme (which is not the same as e.g. in IRAF), namely the lower-left corner  of  the
              lower-left  pixel  has  the  coordinate  of (0,0) while the center of the lower-left pixel has the
              coordinate of (0.5,0.5). Programs like IRAF use  the  coordinate  (1,1)  for  the  center  of  the
              lower-left pixel.

       <b>--col-ap</b> &lt;A1&gt;,&lt;A2&gt;,...
              Column  indices  for  various  apertures. In each such column, there must be three colon-separated
              number, for the radius of the aperture, inner radius for the background annulus and the  thickness
              of  the  annulus,  respectively.  This option is not mandatory, all of the objects can be measured
              with the same set of apertures, see also <b>-a</b>|--apertures for more details.

       <b>--col-id</b> &lt;identifier column&gt;
              Column index for object identifier.

       <b>--col-mag</b>, <b>--col-magnitude</b> &lt;magnitude column&gt;
              Column index for reference magnitude.

       <b>--col-col</b>, <b>--col-color</b> &lt;color column&gt;
              Column index for photometric color.

       <b>--col-err</b>, <b>--col-error</b> &lt;magnitude error column&gt;
              Column index for magnitude uncertainty.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--zoom</b> &lt;zoom level&gt;
              Mutiply both the input centroid coordinates and aperture/annulusradii by the given integer factor.

       <b>--serial</b> &lt;serial&gt;
              Serial identifier for the whole photometry procedure. Can be any arbitrary string and used only in
              the formatted output (see <b>-F</b>|--format for more details).

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--format</b>, <b>--format-output</b> &lt;objecttags&gt;,&lt;photometrytags&gt;
              List of output format tags. The formatted (user-friendly) output photometry contains a few columns
              containing the data related to the  object,  which  followed  by  a  the  per-aperture  photometry
              results. See "Format tags" for the list of format tags used here.

       <b>--nan</b> &lt;nan-string&gt;
              String  which  is used to denote bad photometry. By default, objects on which photometry cannot be
              performed (due to various reasons, e.g. the object is off from the  image,  the  background  level
              cannot  be determined or there are bad pixels in the aperture itself), are marked by a simple dash
              ('-') in the output file.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--input-mask</b> &lt;image file&gt;
              Input mask file to co-add to the mask of the input image. Useful for marking pixels to be  ignored
              from the photometry process beyond the ones which are previously marked in the input image.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--aperture</b>, <b>--apertures</b> &lt;list of circular apertures&gt;
              List  of circular apertures to be involved in the photometry. Each circular aperture is defined by
              three numbers: the radius of the aperture, and the inner radius and  "thickness"  of  the  annulus
              used  for sky background estimation. The aperture specifications must be spearated by commas while
              these three numbers must be separated by colons. E.g. to perform aperture photometry on  a  series
              of  apertures  with a radius of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 pixels, where all of the annuli have an inner and
              outer radius of 6.5  and  12  pixels  (i.e.  the  thickness  is  5.5  pixels),  one  should  write
              1.5:6.5:5.5,2.0:6.5:5.5,2.5:6.5:5.5 as an argument for this option.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--aperture</b>, <b>--apertures</b> &lt;list of simple polygon apertures&gt;
              List  of  polygon  shaped apertures. Polygons can only be simple (i.e. non-intersection) or weakly
              simple   polygons   which   are   defined   throughout   the   form   of   P[x1,y1,...,xn,yn]   or
              polygon[x1,y1,...,xn,yn]. The (x,y)=(0,0) point always refer to the aperture centroid as read from
              the  input list (see <b>--input-list</b> above). There are two types of pre-defined simple polygons which
              is  useful  in  astronomical  image  processing.  The  first   definition   is   Q[R,n,alpha]   or
              regular[R,n,alpha]  which  implies  a  regular  polygon having n sides and an area equivalent to a
              circle with a radius of R and the polygon is rotated w.r.t the xy-plane by "alpha" degrees. In the
              asymptotic limit of n -&gt; infinity, this aperture is equivalent to a circular aperture. The  second
              type   is   T[R,n,dx,dy]   or  trail[R,n,dx,dy]  where  this  definition  implies  a  nearly  oval
              racetrack-shaped aperture with a curvature radius of R, a net  length  of  L=sqrt(dx^2+dy^2),  the
              round  part is approximated by a regular n-gon and the whole shape is rotated w.r.t the x+ axis as
              defined by the (dx,dy) vector. In the limit of L -&gt; 0, this shape is equivalent  to  the  aperture
              definition  of  regular[R,n,alpha].  The  trail[....]  shape  is  useful  to perform photometry on
              asteroid or meteoroid trails. One should note  that  circular  and  polygon  aperture  definitions
              cannot  be  mixed.  In  addition, it should be noted that in case of polygon-shaped apertures, the
              second definition implies the inner edge of the background area and the third  definition  implies
              the  outer  edge  of  the background area. For instance, the aperture 3:5:5 can be ideal for point
              sources, the aperture trail[3,16,3.0,4.0]:trail[5,16,3.0,4.0]:trail[10,16,3.0,4.0] can be  optimal
              for  a  asteroid trail on the same image that has a net length of 5.0 pixels and parallel with the
              vector (3.0,4.0). In this case, the equivalent radius of the third part is  set  to  10  which  is
              equivalent to the 5+5=10 pixels of the radius of the outer annulus in the definition of 3:5:5.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--gain</b>, <b>--gain-poly</b> &lt;gain polynomial&gt;
              The  polynomial  describing  the gain level throughout the image. Altough during the image readout
              process, the electron &lt;-&gt; ADU conversion ratio has a fixed value, during the  calibration  process
              when  the  vignetting  is  strong,  the  ADU  levels may substantially change. The comma-separated
              numbers in the gain polynomial should denote the coefficients for the monomials 1, x,  y,  1/2x^2,
              xy,  ...  (the  standard  order  for 2 dimensional polynomial coefficients), where x and y are the
              normalized coordinates (i.e. zero at the center of the image, x = +/- 1 at the right/left edge  of
              the  image  and  y  is  scaled  appropriately  keeping  the aspect ratio). Note that the number of
              coefficients should be 1, 3, 6, 10, ... and so on,  for  zeroth,  first,  second,  third...  order
              variations,  respectively.Specifying  zero or negative gain will imply an "infinitely large" gain,
              thus data are treated as being affected only by  instrumental  noise  and  lack  intrinsic  photon
              noise.

       <b>--gain-vmin</b> &lt;minimal gain&gt;
              The  minimal value for the gain level. If the polynomial describing the spatial gain variations is
              evaluated on the regular image domain and yielded a smaller value than  this  given  number,  this
              will  be  used  as gain level. In certain optical systems, the vignetting can be well described by
              second-order polynomial coefficients except at the very corners of the image. In such a  situation
              this minimal gain is quite useful.

       <b>--correlation-length</b> &lt;background correlation length&gt;
              Correlation  length  of the image. This number is used as an estimator for background noise in the
              case of images where the background shows correlation. By default, this parameter is unity  (1.0).
              If  the  image  is  magnified  during processing, then one should specify this magnification ratio
              here. For instance, if an  image  is  created  with  `fitrans  <b>--zoom</b>  4`,  then  specify  `fiphot
              <b>--correlation-length</b> 4 ...` as well.

       <b>--mag-flux</b> &lt;mag&gt;,&lt;flux&gt;
              Magnitude  -  flux  conversion  level. The specified magnitude will be equivalent to the specified
              flux level.

       <b>--sky-fit</b> &lt;sky fitting parameters&gt;
              This argument is followed by a set of parameters for  the  sky  (i.e.  background  level)  fitting
              algorithm. See "Sky fitting parameters" below for more details.

       <b>--aperture-mask-ignore</b> &lt;list of masks&gt;
              This  switch  is  followed  by a space separated list of standard masks which should be ignored if
              such a pixel is marked so in the aperutre. In practice,  it  might  be  useful  to  put  saturated
              objects into the set of "good" stars.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output</b> &lt;output photometry file&gt;
              Name  of the output file containing the results of the aperture photometry. The format and content
              of this file can be arbitrarily set, see <b>-F</b>|--format.

       <b>--output-raw-photometry</b> &lt;output raw photometry&gt;
              Name of the output file containing the all of the low-level photometric  information  in  a  fixed
              format.  From  this  file,  one can derive all of the quantities which are written to the "normal"
              output photometry file. The main purpose of this file is to be  an  input  for  image  subtraction
              based  photometry,  i.e.  the  photometric  information  for the reference image is supposed to be
              stored in this format and the successive calls of `fiphot` on the subtracted residual images  read
              this  information  in  order  to  derive  the  final  photometric  information. See the subsection
              "Photometry on subtracted/convolved images" about more details  on  the  image  subtraction  based
              photometry.

       Note that the literal "auto" argument can also be used after the <b>-g</b>|--gain switch. In this case, `fiphot`
       tries  to  figure  out the gain polynomial from the GAINPOLY and GAIN keywords (in this order) as well as
       the minimal value for the gain from the GAINVMIN keyword.

   <b>Fine</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> <b>aperture</b> <b>photometry:</b>
       <b>-j</b>, <b>--disjoint-annuli</b>, <b>--disjoint-rings</b>
              During the bacground determination on the aperture annuli, omit the pixels which  belongs  to  the
              annuli of other centriods. On very dense fields this might make the aperture photometry impossible
              since  for  some or many of the target centroids, the bacground level cannot be derived due to the
              lack of sufficient number of background pixels.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--disjoint-apertures</b>
              During the bacground determination on the aperture annuli, omit the pixels which  belongs  to  the
              apertures of other centriods.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--disjoint-radius</b> &lt;radius&gt;
              During the bacground determination on the aperture annuli, omit the pixels which are closer to the
              other centroids than the specified radius.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--spline</b>
              Use  a  flux-conserving  biquadratic  spline  interpolation  surface for photometry purposes. This
              surface yields some sort of weighting within each pixel  due  to  the  properties  of  the  spline
              interpolation.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--magfit</b> orders=&lt;c0&gt;[:&lt;c1&gt;[:&lt;c2&gt;[:&lt;c3&gt;]]],iterations=&lt;d&gt;,sigma=&lt;s&gt;
              Perform  a magnitude transformation after the photometry. Currently impleneted only in the case of
              image subtraction photometry and always use the reference photometry (see  <b>--input-raw-photometry</b>)
              as  a reference for magnitude transformation too. This command line option must be followed by the
              parameters of the magnitude fit, namely  the  list  the  of  spatial  polynomial  orders  for  the
              subsequent  color  orders  (colon-separated  list), and the number of (optional) outlier rejection
              iterations and its limit in standard deviation (sigma) units.

   <b>Photometry</b> <b>on</b> <b>subtracted/convolved</b> <b>images:</b>
       <b>-P</b>, <b>--input-raw-photometry</b> &lt;input reference raw photometry&gt;
              Name of the file containing the coordinate lists and  the  raw  photometric  information  for  the
              reference image.

       <b>-K</b>, <b>--input-kernel</b> &lt;input file with kernel solution&gt;
              The  kernel  solution which resulted during the creation of the convolved and/or subtracted image.
              This information is also required for the proper self-consistent aperture photometry on subtracted
              images. Omitting this file will result an assumption  for  identical  convolution  transformation,
              which only appropriate if the subtracted image is created by a literal arithmetic subtraction (and
              not convolution based subtraction).

       <b>--normalize-kernel</b>
              Normalize  kernel  solution  on  each  point to unity. Useful for space-borne photometry with high
              variations in the PSF shape in the cases where the kernel  solution  is  derived  empirically  and
              there are many variable sources in the field.

   <b>Optimal</b> <b>aperture</b> <b>determination:</b>
       <b>--output-list</b> &lt;output coordinate list file&gt;
              The  name  of  the  output centroid list file, in which the radius of the optimal aperture is also
              stored. The optimal aperture is  derived  from  the  object  flux  itself,  the  gain  level,  the
              background  noise  and  the  FWHM  of the objects. The background noise can be specified using the
              <b>-d</b>|--sky-noise argument (see there). The FWHM is given by the option <b>-f</b>|--fwhm.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--skynoise</b> &lt;noise&gt;
              Sky (bacground level) noise level in ADUs.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--fwhm</b> &lt;FWHM&gt;
              Full width at half magnitude (FWHM) for the stellar objects.

   <b>Sky</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>parameters:</b>
       mean   Use the mean value of the pixels in the annulus as a sky value.

       median Use the median value of the pixels in the annulus as a sky value.

       mode   Use the mode of the pixels in the annulus as a sky value.

       iterations=&lt;iterations&gt;
              Do the specified number of iterations in order to reject outlier pixels.

       lower, upper, sigma=&lt;sigma level&gt;
              Lower, upper and generic (symmetric) outlier level in the units of standard deviations.

       force=&lt;level&gt;
              Use the forced constant level for sky background, with zero nominal scatter.
