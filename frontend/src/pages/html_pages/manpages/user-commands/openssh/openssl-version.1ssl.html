</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       openssl-version - print OpenSSL version information

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>openssl</b> <b>version</b> [<b>-help</b>] [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-b</b>] [<b>-o</b>] [<b>-f</b>] [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-e</b>] [<b>-m</b>] [<b>-r</b>] [<b>-c</b>] [<b>-w</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command is used to print out version information about OpenSSL.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-help</b>
           Print out a usage message.

       <b>-a</b>  All information, this is the same as setting all the other flags.

       <b>-v</b>  The current OpenSSL version.

       <b>-b</b>  The date the current version of OpenSSL was built.

       <b>-o</b>  Option information: various options set when the library was built.

       <b>-f</b>  Compilation flags.

       <b>-p</b>  Platform setting.

       <b>-d</b>  OPENSSLDIR setting.

       <b>-e</b>  ENGINESDIR settings.

       <b>-m</b>  MODULESDIR settings.

       <b>-r</b>  The random number generator source settings.

       <b>-c</b>  The OpenSSL CPU settings info.

       <b>-w</b>  The  OpenSSL <b>OSSL_WINCTX</b> build time variable, if set.  Used for computing Windows registry key names.
           This option is unavailable on non-Windows platforms.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       In OpenSSL versions prior to 3.4, OpenSSL had a  limitation  regarding  the  <b>OPENSSLDIR</b>,  <b>MODULESDIR</b>  and
       <b>ENGINESDIR</b> build time macros.  These macros were defined at build time, and represented filesystem paths.
       This  is  common  practice  on unix like systems, as there was an expectation that a given build would be
       installed to a pre-determined location.  On Windows however, there is no such expectation,  as  libraries
       can  be  installed  to  arbitrary  locations.  <b>OSSL_WINCTX</b> was introduced as a new build time variable to
       define a set of registry keys identified by the name  openssl-&lt;version&gt;-&lt;ctx&gt;,  in  which  the  &lt;version&gt;
       value  is  derived from the version string in the openssl source, and the &lt;ctx&gt; extension is derived from
       the <b>OSSL_WINCTX</b> variable.  The values of <b>OPENSSLDIR</b>, <b>ENGINESDIR</b> and <b>MODULESDIR</b>  can  be  set  to  various
       paths underneath this key to break the requirement to predict the installation path at build time.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The output of "openssl version -a" would typically be used when sending in a bug report.
