</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command allows PKCS#12 files (sometimes referred to as PFX files) to be created and parsed. PKCS#12
       files are used by several programs including Netscape, MSIE and MS Outlook.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are a lot of options the meaning of some depends of whether a PKCS#12 file is being created or
       parsed. By default a PKCS#12 file is parsed.  A PKCS#12 file can be created by using the <b>-export</b> option
       (see below).  The PKCS#12 export encryption and MAC options such as <b>-certpbe</b> and <b>-iter</b> and many further
       options such as <b>-chain</b> are relevant only with <b>-export</b>.  Conversely, the options regarding encryption of
       private keys when outputting PKCS#12 input are relevant only when the <b>-export</b> option is not given.

       The default encryption algorithm is AES-256-CBC with PBKDF2 for key derivation.

       When encountering problems loading legacy PKCS#12 files that involve, for example, RC2-40-CBC, try using
       the <b>-legacy</b> option and, if needed, the <b>-provider-path</b> option.

       <b>-help</b>
           Print out a usage message.

       <b>-passin</b> <u>arg</u>
           The  password  source  for  the input, and for encrypting any private keys that are output.  For more
           information about the format of <b>arg</b> see <b><a href="../man1/openssl-passphrase-options.1.html">openssl-passphrase-options</a></b>(1).

       <b>-passout</b> <u>arg</u>
           The password source for output files.

       <b>-password</b> <u>arg</u>
           With <b>-export</b>, <b>-password</b> is equivalent to <b>-passout</b>, otherwise it is equivalent to <b>-passin</b>.

       <b>-twopass</b>
           Prompt for separate integrity and encryption passwords: most software always assumes  these  are  the
           same so this option will render such PKCS#12 files unreadable. Cannot be used in combination with the
           options <b>-password</b>, <b>-passin</b> if importing from PKCS#12, or <b>-passout</b> if exporting.

       <b>-nokeys</b>
           No private keys will be output.

       <b>-nocerts</b>
           No certificates will be output.

       <b>-noout</b>
           This option inhibits all credentials output, and so the input is just verified.

       <b>-legacy</b>
           Use legacy mode of operation and automatically load the legacy provider.  If OpenSSL is not installed
           system-wide,  it  is  necessary  to also use, for example, "-provider-path ./providers" or to set the
           environment variable <b>OPENSSL_MODULES</b> to point to the directory where the providers can be found.

           In the legacy mode, the default algorithm for certificate encryption is RC2_CBC or 3DES_CBC depending
           on whether the RC2 cipher is enabled in the build. The default algorithm for private  key  encryption
           is  3DES_CBC.   If the legacy option is not specified, then the legacy provider is not loaded and the
           default encryption algorithm for both certificates and private keys is AES_256_CBC  with  PBKDF2  for
           key derivation.

       <b>-engine</b> <u>id</u>
           See "Engine Options" in <b><a href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl</a></b>(1).  This option is deprecated.

       <b>-provider</b> <u>name</u>
       <b>-provider-path</b> <u>path</u>
       <b>-propquery</b> <u>propq</u>
           See "Provider Options" in <b><a href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man7/provider.7.html">provider</a></b>(7), and <b><a href="../man7/property.7.html">property</a></b>(7).

       <b>-rand</b> <u>files</u>, <b>-writerand</b> <u>file</u>
           See "Random State Options" in <b><a href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl</a></b>(1) for details.

   <b>PKCS#12</b> <b>input</b> <b>(parsing)</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-in</b> <u>filename</u>|<u>uri</u>
           This  specifies  the  input filename or URI.  Standard input is used by default.  Without the <b>-export</b>
           option this must be PKCS#12 file to be parsed.  For use with the  <b>-export</b>  option  see  the  "PKCS#12
           output (export) options" section.

       <b>-out</b> <u>filename</u>
           The  filename  to  write  certificates and private keys to, standard output by default.  They are all
           written in PEM format.

       <b>-info</b>
           Output additional information about the PKCS#12 file structure, algorithms used and iteration counts.

       <b>-nomacver</b>
           Don't attempt to verify the integrity MAC.

       <b>-clcerts</b>
           Only output client certificates (not CA certificates).

       <b>-cacerts</b>
           Only output CA certificates (not client certificates).

       <b>-aes128</b>, <b>-aes192</b>, <b>-aes256</b>
           Use AES to encrypt private keys before outputting.

       <b>-aria128</b>, <b>-aria192</b>, <b>-aria256</b>
           Use ARIA to encrypt private keys before outputting.

       <b>-camellia128</b>, <b>-camellia192</b>, <b>-camellia256</b>
           Use Camellia to encrypt private keys before outputting.

       <b>-des</b>
           Use DES to encrypt private keys before outputting.

       <b>-des3</b>
           Use triple DES to encrypt private keys before outputting.

       <b>-idea</b>
           Use IDEA to encrypt private keys before outputting.

       <b>-noenc</b>
           Don't encrypt private keys at all.

       <b>-nodes</b>
           This option is deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0; use <b>-noenc</b> instead.

   <b>PKCS#12</b> <b>output</b> <b>(export)</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-export</b>
           This option specifies that a PKCS#12 file will be created rather than parsed.

       <b>-out</b> <u>filename</u>
           This specifies filename to write the PKCS#12 file to. Standard output is used by default.

       <b>-in</b> <u>filename</u>|<u>uri</u>
           This specifies the input filename or URI.  Standard input is  used  by  default.   With  the  <b>-export</b>
           option  this  is  a  file  with certificates and a key, or a URI that refers to a key accessed via an
           engine.  The order of credentials in a file doesn't matter but one private key and its  corresponding
           certificate  should  be present. If additional certificates are present they will also be included in
           the PKCS#12 output file.

       <b>-inkey</b> <u>filename</u>|<u>uri</u>
           The private key input for PKCS12 output.  If this option is not specified then the  input  file  (<b>-in</b>
           argument) must contain a private key.  If no engine is used, the argument is taken as a file.  If the
           <b>-engine</b>  option is used or the URI has prefix "org.openssl.engine:" then the rest of the URI is taken
           as key identifier for the given engine.

       <b>-certfile</b> <u>filename</u>
           An input file with extra certificates to be added to the PKCS#12 output  if  the  <b>-export</b>  option  is
           given.

       <b>-passcerts</b> <u>arg</u>
           The  password  source  for  certificate input such as <b>-certfile</b> and <b>-untrusted</b>.  For more information
           about the format of <b>arg</b> see <b><a href="../man1/openssl-passphrase-options.1.html">openssl-passphrase-options</a></b>(1).

       <b>-chain</b>
           If this option is present then the certificate chain of the  end  entity  certificate  is  built  and
           included  in  the PKCS#12 output file.  The end entity certificate is the first one read from the <b>-in</b>
           file if no key is given, else the first certificate matching the given key.  The  standard  CA  trust
           store  is used for chain building, as well as any untrusted CA certificates given with the <b>-untrusted</b>
           option.

       <b>-untrusted</b> <u>filename</u>
           An input file of untrusted certificates that may be used for chain building, which is  relevant  only
           when  a  PKCS#12 file is created with the <b>-export</b> option and the <b>-chain</b> option is given as well.  Any
           certificates that are actually part of the chain are added to the output.

       <b>-CAfile</b> <u>file</u>, <b>-no-CAfile</b>, <b>-CApath</b> <u>dir</u>, <b>-no-CApath</b>, <b>-CAstore</b> <u>uri</u>, <b>-no-CAstore</b>
           See "Trusted Certificate Options" in <b><a href="../man1/openssl-verification-options.1.html">openssl-verification-options</a></b>(1) for details.

       <b>-name</b> <u>friendlyname</u>
           This specifies the "friendly name" for the certificates and  private  key.  This  name  is  typically
           displayed in list boxes by software importing the file.

       <b>-caname</b> <u>friendlyname</u>
           This  specifies the "friendly name" for other certificates. This option may be used multiple times to
           specify names for all certificates in the order they appear. Netscape ignores friendly names on other
           certificates whereas MSIE displays them.

       <b>-CSP</b> <u>name</u>
           Write <u>name</u> as a Microsoft CSP name.  The password source  for  the  input,  and  for  encrypting  any
           private   keys   that   are   output.    For   more   information   about   the  format  of  <b>arg</b>  see
           <b><a href="../man1/openssl-passphrase-options.1.html">openssl-passphrase-options</a></b>(1).

       <b>-LMK</b>
           Add the "Local Key Set" identifier to the attributes.

       <b>-keyex</b>|<b>-keysig</b>
           Specifies that the private key is to be used for key exchange or just signing.  This option  is  only
           interpreted by MSIE and similar MS software. Normally "export grade" software will only allow 512 bit
           RSA keys to be used for encryption purposes but arbitrary length keys for signing. The <b>-keysig</b> option
           marks  the  key  for  signing  only.  Signing  only keys can be used for S/MIME signing, authenticode
           (ActiveX control signing)  and SSL client authentication, however, due to a bug  only  MSIE  5.0  and
           later support the use of signing only keys for SSL client authentication.

       <b>-keypbe</b> <u>alg</u>, <b>-certpbe</b> <u>alg</u>
           These  options  allow  the algorithm used to encrypt the private key and certificates to be selected.
           Any PKCS#5 v1.5 or PKCS#12 PBE algorithm name can be used (see "NOTES" section for more information).
           If a cipher name (as output by "openssl list -cipher-algorithms") is specified then it is  used  with
           PKCS#5 v2.0. For interoperability reasons it is advisable to only use PKCS#12 algorithms.

           Special value "NONE" disables encryption of the private key and certificates.

       <b>-descert</b>
           Encrypt  the  certificates  using  triple  DES.  By  default the private key and the certificates are
           encrypted using AES-256-CBC unless the '-legacy' option is used.  If  '-descert'  is  used  with  the
           '-legacy' then both, the private key and the certificates are encrypted using triple DES.

       <b>-macalg</b> <u>digest</u>
           Specify the MAC digest algorithm. If not included SHA256 will be used.

       <b>-pbmac1_pbkdf2</b>
           Use PBMAC1 with PBKDF2 for MAC protection of the PKCS#12 file.

       <b>-pbmac1_pbkdf2_md</b> <u>digest</u>
           Specify   the  PBKDF2  KDF  digest  algorithm.  If  not  specified,  SHA256  will  be  used.   Unless
           "-pbmac1_pbkdf2" is specified, this parameter is ignored.

       <b>-iter</b> <u>count</u>
           This option specifies the iteration count for the encryption key and MAC. The default value is 2048.

           To discourage attacks by using large dictionaries of common passwords the algorithm that derives keys
           from passwords can have an iteration count applied to it: this causes a certain part of the algorithm
           to be repeated and slows it down. The MAC is used to check the  file  integrity  but  since  it  will
           normally have the same password as the keys and certificates it could also be attacked.

       <b>-noiter</b>, <b>-nomaciter</b>
           By  default both encryption and MAC iteration counts are set to 2048, using these options the MAC and
           encryption iteration counts can be set to 1, since this reduces the file security you should not  use
           these  options  unless  you  really have to. Most software supports both MAC and encryption iteration
           counts.  MSIE 4.0 doesn't support MAC iteration counts so it needs the <b>-nomaciter</b> option.

       <b>-maciter</b>
           This option is included for compatibility with previous versions, it used to be  needed  to  use  MAC
           iterations counts but they are now used by default.

       <b>-macsaltlen</b>
           This  option  specifies  the  salt length in bytes for the MAC. The salt length should be at least 16
           bytes as per NIST SP 800-132. The default value is 8 bytes for backwards compatibility.

       <b>-nomac</b>
           Do not attempt to provide the MAC integrity. This can be useful with the FIPS provider as the  PKCS12
           MAC  requires  PKCS12KDF  which is not an approved FIPS algorithm and cannot be supported by the FIPS
           provider.

       <b>-jdktrust</b>
           Export pkcs12 file in a format compatible with Java keystore usage.  This  option  accepts  a  string
           parameter  indicating  the  trust  oid  name  to be granted to the certificate it is associated with.
           Currently only "anyExtendedKeyUsage" is defined. Note that, as Java keystores do  not  accept  PKCS12
           files  with  both  trusted  certificates  and keypairs, use of this option implies the setting of the
           <b>-nokeys</b> option

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Although there are a large number of options most of them are very rarely used. For PKCS#12 file  parsing
       only <b>-in</b> and <b>-out</b> need to be used for PKCS#12 file creation <b>-export</b> and <b>-name</b> are also used.

       If none of the <b>-clcerts</b>, <b>-cacerts</b> or <b>-nocerts</b> options are present then all certificates will be output in
       the  order  they  appear  in  the  input  PKCS#12 files. There is no guarantee that the first certificate
       present is the one corresponding to the private key.  Certain software which tries to get a  private  key
       and  the  corresponding  certificate  might  assume  that  the  first  certificate in the file is the one
       corresponding to the private key, but that may not always be the case.  Using the  <b>-clcerts</b>  option  will
       solve  this  problem  by  only  outputting  the  certificate  corresponding to the private key. If the CA
       certificates are required then they can be output to a separate file using the <b>-nokeys</b>  <b>-cacerts</b>  options
       to just output CA certificates.

       The  <b>-keypbe</b>  and  <b>-certpbe</b>  algorithms  allow  the  precise  encryption  algorithms for private keys and
       certificates to be specified. Normally the defaults are  fine  but  occasionally  software  can't  handle
       triple  DES  encrypted  private  keys,  then the option <b>-keypbe</b> <u>PBE-SHA1-RC2-40</u> can be used to reduce the
       private key encryption to 40  bit  RC2.  A  complete  description  of  all  algorithms  is  contained  in
       <b><a href="../man1/openssl-pkcs8.1.html">openssl-pkcs8</a></b>(1).

       Prior  1.1  release passwords containing non-ASCII characters were encoded in non-compliant manner, which
       limited interoperability, in first hand  with  Windows.  But  switching  to  standard-compliant  password
       encoding  poses  problem  accessing  old data protected with broken encoding. For this reason even legacy
       encodings is attempted when reading the data. If you use PKCS#12 files in production application you  are
       advised  to  convert the data, because implemented heuristic approach is not MT-safe, its sole goal is to
       facilitate the data upgrade with this command.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Parse a PKCS#12 file and output it to a PEM file:

        openssl pkcs12 -in file.p12 -out file.pem

       Output only client certificates to a file:

        openssl pkcs12 -in file.p12 -clcerts -out file.pem

       Don't encrypt the private key:

        openssl pkcs12 -in file.p12 -out file.pem -noenc

       Print some info about a PKCS#12 file:

        openssl pkcs12 -in file.p12 -info -noout

       Print some info about a PKCS#12 file in legacy mode:

        openssl pkcs12 -in file.p12 -info -noout -legacy

       Create a PKCS#12 file from a PEM file that may contain a key and certificates:

        openssl pkcs12 -export -in file.pem -out file.p12 -name "My PSE"

       Include some extra certificates:

        openssl pkcs12 -export -in file.pem -out file.p12 -name "My PSE" \
         -certfile othercerts.pem

       Export a PKCS#12 file with data from a certificate PEM file and from a further PEM file containing a key,
       with default algorithms as in the legacy provider:

        openssl pkcs12 -export -in cert.pem -inkey key.pem -out file.p12 -legacy
