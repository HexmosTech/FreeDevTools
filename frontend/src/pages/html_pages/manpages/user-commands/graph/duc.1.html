</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>duc</b> - index, query and graph disk usage

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>duc</b> <u>subcommand</u> <u>options</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Duc is a collection of tools for inspecting and visualizing disk usage.

       Duc maintains an indexed database of accumulated sizes of directories of your file system, and allows you
       to query this database with some tools, or create fancy sunburst graphs to show you where your bytes are.

       Duc  scales  quite  well,  it  has  been  tested  on systems with more then 500 million files and several
       petabytes of storage.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Duc comes with a command line tool called <b>duc</b>, which is used to create, maintain and query the disk usage
       database. run <b>duc</b> <b>help</b> to get a list of available commands. <b>duc</b> <b>help</b> <b>&lt;subcommand&gt;</b> describes the usage  of
       a specific subcommand. Run <b>duc</b> <b>help</b> <b>--all</b> for an extensive list of all commands and their options.

       Some  commands  might  not  be available on your system, depending on the exact configuration chosen when
       building Duc. (For example, the <b>duc</b> <b>gui</b> command is not available in the <b>duc-nox</b>  package  on  Debian  and
       Ubuntu)

       Duc  allows any option to be placed either on the command line or in a configuration file. Options on the
       command line are preceded by a double-leading-dash (<b>--option</b>), some options have  a  corresponding  short
       option which can be used as well with a single leading dash. (<b>-o</b>)

       At startup duc tries to read its configuration from three locations in this particular order: <b>/etc/ducrc</b>,
       <b><a href="file:~/.config/duc/ducrc">~/.config/duc/ducrc</a></b>, <b><a href="file:~/.ducrc">~/.ducrc</a></b> and <b>./.ducrc</b>.

       A  configuration  file  consists  of  sections  and  parameters.  The section names correspond to the duc
       subcommands for which the parameters in that section apply. A section begins with the name of the section
       in square brackets and continues until the next section begins.  Sections  contain  parameters,  one  per
       line,  which consist of a single option name for boolean flags, or an option name and a value for options
       which take a value. See the EXAMPLES section for an example of the configuration file format.

</pre><h4><b>CREATING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>INDEX</b></h4><pre>
       Duc needs an index file of the file system before it is able to  show  any  information.  To  create  the
       index, run the <b>duc</b> <b>index</b> command. For example, to create an index of your home directory run <b>duc</b> <b>index</b> <b>~</b>

           $ duc index <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>
           Skipping lost+found: Permission denied
           Indexed 333823 files and 48200 directories, (35.0GB total) in 1 seconds

       The  default  location  of  the  database is <b>$HOME/.duc.db</b>. To use a different database location, use the
       DUC_DATABASE environment variable or specify the database location with the --database argument.

       You can run <b>duc</b> <b>index</b> at any time later to rebuild the index.

       By default Duc indexes all directories it encounters during file system traversal, including special file
       systems like <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> and <a href="file:/sys">/sys</a>, and network file systems like NFS or Samba mounts. There are a  few  options
       to  select  what  parts  of  your  filesystem  you  want  to  include or exclude from the scan, check the
       documentation below for the options --one-file-system, --exclude, --fs-exclude and --fs-include for  more
       details.

</pre><h4><b>QUERYING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>INDEX</b></h4><pre>
       Duc  has  various  subcommands  for  querying  or  exploring  the  index:  (Note  that  depending on your
       configuration, some of these commands might not be available)

       ○   <b>duc</b> <b>info</b> shows a list of available directory trees in the database, and the time and date of the last
           scan.

       ○   <b>duc</b> <b>ls</b> lists all files and directories under the given path on the console.

       ○   <b>duc</b> <b>ui</b> runs a ncurses based console user interface for exploring the file system usage.

       ○   <b>duc</b> <b>gui</b> starts a graphical (X11) interface representing the file system in a sunburst graph. Click on
           a directory to redraw the graph from the perspective of the selected directory. Click in  the  center
           of the graph to go up one directory in the tree.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This section list all available subcommands and describes their usage and options.

   <b>Global</b> <b>options</b>
       These options apply to all Duc subcommands:

              increase verbosity to debug level

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              show help

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
              show complete help for all commands

   <b>duc</b> <b>index</b>
       The  'index' subcommand performs a recursive scan of the given paths on the filesystem and calculates the
       inclusive size of all directories. The results are written to the index, and can later be queried by  one
       of the other duc tools.

       Options for command <b>duc</b> <b>index</b> <b>[options]</b> <b>PATH</b> <b>...</b>:

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--bytes</b>
              show file size in exact number of bytes

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--database=VAL</b>
              use database file VAL

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--exclude=VAL</b>
              exclude files matching VAL

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--check-hard-links</b>
              count hard links only once. if two or more hard links point to the same file, only one of the hard
              links is displayed and counted

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
              force writing in case of corrupted db

       <b>--fs-exclude=VAL</b>
              exclude  file  system type VAL during indexing. VAL is a comma separated list of file system types
              as found in your systems fstab, for example ext3,ext4,dosfs

       <b>--fs-include=VAL</b>
              include file system type VAL during indexing. VAL is a comma separated list of file  system  types
              as found in your systems fstab, for example ext3,ext4,dosfs

       <b>--hide-file-names</b>
              hide  file  names in index (privacy). the names of directories will be preserved, but the names of
              the individual files will be hidden

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--uid=VAL</b>
              limit index to only files/dirs owned by uid

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--username=VAL</b>
              limit index to only files/dirs owned by username

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--max-depth=VAL</b>
              limit directory names to given depth. when this option is given duc  will  traverse  the  complete
              file  system, but will only the first VAL levels of directories in the database to reduce the size
              of the index

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--one-file-system</b>
              skip directories on different file systems

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--progress</b>

              do not update database, just crawl

       <b>--uncompressed</b>
              do not use compression for database. Duc enables compression if the underlying  database  supports
              this. This reduces index size at the cost of slightly longer indexing time

</pre><h4><b>CGI</b> <b>INTERFACING</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>duc</b>  binary  has support for a rudimentary CGI interface, currently only tested with apache. The CGI
       interface generates a simple HTML page with a list of indexed directories, and shows  a  clickable  graph
       for  navigating  the  file  system. If the option <b>--list</b> is given, a list of top sized files/dirs is also
       written.

       Configuration is done by creating a simple shell script as .cgi in a directory which  is  configured  for
       CGI  execution  by  your web server (usually <b>/usr/lib/cgi-bin</b>). The shell script should simply start duc,
       and pass the location of the database to navigate.

       An example duc.cgi script would be

           #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
           /usr/local/bin/duc cgi -d /home/jenny/.duc.db

       ○   Make sure the database file is readable by the user (usually www-data)

       ○   Debugging is best done by inspecting the web server's error log

       ○   Make sure the .cgi script has execute permissions (<b>chmod</b> <b>+x</b> <b>duc.cgi</b>)

       Some notes:

       ○   The HTML page is generated with a simple embedded CSS style sheet. If the style is not to your liking
           you can provide an external CSS url with the --css-url option which will then be used instead of  the
           embedded style definition.

       ○   Add the option --list to generate a table of top sized files and directories in the HTML page.

       ○   The options --header and --footer allow you to insert your own HTML code before and after the main.

       The  current  CGI  configuration  is not very flexible, nor secure. It is not advised to run the CGI from
       public reachable web servers, use at your own risk.

</pre><h4><b>A</b> <b>NOTE</b> <b>ON</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>SIZE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DISK</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The concepts of 'file size' and 'disk usage' can be a bit confusing. Files on disk have an apparent size,
       which indicates how much bytes are in the file from the users point of view; this is the size reported by
       tools like <b>ls</b> <b>-l</b>. The apparent size can be any number, from 0 bytes up to several TB. The  actual  number
       of  bytes  which  are  used  on the filesystem to store the file can differ from this apparent size for a
       number of reasons: disks store data in blocks, which cause files to always take  up  a  multiple  of  the
       block  size,  files can have holes ('sparse' files), and other technical reasons. This number is always a
       multiple of 512, which means that the actual size used for a file is almost always a bit  more  then  its
       apparent size.

       Duc has two modes for counting file sizes:

       ○   <b>apparent</b>  <b>size</b>:  this  is the size as reported by <b>ls</b>. This number indicates the file length, which is
           usually smaller then the actual disk usage.

       ○   <b>actual</b> <b>size</b>: this is the size as reported by <b>du</b> and <b>df</b>. The actual file size tells you how much  disk
           is actually used by a file, and is always a multiple of 512 bytes.

       The default mode used by duc is to use the 'actual size'. Most duc commands to report disk usage (<b>duc</b> <b>ls</b>,
       <b>duc</b> <b>graph</b>, <b>duc</b> <b>ui</b>, etc) have an option to change between these two modes (usually the <b>-a</b>), or use the 'a'
       key to toggle.

</pre><h4><b>BUILDING</b> <b>from</b> <b>git</b></h4><pre>
       If you use git clone to pull down the latest release, you will have to do the following:

       git clone https://github.com/zevv/duc
       cd duc
       autoreconf -i

       Then you can run the regular

       ./configure [ options ]
       make

       to the regular build of the software.

       A  note  for Redhat and derivates users. The package providing the development file for lmdb (lmdb-devel)
       does not include a lmdb.pc pkgconfig file. This could lead to errors during the configure phase:

       checking for LMDB... no
       configure: error: Package requirements (lmdb) were not met:

       To avoid the need to call pkg-config, you may set the environment variables
       LMDB_CFLAGS and LMDB_LIBS:

       LMDB_CFLAGS=" " LMDB_LIBS=-llmdb ./configure --with-db-backend=lmdb [ options ]

       Start the graphical interface to explore the file system using sunburst graphs:

           $ duc gui <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>

       Generate a graph of <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a> in .png format:

           $ duc graph -o /tmp/usr.png <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>

       The following sample configuration file defines default parameters for the <b>duc</b> <b>ls</b> and <b>duc</b> <b>ui</b> commands and
       defines a global option to configure the database path which is used by all subcommands

           [global]
           database /var/cache/duc.db

           [ls]
           recursive
           classify
           color

</pre><h4><b>FREQUENTLY</b> <b>ASKED</b> <b>QUESTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       ○   What does the error 'Database version mismatch mean?'

           The layout of the index database sometimes changes when new features are implemented.  When  you  get
           this  error  you  have  probably  upgraded  to a newer version. Just remove the old database file and
           rebuild the index.

       ○   Duc crashes with a segmentation fault, is it that buggy?

           By default Duc uses the Tokyocabinet database  backend.  Tokyocabinet  is  pretty  fast,  stores  the
           database in a single file and has nice compression support to keep the database small. Unfortunately,
           it  is  not  always robust and sometimes chokes on corrupt database files. Try to remove the database
           and rebuild the index. If the error persists contact the authors.

       ○   Some of the Duc subcommands like <b>duc</b> <b>gui</b> are not available on my system?

           Depending on the configuration that was chosen when building Duc, some options might or might not  be
           available  in the <b>duc</b> utility. For example, on Debian or Ubuntu Duc comes in two flavours: there is a
           full featured package called <b>duc</b>, or a package without dependencies on X-windows called <b>duc-nox</b>,  for
           which the latter lacks the <b>duc</b> <b>gui</b> command.

       ○   <b>duc</b> <b>index</b> is hogging my system and using a lot of CPU and I/O!

           Traversing  a file system is hard work - which is the exact reason why Duc exists in the first place.
           You can use the default tools to make Duc behave nice towards other processes on  your  machine,  use
           something like:

           <b>nice</b> <b>19</b> <b>ionice</b> <b>-c</b> <b>3</b> <b>duc</b> <b>index</b> <b>[options]</b>

           This  makes <b>duc</b> <b>index</b> run with the lowest CPU and I/O scheduler priorities, which is nicer to all the
           other processes on your machine.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       At startup duc tries to read its configuration from three locations in this particular order: <b>/etc/ducrc</b>,
       <b><a href="file:~/.config/duc/ducrc">~/.config/duc/ducrc</a></b>, <b><a href="file:~/.ducrc">~/.ducrc</a></b> and <b>./.ducrc</b>.

       Duc mainains an  index  of  scanned  directories,  which  defaults  to  <a href="file:~/.duc.db.">~/.duc.db.</a>  All  tools  take  the
       -d/--database option to override the database path.
