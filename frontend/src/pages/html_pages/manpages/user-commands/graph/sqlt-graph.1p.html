</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This script will create a graph of your schema.  Only the database driver argument (for SQL::Translator)
       is required.  If no output file name is given, then image will be printed to STDOUT, so you should
       redirect the output into a file.

       The default action is to assume the presence of foreign key relationships defined via "REFERNCES" or
       "FOREIGN KEY" constraints on the tables.  If you are parsing the schema of a file that does not have
       these, you will find the natural join options helpful.  With natural joins, like-named fields will be
       considered foreign keys.  This can prove too permissive, however, as you probably don't want a field
       called "name" to be considered a foreign key, so you could include it in the "skip" option, and all
       fields called "name" will be excluded from natural joins.  A more efficient method, however, might be to
       simply deduce the foreign keys from primary keys to other fields named the same in other tables.  Use the
       "natural-join-pk" option to achieve this.

       If the schema defines foreign keys, then the graph produced will be directed showing the direction of the
       relationship.  If the foreign keys are intuited via natural joins, the graph will be undirected.

       Clustering of tables allows you to group and box tables according to function or domain or whatever
       criteria you choose.  The syntax for clustering tables is:

         cluster1=table1,table2;cluster2=table3,table4
