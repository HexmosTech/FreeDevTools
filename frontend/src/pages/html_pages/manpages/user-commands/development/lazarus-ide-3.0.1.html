</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Lazarus  -  is  a  Rapid  Application  Development  (RAD) for the Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) including an
       Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lazarus</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This binary is an integrated development environment for the <u>Free</u>  <u>Pascal</u>  <u>Compiler</u>  <u>(FPC)</u>  which  is  an
       advanced <u>Turbo</u> <u>Pascal</u> and <u>Delphi</u> <u>(7.0)</u> compatible multi-target Pascal compiler.

       The IDE uses <b><a href="../man1/FPC.1.html">FPC</a></b>(1)

       The current main supported targets are <u>Linux,</u> <u>Mac</u> <u>OS</u> <u>X,</u> <u>Freebsd,</u> and <u>Windows.</u>

       The other targets are either based on older versions of the compiler or are still in development.

       This  manpage  is  meant  for quick-reference only. Lazarus comes with an online manual, which is updated
       constantly, while this man page can be out of date.

</pre><h4><b>Usage</b></h4><pre>
       The user interface of the IDE has been designed to be similar to Delphi.  It provides  the  user  with  a
       user  friendly,  but  rather  powerful  editor,  a  form  editor,  an extensive on-line help system and a
       debugger.

       A windowing system is the base of the user interface. The user  will  usually  open  a  few  text  editor
       windows  in  which  he will design his program, during which he can regularly check and debug through the
       use of hot keys. The high speed of the compiler ensures that programmers can do this often and  therefore
       allows speedy development of code.

</pre><h4><b>Help</b> <b>files</b></h4><pre>
       No  help  files are provided by default. The user must download the Lazarus and Free Pascal documentation
       in HTML format and install it into the IDE using the Help-&gt;Configure Help.  Files can also  be  installed
       in this menu and can be useful for source code that ships with HTML files as documentation.
