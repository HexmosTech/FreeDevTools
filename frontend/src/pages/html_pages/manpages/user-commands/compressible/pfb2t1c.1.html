</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pfb2t1c - convert from binary PostScript Type1 into compressible .t1c t1c2pfb - convert from compressible
       .t1c to binary PostScript Type1

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pfb2t1c</b> "pfb file"

       <b>t1c2pfb</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pfb2t1c</b>  reads  a  pfb  file  and  converts it into the t1c format. The resulting single file (written to
       stdout) is not much smaller than the original pfb but more compressible. The file name of the pfb file(s)
       is/are noted in a pseudo header inside the t1c, hence one can append the  resulting  t1c  files  to  each
       other.

       <b>t1c2pfb</b> extracts fonts saved in a t1c file. The program reads from stdin and creates the PostScript Type1
       file(s).
