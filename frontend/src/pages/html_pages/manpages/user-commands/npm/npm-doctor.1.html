       <b>npm</b> <b>doctor</b> runs a set of checks to ensure that your npm installation has
       what it needs to manage your JavaScript packages. npm is mostly a
       standalone tool, but it does have some basic requirements that must be met:

        • Node.js and git must be executable by npm.

        • The primary npm registry, <b>registry.npmjs.com</b>, or another service that
          uses the registry API, is available.

        • The directories that npm uses, <b>node_modules</b> (both locally and
          globally), exist and can be written by the current user.

        • The npm cache exists, and the package tarballs within it aren't corrupt.

       Without all of these working properly, npm may not work properly.  Many
       issues are often attributable to things that are outside npm's code base,
       so <b>npm</b> <b>doctor</b> confirms that the npm installation is in a good state.

       Also, in addition to this, there are also very many issue reports due to
       using old versions of npm. Since npm is constantly improving, running
       <b>npm@latest</b> is better than an old version.

       <b>npm</b> <b>doctor</b> verifies the following items in your environment, and if
       there are any recommended changes, it will display them.  By default npm
       runs all of these checks. You can limit what checks are ran by
       specifying them as extra arguments.

   <b>npm</b> <b>ping</b>
       By default, npm installs from the primary npm registry,
       <b>registry.npmjs.org</b>.  <b>npm</b> <b>doctor</b> hits a special ping endpoint within the
       registry. This can also be checked with <b>npm</b> <b>ping</b>. If this check fails,
       you may be using a proxy that needs to be configured, or may need to talk
       to your IT staff to get access over HTTPS to <b>registry.npmjs.org</b>.

       This check is done against whichever registry you've configured (you can
       see what that is by running <b>npm</b> <b>config</b> <b>get</b> <b>registry</b>), and if you're using
       a private registry that doesn't support the <b>/whoami</b> endpoint supported by
       the primary registry, this check may fail.

   <b>npm</b> <b>-v</b>
       While Node.js may come bundled with a particular version of npm, it's the
       policy of the CLI team that we recommend all users run <b>npm@latest</b> if they
       can. As the CLI is maintained by a small team of contributors, there are
       only resources for a single line of development, so npm's own long-term
       support releases typically only receive critical security and regression
       fixes. The team believes that the latest tested version of npm is almost
       always likely to be the most functional and defect-free version of npm.

   <b>node</b> <b>-v</b>
       For most users, in most circumstances, the best version of Node will be the
       latest long-term support (LTS) release. Those of you who want access to new
       ECMAscript features or bleeding-edge changes to Node's standard library may
       be running a newer version, and some may be required to run an older
       version of Node because of enterprise change control policies. That's OK!
       But in general, the npm team recommends that most users run Node.js LTS.

   <b>npm</b> <b>config</b> <b>get</b> <b>registry</b>
       You may be installing from private package registries for your project or
       company. That's great! Others may be following tutorials or StackOverflow
       questions in an effort to troubleshoot problems you may be having.
       Sometimes, this may entail changing the registry you're pointing at.  This
       part of <b>npm</b> <b>doctor</b> just lets you, and maybe whoever's helping you with
       support, know that you're not using the default registry.

   <b>which</b> <b>git</b>
       While it's documented in the README, it may not be obvious that npm needs
       Git installed to do many of the things that it does. Also, in some cases
       – especially on Windows – you may have Git set up in such a way that it's
       not accessible via your <b>PATH</b> so that npm can find it. This check ensures
       that Git is available.

   <b>Permissions</b> <b>checks</b>
        • Your cache must be readable and writable by the user running npm.

        • Global package binaries must be writable by the user running npm.

        • Your local <b>node_modules</b> path, if you're running <b>npm</b> <b>doctor</b> with a
          project directory, must be readable and writable by the user running npm.

   <b>Validate</b> <b>the</b> <b>checksums</b> <b>of</b> <b>cached</b> <b>packages</b>
       When an npm package is published, the publishing process generates a
       checksum that npm uses at install time to verify that the package didn't
       get corrupted in transit. <b>npm</b> <b>doctor</b> uses these checksums to validate the
       package tarballs in your local cache (you can see where that cache is
       located with <b>npm</b> <b>config</b> <b>get</b> <b>cache</b>). In the event that there are corrupt
       packages in your cache, you should probably run <b>npm</b> <b>cache</b> <b>clean</b> <b>-f</b> and
       reset the cache.
