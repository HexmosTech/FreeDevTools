</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform.  It puts
       modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency
       conflicts intelligently.

       It is extremely configurable to support a variety of use cases.  Most
       commonly, you use it to publish, discover, install, and develop node
       programs.

       Run <b>npm</b> <b>help</b> to get a list of available commands.

</pre><h4><b>Important</b></h4><pre>
       npm comes preconfigured to use npm's public registry at
       https://registry.npmjs.orgby default. Use of the npm public registry is
       subject to terms of use available at
       https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/terms

       You can configure npm to use any compatible registry you like, and even
       run your own registry. Use of someone else's registry is governed by
       their terms of use.

</pre><h4><b>Introduction</b></h4><pre>
       You probably got npm because you want to install stuff.

       The very first thing you will most likely want to run in any node
       program is <b>npm</b> <b>install</b> to install its dependencies.

       You can also run <b>npm</b> <b>install</b> <b>blerg</b> to install the latest version of
       "blerg".  Check out <b>npm</b> <b>install</b> for more
       info.  It can do a lot of stuff.

       Use the <b>npm</b> <b>search</b> command to show everything that's available in the
       public registry.  Use <b>npm</b> <b>ls</b> to show everything you've installed.

</pre><h4><b>Dependencies</b></h4><pre>
       If a package lists a dependency using a git URL, npm will install that
       dependency using the <b>git</b>
       command and will generate an error if it is not installed.

       If one of the packages npm tries to install is a native node module and
       requires compiling of C++ Code, npm will use
       node-gyp for that task.
       For a Unix system, node-gyp
       needs Python, make and a buildchain like GCC. On Windows,
       Python and Microsoft Visual Studio C++ are needed. For more information
       visit the node-gyp repository and
       the node-gyp Wiki.

</pre><h4><b>Directories</b></h4><pre>
       See <b>folders</b> to learn about where npm puts
       stuff.

       In particular, npm has two modes of operation:

        • local mode:
          npm installs packages into the current project directory, which
          defaults to the current working directory.  Packages install to
          <b>./node_modules</b>, and bins to <b>./node_modules/.bin</b>.

        • global mode:
          npm installs packages into the install prefix at
          <b>$npm_config_prefix/lib/node_modules</b> and bins to
          <b>$npm_config_prefix/bin</b>.

       Local mode is the default.  Use <b>-g</b> or <b>--global</b> on any command to
       run in global mode instead.

</pre><h4><b>Developer</b> <b>Usage</b></h4><pre>
       If you're using npm to develop and publish your code, check out the
       following help topics:

        • json:
          Make a package.json file.  See
          <b>package.json</b>.

        • link:
          Links your current working code into Node's path, so that you don't
          have to reinstall every time you make a change.  Use <b>npm</b> <b>link</b> to do this.

        • install:
          It's a good idea to install things if you don't need the symbolic
          link.  Especially, installing other peoples code from the registry is
          done via <b>npm</b> <b>install</b>

        • adduser:
          Create an account or log in.  When you do this, npm will store
          credentials in the user config file.

        • publish:
          Use the <b>npm</b> <b>publish</b> command to upload your
          code to the registry.

   <b>Configuration</b>
       npm is extremely configurable.  It reads its configuration options from
       5 places.

        • Command line switches:
          Set a config with <b>--key</b> <b>val</b>.  All keys take a value, even if they
          are booleans (the config parser doesn't know what the options are at
          the time of parsing).  If you do not provide a value (<b>--key</b>) then
          the option is set to boolean <b>true</b>.

        • Environment Variables:
          Set any config by prefixing the name in an environment variable with
          <b>npm_config_</b>.  For example, <b>export</b> <b>npm_config_key=val</b>.

        • User Configs:
          The file at <b>$HOME/.npmrc</b> is an ini-formatted list of configs.  If
          present, it is parsed.  If the <b>userconfig</b> option is set in the cli
          or env, that file will be used instead.

        • Global Configs:
          The file found at <b>./etc/npmrc</b> (relative to the global prefix will be
          parsed if it is found.  See <b>npm</b> <b>prefix</b> for
          more info on the global prefix.  If the <b>globalconfig</b> option is set
          in the cli, env, or user config, then that file is parsed instead.

        • Defaults:
          npm's default configuration options are defined in
          lib/utils/config-defs.js.  These must not be changed.

       See <b>config</b> for much much more information.
