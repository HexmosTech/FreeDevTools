</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       This command will print to stdout all the versions of packages that are
       installed, as well as their dependencies when <b>--all</b> is specified, in a
       tree structure.

       Note: to get a "bottoms up" view of why a given package is included in the
       tree at all, use <b>npm</b> <b>explain</b>.

       Positional arguments are <b>name@version-range</b> identifiers, which will limit
       the results to only the paths to the packages named.  Note that nested
       packages will <u>also</u> show the paths to the specified packages.  For
       example, running <b>npm</b> <b>ls</b> <b>promzard</b> in npm's source tree will show:
         npm@@VERSION@ /path/to/npm
         └─┬ <a href="mailto:init-package-json@0.0.4">init-package-json@0.0.4</a>
           └── <a href="mailto:promzard@0.1.5">promzard@0.1.5</a>

       It will print out extraneous, missing, and invalid packages.

       If a project specifies git urls for dependencies these are shown
       in parentheses after the <b>name@version</b> to make it easier for users to
       recognize potential forks of a project.

       The tree shown is the logical dependency tree, based on package
       dependencies, not the physical layout of your <b>node_modules</b> folder.

       When run as <b>ll</b> or <b>la</b>, it shows extended information by default.

</pre><h4><b>Note:</b> <b>Design</b> <b>Changes</b> <b>Pending</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>npm</b> <b>ls</b> command's output and behavior made a <u>ton</u> of sense when npm
       created a <b>node_modules</b> folder that naively nested every dependency.  In
       such a case, the logical dependency graph and physical tree of packages on
       disk would be roughly identical.

       With the advent of automatic install-time deduplication of dependencies in
       npm v3, the <b>ls</b> output was modified to display the logical dependency
       graph as a tree structure, since this was more useful to most users.
       However, without using <b>npm</b> <b>ls</b> <b>-l</b>, it became impossible to show <u>where</u> a
       package was actually installed much of the time!

       With the advent of automatic installation of <b>peerDependencies</b> in npm v7,
       this gets even more curious, as <b>peerDependencies</b> are logically
       "underneath" their dependents in the dependency graph, but are always
       physically at or above their location on disk.

       Also, in the years since npm got an <b>ls</b> command (in version 0.0.2!),
       dependency graphs have gotten much larger as a general rule.  Therefore, in
       order  to  avoid  dumping  an  excessive amount of content to the terminal, <b>npm</b> <b>ls</b> now only shows the <u>top</u>
       level dependencies, unless <b>--all</b> is
       provided.

       A thorough re-examination of the use cases, intention, behavior, and output
       of this command, is currently underway.  Expect significant changes to at
       least the default human-readable <b>npm</b> <b>ls</b> output in npm v8.
