</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sfeed_curses — curses UI for viewing feed data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sfeed_curses</b> [<u>file</u> <u>...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sfeed_curses</b>  formats feed data (TSV) from <u><a href="../man1/sfeed.1.html">sfeed</a></u>(1) from stdin or for each <u>file</u> into a curses UI.  If one
       or more <u>file</u> arguments are specified then the basename of the <u>file</u> is used as the feed name in the output
       such as the feeds sidebar.  The <u>file</u> arguments are processed and shown in the specified argument order in
       the feeds sidebar.  If no <u>file</u> arguments are specified then the data is read from stdin and the feed name
       is "stdin" and no sidebar is visible by default in this case.

       Items with a timestamp from the last day compared to the system time at the time of loading the feed  are
       marked  as new and bold.  This value might be overridden through environment variables.  There is also an
       alternative mode available to mark items as read by matching it against a list of URLs from a  plain-text
       file.  Items with an enclosure are marked with a @ symbol.

       <b>sfeed_curses</b> aligns the output.  Make sure the environment variable LC_CTYPE is set to a UTF-8 locale, so
       it can determine the proper column-width per rune, using <u><a href="../man3/mbtowc.3.html">mbtowc</a></u>(3) and <u><a href="../man3/wcwidth.3.html">wcwidth</a></u>(3).

</pre><h4><b>KEYBINDS</b></h4><pre>

       K       Go to the previous bold row.

       J       Go to the next bold row.

       h, ARROW LEFT
               Focus feeds pane.

       l, ARROW RIGHT
               Focus items pane.

       TAB     Cycle focused pane (between feeds and items).

       g       Go to the first row.

       G       Go to the last row.

       PAGE UP, CTRL-B
               Scroll one page up.

       PAGE DOWN, CTRL-F, SPACE
               Scroll one page down.

       /       Prompt for a new search and search forward (case-insensitive).

       ?       Prompt for a new search and search backward (case-insensitive).

       n       Search forward with the previously set search term.

       N       Search backward with the previously set search term.

       [       Go to the previous feed in the feeds pane and open it.

       ]       Go to the next feed in the feeds pane and open it.

       CTRL-L  Redraw screen.

       R       Reload all feed files which were specified as arguments on startup.  If SFEED_URL_FILE is set, it
               will reload the URLs from this file also.

       m       Toggle mouse-mode.  It supports xterm X10 and extended SGR encoding.

       s       Toggle between monocle layout and the previous non-monocle layout.

       &lt;       Use  a  fixed  sidebar  size  for  the current layout and decrease the fixed width or height by 1
               column.

       &gt;       Use a fixed sidebar size for the current layout and increase the  fixed  width  or  height  by  1
               column.

       =       Reset  the sidebar size to automatically adjust for the current layout.  With the vertical layout
               the width is the longest feed name with the  item  counts  right-aligned.   With  the  horizontal
               layout  the  height  is  half  of the window height (minus the status bar) or otherwise the total
               amount of visible feeds, whichever fits the best.

       t       Toggle showing only feeds with new items in the sidebar.

       a, e, @
               Plumb URL of the enclosure.  The URL is passed  as  a  parameter  to  the  program  specified  in
               SFEED_PLUMBER.

       o, ENTER, RETURN
               Feeds pane: load feed and its items.  In the monocle layout it will also switch to the items pane
               after  loading  the  feed  items.   Items  pane:  plumb  current item URL, the URL is passed as a
               parameter to the program specified in SFEED_PLUMBER.

       c, p, |
               Pipe the whole TAB-Separated Value line to  a  program.   This  program  can  be  specified  with
               SFEED_PIPER.

       y       Pipe  the  TAB-Separated  Value  field  for  yanking  the  URL to a program.  This program can be
               specified with SFEED_YANKER.

       E       Pipe the TAB-Separated Value field for yanking the enclosure to a program.  This program  can  be
               specified with SFEED_YANKER.

       r       Mark item as read.  This will only work when SFEED_URL_FILE is set.

       u       Mark item as unread.  This will only work when SFEED_URL_FILE is set.

       f       Mark  all items of the currently loaded feed as read.  This will only work when SFEED_URL_FILE is
               set.

       F       Mark all items of the currently loaded feed as unread.  This will only work  when  SFEED_URL_FILE
               is set.

       1       Set  the  current  layout  to  a vertical mode.  Showing a feeds sidebar to the left and the feed
               items to the right.

       2       Set the current layout to a horizontal mode.  Showing a feeds sidebar on the  top  and  the  feed
               items on the bottom.

       3       Set the current layout to a monocle mode.  Showing either a feeds or a feed items pane.

       q, EOF  Quit

</pre><h4><b>MOUSE</b> <b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       When mouse-mode is enabled the below actions are available.

       LEFT-CLICK
               Feeds pane: select and load the feed and its items.  In the monocle layout it will also switch to
               the items pane after loading the feed items.  Items pane: select item, when already selected then
               plumb it.

       RIGHT-CLICK
               Feeds pane: select feed, but do not load it.  Items pane: pipe the item.

       SCROLL UP
               Scroll one page up.

       SCROLL DOWN
               Scroll one page down.

       FORWARD
               Switch to the items pane.

       BACKWARD
               Switch to the feeds pane.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       SIGHUP  Reload all feed files which were specified as arguments on startup.  If SFEED_URL_FILE is set, it
               will  reload  the  URLs  from  this file also.  Cancels the line editor and handles the signal if
               received during a search.

       SIGINT  Interrupt: quit.  When searching, it only cancels the line editor and doesn't quit.

       SIGTERM
               Quit

       SIGWINCH
               Resize the pane dimensions relative to the terminal size.  When searching, it handles the  signal
               after closing the line editor.

       Signals are handled in the following order: SIGCHLD, SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP, SIGWINCH.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       SFEED_AUTOCMD
               Read  and  process  a  sequence  of  keys as input commands from this environment variable first,
               afterwards it reads from the tty as usual.  This can be useful to automate certain actions at the
               start.

       SFEED_NEW_AGE
               Overwrite the maximum age in seconds to mark feeds as new.   By  default  this  is  86400,  which
               equals one day.

       SFEED_PIPER
               A  program  where  the  whole  TAB-Separated  Value  line  is  piped  to.   By  default  this  is
               "sfeed_content".

       SFEED_PIPER_INTERACTIVE
               Handle the program interactively in the same terminal or not.  By default this is set to "1".

       SFEED_PLUMBER
               A program that receives the link URL or enclosure URL as a parameter.  By default this  is  "xdg-
               open".

       SFEED_PLUMBER_INTERACTIVE
               Handle  the program interactively in the same terminal or not.  This option can be useful to open
               a text-mode browser in the same terminal.  By default this is set to "0".

       SFEED_YANKER
               A program where the URL or enclosure field is piped to, to copy it to a  clipboard.   By  default
               this is "xclip -r".

       SFEED_YANKER_INTERACTIVE
               Handle the program interactively in the same terminal or not.  By default this is set to "0".

       SFEED_URL_FILE
               If  this variable is set then a different mode is used to mark items as read, instead of checking
               the timestamp, which is the default.  The value specified is a plain-text file containing a  list
               of read URLs, one URL per line.  This URL is matched on the link field if it is set, otherwise it
               is matched on the id field.

       SFEED_MARK_READ
               A  program to mark items as read if SFEED_URL_FILE is also set, if unset the default program used
               is "sfeed_markread read".  The marked items are piped to the program line by line.  If  the  feed
               item  has  a link then this line is the link field, otherwise it is the id field.  The program is
               expected to merge items in a safe/transactional manner.   The  program  should  return  the  exit
               status 0 on success or non-zero on failure.

       SFEED_MARK_UNREAD
               A  program  to  mark  items as unread if SFEED_URL_FILE is also set, if unset the default program
               used is "sfeed_markread unread".  The unmarked items are piped to the program line by  line.   If
               the  feed  item  has  a link then this line is the link field, otherwise it is the id field.  The
               program is expected to merge items in a safe/transactional manner.  The program should return the
               exit status 0 on success or non-zero on failure.

       SFEED_LAZYLOAD
               Lazyload items when reading the feed data from files.  This can reduce memory usage but increases
               latency when seeking items, especially on slower disk drives.  It can also cause a race-condition
               issue if the feed data on disk is changed while having the UI open and offsets for the lines  are
               different.   A  workaround  for  the  race-condition  issue  is  by  sending the SIGHUP signal to
               <b>sfeed_curses</b> after the data was updated.  This makes <b>sfeed_curses</b> reload the latest feed data and
               update the correct line offsets.  By default this is set to "0".

       SFEED_FEED_PATH
               This variable is set by <b>sfeed_curses</b> when a feed is loaded.  If the data was read from stdin this
               variable is unset.  It can be used by the plumb or pipe program for scripting purposes.

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTIVE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>NON-INTERACTIVE</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sfeed_curses</b> can pipe content,  plumb  and  yank  interactively  or  in  a  non-interactive  manner.   In
       interactive  mode  <b>sfeed_curses</b>  waits  until  the  process  exits.  Stdout and stderr of the program are
       written as output.  It stores and restores  the  terminal  attributes  before  and  after  executing  the
       program.   The  signals SIGHUP and SIGWINCH will be handled after <b>sfeed_curses</b> has waited on the program.
       SIGINT is ignored while waiting on the program.

       In non-interactive mode <b>sfeed_curses</b> doesn't wait until the process exits.   Stdout  and  stderr  of  the
       program are not written as output.  When plumbing an URL then stdin is closed also.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>sfeed_curses</b> utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.  The exit status is 130 on SIGINT
       and 143 on SIGTERM.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       sfeed_curses <a href="file:~/.sfeed/feeds/">~/.sfeed/feeds/</a>*

       Another example which shows some of the features <b>sfeed_curses</b> has:

       export SFEED_AUTOCMD="2tgo"
       export SFEED_URL_FILE="$HOME/.sfeed/urls"
       [ -f "$SFEED_URL_FILE" ] || touch "$SFEED_URL_FILE"
       sfeed_curses <a href="file:~/.sfeed/feeds/">~/.sfeed/feeds/</a>*

       Which does the following:

       1.   Set commands to execute automatically:

            Set  the  current layout to a horizontal mode ('2' keybind).  Showing a feeds sidebar on the top and
            the feed items on the bottom.

            Toggle showing only feeds with new items in the sidebar ('t' keybind).

            Go to the first row in the current panel ('g' keybind).

            Load the currently selected feed ('o' keybind).

       2.   Set a file to use for managing read and unread items.  This is a plain-text file containing  a  list
            of read URLs, one URL per line.

       3.   Check  if  this  file  for  managing the read and unread items exists.  If it doesn't exist yet then
            create an empty file.

       4.   Start <b>sfeed_curses</b> and read the specified feed files.
