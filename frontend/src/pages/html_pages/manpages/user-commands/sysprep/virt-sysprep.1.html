</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       virt-sysprep - Reset, unconfigure or customize a virtual machine so clones can be made

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        virt-sysprep [--options] -d domname

        virt-sysprep [--options] -a disk.img [-a disk.img ...]

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       Using "virt-sysprep" on live virtual machines, or concurrently with other disk editing tools, can be
       dangerous, potentially causing disk corruption.  The virtual machine must be shut down before you use
       this command, and disk images must not be edited concurrently.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Virt-sysprep can reset or unconfigure a virtual machine so that clones can be made from it.  Steps in
       this process include removing SSH host keys, removing persistent network MAC configuration, and removing
       user accounts.  Virt-sysprep can also customize a virtual machine, for instance by adding SSH keys, users
       or logos.  Each step can be enabled or disabled as required.

       Virt-sysprep modifies the guest or disk image <u>in</u> <u>place</u>.  The guest must be shut down.  If you want to
       preserve the existing contents of the guest, <u>you</u> <u>must</u> <u>snapshot,</u> <u>copy</u> <u>or</u> <u>clone</u> <u>the</u> <u>disk</u> <u>first</u>.  See
       "COPYING AND CLONING" below.

       You do <u>not</u> need to run virt-sysprep as root.  In fact we'd generally recommend that you don't.  The time
       you might want to run it as root is when you need root in order to access the disk image, but even in
       this case it would be better to change the permissions on the disk image to be writable as the non-root
       user running virt-sysprep.

       "Sysprep" stands for "system preparation" tool.  The name comes from the Microsoft program <u>sysprep.exe</u>
       which is used to unconfigure Windows machines in preparation for cloning them.  (Virt-sysprep does not
       work on Microsoft Windows guests.)

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b>
           Display brief help.

       <b>-a</b> file
       <b>--add</b> file
           Add <u>file</u> which should be a disk image from a virtual machine.

           The  format  of  the disk image is auto-detected.  To override this and force a particular format use
           the <u>--format</u> option.

       <b>-a</b> URI
       <b>--add</b> URI
           Add a remote disk.  The URI format is compatible with guestfish.   See  "ADDING  REMOTE  STORAGE"  in
           <b><a href="../man1/guestfish.1.html">guestfish</a></b>(1).

       <b>--colors</b>
       <b>--colours</b>
           Use  ANSI  colour sequences to colourize messages.  This is the default when the output is a tty.  If
           the output of the program is redirected to a file, ANSI colour sequences are disabled unless you  use
           this option.

       <b>-c</b> URI
       <b>--connect</b> URI
           If  using  libvirt,  connect  to  the  given <u>URI</u>.  If omitted, then we connect to the default libvirt
           hypervisor.

           If you specify guest block devices directly (<u>-a</u>), then libvirt is not used at all.

       <b>-d</b> guest
       <b>--domain</b> guest
           Add all the disks from the named libvirt guest.  Domain UUIDs can be used instead of names.

       <b>-n</b>
       <b>--dry-run</b>
           Perform a read-only "dry run" on the guest.  This runs the sysprep operation,  but  throws  away  any
           changes to the disk at the end.

       <b>--enable</b> operations
           Choose which sysprep operations to perform.  Give a comma-separated list of operations, for example:

            --enable ssh-hostkeys,udev-persistent-net

           would enable ONLY "ssh-hostkeys" and "udev-persistent-net" operations.

           If  the  <u>--enable</u>  option  is  not  given,  then  we  default  to trying most sysprep operations (see
           <u>--list-operations</u> to show which are enabled).

           Regardless of the <u>--enable</u> option, sysprep operations are skipped for some guest types.

           Use <u>--list-operations</u> to list operations supported by a particular version of virt-sysprep.

           See "OPERATIONS" below for a list and an explanation of each operation.

       <b>--operation</b> operations
       <b>--operations</b> operations
           Choose which sysprep operations to perform.  Give a comma-separated list of operations, for example:

            --operations ssh-hostkeys,udev-persistent-net

           would enable ONLY "ssh-hostkeys" and "udev-persistent-net" operations.

           <u>--operations</u> allows you to enable and disable any operation, including the default ones (which  would
           be  tried when specifying neither <u>--operations</u> nor <u>--enable</u>) and all the available ones; prepending a
           "-" in front of an operation name removes it from the list of enabled  operations,  while  the  meta-
           names  "defaults"  and  "all"  represent  respectively  the operations enabled by default and all the
           available ones.  For example:

            --operations firewall-rules,defaults,-tmp-files

           would enable the "firewall-rules" operation (regardless whether it is enabled by  default),  all  the
           default ones, and disable the "tmp-files" operation.

           <u>--operations</u>  can be specified multiple times; the first time the set of enabled operations is empty,
           while any further <u>--operations</u> affects the operations enabled so far.

           If the <u>--operations</u> option is not given, then we default  to  trying  most  sysprep  operations  (see
           <u>--list-operations</u> to show which are enabled).

           Regardless of the <u>--operations</u> option, sysprep operations are skipped for some guest types.

           Use <u>--list-operations</u> to list operations supported by a particular version of virt-sysprep.

           See "OPERATIONS" below for a list and an explanation of each operation.

       <b>--echo-keys</b>
           When  prompting  for  keys and passphrases, virt-sysprep normally turns echoing off so you cannot see
           what you are typing.  If you are not worried about Tempest attacks and there is no one  else  in  the
           room you can specify this flag to see what you are typing.

       <b>--format</b> raw|qcow2|..
       <b>--format</b> auto
           The  default for the <u>-a</u> option is to auto-detect the format of the disk image.  Using this forces the
           disk format for <u>-a</u> options which follow on the command line.  Using <u>--format</u> <u>auto</u>  switches  back  to
           auto-detection for subsequent <u>-a</u> options.

           For example:

            virt-sysprep --format raw -a disk.img

           forces raw format (no auto-detection) for <u>disk.img</u>.

            virt-sysprep --format raw -a disk.img --format auto -a another.img

           forces raw format (no auto-detection) for <u>disk.img</u> and reverts to auto-detection for <u>another.img</u>.

           If  you  have  untrusted raw-format guest disk images, you should use this option to specify the disk
           format.  This avoids a possible security problem with malicious guests (CVE-2010-3851).

       <b>--key</b> SELECTOR
           Specify a key for LUKS, to automatically open a LUKS device when using the inspection.

           <b>--key</b> NAME<b>:key:</b>KEY_STRING
           <b>--key</b> UUID<b>:key:</b>KEY_STRING
           <b>--key</b> <b>all:key:</b>KEY_STRING
               "NAME" is the libguestfs device name (eg. "/dev/sda1").  "UUID" is the device UUID.  "all"  means
               try the key against any encrypted device.

               Use the specified "KEY_STRING" as passphrase.

           <b>--key</b> NAME<b>:file:</b>FILENAME
           <b>--key</b> UUID<b>:file:</b>FILENAME
           <b>--key</b> <b>all:file:</b>FILENAME
               Read the passphrase from <u>FILENAME</u>.

           <b>--key</b> NAME<b>:clevis</b>
           <b>--key</b> UUID<b>:clevis</b>
           <b>--key</b> <b>all:clevis</b>
               Attempt  passphrase-less unlocking for the device with Clevis, over the network.  Please refer to
               "ENCRYPTED DISKS" in <b><a href="../man3/guestfs.3.html">guestfs</a></b>(3) for more information on network-bound disk encryption (NBDE).

               Note that if any such option is present on  the  command  line,  QEMU  user  networking  will  be
               automatically enabled for the libguestfs appliance.

       <b>--keys-from-stdin</b>
           Read  key  or  passphrase  parameters from stdin.  The default is to try to read passphrases from the
           user by opening <u>/dev/tty</u>.

           If there are multiple encrypted devices then you may need to supply multiple keys on stdin,  one  per
           line.

       <b>--list-operations</b>
           List the operations supported by the virt-sysprep program.

           These are listed one per line, with one or more single-space-separated fields, eg:

            $ virt-sysprep --list-operations
            bash-history * Remove the bash history in the guest
            cron-spool * Remove user at-jobs and cron-jobs
            dhcp-client-state * Remove DHCP client leases
            dhcp-server-state * Remove DHCP server leases
            [etc]

           The  first field is the operation name, which can be supplied to <u>--enable</u>.  The second field is a "*"
           character if the operation is enabled by default or blank if not.  Subsequent fields on the same line
           are the description of the operation.

           Before libguestfs 1.17.33 only the first (operation name) field was shown  and  all  operations  were
           enabled by default.

       <b>--mount-options</b> mp:opts[;mp:opts;...]
           Set  the  mount  options  used  when libguestfs opens the disk image.  Note this has no effect on the
           guest.  It is used when opening certain guests such as ones using the UFS (BSD) filesystem.

           Use a semicolon-separated list of "mountpoint:options" pairs.  You may need to  quote  this  list  to
           protect it from the shell.

           For example:

            --mount-options "/:noatime"

           will mount the root directory with "notime".  This example:

            --mount-options "/:noatime;<a href="file:/var">/var</a>:rw,nodiratime"

           will do the same, plus mount <u><a href="file:/var">/var</a></u> with "rw,nodiratime".

       <b>-q</b>
       <b>--quiet</b>
           Don’t print log messages.

           To enable detailed logging of individual file operations, use <u>-x</u>.

       <b>--network</b>
       <b>--no-network</b>
           Enable or disable network access from the guest during the installation.

           In  virt-sysprep,  the network is <u>disabled</u> by default.  You must use <u>--network</u> to enable it, in order
           that options such as <u>--install</u> or <u>--update</u> will work.

           <b><a href="../man1/virt-builder.1.html">virt-builder</a></b>(1) has more information about the security advantages of disabling the network.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
           Enable verbose messages for debugging.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
           Display version number and exit.

       <b>--wrap</b>
           Wrap error, warning, and informative messages.  This is the default when the output is a tty.  If the
           output of the program is redirected to a file, wrapping is disabled unless you use this option.

       <b>-x</b>  Enable tracing of libguestfs API calls.

       <b>--append-line</b> FILE:LINE (see "customize" below)
           Append a single line of text to the "FILE".  If the file does not already end with  a  newline,  then
           one  is  added  before  the  appended  line.  Also a newline is added to the end of the "LINE" string
           automatically.

           For example (assuming ordinary shell quoting) this command:

            --append-line '<a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>:10.0.0.1 foo'

           will add either "10.0.0.1 foo⏎" or "⏎10.0.0.1 foo⏎" to the file, the latter only if the existing file
           does not already end with a newline.

           "⏎" represents a newline character, which is guessed by looking at the existing content of the  file,
           so this command does the right thing for files using Unix or Windows line endings.  It also works for
           empty or non-existent files.

           To insert several lines, use the same option several times:

            --append-line '<a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>:10.0.0.1 foo'
            --append-line '<a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>:10.0.0.2 bar'

           To insert a blank line before the appended line, do:

            --append-line '<a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>:'
            --append-line '<a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>:10.0.0.1 foo'

       <b>--chmod</b> PERMISSIONS:FILE (see "customize" below)
           Change the permissions of "FILE" to "PERMISSIONS".

           <u>Note</u>:  "PERMISSIONS"  by  default would be decimal, unless you prefix it with 0 to get octal, ie. use
           0700 not 700.

       <b>--chown</b> UID:GID:PATH (see "customize" below)
           Change the owner user and group ID of a file or directory in the guest.  Note:

           •   Only numeric UIDs and GIDs will work, and these may not be the same inside the guest  as  on  the
               host.

           •   This will not work with Windows guests.

           For example:

            virt-customize --chown '0:0:/var/log/audit.log'

           See also: <u>--upload</u>.

       <b>--commands-from-file</b> FILENAME (see "customize" below)
           Read the customize commands from a file, one (and its arguments) each line.

           Each line contains a single customization command and its arguments, for example:

            delete /some/file
            install some-package
            password some-user:password:its-new-password

           Empty  lines  are  ignored,  and  lines  starting  with  "#"  are  comments  and are ignored as well.
           Furthermore, arguments can be spread across multiple lines, by adding a "\" (continuation  character)
           at the of a line, for example

            edit /some/file:\
              s/^OPT=.*/OPT=ok/

           The  commands  are  handled  in  the same order as they are in the file, as if they were specified as
           <u>--delete</u> <u>/some/file</u> on the command line.

       <b>--copy</b> SOURCE:DEST (see "customize" below)
           Copy files or directories recursively inside the guest.

           Wildcards cannot be used.

       <b>--copy-in</b> LOCALPATH:REMOTEDIR (see "customize" below)
           Copy local files or directories recursively into the  disk  image,  placing  them  in  the  directory
           "REMOTEDIR" (which must exist).

           Wildcards cannot be used.

       <b>--delete</b> PATH (see "customize" below)
           Delete a file from the guest.  Or delete a directory (and all its contents, recursively).

           You  can  use shell glob characters in the specified path.  Be careful to escape glob characters from
           the host shell, if that is required.  For example:

            virt-customize --delete '<a href="file:/var/log/">/var/log/</a>*.log'.

           See also: <u>--upload</u>, <u>--scrub</u>.

       <b>--edit</b> FILE:EXPR (see "customize" below)
           Edit "FILE" using the Perl expression "EXPR".

           Be careful to properly quote the expression to prevent it from being altered by the shell.

           Note that this option is only available when Perl 5 is installed.

           See "NON-INTERACTIVE EDITING" in <b><a href="../man1/virt-edit.1.html">virt-edit</a></b>(1).

       <b>--firstboot</b> SCRIPT (see "customize" below)
           Install "SCRIPT" inside the guest, so that when the guest first boots up, the script runs  (as  root,
           late in the boot process).

           The script is automatically chmod +x after installation in the guest.

           The  alternative version <u>--firstboot-command</u> is the same, but it conveniently wraps the command up in
           a single line script for you.

           You can have multiple <u>--firstboot</u> options.  They run in the  same  order  that  they  appear  on  the
           command line.

           Please  take a look at "FIRST BOOT SCRIPTS" in <b><a href="../man1/virt-builder.1.html">virt-builder</a></b>(1) for more information and caveats about
           the first boot scripts.

           See also <u>--run</u>.

       <b>--firstboot-command</b> 'CMD+ARGS' (see "customize" below)
           Run command (and arguments) inside the guest when the guest first boots up (as root, late in the boot
           process).

           You can have multiple <u>--firstboot</u> options.  They run in the  same  order  that  they  appear  on  the
           command line.

           Please  take a look at "FIRST BOOT SCRIPTS" in <b><a href="../man1/virt-builder.1.html">virt-builder</a></b>(1) for more information and caveats about
           the first boot scripts.

           See also <u>--run</u>.

       <b>--firstboot-install</b> PKG,PKG.. (see "customize" below)
           Install the named packages (a comma-separated list).  These are installed when the guest first  boots
           using the guest’s package manager (eg. apt, yum, etc.) and the guest’s network connection.

           For   an  overview  on  the  different  ways  to  install  packages,  see  "INSTALLING  PACKAGES"  in
           <b><a href="../man1/virt-builder.1.html">virt-builder</a></b>(1).

       <b>--hostname</b> HOSTNAME (see "customize" below)
           Set the hostname of the guest to "HOSTNAME".  You can use a dotted hostname.domainname (FQDN) if  you
           want.

       <b>--inject-qemu-ga</b> METHOD (see "customize" below)
           Inject  the  QEMU Guest Agent into a Windows guest.  The guest agent communicates with qemu through a
           socket in order to provide enhanced  features  (see  <b><a href="../man8/qemu-ga.8.html">qemu-ga</a></b>(8)).   This  operation  also  injects  a
           firstboot script so that the Guest Agent is installed when the guest boots.

           The parameter is the same as used by the <u>--inject-virtio-win</u> operation.

           Note  that  to  do  a full conversion of a Windows guest from a foreign hypervisor like VMware (which
           involves many other operations) you should use the <b><a href="../man1/virt-v2v.1.html">virt-v2v</a></b>(1) tool instead of this.

       <b>--inject-virtio-win</b> METHOD (see "customize" below)
           Inject virtio-win drivers into a  Windows  guest.   These  drivers  add  virtio  accelerated  drivers
           suitable  when running on top of a hypervisor that supports virtio (such as qemu/KVM).  The operation
           also adjusts the Windows Registry so that the drivers are installed when the guest boots.

           The parameter can be one of:

           ISO The    path    to    the    ISO    image    containing    the     virtio-win     drivers     (eg.
               <u>/usr/share/virtio-win/virtio-win.iso</u>).

           DIR The directory containing the unpacked virtio-win drivers (eg. <u>/usr/share/virtio-win</u>).

           <b>"osinfo"</b>
               The  literal  string  "osinfo"  means  to use the libosinfo database to locate the drivers.  (See
               <b><a href="../man1/osinfo-query.1.html">osinfo-query</a></b>(1).

           Note that to do a full conversion of a Windows guest from a foreign  hypervisor  like  VMware  (which
           involves many other operations) you should use the <b><a href="../man1/virt-v2v.1.html">virt-v2v</a></b>(1) tool instead of this.

       <b>--install</b> PKG,PKG.. (see "customize" below)
           Install  the  named  packages  (a  comma-separated list).  These are installed during the image build
           using the guest’s package manager (eg. apt, yum, etc.) and the host’s network connection.

           For  an  overview  on  the  different  ways  to  install  packages,  see  "INSTALLING  PACKAGES"   in

           See also <u>--update</u>, <u>--uninstall</u>.

       <b>--keep-user-accounts</b> USERS (see "user-account" below)
           The  user  accounts  to  be  kept  in  the  guest.   The value of this option is a list of user names
           separated by comma, where specifying an user means it is going to be kept.  For example:

            --keep-user-accounts mary

           would keep the user account "mary".

           This option can be specified multiple times.

       <b>--link</b> TARGET:LINK[:LINK..] (see "customize" below)
           Create symbolic link(s) in the guest, starting at "LINK" and pointing at "TARGET".

       <b>--mkdir</b> DIR (see "customize" below)
           Create a directory in the guest.

           This uses "mkdir -p" so any intermediate directories are created, and it also works if the  directory
           already exists.

       <b>--move</b> SOURCE:DEST (see "customize" below)
           Move files or directories inside the guest.

           Wildcards cannot be used.

       <b>--no-logfile</b> (see "customize" below)
           Scrub "builder.log" (log file from build commands) from the image after building is complete.  If you
           don't want to reveal precisely how the image was built, use this option.

           See also: "LOG FILE".

       <b>--no-selinux-relabel</b> (see "customize" below)
           Do not attempt to correct the SELinux labels of files in the guest.

           In such guests that support SELinux, customization automatically relabels files so that they have the
           correct  SELinux  label.   (The  relabeling  is  performed  immediately,  but if the operation fails,
           customization will instead touch <u>/.autorelabel</u> on the image to schedule a relabel operation  for  the
           next time the image boots.)  This option disables the automatic relabeling.

           The option is a no-op for guests that do not support SELinux.

       <b>--password</b> USER:SELECTOR (see "customize" below)
           Set the password for "USER".  (Note this option does <u>not</u> create the user account).

           See  "USERS AND PASSWORDS" in <b><a href="../man1/virt-builder.1.html">virt-builder</a></b>(1) for the format of the "SELECTOR" field, and also how to
           set up user accounts.

       <b>--password-crypto</b> md5|sha256|sha512 (see "customize" below)
           When the virt tools change or set a password in the guest, this option sets the  password  encryption
           of that password to "md5", "sha256" or "sha512".

           "sha256" and "sha512" require glibc ≥ 2.7 (check <b><a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt</a></b>(3) inside the guest).

           "md5"  will  work  with  relatively  old  Linux guests (eg. RHEL 3), but is not secure against modern
           attacks.

           The default is "sha512" unless libguestfs detects an old guest that didn't have support for  SHA-512,
           in which case it will use "md5".  You can override libguestfs by specifying this option.

           Note  this does not change the default password encryption used by the guest when you create new user
           accounts inside the guest.  If you want to do that, then you should use the <u>--edit</u> option  to  modify
           "/etc/sysconfig/authconfig" (Fedora, RHEL) or "<a href="file:/etc/pam.d/common-password">/etc/pam.d/common-password</a>" (Debian, Ubuntu).

       <b>--remove-user-accounts</b> USERS (see "user-account" below)
           The  user  accounts  to  be removed from the guest.  The value of this option is a list of user names
           separated by comma, where specifying an user means it is going to be removed.  For example:

            --remove-user-accounts bob,eve

           would only remove the user accounts "bob" and "eve".

           This option can be specified multiple times.

       <b>--root-password</b> SELECTOR (see "customize" below)
           Set the root password.

           See "USERS AND PASSWORDS" in <b><a href="../man1/virt-builder.1.html">virt-builder</a></b>(1) for the format of the "SELECTOR" field, and also how  to
           set up user accounts.

           Note:  In  virt-builder,  if  you  <u>don't</u>  set  <u>--root-password</u>  then the guest is given a <u>random</u> root
           password.

       <b>--run</b> SCRIPT (see "customize" below)
           Run the shell script (or any program) called "SCRIPT" on the disk image.  The script runs virtualized
           inside a small appliance, chrooted into the guest filesystem.

           The script is automatically chmod +x.

           If libguestfs supports it then a limited network connection is available but it only allows  outgoing
           network  connections.   You can also attach data disks (eg. ISO files) as another way to provide data
           (eg. software packages) to the script without needing a network connection (<u>--attach</u>).  You can  also
           upload data files (<u>--upload</u>).

           You  can  have  multiple  <u>--run</u>  options.  They run in the same order that they appear on the command
           line.

           See also: <u>--firstboot</u>, <u>--attach</u>, <u>--upload</u>.

       <b>--run-command</b> 'CMD+ARGS' (see "customize" below)
           Run the command and arguments on the disk  image.   The  command  runs  virtualized  inside  a  small
           appliance, chrooted into the guest filesystem.

           If  libguestfs supports it then a limited network connection is available but it only allows outgoing
           network connections.  You can also attach data disks (eg. ISO files) as another way to  provide  data
           (eg.  software packages) to the script without needing a network connection (<u>--attach</u>).  You can also
           upload data files (<u>--upload</u>).

           You can have multiple <u>--run-command</u> options.  They run in the same order  that  they  appear  on  the
           command line.

           See also: <u>--firstboot</u>, <u>--attach</u>, <u>--upload</u>.

       <b>--script</b> SCRIPT (see "script" below)
           Run  the named "SCRIPT" (a shell script or program) against the guest.  The script can be any program
           on the host.  The script’s current directory will be the guest’s root directory.

           <b>Note:</b> If the script is not on the $PATH, then you must give the full absolute path to the script.

       <b>--scriptdir</b> SCRIPTDIR (see "script" below)
           The mount point (an empty directory on the host) used when the "script" operation is enabled and  one
           or more scripts are specified using <u>--script</u> parameter(s).

           <b>Note:</b> "SCRIPTDIR" <b>must</b> be an absolute path.

           If <u>--scriptdir</u> is not specified then a temporary mountpoint will be created.

       <b>--scrub</b> FILE (see "customize" below)
           Scrub a file from the guest.  This is like <u>--delete</u> except that:

           •   It scrubs the data so a guest could not recover it.

           •   It cannot delete directories, only regular files.

       <b>--selinux-relabel</b> (see "customize" below)
           This is a compatibility option that does nothing.

       <b>--sm-attach</b> SELECTOR (see "customize" below)
           Attach to a pool using "subscription-manager".

           See "SUBSCRIPTION-MANAGER" in <b><a href="../man1/virt-builder.1.html">virt-builder</a></b>(1) for the format of the "SELECTOR" field.

       <b>--sm-credentials</b> SELECTOR (see "customize" below)
           Set the credentials for "subscription-manager".

           See "SUBSCRIPTION-MANAGER" in <b><a href="../man1/virt-builder.1.html">virt-builder</a></b>(1) for the format of the "SELECTOR" field.

       <b>--sm-register</b> (see "customize" below)
           Register the guest using "subscription-manager".

           This requires credentials being set using <u>--sm-credentials</u>.

       <b>--sm-remove</b> (see "customize" below)
           Remove all the subscriptions from the guest using "subscription-manager".

       <b>--sm-unregister</b> (see "customize" below)
           Unregister the guest using "subscription-manager".

       <b>--ssh-inject</b> USER[:SELECTOR] (see "customize" below)
           Inject  an  ssh key so the given "USER" will be able to log in over ssh without supplying a password.
           The "USER" must exist already in the guest.

           See "SSH KEYS" in <b><a href="../man1/virt-builder.1.html">virt-builder</a></b>(1) for the format of the "SELECTOR" field.

           You can have multiple <u>--ssh-inject</u> options, for different users and also for more keys for each user.

       <b>--tar-in</b> TARFILE:REMOTEDIR (see "customize" below)
           Copy local files or directories from a local tar file called "TARFILE" into the disk  image,  placing
           them  in  the  directory "REMOTEDIR" (which must exist).  Note that the tar file must be uncompressed
           (<u>.tar.gz</u> files will not work here)

       <b>--timezone</b> TIMEZONE (see "customize" below)
           Set the default timezone of the guest to "TIMEZONE".  Use a location string like "Europe/London"

       <b>--touch</b> FILE (see "customize" below)
           This command performs a <b><a href="../man1/touch.1.html">touch</a></b>(1)-like operation on "FILE".

       <b>--truncate</b> FILE (see "customize" below)
           This command truncates "FILE" to a zero-length file. The file must exist already.

       <b>--truncate-recursive</b> PATH (see "customize" below)
           This command recursively truncates all files under "PATH" to zero-length.

       <b>--uninstall</b> PKG,PKG.. (see "customize" below)
           Uninstall the named packages (a comma-separated list).  These are  removed  during  the  image  build
           using  the  guest’s  package  manager  (eg.  apt, yum, etc.).  Dependent packages may also need to be
           uninstalled to satisfy the request.

           See also <u>--install</u>, <u>--update</u>.

       <b>--update</b> (see "customize" below)
           Do the equivalent of "yum update", "apt-get upgrade", or whatever command is required to  update  the
           packages already installed in the template to their latest versions.

           See also <u>--install</u>, <u>--uninstall</u>.

       <b>--upload</b> FILE:DEST (see "customize" below)
           Upload  local  file  "FILE" to destination "DEST" in the disk image.  File owner and permissions from
           the original are preserved, so you should set them to what you want them to be in the disk image.

           "DEST" could be the final filename.  This can be used to rename the file on upload.

           If "DEST" is a directory name (which must already exist in the guest) then the file is uploaded  into
           that directory, and it keeps the same name as on the local filesystem.

           See also: <u>--mkdir</u>, <u>--delete</u>, <u>--scrub</u>.

       <b>--write</b> FILE:CONTENT (see "customize" below)
           Write "CONTENT" to "FILE".

</pre><h4><b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If the <u>--enable</u>/<u>--operations</u> option is <u>not</u> given, then most sysprep operations are enabled.

       Use "virt-sysprep --list-operations" to list all operations for your virt-sysprep binary.  The ones which
       are enabled by default are marked with a "*" character.  Regardless of the <u>--enable</u>/<u>--operations</u> options,
       sysprep operations are skipped for some guest types.

       Operations  can  be  individually enabled using the <u>--enable</u>/<u>--operations</u> options.  Use a comma-separated
       list, for example:

        virt-sysprep --operations ssh-hostkeys,udev-persistent-net [etc..]

       Future versions of virt-sysprep may add  more  operations.   If  you  are  using  virt-sysprep  and  want
       predictable behaviour, specify only the operations that you want to have enabled.

       "*" = enabled by default when no <u>--enable</u>/<u>--operations</u> option is given.

   <b>abrt-data</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove the crash data generated by ABRT.

       Remove the automatically generated ABRT crash data in "/var/spool/abrt/".

   <b>backup-files</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove editor backup files from the guest.

       The following files are removed from anywhere in the guest filesystem:

       ·   *.bak

       ·   *~

       On Linux and Unix operating systems, only the following filesystems will be examined:

       ·   <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>

       ·   <a href="file:/root">/root</a>

       ·   <a href="file:/srv">/srv</a>

       ·   <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>

       ·   <a href="file:/var">/var</a>

   <b>bash-history</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove the bash history in the guest.

       Remove  the bash history of user "root" and any other users who have a ".bash_history" file in their home
       directory.

       <u>Notes</u> <u>on</u> <u>bash-history</u>

       Currently this only looks in "<a href="file:/root">/root</a>" and "<a href="file:/home/">/home/</a>*" for home directories, so users with  home  directories
       in other locations won't have the bash history removed.

   <b>blkid-tab</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove blkid tab in the guest.

   <b>ca-certificates</b>
       Remove CA certificates in the guest.

       In case any certificate is removed, the system CA store is updated.

   <b>crash-data</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove the crash data generated by kexec-tools.

       Remove the automatically generated kdump kernel crash data.

   <b>cron-spool</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove user at-jobs and cron-jobs.

   <b>customize</b> <b>*</b>
       Customize the guest.

       Customize  the guest by providing <b><a href="../man1/virt-customize.1.html">virt-customize</a></b>(1) options for installing packages, editing files and so
       on.

   <b>dhcp-client-state</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove DHCP client leases.

   <b>dhcp-server-state</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove DHCP server leases.

   <b>dovecot-data</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove Dovecot (mail server) data.

   <b>firewall-rules</b>
       Remove the firewall rules.

       This  removes  custom  firewall  rules  by  removing  "/etc/sysconfig/iptables"   or   custom   firewalld
       configuration in "/etc/firewalld/*/*".

       Note this is <u>not</u> enabled by default since it may expose guests to exploits.  Use with care.

   <b>flag-reconfiguration</b>
       Flag the system for reconfiguration.

       For  Linux  guests, this touches "/.unconfigured", which causes the first boot to interactively query the
       user for settings such as the root password and timezone.

   <b>fs-uuids</b>
       Change filesystem UUIDs.

       On guests and filesystem types where this is supported, new random UUIDs are generated  and  assigned  to
       filesystems.

       <u>Notes</u> <u>on</u> <u>fs-uuids</u>

       The  fs-uuids  operation is disabled by default because it does not yet find and update all the places in
       the guest that use the UUIDs.  For example "<a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a>" or the bootloader.  Enabling  this  operation  is
       more likely than not to make your guest unbootable.

       See: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=991641

   <b>ipa-client</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove the IPA files.

       Remove  all the files related to an IPA (Identity, Policy, Audit) system.  This effectively unenrolls the
       guest from an IPA server without interacting with it.

       This operation does not run "ipa-client".

   <b>kerberos-data</b>
       Remove Kerberos data in the guest.

   <b>kerberos-hostkeytab</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove the Kerberos host keytab file in the guest.

   <b>logfiles</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove many log files from the guest.

       On Linux the following files are removed:

       ·   /etc/Pegasus/*.cnf

       ·   /etc/Pegasus/*.crt

       ·   /etc/Pegasus/*.csr

   <b>lvm-system-devices</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove LVM2 system.devices file.

       On Linux guests, LVM2's scanning for physical volumes (PVs) may be  restricted  to  those  block  devices
       whose  WWIDs  are  listed  in  "/etc/lvm/devices/system.devices".   When  cloning  VMs, WWIDs may change,
       breaking "lvm pvscan".  Remove "/etc/lvm/devices/system.devices".

   <b>lvm-uuids</b> <b>*</b>
       Change LVM2 PV and VG UUIDs.

       On Linux guests that have LVM2 physical volumes (PVs) or  volume  groups  (VGs),  new  random  UUIDs  are
       generated and assigned to those PVs and VGs.

   <b>machine-id</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove the local machine ID.

       The  machine  ID  is usually generated from a random source during system installation and stays constant
       for all subsequent boots.  Optionally, for stateless systems it is generated during runtime at boot if it
       is found to be empty.

   <b>mail-spool</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove email from the local mail spool directory.

   <b>net-hostname</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove HOSTNAME and DHCP_HOSTNAME in network interface configuration.

       For Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, this is removed from "ifcfg-*" files.

   <b>net-hwaddr</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove HWADDR (hard-coded MAC address) configuration.

       For Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, this is removed from "ifcfg-*" files.

   <b>net-nmconn</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove system-local NetworkManager connection profiles (keyfiles).

       On       Fedora        and        Red        Hat        Enterprise        Linux,        remove        the
       "/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/*.nmconnection" files.

   <b>pacct-log</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove the process accounting log files.

       The system wide process accounting will store to the pacct log files if the process accounting is on.

   <b>package-manager-cache</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove package manager cache.

   <b>pam-data</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove the PAM data in the guest.

   <b>passwd-backups</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove <a href="file:/etc/passwd-">/etc/passwd-</a> and similar backup files.

       On Linux the following files are removed:

       ·   <a href="file:/etc/group-">/etc/group-</a>

       ·   <a href="file:/etc/gshadow-">/etc/gshadow-</a>

       ·   <a href="file:/etc/passwd-">/etc/passwd-</a>

       ·   <a href="file:/etc/subgid-">/etc/subgid-</a>

       ·   <a href="file:/etc/subuid-">/etc/subuid-</a>

   <b>puppet-data-log</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove the data and log files of puppet.

   <b>rh-subscription-manager</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove the RH subscription manager files.

   <b>rhn-systemid</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove the RHN system ID.

   <b>rpm-db</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove host-specific RPM database files.

       Remove  host-specific  RPM  database  files  and  locks.   RPM will recreate these files automatically if
       needed.

   <b>samba-db-log</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove the database and log files of Samba.

   <b>script</b> <b>*</b>
       Run arbitrary scripts against the guest.

       The "script" module lets you run arbitrary shell scripts or programs against the guest.

       Note this feature requires FUSE support.  You may have to enable this in your host, for example by adding
       the current user to the "fuse" group, or by loading a kernel module.

       Use one or more <u>--script</u> parameters to specify scripts or programs that will be run against the guest.

       The script or program is run with its current directory being the guest’s  root  directory,  so  relative
       paths  should  be used.  For example: "rm etc/resolv.conf" in the script would remove a Linux guest’s DNS
       configuration file, but "rm <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a>" would (try to) remove the host’s file.

       Normally a temporary mount point for the guest is used, but you can choose a specific one  by  using  the
       <u>--scriptdir</u> parameter.

       <b>Note:</b>  This  is  different  from  <u>--firstboot</u>  scripts  (which run in the context of the guest when it is
       booting first time).  <u>--script</u> scripts run on the host, not in the guest.

   <b>smolt-uuid</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove the Smolt hardware UUID.

   <b>ssh-hostkeys</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove the SSH host keys in the guest.

       The SSH host keys are regenerated (differently) next time the guest is booted.

       If, after cloning, the guest gets the same IP address, ssh will give you a stark warning about  the  host
       key changing:

        @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
        @    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
        @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
        IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!

   <b>ssh-userdir</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove ".ssh" directories in the guest.

       Remove  the ".ssh" directory of user "root" and any other users who have a ".ssh" directory in their home
       directory.

       <u>Notes</u> <u>on</u> <u>ssh-userdir</u>

       Currently this only looks in "<a href="file:/root">/root</a>" and "<a href="file:/home/">/home/</a>*" for home directories, so users with  home  directories
       in other locations won't have the ssh files removed.

   <b>sssd-db-log</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove the database and log files of sssd.

   <b>tmp-files</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove temporary files.

       This removes temporary files under "<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>" and "<a href="file:/var/tmp">/var/tmp</a>".

   <b>udev-persistent-net</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove udev persistent net rules.

       Remove  udev  persistent  net rules which map the guest’s existing MAC address to a fixed ethernet device
       (eg. eth0).

       After a guest is cloned, the MAC address usually changes.  Since the old MAC  address  occupies  the  old
       name  (eg.  eth0),  this  means  the  fresh  MAC address is assigned to a new name (eg. eth1) and this is
       usually undesirable.  Erasing the udev persistent net rules avoids this.

   <b>user-account</b>
       Remove the user accounts in the guest.

       By default remove all the user accounts and their home directories.  The "root" account is not removed.

       See the <u>--remove-user-accounts</u> parameter for a way to specify how to remove only some users,  or  to  not
       remove some others.

   <b>utmp</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove the utmp file.

       This  file  records  who  is currently logged in on a machine.  In modern Linux distros it is stored in a
       ramdisk and hence not part of the virtual machine’s disk, but it was stored on disk in older distros.

   <b>yum-uuid</b> <b>*</b>
       Remove the yum UUID.

       Yum creates a fresh UUID the next time it runs when it notices that the original UUID has been erased.

</pre><h4><b>COPYING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CLONING</b></h4><pre>
       Virt-sysprep can be used as part of a process of cloning guests, or to  prepare  a  template  from  which
       guests  can  be  cloned.   There  are  many different ways to achieve this using the virt tools, and this
       section is just an introduction.

       A virtual machine (when switched off) consists of two parts:

       <u>configuration</u>
           The configuration or description of the guest.  eg.  The  libvirt  XML  (see  "virsh  dumpxml"),  the
           running configuration of the guest, or another external format like OVF.

           Some configuration items that might need to be changed:

           •   name

           •   UUID

           •   path to block device(s)

           •   network card MAC address

       <u>block</u> <u>device(s)</u>
           One  or  more  hard  disk  images,  themselves  containing files, directories, applications, kernels,
           configuration, etc.

           Some things inside the block devices that might need to be changed:

           •   hostname and other net configuration

           •   UUID

           •   SSH host keys

           •   Windows unique security ID (SID)

           •   Puppet registration

   <b>COPYING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>BLOCK</b> <b>DEVICE</b>
       Starting with an original guest, you probably wish to copy the guest block device and  its  configuration
       to  make  a  template.  Then once you are happy with the template, you will want to make many clones from
       it.

                               virt-sysprep
                                    |
                                    v
        original guest --------&gt; template ----------&gt;
                                             \------&gt; cloned
                                              \-----&gt; guests
                                               \----&gt;

       You can, of course, just copy the block device on the host using <b><a href="../man1/cp.1.html">cp</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd</a></b>(1).

                          dd                 dd
        original guest --------&gt; template ----------&gt;
                                             \------&gt; cloned
                                              \-----&gt; guests
                                               \----&gt;

       There are some smarter (and faster) ways too:

                                 snapshot
                       template ----------&gt;
                                   \------&gt; cloned
                                    \-----&gt; guests
                                     \----&gt;

       You may want to run virt-sysprep twice, once to reset the guest (to make a template) and a second time to
       customize the guest for a specific user:

                           virt-sysprep        virt-sysprep
                             (reset)      (add user, keys, logos)
                                |                   |
                        dd      v          dd       v
        original guest ----&gt; template ---------&gt; copied ------&gt; custom
                                                 template       guest

       •   Create a snapshot using qemu-img:

            qemu-img create -f qcow2 -o backing_file=original snapshot.qcow

           The advantage is that you don’t need to copy the original (very fast) and  only  changes  are  stored
           (less storage required).

           Note  that writing to the backing file once you have created guests on top of it is not possible: you
           will corrupt the guests.

       •   Create a snapshot using "lvcreate --snapshot".

       •   Other ways to create snapshots include using filesystems-level tools (for filesystems such as btrfs).

           Most Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices can also create cheap snapshots from files or LUNs.

       •   Get your NAS to duplicate the LUN.  Most NAS devices can also duplicate LUNs very cheaply (they  copy
           them on-demand in the background).

       •   Prepare your template using <b><a href="../man1/virt-sparsify.1.html">virt-sparsify</a></b>(1).  See below.

   <b>VIRT-CLONE</b>
       A  separate  tool,  <b><a href="../man1/virt-clone.1.html">virt-clone</a></b>(1),  can  be used to duplicate the block device and/or modify the external
       libvirt configuration of a guest.  It will reset the name, UUID and MAC  address  of  the  guest  in  the
       libvirt XML.

       <b><a href="../man1/virt-clone.1.html">virt-clone</a></b>(1)  does  not  use  libguestfs  and  cannot look inside the disk image.  This was the original
       motivation to write virt-sysprep.

   <b>SPARSIFY</b>
                     virt-sparsify
        original guest --------&gt; template

       <b><a href="../man1/virt-sparsify.1.html">virt-sparsify</a></b>(1) can be used to make the cloning template smaller, making it easier  to  compress  and/or
       faster to copy.

       Notice  that  since virt-sparsify also copies the image, you can use it to make the initial copy (instead
       of "dd").

   <b>RESIZE</b>
                                virt-resize
                       template ----------&gt;
                                   \------&gt; cloned
                                    \-----&gt; guests
                                     \----&gt;

       If you want to give people cloned guests, but let them  pick  the  size  of  the  guest  themselves  (eg.
       depending on how much they are prepared to pay for disk space), then instead of copying the template, you
       can  run  <b><a href="../man1/virt-resize.1.html">virt-resize</a></b>(1).   Virt-resize  performs a copy and resize, and thus is ideal for cloning guests
       from a template.

</pre><h4><b>FIRSTBOOT</b> <b>VS</b> <b>SCRIPT</b></h4><pre>
       The two options <u>--firstboot</u> and <u>--script</u> both supply shell  scripts  that  are  run  against  the  guest.
       However these two options are significantly different.

       <u>--firstboot</u>  <u>script</u> uploads the file "script" into the guest and arranges that it will run, in the guest,
       when the guest is next booted.  (The script will only run once, at the "first boot").

       <u>--script</u> <u>script</u> runs the shell "script" <u>on</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>host</u>,  with  its  current  directory  inside  the  guest
       filesystem.

       If you needed, for example, to "yum install" new packages, then you <u>must</u> <u>not</u> use <u>--script</u> for this, since
       that  would  (a)  run  the  "yum"  command on the host and (b) wouldn't have access to the same resources
       (repositories, keys, etc.) as the guest.  Any command that needs to run on the  guest  <u>must</u>  be  run  via
       <u>--firstboot</u>.

       On  the  other  hand if you need to make adjustments to the guest filesystem (eg. copying in files), then
       <u>--script</u> is ideal since (a) it has access to the host filesystem and (b) you will get immediate  feedback
       on errors.

       Either or both options can be used multiple times on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       Virtual  machines  that  employ full disk encryption <u>internally</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>guest</u> should not be considered for
       cloning and distribution, as it provides multiple parties with the same internal volume key, enabling any
       one such party to decrypt all the other clones.  Refer to the LUKS FAQ for details.

       Although virt-sysprep removes some sensitive information from the guest, it does not  pretend  to  remove
       all of it.  You should examine the "OPERATIONS" above and the guest afterwards.

       Sensitive  files  are  simply  removed.   The  data  they  contained  may still exist on the disk, easily
       recovered with a hex editor or undelete tool.  The <u>--scrub</u> option can be used to scrub files  instead  of
       just  deleting  them.   <b><a href="../man1/virt-sparsify.1.html">virt-sparsify</a></b>(1)  is  another  way to remove this content.  See also the <b><a href="../man1/scrub.1.html">scrub</a></b>(1)
       command to get rid of deleted content in directory entries and inodes.

   <b>RANDOM</b> <b>SEED</b>
       <u>(This</u> <u>section</u> <u>applies</u> <u>to</u> <u>Linux</u> <u>guests</u> <u>only)</u>

       For supported guests, virt-sysprep writes a few bytes of randomness from the host into the guest’s random
       seed file.

       If this is just done once and the guest is cloned from the same template, then each guest will start with
       the same entropy, and things like SSH host keys and TCP sequence numbers may be predictable.

       Therefore you should arrange to add more randomness <u>after</u> cloning from a template too, which can be  done
       by enabling just the customize module:

        cp template.img newguest.img
        virt-sysprep --enable customize -a newguest.img

</pre><h4><b>SELINUX</b></h4><pre>
       For  guests  which  make  use of SELinux, special handling for them might be needed when using operations
       which create new files or alter existing ones.

       For further details, see "SELINUX" in <b><a href="../man1/virt-builder.1.html">virt-builder</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>WINDOWS</b> <b>8</b></h4><pre>
       Windows 8 "fast startup" can prevent virt-sysprep from working.  See "WINDOWS HIBERNATION AND  WINDOWS  8
       FAST STARTUP" in <b><a href="../man3/guestfs.3.html">guestfs</a></b>(3).

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       This program returns 0 on success, or 1 if there was an error.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       "VIRT_TOOLS_DATA_DIR"
           This can point to the directory containing data files used for Windows firstboot installation.

           Normally you do not need to set this.  If not set, a compiled-in default will be used (something like
           <u>/usr/share/virt-tools</u>).

           This directory may contain the following files:

           <u>rhsrvany.exe</u>
               This  is the RHSrvAny Windows binary, used to install a "firstboot" script in Windows guests.  It
               is required if you intend to use the <u>--firstboot</u>  or  <u>--firstboot-command</u>  options  with  Windows
               guests.

               See also: "https://github.com/rwmjones/rhsrvany"

           <u>pvvxsvc.exe</u>
               This  is a Windows binary shipped with SUSE VMDP, used to install a "firstboot" script in Windows
               guests.  It is required if you intend to use the <u>--firstboot</u> or <u>--firstboot-command</u> options  with
               Windows guests.
