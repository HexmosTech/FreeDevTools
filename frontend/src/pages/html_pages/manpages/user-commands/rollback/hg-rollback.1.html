       hg rollback - roll back the last transaction (DANGEROUS) (DEPRECATED)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       hg rollback

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Please use <b>hg</b> <b>commit</b> <b>--amend</b> instead of rollback to correct mistakes in the last commit.

       This command should be used with care. There is only one level of rollback, and there is no way to undo a
       rollback.  It  will  also  restore  the dirstate at the time of the last transaction, losing any dirstate
       changes since that time. This command does not alter the working directory.

       Transactions are used to encapsulate the effects of all commands that create new changesets or  propagate
       existing changesets into a repository.

       For example, the following commands are transactional, and their effects can be rolled back:

       • commit

       • import

       • pull

       • push (with this repository as the destination)

       • unbundle

         To avoid permanent data loss, rollback will refuse to rollback a commit transaction if it isn't checked
         out. Use --force to override this protection.

         The  rollback  command  can  be  entirely  disabled by setting the <b>ui.rollback</b> configuration setting to
         false. If you're here because you want to use rollback and it's disabled, you can re-enable the command
         by setting <b>ui.rollback</b> to true.

         This command is not intended for use on public repositories. Once changes are visible for pull by other
         users, rolling a transaction back locally is ineffective (someone else  may  already  have  pulled  the
         changes).  Furthermore,  a  race is possible with readers of the repository; for example an in-progress
         pull from the repository may fail if a rollback is performed.

         Returns 0 on success, 1 if no rollback data is available.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-n,</b> <b>--dry-run</b>
              do not perform actions, just print output

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--force</b>
              ignore safety measures

                                                                                                    <u>HG</u>(ROLLBACK)
