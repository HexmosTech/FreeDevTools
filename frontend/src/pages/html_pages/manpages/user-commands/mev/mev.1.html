</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mev - a program to report mouse events

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mev</b> [ <u>options</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  `mev' program is part of the gpm package.  The information below is extracted from the texinfo file,
       which is the preferred source of information.

       The `mev' program is modeled after `xev'. It prints to `stdout' the mouse console events it gets.

       `mev''s default behaviour is to get anything, but command line switches can be used to  set  the  various
       fields  in the `Gpm_Connect' structure, in order to customize the program's behaviour. I'm using `mev' to
       handle mouse events to Emacs.

       Command line switches for `mev' are the following:

       -C <u>number</u>
              Select a virtual console to get events from.  This is intended to be used for debugging.

       -d <u>number</u>
              Choose a default mask. By default the server gets any events not belonging to the event mask.  The
              mask can be provided either as a decimal number, or as a symbolic string.

       -e <u>number</u>
              Choose  the  event  mask.  By  default any event is received. The mask can be provided either as a
              decimal number, or as a symbolic string.

       -E     Enter emacs mode. In emacs mode events are reported as lisp forms rather than numbers. This is the
              format used by the t-mouse package within emacs.

       -f     Fit events inside the screen before reporting them. This options re-fits drag  events,  which  are
              allowed to exit the screen border,

       -i     Interactive. Accepts input from `stdin' to change connection parameters.

       -m <u>number</u>
              Choose the minimum modifier mask. Any event with fewer modifiers will not be reported to `mev'. It
              defaults to `0'.  The mask must be provided either as a decimal number, or as a symbolic string.

       -M <u>number</u>
              Choose the maximum modifier mask. Any event with more modifier than specified will not be reported
              to  `mev'.   It defaults to ` ~0', i.e. all events are received.  The mask must be provided either
              as a decimal number, or as a symbolic string.

       -p     Requests to draw the pointer during drags.  This  option  is  used  by  emacs  to  avoid  invoking
              `ioctl()' from lisp code.

       When  the  arguments  are  not  decimal  integers,  they are considered lists of alphanumeric characters,
       separated by a single non-alphanumeric character. I use the comma (`,'), but any will do.

       Allowed names for events are `move', `drag', `down' or `press', `up' or  `release',  `motion'  (which  is
       both `move' and `drag'), and `hard'.

       Allowed names for modifiers are `shift', `leftAlt', `rightAlt', `anyAlt' (one or the other), `control'.

       When the `-i' switch is specified, `mev' looks at its standard input as command lines rather than events.
       The input lines are parsed, and the commands `push' and `pop' are recognized.

       The  `push' command, then, accepts the options `-d', `-e', `-m' and `-M', with the same meaning described
       above. Unspecified options retain the previous value and the resulting  masks  are  used  to  reopen  the
       connection  with  the  server. `pop' is used to pop the connection stack. If an empty stack is popped the
       program exits.

       Other commands recognized are `info', used to return the stack depth; `quit' to prematurely terminate the
       program; and `snapshot' to get some configuration information from the server.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Beginning with release 1.16, <b>mev</b> no longer works under xterm.  Please use the <b>rmev</b> program  (provided  in
       the  <b>sample</b>  directory)  to  watch  gpm  events  under xterm or rxvt.  <b>rmev</b> also displays keyboard events
       besides mouse events.
