</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Disc-Cover creates front and back covers for audio CDs. The CD has to be present in the CD-ROM drive, or
       alternatively a valid CDDB file can be used.  Disc-Cover searches the CDDB database for an entry
       corresponding to the CD's CDDB ID. It starts by looking for a local CDDB entry in <u><a href="file:~/.cddb">~/.cddb</a></u> (or another
       directory pointed to by your cddb installation). If no local CDDB entry matches the CD, disc-cover
       continues to search the online CDDB databases or CDINDEX databases as configured in the AudioCD library.
       It then formats the entry to produce a Latex, Dvi, Postscript or PDF file, which contains the front and
       back covers on a single page. Other formats supported include a simple text output, a CDDB compatible
       format, HTML and an output format that can be used with cdlabelgen
       (<a href="http://www.red-bean.com/~bwf/software/cdlabelgen/">http://www.red-bean.com/~bwf/software/cdlabelgen/</a>), another cover builder.

</pre><h4><b>QUICKSTART</b></h4><pre>
       The easiest way of using Disc-Cover is to put an audio cd in your cdrom drive and then run disc-cover
       without options. Disc-Cover will tell you what it does and if it is able to create a set of covers it
       tells you the name of the file it creates. Normally this is a PostScript file that is ready for printing.

</pre><h4><b>LAYOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The front cover shows artist, album title and when available extended disc info. Optionally a picture can
       be added to the front cover. The back cover holds the title and artist in the same fashion. In addition
       to those, the back cover lists the individual tracks, preceded by a track number and followed by their
       running time. The total running time of the CD is given at the bottom of the back cover. The sides of the
       back cover contain the artist and CD title.  Another flap hangs on the side of the right of the back
       cover. When using fully transparent jewel cases this flap is visible from the front. By default it holds
       the user's full name. Colour is also supported.

</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       - Uses Latex to produce high quality output.
       - Outputs in Latex, Dvi, Postscript, Pdf, Cddb entry, HTML, Text and a format to use with cdlabelgen.
       - Supports caching of cddb entries in a directory that can be shared with other cddb-aware programs.
       - Connects with a cddb or cdindex server to get the disc title, artist and list of track titles and
       extended information where available.
       - Optionally put a picture on the front cover, supports almost any image format.
       - Optionally let Disc-Cover search on allmusic.com for a small version of the corresponding front cover
       of the cd, which it will put on your front cover.
       - Assign different colours to different items such as artist name and track numbers.
       - Supports double albums (two cds in one jewel case).
       - Creates covers for jewel cases and various slim cases.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-2,</b> <b>-second</b> <u>filename</u>
           When  using this option disc-cover goes into double album mode, meaning it will print the front cover
           using the first cddb entry, either reading the cd in the drive or by using a  file  as  described  in
           "<b>-f,</b>  <b>-file</b>  <u>filename</u>" option. Then it prints the back cover with two halves, the upper half consists
           the title/artist and then the tracks of the first cd, the lower  half  contains  the  tracks  of  the
           second cd.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>-additional</b> <u>text</u>
           Add  text to the bottom of the front cover. Default is to put extended disc information here. You can
           use this to cancel the extended disc information by doing '<b>-a</b> " "'.

       <b>-allmusic</b>
           Search on wwww.allmusic.com for the front cover of the album. This picture will be put on  the  front
           cover,  just  like  with  <b>-p</b> and <b>-pic</b>. These last options override this flag. This way you can enable
           -allmusic by default in the config file and override it whenever you need to.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>-flaptext</b> <u>text</u>
           Add text to the additional flap at the side of the back cover. This flap is visible when used with  a
           fully  transparent  jewel  case.  These  are  becoming more common everyday. By default text from the
           password entry is used. We take the string from the comments field up until  the  first  comma.  Most
           times  this  should be the user's full name. Cancel this text by using the configuration file or with
           '<b>-b</b> " "'.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>-casetype</b> (<u>jewel|slim|x-slim|tevion-slim|letter-slim</u>)
           These options correspond with files in one of the  @config_template_dirs  which  are  templates  that
           describe  case  types.  You can also copy one of these files to your current directory, change it and
           let disc-cover use your own template.  The cases described next are  delivered  together  with  Disc-
           Cover.   Setting this to slim will have Disc-Cover output covers in a format suitable for slim cases.
           These are thinner cases often used for single cds or EPs. Use x-slim if you want the  side  and  flap
           exchanged.  Even  more  slim  are  the  cases provided by Tevion (use: tevion-slim). For people using
           letter format that have trouble with not getting the whole case fitted on paper, please  use  letter-
           slim.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>-Configuration</b> <u>filename</u>
           Output  configuration to a file. The current flags and options set in existing configuration files or
           given on the commandline are used to set the values.  To see the current settings do  ;disc-cover  -C
           -'.  For example, you can change the default output format to pdf as follows:

             disc-cover -t pdf -C <a href="file:~/.disc-coverrc">~/.disc-coverrc</a>

       <b>-D,</b> <b>-Device</b> <u>device</u>
           Specify the CD-ROM device. Default is to use <u>/dev/cdrom</u>

       <b>-e,</b> <b>-extended</b>
           This flag enables extended track information, when available. This extended information will be added
           below  the  track  names. It is mostly used in compilation cds for artist information. Sometimes this
           extended track information has been used for lyrics, needles to say this will not fit at the back  of
           one  cd  cover  and  hence to prevent the destruction of the layout only the first line will be used.
           That is why this is an option instead of default behaviour.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>-file</b> <u>filename</u>
           Use filename as input instead of searching the local and online CDDB database. File should be a valid
           CDDB entry.

       <b>-g,</b> <b>-genre</b>
           Include the genre of the disc as the last line of the bottom text on the front cover.  The line looks
           like this: "genre: <u>genre</u>". Default is off, as often the wrong genre is used or even just misc or data
           has been chosen.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>-help</b>
           Print help message and exit.

       <b>-H,</b> <b>-Help</b>
           Show the manual page using pod2text, this should be installed and working  (you  can  check  this  by
           typing 'pod2text /path/to/disc-cover')

       <b>-n,</b> <b>-new</b>
           Creates  a  new  cddb  entry.  This works with any format, but should be used in conjunction with '-t
           cddb' to create a template for you to fill in. See the "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS" to create  covers
           for your custom cds or for cds that are not in the CDDB database yet.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>-output</b> <u>filename</u>
           The  -o  switch  allows  one  to specify the name of the output file. By default the filename will be
           Artist_Title.xxx, where xxx is txt, tex, dvi, ps, pdf or html, depending on the file format.  See  -t
           option for supported file formats. Using "<b>-o</b> -" will send the output to standard output.

       <b>-p</b> <u>filename</u>
           Includes  the picture <u>filename</u> on the front cover in a framed box right aligned with the artist name.
           The format of the picture has to be known to the program <u>convert</u> that comes  with  <u>ImageMagick</u>.  Also
           the  graphicx  package  for LaTeX has to be available. The picture is scaled to 200x200 and converted
           into Adobe Encapsulated PostScript Interchange format. Remember that output in tex,  dvi,  txt,  html
           and  labelgen  are  completely  useless  with  pictures.  In  case  of  output  in pdf the picture is
           transformed into Encapsulated Portable Document Format (EPDF).

       <b>-pic</b> <u>filename</u>
           Include a graphics file on the front cover without converting it. This only works when the format  of
           the file is the same as the output format. In case of PostScript (PS) output you can use Encapsulated
           PostScript  (EPS,EPSI)  files.  In  case  of  Portable Document Format (PDF) you can use Encapsulated
           Portable Document Format (EPDF). Note that this is essentially the same option as  in  "<b>-p</b>  <u>filename</u>"
           but no scaling or converting is performed. More responsibility goes to the user this way.

       <b>-R,</b> <b>-Remove</b>
           By  default disc-cover deletes all temporary files it creates before it exits.  This behaviour can be
           overwritten by specifying the this option. For debugging purposes only.

       <b>-S,</b> <b>-Server</b>
           Create a default configuration for the selection of CDDB server. This configuration is used by  other
           CDDB  aware  programs  too,  so be careful. Note that Disc-Cover will not overwrite the configuration
           file.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>-type</b> <u>txt|tex|dvi|ps|pdf|cddb|lbl|html</u>
           The -t switch allows one to specify the output format. By default disc-cover will create a Postscript
           file. Other formats supported include ASCII text (txt), LaTeX  (tex),  DVI  (dvi),  PDF  (pdf),  cddb
           database format (cddb), a cdlabelgen compatible format (lbl) and in Hypertext Markup Language (html).

       <b>-u,</b> <b>-uppercase</b>
           Fixes  those  annoying entries that are written without capitals. It capitalises every single word in
           titles and artists.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>-version</b>
           Print version and program information and exit.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>-Verbose</b>
           Enable verbose output of Disc-Cover, the libaudiocd library and all third  party  software,  such  as
           LaTeX, dvips and convert. For debugging purposes.

       <b>-va,</b> <b>-variousartists</b>
           Some  CDDB  entries code every track in the 'artist / title' format. Mostly, this is used for artists
           that contain  various  artists.  By  enabling  this  option  Disc-Cover  will  decode  and  use  that
           information.

       <b>-template_list</b>
           Prints a list of output template types and their descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Disc-cover  first  checks  the  file  <u>/etc/disc-cover.conf</u>  for  system wide parameters and then looks at
       <u><a href="file:~/.disc-coverrc">~/.disc-coverrc</a></u>. Following are all the different variables that can be set.  The  file  <u><a href="file:~/.cdserverrc">~/.cdserverrc</a></u>  is
       used indirectly through the AudioCD library. This file contains the CDDB and CDINDEX servers. Furthermore
       it can be used to control certain other options of this library. See the appropriate documentation.

       You  can  generate  a configuration file with the "<b>-C,</b> <b>-Configuration</b> <u>filename</u>" option. Keep in mind that
       the values in this file will  be  set  by  looking  at  the  current  settings.  That  is,  any  existing
       configuration files or options on the commandline will be used.

       To make a clean configuration file, first remove the <a href="file:~/.disc-coverrc">~/.disc-coverrc</a> file and then run Disc-Cover without
       any option but '-C': disc-cover -C <a href="file:~/.disc-coverrc">~/.disc-coverrc</a>

       $config_version_config
           This  will  be  used  in  the  future  by  new versions of Disc-Cover to check for inconsistencies in
           changed, removed or added configuration options.

            Default: '1.4.0';

       $config_tmp_dir
           This sets the directory that is used for temporary files.

            Default: '<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>';

       $config_output_format
           This is the default output format. Although you can choose any of the types listed in 'disc-cover -h'
           option the most common would be 'ps' or 'pdf'.

            Default: 'ps';

       $config_device
           The default cdrom drive that is used to scan a cd. See "<b>-D,</b> <b>-Device</b> <u>device</u>"

            Default: '/dev/cdrom';

       $config_cddb_cache_directory
           The path where cddb entries are stored in and retrieved from. This can be shared with other  programs
           that also use cddb.

            Default: "$ENV{HOME}/.cddb";

       $flag_with_extended_track_info
           Setting  this to one will force disc-cover to include extended track information. See "<b>-e,</b> <b>-extended</b>"
           option. It is advised to keep this 0 as there are lots of entries that contain ugly  and  meaningless
           extended information. Most of the time it is only useful in case of various artists cds.

            Default: 0;

       $flag_various_artist_cd
           Setting  this  to one will force disc-cover to parse every track the same way it parses the 'artist /
           title' label. This might be useful for various artist cds where every track is formatted in the  same
           way.  It is advised to leave this option 0, as disc-cover will issue a warning whenever it encounters
           such a disc.  You can easily turn it on with "<b>-va,</b> <b>-variousartists</b>"

            Default: 0;

       $flag_double_disc_cdtitle
           Setting this flag during the processing of a double cd (using the "<b>-2,</b>  <b>-second</b>"  option)  enables  a
           'smart'  algorithm  that  attempts  to  find  a  nice title for the cd, using the titles of both cddb
           entries. It will remove all characters unequal in both  strings,  and  gets  rid  of  any  characters
           surrounding  uncommon parts. Last, it removes the words 'disc' and 'disk', plus any whitespace at the
           beginning or end., -second&gt;&gt; option) enables a 'smart' algorithm that attempts to find a  nice  title
           for  the  cd,  using  the  titles of both cddb entries. It will remove all characters unequal in both
           strings, and gets rid of any characters surrounding uncommon parts. Last, it removes the words 'disc'
           and 'disk', plus any whitespace at the beginning or end.

            Default: 1;

       $flag_genre
           By setting this an additional line will be added to the bottom of the bottom text on the front  cover
           with the genre (taken from the database) of the disc. See <b>-g,</b> <b>-genre</b> option.

            Default: 0;

       $flag_picture_use_allmusic
           Setting  this flag does the same as the <b>-allmusic</b> option. That is, Disc-Cover will search for a cover
           picture on allmusic to be put on the front cover.

            Default: 0;

       $flag_uppercase_fix
           Setting this flag does the same as the <b>-u,-uppercase</b> option.  That  is,  Disc-Cover  will  capitalise
           every single word in titles and artists.

            Default: 0;

       %config_latex_colors
           This  is  a  list  of colours that can be set to alter most of the different items that appear on the
           covers. You can change the colour of the title, artist, discinfo, track strings,  track  numbers  and
           track times independently. Use colours from the color.sty Latex file: black, white, red, green, blue,
           cyan, magenta and yellow.

            Default: ( title =&gt; 'black',
                       artist =&gt; 'black',
                       discinfo =&gt; 'black',
                       track_number =&gt; 'black',
                       track_string =&gt; 'black',
                       track_time =&gt; 'black',
                       track_extended =&gt; 'black'
                       track_artist =&gt; 'black'
                       flaptext =&gt; 'black',
                     );

       $config_flaptext
           This  takes  the string from the comments field of the user's password entry. We use only the text up
           until the first comma, which normally is set to the user's full name.  You  can  also  put  a  simple
           string here or an empty one to cancel the output. See also "<b>-b,</b> <b>-flaptext</b> <u>text</u>" option.

            Default: split ',', (getpwuid($&lt;)))[6];

       $config_casetype
           This  determines  for  which type of case output is generated. It searches for a template file in all
           the @config_template_dirs with the same name.

            Default: "jewel";

       $latex_user_packages
           If you create a template that requires special LaTeX packages, they can be added here. Generally  not
           advised if you want to share your templates with others as they need to own those LaTeX packages, and
           add them to Disc-Cover's configuration file.

            Default: "";

       $latex_language_encoding
           Whenever you create cds with languages not normally supported by LaTeX you should add or change this.
           It calls \usepackage[$latex_language_encoding]{inputenc}. Main encodings are, latin1 for ISO Latin-1,
           ascii for pure ASCII, ansinew and cp1252 (they are synonyms) for Windows 3.1 ANSI (an MS extension of
           ISO Latin-1) and applemac for Apple MacIntosh.

            Default: "latin1";

       A: You have no CDDB servers  configured.  Either  use  the  wonderful  program  cdcd  to  create  such  a
       configuration or run disc-cover with the options -S.

   <b>Q:</b> <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>cover</b> <b>for</b> <b>homemade</b> <b>cds?</b>
       A: Follow these steps.

       1. Insert the homemade cd.

       2. Run disc-cover like this:
           disc-cover -n -t cddb -o myfile.cddb

       3. Edit the myfile.cddb with some text editor, the tracks will all be named
          "Untitled". This should be very easy.

       4. For printable output run disc-cover again:

       A:  You have to install lbcdaudio first. Your distribution does not contain it, or it does not install it
       with the standard setup.

   <b>Q:</b> <b>After</b> <b>installation</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>CD's</b> <b>are</b> <b>reread</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet.</b>
       A: Run the following commands (from a script, if you like)

         cd <a href="file:~/.cddb">~/.cddb</a>
         ln -s . blues
         ln -s . classical
         ln -s . country
         ln -s . data
         ln -s . folk
         ln -s . jazz
         ln -s . newage
         ln -s . reggae
         ln -s . rock
         ln -s . soundtrack
         ln -s . misc

   <b>Q:</b> <b>Q3.</b> <b>Mike</b> <b>Oliphant's</b> <b>grip</b> <b>creates</b> <b>cddb-files</b> <b>with</b> <b>track-artist</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b>  <b>special</b>  <b>field</b>  <b>called</b>  <b>TARTIST0,</b>
       <b>TARTIST1,</b> <b>...</b>  <b>Why</b> <b>can't</b> <b>disc-cover</b> <b>print</b> <b>these</b> <b>labels</b> <b>appropriately</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>"-va"</b> <b>option?</b>
       A:  Unfortunately Mike's idea to invent new tags for the track artist violates the freedb-conventions for
       handling samplers. There will be no support for this.

   <b>Q:</b> <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> <b>covers?</b>
       A: This is my routine for jewel cases, just one way of doing it. I start with the front cover.  I cut  it
       with  two cuts along the width of the paper. This results in a front cover with two pieces of paper along
       the sides. These are folded backwards to help the cover keep in place when it is inserted  in  the  jewel
       case. The back cover is just cut with four cuts.

   <b>Q:</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>print</b> <b>my</b> <b>cover</b> <b>from</b> <b>PDF</b> <b>in</b> <b>Acrobat</b> <b>Reader</b> <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>covers</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>small.</b> <b>How</b> <b>come?</b>
       A: Hendrik Neumann &lt;<a href="mailto:h-n@gmx.net">h-n@gmx.net</a>&gt;: The problem is the option 'Fit to page' that makes Acrobat Reader scale
       the page before printing. Turn it off before attempting to print.

   <b>Q:</b> <b>I'm</b> <b>not</b> <b>root</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>Audio::CD</b>
       A: Adam Spiers &lt;<a href="mailto:adam@spiers.net">adam@spiers.net</a>&gt;: make sure that the correct parameters are given to the perl Makefile.PL
       file as follows:

         perl Makefile.PL LIBS="-L/nfs-home/adams/local/lib -lcdaudio" \
         INC=-I/nfs-home/adams/software/libcdaudio-0.99.6/source PREFIX=~

   <b>Q:</b> <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>covers</b> <b>for</b> <b>double</b> <b>cds?</b>
       A: Follow these steps:

       1. insert the <u>second</u> disc

       2. Run disc-cover:
           disc-cover -t cddb -o disc2.cddb

       3. replace the second disc with the first

       4. Run disc-cover again:
           disc-cover -2 disc2.cddb

   <b>Q:</b> <b>The</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> <b>reduced!</b>
       A: The image is resized to 200x200 pixels, this is to make sure that the size of the resulting eps or pdf
       picture  is not too large. You can work around this by converting your picture yourself, for example with
       jpeg2ps, and then including this in your cover using the '-pic' option. This options  includes  files  as
       they are.

   <b>Q:</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>Disc-Cover</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> <b>specific</b> <b>feature,</b> <b>what</b> <b>now?</b>
       A:  Send  me  an  e-mail with your feature or better yet, implement it yourself and send me a patch file.
       This does not guarantee that your feature will be in any future version though.  I  would  like  to  keep
       Disc-Cover  as  simple  to use as possible. But, sometimes I can't resist to put in something new, or the
       number of e-mails on one feature grows large enough for me to add it to Disc-Cover.

   <b>Q:</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>Disc-Cover</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> <b>correct</b> <b>cover,</b> <b>what's</b> <b>wrong?</b>
       A: I don't know! If you e-mail the problem I can try to fix it. When you mail some error please  remember
       to  state  the  problem  as  exact  as you can and to include the cddb entry (save it with 'disc-cover -t
       cddb'). Also, two debug options are included. Use "<b>-V,</b> <b>-Verbose</b>"  to  get  verbose  output  of  what  the
       program  is  doing.  This  helps me locate the problem if you email me your problem. Use "<b>-R,</b> <b>-Remove</b>" to
       prevent disc-cover from deleting temporary files. This enables you to examine intermediate  files  (.tex,
       .div, pictures).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       1.  Whenever  there is more than one file in the cddb cache directory disc-cover will issue a warning and
           just use the first one it found.

       2.  Not possible to use CDINDEX files as input.

       3.  The layout of the tracks can be slightly deformed when special international characters or any  other
           tall characters appear in the title.
