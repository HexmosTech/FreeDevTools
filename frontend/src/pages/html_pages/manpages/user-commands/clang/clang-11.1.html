</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       clang - the Clang C, C++, and Objective-C compiler

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>clang</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>filename</u> <u>…</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>clang</b>  is a C, C++, and Objective-C compiler which encompasses preprocessing, parsing, optimization, code
       generation, assembly, and linking.  Depending on which high-level mode setting is passed, Clang will stop
       before doing a full link.  While Clang is highly integrated, it is important to understand the stages  of
       compilation, to understand how to invoke it.  These stages are:

       <b>Driver</b> The  clang  executable  is  actually  a small driver which controls the overall execution of other
              tools such as the compiler, assembler and linker.  Typically you do not need to interact with  the
              driver, but you transparently use it to run the other tools.

       <b>Preprocessing</b>
              This  stage handles tokenization of the input source file, macro expansion, #include expansion and
              handling of other preprocessor directives.  The output of this stage is typically  called  a  “.i”
              (for C), “.ii” (for C++), “.mi” (for Objective-C), or “.mii” (for Objective-C++) file.

       <b>Parsing</b> <b>and</b> <b>Semantic</b> <b>Analysis</b>
              This  stage parses the input file, translating preprocessor tokens into a parse tree.  Once in the
              form of a parse tree, it applies semantic analysis to compute types for expressions  as  well  and
              determine  whether  the  code is well formed. This stage is responsible for generating most of the
              compiler warnings as well as parse errors. The output of this stage is an “Abstract  Syntax  Tree”
              (AST).

       <b>Code</b> <b>Generation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Optimization</b>
              This  stage translates an AST into low-level intermediate code (known as “LLVM IR”) and ultimately
              to machine code.  This phase is  responsible  for  optimizing  the  generated  code  and  handling
              target-specific  code  generation.   The  output  of this stage is typically called a “.s” file or
              “assembly” file.

              Clang also supports the use of an integrated assembler,  in  which  the  code  generator  produces
              object  files  directly.  This  avoids the overhead of generating the “.s” file and of calling the
              target assembler.

       <b>Assembler</b>
              This stage runs the target assembler to translate the output of the compiler into a target  object
              file. The output of this stage is typically called a “.o” file or “object” file.

       <b>Linker</b> This  stage  runs  the  target linker to merge multiple object files into an executable or dynamic
              library. The output of this stage is typically called an “a.out”, “.dylib” or “.so” file.

       <b>Clang</b> <b>Static</b> <b>Analyzer</b>

       The Clang Static Analyzer is a tool that scans source code to try to find  bugs  through  code  analysis.
       This   tool   uses   many   parts   of  Clang  and  is  built  into  the  same  driver.   Please  see  &lt;‐
       <u>https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org</u>&gt; for more details on how to use the static analyzer.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Stage</b> <b>Selection</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-E</b>     Run the preprocessor stage.

       <b>-fsyntax-only</b>
              Run the preprocessor, parser and type checking stages.

              Supported values for the CUDA language are:
                 <b>cuda</b>

                     NVIDIA CUDA(tm)

       <b>-stdlib=&lt;library&gt;</b>
              Specify the C++ standard library to use; supported  options  are  libstdc++  and  libc++.  If  not
              specified, platform default will be used.

       <b>-rtlib=&lt;library&gt;</b>
              Specify  the compiler runtime library to use; supported options are libgcc and compiler-rt. If not
              specified, platform default will be used.

       <b>-ansi</b>  Same as -std=c89.

       <b>-ObjC,</b> <b>-ObjC++</b>
              Treat source input files as Objective-C and Object-C++ inputs respectively.

       <b>-trigraphs</b>
              Enable trigraphs.

       <b>-ffreestanding</b>
              Indicate that the file should be compiled for a freestanding, not a hosted, environment. Note that
              it is assumed that a freestanding environment will additionally provide  <u>memcpy</u>,  <u>memmove</u>,  <u>memset</u>
              and <u>memcmp</u> implementations, as these are needed for efficient codegen for many programs.

       <b>-fno-builtin</b>
              Disable special handling and optimizations of builtin functions like <b>strlen()</b> and <b>malloc()</b>.

       <b>-fmath-errno</b>
              Indicate that math functions should be treated as updating <b>errno</b>.

       <b>-fpascal-strings</b>
              Enable support for Pascal-style strings with “\pfoo”.

       <b>-fms-extensions</b>
              Enable support for Microsoft extensions.

       <b>-fmsc-version=</b>
              Set _MSC_VER. Defaults to 1300 on Windows. Not set otherwise.

       <b>-fborland-extensions</b>
              Enable support for Borland extensions.

       <b>-fwritable-strings</b>
              Make  all  string  literals  default  to  writable.   This  disables uniquing of strings and other
              optimizations.

       <b>-flax-vector-conversions,</b> <b>-flax-vector-conversions=&lt;kind&gt;,</b> <b>-fno-lax-vector-conversions</b>
              Allow loose type checking rules for implicit vector conversions.  Possible values of &lt;kind&gt;:

              • <b>none</b>: allow no implicit conversions between vectors

              • <b>integer</b>: allow implicit bitcasts between integer vectors of the same overall bit-width

              • <b>all</b>: allow implicit bitcasts between any vectors of the same overall bit-width

              &lt;kind&gt; defaults to <b>integer</b> if unspecified.

       <b>-fblocks</b>
              Enable the “Blocks” language feature.

       <b>-fobjc-abi-version=version</b>
              Select the Objective-C ABI version to use. Available versions are  1  (legacy  “fragile”  ABI),  2
              (non-fragile ABI 1), and 3 (non-fragile ABI 2).

       <b>-fobjc-nonfragile-abi-version=&lt;version&gt;</b>
              Select  the  Objective-C  non-fragile ABI version to use by default. This will only be used as the
              Objective-C ABI when the non-fragile ABI is enabled (either via <u>-fobjc-nonfragile-abi</u>, or  because
              it is the platform default).

       <b>-fobjc-nonfragile-abi,</b> <b>-fno-objc-nonfragile-abi</b>
              Enable  use of the Objective-C non-fragile ABI. On platforms for which this is the default ABI, it
              can be disabled with <u>-fno-objc-nonfragile-abi</u>.

   <b>Target</b> <b>Selection</b> <b>Options</b>
       Clang fully supports cross compilation as an inherent part of its design.  Depending on how your  version
       of Clang is configured, it may have support for a number of cross compilers, or may only support a native
       target.

       <b>-target</b> <b>&lt;architecture&gt;</b>
              Specify the architecture to build for.

       <b>--print-supported-cpus</b>
              Print   out   a   list   of   supported   processors  for  the  given  target  (specified  through
              –target=&lt;architecture&gt; or -arch &lt;architecture&gt;). If no target is  specified,  the  system  default
              target will be used.

       <b>-mcpu=?,</b> <b>-mtune=?</b>
              Aliases of –print-supported-cpus

       <b>-march=&lt;cpu&gt;</b>
              Specify  that  Clang  should  generate code for a specific processor family member and later.  For
              example, if you specify -march=i486, the compiler is allowed to  generate  instructions  that  are
              valid on i486 and later processors, but which may not exist on earlier ones.

   <b>Code</b> <b>Generation</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-O0,</b> <b>-O1,</b> <b>-O2,</b> <b>-O3,</b> <b>-Ofast,</b> <b>-Os,</b> <b>-Oz,</b> <b>-Og,</b> <b>-O,</b> <b>-O4</b>
              Specify which optimization level to use:
                 <u>-O0</u>  Means “no optimization”: this level compiles the fastest and generates the most debuggable
                 code.

                 <u>-O1</u> Somewhere between <u>-O0</u> and <u>-O2</u>.

                 <u>-O2</u> Moderate level of optimization which enables most optimizations.

                 <u>-O3</u> Like <u>-O2</u>, except that it enables optimizations that take longer  to  perform  or  that  may
                 generate larger code (in an attempt to make the program run faster).

                 <u>-Ofast</u>  Enables  all  the optimizations from <u>-O3</u> along with other aggressive optimizations that
                 may violate strict compliance with language standards.

                 <u>-Os</u> Like <u>-O2</u> with extra optimizations to reduce code size.

                 <u>-Oz</u> Like <u>-Os</u> (and thus <u>-O2</u>), but reduces code size further.

                 <u>-Og</u> Like <u>-O1</u>. In future versions, this option might disable different optimizations in order to
                 improve debuggability.

                 <u>-O</u> Equivalent to <u>-O1</u>.

                 <u>-O4</u> and higher
                     Currently equivalent to <u>-O3</u>

       <b>-g,</b> <b>-gline-tables-only,</b> <b>-gmodules</b>
              Control debug information output.  Note that Clang debug information works best at <u>-O0</u>.  When more
              than one option starting with <u>-g</u> is specified, the last one wins:
                 <b>-g</b> Generate debug information.

                 <b>-gline-tables-only</b> Generate only line table debug information.  This  allows  for  symbolicated
                 backtraces  with  inlining  information,  but does not include any information about variables,
                 their locations or types.

                 <u>-gmodules</u> Generate debug information that contains external  references  to  types  defined  in
                 Clang  modules or precompiled headers instead of emitting redundant debug type information into
                 every object file.  This option transparently switches the Clang module format to  object  file
                 containers  that  hold  the Clang module together with the debug information.  When compiling a
                 program that uses Clang modules or precompiled headers, this  option  produces  complete  debug
                 information with faster compile times and much smaller object files.

                 This  option  should  not  be  used  when  building  static libraries for distribution to other
                 machines because the debug info will contain references to the module cache on the machine  the
                 object files in the library were built on.

       <b>-fstandalone-debug</b> <b>-fno-standalone-debug</b>
              Clang  supports  a  number of optimizations to reduce the size of debug information in the binary.
              They work based on the assumption that the debug type information can be spread out over  multiple
              compilation  units.   For  instance,  Clang  will not emit type definitions for types that are not
              needed by a module and could be replaced with a forward declaration.   Further,  Clang  will  only
              emit type info for a dynamic C++ class in the module that contains the vtable for the class.

              The  <b>-fstandalone-debug</b>  option  turns  off these optimizations.  This is useful when working with
              3rd-party libraries that don’t come with debug information.  This is the default on Darwin.   Note
              that  Clang  will  never  emit  type  information  for types that are not referenced at all by the
              program.

       <b>-fexceptions</b>
              Enable generation of unwind information.  This  allows  exceptions  to  be  thrown  through  Clang
              compiled stack frames.  This is on by default in x86-64.

       <b>-ftrapv</b>
              Generate  code  to catch integer overflow errors.  Signed integer overflow is undefined in C. With
              this flag, extra code is generated to detect this and abort when it happens.

       <b>-fvisibility</b>
              This flag sets the default visibility level.

       <b>-fcommon,</b> <b>-fno-common</b>
              This flag specifies that variables without initializers get common linkage.  It  can  be  disabled
              with <u>-fno-common</u>.

       <b>-ftls-model=&lt;model&gt;</b>
              Set  the  default thread-local storage (TLS) model to use for thread-local variables. Valid values
              are:  “global-dynamic”,  “local-dynamic”,  “initial-exec”  and  “local-exec”.   The   default   is
              “global-dynamic”.  The  default model can be overridden with the tls_model attribute. The compiler
              will try to choose a more efficient model if possible.

       <b>-flto,</b> <b>-flto=full,</b> <b>-flto=thin,</b> <b>-emit-llvm</b>
              Generate output files in LLVM formats, suitable for link time optimization.   When  used  with  <u>-S</u>
              this  generates  LLVM  intermediate language assembly files, otherwise this generates LLVM bitcode
              format object files (which may be passed to the linker depending on the stage selection options).

              The default for <u>-flto</u> is “full”, in which the LLVM bitcode is suitable for  monolithic  Link  Time
              Optimization  (LTO),  where  the  linker merges all such modules into a single combined module for
              optimization. With “thin”, ThinLTO compilation is invoked instead.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 On Darwin, when using <u>-flto</u> along with <b>-g</b> and compiling and linking in separate steps, you also
                 need to pass <b>-Wl,-object_path_lto,&lt;lto-filename&gt;.o</b> at the linking step  to  instruct  the  ld64
                 linker  not  to  delete the temporary object file generated during Link Time Optimization (this
                 flag is automatically passed to the linker by Clang if compilation and linking are  done  in  a
                 single step). This allows debugging the executable as well as generating the <b>.dSYM</b> bundle using
                 <b><a href="../man1/dsymutil.1.html">dsymutil</a>(1)</b>.

   <b>Driver</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-###</b>   Print (but do not run) the commands to run for this compilation.

   <b>Preprocessor</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-D&lt;macroname&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Adds  an  implicit  #define  into  the  predefines  buffer which is read before the source file is
              preprocessed.

       <b>-U&lt;macroname&gt;</b>
              Adds an implicit #undef into the predefines buffer  which  is  read  before  the  source  file  is
              preprocessed.

       <b>-include</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Adds  an  implicit  #include  into  the  predefines buffer which is read before the source file is
              preprocessed.

       <b>-I&lt;directory&gt;</b>
              Add the specified directory to the search path for include files.

       <b>-F&lt;directory&gt;</b>
              Add the specified directory to the search path for framework include files.

       <b>-nostdinc</b>
              Do not search the standard system directories or compiler builtin directories for include files.

       <b>-nostdlibinc</b>
              Do not search the standard system directories for include files, but do  search  compiler  builtin
              include directories.

       <b>-nobuiltininc</b>
              Do not search clang’s builtin directory for include files.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>TMPDIR,</b> <b>TEMP,</b> <b>TMP</b>
              These  environment variables are checked, in order, for the location to write temporary files used
              during the compilation process.

       <b>CPATH</b>  If this environment variable is present, it is treated as a delimited list of paths to be added to
              the default system include path list. The delimiter is the platform dependent delimiter,  as  used
              in the PATH environment variable.

              Empty components in the environment variable are ignored.

       <b>C_INCLUDE_PATH,</b> <b>OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH,</b> <b>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH,</b> <b>OBJCPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</b>
              These  environment  variables  specify  additional  paths,  as for <u>CPATH</u>, which are only used when
              processing the appropriate language.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       To report bugs, please visit &lt;<u>https://bugs.llvm.org/</u>&gt;.  Most  bug  reports  should  include  preprocessed
       source  files  (use  the  <u>-E</u>  option)  and  the  full  output  of the compiler, along with information to
       reproduce.
