       cabextract - program to extract files from Microsoft cabinet (.cab) archives

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cabextract</b>  [<b>-d</b><u>dir</u><b>]</b> [<b>-e</b><u>encoding</u><b>]</b> [<b>-f</b>] [<b>-F</b><u>pattern</u><b>]</b> [<b>-h</b>] [<b>-i</b>] [<b>-k</b>] [<b>-l</b>] [<b>-L</b>] [<b>-n</b>] [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-q</b>] [<b>-s</b>] [<b>-t</b>] [<b>-v</b>]
       <u>cabinet</u> <u>files</u> <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cabextract</b> is a program that un-archives files in the Microsoft cabinet file format (.cab) or any  binary
       file which contains an embedded cabinet file (frequently found in .exe files).

       <b>cabextract</b> will extract all files from all cabinet files specified on the command line.

       To  extract  a  multi-part  cabinet  consisting of several files, only the <u>first</u> cabinet file needs to be
       given as an argument to <b>cabextract</b> as it will automatically look for  the  remaining  files.  To  prevent
       <b>cabextract</b> from extracting cabinet files you did not specify, use the <b>-s</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A summary of options is included below.

       <b>-d</b> <u>dir</u> Extracts all files into the directory <u>dir</u>.

       <b>-e</b> <u>encoding</u>
              Specify  the character encoding of filenames inside the cabinet files.  This is only needed if you
              find cabinet files with garbled filenames; most software creates CAB files with  either  ASCII  or
              UTF8 filenames.  The list of supported encodings is given by the command "iconv -l".

       <b>-f</b>     Corrupted  cabinet  files  will be 'fixed' to salvage whatever is possible from them. File entries
              with bad folders or names will  be  skipped  rather  than  rejecting   the  entire  cabinet  file.
              Impossible  file  lengths  will be truncated to extract as much as possible, including when you're
              missing later files in a cabinet set. Corrupted MSZIP blocks and failed block  checksums  will  be
              ignored.  Warnings will be printed if any of these conditions are met.

       <b>-F</b> <u>pattern</u>
              Only  files  with names that match the shell pattern <u>pattern</u> shall be listed, tested or extracted.
              On non-GNU systems, this match may be case-sensitive. Use the option  repeatedly  to  supply  more
              than one pattern.  Files will be listed, tested or extracted if they match <u>any</u> pattern.

       <b>-h</b>     Prints a page of help and exits.

       <b>-i</b>     Prompts before overwriting files.

       <b>-k</b>     Don't overwrite symlinks when extracting files.

       <b>-l</b>     Lists the contents of the given cabinet files, rather than extracting them.

       <b>-L</b>     When extracting cabinet files, makes each extracted file's name lowercase.

       <b>-n</b>     Never overwrite existing files.

       <b>-p</b>     Files shall be extracted to standard output.

       <b>-q</b>     When extracting cabinet files, suppresses all messages except errors and warnings.

       <b>-s</b>     When  testing,  listing or extracting cabinets which span multiple files, only cabinet files given
              on the command line shall be used.

       <b>-t</b>     Tests the integrity of the cabinet. Files are decompressed, but not written to  disk  or  standard
              output. If the file successfully decompresses, the MD5 checksum of the file is printed.

       <b>-v</b>     If  given alone on the command line, prints the version of <b>cabextract</b> and exits. Given with a list
              of cabinet files, it will list the contents of the cabinet files.
