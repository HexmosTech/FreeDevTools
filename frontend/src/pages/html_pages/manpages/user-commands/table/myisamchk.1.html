<b>MYISAMCHK</b>(1)                                 MariaDB Database System                                <b>MYISAMCHK</b>(1)

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       myisamchk - MyISAM table-maintenance utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>myisamchk</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b> <u>tbl_name</u> <b>...</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>myisamchk</b> utility gets information about your database tables or checks, repairs, or optimizes them.
       <b>myisamchk</b> works with MyISAM tables (tables that have .MYD and .MYI files for storing data and indexes).

       The use of <b>myisamchk</b> with partitioned tables is not supported.

           <b>Caution</b>

           It is best to make a backup of a table before performing a table repair operation; under some
           circumstances the operation might cause data loss. Possible causes include but are not limited to
           file system errors.

       Invoke <b>myisamchk</b> like this:

           shell&gt; <b>myisamchk</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b> <u>tbl_name</u> <b>...</b>

       The <u>options</u> specify what you want <b>myisamchk</b> to do. They are described in the following sections. You can
       also get a list of options by invoking <b>myisamchk</b> <b>--help</b>.

       With no options, <b>myisamchk</b> simply checks your table as the default operation. To get more information or
       to tell <b>myisamchk</b> to take corrective action, specify options as described in the following discussion.

       <u>tbl_name</u> is the database table you want to check or repair. If you run <b>myisamchk</b> somewhere other than in
       the database directory, you must specify the path to the database directory, because <b>myisamchk</b> has no
       idea where the database is located. In fact, <b>myisamchk</b> does not actually care whether the files you are
       working on are located in a database directory. You can copy the files that correspond to a database
       table into some other location and perform recovery operations on them there.

       You can name several tables on the <b>myisamchk</b> command line if you wish. You can also specify a table by
       naming its index file (the file with the .MYI suffix). This allows you to specify all tables in a
       directory by using the pattern *.MYI. For example, if you are in a database directory, you can check all
       the MyISAM tables in that directory like this:

           shell&gt; <b>myisamchk</b> <b>*.MYI</b>

       If you are not in the database directory, you can check all the tables there by specifying the path to
       the directory:

           shell&gt; <b>myisamchk</b> <u>/path/to/database_dir/</u><b>*.MYI</b>

       You can even check all tables in all databases by specifying a wildcard with the path to the MariaDB data
       directory:

           shell&gt; <b>myisamchk</b> <u>/path/to/datadir/*/*</u><b>.MYI</b>

       The recommended way to quickly check all MyISAM tables is:

           shell&gt; <b>myisamchk</b> <b>--silent</b> <b>--fast</b> <u>/path/to/datadir/*/*</u><b>.MYI</b>

       If you want to check all MyISAM tables and repair any that are corrupted, you can use the following
       command:

           shell&gt; <b>myisamchk</b> <b>--silent</b> <b>--force</b> <b>--fast</b> <b>--update-state</b> <b>\</b>
                     <b>--key_buffer_size=64M</b> <b>--sort_buffer_size=64M</b> <b>\</b>
                     <b>--read_buffer_size=1M</b> <b>--write_buffer_size=1M</b> <b>\</b>
                     <u>/path/to/datadir/*/*</u><b>.MYI</b>

       This command assumes that you have more than 64MB free. For more information about memory allocation with
       <b>myisamchk</b>, see the section called “MYISAMCHK MEMORY USAGE”.

           <b>Important</b>

           <u>You</u> <u>must</u> <u>ensure</u> <u>that</u> <u>no</u> <u>other</u> <u>program</u> <u>is</u> <u>using</u> <u>the</u> <u>tables</u> <u>while</u> <u>you</u> <u>are</u> <u>running</u> <b>myisamchk</b>. The most
           effective means of doing so is to shut down the MariaDB server while running <b>myisamchk</b>, or to lock
           all tables that <b>myisamchk</b> is being used on.

           Otherwise, when you run <b>myisamchk</b>, it may display the following error message:

               warning: clients are using or haven't closed the table properly

           This means that you are trying to check a table that has been updated by another program (such as the
           <b>mariadbd</b> server) that hasn't yet closed the file or that has died without closing the file properly,
           which can sometimes lead to the corruption of one or more MyISAM tables.

           If <b>mariadbd</b> is running, you must force it to flush any table modifications that are still buffered in
           memory by using FLUSH TABLES. You should then ensure that no one is using the tables while you are
           running <b>myisamchk</b>

           However, the easiest way to avoid this problem is to use CHECK TABLE instead of <b>myisamchk</b> to check
           tables.

       <b>myisamchk</b> supports the following options, which can be specified on the command line or in the
       [myisamchk] option file group.

</pre><h4><b>MYISAMCHK</b> <b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options described in this section can be used for any type of table maintenance operation performed
       by <b>myisamchk</b>. The sections following this one describe options that pertain only to specific operations,
       such as table checking or repairing.

       •   <b>--help</b>, <b>-?</b>

           Display a help message and exit. Options are grouped by type of operation.

       •   <b>--HELP</b>, <b>-H</b>

           Display a help message and exit. Options are presented in a single list.

       •   <b>--debug=</b><u>debug_options</u>, <b>-#</b> <u>debug_options</u>

           Write a debugging log. A typical <u>debug_options</u> string is 'd:t:o,<u>file_name</u>'. The default is
           'd:t:o,/tmp/myisamchk.trace'.

       •   <b>--silent</b>, <b>-s</b>

           Silent mode. Write output only when errors occur. You can use <b>-s</b> twice (<b>-ss</b>) to make <b>myisamchk</b> very
           silent.

       •   <b>--verbose</b>, <b>-v</b>

           Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does. This can be used with <b>-d</b> and <b>-e</b>.
           Use <b>-v</b> multiple times (<b>-vv</b>, <b>-vvv</b>) for even more output.

       •   <b>--version</b>, <b>-V</b>

           Display version information and exit.

       •   <b>--wait</b>, <b>-w</b>

           Instead of terminating with an error if the table is locked, wait until the table is unlocked before
           continuing. If you are running <b>mariadbd</b> with external locking disabled, the table can be locked only
           by another <b>myisamchk</b> command.

       •   <b>--print-defaults</b>

           Print the program argument list and exit.

       •   <b>--no-defaults</b>

           Don't read default options from any option file.

       •   <b>--defaults-file=#</b>

           Only read default options from the given file.

       •   <b>--defaults-extra-file=#</b>

           Read this file after the global files are read.

       You can also set the following variables by using <b>--</b><u>var_name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u> syntax:
       ┌──────────────────────┬───────────────────┐
       │ <b>Variable</b>             │ <b>Default</b> <b>Value</b>     │
       ├──────────────────────┼───────────────────┤

       └──────────────────────┴───────────────────┘

       The possible <b>myisamchk</b> variables and their default values can be examined with <b>myisamchk</b> <b>--help</b>:

       sort_buffer_size is used when the keys are repaired by sorting keys, which is the normal case when you
       use <b>--recover</b>.

       key_buffer_size is used when you are checking the table with <b>--extend-check</b> or when the keys are repaired
       by inserting keys row by row into the table (like when doing normal inserts). Repairing through the key
       buffer is used in the following cases:

       •   You use <b>--safe-recover</b>.

       •   The temporary files needed to sort the keys would be more than twice as big as when creating the key
           file directly. This is often the case when you have large key values for CHAR, VARCHAR, or TEXT
           columns, because the sort operation needs to store the complete key values as it proceeds. If you
           have lots of temporary space and you can force <b>myisamchk</b> to repair by sorting, you can use the
           <b>--sort-recover</b> option.

       Repairing through the key buffer takes much less disk space than using sorting, but is also much slower.

       If you want a faster repair, set the key_buffer_size and sort_buffer_size variables to about 25% of your
       available memory. You can set both variables to large values, because only one of them is used at a time.

       myisam_block_size is the size used for index blocks.

       stats_method influences how NULL values are treated for index statistics collection when the <b>--analyze</b>
       option is given. It acts like the myisam_stats_method system variable. For more information, see the
       description of myisam_stats_method in Section 5.1.4, “Server System Variables”, and Section 7.4.7,
       “MyISAM Index Statistics Collection”.

       ft_min_word_len and ft_max_word_len indicate the minimum and maximum word length for FULLTEXT indexes.
       ft_stopword_file names the stopword file. These need to be set under the following circumstances.

       If you use <b>myisamchk</b> to perform an operation that modifies table indexes (such as repair or analyze), the
       FULLTEXT indexes are rebuilt using the default full-text parameter values for minimum and maximum word
       length and the stopword file unless you specify otherwise. This can result in queries failing.

       The problem occurs because these parameters are known only by the server. They are not stored in MyISAM
       index files. To avoid the problem if you have modified the minimum or maximum word length or the stopword
       file in the server, specify the same ft_min_word_len, ft_max_word_len, and ft_stopword_file values to
       <b>myisamchk</b> that you use for <b>mariadbd</b>. For example, if you have set the minimum word length to 3, you can
       repair a table with <b>myisamchk</b> like this:

           shell&gt; <b>myisamchk</b> <b>--recover</b> <b>--ft_min_word_len=3</b> <u>tbl_name</u><b>.MYI</b>

       To ensure that <b>myisamchk</b> and the server use the same values for full-text parameters, you can place each
       one in both the [mariadbd] and [myisamchk] sections of an option file:

           [mariadbd]
           ft_min_word_len=3
           [myisamchk]
           ft_min_word_len=3

       An alternative to using <b>myisamchk</b> is to use the REPAIR TABLE, ANALYZE TABLE, OPTIMIZE TABLE, or ALTER
       TABLE. These statements are performed by the server, which knows the proper full-text parameter values to
       use.

</pre><h4><b>MYISAMCHK</b> <b>CHECK</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>myisamchk</b> supports the following options for table checking operations:

       •   <b>--check</b>, <b>-c</b>

           Check the table for errors. This is the default operation if you specify no option that selects an
           operation type explicitly.

       •   <b>--check-only-changed</b>, <b>-C</b>

           Check only tables that have changed since the last check.

       •   <b>--extend-check</b>, <b>-e</b>

           Check the table very thoroughly. This is quite slow if the table has many indexes. This option should
           only be used in extreme cases. Normally, <b>myisamchk</b> or <b>myisamchk</b> <b>--medium-check</b> should be able to
           determine whether there are any errors in the table.

           If you are using <b>--extend-check</b> and have plenty of memory, setting the key_buffer_size variable to a
           large value helps the repair operation run faster.

           For a description of the output format, see the section called “MYISAMCHK TABLE INFORMATION”.

       •   <b>--fast</b>, <b>-F</b>

           Check only tables that haven't been closed properly.

       •   <b>--force</b>, <b>-f</b>

           Do a repair operation automatically if <b>myisamchk</b> finds any errors in the table. The repair type is
           the same as that specified with the <b>--recover</b> or <b>-r</b> option. States will be updated as with
           <b>--update-state</b>.

       •   <b>--information</b>, <b>-i</b>

           Print informational statistics about the table that is checked.

       •   <b>--medium-check</b>, <b>-m</b>

           Do a check that is faster than an <b>--extend-check</b> operation. This finds only 99.99% of all errors,
           which should be good enough in most cases.

       •   <b>--read-only</b>, <b>-T</b>

           Do not mark the table as checked. This is useful if you use <b>myisamchk</b> to check a table that is in use
           by some other application that does not use locking, such as <b>mariadbd</b> when run with external locking
           disabled.

       •   <b>--update-state</b>, <b>-U</b>

           Store information in the .MYI file to indicate when the table was checked and whether the table
           crashed. This should be used to get full benefit of the <b>--check-only-changed</b> option, but you
           shouldn't use this option if the <b>mariadbd</b> server is using the table and you are running it with
           external locking disabled.

</pre><h4><b>MYISAMCHK</b> <b>REPAIR</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>myisamchk</b> supports the following options for table repair operations (operations performed when an option
       such as <b>--recover</b> or <b>--safe-recover</b> is given):

       •   <b>--backup</b>, <b>-B</b>

           Make a backup of the .MYD file as <u>file_name</u>-<u>time</u>.BAK

       •   <b>--character-sets-dir=</b><u>path</u>

           The directory where character sets are installed.

       •   <b>--correct-checksum</b>

           Correct the checksum information for the table.

       •   <b>--create-missing-keys</b>

           Create missing keys. This assumes that the data file is correct and that the number of rows stored in
           the index file is correct. Enables <b>--quick</b>.

       •   <b>--data-file-length=</b><u>len</u>, <b>-D</b> <u>len</u>

           The maximum length of the data file (when re-creating data file when it is “full”).

       •   <b>--extend-check</b>, <b>-e</b>

           Do a repair that tries to recover every possible row from the data file. Normally, this also finds a
           lot of garbage rows. Do not use this option unless you are desperate.

           For a description of the output format, see the section called “MYISAMCHK TABLE INFORMATION”.

       •   <b>--force</b>, <b>-f</b>

           Overwrite old intermediate files (files with names like <u>tbl_name</u>.TMD) instead of aborting. Add
           another <b>--force</b> to avoid 'myisam_sort_buffer_size is too small' errors. In this case we will attempt
           to do the repair with the given <b>myisam_sort_buffer_size</b> and dynamically allocate as many management
           buffers as needed.

       •   <b>--keys-used=</b><u>val</u>, <b>-k</b> <u>val</u>

           For <b>myisamchk</b>, the option value is a bit-value that indicates which indexes to update. Each binary
           bit of the option value corresponds to a table index, where the first index is bit 0. An option value
           of 0 disables updates to all indexes, which can be used to get faster inserts. Deactivated indexes
           can be reactivated by using <b>myisamchk</b> <b>-r</b>.

       •   <b>--max-record-length=</b><u>len</u>

           Skip rows larger than the given length if <b>myisamchk</b> cannot allocate memory to hold them.

       •   <b>--parallel-recover</b>, <b>-p</b>

           Use the same technique as <b>-r</b> and <b>-n</b>, but create all the keys in parallel, using different threads.
           <u>This</u> <u>is</u> <u>beta-quality</u> <u>code.</u> <u>Use</u> <u>at</u> <u>your</u> <u>own</u> <u>risk!</u>

       •   <b>--quick</b>, <b>-q</b>

           Achieve a faster repair by modifying only the index file, not the data file. You can specify this
           option twice to force <b>myisamchk</b> to modify the original data file in case of duplicate keys. NOTE:
           Tables where the data file is corrupted can't be fixed with this option.

       •   <b>--recover</b>, <b>-r</b>

           Do a repair that can fix almost any problem except unique keys that are not unique (which is an
           extremely unlikely error with MyISAM tables). If you want to recover a table, this is the option to
           try first. You should try <b>--safe-recover</b> only if <b>myisamchk</b> reports that the table cannot be recovered
           using <b>--recover</b>. (In the unlikely case that <b>--recover</b> fails, the data file remains intact.)

           If you have lots of memory, you should increase the value of sort_buffer_size.

       •   <b>--safe-recover</b>, <b>-o</b>

           Do a repair using an old recovery method that reads through all rows in order and updates all index
           trees based on the rows found. This is an order of magnitude slower than <b>--recover</b>, but can handle a
           couple of very unlikely cases that <b>--recover</b> cannot. This recovery method also uses much less disk
           space than <b>--recover</b>. Normally, you should repair first using <b>--recover</b>, and then with <b>--safe-recover</b>
           only if <b>--recover</b> fails.

           If you have lots of memory, you should increase the value of key_buffer_size.

       •   <b>--set-collation=</b><u>name</u>

           Specify the collation to use for sorting table indexes. The character set name is implied by the
           first part of the collation name.

       •   <b>--sort-recover</b>, <b>-n</b>

           Force <b>myisamchk</b> to use sorting to resolve the keys even if the temporary files would be very large.

       •   <b>--tmpdir=</b><u>path</u>, <b>-t</b> <u>path</u>

           The path of the directory to be used for storing temporary files. If this is not set, <b>myisamchk</b> uses
           the value of the TMPDIR environment variable.  tmpdir can be set to a list of directory paths that
           are used successively in round-robin fashion for creating temporary files. The separator character
           between directory names is the colon (“:”) on Unix and the semicolon (“;”) on Windows, NetWare, and
           OS/2.

       •   <b>--unpack</b>, <b>-u</b>

           Unpack a table that was packed with <b>myisampack</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>MYISAMCHK</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>myisamchk</b> supports the following options for actions other than table checks and repairs:

       •   <b>--analyze</b>, <b>-a</b>

           Analyze the distribution of key values. This improves join performance by enabling the join optimizer
           to better choose the order in which to join the tables and which indexes it should use. To obtain
           information about the key distribution, use a <b>myisamchk</b> <b>--description</b> <b>--verbose</b> <u>tbl_name</u> command or
           the SHOW INDEX FROM <u>tbl_name</u> statement.

       •   <b>--block-search=</b><u>offset</u>, <b>-b</b> <u>offset</u>

           Find the record that a block at the given offset belongs to.

       •   <b>--description</b>, <b>-d</b>

           Print some descriptive information about the table. Specifying the <b>--verbose</b> option once or twice
           produces additional information. See the section called “MYISAMCHK TABLE INFORMATION”.

       •   <b>--set-auto-increment[=</b><u>value</u><b>]</b>, <b>-A[</b><u>value</u><b>]</b>

           Force AUTO_INCREMENT numbering for new records to start at the given value (or higher, if there are
           existing records with AUTO_INCREMENT values this large). If <u>value</u> is not specified, AUTO_INCREMENT
           numbers for new records begin with the largest value currently in the table, plus one.

       •   <b>--sort-index</b>, <b>-S</b>

           Sort the index tree blocks in high-low order. This optimizes seeks and makes table scans that use
           indexes faster.

       •   <b>--sort-records=</b><u>N</u>, <b>-R</b> <u>N</u>

           Sort records according to a particular index. This makes your data much more localized and may speed
           up range-based SELECT and ORDER BY operations that use this index. (The first time you use this
           option to sort a table, it may be very slow.) To determine a table's index numbers, use SHOW INDEX,
           which displays a table's indexes in the same order that <b>myisamchk</b> sees them. Indexes are numbered
           beginning with 1.

           If keys are not packed (PACK_KEYS=0), they have the same length, so when <b>myisamchk</b> sorts and moves
           records, it just overwrites record offsets in the index. If keys are packed (PACK_KEYS=1), <b>myisamchk</b>
           must unpack key blocks first, then re-create indexes and pack the key blocks again. (In this case,
           re-creating indexes is faster than updating offsets for each index.)

       •   <b>--stats-method=name</b>

           Specifies how index statistics collection code should treat NULLs. Possible values of name are
           "nulls_unequal" (default), "nulls_equal" (emulate MySQL 4 behavior), and "nulls_ignored".

</pre><h4><b>MYISAMCHK</b> <b>TABLE</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       To obtain a description of a MyISAM table or statistics about it, use the commands shown here. The output
       from these commands is explained later in this section.

       •   <b>myisamchk</b> <b>-d</b> <u>tbl_name</u>

           Runs <b>myisamchk</b> in “describe mode” to produce a description of your table. If you start the MariaDB
           server with external locking disabled, <b>myisamchk</b> may report an error for a table that is updated
           while it runs. However, because <b>myisamchk</b> does not change the table in describe mode, there is no
           risk of destroying data.

       •   <b>myisamchk</b> <b>-dv</b> <u>tbl_name</u>

           Adding <b>-v</b> runs <b>myisamchk</b> in verbose mode so that it produces more information about the table. Adding
           <b>-v</b> a second time produces even more information.

       •   <b>myisamchk</b> <b>-eis</b> <u>tbl_name</u>

           Shows only the most important information from a table. This operation is slow because it must read
           the entire table.

       •   <b>myisamchk</b> <b>-eiv</b> <u>tbl_name</u>

           This is like <b>-eis</b>, but tells you what is being done.

       The <u>tbl_name</u> argument can be either the name of a MyISAM table or the name of its index file, as
       described in <b><a href="../man1/myisamchk.1.html">myisamchk</a></b>(1). Multiple <u>tbl_name</u> arguments can be given.

       Suppose that a table named person has the following structure. (The MAX_ROWS table option is included so
       that in the example output from <b>myisamchk</b> shown later, some values are smaller and fit the output format
       more easily.)

           CREATE TABLE person
           (
             id         INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
             last_name  <a href="../man20/VARCHAR.20.html">VARCHAR</a>(20) NOT NULL,
             first_name <a href="../man20/VARCHAR.20.html">VARCHAR</a>(20) NOT NULL,
             birth      DATE,
             death      DATE,
             PRIMARY KEY (id),
             INDEX (last_name, first_name),
             INDEX (birth)
           ) MAX_ROWS = 1000000;

       Suppose also that the table has these data and index file sizes:

           -rw-rw----  1 mysql  mysql  9347072 Aug 19 11:47 person.MYD
           -rw-rw----  1 mysql  mysql  6066176 Aug 19 11:47 person.MYI

       Explanations for the types of information <b>myisamchk</b> produces are given here.  “Keyfile” refers to the
       index file.  “Record” and “row” are synonymous, as are “field” and “column.”

       The initial part of the table description contains these values:

       •   MyISAM file

           Name of the MyISAM (index) file.

       •   Record format

           The format used to store table rows. The preceding examples use Fixed length. Other possible values
           are Compressed and Packed. (Packed corresponds to what SHOW TABLE STATUS reports as Dynamic.)

       •   Chararacter set

           The table default character set.

       •   File-version

           Version of MyISAM format. Currently always 1.

       •   Creation time

           When the data file was created.

       •   Recover time

           When the index/data file was last reconstructed.

       •   Status

           Table status flags. Possible values are crashed, open, changed, analyzed, optimized keys, and sorted
           index pages.

       •   Auto increment key, Last value

           The key number associated the table's AUTO_INCREMENT column, and the most recently generated value
           for this column. These fields do not appear if there is no such column.

       •   Data records

           The number of rows in the table.

       •   Deleted blocks

           How many deleted blocks still have reserved space. You can optimize your table to minimize this
           space. See Section 6.6.4, “MyISAM Table Optimization”.

       •   Datafile parts

           For dynamic-row format, this indicates how many data blocks there are. For an optimized table without
           fragmented rows, this is the same as Data records.

       •   Deleted data

           How many bytes of unreclaimed deleted data there are. You can optimize your table to minimize this
           space. See Section 6.6.4, “MyISAM Table Optimization”.

       •   Datafile pointer

           The size of the data file pointer, in bytes. It is usually 2, 3, 4, or 5 bytes. Most tables manage
           with 2 bytes, but this cannot be controlled from MariaDB yet. For fixed tables, this is a row
           address. For dynamic tables, this is a byte address.

       •   Keyfile pointer

           The size of the index file pointer, in bytes. It is usually 1, 2, or 3 bytes. Most tables manage with
           2 bytes, but this is calculated automatically by MariaDB. It is always a block address.

       •   Max datafile length

           How long the table data file can become, in bytes.

       •   Max keyfile length

           How long the table index file can become, in bytes.

       •   Recordlength

           How much space each row takes, in bytes.

       The table description part of the output includes a list of all keys in the table. For each key,
       <b>myisamchk</b> displays some low-level information:

       •   Key

           This key's number. This value is shown only for the first column of the key. If this value is
           missing, the line corresponds to the second or later column of a multiple-column key. For the table
           shown in the example, there are two table description lines for the second index. This indicates that
           it is a multiple-part index with two parts.

       •   Start

           Where in the row this portion of the index starts.

       •   Len

           How long this portion of the index is. For packed numbers, this should always be the full length of
           the column. For strings, it may be shorter than the full length of the indexed column, because you
           can index a prefix of a string column. The total length of a multiple-part key is the sum of the Len
           values for all key parts.

       •   Index

           Whether a key value can exist multiple times in the index. Possible values are unique or multip.
           (multiple).

       •   Type

           What data type this portion of the index has. This is a MyISAM data type with the possible values
           packed, stripped, or empty.

       •   Root

           Address of the root index block.

       •   Blocksize

           The size of each index block. By default this is 1024, but the value may be changed at compile time
           when MariaDB is built from source.

       •   Rec/key

           This is a statistical value used by the optimizer. It tells how many rows there are per value for
           this index. A unique index always has a value of 1. This may be updated after a table is loaded (or
           greatly changed) with <b>myisamchk</b> <b>-a</b>. If this is not updated at all, a default value of 30 is given.

       The last part of the output provides information about each column:

       •   Field

           The column number.

       •   Start

           The byte position of the column within table rows.

       •   Length

           The length of the column in bytes.

       •   Nullpos, Nullbit

           For columns that can be NULL, MyISAM stores NULL values as a flag in a byte. Depending on how many
           nullable columns there are, there can be one or more bytes used for this purpose. The Nullpos and
           Nullbit values, if nonempty, indicate which byte and bit contains that flag indicating whether the
           column is NULL.

           The position and number of bytes used to store NULL flags is shown in the line for field 1. This is
           why there are six Field lines for the person table even though it has only five columns.

       •   Type

           The data type. The value may contain any of the following descriptors:

           •   constant

               All rows have the same value.

           •   no endspace

               Do not store endspace.

           •   no endspace, not_always

               Do not store endspace and do not do endspace compression for all values.

           •   no endspace, no empty

               Do not store endspace. Do not store empty values.

           •   table-lookup

               The column was converted to an ENUM.

           •   zerofill(<u>N</u>)

               The most significant <u>N</u> bytes in the value are always 0 and are not stored.

           •   no zeros

               Do not store zeros.

           •   always zero

               Zero values are stored using one bit.

       •   Huff tree

           The number of the Huffman tree associated with the column.

       •   Bits

           The number of bits used in the Huffman tree.

       The Huff tree and Bits fields are displayed if the table has been compressed with <b>myisampack</b>. See
       <b><a href="../man1/myisampack.1.html">myisampack</a></b>(1), for an example of this information.

       <b>myisamchk</b> <b>-eiv</b> output includes the following information:

       •   Data records

           The number of rows in the table.

       •   Deleted blocks

           How many deleted blocks still have reserved space. You can optimize your table to minimize this
           space. See Section 6.6.4, “MyISAM Table Optimization”.

       •   Key

           The key number.

       •   Keyblocks used

           What percentage of the keyblocks are used. When a table has just been reorganized with <b>myisamchk</b>, the
           values are very high (very near theoretical maximum).

       •   Packed

           MariaDB tries to pack key values that have a common suffix. This can only be used for indexes on CHAR
           and VARCHAR columns. For long indexed strings that have similar leftmost parts, this can
           significantly reduce the space used. In the preceding example, the second key is 40 bytes long and a
           97% reduction in space is achieved.

       •   Max levels

           How deep the B-tree for this key is. Large tables with long key values get high values.

       •   Records

           How many rows are in the table.

       •   M.recordlength

           The average row length. This is the exact row length for tables with fixed-length rows, because all
           rows have the same length.

       •   Packed

           MariaDB strips spaces from the end of strings. The Packed value indicates the percentage of savings
           achieved by doing this.

       •   Recordspace used

           What percentage of the data file is used.

       •   Empty space

           What percentage of the data file is unused.

       •   Blocks/Record

           Average number of blocks per row (that is, how many links a fragmented row is composed of). This is
           always 1.0 for fixed-format tables. This value should stay as close to 1.0 as possible. If it gets
           too large, you can reorganize the table. See Section 6.6.4, “MyISAM Table Optimization”.

       •   Recordblocks

           How many blocks (links) are used. For fixed-format tables, this is the same as the number of rows.

       •   Deleteblocks

           How many blocks (links) are deleted.

       •   Recorddata

           How many bytes in the data file are used.

       •   Deleted data

           How many bytes in the data file are deleted (unused).

       •   Lost space

           If a row is updated to a shorter length, some space is lost. This is the sum of all such losses, in
           bytes.

       •   Linkdata

           When the dynamic table format is used, row fragments are linked with pointers (4 to 7 bytes each).
           Linkdata is the sum of the amount of storage used by all such pointers.

</pre><h4><b>MYISAMCHK</b> <b>MEMORY</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Memory allocation is important when you run <b>myisamchk</b>.  <b>myisamchk</b> uses no more memory than its
       memory-related variables are set to. If you are going to use <b>myisamchk</b> on very large tables, you should
       first decide how much memory you want it to use. The default is to use only about 3MB to perform repairs.
       By using larger values, you can get <b>myisamchk</b> to operate faster. For example, if you have more than 32MB
       RAM, you could use options such as these (in addition to any other options you might specify):

           shell&gt; <b>myisamchk</b> <b>--sort_buffer_size=16M</b> <b>\</b>
                      <b>--key_buffer_size=16M</b> <b>\</b>
                      <b>--read_buffer_size=1M</b> <b>\</b>
                      <b>--write_buffer_size=1M</b> <b>...</b>

       Using <b>--sort_buffer_size=16M</b> should probably be enough for most cases.

       Be aware that <b>myisamchk</b> uses temporary files in TMPDIR. If TMPDIR points to a memory file system, out of
       memory errors can easily occur. If this happens, run <b>myisamchk</b> with the <b>--tmpdir=</b><u>path</u> option to specify a
       directory located on a file system that has more space.

       When performing repair operations, <b>myisamchk</b> also needs a lot of disk space:

       •   Twice the size of the data file (the original file and a copy). This space is not needed if you do a
           repair with <b>--quick</b>; in this case, only the index file is re-created.  <u>This</u> <u>space</u> <u>must</u> <u>be</u> <u>available</u>
           <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>file</u> <u>system</u> <u>as</u> <u>the</u> <u>original</u> <u>data</u> <u>file</u>, as the copy is created in the same directory as
           the original.

       •   Space for the new index file that replaces the old one. The old index file is truncated at the start
           of the repair operation, so you usually ignore this space. This space must be available on the same
           file system as the original data file.

       •   When using <b>--recover</b> or <b>--sort-recover</b> (but not when using <b>--safe-recover</b>), you need space on disk
           for sorting. This space is allocated in the temporary directory (specified by TMPDIR or
           <b>--tmpdir=</b><u>path</u>). The following formula yields the amount of space required:

               (<u>largest_key</u> + <u>row_pointer_length</u>) × <u>number_of_rows</u> × 2

           You can check the length of the keys and the <u>row_pointer_length</u> with <b>myisamchk</b> <b>-dv</b> <u>tbl_name</u> (see the
           section called “MYISAMCHK TABLE INFORMATION”). The <u>row_pointer_length</u> and <u>number_of_rows</u> values are
           the Datafile pointer and Data records values in the table description. To determine the <u>largest_key</u>
           value, check the Key lines in the table description. The Len column indicates the number of bytes for
           each key part. For a multiple-column index, the key size is the sum of the Len values for all key
           parts.

       If you have a problem with disk space during repair, you can try <b>--safe-recover</b> instead of <b>--recover</b>.
