</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       stilts-tapresume - Resumes a previous query to a Table Access Protocol server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>stilts</b> <b>tapresume</b> [joburl=<u>&lt;url-value&gt;</u>] [compress=<u>true|false</u>] [poll=<u>&lt;millisec&gt;</u>] [progress=<u>true|false</u>]
                        [delete=<u>finished|never|always|now</u>] [ocmd=<u>&lt;cmds&gt;</u>]
                        [omode=<u>out|meta|stats|count|checksum|cgi|discard|topcat|samp|tosql|gui</u>] [out=<u>&lt;out-</u>
                        <u>table&gt;</u>] [ofmt=<u>&lt;out-format&gt;</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>tapresume</u> can resume monitoring and data retrieval from an asynchronous Table Access Protocol query which
       has  already  been  submitted.  TAP is a Virtual Observatory protocol. Such a pre-existing query may have
       been submitted by the <u>tapquery</u> command or by some completely different mechanism. It essentially does the
       same job as <u>tapquery</u> but without the job submission stage. It waits until the query  has  completed,  and
       then  retrieves  the  table result and processes it in accordance with the supplied parameters. The query
       may or may not be deleted from the server as part of the operation.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>joburl=</b><u>&lt;url-value&gt;</u>
              The URL of a job created by submission of a TAP query which was created earlier and  has  not  yet
              been  deleted (by the client) or destroyed (by the server). This will usually be of the form <u>&lt;tap-</u>
              <u>url&gt;/async/&lt;job-id&gt;</u>. You can also find out, and possibly retrieve results from the job by pointing
              a web browser at this URL.

       <b>compress=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true, the service is requested to provide HTTP-level compression for the response  stream  (Ac‐
              cept-Encoding  header  is  set  to "<u>gzip</u>", see RFC 2616). This does not guarantee that compression
              will happen but if the service honours this request it may result in a smaller amount  of  network
              traffic at the expense of more processing on the server and client.

       <b>poll=</b><u>&lt;millisec&gt;</u>
              Interval to wait between polling attempts, in milliseconds. Asynchronous TAP queries can only find
              out when they are complete by repeatedly polling the server to find out the job's status. This pa‐
              rameter allows you to set how often that happens. Attempts to set it too low (&lt;50) will be reject‐
              ed on the assumption that you're thinking in seconds.

       <b>progress=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If this parameter is set true, progress of the job is reported to standard output as it happens.

       <b>delete=</b><u>finished|never|always|now</u>
              Determines  under what circumstances the UWS job is to be deleted from the server when its data is
              no longer required. If it is not deleted, then the job is left on the TAP server and it can be ac‐
              cessed via the normal UWS REST endpoints or using <u>tapresume</u> until it is destroyed by the server.

              Possible values:

                * <u>finished</u>: delete only if the job finished, successfully or not

                * <u>never</u>: do not delete

                * <u>always</u>: delete on command exit

                * <u>now</u>: delete and return immediately

       <b>ocmd=</b><u>&lt;cmds&gt;</u>
              Specifies processing to be performed on the output table, after all  other  processing  has  taken
              place.  The value of this parameter is one or more of the filter commands described in SUN/256. If
              more than one is given, they must be separated by semicolon characters (";"). This  parameter  can
              be  repeated  multiple  times on the same command line to build up a list of processing steps. The
              sequence of commands given in this way defines the processing pipeline which is performed  on  the
              table.

              Commands  may  alternatively  be  supplied in an external file, by using the indirection character
              '<u>@</u>'. Thus a value of "<u>@filename</u>" causes the file <u>filename</u> to be read for a list of filter commands
              to execute. The commands in the file may be separated by newline characters and/or semicolons, and
              lines which are blank or which start with a '<u>#</u>' character are ignored. A backslash character '<u>\fR'</u>
              <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>end</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>line</u> <u>joins</u> <u>it</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>following</u> <u>line.</u>

       <b>omode=</b><u>out|meta|stats|count|checksum|cgi|discard|topcat|samp|tosql|gui</u>
              The mode in which the result table will be output. The default mode is <u>out</u>, which means  that  the
              result  will be written as a new table to disk or elsewhere, as determined by the <u>out</u> and <u>ofmt</u> pa‐
              rameters. However, there are other possibilities, which correspond to uses to which a table can be
              put other than outputting it, such as displaying metadata, calculating statistics, or populating a
              table in an SQL database. For some values of this parameter, additional  parameters  (<u>&lt;mode-args&gt;</u>)
              are required to determine the exact behaviour.

              Possible values are

                * <u>out</u>

                * <u>meta</u>

                * <u>stats</u>

                * <u>count</u>

                * <u>checksum</u>

                * <u>cgi</u>

                * <u>discard</u>

                * <u>topcat</u>

                * <u>samp</u>

                * <u>tosql</u>

                * <u>gui</u>
               Use the <u>help=omode</u> flag or see SUN/256 for more information.

       <b>out=</b><u>&lt;out-table&gt;</u>
              The  location  of  the output table. This is usually a filename to write to. If it is equal to the
              special value "-" (the default) the output table will be written to standard output.

              This parameter must only be given if <u>omode</u> has its default value of "<u>out</u>".

       <b>ofmt=</b><u>&lt;out-format&gt;</u>
              Specifies the format in which the output table will be written (one  of  the  ones  in  SUN/256  -
              matching  is  case-insensitive  and you can use just the first few letters). If it has the special
              value "<u>(auto)</u>" (the default), then the output filename will be examined to try to guess what  sort
              of  file  is  required  usually by looking at the extension. If it's not obvious from the filename
              what output format is intended, an error will result.

              This parameter must only be given if <u>omode</u> has its default value of "<u>out</u>".
