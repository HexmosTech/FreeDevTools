       stilts-tpipe - Performs pipeline processing on a table

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>stilts</b> <b>tpipe</b> [ifmt=<u>&lt;in-format&gt;</u>] [istream=<u>true|false</u>] [in=<u>&lt;table&gt;</u>] [cmd=<u>&lt;cmds&gt;</u>]
                    [omode=<u>out|meta|stats|count|checksum|cgi|discard|topcat|samp|tosql|gui</u>] [out=<u>&lt;out-table&gt;</u>]
                    [ofmt=<u>&lt;out-format&gt;</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>tpipe</u>  performs all kinds of general purpose manipulations which take one table as input. It is extremely
       flexible, and can do the following things amongst others:

         * calculate statistics

         * display metadata

         * select rows in various ways, including algebraically

         * define new columns as algebraic functions of old ones

         * delete or rearrange columns

         * sort rows

         * convert between table formats
        and combine these operations. You can think of it as a supercharged table copying tool.

       The basic operation of <u>tpipe</u> is that it reads an input table, performs zero or more processing  steps  on
       it, and then does something with the output. There are therefore three classes of things you need to tell
       it when it runs:

       Input table location Specified by the <u>in</u>, <u>ifmt</u> and <u>istream</u> parameters.

       Processing steps Either provide a string giving steps as the value of one or more <u>cmd</u> parameters, or the
       name of a file containing the steps using the <u>script</u> parameter. The steps that you can perform are de‐
       scribed in SUN/256.

       Output table destination What happens to the output table is determined by the value of the <u>omode</u> parame‐
       ter. By default, <u>omode=out</u>, in which case the table is written to a new table file in a format determined
       by <u>ofmt</u>. However, you can do other things with the result such as calculate the per-column statistics
       (<u>omode=stats</u>), view only the table and column metadata (<u>omode=meta</u>), display it directly in TOPCAT
       (<u>omode=topcat</u>) etc. See SUN/256 for a more detailed explanation of these ideas.

       The parameters mentioned above are listed in detail in the next section.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ifmt=</b><u>&lt;in-format&gt;</u>
              Specifies the format of the input table as specified by parameter <u>in</u>. The known formats are listed
              in  SUN/256. This flag can be used if you know what format your table is in. If it has the special
              value <u>(auto)</u> (the default), then an attempt will be made to detect the format of the  table  auto‐
              matically.  This cannot always be done correctly however, in which case the program will exit with
              an error explaining which formats were attempted. This parameter is ignored  for  scheme-specified
              tables.

       <b>istream=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If  set true, the input table specified by the <u>in</u> parameter will be read as a stream. It is neces‐
              sary to give the <u>ifmt</u> parameter in this case. Depending on the required operations and  processing
              mode,  this  may  cause  the  read  to fail (sometimes it is necessary to read the table more than
              once). It is not normally necessary to set this flag; in most cases the data will be streamed  au‐
              tomatically  if that is the best thing to do. However it can sometimes result in less resource us‐
              age when processing large files in certain formats (such as VOTable). This  parameter  is  ignored
              for scheme-specified tables.

       <b>in=</b><u>&lt;table&gt;</u>
              The location of the input table. This may take one of the following forms:

                * A filename.

                * A URL.

                * The special value "<u>-</u>", meaning standard input. In this case the input format must be given ex‐
                  plicitly using the <u>ifmt</u> parameter. Note that not all formats can be streamed in this way.

                * A scheme specification of the form <u>:&lt;scheme-name&gt;:&lt;scheme-args&gt;</u>.

                * A  system command line with either a "<u>&lt;</u>" character at the start, or a "<u>|</u>" character at the end
                  ("<u>&lt;syscmd</u>" or "<u>syscmd|</u>"). This executes the given pipeline and reads from its standard output.
                  This will probably only work on unix-like systems.
               In any case, compressed data in one of the supported compression formats (gzip, Unix compress  or
              bzip2) will be decompressed transparently.

       <b>cmd=</b><u>&lt;cmds&gt;</u>
              Specifies  processing  to be performed on the input table as specified by parameter <u>in</u>, before any
              other processing has taken place. The value of this parameter is one or more of  the  filter  com‐
              mands described in SUN/256. If more than one is given, they must be separated by semicolon charac‐
              ters  (";").  This parameter can be repeated multiple times on the same command line to build up a
              list of processing steps. The sequence of commands  given  in  this  way  defines  the  processing
              pipeline which is performed on the table.

              Commands  may  alternatively  be  supplied in an external file, by using the indirection character
              '<u>@</u>'. Thus a value of "<u>@filename</u>" causes the file <u>filename</u> to be read for a list of filter commands
              to execute. The commands in the file may be separated by newline characters and/or semicolons, and
              lines which are blank or which start with a '<u>#</u>' character are ignored. A backslash character '<u>\fR'</u>
              <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>end</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>line</u> <u>joins</u> <u>it</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>following</u> <u>line.</u>

       <b>omode=</b><u>out|meta|stats|count|checksum|cgi|discard|topcat|samp|tosql|gui</u>
              The mode in which the result table will be output. The default mode is <u>out</u>, which means  that  the
              result  will be written as a new table to disk or elsewhere, as determined by the <u>out</u> and <u>ofmt</u> pa‐
              rameters. However, there are other possibilities, which correspond to uses to which a table can be
              put other than outputting it, such as displaying metadata, calculating statistics, or populating a
              table in an SQL database. For some values of this parameter, additional  parameters  (<u>&lt;mode-args&gt;</u>)
              are required to determine the exact behaviour.

              Possible values are

                * <u>out</u>

                * <u>meta</u>

                * <u>stats</u>

                * <u>count</u>

                * <u>checksum</u>

                * <u>cgi</u>

                * <u>discard</u>

                * <u>topcat</u>

                * <u>samp</u>

                * <u>tosql</u>

                * <u>gui</u>
               Use the <u>help=omode</u> flag or see SUN/256 for more information.

       <b>out=</b><u>&lt;out-table&gt;</u>
              The  location  of  the output table. This is usually a filename to write to. If it is equal to the
              special value "-" (the default) the output table will be written to standard output.

              This parameter must only be given if <u>omode</u> has its default value of "<u>out</u>".

       <b>ofmt=</b><u>&lt;out-format&gt;</u>
              Specifies the format in which the output table will be written (one  of  the  ones  in  SUN/256  -
              matching  is  case-insensitive  and you can use just the first few letters). If it has the special
              value "<u>(auto)</u>" (the default), then the output filename will be examined to try to guess what  sort
              of  file  is  required  usually by looking at the extension. If it's not obvious from the filename
              what output format is intended, an error will result.

              This parameter must only be given if <u>omode</u> has its default value of "<u>out</u>".
