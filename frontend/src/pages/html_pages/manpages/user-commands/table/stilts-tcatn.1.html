       stilts-tcatn - Concatenates multiple tables

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>stilts</b> <b>tcatn</b> [nin=<u>&lt;count&gt;</u>] [ifmtN=<u>&lt;in-format&gt;</u>] [inN=<u>&lt;tableN&gt;</u>] [icmdN=<u>&lt;cmds&gt;</u>] [ocmd=<u>&lt;cmds&gt;</u>]

                    [countrows=<u>true|false</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>tcatn</u>  is  a tool for concatenating a number of tables one after the other. Each table can be manipulated
       separately prior to the concatenatation. If you have two tables T1 and T2 which contain similar  columns,
       and  you  want  to  treat them as a single table, you can use <u>tcatn</u> to produce a new table whose metadata
       (row headings etc) comes from T1 and whose data consists of all the rows of T1 followed by all  the  rows
       of T2.

       For  this concatenation to make sense, each column of T1 must be compatible with the corresponding column
       of T2 - they must have compatible types and, presumably, meanings. If this is not the case for the tables
       that you wish to concatenate, for instance the columns are in different orders, or the units  differ  be‐
       tween  a column in T1 and its opposite number in T2, you can use the <u>icmd1</u> and/or <u>icmd2</u> parameters to ma‐
       nipulate the input tables so that the column sequences are compatible. See SUN/256 for some examples.

       If the tables are similar to each other (same format, same columns, same preprocessing stages required if
       any), you may find it easier to use <u>tcat</u> instead.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nin=</b><u>&lt;count&gt;</u>
              The number of input tables for this task. For each of the input tables N there will be  associated
              parameters <u>ifmtN</u>, <u>inN</u> and <u>icmdN</u>.

       <b>ifmtN=</b><u>&lt;in-format&gt;</u>
              Specifies the format of input table #N as specified by parameter <u>inN</u>. The known formats are listed
              in  SUN/256. This flag can be used if you know what format your table is in. If it has the special
              value <u>(auto)</u> (the default), then an attempt will be made to detect the format of the  table  auto‐
              matically.  This cannot always be done correctly however, in which case the program will exit with
              an error explaining which formats were attempted. This parameter is ignored  for  scheme-specified
              tables.

       <b>inN=</b><u>&lt;tableN&gt;</u>
              The location of input table #N. This may take one of the following forms:

                * A filename.

                * A URL.

                * The special value "<u>-</u>", meaning standard input. In this case the input format must be given ex‐
                  plicitly using the <u>ifmtN</u> parameter. Note that not all formats can be streamed in this way.

                * A scheme specification of the form <u>:&lt;scheme-name&gt;:&lt;scheme-args&gt;</u>.

                * A  system command line with either a "<u>&lt;</u>" character at the start, or a "<u>|</u>" character at the end
                  ("<u>&lt;syscmd</u>" or "<u>syscmd|</u>"). This executes the given pipeline and reads from its standard output.
                  This will probably only work on unix-like systems.
               In any case, compressed data in one of the supported compression formats (gzip, Unix compress  or
              bzip2) will be decompressed transparently.

       <b>icmdN=</b><u>&lt;cmds&gt;</u>
              Specifies  processing  to be performed on input table #N as specified by parameter <u>inN</u>, before any
              other processing has taken place. The value of this parameter is one or more of  the  filter  com‐
              mands described in SUN/256. If more than one is given, they must be separated by semicolon charac‐
              ters  (";").  This parameter can be repeated multiple times on the same command line to build up a
              list of processing steps. The sequence of commands  given  in  this  way  defines  the  processing
              pipeline which is performed on the table.

              Commands  may  alternatively  be  supplied in an external file, by using the indirection character
              '<u>@</u>'. Thus a value of "<u>@filename</u>" causes the file <u>filename</u> to be read for a list of filter commands
              to execute. The commands in the file may be separated by newline characters and/or semicolons, and
              lines which are blank or which start with a '<u>#</u>' character are ignored. A backslash character '<u>\fR'</u>
              <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>end</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>line</u> <u>joins</u> <u>it</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>following</u> <u>line.</u>

       <b>ocmd=</b><u>&lt;cmds&gt;</u>
              Specifies processing to be performed on the output table, after all  other  processing  has  taken
              place.  The value of this parameter is one or more of the filter commands described in SUN/256. If
              more than one is given, they must be separated by semicolon characters (";"). This  parameter  can
              be  repeated  multiple  times on the same command line to build up a list of processing steps. The
              sequence of commands given in this way defines the processing pipeline which is performed  on  the
              table.

              Commands  may  alternatively  be  supplied in an external file, by using the indirection character
              '<u>@</u>'. Thus a value of "<u>@filename</u>" causes the file <u>filename</u> to be read for a list of filter commands
              to execute. The commands in the file may be separated by newline characters and/or semicolons, and
              lines which are blank or which start with a '<u>#</u>' character are ignored. A backslash character '<u>\fR'</u>
              <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>end</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>line</u> <u>joins</u> <u>it</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>following</u> <u>line.</u>

       <b>omode=</b><u>out|meta|stats|count|checksum|cgi|discard|topcat|samp|tosql|gui</u>
              The mode in which the result table will be output. The default mode is <u>out</u>, which means  that  the
              result  will be written as a new table to disk or elsewhere, as determined by the <u>out</u> and <u>ofmt</u> pa‐
              rameters. However, there are other possibilities, which correspond to uses to which a table can be
              put other than outputting it, such as displaying metadata, calculating statistics, or populating a
              table in an SQL database. For some values of this parameter, additional  parameters  (<u>&lt;mode-args&gt;</u>)
              are required to determine the exact behaviour.

              Possible values are

                * <u>out</u>

                * <u>meta</u>

                * <u>stats</u>

                * <u>count</u>

                * <u>checksum</u>

                * <u>cgi</u>

                * <u>discard</u>

                * <u>topcat</u>

                * <u>samp</u>

                * <u>tosql</u>

                * <u>gui</u>
               Use the <u>help=omode</u> flag or see SUN/256 for more information.

       <b>out=</b><u>&lt;out-table&gt;</u>
              The  location  of  the output table. This is usually a filename to write to. If it is equal to the
              special value "-" (the default) the output table will be written to standard output.

              This parameter must only be given if <u>omode</u> has its default value of "<u>out</u>".

       <b>ofmt=</b><u>&lt;out-format&gt;</u>
              Specifies the format in which the output table will be written (one  of  the  ones  in  SUN/256  -
              matching  is  case-insensitive  and you can use just the first few letters). If it has the special
              value "<u>(auto)</u>" (the default), then the output filename will be examined to try to guess what  sort
              of  file  is  required  usually by looking at the extension. If it's not obvious from the filename
              what output format is intended, an error will result.

              This parameter must only be given if <u>omode</u> has its default value of "<u>out</u>".

       <b>seqcol=</b><u>&lt;colname&gt;</u>
              Name of a column to be added to the output table which will contain the sequence number of the in‐
              put table from which each row originated. This column will contain 1 for the rows from  the  first
              concatenated table, 2 for the second, and so on.

       <b>loccol=</b><u>&lt;colname&gt;</u>
              Name  of a column to be added to the output table which will contain the location (as specified in
              the input parameter(s)) of the input table from which each row originated.

       <b>uloccol=</b><u>&lt;colname&gt;</u>
              Name of a column to be added to the output table which will contain the unique part of  the  loca‐
              tion  (as  specified in the input parameter(s)) of the input table from which each row originated.
              If not null, parameters will also be added to the output table giving the pre- and post-fix string
              common to all the locations. For example, if the input tables are  "/data/cat_a1.fits"  and  "/da‐
              ta/cat_b2.fits"  then  the  output table will contain a new column &lt;colname&gt; which takes the value
              "a1" for rows from the first table and "b2" for rows from the second, and  new  parameters  "&lt;col‐
              name&gt;_prefix" and "&lt;colname&gt;_postfix" with the values "/data/cat_" and ".fits" respectively.

       <b>countrows=</b><u>true|false</u>
              Whether  to  count  the rows in the table before starting the output. This is essentially a tuning
              parameter - if writing to an output format which requires the number of rows  up  front  (such  as
              normal  FITS)  it may result in skipping the number of passes through the input files required for
              processing. Unless you have a good understanding of the internals of the software, your  best  bet
              for working out whether to set this true or false is to try it both ways
