       stilts-tmulti - Writes multiple tables to a single container file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>stilts</b> <b>tmulti</b> [in=<u>&lt;table&gt;</u> <u>[&lt;table&gt;</u> <u>...]</u>] [ifmt=<u>&lt;in-format&gt;</u>] [multi=<u>true|false</u>] [istream=<u>true|false</u>]
                     [icmd=<u>&lt;cmds&gt;</u>] [out=<u>&lt;out-file&gt;</u>] [ofmt=<u>&lt;out-format&gt;</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>tmulti</u>  takes multiple input tables and writes them as separate tables to a single output container file.
       The container file must be of some format which can contain more than one table, for instance a FITS file
       (which can contain multiple extensions) or a VOTable document (which  can  contain  multiple  TABLE  ele‐
       ments).  Filtering may be performed on the tables prior to writing them. It is not necessary that all the
       tables are similar (e.g. that they all have the same type and number of columns), but the same processing
       commands will be applied to all of them. For more individual control, use the <u>tmultin</u> task.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>in=</b><u>&lt;table&gt;</u> <u>[&lt;table&gt;</u> <u>...]</u>
              Locations of the input tables. Either specify the parameter multiple times, or  supply  the  input
              tables as a space-separated list within a single use.

              The following table location forms are allowed:

                * A filename.

                * A URL.

                * The special value "<u>-</u>", meaning standard input. In this case the input format must be given ex‐
                  plicitly using the <u>ifmt</u> parameter. Note that not all formats can be streamed in this way.

                * A scheme specification of the form <u>:&lt;scheme-name&gt;:&lt;scheme-args&gt;</u>.

                * A  system command line with either a "<u>&lt;</u>" character at the start, or a "<u>|</u>" character at the end
                  ("<u>&lt;syscmd</u>" or "<u>syscmd|</u>"). This executes the given pipeline and reads from its standard output.
                  This will probably only work on unix-like systems.
               Compression in any of the supported compression formats (Unix compress, gzip or bzip2) is expand‐
              ed automatically.

              A list of input table locations may be given in an external file by using the indirction character
              '@'. Thus "<u>in=@filename</u>" causes the file <u>filename</u> to be read for a list of input table  locations.
              The locations in the file should each be on a separate line.

       <b>ifmt=</b><u>&lt;in-format&gt;</u>
              Specifies the format of the input table as specified by parameter <u>in</u>. The known formats are listed
              in  SUN/256. This flag can be used if you know what format your table is in. If it has the special
              value <u>(auto)</u> (the default), then an attempt will be made to detect the format of the  table  auto‐
              matically.  This cannot always be done correctly however, in which case the program will exit with
              an error explaining which formats were attempted. This parameter is ignored  for  scheme-specified
              tables.

              The same format parameter applies to all the tables specified by <u>in</u>.

       <b>multi=</b><u>true|false</u>
              Determines  whether all tables, or just the first one, from input table files will be used. If set
              <u>false</u>, then just the first table from each file named by <u>in</u> will be used. If <u>true</u>, then all tables
              present in those input files will be used. This only has an effect for file formats which are  ca‐
              pable  of containing more than one table, which effectively means FITS and VOTable and their vari‐
              ants.

       <b>istream=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If set true, the input table specified by the <u>in</u> parameter will be read as a stream. It is  neces‐
              sary  to give the <u>ifmt</u> parameter in this case. Depending on the required operations and processing
              mode, this may cause the read to fail (sometimes it is necessary  to  read  the  table  more  than
              once).  It is not normally necessary to set this flag; in most cases the data will be streamed au‐
              tomatically if that is the best thing to do. However it can sometimes result in less resource  us‐
              age  when  processing  large files in certain formats (such as VOTable). This parameter is ignored
              for scheme-specified tables.

              The same streaming flag applies to all the tables specified by <u>in</u>.

       <b>icmd=</b><u>&lt;cmds&gt;</u>
              Specifies processing to be performed on each input table as specified by parameter <u>in</u>, before  any
              other  processing  has  taken place. The value of this parameter is one or more of the filter com‐
              mands described in SUN/256. If more than one is given, they must be separated by semicolon charac‐
              ters (";"). This parameter can be repeated multiple times on the same command line to build  up  a
              list  of  processing  steps.  The  sequence  of  commands given in this way defines the processing
              pipeline which is performed on the table.

              Commands may alternatively be supplied in an external file, by  using  the  indirection  character
              '<u>@</u>'. Thus a value of "<u>@filename</u>" causes the file <u>filename</u> to be read for a list of filter commands
              to execute. The commands in the file may be separated by newline characters and/or semicolons, and
              lines which are blank or which start with a '<u>#</u>' character are ignored. A backslash character '<u>\fR'</u>
              <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>end</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>line</u> <u>joins</u> <u>it</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>following</u> <u>line.</u>

       <b>out=</b><u>&lt;out-file&gt;</u>
              The  location  of  the  output file. This is usually a filename to write to. If it is equal to the
              special value "-" the output will be written to standard output.

       <b>ofmt=</b><u>&lt;out-format&gt;</u>
              Specifies the format in which the output tables will be written (one of  the  ones  in  SUN/256  -
              matching  is  case-insensitive  and you can use just the first few letters). If it has the special
              value "<u>(auto)</u>" (the default), then the output filename will be examined to try to guess what  sort
              of  file  is  required  usually by looking at the extension. If it's not obvious from the filename
              what output format is intended, an error will result.

              Not all output formats are capable of writing multiple tables; if you choose one that is  not,  an
              error will result.
