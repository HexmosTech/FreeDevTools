</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       db5.3_checkpoint - Periodically checkpoint transactions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>db5.3_checkpoint</b> [-1Vv] [-h home] [-k kbytes] [-L file] [-P password] [-p min]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  db5.3_checkpoint  utility is a daemon process that monitors the database log, and periodically calls
       DB_ENV-&gt;txn_checkpoint to checkpoint it.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-1</b>     Checkpoint the log once, regardless of whether or not there  has  been  activity  since  the  last
              checkpoint and then exit.

       <b>-h</b>     Specify  a  home directory for the database environment; by default, the current working directory
              is used.

       <b>-k</b>     Checkpoint the database at least as often as every <b>kbytes</b> of log file are written.

       <b>-L</b>     Log the execution of the db5.3_checkpoint utility to the specified file in the  following  format,
              where <u>###</u> is the process ID, and the date is the time the utility was started.

       db_checkpoint: ### Wed Jun 15 01:23:45 EDT 1995

               This file will be removed if the db5.3_checkpoint utility exits gracefully.

       <b>-P</b>      Specify  an  environment  password.  Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password strings as
               soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of vulnerability on systems  where  unprivileged
               users  can  see  command-line  arguments  or where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
               containing the command-line arguments.

       <b>-p</b>      Checkpoint the database at least every <b>min</b> minutes if there has been any activity since the  last
               checkpoint.

       <b>-V</b>      Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

       <b>-v</b>      Write the time of each checkpoint attempt to the standard output.

       At least one of the <b>-1</b>, <b>-k</b>, and <b>-p</b> options must be specified.

       The  db5.3_checkpoint  utility  uses  a  Berkeley  DB  environment  (as  described for the <b>-h</b> option, the
       environment variable <b>DB_HOME</b>, or because the utility was run in a  directory  containing  a  Berkeley  DB
       environment).   In  order  to  avoid  environment  corruption  when  using  a  Berkeley  DB  environment,
       db5.3_checkpoint should always be given the chance to detach from the environment  and  exit  gracefully.
       To  cause  db5.3_checkpoint  to  release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt
       signal (SIGINT).

       The db5.3_checkpoint utility does not attempt to create the Berkeley DB shared memory regions if they  do
       not  already exist.  The application that creates the region should be started first, and once the region
       is created, the db5.3_checkpoint utility should be started.

       The DB_ENV-&gt;txn_checkpoint method is the underlying method used by the db5.3_checkpoint utility. See  the
       db_checkpoint  utility  source  code  for  an  example of using DB_ENV-&gt;txn_checkpoint in a IEEE/ANSI Std
       1003.1 (POSIX) environment.

       The db5.3_checkpoint utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DB_HOME</b>
              If the <b>-h</b> option is not specified and the environment variable DB_HOME is set, it is used  as  the
              path of the database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.
