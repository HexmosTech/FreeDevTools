       unshare - run program in new namespaces

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>unshare</b> [options] [<u>program</u> [<u>arguments</u>]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>unshare</b> command creates new namespaces (as specified by the command-line options described below) and
       then executes the specified <u>program</u>. If <u>program</u> is not given, then "${SHELL}" is run (default: <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u>).

       By default, a new namespace persists only as long as it has member processes. A new namespace can be made
       persistent even when it has no member processes by bind mounting <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a><u>pid</u>/ns/<u>type</u> files to a filesystem
       path. A namespace that has been made persistent in this way can subsequently be entered with <b><a href="../man1/nsenter.1.html">nsenter</a></b>(1)
       even after the <u>program</u> terminates (except PID namespaces where a permanently running init process is
       required). Once a persistent namespace is no longer needed, it can be unpersisted by using <b><a href="../man8/umount.8.html">umount</a></b>(8) to
       remove the bind mount. See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section for more details.

       <b>unshare</b> since util-linux version 2.36 uses <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>[pid]/ns/pid_for_children</u> and
       <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>[pid]/ns/time_for_children</u> files for persistent PID and TIME namespaces. This change requires Linux
       kernel 4.17 or newer.

       The following types of namespaces can be created with <b>unshare</b>:

       <b>mount</b> <b>namespace</b>
           Mounting and unmounting filesystems will not affect the rest of the system, except for filesystems
           which are explicitly marked as shared (with <b>mount</b> <b>--make-shared</b>; see <u><a href="file:/proc/self/mountinfo">/proc/self/mountinfo</a></u> or <b>findmnt</b>
           <b>-o+PROPAGATION</b> for the <b>shared</b> flags). For further details, see <b><a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces</a></b>(7).

           <b>unshare</b> since util-linux version 2.27 automatically sets propagation to <b>private</b> in a new mount
           namespace to make sure that the new namespace is really unshared. It’s possible to disable this
           feature with option <b>--propagation</b> <b>unchanged</b>. Note that <b>private</b> is the kernel default.

       <b>UTS</b> <b>namespace</b>
           Setting hostname or domainname will not affect the rest of the system. For further details, see
           <b><a href="../man7/uts_namespaces.7.html">uts_namespaces</a></b>(7).

       <b>IPC</b> <b>namespace</b>
           The process will have an independent namespace for POSIX message queues as well as System V message
           queues, semaphore sets and shared memory segments. For further details, see <b><a href="../man7/ipc_namespaces.7.html">ipc_namespaces</a></b>(7).

       <b>network</b> <b>namespace</b>
           The process will have independent IPv4 and IPv6 stacks, IP routing tables, firewall rules, the
           <u><a href="file:/proc/net">/proc/net</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/sys/class/net">/sys/class/net</a></u> directory trees, sockets, etc. For further details, see
           <b><a href="../man7/network_namespaces.7.html">network_namespaces</a></b>(7).

       <b>PID</b> <b>namespace</b>
           Children will have a distinct set of PID-to-process mappings from their parent. For further details,
           see <b><a href="../man7/pid_namespaces.7.html">pid_namespaces</a></b>(7).

       <b>cgroup</b> <b>namespace</b>
           The process will have a virtualized view of <u><a href="file:/proc/self/cgroup">/proc/self/cgroup</a></u>, and new cgroup mounts will be rooted
           at the namespace cgroup root. For further details, see <b><a href="../man7/cgroup_namespaces.7.html">cgroup_namespaces</a></b>(7).

       <b>user</b> <b>namespace</b>
           The process will have a distinct set of UIDs, GIDs and capabilities. For further details, see
           <b><a href="../man7/user_namespaces.7.html">user_namespaces</a></b>(7).

       <b>time</b> <b>namespace</b>
           The process can have a distinct view of <b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</b> and/or <b>CLOCK_BOOTTIME</b> which can be changed
           using <u><a href="file:/proc/self/timens_offsets">/proc/self/timens_offsets</a></u>. For further details, see <b><a href="../man7/time_namespaces.7.html">time_namespaces</a></b>(7).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-i</b>, <b>--ipc</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
           Create a new IPC namespace. If <u>file</u> is specified, then the namespace is made persistent by creating a
           bind mount at <u>file</u>.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mount</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
           Create a new mount namespace. If <u>file</u> is specified, then the namespace is made persistent by creating
           a bind mount at <u>file</u>. Note that <u>file</u> must be located on a mount whose propagation type is not <b>shared</b>
           (or an error results). Use the command <b>findmnt</b> <b>-o+PROPAGATION</b> when not sure about the current
           setting. See also the examples below.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--net</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
           Create a new network namespace. If <u>file</u> is specified, then the namespace is made persistent by
           creating a bind mount at <u>file</u>.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pid</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
           Create a new PID namespace. If <u>file</u> is specified, then the namespace is made persistent by creating a
           bind mount at <u>file</u>. (Creation of a persistent PID namespace will fail if the <b>--fork</b> option is not
           also specified.)

           See also the <b>--fork</b> and <b>--mount-proc</b> options.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--uts</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
           Create a new UTS namespace. If <u>file</u> is specified, then the namespace is made persistent by creating a
           bind mount at <u>file</u>.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--user</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
           Create a new user namespace. If <u>file</u> is specified, then the namespace is made persistent by creating
           a bind mount at <u>file</u>.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--cgroup</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
           Create a new cgroup namespace. If <u>file</u> is specified, then the namespace is made persistent by
           creating a bind mount at <u>file</u>.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--time</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
           Create a new time namespace. If <u>file</u> is specified, then the namespace is made persistent by creating
           a bind mount at <u>file</u>. The <b>--monotonic</b> and <b>--boottime</b> options can be used to specify the corresponding
           offset in the time namespace.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--fork</b>
           Fork the specified <u>program</u> as a child process of <b>unshare</b> rather than running it directly. This is
           useful when creating a new PID namespace. Note that when <b>unshare</b> is waiting for the child process,
           then it ignores <b>SIGINT</b> and <b>SIGTERM</b> and does not forward any signals to the child. It is necessary to
           send signals to the child process.

       <b>--keep-caps</b>
           When the <b>--user</b> option is given, ensure that capabilities granted in the user namespace are preserved
           in the child process.

       <b>--kill-child</b>[<b>=</b><u>signame</u>]
           When <b>unshare</b> terminates, have <u>signame</u> be sent to the forked child process. Combined with <b>--pid</b> this
           allows for an easy and reliable killing of the entire process tree below <b>unshare</b>. If not given,
           <u>signame</u> defaults to <b>SIGKILL</b>. This option implies <b>--fork</b>.

       <b>--mount-proc</b>[<b>=</b><u>mountpoint</u>]
           Just before running the program, mount the proc filesystem at <u>mountpoint</u> (default is <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u>). This is
           useful when creating a new PID namespace. It also implies creating a new mount namespace since the
           <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u> mount would otherwise mess up existing programs on the system. The new proc filesystem is
           explicitly mounted as private (with <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>|<b>MS_REC</b>).

       <b>--mount-binfmt</b>[<b>=</b><u>mountpoint</u>]
           Just before running the program, mount the binfmt_misc filesystem at <u>mountpoint</u> (default is
           <a href="file:/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc">/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc</a>). It also implies creating a new mount namespace since the binfmt_misc mount
           would otherwise mess up existing programs on the system. The new binfmt_misc filesystem is explicitly
           mounted as private (with <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>|<b>MS_REC</b>).

       <b>--map-user=</b><u>uid|name</u>
           Run the program only after the current effective user ID has been mapped to <u>uid</u>. If this option is
           specified multiple times, the last occurrence takes precedence. This option implies <b>--user</b>.

       <b>--map-users=</b><u>inneruid:outeruid:count</u>|<b>auto</b>|<b>all</b>
           Run the program only after the block of user IDs of size <u>count</u> beginning at <u>outeruid</u> has been mapped
           to the block of user IDs beginning at <u>inneruid</u>. This mapping is created with <b><a href="../man1/newuidmap.1.html">newuidmap</a></b>(1) if <b>unshare</b>
           was run unprivileged. If the range of user IDs overlaps with the mapping specified by <b>--map-user</b>,
           then a "hole" will be removed from the mapping. This may result in the highest user ID of the mapping
           not being mapped. Use <b>--map-users</b> multiple times to map more than one block of user IDs. The special
           value <b>auto</b> will map the first block of user IDs owned by the effective user from <u><a href="file:/etc/subuid">/etc/subuid</a></u> to a
           block starting at user ID 0. The special value <b>all</b> will create a pass-through map for every user ID
           available in the parent namespace. This option implies <b>--user</b>.

           Before util-linux version 2.39, this option expected a comma-separated argument of the form
           <u>outeruid,inneruid,count</u> but that format is now deprecated for consistency with the ordering used in
           <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>[pid]/uid_map</u> and the <u>X-mount.idmap</u> mount option.

       <b>--map-group=</b><u>gid|name</u>
           Run the program only after the current effective group ID has been mapped to <u>gid</u>. If this option is
           specified multiple times, the last occurrence takes precedence. This option implies <b>--setgroups=deny</b>
           and <b>--user</b>.

       <b>--map-groups=</b><u>innergid:outergid:count</u>|<b>auto</b>|<b>all</b>
           Run the program only after the block of group IDs of size <u>count</u> beginning at <u>outergid</u> has been mapped
           to the block of group IDs beginning at <u>innergid</u>. This mapping is created with <b><a href="../man1/newgidmap.1.html">newgidmap</a></b>(1) if <b>unshare</b>
           was run unprivileged. If the range of group IDs overlaps with the mapping specified by <b>--map-group</b>,
           then a "hole" will be removed from the mapping. This may result in the highest group ID of the
           mapping not being mapped. Use <b>--map-groups</b> multiple times to map more than one block of group IDs.
           The special value <b>auto</b> will map the first block of user IDs owned by the effective user from
           <u><a href="file:/etc/subgid">/etc/subgid</a></u> to a block starting at group ID 0. The special value <b>all</b> will create a pass-through map
           for every group ID available in the parent namespace. This option implies <b>--user</b>.

           Before util-linux version 2.39, this option expected a comma-separated argument of the form
           <u>outergid,innergid,count</u> but that format is now deprecated for consistency with the ordering used in
           <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>[pid]/gid_map</u> and the <u>X-mount.idmap</u> mount option.

       <b>--map-auto</b>
           Map the first block of user IDs owned by the effective user from <u><a href="file:/etc/subuid">/etc/subuid</a></u> to a block starting at
           user ID 0. In the same manner, also map the first block of group IDs owned by the effective group
           from <u><a href="file:/etc/subgid">/etc/subgid</a></u> to a block starting at group ID 0. This option is intended to handle the common case
           where the first block of subordinate user and group IDs can map the whole user and group ID space.
           This option is equivalent to specifying <b>--map-users=auto</b> and <b>--map-groups=auto</b>.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--map-root-user</b>
           Run the program only after the current effective user and group IDs have been mapped to the superuser
           UID and GID in the newly created user namespace. This makes it possible to conveniently gain
           capabilities needed to manage various aspects of the newly created namespaces (such as configuring
           interfaces in the network namespace or mounting filesystems in the mount namespace) even when run
           unprivileged. As a mere convenience feature, it does not support more sophisticated use cases, such
           as mapping multiple ranges of UIDs and GIDs. This option implies <b>--setgroups=deny</b> and <b>--user</b>. This
           option is equivalent to <b>--map-user=0</b> <b>--map-group=0</b>.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--map-current-user</b>
           Run the program only after the current effective user and group IDs have been mapped to the same UID
           and GID in the newly created user namespace. This option implies <b>--setgroups=deny</b> and <b>--user</b>. This
           option is equivalent to <b>--map-user=$(id</b> <b>-ru)</b> <b>--map-group=$(id</b> <b>-rg)</b>.

       <b>--propagation</b> <b>private</b>|<b>shared</b>|<b>slave</b>|<b>unchanged</b>
           Recursively set the mount propagation flag in the new mount namespace. The default is to set the
           propagation to <u>private</u>. It is possible to disable this feature with the argument <b>unchanged</b>. The
           option is silently ignored when the mount namespace (<b>--mount</b>) is not requested.

       <b>--setgroups</b> <b>allow</b>|<b>deny</b>
           Allow or deny the <b><a href="../man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups</a></b>(2) system call in a user namespace.

           To be able to call <b><a href="../man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups</a></b>(2), the calling process must at least have <b>CAP_SETGID</b>. But since Linux
           3.19 a further restriction applies: the kernel gives permission to call <b><a href="../man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups</a></b>(2) only after the
           GID map (<b><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></b><u>pid</u>*/gid_map*) has been set. The GID map is writable by root when <b><a href="../man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups</a></b>(2) is
           enabled (i.e., <b>allow</b>, the default), and the GID map becomes writable by unprivileged processes when
           <b><a href="../man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups</a></b>(2) is permanently disabled (with <b>deny</b>).

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--root=</b><u>dir</u>
           run the command with root directory set to <u>dir</u>.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--wd=</b><u>dir</u>
           change working directory to <u>dir</u>.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--setuid</b> <u>uid</u>
           Set the user ID which will be used in the entered namespace.

       <b>-G</b>, <b>--setgid</b> <u>gid</u>
           Set the group ID which will be used in the entered namespace and drop supplementary groups.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--load-interp=</b><u>string</u>
           Load binfmt_misc definition in the namespace (implies <b>--mount-binfmt</b>). The <u>string</u> argument is
           :name:type:offset:magic:mask:interpreter:flags. For more details about new binary type registration
           see  https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/binfmt-misc.rst. To manage the F flag in
           flags with <b>--root</b> parameter, binfmt_misc is mounted twice, once before the chroot to load the
           interpreter from the caller filesystem and once after to make it available from the chroot userspace.

       <b>--monotonic</b> <u>offset</u>
           Set the offset of <b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</b> which will be used in the entered time namespace. This option
           requires unsharing a time namespace with <b>--time</b>.

       <b>--boottime</b> <u>offset</u>
           Set the offset of <b>CLOCK_BOOTTIME</b> which will be used in the entered time namespace. This option
           requires unsharing a time namespace with <b>--time</b>.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help text and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Print version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The proc and sysfs filesystems mounting as root in a user namespace have to be restricted so that a less
       privileged user cannot get more access to sensitive files that a more privileged user made unavailable.
       In short the rule for proc and sysfs is as close to a bind mount as possible.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following command creates a PID namespace, using <b>--fork</b> to ensure that the executed command is
       performed in a child process that (being the first process in the namespace) has PID 1. The <b>--mount-proc</b>
       option ensures that a new mount namespace is also simultaneously created and that a new <b><a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</a></b>(5)
       filesystem is mounted that contains information corresponding to the new PID namespace. When the
       <b><a href="../man1/readlink.1.html">readlink</a></b>(1) command terminates, the new namespaces are automatically torn down.

           # unshare --fork --pid --mount-proc readlink <a href="file:/proc/self">/proc/self</a>
           1

       As an unprivileged user, create a new user namespace where the user’s credentials are mapped to the root
       IDs inside the namespace:

           $ id -u; id -g
           1000
           1000
           $ unshare --user --map-root-user \
                   sh -c 'whoami; cat <a href="file:/proc/self/uid_map">/proc/self/uid_map</a> <a href="file:/proc/self/gid_map">/proc/self/gid_map</a>'
           root
                    0       1000          1
                    0       1000          1

       As an unprivileged user, create a user namespace where the first 65536 IDs are all mapped, and the user’s
       credentials are mapped to the root IDs inside the namespace. The map is determined by the subordinate IDs
       assigned in <b><a href="../man5/subuid.5.html">subuid</a></b>(5) and <b><a href="../man5/subgid.5.html">subgid</a></b>(5). Demonstrate this mapping by creating a file with user ID 1 and group
       ID 1. For brevity, only the user ID mappings are shown:

           $ id -u
           1000
           $ cat <a href="file:/etc/subuid">/etc/subuid</a>
           1000:100000:65536
           $ unshare --user --map-auto --map-root-user
           # id -u
           0
           # cat <a href="file:/proc/self/uid_map">/proc/self/uid_map</a>
                    0       1000          1
                    1     100000      65535
           # touch file; chown 1:1 file
           # ls -ln --time-style=+ file
           -rw-r--r-- 1 1 1 0  file
           # exit
           $ ls -ln --time-style=+ file
           -rw-r--r-- 1 100000 100000 0  file

       The first of the following commands creates a new persistent UTS namespace and modifies the hostname as
       seen in that namespace. The namespace is then entered with <b><a href="../man1/nsenter.1.html">nsenter</a></b>(1) in order to display the modified
       hostname; this step demonstrates that the UTS namespace continues to exist even though the namespace had
       no member processes after the <b>unshare</b> command terminated. The namespace is then destroyed by removing the
       bind mount.

           # touch /root/uts-ns
           # unshare --uts=/root/uts-ns hostname FOO
           # nsenter --uts=/root/uts-ns hostname
           FOO
           # umount /root/uts-ns

       The following commands establish a persistent mount namespace referenced by the bind mount
       <u>/root/namespaces/mnt</u>. In order to ensure that the creation of that bind mount succeeds, the parent
       directory (<u>/root/namespaces</u>) is made a bind mount whose propagation type is not <b>shared</b>.

           # mount --bind /root/namespaces /root/namespaces
           # mount --make-private /root/namespaces
           # touch /root/namespaces/mnt
           # unshare --mount=/root/namespaces/mnt

       The following commands demonstrate the use of the <b>--kill-child</b> option when creating a PID namespace, in
       order to ensure that when <b>unshare</b> is killed, all of the processes within the PID namespace are killed.

           # set +m                # Don't print job status messages

           # unshare --pid --fork --mount-proc --kill-child -- \
                  bash --norc -c '(sleep 555 &amp;) &amp;&amp; (ps a &amp;) &amp;&amp; sleep 999' &amp;
           [1] 53456
           #     PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
                 1 pts/3    S+     0:00 sleep 999
                 3 pts/3    S+     0:00 sleep 555
                 5 pts/3    R+     0:00 ps a

           # ps h -o 'comm' $!     # Show that background job is <a href="../man1/unshare.1.html">unshare</a>(1)
           unshare
           # kill $!               # Kill <a href="../man1/unshare.1.html">unshare</a>(1)
           # pidof sleep

       The <b><a href="../man1/pidof.1.html">pidof</a></b>(1) command prints no output, because the <b>sleep</b> processes have been killed. More precisely, when
       the <b>sleep</b> process that has PID 1 in the namespace (i.e., the namespace’s init process) was killed, this
       caused all other processes in the namespace to be killed. By contrast, a similar series of commands where
       the <b>--kill-child</b> option is not used shows that when <b>unshare</b> terminates, the processes in the PID
       namespace are not killed:

           # unshare --pid --fork --mount-proc -- \
                  bash --norc -c '(sleep 555 &amp;) &amp;&amp; (ps a &amp;) &amp;&amp; sleep 999' &amp;
           [1] 53479
           #     PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
                 1 pts/3    S+     0:00 sleep 999
                 3 pts/3    S+     0:00 sleep 555
                 5 pts/3    R+     0:00 ps a

           # kill $!
           # pidof sleep
           53482 53480

       The following example demonstrates the creation of a time namespace where the boottime clock is set to a
       point several years in the past:

           # uptime -p             # Show uptime in initial time namespace
           up 21 hours, 30 minutes
           # unshare --time --fork --boottime 300000000 uptime -p
           up 9 years, 28 weeks, 1 day, 2 hours, 50 minutes

       The following example execute a chroot into the directory /chroot/powerpc/jessie and install the
       interpreter /bin/qemu-ppc-static to execute the powerpc binaries.

           $  unshare --map-root-user --fork --pid --load-interp=":qemu-ppc:M::\\x7fELF\x01\\x02\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x02\\x00\\x14:\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\x00\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xfe\\xff\\xff:/bin/qemu-ppc-static:OCF" --root=/chroot/powerpc/jessie <a href="file:/bin/bash">/bin/bash</a> -l

       The load-interp parameter can be read as following

           qemu-ppc
               is the name of the new file created below <a href="file:/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc">/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc</a> to register the interpreter

           M
               defines the interpreter for a given type of magic number

           \\x7fELF\x01\\x02\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x02\\x00\\x1
               is the magic number to recognize the file to interpret (in this case, the ELF header for PPC32)

           \\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\x00\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xfe\\xff\\xff
               the mask to apply to the magic number

           /bin/qemu-ppc-static
               the interpreter to use with the file

           OCF
               the file is open by the kernel with credential and security tokens of the file itself and loaded
               as soon as we register it.
