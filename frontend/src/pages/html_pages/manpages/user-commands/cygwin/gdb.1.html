</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gdb - The GNU Debugger

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       gdb [OPTIONS] [<u>prog</u>|<u>prog</u> <u>procID</u>|<u>prog</u> <u>core</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what is going on "inside" another program
       while it executes -- or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed.

       GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of these) to help you catch bugs in
       the act:

       •   Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.

       •   Make your program stop on specified conditions.

       •   Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.

       •   Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on
           to learn about another.

       You can use GDB to debug programs written in C, C++, Fortran and Modula-2.

       GDB is invoked with the shell command "gdb".  Once started, it reads commands from the terminal until you
       tell  it to exit with the GDB command "quit" or "exit".  You can get online help from GDB itself by using
       the command "help".

       You can run "gdb" with no arguments or options; but the most usual way to start GDB is with one  argument
       or two, specifying an executable program as the argument:

               gdb program

       You can also start with both an executable program and a core file specified:

               gdb program core

       You  can,  instead,  specify a process ID as a second argument or use option "-p", if you want to debug a
       running process:

               gdb program 1234
               gdb -p 1234

       would attach GDB to process 1234.  With option <b>-p</b> you can omit the <u>program</u> filename.

       Here are some of the most frequently needed GDB commands:

       <b>break</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u><b>:][</b><u>function</u><b>|</b><u>line</u><b>]</b>
           Set a breakpoint at <u>function</u> or <u>line</u> (in <u>file</u>).

       <b>run</b> <b>[</b><u>arglist</u><b>]</b>
           Start your program (with <u>arglist</u>, if specified).

       <b>bt</b>  Backtrace: display the program stack.

       <b>print</b> <u>expr</u>
           Display the value of an expression.

       <b>c</b>   Continue running your program (after stopping, e.g. at a breakpoint).

       <b>next</b>
           Execute next program line (after stopping); step <u>over</u> any function calls in the line.

       <b>edit</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u><b>:]</b><u>function</u>
           look at the program line where it is presently stopped.

       <b>list</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u><b>:]</b><u>function</u>
           type the text of the program in the vicinity of where it is presently stopped.

       <b>step</b>
           Execute next program line (after stopping); step <u>into</u> any function calls in the line.

       <b>help</b> <b>[</b><u>name</u><b>]</b>
           Show information about GDB command <u>name</u>, or general information about using GDB.

       <b>quit</b>
       <b>exit</b>
           Exit from GDB.

       For full details on GDB, see <u>Using</u> <u>GDB:</u> <u>A</u> <u>Guide</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>GNU</u> <u>Source-Level</u> <u>Debugger</u>, by Richard M.  Stallman
       and Roland H. Pesch.  The same text is available online as the "gdb" entry in the "info" program.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Any  arguments  other than options specify an executable file and core file (or process ID); that is, the
       first argument encountered with no associated option flag is equivalent to a <b>--se</b> option, and the second,
       if any, is equivalent to a <b>-c</b> option if it's the name of  a  file.   Many  options  have  both  long  and
       abbreviated forms; both are shown here.  The long forms are also recognized if you truncate them, so long
       as enough of the option is present to be unambiguous.

       The  abbreviated  forms  are  shown  here with <b>-</b> and long forms are shown with <b>--</b> to reflect how they are
       shown in <b>--help</b>. However, GDB recognizes all of the following conventions for most options:

       "--option=<u>value</u>"
       "--option <u>value</u>"
       "-option=<u>value</u>"
       "-option <u>value</u>"
       "--o=<u>value</u>"
       "--o <u>value</u>"
       "-o=<u>value</u>"
       "-o <u>value</u>"

       All the options and command line arguments you give are processed in sequential order.  The order makes a
       difference when the <b>-x</b> option is used.

       <b>--help</b>
       <b>-h</b>  List all options, with brief explanations.

       <b>--symbols=</b><u>file</u>
       <b>-s</b> <u>file</u>
           Read symbol table from <u>file</u>.

       <b>--write</b>
           Enable writing into executable and core files.

       <b>--exec=</b><u>file</u>
       <b>-e</b> <u>file</u>
           Use <u>file</u> as the executable file  to  execute  when  appropriate,  and  for  examining  pure  data  in
           conjunction with a core dump.

       <b>--se=</b><u>file</u>
           Read symbol table from <u>file</u> and use it as the executable file.

       <b>--core=</b><u>file</u>
       <b>-c</b> <u>file</u>
           Use <u>file</u> as a core dump to examine.

       <b>--command=</b><u>file</u>
       <b>-x</b> <u>file</u>
           Execute GDB commands from <u>file</u>.

       <b>--eval-command=</b><u>command</u>
       <b>-ex</b> <u>command</u>
           Execute given GDB <u>command</u>.

       <b>--init-eval-command=</b><u>command</u>
       <b>-iex</b>
           Execute GDB <u>command</u> before loading the inferior.

       <b>--directory=</b><u>directory</u>
       <b>-d</b> <u>directory</u>
           Add <u>directory</u> to the path to search for source files.

       <b>--nh</b>
           Do  not  execute  commands  from  <u><a href="file:~/.config/gdb/gdbinit">~/.config/gdb/gdbinit</a></u>,  <u><a href="file:~/.gdbinit">~/.gdbinit</a></u>,  <u><a href="file:~/.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit">~/.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit</a></u>, or
           <u><a href="file:~/.gdbearlyinit">~/.gdbearlyinit</a></u>

       <b>--nx</b>
       <b>-n</b>  Do not execute commands from any <u>.gdbinit</u> or <u>.gdbearlyinit</u> initialization files.

       <b>--quiet</b>
       <b>--silent</b>
       <b>-q</b>  "Quiet".  Do not print the introductory and copyright messages.  These messages are  also  suppressed
           in batch mode.

       <b>--batch</b>
           Run  in batch mode.  Exit with status 0 after processing all the command files specified with <b>-x</b> (and
           <u>.gdbinit</u>, if not inhibited).  Exit with nonzero status if  an  error  occurs  in  executing  the  GDB
           commands in the command files.

           Batch  mode  may  be useful for running GDB as a filter, for example to download and run a program on
           another computer; in order to make this more useful, the message

                   Program exited normally.

           (which is ordinarily issued whenever a program running under GDB control terminates)  is  not  issued
           when running in batch mode.

       <b>--batch-silent</b>
           Run  in  batch  mode, just like <b>--batch</b>, but totally silent.  All GDB output is suppressed (stderr is
           unaffected).  This is much quieter than <b>--silent</b> and would be useless for an interactive session.

           This is particularly useful when using targets that give <b>Loading</b> <b>section</b> messages, for example.

           Note that targets that give their output via GDB, as opposed to writing directly  to  "stdout",  will
           also be made silent.

       <b>--args</b> <u>prog</u> <b>[</b><u>arglist</u><b>]</b>
           Change interpretation of command line so that arguments following this option are passed as arguments
           to the inferior.  As an example, take the following command:

                   gdb ./a.out -q

           It would start GDB with <b>-q</b>, not printing the introductory message.  On the other hand, using:

                   gdb --args ./a.out -q

           starts GDB with the introductory message, and passes the option to the inferior.

       <b>--pid=</b><u>pid</u>
           Attach GDB to an already running program, with the PID <u>pid</u>.

       <b>--tui</b>
           Open the terminal user interface.

       <b>--readnow</b>
           Read all symbols from the given symfile on the first access.

       <b>--readnever</b>
           Do not read symbol files.

       <b>--return-child-result</b>
           GDB's exit code will be the same as the child's exit code.

       <b>--configuration</b>
           Print details about GDB configuration and then exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print version information and then exit.

       <b>--cd=</b><u>directory</u>
           Run GDB using <u>directory</u> as its working directory, instead of the current directory.

       <b>--data-directory=</b><u>directory</u>
       <b>-D</b>  Run  GDB  using  <u>directory</u>  as  its data directory.  The data directory is where GDB searches for its
           auxiliary files.

       <b>--fullname</b>
       <b>-f</b>  Emacs sets this option when it runs GDB as a subprocess.  It tells GDB to output the full  file  name
           and  line  number  in  a  standard,  recognizable fashion each time a stack frame is displayed (which
           includes each time the program stops).  This recognizable format  looks  like  two  <b>\032</b>  characters,
           followed  by  the  file  name, line number and character position separated by colons, and a newline.
           The Emacs-to-GDB interface program uses the two <b>\032</b> characters as a signal  to  display  the  source
           code for the frame.

       <b>-b</b> <u>baudrate</u>
           Set  the  line  speed  (baud  rate or bits per second) of any serial interface used by GDB for remote
           debugging.

       <b>-l</b> <u>timeout</u>
           Set timeout, in seconds, for remote debugging.

       <b>--tty=</b><u>device</u>
           Run using <u>device</u> for your program's standard input and output.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The full documentation for GDB is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the "info" and "gdb"  programs  and
       GDB's Texinfo documentation are properly installed at your site, the command

               info gdb

       should give you access to the complete manual.
