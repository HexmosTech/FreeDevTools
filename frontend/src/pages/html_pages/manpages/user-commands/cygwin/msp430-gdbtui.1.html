       gdb - The GNU Debugger

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gdb</b>    [<b>-help</b>]  [<b>-nx</b>]  [<b>-q</b>] [<b>-batch</b>] [<b>-cd=</b><u>dir</u>] [<b>-f</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>bps</u>] [<b>-tty=</b><u>dev</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>symfile</u>] [<b>-e</b> <u>prog</u>] [<b>-se</b> <u>prog</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what is going on ``inside'' another  program
       while it executes—or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed.

       GDB  can  do  four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of these) to help you catch bugs in
       the act:

          •   Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.

          •   Make your program stop on specified conditions.

          •   Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.

          •   Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go
              on to learn about another.

       You can use GDB to debug programs written in C, C++, and Modula-2.  Fortran support will be added when  a
       GNU Fortran compiler is ready.

       GDB  is  invoked with the shell command <b>gdb</b>.  Once started, it reads commands from the terminal until you
       tell it to exit with the GDB command <b>quit</b>.  You can get online help from <b>gdb</b> itself by using the  command
       <b>help</b>.

       You can run <b>gdb</b> with no arguments or options; but the most usual way to start GDB is with one argument or
       two, specifying an executable program as the argument:

       gdb program

       You can also start with both an executable program and a core file specified:

       gdb program core

       You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument, if you want to debug a running process:

       gdb program 1234

       would  attach  GDB  to  process <b>1234</b> (unless you also have a file named `<b>1234</b>'; GDB does check for a core
       file first).

       Here are some of the most frequently needed GDB commands:

       <b>break</b> [<u>file</u><b>:</b>]<u>function</u>
               Set a breakpoint at <u>function</u> (in <u>file</u>).

       <b>run</b> [<u>arglist</u>]
              Start your program (with <u>arglist</u>, if specified).

       <b>bt</b>     Backtrace: display the program stack.

       <b>print</b> <u>expr</u>
              Display the value of an expression.

       <b>c</b>      Continue running your program (after stopping, e.g. at a breakpoint).

       <b>next</b>   Execute next program line (after stopping); step <u>over</u> any function calls in the line.

       <b>edit</b> [<u>file</u><b>:</b>]<u>function</u>
              look at the program line where it is presently stopped.

       <b>list</b> [<u>file</u><b>:</b>]<u>function</u>
              type the text of the program in the vicinity of where it is presently stopped.

       <b>step</b>   Execute next program line (after stopping); step <u>into</u> any function calls in the line.

       <b>help</b> [<u>name</u>]
              Show information about GDB command <u>name</u>, or general information about using GDB.

       <b>quit</b>   Exit from GDB.

       For full details on GDB, see <u>Using</u> <u>GDB:</u> <u>A</u> <u>Guide</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>GNU</u> <u>Source-Level</u> <u>Debugger</u>, by Richard M.  Stallman
       and Roland H. Pesch.  The same text is available online as the <b>gdb</b> entry in the <b>info</b> program.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Any  arguments  other than options specify an executable file and core file (or process ID); that is, the
       first argument encountered with no associated option flag is  equivalent  to  a  `<b>-se</b>'  option,  and  the
       second,  if  any, is equivalent to a `<b>-c</b>' option if it's the name of a file.  Many options have both long
       and short forms; both are shown here.  The long forms are also recognized if you truncate them,  so  long
       as enough of the option is present to be unambiguous.  (If you prefer, you can flag option arguments with
       `<b>+</b>' rather than `<b>-</b>', though we illustrate the more usual convention.)

       All the options and command line arguments you give are processed in sequential order.  The order makes a
       difference when the `<b>-x</b>' option is used.

       <b>-help</b>

       <b>-h</b>     List all options, with brief explanations.

       <b>-symbols=</b><u>file</u>

       <b>-s</b> <u>file</u>
              Read symbol table from file <u>file</u>.

       <b>-write</b> Enable writing into executable and core files.

       <b>-exec=</b><u>file</u>

       <b>-e</b> <u>file</u>
              Use  file  <u>file</u> as the executable file to execute when appropriate, and for examining pure data in
              conjunction with a core dump.

       <b>-se=</b><u>file</u>
              Read symbol table from file <u>file</u> and use it as the executable file.

       <b>-core=</b><u>file</u>

       <b>-c</b> <u>file</u>
              Use file <u>file</u> as a core dump to examine.

       <b>-command=</b><u>file</u>

       <b>-x</b> <u>file</u>
              Execute GDB commands from file <u>file</u>.

       <b>-directory=</b><u>directory</u>

       <b>-d</b> <u>directory</u>
              Add <u>directory</u> to the path to search for source files.

       <b>-nx</b>

       <b>-n</b>     Do not execute commands from any `<b>.gdbinit</b>' initialization files.  Normally, the commands in these
              files are executed after all the command options and arguments have been processed.

       <b>-quiet</b>

       <b>-q</b>     ``Quiet''.  Do not print the  introductory  and  copyright  messages.   These  messages  are  also
              suppressed in batch mode.

       <b>-batch</b> Run  in batch mode.  Exit with status <b>0</b> after processing all the command files specified with `<b>-x</b>'
              (and `<b>.gdbinit</b>', if not inhibited).  Exit with nonzero status if an error occurs in executing  the
              GDB commands in the command files.

              Batch mode may be useful for running GDB as a filter, for example to download and run a program on
              another computer; in order to make this more useful, the message

              Program exited normally.

              (which is ordinarily issued whenever a program running under GDB control terminates) is not issued
              when running in batch mode.

       <b>-cd=</b><u>directory</u>
              Run GDB using <u>directory</u> as its working directory, instead of the current directory.

       <b>-fullname</b>

       <b>-f</b>     Emacs  sets  this  option  when it runs GDB as a subprocess.  It tells GDB to output the full file
              name and line number in a standard, recognizable fashion each time  a  stack  frame  is  displayed
              (which  includes  each  time  the  program  stops).  This recognizable format looks like two ` <b>32</b>'
              characters, followed by the file name, line number and character position separated by colons, and
              a newline.  The Emacs-to-GDB interface program uses the  two  ` <b>32</b>'  characters  as  a  signal  to
              display the source code for the frame.

       <b>-b</b> <u>bps</u> Set  the  line speed (baud rate or bits per second) of any serial interface used by GDB for remote
              debugging.

       <b>-tty=</b><u>device</u>
              Run using <u>device</u> for your program's standard input and output.
