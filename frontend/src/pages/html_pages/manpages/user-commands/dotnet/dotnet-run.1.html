              dotnet run -h|--help

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>dotnet</b> <b>run</b> command provides a convenient option to run your application from the source code with one
       command.   It’s  useful for fast iterative development from the command line.  The command depends on the
       <b>dotnet</b> <b>build</b> command to build the code.  Any requirements for the build, such as that the project must be
       restored first, apply to <b>dotnet</b> <b>run</b> as well.

              <b>dotnet</b> <b>run</b> doesn’t respect arguments like <b>/property:property=value</b>, which are respected by  <b>dotnet</b>
              <b>build</b>.

       Output  files  are written into the default location, which is <b>bin/&lt;configuration&gt;/&lt;target&gt;</b>.  For example
       if you have a <b>netcoreapp2.1</b> application and you run <b>dotnet</b> <b>run</b>, the output is  placed  in  <b>bin/Debug/net‐</b>
       <b>coreapp2.1</b>.  Files are overwritten as needed.  Temporary files are placed in the <b>obj</b> directory.

       If  the  project  specifies  multiple  frameworks,  executing  <b>dotnet</b>  <b>run</b> results in an error unless the
       <b>-f|--framework</b> <b>&lt;FRAMEWORK&gt;</b> option is used to specify the framework.

       The <b>dotnet</b> <b>run</b> command is used in the context of projects, not built assemblies.  If you’re trying to run
       a framework-dependent application DLL instead, you must use dotnet without a command.   For  example,  to
       run <b>myapp.dll</b>, use:

              dotnet myapp.dll

       For more information on the <b>dotnet</b> driver, see the .NET Command Line Tools (CLI) topic.

       To run the application, the <b>dotnet</b> <b>run</b> command resolves the dependencies of the application that are out‐
       side  of  the  shared runtime from the NuGet cache.  Because it uses cached dependencies, it’s not recom‐
       mended to use <b>dotnet</b> <b>run</b> to run applications in production.  Instead, create a deployment using the  <b>dot‐</b>
       <b>net</b> <b>publish</b> command and deploy the published output.

   <b>Implicit</b> <b>restore</b>
       You  don’t  have to run <b>dotnet</b> <b>restore</b> because it’s run implicitly by all commands that require a restore
       to occur, such as <b>dotnet</b> <b>new</b>, <b>dotnet</b> <b>build</b>, <b>dotnet</b> <b>run</b>, <b>dotnet</b> <b>test</b>, <b>dotnet</b> <b>publish</b>, and <b>dotnet</b> <b>pack</b>.  To
       disable implicit restore, use the <b>--no-restore</b> option.

       The <b>dotnet</b> <b>restore</b> command is still useful in certain scenarios where explicitly restoring  makes  sense,
       such as continuous integration builds in Azure DevOps Services or in build systems that need to explicit‐
       ly control when the restore occurs.

       For information about how to manage NuGet feeds, see the <b>dotnet</b> <b>restore</b> documentation.

       This  command  supports  the <b>dotnet</b> <b>restore</b> options when passed in the long form (for example, <b>--source</b>).
       Short form options, such as <b>-s</b>, are not supported.

   <b>Workload</b> <b>manifest</b> <b>downloads</b>
       When you run this command, it initiates an asynchronous background download of advertising manifests  for
       workloads.   If  the  download is still running when this command finishes, the download is stopped.  For
       more information, see Advertising manifests.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       • <b>--</b>

         Delimits arguments to <b>dotnet</b> <b>run</b> from arguments for the application being  run.   All  arguments  after
         this delimiter are passed to the application run.

       • <b>-a|--arch</b> <b>&lt;ARCHITECTURE&gt;</b>

         Specifies  the  target  architecture.   This  is  a shorthand syntax for setting the Runtime Identifier
         (RID), where the provided value is combined with the default RID.  For example, on a  <b>win-x64</b>  machine,
         specifying  <b>--arch</b> <b>x86</b> sets the RID to <b>win-x86</b>.  If you use this option, don’t use the <b>-r|--runtime</b> op‐
         tion.  Available since .NET 6 Preview 7.

       • <b>-c|--configuration</b> <b>&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt;</b>

         Defines the build configuration.  The default for most projects is <b>Debug</b>,  but  you  can  override  the
         build configuration settings in your project.

       • <b>-f|--framework</b> <b>&lt;FRAMEWORK&gt;</b>

         Builds  and runs the app using the specified framework.  The framework must be specified in the project
         file.

       • <b>--force</b>

         Forces all dependencies to be resolved even if the last restore was successful.  Specifying  this  flag
         is the same as deleting the <u>project.assets.json</u> file.

       • <b>-?|-h|--help</b>

         Prints out a description of how to use the command.

       • <b>--interactive</b>

         Allows the command to stop and wait for user input or action.  For example, to complete authentication.
         Available since .NET Core 3.0 SDK.

       • <b>--launch-profile</b> <b>&lt;NAME&gt;</b>

         The name of the launch profile (if any) to use when launching the application.  Launch profiles are de‐
         fined  in  the  <u>launchSettings.json</u> file and are typically called <b>Development</b>, <b>Staging</b>, and <b>Production</b>.
         For more information, see Working with multiple environments.

       • <b>--no-build</b>

         Doesn’t build the project before running.  It also implicitly sets the <b>--no-restore</b> flag.

       • <b>--no-dependencies</b>

         When restoring a project with project-to-project (P2P) references, restores the root  project  and  not
         the references.

       • <b>--no-launch-profile</b>

         Doesn’t try to use <u>launchSettings.json</u> to configure the application.

       • <b>--no-restore</b>

         Doesn’t execute an implicit restore when running the command.

       • <b>--os</b> <b>&lt;OS&gt;</b>

         Specifies the target operating system (OS).  This is a shorthand syntax for setting the Runtime Identi‐
         fier  (RID),  where the provided value is combined with the default RID.  For example, on a <b>win-x64</b> ma‐
         chine, specifying <b>--os</b> <b>linux</b> sets the RID to  <b>linux-x64</b>.   If  you  use  this  option,  don’t  use  the
         <b>-r|--runtime</b> option.  Available since .NET 6.

       • <b>--project</b> <b>&lt;PATH&gt;</b>

         Specifies  the  path  of  the project file to run (folder name or full path).  If not specified, it de‐
         faults to the current directory.

         The <b>-p</b> abbreviation for <b>--project</b> is deprecated starting in .NET 6 SDK.  For a limited time starting in
         .NET 6 RC1 SDK, <b>-p</b> can still be used for <b>--project</b> despite the deprecation warning.   If  the  argument
         provided  for  the option doesn’t contain <b>=</b>, the command accepts <b>-p</b> as short for <b>--project</b>.  Otherwise,
         the command assumes that <b>-p</b> is short for <b>--property</b>.  This flexible use of <b>-p</b>  for  <b>--project</b>  will  be
         phased out in .NET 7.

       • <b>--property:&lt;NAME&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;</b>

         Sets one or more MSBuild properties.  Specify multiple properties delimited by semicolons or by repeat‐
         ing the option:

                --property:&lt;NAME1&gt;=&lt;VALUE1&gt;;&lt;NAME2&gt;=&lt;VALUE2&gt;
                --property:&lt;NAME1&gt;=&lt;VALUE1&gt; --property:&lt;NAME2&gt;=&lt;VALUE2&gt;

         The  short  form <b>-p</b> can be used for <b>--property</b>.  If the argument provided for the option contains <b>=</b>, <b>-p</b>
         is accepted as short for <b>--property</b>.  Otherwise, the command assumes that <b>-p</b> is short for <b>--project</b>.

         To pass <b>--property</b> to the application rather than set an MSBuild property, provide the option after the
         <b>--</b> syntax separator, for example:

                dotnet run -- --property name=value

       • <b>-r|--runtime</b> <b>&lt;RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER&gt;</b>

         Specifies the target runtime to restore packages for.  For a list of Runtime  Identifiers  (RIDs),  see
         the RID catalog.

       • <b>--tl:[auto|on|off]</b>

         Specifies  whether the <u>terminal</u> <u>logger</u> should be used for the build output.  The default is <b>auto</b>, which
         first verifies the environment before enabling terminal logging.  The environment check  verifies  that
         the  terminal  is  capable of using modern output features and isn’t using a redirected standard output
         before enabling the new logger.  <b>on</b> skips the environment check  and  enables  terminal  logging.   <b>off</b>
         skips the environment check and uses the default console logger.

         The  terminal  logger  shows you the restore phase followed by the build phase.  During each phase, the
         currently building projects appear at the bottom of the terminal.  Each project that’s building outputs
         both the MSBuild target currently being built and the amount of time spent on  that  target.   You  can
         search  this  information to learn more about the build.  When a project is finished building, a single
         “build completed” section is written that captures:

         • The name of the built project.

         • The target framework (if multi-targeted).

         • The status of that build.

         • The primary output of that build (which is hyperlinked).

         • Any diagnostics generated for that project.

         This option is available starting in .NET 8.

       • <b>-v|--verbosity</b> <b>&lt;LEVEL&gt;</b>

         Sets the verbosity level of the command.  Allowed values are <b>q[uiet]</b>, <b>m[inimal]</b>, <b>n[ormal]</b>,  <b>d[etailed]</b>,
         and  <b>diag[nostic]</b>.   The  default  is  <b>minimal</b>.  For more information, see &lt;xref:Microsoft.Build.Frame‐
         work.LoggerVerbosity&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       • Run the project in the current directory:

                dotnet run

       • Run the specified project:

                dotnet run --project ./projects/proj1/proj1.csproj

       • Run the project in the current directory, specifying Release configuration:

                dotnet run --property:Configuration=Release

       • Run the project in the current directory (the <b>--help</b> argument in this example is passed to the applica‐
         tion, since the blank <b>--</b> option is used):

                dotnet run --configuration Release -- --help

       • Restore dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory only showing minimal output and
         then run the project:

                dotnet run --verbosity m
