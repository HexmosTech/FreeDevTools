              dotnet dev-certs https -h|--help

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>dotnet</b>  <b>dev-certs</b> command manages a self-signed certificate to enable HTTPS use in local web app de‐
       velopment.  Its main functions are:

       • Generating a certificate for use with HTTPS endpoints during development.

       • Trusting the generated certificate on the local machine.

       • Removing the generated certificate from the local machine.

       • Exporting a certificate in various formats so that it can be used by other tools.

       • Importing an existing certificate generated by the tool into the local machine.

   <b>Commands</b>
       • <b>https</b>

         <b>dotnet</b> <b>dev-certs</b> has only one command: <b>https</b>.  The <b>dotnet</b>  <b>dev-certs</b>  <b>https</b>  command  with  no  options
         checks  if a development certificate is present in the current user’s certificate store on the machine.
         If the command finds a development certificate, it displays a message like the following example:

                A valid HTTPS certificate is already present.

         If the command doesn’t find a development certificate, it creates one in the current user’s certificate
         store, the store named <b>My</b> in the location <b>CurrentUser</b>.  The physical location of the certificate is  an
         implementation  detail  of  the  .NET runtime that could change at any time.  On macOS in .NET 7.0, the
         certificate is stored in the user key  chain  and  as  a  PFX  file:  <u><a href="file:~/.aspnet/https-aspnetcore-local">~/.aspnet/https-aspnetcore-local</a>‐</u>
         <u>host-&lt;Thumbprint[0..5]&gt;.pfx</u>.

         After creating a certificate, the command displays a message like the following example:

                The HTTPS developer certificate was generated successfully.

         By  default,  the  newly created certificate is not trusted.  To trust the certificate, use the <b>--trust</b>
         option.

         To create a file that you can use with other tools, use the <b>--export-path</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       • <b>-c|--check</b>

         Checks for the existence of the development certificate but doesn’t perform any action.  Use  this  op‐
         tion with the <b>--trust</b> option to check if the certificate is not only valid but also trusted.

       • <b>--clean</b>

         Removes  all  HTTPS  development  certificates from the certificate store by using the .NET certificate
         store API.  Doesn’t remove any physical files that were created by using the <b>--export-path</b> option.   On
         macOS  in  .NET  7.0,  the  <b>dotnet</b> <b>dev-certs</b> command creates the certificate on a path on disk, and the
         clean operation removes that certificate file.

         If there’s at least one certificate in the certificate store, the command displays a message  like  the
         following example:

                Cleaning HTTPS development certificates
                from the machine.
                A prompt might get displayed to confirm
                the removal of some of the certificates.

                HTTPS development certificates
                successfully removed from the machine.

       • <b>-ep|--export-path</b> <b>&lt;PATH&gt;</b>

         Exports  the certificate to a file so that it can be used by other tools.  Specify the full path to the
         exported certificate file, including the file name.  The type of certificate files that are created de‐
         pends on which options are used with <b>--export-path</b>:

         Options                                 What is exported
         ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
         <b>--export-path</b>                           The public part of the certificate as
                                                 a PFX file.
         <b>--export-path</b> <b>--format</b> <b>PEM</b>              The public part of the certificate in
                                                 PEM format.  No separate <u>.key</u> file is
                                                 created.
         <b>--export-path</b> <b>--password</b>                The public and private parts  of  the
                                                 certificate as a PFX file.
         <b>--export-path</b> <b>--password</b> <b>--format</b> <b>PEM</b>   The  public  and private parts of the
                                                 certificate as a pair of files in PEM
                                                 format.  The key file  has  the  <u>.key</u>
                                                 extension  and  is  protected  by the
                                                 given password.
         <b>--export-path</b> <b>--no-password</b>  <b>--format</b>   The  public  and private parts of the
         <b>PEM</b>                                     certificate as a pair of files in PEM
                                                 format.  The key file  has  the  <u>.key</u>
                                                 extension  and  is  exported in plain
                                                 text.  The  <b>--no-password</b>  option  is
                                                 intended for internal testing use on‐
                                                 ly.

         • <b>--format</b>

         When  used with <b>--export-path</b>, specifies the format of the exported certificate file.  Valid values are
         <b>PFX</b> and <b>PEM</b>, case-insensitive.  <b>PFX</b> is the default.

         The file format is independent of the file name extension.  For example, if you  specify  <b>--format</b>  <b>pfx</b>
         and <b>--export-path</b> <b>./cert.pem</b>, you’ll get a file named <u>cert.pem</u> in <b>PFX</b> format.

         For  information  about  the effect of this option when used with <b>--password</b>, <b>--no-password</b>, or without
         either of those options, see –export-path earlier in this article.

       • <b>-i|--import</b> <b>&lt;PATH&gt;</b>

         Imports the provided HTTPS development certificate into the local  machine.   Requires  that  you  also
         specify the <b>--clean</b> option, which clears out any existing HTTPS developer certificates.

         <b>PATH</b> specifies a path to a PFX certificate file.  Provide the password with the <b>--password</b> option.

       • <b>-np|--no-password</b>

         Doesn’t  use  a password for the key when exporting a certificate to PEM format files.  The key file is
         exported in plain text.  This option is not applicable to PFX files and is intended for internal  test‐
         ing use only.

       • <b>-p|--password</b>

         Specifies the password to use:

         • When exporting the development certificate to a PFX or PEM file.

         • When importing a PFX file.

         When  exporting  with  <b>--format</b>  <b>PEM</b>, the public and private parts of the certificate are exported as a
         pair of files in PEM format.  The key file has the <u>.key</u> extension and is protected by the  given  pass‐
         word.  In addition to the file name specified for the <b>--export-path</b> option, the command creates another
         file in the same directory with the same name but a <u>.key</u> extension.  For example, the following command
         will generate a file named <u>localhost.pem</u> and a file named <u>localhost.key</u> in the <u>/home/user</u> directory:

                dotnet dev-certs https --format pem -ep /home/user/localhost.pem -p $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$

         In the example, <b>$CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$</b> represents a password.

       • <b>-q|--quiet</b>

         Display warnings and errors only.

       • <b>-t|--trust</b>

         Trusts the certificate on the local machine.

         If  this option isn’t specified, the certificate is added to the certificate store but not to a trusted
         list.

         When combined with the <b>--check</b> option, validates that the certificate is trusted.

       • <b>-v|--verbose</b>

         Display debug information.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       • Check for the presence of a development certificate, and create one in the default certificate store if
         one doesn’t exist yet.  But don’t trust the certificate.

                dotnet dev-certs https

       • Remove any development certificates that already exist on the local machine.

                dotnet dev-certs https --clean

       • Import a PFX file.

                dotnet dev-certs https --clean --import ./certificate.pfx -p $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$

         In the preceding example, <b>$CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$</b> represents a password.

       • Check if a trusted development certificate is present on the local machine.

                dotnet dev-certs https --check --trust

       • Create a certificate, trust it, and export it to a PFX file.

                dotnet dev-certs https -ep ./certificate.pfx -p $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$ --trust

       • Create a certificate, trust it, and export it to a PEM file.

                dotnet dev-certs https -ep ./certificate.crt --trust --format PEM

       • Create a certificate, trust it, and export it to a PEM file including the private key:

                dotnet dev-certs https -ep ./certificate.crt -p $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$ --trust --format PEM
