       <b>This</b> <b>article</b> <b>applies</b> <b>to:</b> ✔️ .NET Core 2.1 SDK and later versions

       Use the following environment variables to configure the .NET SDK, .NET CLI, and .NET runtime.

   <b>DOTNET_ROOT</b>, DOTNET_ROOT(x86)
       Specifies  the location of the .NET runtimes, if they are not installed in the default location.  The de‐
       fault location on Windows is C:\Program Files\dotnet.   The  default  location  on  Linux  and  macOS  is
       /usr/share/dotnet.   This  environment  variable is used only when running apps via generated executables
       (apphosts).  DOTNET_ROOT(x86) is used instead when running a 32-bit executable on a 64-bit OS.

   <b>NUGET_PACKAGES</b>
       The global packages folder.   If  not  set,  it  defaults  to  <a href="file:~/.nuget/packages">~/.nuget/packages</a>  on  Unix  or  %userpro‐
       file%\.nuget\packages on Windows.

   <b>DOTNET_SERVICING</b>
       Specifies the location of the servicing index to use by the shared host when loading the runtime.

   <b>DOTNET_NOLOGO</b>
       Specifies  whether  .NET  welcome and telemetry messages are displayed on first run.  Set to true to mute
       these messages (values true, 1, or yes accepted) or set to false to allow (values false, 0, or no accept‐
       ed).  If not set, the default is false and the messages will be displayed on first run.  This flag has no
       effect on telemetry (see DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT for opting out of sending telemetry).

   <b>DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT</b>
       Specifies whether data about the .NET tools usage is collected and sent to Microsoft.   Set  to  true  to
       opt-out  of the telemetry feature (values true, 1, or yes accepted).  Otherwise, set to false to opt into
       the telemetry features (values false, 0, or no accepted).  If not set,  the  default  is  false  and  the
       telemetry feature is active.

   <b>DOTNET_MULTILEVEL_LOOKUP</b>
       Specifies  whether  .NET runtime, shared framework, or SDK are resolved from the global location.  If not
       set, it defaults to 1 (logical true).  Set to 0 (logical false) to not resolve from the  global  location
       and  have  isolated  .NET  installations.  For more information about multi-level lookup, see Multi-level
       SharedFX  Lookup  (https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/blob/master/Documentation/design-docs/multilevel-
       sharedfx-lookup.md).

   <b>DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD</b>
       Determines  roll  forward  behavior.  For more information, see the --roll-forward option earlier in this
       article.  <b>Available</b> <b>starting</b> <b>with</b> <b>.NET</b> <b>Core</b> <b>3.x.</b>

   <b>DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD_TO_PRERELEASE</b>
       If set to 1 (enabled), enables rolling forward to a pre-release version from a release version.   By  de‐
       fault (0 - disabled), when a release version of .NET runtime is requested, roll-forward will only consid‐
       er installed release versions.  <b>Available</b> <b>starting</b> <b>with</b> <b>.NET</b> <b>Core</b> <b>3.x.</b>

       For more information, see Roll forward.

   <b>DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD_ON_NO_CANDIDATE_FX</b>
       Disables minor version roll forward, if set to 0.  For more information, see Roll forward.

       This  setting is superseded in .NET Core 3.0 by DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD.  The new settings should be used in‐
       stead.

   <b>DOTNET_CLI_UI_LANGUAGE</b>
       Sets the language of the CLI UI using a locale value such as en-us.  The supported values are the same as
       for Visual Studio.  For more information, see the section on changing the installer language in the Visu‐
       al Studio installation documentation.  The .NET resource manager rules apply, so you don’t have  to  pick
       an  exact match—you can also pick descendants in the CultureInfo tree.  For example, if you set it to fr-
       CA, the CLI will find and use the fr translations.  If you set it to a language that  is  not  supported,
       the CLI falls back to English.

   <b>DOTNET_DISABLE_GUI_ERRORS</b>
       For  GUI-enabled  generated executables - disables dialog popup, which normally shows for certain classes
       of errors.  It only writes to stderr and exits in those cases.

   <b>DOTNET_ADDITIONAL_DEPS</b>
       Equivalent to CLI option --additional-deps.

   <b>DOTNET_RUNTIME_ID</b>
       Overrides the detected RID.

   <b>DOTNET_SHARED_STORE</b>
       Location of the “shared store” which assembly resolution falls back to in some cases.

   <b>DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS</b>
       List of assemblies to load and execute startup hooks from.

   <b>DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR</b>
       Specifies a directory to which a single-file application is extracted before it is  executed.   <b>Available</b>
       <b>starting</b> <b>with</b> <b>.NET</b> <b>Core</b> <b>3.x.</b>

       For more information, see Single-file executables.

   <b>COREHOST_TRACE</b>
       Controls diagnostics tracing from the hosting components, such as dotnet.exe, hostfxr, and hostpolicy.

       • COREHOST_TRACE=[0/1] - default is 0 - tracing disabled.  If set to 1, diagnostics tracing is enabled.

       • COREHOST_TRACEFILE=&lt;file path&gt; - only has effect if tracing is enabled via COREHOST_TRACE=1.  When set,
         the  tracing information is written to the specified file, otherwise the tracing information is written
         to stderr.  <b>Available</b> <b>starting</b> <b>with</b> <b>.NET</b> <b>Core</b> <b>3.x.</b>

       • COREHOST_TRACE_VERBOSITY=[1/2/3/4] - default is 4.  The setting is used only when  tracing  is  enabled
         via COREHOST_TRACE=1.  <b>Available</b> <b>starting</b> <b>with</b> <b>.NET</b> <b>Core</b> <b>3.x.</b>

         • 4 - all tracing information is written

         • 3 - only informational, warning and error messages are written

         • 2 - only warning and error messages are written

         • 1 - only error messages are written

       The  typical  way  to get detailed trace information about application startup is to set COREHOST_TRACE=1
       andCOREHOST_TRACEFILE=host_trace.txt and then run the application.  A new  file  host_trace.txt  will  be
       created in the current directory with the detailed information.

   <b>DOTNET_CLI_WORKLOAD_UPDATE_NOTIFY_DISABLE</b>
       Disables  background  download  of advertising manifests for workloads.  Default is false - not disabled.
       If set to true, downloading is disabled.  For more information, see Advertising manifests.

   <b>DOTNET_CLI_WORKLOAD_UPDATE_NOTIFY_INTERVAL_HOURS</b>
       Specifies the minimum number of hours between background downloads of  advertising  manifests  for  work‐
       loads.   Default is 24 - no more frequently than once a day.  For more information, see Advertising mani‐
       fests.
