</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pixmap - Xpm pixmap editor for X

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pixmap</b> [-options ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>pixmap</u> program is a tool for creating or editing rectangular images made up of colored pixels, i.e.,
       pixmaps. Pixmaps are intensively used in X to define window backgrounds, icon images, etc.

       The <u>pixmap</u> program can have two different interfaces, a  Athena  widgets  version  and  a  Motif  widgets
       version.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Pixmap</u> displays grid in which each square represents a single pixel in the picture being edited.  Squares
       can  be  set, cleared, or inverted (this last operation will be detailed later) directly with the buttons
       on the pointer and a menu of higher level operations such as draw line and fill circle is provided to the
       side of the grid.  Another menu on the top of the window allows files operations (Load, Save, ...),  edit
       operations  (Cut/Copy/Paste,  attributes  of  pixmap  editing, ...) and colors operations (drawing color,
       attributes of colors, ...). <u>Pixmap</u> uses a Pixmap widget to represent the pixmap image.

       Pixmaps are stored as a C string array variable suitable for including in applications, using the  format
       defined  by  Arnaud  Le Hors in his Xpm library (refer to Xpm manual for format description). This format
       allows pixmaps to be used indistinctly on monochrome, grey scale or color displays.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

           colormap.

</pre><h4><b>PIXELS</b> <b>EDITING</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>MOUSE</b></h4><pre>
       Pixels  may  be  set,  cleared, or inverted by pointing to them and clicking one of the buttons indicated
       below.  Multiple pixels can be changed at once by holding the button down and dragging the cursor  across
       them.   Set  pixels are filled with the current color; cleared pixels are filled with white; and inverted
       pixels are either set if they were originally cleared or cleared otherwise.

            <u>Button</u> <u>1</u>
                This button (usually leftmost on the pointer) is used to set one or more pixels.

            <u>Button</u> <u>2</u>
                This button (usually in the middle) is used to invert one or more pixels.

            <u>Button</u> <u>3</u>
                This button (usually on the right) is used to clear one or more pixels.

            <u>Button</u> <u>4</u>
                This button is used to clear one or more pixels.

            <u>Button</u> <u>5</u>
                This button is used to clear one or more pixels.

       Every button operation can be changed by means  of  resources  in  the  .Xdefaults  file  or  application
       defaults file (/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Pixmap).

</pre><h4><b>MENU</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       To  make defining shapes easier, <u>pixmap</u> provides several commands for drawing and manipulating the pixmap
       edited, and commands for file management.

       Commands are layed in a vertical bar at the left of the Pixmap widget and in a menu bar at the top of the
       window. Most of the drawing commands are located in the left bar, where  as  file  management  and  other
       general commands are located in the top menu bar.

       In  the  left  bar,  some commands are represented by icons. They are, from left to right and up to down,
       <u>Flip</u> <u>horizontally</u>, <u>Up</u>, <u>Flip</u> <u>vertically</u>, <u>Left</u>, <u>Fold</u>, <u>Right</u>, <u>Rotate</u> <u>right</u> (counterclock), <u>Down</u>, <u>Rotate</u> <u>left</u>
       (clockwise).

       Some commands are also available directly through the keyboard when the mouse cursor is  located  on  the
       Pixmap widget. They will be mentioned as an accelerator in the following description.

       LEFT BAR COMMANDS

            <u>Undo</u>
                This  command  is  used  to  undo  the  last  operation.  Only one operation can be undone.  The
                accelerator of this command is Any&lt;Key&gt;u.

            <u>Clear</u>
                This command is used to clear all of the pixels in the pixmap as if Button 3  had  been  dragged
                through every pixel in the pixmap.  The accelerator of this command is [Shift]&lt;Key&gt;c.

            <u>Set</u> This command is used to set all of the pixels in the pixmap to the current color, as if Button 1
                had  been  dragged  through  every  pixel  in  the  pixmap.   The accelerator of this command is
                [Shift]&lt;Key&gt;s.

            <u>Redraw</u>
                This command is used to redisplay the pixmap.  The accelerator of this command is Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;l.

            <u>Copy</u>
                This command is used to copy a region of the pixmap from one  location  to  another.  When  this
                command is invoked, the region to copy should
                 be  specified  by  pressing Button 1, dragging the mouse and releasing Button 1. The region can
                now be copied by pressing Button 1 with the cursor located on the region selected, dragging  the
                mouse  and releasing it where the upper left corner of the region should be copied.  If a region
                was already selected with a Mark command, only the second phase of the copy is  necessary.   The
                accelerator  of  this  command  is  available  when  a  region  has already been selected and is
                Ctrl&lt;Btn2Down&gt; to drag the region and Ctrl&lt;Btn2Up&gt; to draw it to point. This accelerated command
                is identical to the Paste command available through the <u>Edit</u> menu of the top menu bar.

            <u>Move</u>
                This command is used to move a region of the pixmap from one  location  to  another.  When  this
                command  is  invoked,  the region to move should be specified by pressing Button 1, dragging the
                mouse and releasing Button 1. The region can now be moved by pressing Button 1 with  the  cursor
                located  on the region selected, dragging the mouse and releasing it where the upper left corner
                of the region should be moved. The initial region is cleared.  If a region was already  selected
                with a Mark command, only the second phase of the move is necessary.

            <u>Mark</u>
                This  command  is used to mark a region to move or copy it later (commands <u>Move</u> and <u>Copy</u> above),
                or to put it in the Cut&amp;Paste buffer (commands <u>Cut</u> and <u>Copy</u> of the <u>Edit</u> menu  of  the  top  menu
                bar).  When  this  command  is  invoked,  the  region  should be specified by pressing Button 1,
                dragging the mouse and releasing  Button  1.  Once  marked,  the  region  is  highlighted.   The
                accelerator  of  this  command  is  Ctrl&lt;Btn1Down&gt; to initiate the selection and Ctrl&lt;Btn1Up&gt; to
                finish it.

            <u>Unmark</u>
                This command is used to unmark a region previously marked. It will unhighlight the region.   The
                accelerator of this command is Ctrl&lt;Btn3Down&gt;.

            <u>Flip</u> <u>horizontally</u>
                This  command  is  used  to  flip horizontally the whole pixmap or the marked region. This means
                mirroring horizontally the pixmap image. The mirror is  placed  at  the  middle  of  the  pixmap
                height.  The accelerator of this command is [Shift|Ctrl]&lt;Key&gt;h.

            <u>Up</u>  This command is used to move the whole pixmap or the marked region up.  Pixels at the top of the
                pixmap  are  pushed  back  at  the bottom of the new pixmap.  The accelerator of this command is
                Any&lt;Key&gt;Up (not available in Motif version).

            <u>Flip</u> <u>vertically</u>
                This command is used to flip vertically the whole  pixmap  or  the  marked  region.  This  means
                mirroring  vertically  the pixmap image. The mirror is placed at the middle of the pixmap width.
                The accelerator of this command is Any&lt;Key&gt;v.

            <u>Left</u>
                This command is used to move the whole pixmap or the marked region left.  Pixels at the left  of
                the  pixmap  are pushed back at the right of the new pixmap.  The accelerator of this command is
                Any&lt;Key&gt;Left (not available in Motif version).

            <u>Fold</u>
                This command is used to "Fold" the pixmap. This means splitting the pixmap image in four squares
                (top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right) and inverting them (top becomes bottom, left
                becomes right, and so on).  "Folding" twice a pixmap does no change.  The  accelerator  of  this
                command is [Shift|Ctrl]&lt;Key&gt;f.

            <u>Right</u>
                This command is used to move the whole pixmap or the marked region right. Pixels at the right of
                the  pixmap  are  pushed back at the left of the new pixmap.  The accelerator of this command is
                Any&lt;Key&gt;Right (not available in Motif version).

            <u>Rotate</u> <u>right</u>
                This command is used to rotate the pixmap image or the marked region  right  (clockwise)  of  90
                degrees.   Four  <u>Rotate</u>  <u>right</u>  operations  does  no change.  The accelerator of this command is
                [Shift|Ctrl]&lt;Key&gt;r.

            <u>Down</u>
                This command is used to move the whole pixmap or the marked region down. Pixels at the bottom of
                the pixmap are pushed back at the top of the new pixmap.  The accelerator  of  this  command  is
                Any&lt;Key&gt;Down (not available in Motif version).

            <u>Rotate</u> <u>left</u>
                This  command  is used to rotate the pixmap image or the marked region left (counterclock) of 90
                degrees. Four <u>Rotate</u> <u>left</u> operations does  no  change.   The  accelerator  of  this  command  is
                [Shift]&lt;Key&gt;l.

            <u>Point</u>
                This command is used to set, invert or clear a pixel to the current color.  It can be considered
                as  a mode. After selecting it, pixels are set, inverted or cleared depending on the button used
                (see Pixels Editing with the Mouse). If the mouse button  remains  pressed  while  dragging  the
                mouse, more than one pixel can be affected.  This command has no accelerator.

            <u>Curve</u>
                This  command is used to draw curved lines (set, cleared or inverted).  The curve is drawn while
                dragging the mouse. This command can be considered as a mode.  Quite  the  same  affect  can  be
                obtained  by  dragging  the  mouse  in  point mode, the main difference resides in the fact that
                pixels will be drawn contiguously.  This command has no accelerator.

            <u>Line</u>
                This command is used to draw lines between two points (set, cleared or inverted). The lines  are
                first  drawn highlighted while mouse button remains pressed. This command can be considered as a
                mode.  This command has no accelerator.

            <u>Rectangle</u>
                This command is used to draw rectangles between two points defining the two opposite corners  of
                the  rectangle  (set,  cleared  or  inverted).  The rectangles are first drawn highlighted while
                mouse button remains pressed. This command can be considered as a mode.   This  command  has  no
                accelerator.

            <u>Filled</u> <u>Rectangle</u>
                This  command  is  used  to  draw filled rectangles between two points defining the two opposite
                corners of the rectangle (set, cleared or inverted).  The rectangles outlines  are  first  drawn
                highlighted  while mouse button remains pressed. This command can be considered as a mode.  This
                command has no accelerator.

            <u>Circle</u>
                This command will set, invert or clear the pixels on a circle specified by a center and a  point
                on  the  curve.  Small circles may not look very round because of the size of the pixmap and the
                limits of having to work with discrete pixels. This command can be considered as a  mode.   This
                command has no accelerator.

            <u>Filled</u> <u>Circle</u>
                This command will set, invert or clear all of the pixels in a circle specified by a center and a
                point  on  the  curve.  All  pixels  side  and including the circle are set. This command can be
                considered as a mode.  This command has no accelerator.

            <u>Flood</u> <u>Fill</u>
                This command will set all clear pixels in an enclosed shape. The enclosed shape is determined by
                all the pixels whose color is different from the color of  the  pixel  on  which  the  user  has
                clicked.   If  the  shape  is  not closed, the entire pixmap will be filled. This command can be
                considered as a mode.  This command has no accelerator.

            <u>Set</u> <u>Hot</u> <u>Spot</u>
                This command allows the specification of a Hot Spot. The Hot Spot is selected  by  clicking  the
                <u>Set</u>  mouse  button.  Clicking  <u>Invert</u> will invert the Hot Spot, set or reset it depending on its
                previous state. Hot spot is useful for cursor pixmaps and are used  to  reference  the  sensible
                part of the pixmap.  This command has no accelerator.

            <u>Clear</u> <u>Hot</u> <u>Spot</u>
                This command clears the current Hot Spot.  This command has no accelerator.

            <u>Set</u> <u>Port</u>
                This  command  allows  one  to  create  a  Port  extension  line  graphically. It is part of the
                customized Port extension editor developed by Tim Wise (SES Inc.). The Port is set on the pixmap
                image by clicking any of the mouse button.  This command has no acelerator.

            <u>Clear</u> <u>Port</u>
                This command allows one to remove  a  Port  extension  line  graphically.  It  is  part  of  the
                customized Port extension editor developed by Tim Wise (SES Inc.). The Port onto which any mouse
                button was clicked is cancelled.  This command has no accelerator.

            <u>Move</u> <u>Port</u>
                This  command allows one to move a Port, that is to change the coordinates specified in the Port
                extension line. It is part of the customized Port extension editor developed by  Tim  Wise  (SES
                Inc.). The Port onto which any mouse button was pressed is moved with the mouse cursor until the
                mouse button is released.  This command has no accelerator.

            <u>Port</u> <u>Info...</u>
                This  command  allows  one  to edit the information associated to a Port, that is contained in a
                Port extension line. It is part of the customized Port extension editor developed  by  Tim  Wise
                (SES Inc.).  The information associated with the Port onto which any mouse button was clicked is
                displayed  in  a dialog window. It can be edited in that dialog and saved by clicking the "Okay"
                button of the dialog.  This command has no accelerator.

       TOP MENU COMMANDS

            <u>Info</u>
                This command pops up an info window.

       <u>File</u> MENU

            <u>Load...</u>
                This command is used to load a pixmap file in the pixmap editor. A dialog window is poped up  in
                which  a filename has to be provided. The operation can be interrupted with the <u>Cancel</u> button of
                the dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Alt&lt;Key&gt;l.

            <u>Insert...</u>
                This command is used to load a pixmap in the Cut&amp;Paste buffer of the pixmap editor. The contents
                of the pixmap file can then be pasted on the current pixmap. A dialog  window  is  poped  up  in
                which  a filename has to be provided. The operation can be interrupted with the <u>Cancel</u> button of
                the dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Alt&lt;Key&gt;i.

            <u>Save</u>
                This command is used to save the current pixmap in the current  file  edited.  By  default,  and
                until  otherwise changed by a <u>Filename...</u>, <u>Load...</u> or <u>Save</u> <u>As...</u> operation, or by specifying the
                filename on the command line, the filename is <u>scratch</u>. The <u>Filename...</u> command can  be  used  to
                change this default filename.  The accelerator of this command is Alt&lt;Key&gt;s.

            <u>Save</u> <u>As...</u>
                This  command  is  used  to  save  the  current pixmap in a particular file which name has to be
                provided in the dialog window which pops up. The operation can be interrupted  with  the  <u>Cancel</u>
                button of the dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Alt&lt;Key&gt;a.

            <u>Resize...</u>
                This  command  is  used  to  resize  the current pixmap to the width and height specified in the
                dialog window which pops up. The syntax is WIDTHxHEIGHT. This operation is  different  from  the
                <u>Rescale...</u>   one  in  the  way  that  it just add or remove pixels to the current pixmap without
                trying to fit the space correctly with the pixmap image. The operation can be  interrupted  with
                the <u>Cancel</u> button of the dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Alt&lt;Key&gt;r.

            <u>Rescale...</u>
                This  command  is  used  to rescale the current pixmap image in order to make it fit a larger or
                smaller space. The new width and height have to be specified in the dialog window which pops  up
                with  the  syntax  WIDTHxHEIGHT.  The operation can be interrupted with the <u>Cancel</u> button of the
                dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Alt&lt;Key&gt;e.

            <u>Filename...</u>
                This command is used to change the current filename, i.e., the name of the  file  in  which  the
                pixmap  will  be saved with a <u>Save</u> operation.  The new filename has to be provided in the dialog
                window which pops up. The operation can be interrupted with the  <u>Cancel</u>  button  of  the  dialog
                window.  The accelerator of this command is Alt&lt;Key&gt;f.

            <u>Hints</u> <u>comment...</u>
                This  command pops up a dialog window in which the user can specify the hints section comment of
                the pixmap file. The operation can be interrupted with the <u>Cancel</u> button of the  dialog  window.
                The accelerator of this command is Alt&lt;Key&gt;h.

            <u>Colors</u> <u>comment...</u>
                This command pops up a dialog window in which the user can specify the colors section comment of
                the  pixmap  file. The operation can be interrupted with the <u>Cancel</u> button of the dialog window.
                The accelerator of this command is Alt&lt;Key&gt;c.

            <u>Pixels</u> <u>comment...</u>
                This command pops up a dialog window in which the user can specify the pixels section comment of
                the pixmap file. The operation can be interrupted with the <u>Cancel</u> button of the  dialog  window.
                The accelerator of this command is Alt&lt;Key&gt;p.

            <u>Quit</u>
                This  command  causes  <u>pixmap</u>  to  display a dialog box asking whether or not it should save the
                pixmap (if it has changed) and then exit.  Answering <u>yes</u> is the same as invoking <u>Save</u>; <u>no</u> causes
                <u>pixmap</u> to simply exit; and <u>cancel</u> will abort the <u>Quit</u> command so that more changes may be  made.
                The accelerator of this command is Alt&lt;Key&gt;q.

       <u>Edit</u> MENU

            <u>Image</u>
                This command pops up a window in which the real size pixmap is shown.  This window can be closed
                by  clicking  the mouse in it or by invoking <u>Image</u> once again. When the window is poped up, an <u>X</u>
                mark is displayed in the menu at the left of the <u>Image</u> label.  The accelerator of  this  command
                is &lt;Key&gt;i.

            <u>Grid</u>
                This  command toggles the display of the grid. When the grid is displayed, an <u>X</u> mark is added at
                the left of the <u>Grid</u> label.  The accelerator of this command is &lt;Key&gt;g.

            <u>Axes</u>
                This command toggles the display of axes. When axes are displayed, an <u>X</u> mark  is  added  at  the
                left of the <u>Axes</u> label.  The accelerator of this command is &lt;Key&gt;a.

            <u>Proportional</u>
                This  command  toggles  the display in proportional mode of the pixmap.  Proportional mode means
                that the Pixmap widget won't try to fit all the available space within the  interface  and  will
                rather  display  each  pixel  in a square, probably leaving some space around the pixmap widget.
                When the proportional mode is active, an <u>X</u> mark is added at the left of the <u>Proportional</u>  label.
                The accelerator of this command is &lt;Key&gt;p.

            <u>Zoom</u>
                This  command  is  used  to zoom some pixels of the current pixmap. The zooming region has to be
                selected by the use as a rectangle region just as if he was marking a region (see <u>Mark</u> command).
                The operation can be interrupted by invoking any other command. When a region is  zoomed,  an  <u>X</u>
                mark  is  added  at  the left of the <u>Zoom</u> label. Invoking once again the <u>Zoom</u> command zooms out.
                The accelerator of this command is &lt;Key&gt;z.

            <u>Zoom</u> <u>In</u>
                This command is used to incrementaly zoom into the current pixmap.  This side effect of this  is
                to  enlarge  the  size  of  a  square used to represent a single pixel.  The accelerator of this
                command is &lt;Key&gt;x.

            <u>Zoom</u> <u>Out</u>
                This command is used to incrementaly zoom out of the current pixmap.  This side effect  of  this
                is  to  reduce  the  size of a square used to represent a single pixel.  The accelerator of this
                command is &lt;Key&gt;y.

            <u>Zooming</u> <u>Factor</u>
                The command pops up a dialog window in which the user can edit the current zooming factor.   The
                zooming  factor is the size of a square used to represent a single pixel.  Enlarging the zooming
                factor will zoom into the current pixmap, while reducing it will zoom out of  the  pixmap.   The
                accelerator of this command is &lt;Key&gt;f.

            <u>Cut</u> When  a region is marked, this operation is active. It is used to cut the contents of the region
                to put it in the Cut&amp;Paste buffer. The <u>Paste</u> command now becomes active and the marked region is
                unmarked. The pixels in the marked region are cleared. This command acts as the <u>Move</u> one when  a
                region is already marked.  The accelerator of this command is Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;c.

            <u>Copy</u>
                When a region is marked, this operation is active. It is used to copy the contents of the region
                in the Cut&amp;Paste buffer. The <u>Paste</u> command now becomes active and the marked region is unmarked.
                This  command  acts as the <u>Copy</u> command of the left border when a region is already marked.  The
                accelerator of this command is Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;x.

            <u>Paste</u>
                When a region has been cut or copied in the Cut&amp;Paste buffer, this command is active and can  be
                used  to paste the contents of the Cut&amp;Paste buffer where the mouse button is clicked. The paste
                operation takes care of the button used to specify the point where  to  paste  the  buffer.  The
                button  can remain pressed to move the buffer around and then be released to paste the buffer at
                the current location.  A <u>Copy</u> and <u>Paste</u>  operation  can  be  accelerated  by  Ctrl&lt;Btn2Down&gt;  to
                intiate  the  operation  and  Ctrl&lt;Btn2Up&gt; to finish the operation, i.e., paste the buffer.  The
                accelerator of this command is Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;p.

            <u>Crop</u>
                When a region is marked, or a file has been inserted in the Cut&amp;Paste buffer, this command  will
                exchange the current pixmap with the marked region, or the Cut&amp;Paste buffer. Cropping twice does
                nothing.  The accelerator of this command is Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;o.

       <u>Foreground</u> <u>Color</u> MENU

            <u>Add</u> <u>color...</u>
                This  command  is  used  to  add  a  new color in the <u>Color</u> <u>Panel</u> (see below). The color name is
                specified in the dialog window which pops up either by a real color name found in  rgb.txt  file
                or  by a string like <u>#rrggbb</u> where <u>rr</u>, <u>gg</u> and <u>bb</u> represent the red, green and blue components of
                the color in hexadecimal format. The operation can be interrupted with the <u>Cancel</u> button of  the
                dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;a.

            <u>Symbolic</u> <u>name...</u>
                This  command  is  used  to  set  the  symbolic name of the current color.  The symbolic name is
                entered in the dialog window which pops up. The operation can be  interrupted  with  the  <u>Cancel</u>
                button of the dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;s.

            <u>Monochrome</u> <u>name...</u>
                This  command  is  used  to  set the monochrome name of the current color, i.e., the name of the
                color to use on monochrome displays. The monochrome name is entered in the dialog  window  which
                pops  up.  The  operation  can  be interrupted with the <u>Cancel</u> button of the dialog window.  The
                accelerator of this command is Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;m.

            <u>Grey</u> <u>scale</u> <u>4</u> <u>name...</u>
                This command is used to set the grey scale 4 name of the current color, i.e., the  name  of  the
                color  to  use  on grey scale 4 displays.  The grey scale 4 name is entered in the dialog window
                which pops up.  The operation can be interrupted with the <u>Cancel</u> button of  the  dialog  window.
                The accelerator of this command is Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;4.

            <u>Grey</u> <u>scale</u> <u>name...</u>
                This  command  is  used  to  set the grey scale name of the current color, i.e., the name of the
                color to use on grey scale (with more then 4 levels) displays.  The grey scale name  is  entered
                in  the  dialog window which pops up. The operation can be interrupted with the <u>Cancel</u> button of
                the dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;g.

            <u>Color</u> <u>name...</u>
                This command is used to set the color name of the current color. This change will be  considered
                when  saving  the  pixmap  but  to  remain visible, it affects the label of the menu item of the
                color. This is useful to directly change a specific color for another one or to  allow  multiple
                symbols  to  represent  the same color (the color can be the same on color display but change on
                grey scale or monochrome ones).  The color name is entered in the dialog window which  pops  up.
                The operation can be interrupted with the <u>Cancel</u> button of the dialog window. The <u>None</u> (not case
                sensitive) name is used to change the pixel representing the transparent color.  The accelerator
                of this command is Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;n.

       <u>Xpm</u> <u>Extensions</u> MENU

            <u>Add</u> <u>Extension...</u>
                This  command pops up a dialog window into which the user provides a name for an extension to be
                added in the current pixmap extensions list. The operation can be interrupted  with  the  <u>Cancel</u>
                button  of  the dialog window. If the user confirms with the <u>Okay</u> button, another dialog windows
                pops up where the user can edit the extension contents. When  the  user  clicks  on  the  <u>Cancel</u>
                button  into  this extension editing window, the edit operation is interrupted but the extension
                is added to the extensions list of the current pixmap. If the  user  wishes  to  abort  the  <u>Add</u>
                <u>Extension...</u> operation, he/she needs to click on the <u>Remove</u> button. The edition can otherwise be
                confirmed by clicking on the <u>Okay</u> button.

            <u>Any</u> <u>extension</u> <u>name</u>
                WHen an extension is added in the extensions list of the current pixmap, its name appears in the
                <u>Xpm</u>  <u>Extensions</u> menu. When selected in the menu, the extension edition window pops up. See above
                for its description.

       In addition the Motif version defines the status label as two active buttons which operate as <u>Filename...</u>
       and <u>Resize...</u> commands.

</pre><h4><b>COLOR</b> <b>PANEL</b></h4><pre>
       Colors in pixmap are presented in the <u>Color</u> <u>Panel</u>. Each loaded  color  is  associated  a  square  button,
       filled  with  the  color pixel.  Scrollbars around the panel enable scanning the whole panel. To choose a
       color for drawing, the user must click on a color button. At this time, the current name of the color  is
       displayed as the title of the <u>Foreground</u> <u>Color</u> menu. A color can also be selected by using Shift&lt;BtnDown&gt;
       on  a  pixel  of  the  current  pixmap  which  color should be used. This accelerator is very useful when
       modifying small parts of a pixmap locally.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>Save</u> or <u>Save</u> <u>As...</u> commands store pixmaps using the format defined by  Arnaud  Le  Hors  in  his  Xpm
       library  (version  3.x).   Each  pixmap is a C string array variable that can be included and used within
       programs, or referred to by X Toolkit pixmap resources (assuming that a String to  Pixmap  converter  has
       been registered on the server). Here is an example of a pixmap file:

                     /* XPM */
                     static char * plaid[] = {
                     /* plaid pixmap
                      * width height ncolors chars_per_pixel */
                     "22 22 4 2 ",
                     /* colors */
                     "   c red         m white  s light_color ",
                     "Y  c yellow      m black  s lines_in_mix ",
                     "+  c yellow      m white  s lines_in_dark ",
                     "x                m black  s dark_color ",
                     /* pixels */
                     "x   x   x x x   x   x x x x x x + x x x x x ",
                     "  x   x   x   x   x   x x x x x x x x x x x ",
                     "x   x   x x x   x   x x x x x x + x x x x x ",
                     "  x   x   x   x   x   x x x x x x x x x x x ",
                     "x   x   x x x   x   x x x x x x + x x x x x ",
                     "Y Y Y Y Y x Y Y Y Y Y + x + x + x + x + x + ",
                     "x   x   x x x   x   x x x x x x + x x x x x ",
                     "  x   x   x   x   x   x x x x x x x x x x x ",
                     "x   x   x x x   x   x x x x x x + x x x x x ",
                     "  x   x   x   x   x   x x x x x x x x x x x ",
                     "x   x   x x x   x   x x x x x x + x x x x x ",
                     "          x           x   x   x Y x   x   x ",
                     "          x             x   x   Y   x   x   ",
                     "          x           x   x   x Y x   x   x ",
                     "          x             x   x   Y   x   x   ",
                     "          x           x   x   x Y x   x   x ",
                     "x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x ",
                     "          x           x   x   x Y x   x   x ",
                     "          x             x   x   Y   x   x   ",
                     "          x           x   x   x Y x   x   x ",
                     "          x             x   x   Y   x   x   ",
                     "          x           x   x   x Y x   x   x "
                     } ;

       The <b>plaid</b> name used to reference the pixmap variable is constructed from the name of the file in which is
       saved the pixmap.  Any directories are stripped off the front of the name and any suffix beginning with a
       period is stripped off the end.

       The  pixmap variable is a string array in which the first string of the array contains the width, height,
       number of colors and number of characters per pixel.

       The following strings represent the color descriptions, one string per color. A color description can  be
       composed  of  one  or  more characters that represent a pixel, and color display name preceded by the `c'
       character, and/or a symbolic name preceded by  the  `s'  character,  and/or  a  monochrome  display  name
       preceded  by  the  `m' character, and or a grey scale 4 levels display name preceded by the string `g4' ,
       and/or a grey scale display name preceded by the aharacter `g', specified in any order.

       Following color description strings, each string represent a line of the  pixmap,  composed  of  symbolic
       characters assigned to colors.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>PIXMAPS</b> <b>IN</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b></h4><pre>
       The  format  of  pixmap  files  is  designed to make pixmaps easy to use within X programs, whatever your
       display is.  The following code could be used to create a pixmap to use as a window background, using the
       enhanced Xpm library (version 3.3) from Groupe Bull and assuming that the pixmap was  stored  in  a  file
       name <u>plaid.xpm</u>:

               #include "plaid.xpm"

               Pixmap pixmap;

               XpmCreatePixmapFromData (display, drawable, plaid, &amp;pixmap,
                            &amp;pixmap_mask, &amp;attributes);

       Additional  routines  are  available  for  reading  in <u>pixmap</u> files and returning the data in the file in
       Pixmaps.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>HIERARCHY</b></h4><pre>
       The hierarchy of the pixmap editor is discribed here in order to configure  the  editor  by  means  of  X
       resources  in a .Xdefaults file.  The first widget class is the Athena version one, while the second one,
       separated by a | character, is the Motif version one.

       Lines where only appears one or the other type of a widget (like Dialog|  or  |CascadeButtonGadget)  mean
       that  the  widget doesn't exist in one or the other version. In the case of dialogs in the Motif version,
       the widgets are created by means of convenient routines which assign the name of the widget depending  on
       the  name of the dialog. By the way, we can't provide with a list of types and names for the substructure
       of dialog widgets in the Motif version. However, these shouldn't be often modified.

</pre><h4><b>X</b> <b>DEFAULTS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>Proportional</b>
           Toggles initial proportional display mode.

       <b>Grid</b>
           Toggles initial grid display.

       <b>GridTolerance</b>
           Determines when to display grid according to SquareSize.

       <b>Stippled</b>
           Suppress stipple drawing of transparent pixels.

       <b>Stipple</b>
           Depth 1 pixmap to use to draw transparent pixels stippled.

       <b>Axes</b>
           Toggles axes display.

       <b>Resize</b>
           Toggles Pixmap widget resize when requesting by window manager.

       <b>Distance</b>
           The margin around Pixmap widget.

       <b>SquareSize</b>
           The size in screen points used to display each pixmap pixels.

       <b>PixmapWidth</b>
           The initial width of the pixmap.

       <b>PixmapHeight</b>
           The initial height of the pixmap.

       <b>Button1Action</b>
           The action associated to mouse button 1 (between Set, Invert and Clear).

       <b>Button2Action</b>
           The action associated to mouse button 2 (between Set, Invert and Clear).

       <b>Button3Action</b>
           The action associated to mouse button 3 (between Set, Invert and Clear).

       <b>Button4Action</b>
           The action associated to mouse button 4 (between Set, Invert and Clear).

       <b>Button5Action</b>
           The action associated to mouse button 5 (between Set, Invert and Clear).

       <b>Filename</b>
           The initial file to load.

       <b>AddColorNtfyProc</b>
           The  procedure to call when reading a pixmap file to notify color loading. It is strongly advised not
           to change this resource.

       <b>ExtensionNtfyProc</b>
           The procedure to call when reading a pixmap file to notify extension loading. It is strongly  advised
           not to change this resource.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1),  <u>Xpm</u>  <u>library</u>  <u>manual</u>,   <u>Xlib</u>  <u>-</u>  <u>C</u>  <u>Language</u> <u>X</u> <u>Interface</u> (particularly the section on <u>Manipulating</u>
       <u>Pixmaps</u>)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If you move the pointer too fast while holding a pointer button down, some pixels may be missed.  This is
       caused by limitations in how frequently the X server can sample the pointer location.

       Loading a pixmap file  where  the  same  color  is  used  more  than  once  with  different  symbols  and
       descriptions,  and writing it will loose information concerning the color used more than once. The pixmap
       file plaid given as an example in this man won't be saved that way by <u>pixmap</u>.

       Accelerators to menu operations don't seem to work with Athena version.

       In the Motif version, the <u>Filename...</u> and <u>Resize...</u>  commands open their respective dialog  window  in  a
       strange  mode.  The  user  has  to  voluntary (;-) give the focus to the text widget inside to be able to
       change its content.
