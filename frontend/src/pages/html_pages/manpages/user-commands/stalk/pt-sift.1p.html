</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pt-sift - Browses files created by pt-stalk.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: pt-sift FILE|PREFIX|DIRECTORY

       pt-sift browses files created by pt-stalk.  If no options are given, the tool browses all pt-stalk files
       in "/var/lib/pt-stalk" if that directory exists, else the current working directory is used.  If a FILE
       is given, the tool browses files with the same prefix in the given file's directory.  If a PREFIX is
       given, the tool browses files in "/var/lib/pt-stalk" (or the current working directory) with the same
       prefix.  If a DIRECTORY is given, the tool browses all pt-stalk files in it.

</pre><h4><b>RISKS</b></h4><pre>
       Percona Toolkit is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested, but all database tools can pose a
       risk to the system and the database server.  Before using this tool, please:

       •   Read the tool's documentation

       •   Review the tool's known "BUGS"

       •   Test the tool on a non-production server

       •   Backup your production server and verify the backups

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pt-sift  downloads  other  tools  that  it might need, such as pt-diskstats, and then makes a list of the
       unique timestamp prefixes of all the files in the directory, as written by the  pt-stalk  tool.   If  the
       user  specified  a  timestamp  on the command line, then it begins with that sample of data; otherwise it
       begins by showing a list of the timestamps and prompting for a  selection.   Thereafter,  it  displays  a
       summary  of  the  selected  sample, and the user can navigate and inspect with keystrokes.  The keystroke
       commands you can use are as follows:

       •   d

           Sets the action to start the pt-diskstats tool on the sample's disk performance statistics.

       •   i

           Sets the action to view the first INNODB STATUS sample in less.

       •   m

           Displays the first 4 samples of SHOW STATUS counters side by side with the pt-mext tool.

       •   n

           Summarizes the first sample of netstat data in two ways:  by  originating  host,  and  by  connection
           state.

       •   j

           Select the next timestamp as the active sample.

       •   k

           Select the previous timestamp as the active sample.

       •   q

           Quit the program.

       •   1

           Sets the action for each sample to the default, which is to view a summary of the sample.

       •   Sets the action to just list the files in the sample.

       •   *

           Sets the action to view all of the sample's files in the less program.
