       gnunet-revocation — revoke private keys (of egos) in GNUnet

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gnunet-revocation</b>  [<b>-t</b>  <u>KEY</u>  |  <b>--test=</b><u>KEY</u>]  [<b>-e</b>  <u>EPOCHS</u>  |  <b>--epochs=</b><u>EPOCHS</u>]  [<b>-R</b>  <u>NAME</u> | <b>--revoke=</b><u>NAME</u>]
                         [<b>-p</b>  |  <b>--perform</b>]  [<b>-f</b>  <u>NAME</u>  |  <b>--filename=</b><u>NAME</u>]  [<b>-c</b>  <u>FILENAME,</u>   <b>--config=</b><u>FILENAME</u>]
                         [<b>-h</b> | <b>--help</b>] [<b>-L</b> <u>LOGLEVEL</u> | <b>--loglevel=</b><u>LOGLEVEL</u>] [<b>-v</b> | <b>--version</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gnunet-revocation</b> can be used to verify if a key has been revoked, to create a revocation certificate for
       later revocation, to instantly revoke a key and to use a pre-generated revocation certificate to revoke a
       key.  Upon successful revocation, all peers will be informed about the invalidity of the key.  As this is
       an  expensive  operation,  GNUnet requires the issuer of the revocation to perform an expensive proof-of-
       work computation before they will be allowed to perform the revocation.  gnunet-revocation  will  perform
       this  computation.   The  computation  can  be  performed  ahead  of  time, with the resulting revocation
       certificate being stored in a file for later "instant" use.  gnunet-revocation also makes is possible  to
       resume  the  pre-calculation  of  a  revocation --- simply abort a running proof-of-work calculation with
       CTRL-C, and the existing revocation certificate file will contain the status of  the  computation.   Note
       that  performing  a  revocation proof-of-work is deliberately VERY expensive.  Depending on your CPU, the
       calculation can take days or weeks.

       <b>-t</b> <u>KEY</u> | <b>--test=</b><u>KEY</u>
               Check if the given KEY (ASCII-encoded public key required) has been revoked.

       <b>-e</b> <u>EPOCHS</u> | <b>--epochs=</b><u>EPOCHS</u>
               Number of epochs for which the revocation should be valid (default: 1)

       <b>-R</b> <u>NAME</u> | <b>--revoke=</b><u>NAME</u>
               Calculate or perform revocation for the ego with the given NAME.

       <b>-p</b> | <b>--perform</b>
               Actually perform the  revocation  as  soon  as  possible  (do  not  just  generate  a  revocation
               certificate, use it).  Must be supplied to actually perform the revocation.

       <b>-f</b> <u>NAME</u> | <b>--filename=</b><u>NAME</u>
               Use  NAME  as  the  name of the file that is to contain the revocation certificate.  Intermediate
               computation results will be stored here, as well as the final revocation certificate.  When  used
               together  with  -p,  this  file  will  be inspected to see if it contains a valid certificate for
               instant revocation, in which case the revocation can be performed instantly.  If the  given  file
               contains  anything (a valid certificate, with or without the completed proof-of-work) there is no
               need to supply the "-R" option or to still have the  private  key  of  the  ego  to  perform  the
               revocation.

       <b>-c</b> <u>FILENAME,</u> <b>--config=</b><u>FILENAME</u>
               Use the configuration file FILENAME.

       <b>-h</b> | <b>--help</b>
               Print short help on options.

       <b>-L</b> <u>LOGLEVEL</u> | <b>--loglevel=</b><u>LOGLEVEL</u>
               Use LOGLEVEL for logging.  Valid values are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING and ERROR.

       <b>-v</b> | <b>--version</b>
               Print GNUnet version number.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The  full documentation for gnunet is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the <u><a href="../man1/info.1.html">info</a></u>(1) and gnunet programs
       are properly installed at your site, the command

             <b>info</b> <b>gnunet</b>

       should give you access to the complete handbook,

             <b>info</b> <b>gnunet-c-tutorial</b>

       will give you access to a tutorial for developers.

       Depending on your installation, this information is also available in <u><a href="../man7/gnunet.7.html">gnunet</a></u>(7) and <u><a href="../man7/gnunet-c-tutorial.7.html">gnunet-c-tutorial</a></u>(7).
