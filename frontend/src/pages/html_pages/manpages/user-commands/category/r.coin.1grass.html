</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>r.coin</u> tabulates the mutual occurrence of two raster map layers’ categories with respect to one  another.
       This analysis program respects the current geographic region and mask settings.

       <u>r.coin</u> tabulates the coincidence of category values among the two map layers and prepares the basic table
       from  which  the  report  is to be created.  This tabulation is followed by an indication of how long the
       coincidence table will be.  If the table is extremely long, the user may decide that viewing it is not so
       important after all, and may cancel the request at this point.  Assuming the user continues, <u>r.coin</u>  then
       allows  the user to choose one of eight units of measure in which the report results can be given.  These
       units are:

           •   c: cells

           •   p: percent cover of region

           •   x: percent of &lt;map name&gt; category (column)

           •   y: percent of &lt;map name&gt; category (row)

           •   a: acres

           •   h: hectares

           •   k: square kilometers

           •   m: square miles

       Note that three of these options give results as percentage values:  "p" is  based  on  the  grand  total
       number  of cells; "x" is based on only column totals; and "y" is based on only row totals.  Only one unit
       of measure can be selected per report output.  Type in just one of the  letters  designating  a  unit  of
       measure  followed  by  a &lt;RETURN&gt;.  The report will be printed to the screen for review.  After reviewing
       the report on the screen, the user is given several options.  The report may be saved to  a  file  and/or
       sent  to  a  printer.  If printed, it may be printed with either 80 or 132 columns.  Finally, the user is
       given the option to rerun the coincidence tabulation using a different unit of measurement.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       It is <b>not</b> a good idea to run <u>r.coin</u> on a map layer which has a  monstrous  number  of  categories  (e.g.,
       unreclassed  elevation).  Because <u>r.coin</u> reports information for each and every category, it is better to
       reclassify those categories (using <u>r.reclass</u>) into a more manageable number prior to  running  <u>r.coin</u>  on
       the reclassed raster map layer.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Below  is  a  sample of tabular output produced by <u>r.coin</u>.  Here, map output is stated in units of square
       miles.  The report tabulates the coincidence of the Spearfish sample database’s <u>owner</u> and <u>road</u> raster map
       layers’ categories.  The <u>owner</u> categories in this case refer to whether the  land  is  in  private  hands
       (category 1) or is owned by the U.S. Forest Service (category 2). The <u>roads</u> map layer categories refer to
       various  types  of  roads (with the exception of category value "0", which indicates "no data"; i.e., map
       locations at which no roads exist).  <u>r.coin</u> does not report category labels. The user should run <u>r.report</u>
       or <u>r.category</u> to obtain this information.

       The body of the report is arranged in panels. The map layer with the most categories  is  arranged  along
       the  vertical  axis  of  the  table; the other, along the horizontal axis.  Each panel has a maximum of 5
       categories (9 if printed) across the top. In addition, the last two columns reflect a cross total of each
       column for each row.  All of the categories of the  map  layer  arranged  along  the  vertical  axis  are
       included  in  each  panel.  There is a total at the bottom of each column representing the sum of all the
       rows in that column. A second total represents the sum of all the non-zero category rows. A  cross  total
       (Table Row Total) of all columns for each row appears in a separate panel.

       Note how the following information may be obtained from the sample report.

       In the Spearfish data base, in area not owned by the Forest Service, there are 50.63 square miles of land
       not used for roads. Roads make up 9.27 square miles of land in this area.

       Of the total 102.70 square miles in Spearfish, 42.80 square miles is owned by the Forest Service.
       In total, there are 14.58 square miles of roads.

       There  are more category 2 roads outside Forest Service land (2.92 mi. sq.)  than there are inside Forest
       land boundaries (0.72 mi. sq.).

       Following is a sample report.

       <u>r.coin</u> calculates the coincidence of two raster map layers.  Although <u>r.coin</u> allows the user to rerun the
       report using different units, it is not possible to simply rerun the report with  different  map  layers.
       In order to choose new map layers, it is necessary to rerun <u>r.coin.</u>
