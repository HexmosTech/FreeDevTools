</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rubber-info - extract information from LaTeX documents

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rubber-info</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>action</u>] <u>source</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Rubber-info  is  a utility for extracting various kinds of information from a LaTeX document. Information
       can be extracted from the source (for instance when calculating dependencies) or from the compilation log
       files (to extract errors and  warnings).  This  program  is  a  complement  for  the  compilation  system
       <b><a href="../man1/rubber.1.html">rubber</a></b>(1).

       The command-line options are those used by <b><a href="../man1/rubber.1.html">rubber</a></b>(1) plus one of the actions described below.

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       One  of  the following command-line options must be specified, to decide which information to extract. Of
       course, for actions that read a log file, a compilation must have been done  before.  If  none  of  these
       actions is specified, <u>--check</u> is assumed.

       <b>--boxes</b>
              Extracts from the log file the places in the source where bad boxes appeared (these are the famous
              overfull and underfull \hbox and \vbox)

       <b>--check</b>
              Report  errors if there are any, otherwise report undefined references if there are any, otherwise
              list warnings and bad boxes. This is the default action.

       <b>--deps</b> Analyse the source files and produce a space-separated list of all the  files  that  the  document
              depends on and that Rubber cannot rebuild.

       <b>--errors</b>
              Extract from the log file the list of errors that occurred during the last compilation.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display the list of all available options and exit nicely.

       <b>--refs</b> Report  the list of undefined or multiply defined references (i.e. the \ref's that are not defined
              by one \label).

       <b>--rules</b>
              Analyse the source files and produce a list of dependency rules. One rule  is  produced  for  each
              intermediate  target  that would be made when running <b>rubber</b>.  Rules are formatted in the style of
              Makefiles.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the version number and exit nicely.

       <b>--warnings</b>
              Stupidly enumerate all LaTeX warnings, i.e. all the lines in the log file that contain the  string
              "Warning".

       This  page  documents  Rubber  version  1.6.7.   The  program and this man-page are maintained by Florian
       Schmaus  &lt;<a href="mailto:flo@geekplace.eu">flo@geekplace.eu</a>&gt;.   The  homepage  for  Rubber  can  be  found  at   https://gitlab.com/latex-
       rubber/rubber.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The full documentation for <b>rubber</b> is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the <b>info</b> and <b>rubber</b> programs are
       properly installed at your site, the command

              <b>info</b> <b>rubber</b>

       should give you access to the complete manual.
