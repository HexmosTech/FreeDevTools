</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perlsecpolicy - Perl security report handling policy

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Perl project takes security issues seriously.

       The responsibility for handling security reports in a timely and effective manner has been delegated to a
       security team composed of a subset of the Perl core developers.

       This document describes how the Perl security team operates and how the team evaluates new security
       reports.

</pre><h4><b>REPORTING</b> <b>SECURITY</b> <b>ISSUES</b> <b>IN</b> <b>PERL</b></h4><pre>
       If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the Perl interpreter or modules maintained in
       the core Perl codebase, email the details to <a href="mailto:perl-security@perl.org">perl-security@perl.org</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:perl-security@perl.org">mailto:perl-security@perl.org</a>&gt;.
       This address is a closed membership mailing list monitored by the Perl security team.

       You should receive an initial response to your report within 72 hours.  If you do not receive a response
       in that time, please contact the Perl Steering Council &lt;<a href="mailto:steering-council@perl.org">mailto:steering-council@perl.org</a>&gt;.

       When members of the security team reply to your messages, they will generally include the
       <a href="mailto:perl-security@perl.org">perl-security@perl.org</a> address in the "To" or "CC" fields of the response. This allows all of the
       security team to follow the discussion and chime in as needed. Use the "Reply-all" functionality of your
       email client when you send subsequent responses so that the entire security team receives the message.

       The security team will evaluate your report and make an initial determination of whether it is likely to
       fit the scope of issues the team handles. General guidelines about how this is determined are detailed in
       the "WHAT ARE SECURITY ISSUES" section.

       If your report meets the team's criteria, an issue will be opened in the team's private issue tracker and
       you will be provided the issue's ID number.  Issue identifiers have the form perl-security#NNN. Include
       this identifier with any subsequent messages you send.

       The security team will send periodic updates about the status of your issue and guide you through any
       further action that is required to complete the vulnerability remediation process. The stages
       vulnerabilities typically go through are explained in the "HOW WE DEAL WITH SECURITY ISSUES" section.

</pre><h4><b>WHAT</b> <b>ARE</b> <b>SECURITY</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       A vulnerability is a behavior of a software system that compromises the system's expected
       confidentiality, integrity or availability protections.

       A security issue is a bug in one or more specific components of a software system that creates a
       vulnerability.

       Software written in the Perl programming language is typically composed of many layers of software
       written by many different groups. It can be very complicated to determine which specific layer of a
       complex real-world application was responsible for preventing a vulnerable behavior, but this is an
       essential part of fixing the vulnerability.

   <b>Software</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>security</b> <b>team</b>
       The Perl security team handles security issues in:

       •   The Perl interpreter

       •   The Perl modules shipped with the interpreter that are developed in the core Perl repository

       •   The command line tools shipped with the interpreter that are developed in the core Perl repository

       Files  under  the  <u>cpan/</u> directory in Perl's repository and release tarballs are developed and maintained
       independently. The Perl security team does not directly handle security issues  for  these  modules,  but
       since  this  code  is  bundled  with  Perl,  we  will  assist  in  forwarding  the  issue to the relevant
       maintainer(s) and you can still report these issues to us in secrecy.

   <b>Bugs</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> <b>security</b> <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>Perl</b>
       Perl is designed to be a fast and flexible general purpose programming language. The Perl interpreter and
       Perl modules make writing safe and secure applications easy, but they do have limitations.

       As a general rule, a bug in Perl needs to meet all of the following criteria to be considered a  security
       issue:

       •   The vulnerable behavior is not mentioned in Perl's documentation or public issue tracker.

       •   The vulnerable behavior is not implied by an expected behavior.

       •   The vulnerable behavior is not a generally accepted limitation of the implementation.

       •   The vulnerable behavior is likely to be exposed to attack in otherwise secure applications written in
           Perl.

       •   The  vulnerable  behavior  provides  a  specific  tangible  benefit  to an attacker that triggers the
           behavior.

   <b>Bugs</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> <b>security</b> <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>Perl</b>
       There are certain categories of bugs that are frequently reported to the security team that do  not  meet
       the criteria listed above.

       The following is a list of commonly reported bugs that are not handled as security issues.

       <u>Feeding</u> <u>untrusted</u> <u>code</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>interpreter</u>

       The  Perl parser is not designed to evaluate untrusted code.  If your application requires the evaluation
       of untrusted code, it should rely on an operating system level sandbox for its security.

       <u>Stack</u> <u>overflows</u> <u>due</u> <u>to</u> <u>excessive</u> <u>recursion</u>

       Excessive recursion is often caused by code that does not enforce limits on inputs. The Perl  interpreter
       assumes limits on recursion will be enforced by the application.

       <u>Out</u> <u>of</u> <u>memory</u> <u>errors</u>

       Common  Perl  constructs  such  as  "pack",  the  "x"  operator,  and  regular expressions accept numeric
       quantifiers that control how much memory will be allocated to store intermediate values or  results.   If
       you  allow an attacker to supply these quantifiers and consume all available memory, the Perl interpreter
       will not prevent it.

       <u>Escape</u> <u>from</u> <u>a</u> <u>Safe</u> <u>compartment</u>

       Opcode restrictions and Safe compartments are not supported as security mechanisms. The  Perl  parser  is
       not designed to evaluate untrusted code.

       <u>Use</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>"p"</u> <u>and</u> <u>"P"</u> <u>pack</u> <u>templates</u>

       These templates are unsafe by design.

       <u>Stack</u> <u>not</u> <u>reference-counted</u> <u>issues</u>

       These  bugs  typically  present  as use-after-free errors or as assertion failures on the type of a "SV".
       Stack not reference-counted crashes usually occur because code is both modifying a reference or glob  and
       using the values referenced by that glob or reference.

       This  type  of  bug is a long standing issue with the Perl interpreter that seldom occurs in normal code.
       Examples of this type of bug generally assume that attacker-supplied code will be evaluated by  the  Perl
       interpreter.

       <u>Thawing</u> <u>attacker-supplied</u> <u>data</u> <u>with</u> <u>Storable</u>

       Storable  is  designed  to  be  a  very  fast  serialization  format.   It is not designed to be safe for
       deserializing untrusted inputs.

       <u>Using</u> <u>attacker</u> <u>supplied</u> <u>SDBM_File</u> <u>databases</u>

       The SDBM_File module is not intended for use with untrusted SDBM databases.

       <u>Badly</u> <u>encoded</u> <u>UTF-8</u> <u>flagged</u> <u>scalars</u>

       This type of bug occurs when the ":utf8" PerlIO layer is used  to  read  badly  encoded  data,  or  other
       mechanisms are used to directly manipulate the UTF-8 flag on an SV.

       A  badly encoded UTF-8 flagged SV is not a valid SV. Code that creates SV's in this fashion is corrupting
       Perl's internal state.

       <u>Issues</u> <u>that</u> <u>exist</u> <u>only</u> <u>in</u> <u>blead,</u> <u>or</u> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>release</u> <u>candidate</u>

       The blead branch and Perl release candidates do not receive security support. Security defects  that  are
       present  only in pre-release versions of Perl are handled through the normal bug reporting and resolution
       process.

       <u>CPAN</u> <u>modules</u> <u>or</u> <u>other</u> <u>Perl</u> <u>project</u> <u>resources</u>

       The Perl security team is focused on the Perl  interpreter  and  modules  maintained  in  the  core  Perl
       codebase.  The team has no special access to fix CPAN modules, applications written in Perl, Perl project
       websites, Perl mailing lists or the Perl IRC servers.

       <u>Emulated</u> <u>POSIX</u> <u>behaviors</u> <u>on</u> <u>Windows</u> <u>systems</u>

       The Perl interpreter attempts to emulate "fork", "system", "exec" and other POSIX  behaviors  on  Windows
       systems.  This  emulation has many quirks that are extensively documented in Perl's public issue tracker.
       Changing these behaviors would cause significant disruption for existing users on Windows.

   <b>Bugs</b> <b>that</b> <b>require</b> <b>special</b> <b>categorization</b>
       Some bugs in the Perl interpreter occur in areas of the codebase that are  both  security  sensitive  and
       prone to failure during normal usage.

       <u>Regular</u> <u>expressions</u>

       Untrusted  regular  expressions are generally safe to compile and match against with several caveats. The
       following behaviors of Perl's regular expression engine are the developer's responsibility to constrain.

       The evaluation of untrusted regular expressions while "use re 'eval';" is in effect is never safe.

       Regular expressions are not guaranteed to compile or evaluate in any specific finite time frame.

       Regular expressions may consume all available system memory when they are compiled or evaluated.

       Regular expressions may cause excessive recursion that halts the perl interpreter.

       As a general rule, do not expect Perl's regular expression engine to be resistant to  denial  of  service
       attacks.

       <u>DB_File,</u> <u>ODBM_File,</u> <u>or</u> <u>GDBM_File</u> <u>databases</u>

       These modules rely on external libraries to interact with database files.

       Bugs  caused  by  reading  and  writing these file formats are generally caused by the underlying library
       implementation and are not security issues in Perl.

       Bugs where Perl mishandles unexpected valid return values from the underlying libraries  may  qualify  as
       security issues in Perl.

       <u>Algorithmic</u> <u>complexity</u> <u>attacks</u>

       The perl interpreter is reasonably robust to algorithmic complexity attacks. It is not immune to them.

       Algorithmic complexity bugs that depend on the interpreter processing extremely large amounts of attacker
       supplied data are not generally handled as security issues.

       See "Algorithmic Complexity Attacks" in perlsec for additional information.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>WE</b> <b>DEAL</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>SECURITY</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       The  Perl security team follows responsible disclosure practices. Security issues are kept secret until a
       fix is readily available for most users. This minimizes inherent risks users face from vulnerabilities in
       Perl.

       Hiding problems from the users temporarily is a necessary trade-off to keep them  safe.  Hiding  problems
       from users permanently is not the goal.

       When  you report a security issue privately to the <a href="mailto:perl-security@perl.org">perl-security@perl.org</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:perl-security@perl.org">mailto:perl-security@perl.org</a>&gt;
       contact address, we normally expect you to follow responsible disclosure practices in the handling of the
       report. If you are unable or unwilling to keep the issue secret until a fix is  available  to  users  you
       should state this clearly in the initial report.

       The  security  team's  vulnerability  remediation  workflow  is intended to be as open and transparent as
       possible about the state of your security report.

   <b>Perl's</b> <b>vulnerability</b> <b>remediation</b> <b>workflow</b>
       <u>Initial</u> <u>contact</u>

       New vulnerability reports will receive an initial reply within 72 hours from the time they arrive at  the
       security  team's mailing list. If you do not receive any response in that time, contact the Perl Steering
       Council &lt;<a href="mailto:steering-council@perl.org">mailto:steering-council@perl.org</a>&gt;.

       The initial response sent by the security team will confirm your message  was  received  and  provide  an
       estimated time frame for the security team's triage analysis.

       <u>Initial</u> <u>triage</u>

       The security team will evaluate the report and determine whether or not it is likely to meet the criteria
       for handling as a security issue.

       The  security team aims to complete the initial report triage within two weeks' time. Complex issues that
       require significant discussion or research may take longer.

       If the security report cannot be reproduced or does not meet  the  team's  criteria  for  handling  as  a
       security issue, you will be notified by email and given an opportunity to respond.

       <u>Issue</u> <u>ID</u> <u>assignment</u>

       Security  reports that pass initial triage analysis are turned into issues in the security team's private
       issue tracker. When a report progresses to this point you will  be  provided  the  issue  ID  for  future
       reference. These identifiers have the format perl-security#NNN or Perl/perl-security#NNN.

       The assignment of an issue ID does not confirm that a security report represents a vulnerability in Perl.
       Many reports require further analysis to reach that determination.

       Issues  in  the  security  team's private tracker are used to collect details about the problem and track
       progress towards a resolution. These notes and other details are  not  made  public  when  the  issue  is
       resolved.  Keeping  the  issue  notes  private allows the security team to freely discuss attack methods,
       attack tools, and other related private issues.

       <u>Development</u> <u>of</u> <u>patches</u>

       Members of the security team will inspect the report and related code in  detail  to  produce  fixes  for
       supported versions of Perl.

       If  the  team discovers that the reported issue does not meet the team's criteria at this stage, you will
       be notified by email and given an opportunity to respond before the issue is closed.

       The team may discuss potential fixes with you or provide you with patches  for  testing  purposes  during
       this time frame. No information should be shared publicly at this stage.

       <u>CVE</u> <u>ID</u> <u>assignment</u>

       Once an issue is fully confirmed and a potential fix has been found, the security team will request a CVE
       identifier for the issue to use in public announcements.

       Details  like the range of vulnerable Perl versions and identities of the people that discovered the flaw
       need to be collected to submit the CVE ID request.

       The security team may ask you to clarify the exact name we should use when  crediting  discovery  of  the
       issue. The "Vulnerability credit and bounties" section of this document explains our preferred format for
       this credit.

       Once  a  CVE  ID  has  been  assigned,  you  will  be notified by email.  The vulnerability should not be
       discussed publicly at this stage.

       <u>Pre-release</u> <u>notifications</u>

       When the security team is satisfied that the fix for a security issue is ready  to  release  publicly,  a
       pre-release notification announcement is sent to the major redistributors of Perl.

       This pre-release announcement includes a list of Perl versions that are affected by the flaw, an analysis
       of  the  risks to users, patches the security team has produced, and any information about mitigations or
       backporting fixes to older versions of Perl that the security team has available.

       The pre-release announcement will include a specific  target  date  when  the  issue  will  be  announced
       publicly.  The time frame between the pre-release announcement and the release date allows redistributors
       to prepare and test their own updates and announcements. During this period the vulnerability details and
       fixes are embargoed and should not be shared publicly. This embargo period may  be  extended  further  if
       problems are discovered during testing.

       You  will  be  sent the portions of pre-release announcements that are relevant to the specific issue you
       reported. This email will include the target release date. Additional updates will be sent if the  target
       release date changes.

       <u>Pre-release</u> <u>testing</u>

       The Perl security team does not directly produce official Perl releases. The team releases security fixes
       by placing commits in Perl's public git repository and sending announcements.

       Many  users  and  redistributors  prefer  using official Perl releases rather than applying patches to an
       older release. The security team works with Perl's release managers to make this possible.

       New official releases of Perl are generally produced and tested on private systems during the pre-release
       embargo period.

       <u>Release</u> <u>of</u> <u>fixes</u> <u>and</u> <u>announcements</u>

       At the end of the embargo period the security fixes will be committed to Perl's public git repository and
       announcements will be sent to the perl5-porters &lt;https://lists.perl.org/list/perl5-porters.html&gt; and oss-
       security &lt;https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security&gt; mailing lists.

       If official Perl releases are  ready,  they  will  be  published  at  this  time  and  announced  on  the
       perl5-porters &lt;https://lists.perl.org/list/perl5-porters.html&gt; mailing list.

       The  security  team  will  send a follow-up notification to everyone that participated in the pre-release
       embargo period once the release process is finished.  Vulnerability  reporters  and  Perl  redistributors
       should  not  publish  their  own announcements or fixes until the Perl security team's release process is
       complete.

   <b>Publicly</b> <b>known</b> <b>and</b> <b>zero-day</b> <b>security</b> <b>issues</b>
       The security team's vulnerability remediation workflow assumes that issues  are  reported  privately  and
       kept  secret  until  they are resolved. This isn't always the case and information occasionally leaks out
       before a fix is ready.

       In these situations the team must decide whether operating in secret increases or decreases the  risk  to
       users  of  Perl.  In  some  cases  being open about the risk a security issue creates will allow users to
       defend against it, in other cases calling attention to an unresolved security issue  will  make  it  more
       likely to be misused.

       <u>Zero-day</u> <u>security</u> <u>issues</u>

       If  an unresolved critical security issue in Perl is being actively abused to attack systems the security
       team will send out announcements as rapidly as possible with any mitigations the team has available.

       Perl's public defect tracker will be used to handle the issue so that additional information, fixes,  and
       CVE IDs are visible to affected users as rapidly as possible.

       <u>Other</u> <u>leaks</u> <u>of</u> <u>security</u> <u>issue</u> <u>information</u>

       Depending  on  the  prominence of the information revealed about a security issue and the issue's risk of
       becoming a zero-day attack, the security team may skip all or part of its normal remediation workflow.

       If the security team learns of a significant security issue after it has been identified and resolved  in
       Perl's public issue tracker, the team will request a CVE ID and send an announcement to inform users.

   <b>Vulnerability</b> <b>credit</b> <b>and</b> <b>bounties</b>
       The Perl project appreciates the effort security researchers invest in making Perl safe and secure.

       Since much of this work is hidden from the public, crediting researchers publicly is an important part of
       the vulnerability remediation process.

       <u>Credits</u> <u>in</u> <u>vulnerability</u> <u>announcements</u>

       When  security  issues are fixed we will attempt to credit the specific researcher(s) that discovered the
       flaw in our announcements.

       Credits are announced using the researcher's preferred full name.

       If the researcher's contributions were funded by a specific company or part of an organized vulnerability
       research project, we will include a short name for this group at the researcher's request.

       Perl's announcements are written in the English language  using  the  7bit  ASCII  character  set  to  be
       reproducible  in  a  variety of formats. We do not include hyperlinks, domain names or marketing material
       with these acknowledgments.

       In the event that proper credit  for  vulnerability  discovery  cannot  be  established  or  there  is  a
       disagreement  between  the Perl security team and the researcher about how the credit should be given, it
       will be omitted from announcements.

       <u>Bounties</u> <u>for</u> <u>Perl</u> <u>vulnerabilities</u>

       The Perl project is a non-profit volunteer effort. We do not provide any monetary rewards  for  reporting
       security issues in Perl.
