</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       aleph - extended Unicode TeX

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>aleph</b> [<u>options</u>] [<b>&amp;</b><u>format</u>] [<u>file</u>|<b>\</b><u>commands</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Run  the  Aleph  typesetter  on  <u>file</u>, usually creating <u>file.dvi</u>.  If the file argument has no extension,
       ".tex" will be appended to it.  Instead of a filename, a set of Aleph commands can be given, the first of
       which must start with a backslash.  With a <b>&amp;</b><u>format</u> argument Aleph uses a  different  set  of  precompiled
       commands, contained in <u>format</u><b>.fmt</b>; it is usually better to use the <b>-fmt</b> <u>format</u> option instead.

       Aleph  is  a  version of the TeX program modified for multilingual typesetting.  It uses Unicode, and has
       additional primitives for (among other things) bidirectional typesetting.

       Aleph's command line options are similar to those of TeX.

       Aleph is no longer being actively developed; see LuaTeX for current activity.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Run aleph --help to see the complete list of options; this is not exhaustive.

       <b>-cnf-line</b> <u>string</u>
              Parse <u>string</u> as a <u>texmf.cnf</u> configuration line.  See the Kpathsea manual.

       <b>--fmt</b> <u>format</u>
              Use <u>format</u> as the name of the format to be used, instead of the name by which Aleph was called  or
              a <u>%&amp;</u> line.

       <b>--halt-on-error</b>
              Exit with an error code when an error is encountered during processing.

       <b>--help</b> Print help message and exit.

       <b>--ini</b>  Be  `initial'  Aleph  for  dumping  formats;  this  is implicitly true if the program is called as
              <b>inialeph</b>.

       <b>--interaction</b> <u>mode</u>
              Sets the interaction mode.  The mode  can  be  one  of  <u>batchmode</u>,  <u>nonstopmode</u>,  <u>scrollmode</u>,  and
              <u>errorstopmode</u>.  The meaning of these modes is the same as that of the corresponding \commands.

       <b>--ipc</b>  Send DVI output to a socket as well as the usual output file.  Whether this option is available is
              the choice of the installer.

       <b>--ipc-start</b>
              As <b>--ipc</b>, and starts the server at the other end as well.  Whether this option is available is the
              choice of the installer.

       <b>--kpathsea-debug</b> <u>bitmask</u>
              Sets  path  searching  debugging  flags  according  to  the  bitmask.  See the <u>Kpathsea</u> manual for
              details.

       <b>--maketex</b> <u>fmt</u>
              Enable mktex<u>fmt</u>, where <u>fmt</u> must be one of <u>tex</u> or <u>tfm</u>.

       <b>--no-maketex</b> <u>fmt</u>
              Disable mktex<u>fmt</u>, where <u>fmt</u> must be one of <u>tex</u> or <u>tfm</u>.

       <b>--output-comment</b> <u>string</u>
              Use <u>string</u> for the DVI file comment instead of the date.

       <b>--output-directory</b> <u>directory</u>
              Write output files in <u>directory</u> instead  of  the  current  directory.   Look  up  input  files  in
              <u>directory</u> first, then along the normal search path.

       <b>--parse-first-line</b>
              If the first line of the main input file begins with <u>%&amp;</u> parse it to look for a dump name.

       <b>--progname</b> <u>name</u>
              Pretend to be program <u>name</u>.  This affects both the format used and the search paths.

       <b>--recorder</b>
              Enable  the  filename recorder.  This leaves a trace of the files opened for input and output in a
              file with extension <u>.ofl</u>.  (This option is always on.)

       <b>--shell-escape</b>
              Enable the <b>\write18{</b><u>command</u><b>}</b> construct.  The <u>command</u> can be any Bourne shell command.  By default,
              this construct is enabled in a restricted mode, for security reasons.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print version information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       See the Kpathsearch library documentation (the `Path specifications' node) for precise details of how the
       environment variables are used.  The <b>kpsewhich</b> utility can be used to query the values of the variables.

       One caveat: In most Aleph formats, you cannot use ~ in a filename you give directly to Aleph,  because  ~
       is  an  active character, and hence is expanded, not taken as part of the filename.  Other programs, such
       as Metafont, do not have this problem.

       <b>TEXMFOUTPUT</b>
              Normally, Aleph puts its output files in the current directory.  If  any  output  file  cannot  be
              opened  there,  it  tries  to  open  it  in  the  directory  specified in the environment variable
              TEXMFOUTPUT.  There is no default value for that variable.  For example, if you say <u>tex</u> <u>paper</u>  and
              the current directory is not writable, if TEXMFOUTPUT has the value <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>, Aleph attempts to create
              <u>/tmp/paper.log</u>  (and  <u>/tmp/paper.dvi</u>, if any output is produced.)  TEXMFOUTPUT is also checked for
              input files, as TeX often generates files that  need  to  be  subsequently  read;  for  input,  no
              suffixes (such as ``.tex'') are added by default, the input name is simply checked as given.

       <b>TEXINPUTS</b>
              Search  path  for  <u>\input</u> and <u>\openin</u> files.  This should start with ``.'', so that user files are
              found before system files.  An empty path component will be replaced with the paths defined in the
              <u>texmf.cnf</u> file.  For  example,  set  TEXINPUTS  to  ".:/home/user/tex:"  to  prepend  the  current
              directory and ``/home/user/tex'' to the standard search path.

       <b>TEXEDIT</b>
              Command template for switching to editor.  The default, usually <b>vi</b>, is set when Aleph is compiled.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of Aleph can
       be found in the info manual <u>Web2C:</u> <u>A</u> <u>TeX</u> <u>implementation</u>.  See <a href="http://tug/org/web2c">http://tug/org/web2c</a>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This  version  of  Aleph  implements  a number of optional extensions.  In fact, many of these extensions
       conflict to a greater or lesser extent with the definition of Aleph.  When such extensions  are  enabled,
       the banner printed when Aleph starts is changed to print <b>Alephk</b> instead of <b>Aleph</b>.

       This  version  of Aleph fails to trap arithmetic overflow when dimensions are added or subtracted.  Cases
       where this occurs are rare, but when it does the generated <u>DVI</u> file will be invalid.
