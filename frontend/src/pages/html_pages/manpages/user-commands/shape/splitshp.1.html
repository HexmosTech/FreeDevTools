</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       splitshp - Split Shape into frames or combine frames into Shapes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>splitshp</b> <u>SHAPE</u> <u>FRAME</u>...

       <b>splitshp</b> <u>SHAPE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Shape  files  are  used  for storage of all visible elements (from UI buttons to terrain features) of the
       games <u>Exult</u> supports. Shapes contain one or more frames.  <b>splitshp</b> can be used to combine frames into one
       file, or split a Shape file into its component frames.

       The mode of operation is determined by looking at  the  number  of  commandline  arguments.  Exactly  one
       argument means splitting, more than one argument signals a combining operation.

   <b>Combining</b>
       Each  <u>FRAME</u>  names  a  Shape  file  typically  consisting  of only one frame (i.e.  subsequent frames are
       ignored). All these frames are concatenated and written to the Shape file <u>SHAPE</u>.

   <b>Splitting</b>
       <u>SHAPE</u> will be read and split into its component frames. Each of those will be written to  its  own  Shape
       file.  The  names  of  these  files  are  determined by splitting the name of <u>SHAPE</u> before the last dot â€”
       anything before this dot is the <u>STEM</u>, anything else (including the dot) is the <u>PREFIX</u>, which may be empty
       in case there is no dot in the name. The output files are then named <u>STEM_nnSUFFIX</u> with  <u>nn</u>  replaced  by
       the frame number.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>splitshp</b> <b>button.shp</b> <b>button-up.shp</b> <b>button-down.shp</b>
              Packs the (first) two frames from <b>button-up.shp</b> and <b>button-down.shp</b> into the Shape file <b>button.shp</b>

       <b>splitshp</b> <b>grizzly</b>
              Unpacks  the  frames  contained  in  the  Shape  file  <b>grizzly</b> into the (single-frame) Shape files
              <b>grizzly_00</b>, <b>grizzly_01</b>, <b>grizzly_02</b>, etc.

       <b>splitshp</b> <b>boar.new.shp</b>
              Unpacks the frames contained in the Shape file <b>boar.new.shp</b> into the  (single-frame)  Shape  files
              <b>boar.new_00.shp</b>, <b>boar.new_01.shp</b>, <b>boar.new_02.shp</b>, etc.
