              Tab  completion next, previous.  Works for commands, nicks and quotes (when input line starts with
              <b>&gt;</b>).

       <b>ALT+1..Alt-0</b> or <b>F1..F10</b>
              Choose window 1..10.

       <b>ALT+q..Alt-p</b> (in QWERTY layout)
              Choose window 11..20.

       <b>ALT+LEFT</b>
              Choose previous chat window.

       <b>ALT+RIGHT</b>
              Choose next chat window.

       <b>PAGEUP</b> Page the active window up.

       <b>PAGEDOWN</b>
              Page the active window down.

       <b>ALT+PAGEUP</b>
              Page the occupants or roster panel up.

       <b>ALT+PAGEDOWN</b>
              Page the occupants or roster panel down.

       <b>ALT+v</b>  Mark current window for later reading with an attention flag.

       <b>ALT+m</b>  Switch between windows marked with the attention flag.

       <b>ALT+c</b>  Run external editor (see <b><a href="../man1/profanity-editor.1.html">profanity-editor</a></b>(1)) for current input line.

       <b>CTRL+DOWN</b>
              Store current input line in history but do not execute it.

       <u>Note:</u> Profanity is using GNU Readline library to handle input so default  configuration  file  <u><a href="file:~/.inputrc">~/.inputrc</a></u>
       affects  operation.  In  addition  to  that  <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/profanity/inputrc</u> is read after all default
       keybindigs are set so one can override or add settings there. For reference, see Readline  documentation:
       <u>info</u>  <u>readline</u>  <u>"Command</u>  <u>Line</u>  <u>Editing"</u> <u>"Readline</u> <u>Init</u> <u>File"</u> <u>"Readline</u> <u>Init</u> <u>File</u> <u>Syntax"</u> and the list of
       available Profanity commands in <u>inputwin.c</u>.  Standard Readline keybindings are supported,  including  <b>C-r</b>
       for interactive history search and <b>C-x</b> <b>C-r</b> for reloading inputrc without restart.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>PROFANITY</b></h4><pre>
       The user guide can be found at &lt;https://profanity-im.github.io/userguide.html&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>ENCRYPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Profanity supports various kinds of encryption: OMEMO, OTR, PGP, OX.  You can only enable one of them per
       correspondent at a time.

       <b>OMEMO</b>  OMEMO  (/omemo)  is  defined in XEP-0384. It uses an implementation of the Signal protocol for key
              management and to synchronize messages among different clients. It works even when  other  clients
              are offline. And offers Perfect Forward Secrecy and Plausible deniability. Servers need to support
              PEP  (XEP-0163).  We implement the "siacs" version of OMEMO. Version 0.3.0, which is currently the
              widest adopted option.  OMEMO is the only  encryption  option  in  Profanity  that  also  supports
              encryption for MUCs (XEP-0045) and file transfer via HTTP upload (XEP-0363).

       <b>OTR</b>    OTR  (/otr)  is defined in XEP-0364. It uses a combination of the AES symmetric-key algorithm, the
              Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange, and the SHA-1 hash function. It offers  deniable  authentication  and
              Perfect  Forward Secrecy. To initialize a session both clients need to be online at the same time.
              A session is between two clients, so multiclient chats are not working. Which is a feature  not  a
              bug. OTR does by design not work for MUCs.

       <b>OpenPGP</b>
              OpenPGP (/pgp) is defined in XEP-0027. Is uses a public and secret key. It is also known as Legacy
              OpenPGP  and  has  been deprecated. It doesn't provide protection against replay attacks. MUCs and
              file transfer via HTTP upload are not specified and thus not supported.

       <b>OX</b>     OX (/ox) is defined in XEP-0373 and XEP-0374. It's a more modern way to use OpenPGP  on  XMPP  and
              tries to fix the shortcomings of legacy XEP-0027. Servers need to support PEP (XEP-0163). MUCs and
              file transfer via HTTP upload are not specified and thus not supported.

       <b>DETAILS</b>
              For    more    details    read    the    relevant    XEPs    and   look   at   the   overview   at
              &lt;https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/XMPP_E2E_Security&gt;

</pre><h4><b>TERMINOLOGY</b></h4><pre>
       There is some XMPP specific terminology that might be unknown for fresh users. We will  try  to  describe
       them here since they are often references in the help and man pages.

       <b>JID</b>    Stands  for  Jabber  ID. It refers to an XMPP address. Historically XMPP was also known as Jabber.
              <b>MAM</b> Stands for Message Archive Management (XEP-0313) and describes the ability to  store  messages
              on  the  server  and retrieve them later.  <b>MUC</b> Stands for Mutli-User Chats (XEP-0045) and are also
              called, groups, group chats, chatrooms or conferences.  <b>Roster</b> The roster is your contact list. By
              default displayed at the right side on the console window. See RFC6121.  <b>XEP</b> XMPP is aa extendable
              protocol. There are core features and optional features described  in  XMPP  Extension  Protocols,
              short XEPs.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Profanity</b>  itself  has a lot of built-in help. Check the <u>/help</u> command for more information.  Type "/help
       help" for information on how to use help itself.  Profanity ships with one man  page  for  each  built-in
       command, e.g. there is <b><a href="../man1/profanity-account.1.html">profanity-account</a></b>(1) for <u>/account</u>.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration  for  <b>Profanity</b>  is  stored  in <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/profanity/profrc</u> , details on commands for
       configuring Profanity can be found at &lt;https://profanity-im.github.io/reference.html&gt; or  the  respective
       built-in help or man pages.
