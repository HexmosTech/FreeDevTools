       rnews - Inject individual articles and UUCP batches

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rnews</b> [<b>-abdNUv</b>] [<b>-h</b> <u>host</u>] [<b>-P</b> <u>port</u>] [<b>-rS</b> <u>server</u>] [<u>file</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rnews</b> injects either individual articles or UUCP-style article batches into a local or remote news
       server.  It submits articles via IHAVE and is suitable for injecting articles received from other
       sources; local postings should generally use <a href="../man1/inews.1.html">inews</a>(1) instead.  It is also used to process spooled
       messages created by, for example, <b>nnrpd</b> while <b>innd</b> is not available.

       If authentication credentials are present for the remote server in the <u>passwd.nntp</u> file in <u>pathetc</u>, then
       <b>rnews</b> will use them to authenticate.

       The message is read from <u>file</u> if given, spooled files (with the <b>-U</b> flag) or standard input if no file is
       given.  Articles are sent to the server given in the <b>-r</b> or <b>-S</b> command line options if given, otherwise to
       the server set via <u>nnrpdposthost</u> in <u>inn.conf</u>, otherwise to the local server at "127.0.0.1", and finally
       to the server set via <u>server</u> in <u>inn.conf</u>.

       When sent over UUCP, Usenet articles are typically collected in a single batch to reduce the UUCP
       overhead.  Batches can also be compressed to reduce communication time.  If the input to <b>rnews</b> does not
       begin with the characters "#!", it is taken to be a single news article; otherwise, the first line of the
       input is interpreted as a batch command.

       If the batch command is:

           #! rnews &lt;number&gt;

       then the next &lt;number&gt; bytes (starting with the next line) are read as a news article.  After that
       article is processed, the next line is again treated as a batch command.

       If the command is:

           #! cunbatch

       then the rest of the input is fed to "gzip -d" to uncompress it, and then the resulting uncompressed
       output is re-read as if it were the original input to <b>rnews</b>.  A compressed batch should therefore start
       with this line and contain a batch of articles separated by "#! rnews" lines and then compressed with
       <a href="../man1/compress.1.html">compress</a>(1).  (Batches compressed with <a href="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</a>(1) should instead use "gunbatch" as the batch command; INN
       just uses <b>gzip</b> rather than <b>compress</b> because it can handle <b>compress</b>-style compression but is more widely
       available, due to old patent issues, than <b>compress</b>.)

       Otherwise, if the command is any other word and the <b>-a</b> flag is not given, <b>rnews</b> will try to execute a
       program with that name, looking for it in the directory <u>pathbin</u>/rnews.libexec.  The rest of the batch
       will be fed to that program's standard input, and the standard output from the program will be treated as
       if it were the original input to <b>rnews</b>.  INN comes with three such standard batch processors:

       <b>bunbatch</b>
         It invokes <b>bzip2</b> and should be used for batches compressed with <b>bzip2</b>.

       <b>c7unbatch</b>
         It  undoes  an ASCII encoding to recover the original binary compressed stream and then decompresses it
         as explained above.

       <b>gunbatch</b>
         It invokes <b>gzip</b> and should be used for batches compressed with <b>gzip</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>  By default, <b>rnews</b> looks for additional unpackers in the <u>rnews.libexec</u> sub-directory  of  <u>pathbin</u>  (as
           set  in  <u>inn.conf</u>).   If  <b>-a</b>  is  given, no additional batch processor will be used; only "rnews" and
           "cunbatch" will be recognized as valid batch commands.

       <b>-b</b>  By default, <b>rnews</b> will log and discard any articles that are rejected by  the  server  or  cannot  be
           parsed  by <b>rnews</b> for some reason (such as a missing header field).  If <b>-b</b> is given, rejected articles
           will also be backed up in the <u>bad</u> sub-directory of <u>pathincoming</u> (as set in <u>inn.conf</u>).

       <b>-d</b>  If <b>-d</b> is given, <b>rnews</b> will log via syslog the message-ID and the  Path  header  field  body  of  each
           article rejected as a duplicate by the server.

       <b>-h</b> <u>host</u>
           If  <b>-h</b> is given, <b>rnews</b> will log the message ID and <u>host</u> via syslog for each article that it offers to
           the server.  This is used in conjunction with a UUCP feed to get a log of the messages  received  via
           that  feed.   This  will also be done if the environment variable UU_MACHINE is set, but will only be
           done if <u>host</u> is not an empty string.  (You can therefore turn off logging even if UU_MACHINE will  be
           set by passing the flag "-h ''" to <b>rnews</b>.)

       <b>-N</b>  Normally,  if  unpacking  the input batch fails, it is re-spooled to <u>pathincoming</u> for another attempt
           later.  If the <b>-N</b> flag is given, no such re-spooling is done and <b>rnews</b> will instead exit with  status
           9 if unpacking fails.

       <b>-P</b> <u>port</u>
           Use  <u>port</u> as the server port to connect to rather than <u>nnrpdpostport</u> (as set in <u>inn.conf</u>).  Note that
           this value is only used if <b>rnews</b> does not connect to the local server (in other words, when <b>-r</b> or  <b>-S</b>
           is given or <u>nnrpdposthost</u> is set).

       <b>-r</b> <u>server</u>, <b>-S</b> <u>server</u>
           <b>-r</b>  and <b>-S</b> are synonymous.  If either is given, articles will be sent to <u>server</u> rather than using the
           local server, overriding also the setting of <u>nnrpdposthost</u> in <u>inn.conf</u>.

       <b>-U</b>  If the server is not available,  both  <b>rnews</b>  and  <b>nnrpd</b>  will  spool  posts  to  new  files  in  the
           <u>pathincoming</u>  directory  (as  specified  in  <u>inn.conf</u>).  When <b>rnews</b> is invoked with the <b>-U</b> option, it
           scans that directory and processes all spooled messages found there whose filenames do not begin with
           ".", attempting to send them to the server again.  It's a good idea to run this periodically  out  of
           cron to pick up any articles spooled due to temporary server unavailability.

       <b>-v</b>  Enable  verbose  mode,  with more traces, notably logging the reason why articles are rejected by the
           server.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rnews</b> cannot process articles that have embedded null characters in them.  (Neither can the rest  of  INN
       at present.)
