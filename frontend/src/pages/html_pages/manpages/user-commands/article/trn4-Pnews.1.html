</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Pnews - a program for posting news articles

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Pnews</b> <b>newsgroup</b> <b>title</b>
         or
       <b>Pnews</b> <b>-h</b> <b>headerfile</b> <b>[oldarticle]</b>
         or
       <b>Pnews</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pnews  is  a friendly interface for posting news articles.  It will ask several questions, then allow you
       to enter your article, and then post it using the <a href="../man1/inews.1.html">inews</a>(1) program.  If you type h and a carriage  return
       at any point, <u>Pnews</u> will tell you what it wants to know.

       If  you  put  a <u>.signature</u> file in your home directory, your inews program will usually append it to your
       message after you are done editing it.  If you prefer to see your signature while you are editing, rename
       your .signature file to be .news_sig and it will be  appended  before  you  begin  to  edit.   Note  that
       .news_sig  obeys  the  setting of DOTDIR, but .signature may not, since it is out of Pnews's control.  If
       both .news_sig and .signature exist you'll get two signatures appended.

       The -h form is used when invoked from <u>trn</u> or <u>rn</u>.  If your editor can edit multiple files,  and  you  want
       the  article  to  which you are replying to show up as an alternate file, define the environment variable
       NEWSPOSTER as "Pnews -h %h %A".  You can also modify the the NEWSHEADER environment  variable  to  change
       the header file that <u>[t]rn</u> passes to Pnews.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       AUTHORCOPY
               If defined, contains the name of a file to which the finished article will be appended.

               Default: article not saved

       DOTDIR  Where  to  find  your  dot  files,  if they aren't in your home directory.  This is primarily for
               accounts which are shared by more than one person.

               Default: $HOME

       EDITOR  The editor you want to use, if VISUAL is undefined.

               Default: whatever your news administrator installed, usually vi.

       HOME    Your home directory.

               Default: $LOGDIR

       LOGDIR  Your home directory if HOME is undefined.

       LOGNAME Your login name, if USER is undefined.

               Default: value of "whoami".

       NAME    Your full name.

       NEWSORG Either the name of your organization, or  the  name  of  a  file  containing  the  name  of  your
               organization.  (For  use at organizations where the ORGANIZATION environmental variable is in use
               for  other  purposes).  If  both  NEWSORG  and  ORGANIZATION  are  set,  NEWSORG  will   override
               ORGANIZATION.

       ORGANIZATION
               Either  the  name  of  your  organization,  or  the  name  of  a file containing the name of your
               organization.

               Default: whatever your news administrator chose.
