</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       inews - Post an article to a news server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>inews</b> [<b>-ADEhHILNOPRSvVWXY</b>] [<b>-acdefFimnorstwx</b> <u>value</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>port</u>] [<u>file</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>inews</b> reads a Usenet news article, perhaps with headers, from <u>file</u> or standard input if no file is given.
       It adds some header fields and performs some consistency checks.  If the article does not meet those
       checks, the article is rejected.  If it passes the checks, <b>inews</b> sends the article to the news server
       specified in the <u>server</u> parameter in <u>inn.conf</u> or overridden by the "NNTPSERVER" environment variable when
       running <b>inews</b>.

       <b>inews</b> submits articles via POST and is suitable for posting articles that have not already been injecting
       into Usenet.  Submitting articles received from other sources should generally use <a href="../man1/rnews.1.html">rnews</a>(1) instead.

       By default, if a file named <u>.signature</u> exists in the home directory of the posting user, it is appended
       to the post, preceded by a line that contains only "-- ".  Signatures are not allowed to be more than
       four lines long.

       Control messages other than cancel messages are only allowed if <b>inews</b> is being run by the news user or by
       a user in the news group and if the control message is recognized.  If the article contains a
       Distribution header field with a distribution that matches one of the bad distribution patterns in
       <u>inn/options.h</u> (anything containing a period by default), the message will be rejected.  The message will
       also be rejected if <u>checkincludedtext</u> is true in <u>inn.conf</u>, it contains more quoted text than original
       text, and it is over 40 lines long.

       If not provided, the Path header field body will be "not-for-mail".  If <b>-x</b> is given, its value will be
       added to the beginning of the Path header field.  You may for instance want to add a special
       "path-identity" value related to the host running <b>inews</b>, which will appear as
       "path-identity!not-for-mail" in the Path header field.

       If posting fails, a copy of the failed post will be saved in a file named <u>dead.article</u> in the home
       directory of the user running <b>inews</b>.  <b>inews</b> exits with a non-zero status if posting failed or with a zero
       status if posting was successful.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Most of the options to <b>inews</b> take a single value and set the corresponding header field body in the
       message that is posted.  If the value is more than one word or contains any shell metacharacters, it must
       be quoted to protect it from the shell.  Here are all the options that set header fields and the
       corresponding header field body:

           -a  Approved
           -c  Control
           -d  Distribution
           -e  Expires
           -F  References
           -f  From
           -m  Message-ID
           -n  Newsgroups
           -o  Organization
           -r  Reply-To
           -t  Subject
           -w  Followup-To
           -x  Path (prefix)

       The <b>-x</b> argument will be added to the beginning of the normal Path header field body; it will not replace
       it contrary to what other options do.  This behaviour is historical, and was first implemented in the
       <b>inews</b> program shipped with B News (the original meaning of <b>-x</b> was to say not to forward the article to a
       specified site).

       <b>-A</b>, <b>-V</b>, <b>-W</b>
           Accepted for compatibility with C News.  These options have no affect.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>-I</b>, <b>-L</b>, <b>-s</b>, <b>-v</b>, <b>-X</b>
           Accepted  for  compatibility with <b>tinews.pl</b>, shipped with the news reader tin.  These options have no
           effect.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>-N</b>
           Perform the consistency checks and add header fields where appropriate, but then print the article to
           standard output rather than sending it to the server.  <b>-N</b> is accepted as as synonym for compatibility
           with C News.

       <b>-E</b>  If the article is empty (that is to say with no body), <b>inews</b> bails out with an  error.   When  <b>-E</b>  is
           used, <b>inews</b> will just silently discard the message and exit.

           Note that control messages with no body are not rejected.

       <b>-h</b>  Normally,  this  flag  should  always be given.  It indicates that the article consists of headers, a
           blank line, and then the message body.  If it is omitted, the input is taken to be just the  body  of
           the  message,  and  any  desired  header  fields  have  to  be specified with command-line options as
           described above.

       <b>-H</b>  Print to standard output a help message.

       <b>-O</b>  By default, an Organization header field will be added if none is present in the article.  To prevent
           adding the default (from <u>organization</u> in <u>inn.conf</u>), use this flag.

       <b>-p</b> <u>port</u>
           Connect to the specified port on the server rather than to the default (port 119).

       <b>-P</b>  <b>inews</b> computes a sender address with the username of the user running <b>inews</b> and the hostname  of  the
           news server.  It represents the actual poster of the article.

           By  default, a Sender header field will be added with that value if none is present in the article or
           if the From header field is not already set to that value.  Moreover, if a  Sender  header  field  is
           already present, it will be replaced with that value.

           To prevent adding or overwriting the Sender header field, use this flag.

       <b>-R</b>  Reject all control messages.

       <b>-S</b>  Do not attempt to append <u><a href="file:~/.signature">~/.signature</a></u> to the message, even if it exists.

       <b>-Y</b>  By  default,  <b>inews</b>  authenticates to the remote news server only if asked to, or if the initial NNTP
           banner corresponds to a state in which postings are not allowed.  Using  this  flag  leads  <b>inews</b>  to
           always authenticate, even if not asked to.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  examples  show  how  to post an article with headers and body, separated by a blank line,
       written in a file named <u>article</u>.

       To post it to the news server set in the <u>server</u> parameter of <u>inn.conf</u> (which can be "localhost" if it  is
       the local server), without adding a Sender header field:

           inews -h -P &lt; article

       To force "news.uu.net" as the server to send the article to:

          NNTPSERVER=news.uu.net inews -h -P &lt; article

       For testing purpose, to see the article that will be posted, without actually sending it but only writing
       it to the standard output:

           inews -h -P -D &lt; article

       If <u>article</u> only contains a message without headers, you may use:

           inews -t 'Hello' -n misc.test -f 'Bob &lt;<a href="mailto:bob@uu.net">bob@uu.net</a>&gt;' -P &lt; article

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  NNTP  server requests authentication, <b>inews</b> will try to read <u>passwd.nntp</u> to get the username and
       password to use and will therefore need read access to that file.  This is typically done by making  that
       file  group-readable  and  adding all users who should be able to use <b>inews</b> to post to that server to the
       appropriate group.

       <b>inews</b> used to do even more than it does now, and all of the remaining checks that are  not  dependent  on
       the user running <b>inews</b> should probably be removed in favor of letting the news server handle them.

       Since  INN's <b>inews</b> uses <u>inn.conf</u> and some other corners of an INN installation, it's not very appropriate
       as a general standalone <b>inews</b> program for general use on a system  that's  not  running  a  news  server.
       Other,  more  suitable  versions  of  <b>inews</b>  are  available  as  part  of various Unix news clients or by
       themselves.  We try to keep compatibility with the flags other implementations use (like C  News,  inews-
       xt,  and  the  still  actively maintained <b>tinews.pl</b> shipped with the news reader tin or downloadable from
       &lt;<a href="http://bzr.tin.org/tools/tinews.pl">http://bzr.tin.org/tools/tinews.pl</a>&gt; for a standalone use).
