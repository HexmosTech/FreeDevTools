</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       snow-chibi - Snow package manager

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>snow-chibi</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u> [<u>arguments</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Chibi  Scheme  comes  with  a  package  manager based on Snow2 which can be used to share R7RS libraries.
       Packages are distributed as tar gzipped files called "snowballs" and may contain multiple libraries.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Querying</b> <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> <b>status</b>
       By default snow-chibi looks for packages in the public repository, though you can customize this with the
       <b>--repo</b> option.  Packages can be browsed on the site, but you can also search and query from the  command-
       line tool.

       <b>search</b> <u>terms</u> ...
              Print a list of available packages matching the given keywords.

       <b>show</b> <u>names</u> ...
              Show  detailed  information for the listed packages, which can be sexp library names or the dotted
              shorthand used by Chibi Scheme.  For example,
              snow-chibi show "(chibi match)"
              can be shortened as
              snow-chibi show chibi.match

       <b>status</b> <u>names</u> ...
              Print the installed version of the given packages.  Uninstalled packages will not be shown.  If no
              names are given, prints all currently installed packages.

       <b>implementations</b>
              Print  the  currently  installed  Scheme  implementations  supported   by   <u>snow-chibi</u>.    If   an
              implementation is found but has an older version, a warning is printed.

   <b>Managing</b> <b>packages</b>
       The basic package management functionality, installing upgrading and removing packages.

       <b>install</b> <u>names</u> ...
              Install  the  given  packages.   Package  names  can  be  sexp  lists or use the dotted shorthand.
              Explicit names for packages are optional, as a package can always be referred to by  the  name  of
              any  library  it contains.  If multiple packages provide libraries with the same name, you will be
              asked to confirm which implementation to install.

              You can also bypass the repository and install a manually downloaded snowball by giving a path  to
              that file instead of a name.

       <b>upgrade</b> <u>names</u> ...
              Upgrade  the packages if new versions are available.  If no names are given, upgrades all eligible
              packages.

       <b>remove</b> <u>names</u> ...
              Uninstalls the given packages.  If the packages were not installed with <u>snow-chibi</u> they cannot  be
              removed.

       <b>update</b> <u>snow-chibi</u>  keeps  a  local  cache  of  the  remote  repository  and updates only periodically for
              performance, but you can force an update with this command.

       <b>index</b> <u>files</u> ...
              If you have installed a package manually you can use this command to move the package under  <u>snow-</u>
              <u>chibi</u> supervision.  Just pass the path to the package files containing the installed R7RS library.

   <b>Authoring</b> <b>packages</b>
       Creating  packages  can  be  done  with the <b>package</b> command, though other commands allow for uploading to
       public repositories.

       <b>package</b> <u>files</u> ...
              Create a package snowball from the given files, which should  be  R7RS  library  files  containing
              define-library  forms.   Include  files  are  inferred  and packaged automatically.  You can share
              packages directly, or upload them to a snow repository for easy automated install.

       <b>upload</b> <u>files</u> ...
              Sign and upload to the default snow host.  The files may either be .tgz package  files,  or  files
              containing  define-library  forms  as  in  the  <b>package</b> command, from which packages are generated
              automatically.  Before you can upload to the default host a key must be generated  and  registered
              first with the <b>gen-key</b> and <b>reg-key</b> commands.

       <b>gen-key</b>
              Create  a  new key, with your name, email address, and optionally an RSA public key pair (disabled
              by default in the current implementation).  The key is saved locally to <a href="file:~/.snow/priv-key.scm.">~/.snow/priv-key.scm.</a>  You
              need to register it with <b>reg-key</b> before it can be used for uploads.

       <b>reg-key</b>
              Register your key on the default Snow host.

       <b>sign</b> <u>file</u>
              Sign a file with your key and write it to the .sig file.  This can be used with the verify command
              for testing,  but  otherwise  is  not  needed  as  the  upload  command  generates  the  signature
              automatically.

       <b>verify</b> <u>sig-file</u>
              Print a message verifying if a signature is valid.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       <b>help</b>   Prints command-line reference.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

              This overrides the <b>CC</b> environment variable.

       <b>--cflags</b>=<u>flags</u>
              Additional flags for the C compiler.

              This overrides the <b>CFLAGS</b> environment variable.

              path.

       <b>--sexp</b> Output information in machine-readable sexp format instead of the default human-readable output.

</pre><h4><b>EASY</b> <b>PACKAGING</b></h4><pre>
       To  encourage  sharing  code  it's  important  to  make  it as easy as possible to create packages, while
       encouraging documentation and tests.  In particular, you  should  never  need  to  duplicate  information
       anywhere.   Thus  the <b>package</b> command automatically locates and packages include files (and data, and FFI
       files) and determines dependencies for you.  In addition, it can automatically handle versions, docs  and
       tests:

           •  version can come explicitly from the <b>--version</b> option, or the <b>--version-file=</b><u>file</u> option

           •  docs  can  come explicitly from the <b>--doc=</b><u>file</u> option, or be extracted automatically from literate
              documentation with <b>--doc-for-scribble</b>

           •  tests can come either explicitly from the <b>--test=</b><u>program</u> option,  or  the  <b>--test-library=</b><u>lib-name</u>
              which will generate a program to run just the run-tests thunk in that library

       Other useful meta-info options include:

       <b>--authors</b>
              comma-delimited list of the package authors

       <b>--maintainers</b>
              comma-delimited list of the package maintainers

       <b>--license</b>
              the package license

       These  three  are typically always the same, so it's useful to save them in your <a href="file:~/.snow/config.scm">~/.snow/config.scm</a> file.
       This file contains a single sexp and can specify any option, for example:

       ((repository-uri "<a href="http://alopeke.gr/repo.scm">http://alopeke.gr/repo.scm</a>")
        (command
         (package
          (authors "Socrates &lt;<a href="mailto:hemlock@aol.com">hemlock@aol.com</a>&gt;")
          (doc-from-scribble #t)
          (version-file "VERSION")
          (test-library (append-to-last -test))
          (license gpl))))

       Top-level snow options are represented as a flat alist.  Options specific to a command are  nested  under
       (command  (<u>name</u>  ...)), with most options here being for package.  Here unless overridden on the command-
       line, all packages will use the given author and license, try to extract literate  docs  from  the  code,
       look  for  a version in the file named "VERSION", and try to find a test suite with the same library name
       appended with -test; e.g. for the library (socratic method), the test library would be (socratic  method-
       test).  This form is an alternate to using an explicit test-library name, and encourages you to keep your
       tests  close to the code they test.  In the typical case, if using these conventions, you can thus simply
       run <b>snow-chibi</b> <b>package</b> <u>lib-file</u> without any other options.

       Use can use the <b>SNOW_CHIBI_CONFIG</b> environment variable to specify the  path  to  the  configuration  file
       explicitly, rather than using the default <a href="file:~/.snow/config.scm">~/.snow/config.scm</a>
