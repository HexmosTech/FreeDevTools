</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       csh — a shell (command interpreter) with C-like syntax

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>csh</b> [<b>-bcefimnstVvXx</b>] [<u>argument</u> <u>...</u>]
       <b>csh</b> [<b>-l</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>csh</b>  is  a  command language interpreter incorporating a history mechanism (see “History substitutions”),
       job control facilities (see “Jobs”), interactive file name and  user  name  completion  (see  “File  name
       completion”),  and  a  C-like  syntax.   It is used both as an interactive login shell and a shell script
       command processor.

   <b>Argument</b> <b>list</b> <b>processing</b>
       If the first argument (argument 0) to the shell is a dash (‘-’), then this is a  login  shell.   A  login
       shell also can be specified by invoking the shell with the <b>-l</b> flag as the only argument.

       The rest of the flag arguments are interpreted as follows:

       <b>-b</b>     This  flag  forces  a  “break”  from  option processing, causing any further shell arguments to be
              treated as non-option arguments.  The  remaining  arguments  will  not  be  interpreted  as  shell
              options.   This  may  be  used  to  pass  options  to a shell script without confusion or possible
              subterfuge.  The shell will not run a set-user-ID script without this option.

       <b>-c</b>     Commands are read from the (single) following argument  which  must  be  present.   Any  remaining
              arguments are placed in <u>argv</u>.

       <b>-e</b>     The shell exits if any invoked command terminates abnormally or yields a non-zero exit status.

       <b>-f</b>     The  shell will start faster, because it will not execute user or system startup files, load saved
              history or perform command hashing.  Note: if the environment  variable  HOME  is  not  set,  fast
              startup is the default.

       <b>-i</b>     The  shell  is  interactive  and  prompts  for its top-level input, even if it appears not to be a
              terminal.  Shells are interactive without this option if their inputs and outputs are terminals.

       <b>-l</b>     The shell is a login shell (only applicable if <b>-l</b> is the only flag specified).

       <b>-m</b>     Read <u>.cshrc</u>, regardless of its owner and group.  This option is dangerous and should only be  used
              by <u><a href="../man1/su.1.html">su</a></u>(1).

       <b>-n</b>     Commands  are  parsed,  but not executed.  This aids in syntactic checking of shell scripts.  When
              used interactively, the shell can be terminated by  pressing  control-D  (end-of-file  character),
              since <b>exit</b> will not work.

       <b>-s</b>     Command input is taken from the standard input.

       <b>-t</b>     A  single line of input is read and executed.  A backslash (‘\’) may be used to escape the newline
              at the end of this line and continue onto another line.

       <b>-V</b>     Causes the <u>verbose</u> variable to be set even before <u>.cshrc</u> is executed.

       <b>-v</b>     Causes the <u>verbose</u> variable to be set, with the effect that command input is echoed after  history
              substitution.

       <b>-X</b>     Causes the <u>echo</u> variable to be set even before <u>.cshrc</u> is executed.

       <b>-x</b>     Causes the <u>echo</u> variable to be set, so that commands are echoed immediately before execution.

       After  processing  of  flag arguments, if arguments remain but none of the <b>-c</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>-s</b>, or <b>-t</b> options were
       given, the first argument is taken as the name of a file of commands to be  executed.   The  shell  opens
       this  file,  and  saves  its name for possible resubstitution by ‘$0’.  Since many systems use either the
       standard version 6 or version 7 shells whose shell scripts are not compatible with this shell, the  shell
       will  execute  such a “standard” shell if the first character of a script is not a hash mark (‘#’); i.e.,
       if the script does not start with a comment.  Remaining arguments initialize the variable <u>argv</u>.

       An instance of <b>csh</b> begins by executing commands from the file <u>/etc/csh.cshrc</u> and,  if  this  is  a  login
       shell,  <u>/etc/csh.login</u>.  It then executes commands from <u>.cshrc</u> in the home directory of the invoker, and,
       if this is a login shell, the file <u>.login</u> in the same location.  It is typical for users on CRTs  to  put
       the command <b>stty</b> <b>crt</b> in their <u>.login</u> file, and to also invoke <u><a href="../man1/tset.1.html">tset</a></u>(1) there.

       In  the  normal  case,  the  shell  will  begin  reading commands from the terminal, prompting with ‘% ’.
       Processing of arguments and the use of the shell to process files  containing  command  scripts  will  be
       described later.

       The  shell  repeatedly  performs  the  following actions: a line of command input is read and broken into
       “words”.  This sequence of words is placed on the command history list and parsed.  Finally each  command
       in the current line is executed.

       When  a  login shell terminates, it executes commands from the files <u>.logout</u> in the user's home directory
       and <u>/etc/csh.logout</u>.

   <b>Lexical</b> <b>structure</b>
       The shell splits input lines into words at blanks and tabs with the following exceptions.  The characters
       ‘&amp;’, ‘|’, ‘;’, ‘&lt;’, ‘&gt;’, ‘(’, and ‘)’ form separate words.  If doubled in  ‘&amp;&amp;’,  ‘||’,  ‘&lt;&lt;’,  or  ‘&gt;&gt;’,
       these  pairs  form  single  words.   These parser metacharacters may be made part of other words, or have
       their special meaning prevented, by preceding them with a backslash (‘\’).  A newline preceded by  a  ‘\’
       is equivalent to a blank.

       Strings  enclosed  in matched pairs of quotations, ‘'’, ‘`’, or ‘"’, form parts of a word; metacharacters
       in these strings, including blanks and tabs, do not form separate words.  These quotations have semantics
       to be described later.  Within pairs of ‘'’ or ‘"’ characters, a newline preceded by a ‘\’ gives  a  true
       newline character.

       When  the  shell's  input is not a terminal, the character ‘#’ introduces a comment that continues to the
       end of the input line.  This special meaning is prevented when preceded by ‘\’ and  in  quotations  using
       ‘`’, ‘'’, and ‘"’.

   <b>Commands</b>
       A  simple  command  is  a  sequence of words, the first of which specifies the command to be executed.  A
       simple command or a sequence of simple commands separated by ‘|’ characters forms a pipeline.  The output
       of each command in a pipeline is connected to the input of the  next.   Sequences  of  pipelines  may  be
       separated  by  ‘;’,  and are then executed sequentially.  A sequence of pipelines may be executed without
       immediately waiting for it to terminate by following it with a ‘&amp;’.

       Any of the above may be placed in ‘(’ ‘)’ to form a  simple  command  (that  may  be  a  component  of  a
       pipeline, for example).  It is also possible to separate pipelines with ‘||’ or ‘&amp;&amp;’ showing, as in the C
       language,  that  the  second  is  to be executed only if the first fails or succeeds, respectively.  (See
       <u>Expressions</u>.)

   <b>Jobs</b>
       The shell associates a <u>job</u> with each pipeline.  It keeps a table of current jobs,  printed  by  the  <b>jobs</b>
       command,  and  assigns  them  small  integer numbers.  When a job is started asynchronously with ‘&amp;’, the
       shell prints a line that looks like:

             [1] 1234

       showing that the job which was started asynchronously was job number 1 and had one  (top-level)  process,
       whose process ID was 1234.

       If  you are running a job and wish to do something else you may hit <b>^Z</b> (control-Z), which sends a SIGSTOP
       signal to the current job.  The shell will then normally show that the job has been “Stopped”, and  print
       another  prompt.  You can then manipulate the state of this job, putting it in the <u>background</u> with the <b>bg</b>
       command, or run some other commands and eventually bring the job back into the  <u>foreground</u>  with  the  <b>fg</b>
       command.   A <b>^Z</b> takes effect immediately and is like an interrupt in that pending output and unread input
       are discarded when it is typed.  There is another special key <b>^Y</b> that does not generate a SIGSTOP  signal
       until  a program attempts to <u><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></u>(2) it.  This request can usefully be typed ahead when you have prepared
       some commands for a job that you wish to stop after it has read them.

       A job being run in the background will stop if it tries to read from the terminal.  Background  jobs  are
       normally  allowed  to produce output, but this can be disabled by giving the command <b>stty</b> <b>tostop</b>.  If you
       set this tty option, then background jobs will stop when they try to produce output  like  they  do  when
       they try to read input.

       There  are  several ways to refer to jobs in the shell.  The character ‘%’ introduces a job name.  If you
       wish to refer to job number 1, you can name it as ‘%1’.  Just naming a job brings it to  the  foreground;
       thus  <b>%1</b>  is a synonym for <b>fg</b> <b>%1</b>, bringing job number 1 back into the foreground.  Similarly, saying <b>%1</b> <b>&amp;</b>
       resumes job number 1 in the background.  Jobs can also be named by prefixes of the  string  typed  in  to
       start  them, if these prefixes are unambiguous; thus <b>%ex</b> would normally restart a suspended <u><a href="../man1/ex.1.html">ex</a></u>(1) job, if
       there were only one suspended job whose name began with the string "ex".  It  is  also  possible  to  say
       <b>%?string</b>, which specifies a job whose text contains <u>string</u>, if there is only one such job.

       The  shell maintains a notion of the current and previous jobs.  In output about jobs, the current job is
       marked with a ‘+’ and the previous job with a ‘-’.  The abbreviation ‘%+’ refers to the current  job  and
       ‘%-’  refers  to the previous job.  For close analogy with the syntax of the <b>history</b> mechanism (described
       below), ‘%%’ is also a synonym for the current job.

       The job control mechanism requires that the <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1) option <b>new</b> be set.  It is  an  artifact  from  a  <u>new</u>
       implementation of the tty driver that allows generation of interrupt characters from the keyboard to tell
       jobs to stop.  See <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1) for details on setting options in the new tty driver.

   <b>Status</b> <b>reporting</b>
       The  shell  learns  immediately whenever a process changes state.  It normally informs you whenever a job
       becomes blocked so that no further progress is possible, but only just before it prints a  prompt.   This
       is done so that it does not otherwise disturb your work.  If, however, you set the shell variable <u>notify</u>,
       the  shell  will  notify  you immediately of changes of status in background jobs.  There is also a shell
       command <b>notify</b> that marks a single process so that its status changes will be immediately  reported.   By
       default <b>notify</b> marks the current process; simply say <b>notify</b> after starting a background job to mark it.

       When  you try to leave the shell while jobs are stopped, you will be warned that “You have stopped jobs”.
       You may use the <b>jobs</b> command to see what they are.  If you try to exit again immediately, the shell  will
       not warn you a second time, and the suspended jobs will be terminated.

   <b>File</b> <b>name</b> <b>completion</b>
       When  the file name completion feature is enabled by setting the shell variable <u>filec</u> (see <b>set</b>), <b>csh</b> will
       interactively complete file names and user names from unique  prefixes  when  they  are  input  from  the
       terminal  followed  by  the escape character (the escape key, or control-[).  For example, if the current
       directory looks like

             DSC.OLD  bin      cmd      lib      xmpl.c
             DSC.NEW  chaosnet cmtest   mail     xmpl.o
             bench    class    dev      mbox     xmpl.out

       and the input is

             <b>%</b> <b>vi</b> <b>ch&lt;escape&gt;</b>

       <b>csh</b> will complete the prefix “ch” to the only matching file name “chaosnet”, changing the input line to

             <b>%</b> <b>vi</b> <b>chaosnet</b>

       However, given

             <b>%</b> <b>vi</b> <b>D&lt;escape&gt;</b>

       <b>csh</b> will only expand the input to

             <b>%</b> <b>vi</b> <b>DSC.</b>

       and will sound the terminal bell to indicate that the expansion is incomplete, since there are  two  file
       names matching the prefix ‘D’.

       If  a  partial  file  name is followed by the end-of-file character (usually control-D), then, instead of
       completing the name, <b>csh</b> will list all file names matching the prefix.  For example, the input

             <b>%</b> <b>vi</b> <b>D&lt;control-D&gt;</b>

       causes all files beginning with ‘D’ to be listed:

             <b>DSC.NEW</b>   <b>DSC.OLD</b>

       while the input line remains unchanged.

       The same system of escape and end-of-file can also be used to expand partial user names, if the  word  to
       be completed (or listed) begins with the tilde character (‘~’).  For example, typing

             <b>cd</b> <b>~ro&lt;escape&gt;</b>

       may produce the expansion

             <b>cd</b> <b>~root</b>

       The  use  of  the  terminal  bell  to  signal  errors or multiple matches can be inhibited by setting the
       variable <u>nobeep</u>.

       Normally, all files in the particular directory are candidates for name completion.  Files  with  certain
       suffixes can be excluded from consideration by setting the variable <u>fignore</u> to the list of suffixes to be
       ignored.  Thus, if <u>fignore</u> is set by the command

             <b>%</b> <b>set</b> <b>fignore</b> <b>=</b> <b>(.o</b> <b>.out)</b>

       then typing

             <b>%</b> <b>vi</b> <b>x&lt;escape&gt;</b>

       would result in the completion to

             <b>%</b> <b>vi</b> <b>xmpl.c</b>

       ignoring  the  files  "xmpl.o"  and  "xmpl.out".   However,  if the only completion possible requires not
       ignoring these suffixes, then they are not ignored.  In addition, <u>fignore</u> does not affect the listing  of
       file names by control-D.  All files are listed regardless of their suffixes.

   <b>Substitutions</b>
       We  now  describe  the various transformations the shell performs on the input in the order in which they
       occur.

   <b>History</b> <b>substitutions</b>
       History substitutions place words from previous command input as portions of new commands, making it easy
       to repeat commands, repeat arguments of a previous command  in  the  current  command,  or  fix  spelling
       mistakes  in  the  previous  command  with  little  typing  and  a  high  degree  of confidence.  History
       substitutions begin with the character ‘!’ and may begin <u>anywhere</u> in the input stream (with  the  proviso
       that  they  do  <u>not</u>  nest).   This  ‘!’  may  be  preceded  by  a ‘\’ to prevent its special meaning; for
       convenience, a ‘!’ character is passed unchanged when it is followed by a blank,  tab,  newline,  ‘=’  or
       ‘(’.   (History  substitutions  also occur when an input line begins with ‘^’.  This special abbreviation
       will be described later.)  Any input line that contains history substitution is echoed  on  the  terminal
       before it is executed as it would have been typed without history substitution.

       Commands  input  from  the terminal that consist of one or more words are saved on the history list.  The
       history substitutions reintroduce sequences of words from these saved commands  into  the  input  stream.
       The  size  of  the  history  list  is  controlled by the <u>history</u> variable; the previous command is always
       retained, regardless of the value of the history variable.  Commands are numbered sequentially from 1.

       For definiteness, consider the following output from the <b>history</b> command:

             09  write michael
             10  ex write.c
             11  cat oldwrite.c
             12  diff *write.c

       The commands are shown with their event numbers.  It is not usually necessary to use event  numbers,  but
       the current event number can be made part of the prompt by placing a ‘!’ in the prompt string.

       With  the  current event 13 we can refer to previous events by event number ‘!11’, relatively as in ‘!-2’
       (referring to the same event), by a prefix of a command word as in ‘!d’ for event 12 or ‘!wri’ for  event
       9,  or  by  a  string contained in a word in the command as in ‘!?mic?’ also referring to event 9.  These
       forms, without further change, simply reintroduce the words of the specified events, each separated by  a
       single blank.  As a special case, ‘!!’ refers to the previous command; thus ‘!!’ alone is a <u>redo</u>.

       To  select  words  from  an event we can follow the event specification by a ‘:’ and a designator for the
       desired words.  The words of an input line are numbered from 0, the first (usually command) word being 0,
       the second word (first argument) being 1, etc.  The basic word designators are:

             0       first (command) word
             <u>n</u>       <u>n</u>'th argument
             ^       first argument; i.e., ‘1’
             $       last argument
             %       word matched by (immediately preceding) ?<u>s</u>? search
             <u>x-y</u>     range of words
             <u>-y</u>      abbreviates ‘0-y’
             *       abbreviates ‘^-$’, or nothing if only 1 word in event
             <u>x*</u>      abbreviates ‘x-$’
             <u>x-</u>      like ‘x*’ but omitting word ‘$’

       The ‘:’ separating the event specification from the word  designator  can  be  omitted  if  the  argument
       selector  begins  with  a  ‘^’, ‘$’, ‘*’, ‘-’, or ‘%’.  After the optional word designator, a sequence of
       modifiers can be placed, each preceded by a ‘:’.  The following modifiers are defined:

             h       Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving the head.
             r       Remove a trailing ‘.xxx’ component, leaving the root name.
             e       Remove all but the extension ‘.xxx’ part.
             s<u>/l/r/</u>  Substitute <u>l</u> for <u>r</u>.
             t       Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.
             &amp;       Repeat the previous substitution.
             g       Apply the change once on each word, prefixing the above; e.g., ‘g&amp;’.
             a       Apply the change as many times as possible on a single word, prefixing the above.   It  can
                     be used together with ‘g’ to apply a substitution globally.
             p       Print the new command line but do not execute it.
             q       Quote the substituted words, preventing further substitutions.
             x       Like ‘q’, but break into words at blanks, tabs, and newlines.

       Unless  preceded  by a ‘g’, the change is applied only to the first modifiable word.  With substitutions,
       it is an error for no word to be applicable.

       The left-hand side of substitutions are not regular expressions in the sense of the editors, but  instead
       strings.  Any character may be used as the delimiter in place of ‘/’; a ‘\’ quotes the delimiter into the
       <u>l</u>  and <u>r</u> strings.  The character ‘&amp;’ in the right-hand side is replaced by the text from the left.  A ‘\’
       also quotes ‘&amp;’.  A NULL <u>l</u> (‘//’) uses the previous string either from an <u>l</u> or  from  a  contextual  scan
       string  <u>s</u>  in  ‘!?<u>s</u>\?’.   The  trailing delimiter in the substitution may be omitted if a newline follows
       immediately as may the trailing ‘?’ in a contextual scan.

       A history reference may be given without an event specification; e.g., ‘!$’.  Here, the reference  is  to
       the  previous  command  unless  a previous history reference occurred on the same line in which case this
       form repeats the previous reference.  Thus “!?foo?^ !$” gives the  first  and  last  arguments  from  the
       command matching “?foo?”.

       A  special abbreviation of a history reference occurs when the first non-blank character of an input line
       is a ‘^’.  This is equivalent to “!:s^” providing a convenient shorthand for substitutions on the text of
       the previous line.  Thus <b>^lb^lib</b> fixes the spelling of “lib” in the previous command.  Finally, a history
       substitution may be surrounded with ‘{’ and ‘}’ if necessary to insulate  it  from  the  characters  that
       follow.   Thus,  after  <b>ls</b>  <b>-ld</b>  <b>~paul</b>  we might do <b>!{l}a</b> to do <b>ls</b> <b>-ld</b> <b>~paula</b>, while <b>!la</b> would look for a
       command starting with “la”.

   <b>Quotations</b> <b>with</b> <b>'</b> <b>and</b> <b>"</b>
       The quotation of strings by  ‘'’  and  ‘"’  can  be  used  to  prevent  all  or  some  of  the  remaining
       substitutions.   Strings enclosed in ‘'’ are prevented from any further interpretation.  Strings enclosed
       in ‘"’ may be expanded as described below.

       In both cases the resulting text becomes (all or part of) a single word; only in one  special  case  (see
       <u>Command</u>  <u>Substitution</u>  below)  does  a  ‘"’  quoted  string yield parts of more than one word; ‘'’ quoted
       strings never do.

   <b>Alias</b> <b>substitution</b>
       The shell maintains a list of aliases that can be established, displayed and modified by  the  <b>alias</b>  and
       <b>unalias</b>  commands.   After  a  command line is scanned, it is parsed into distinct commands and the first
       word of each command, left-to-right, is checked to see if it has an alias.  If it  does,  then  the  text
       that  is the alias for that command is reread with the history mechanism available as though that command
       were the previous input line.  The resulting  words  replace  the  command  and  argument  list.   If  no
       reference is made to the history list, then the argument list is left unchanged.

       Thus  if  the  alias  for “ls” is “ls -l”, the command <b>ls</b> <b><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></b> would map to <b>ls</b> <b>-l</b> <b><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></b>, the argument list
       here being undisturbed.  Similarly, if the alias for “lookup” was “grep !^ <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>” then <b>lookup</b>  <b>bill</b>
       would map to <b>grep</b> <b>bill</b> <b><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></b>.

       If  an  alias  is  found, the word transformation of the input text is performed and the aliasing process
       begins again on the reformed input line.  Looping is prevented if the first word of the new text  is  the
       same as the old by flagging it to prevent further aliasing.  Other loops are detected and cause an error.

       Note  that the mechanism allows aliases to introduce parser metasyntax.  Thus, we can <b>alias</b> <b>print</b> <b>'pr</b> <b>\!*</b>
       <b>|</b> <b>lpr'</b> to make a command that <b>pr</b>'s its arguments to the line printer.

   <b>Variable</b> <b>substitution</b>
       The shell maintains a set of variables, each of which has as value a list of zero or more words.  Some of
       these variables are set by the shell or referred to by it.  For instance, the <u>argv</u> variable is  an  image
       of the shell's argument list, and words of this variable's value are referred to in special ways.

       The  values  of  variables  may  be  displayed  and  changed by using the <b>set</b> and <b>unset</b> commands.  Of the
       variables referred to by the shell a number are toggles; the shell does not care  what  their  value  is,
       only  whether  they  are  set or not.  For instance, the <u>verbose</u> variable is a toggle that causes command
       input to be echoed.  The setting of this variable results from the <b>-v</b> command-line option.

       Other operations treat variables numerically.  The <b>@</b> command permits numeric calculations to be performed
       and the result assigned to a variable.  Variable values are, however,  always  represented  as  (zero  or
       more) strings.  For the purposes of numeric operations, the null string is considered to be zero, and the
       second and additional words of multiword values are ignored.

       After the input line is aliased and parsed, and before each command is executed, variable substitution is
       performed,  keyed  by  ‘$’  characters.   This expansion can be prevented by preceding the ‘$’ with a ‘\’
       except within double quotes (‘"’), where it <u>always</u> occurs, and within single quotes (‘'’), where it <u>never</u>
       occurs.  Strings quoted by backticks (` `) are interpreted later (see “Command substitution”  below),  so
       ‘$’ substitution does not occur there until later, if at all.  A ‘$’ is passed unchanged if followed by a
       blank, tab, or end-of-line.

       Input/output redirections are recognized before variable expansion, and are variable expanded separately.
       Otherwise,  the command name and entire argument list are expanded together.  It is thus possible for the
       first (command) word (to this point) to generate more than one word,  the  first  of  which  becomes  the
       command name, and the rest of which become arguments.

       Unless enclosed in ‘"’ or given the ‘:q’ modifier, the results of variable substitution may eventually be
       command  and filename substituted.  Within ‘"’, a variable whose value consists of multiple words expands
       to (a portion of) a single word, with the words of the variable's value separated by  blanks.   When  the
       ‘:q’  modifier  is  applied  to a substitution, the variable will expand to multiple words with each word
       separated by a blank and quoted to prevent later command or filename substitution.

       The following metasequences are provided for introducing variable values into the shell input.  Except as
       noted, it is an error to reference a variable that is not set.

             $name
             ${name}
                     Are replaced by the words of the value of variable <u>name</u>, each separated by a blank.  Braces
                     insulate <u>name</u> from following  characters  that  would  otherwise  be  part  of  it.   Shell
                     variables have names consisting of up to 20 letters and digits starting with a letter.  The
                     underscore  character  is considered a letter.  If <u>name</u> is not a shell variable, but is set
                     in the environment, then that value is returned (but ‘:’  modifiers  and  the  other  forms
                     given below are not available here).
             $name[selector]
             ${name[selector]}
                     May  be  used  to  select  only  some of the words from the value of <u>name</u>.  The selector is
                     subjected to ‘$’ substitution and may consist of a single number or two  numbers  separated
                     by  a ‘-’.  The first word of a variable's value is numbered ‘1’.  If the first number of a
                     range is omitted, it defaults to ‘1’.  If the  last  number  of  a  range  is  omitted,  it
                     defaults  to ‘$#name’.  The selector ‘*’ selects all words.  It is not an error for a range
                     to be empty if the second argument is omitted or in range.
             $#name
             ${#name}
                     Gives the  number  of  words  in  the  variable.   This  is  useful  for  later  use  in  a
                     “$argv[selector]”.
             $0      Substitutes  the  name of the file from which command input is being read.  An error occurs
                     if the name is not known.
             $number
             ${number}
                     Equivalent to “$argv[number]”.
             $*      Equivalent to “$argv[*]”.

       The modifiers ‘:e’, ‘:h’, ‘:t’, ‘:r’, ‘:q’, and ‘:x’ may be applied to the  substitutions  above  as  may
       ‘:gh’,  ‘:gt’,  and  ‘:gr’.   If braces ‘{’ ‘}’ appear in the command form then the modifiers must appear
       within the braces.  The current implementation allows only one ‘:’ modifier on each ‘$’ expansion.

       The following substitutions may not be modified with ‘:’ modifiers.
             $?name
             ${?name}
                     Substitutes the string “1” if name is set, “0” if it is not.
             $?0     Substitutes ‘1’ if the current input filename is known, ‘0’ if it is not.
             $$      Substitute the (decimal) process number of the (parent) shell.  Do <u>NOT</u> use  this  mechanism
                     for generating temporary file names; see <u><a href="../man1/mktemp.1.html">mktemp</a></u>(1) instead.
             $!      Substitute  the  (decimal)  process  number  of the last background process started by this
                     shell.
             $&lt;      Substitutes a line from the standard input, with no further interpretation.  It can be used
                     to read from the keyboard in a shell script.

   <b>Command</b> <b>and</b> <b>filename</b> <b>substitution</b>
       The remaining substitutions, command and filename substitution, are applied selectively to the  arguments
       of  built-in  commands.  By selectively, we mean that portions of expressions which are not evaluated are
       not subjected to these expansions.  For commands that are not internal to the shell, the command name  is
       substituted  separately from the argument list.  This occurs very late, after input-output redirection is
       performed, and in a child of the main shell.

   <b>Command</b> <b>substitution</b>
       Command substitution is shown by a command enclosed in ‘`’.  The output from such a command  is  normally
       broken into separate words at blanks, tabs, and newlines, with null words being discarded; this text then
       replaces the original string.  Within double quotes (‘"’), only newlines force new words; blanks and tabs
       are preserved.

       In  any  case,  the  single final newline does not force a new word.  Note that it is thus possible for a
       command substitution to yield only part of a word, even if the command outputs a complete line.

   <b>Filename</b> <b>substitution</b>
       If a word contains any of the characters ‘*’, ‘?’, ‘[’, or ‘{’, or begins with the  character  ‘~’,  then
       that word is a candidate for filename substitution, also known as “globbing”.  This word is then regarded
       as a pattern, and replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of file names that match the pattern.  In a
       list  of  words  specifying filename substitution it is an error for no pattern to match an existing file
       name, but it is not required for each pattern to match.  Only the metacharacters ‘*’, ‘?’, and ‘[’  imply
       pattern matching, the characters ‘~’ and ‘{’ being more akin to abbreviations.

       In  matching  filenames, the character ‘.’ at the beginning of a filename or immediately following a ‘/’,
       as well as the character ‘/’ must be matched  explicitly.   The  character  ‘*’  matches  any  string  of
       characters, including the null string.  The character ‘?’ matches any single character.

       The  sequence  “[...]”  matches any one of the characters enclosed.  Within “[...]”, a pair of characters
       separated by ‘-’ matches any character lexically between the two (inclusive).  Within “[...]”,  the  name
       of  a  <u>character</u>  <u>class</u> enclosed in ‘[:’ and ‘:]’ stands for the list of all characters belonging to that
       class.  Supported character classes:

             alnum   cntrl   lower   space
             alpha   digit   print   upper
             blank   graph   punct   xdigit

       These match characters using the macros specified in <u><a href="../man3/isalnum.3.html">isalnum</a></u>(3), <u><a href="../man3/isalpha.3.html">isalpha</a></u>(3),  and  so  on.   A  character
       class may not be used as an endpoint of a range.

       The  character ‘~’ at the beginning of a filename refers to home directories.  Standing alone, i.e., ‘~’,
       it expands to the invoker's home directory as reflected in the value of the variable <u>home</u>.  When followed
       by a name consisting of letters, digits, and ‘-’ characters, the shell searches for a user with that name
       and substitutes their home directory; thus  “~ken”  might  expand  to  “/usr/ken”  and  “~ken/chmach”  to
       “/usr/ken/chmach”.   If  the character ‘~’ is followed by a character other than a letter or ‘/’, or does
       not appear at the beginning of a word, it is left undisturbed.

       The metanotation “a{b,c,d}e” is a shorthand for “abe ace ade”.  Left to right order  is  preserved,  with
       results  of matches being sorted separately at a low level to preserve this order.  This construct may be
       nested.  Thus, “~source/s1/{oldls,ls}.c” expands to “/usr/source/s1/oldls.c /usr/source/s1/ls.c”  without
       chance  of  error  if the home directory for “source” is “/usr/source”.  Similarly “../{memo,*box}” might
       expand to “../memo ../box ../mbox”.  (Note that “memo” was not sorted with the results of  the  match  to
       “*box”.)  As a special case ‘{’, ‘}’, and ‘{}’ are passed undisturbed.

   <b>Input/output</b>
       The standard input and the standard output of a command may be redirected with the following syntax:

             &lt; name  Open  file  <u>name</u>  (which is first variable, command, and filename expanded) as the standard
                     input.
             &lt;&lt; word
                     Read the shell input up to a line that is identical to <u>word</u>.   <u>word</u>  is  not  subjected  to
                     variable, command, or filename substitution, and each input line is compared to <u>word</u> before
                     any  substitutions  are  done  on  the  input  line.  Unless a quoting ‘\’, ‘"’, ‘'’ or ‘`’
                     appears in <u>word</u>, variable and command substitution is performed on the  intervening  lines,
                     allowing  ‘\’  to  quote  ‘$’, ‘\’ and ‘`’.  Commands that are substituted have all blanks,
                     tabs, and newlines preserved, except for the final newline which is dropped.  The resultant
                     text is placed in an anonymous temporary file that is given to the command as its  standard
                     input.
             &gt; name
             &gt;! name
             &gt;&amp; name
             &gt;&amp;! name
                     The  file  <u>name</u>  is  used  as  the  standard output.  If the file does not exist then it is
                     created; if the file exists, it is truncated; its previous contents are lost.

                     If the variable <u>noclobber</u> is set, then the file must not exist or be  a  character  special
                     file  (e.g.,  a  terminal or <u>/dev/null</u>) or an error results.  This helps prevent accidental
                     destruction of files.  Here, the ‘!’ forms can be used to suppress this check.

                     The forms involving ‘&amp;’ route the standard error output into the specified file as well  as
                     the standard output.  <u>name</u> is expanded in the same way as ‘&lt;’ input filenames are.
             &gt;&gt; name
             &gt;&gt;&amp; name
             &gt;&gt;! name
             &gt;&gt;&amp;! name
                     Uses  file  <u>name</u> as the standard output; like ‘&gt;’ but places output at the end of the file.
                     If the variable <u>noclobber</u> is set, then it is an error for the file not to exist unless  one
                     of the ‘!’ forms is given.  Otherwise similar to ‘&gt;’.

       A  command  receives  the  environment  in  which  the  shell was invoked as modified by the input-output
       parameters and the presence of the command in a pipeline.  Thus, unlike some  previous  shells,  commands
       run  from  a  file  of shell commands have no access to the text of the commands by default; instead they
       receive the original standard input of the shell.  The ‘&lt;&lt;’ mechanism should be used  to  present  inline
       data.   This permits shell command scripts to function as components of pipelines and allows the shell to
       block read its input.  Note that the default standard input for a command run detached is <u>not</u> modified to
       be the empty file <u>/dev/null</u>; instead the standard input remains as the original  standard  input  of  the
       shell.   If  this  is  a terminal and if the process attempts to read from the terminal, then the process
       will block and the user will be notified (see “Jobs” above).

       The standard error output may be directed through a pipe with the standard output.  Simply use  the  form
       ‘|&amp;’ instead of just ‘|’.

   <b>Expressions</b>
       Several  of  the  built-in  commands (to be described later) take expressions, in which the operators are
       similar to those of C, with the same precedence, but with the <u>opposite</u> <u>grouping</u>: right  to  left.   These
       expressions appear in the <b>@</b>, <b>exit</b>, <b>if</b>, and <b>while</b> commands.  The following operators are available:

             ||  &amp;&amp;  |  ^  &amp;  ==  !=  =~  !~  &lt;=  &gt;= &lt;  &gt; &lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt;  +  -  *  /  %  !  ~  (  )

       Here  the  precedence  increases  to  the right, ‘==’ ‘!=’ ‘=~’ and ‘!~’, ‘&lt;=’ ‘&gt;=’ ‘&lt;’ and ‘&gt;’, ‘&lt;&lt;’ and
       ‘&gt;&gt;’, ‘+’ and ‘-’, ‘*’ ‘/’ and ‘%’ being, in groups, at the same level.  The  ‘==’  ‘!=’  ‘=~’  and  ‘!~’
       operators compare their arguments as strings; all others operate on numbers.  The operators ‘=~’ and ‘!~’
       are  like  ‘!=’  and  ‘==’  except that the right hand side is a <u>pattern</u> (containing, e.g., *'s, ?'s, and
       instances of “[...]”) against which the left-hand operand is matched.  This reduces the need for  use  of
       the <u>switch</u> statement in shell scripts when all that is really needed is pattern matching.

       Strings  that begin with ‘0’ are considered octal numbers.  Null or missing arguments are considered ‘0’.
       The results of all expressions are strings, which represent decimal numbers.  It  is  important  to  note
       that  no  two components of an expression can appear in the same word; except when adjacent to components
       of expressions that are syntactically significant to the parser (‘&amp;’, ‘|’, ‘&lt;’, ‘&gt;’, ‘(’, and ‘)’),  they
       should be surrounded by spaces.

       Also  available  in  expressions as primitive operands are command executions enclosed in ‘{’ and ‘}’ and
       file enquiries of the form <b>-l</b> <u>name</u> where <b>l</b> is one of:

             r       read access
             w       write access
             x       execute access
             e       existence
             o       ownership
             z       zero size
             f       plain file
             d       directory
             p       named pipe (FIFO)
             l       symbolic link

       The specified name is command and filename expanded and then tested  to  see  if  it  has  the  specified
       relationship  to  the real user.  If the file does not exist or is inaccessible then all enquiries return
       false, i.e., ‘0’.  Command executions succeed, returning true, i.e.,  ‘1’,  if  the  command  exits  with
       status  0,  otherwise  they  fail,  returning  false,  i.e., ‘0’.  If more detailed status information is
       required then the command should be executed outside an expression and the variable <u>status</u> examined.

   <b>Control</b> <b>flow</b>
       The shell contains several commands that can be used to regulate the flow of  control  in  command  files
       (shell  scripts)  and  (in  limited  but useful ways) from terminal input.  These commands all operate by
       forcing the shell to reread or skip in its  input  and,  because  of  the  implementation,  restrict  the
       placement of some of the commands.

       The  <b>foreach</b>,  <b>switch</b>, and <b>while</b> statements, as well as the <b>if-then-else</b> form of the <b>if</b> statement require
       that the major keywords appear in a single simple command on an input line as shown below.

       If the shell's input is not seekable, the shell buffers up input  whenever  a  loop  is  being  read  and
       performs  seeks  in this internal buffer to accomplish the rereading implied by the loop.  (To the extent
       that this allows, backward goto's will succeed on non-seekable inputs.)

   <b>Built-in</b> <b>commands</b>
       Built-in commands are executed within the shell.  If a built-in command occurs  as  any  component  of  a
       pipeline except the last then it is executed in a sub-shell.

             <b>alias</b>
             <b>alias</b> <u>name</u>
             <b>alias</b> <u>name</u> <u>wordlist</u>
                     The  first  form prints all aliases.  The second form prints the alias for name.  The final
                     form assigns the specified <u>wordlist</u> as the alias of <u>name</u>; <u>wordlist</u> is command and  filename
                     substituted.  <u>name</u> is not allowed to be “alias” or “unalias”.

             <b>bg</b>
             <b>bg</b> <b>%</b><u>job</u> <u>...</u>
                     Puts  the  current  or  specified  jobs  into  the background, continuing them if they were
                     stopped.

             <b>break</b>   Causes execution to resume after the <b>end</b> of the nearest enclosing <b>foreach</b>  or  <b>while</b>.   The
                     remaining  commands on the current line are executed.  Multi-level breaks are thus possible
                     by writing them all on one line.

             <b>breaksw</b>
                     Causes a break from a <b>switch</b>, resuming after the <b>endsw</b>.

             <b>case</b> <u>label</u>:
                     A label in a <b>switch</b> statement as discussed below.

             <b>cd</b>
             <b>cd</b> <u>name</u>
             <b>chdir</b>
             <b>chdir</b> <u>name</u>
                     Change the shell's working directory to directory <u>name</u>.   If  no  argument  is  given  then
                     change  to  the  home directory of the user.  If <u>name</u> is not found as a subdirectory of the
                     current directory (and does not begin with ‘/’, ‘./’ or ‘../’), then each component of  the
                     variable  <u>cdpath</u>  is  checked  to  see if it has a subdirectory <u>name</u>.  Finally, if all else
                     fails but <u>name</u> is a shell variable whose value begins with ‘/’, then this is tried  to  see
                     if it is a directory.

             <b>continue</b>
                     Continue  execution of the nearest enclosing <b>while</b> or <b>foreach</b>.  The rest of the commands on
                     the current line are executed.

             <b>default</b>:
                     Labels the default case in a <b>switch</b> statement.  The default  should  come  after  all  <b>case</b>
                     labels.

             <b>dirs</b>    Prints the directory stack; the top of the stack is at the left, the first directory in the
                     stack being the current directory.

             <b>echo</b> <u>wordlist</u>
             <b>echo</b> <b>-n</b> <u>wordlist</u>
                     The  specified  words  are written to the shell's standard output, separated by spaces, and
                     terminated with a newline unless the <b>-n</b> option is specified.

             <b>else</b>
             <b>end</b>
             <b>endif</b>
             <b>endsw</b>   See the description of the <b>foreach</b>, <b>if</b>, <b>switch</b>, and <b>while</b> statements below.

             <b>eval</b> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>
                     (As in <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1).)  The arguments are read as input to the shell and the  resulting  command(s)
                     executed  in  the  context  of the current shell.  This is usually used to execute commands
                     generated as the result of command or variable substitution, since  parsing  occurs  before
                     these substitutions.  See <u><a href="../man1/tset.1.html">tset</a></u>(1) for an example of using <b>eval</b>.

             <b>exec</b> <u>command</u>
                     The specified command is executed in place of the current shell.

             <b>exit</b>
             <b>exit</b> (<u>expr</u>)
                     The shell exits either with the value of the <b>status</b> variable (first form) or with the value
                     of the specified <b>expr</b> (second form).

             <b>fg</b>
             <b>fg</b> <b>%</b><u>job</u> <u>...</u>
                     Brings  the  current  or  specified  jobs into the foreground, continuing them if they were
                     stopped.

             <b>foreach</b> <u>name</u> (<u>wordlist</u>)
             ...
             <b>end</b>     The variable <u>name</u> is successively set to each  member  of  <u>wordlist</u>  and  the  sequence  of
                     commands  between  this  command  and the matching <b>end</b> are executed.  (Both <b>foreach</b> and <b>end</b>
                     must appear alone on separate lines.)   The  built-in  command  <b>continue</b>  may  be  used  to
                     continue  the  loop prematurely and the built-in command <b>break</b> to terminate it prematurely.
                     When this command is read from the terminal, the loop  is  read  once  prompting  with  ‘?’
                     before  any statements in the loop are executed.  If you make a mistake typing in a loop at
                     the terminal, you can rub it out.

             <b>glob</b> <u>wordlist</u>
                     Like <b>echo</b> but no ‘\’ escapes are recognized and words are delimited by  NUL  characters  in
                     the  output.   Useful  for programs that wish to use the shell to filename expand a list of
                     words.

             <b>goto</b> <u>word</u>
                     The specified <u>word</u> is filename and command expanded to yield a string of the form  ‘label’.
                     The  shell  rewinds  its  input  as  much  as  possible and searches for a line of the form
                     “label:”, possibly preceded by blanks or tabs.  Execution  continues  after  the  specified
                     line.

             <b>hashstat</b>
                     Print  a statistics line showing how effective the internal hash table has been at locating
                     commands (and avoiding <b>exec</b>'s).  An <b>exec</b> is attempted for each component of the <u>path</u>  where
                     the  hash function indicates a possible hit, and in each component that does not begin with
                     a ‘/’.

             <b>history</b>
             <b>history</b> <u>n</u>
             <b>history</b> <b>-h</b> <u>n</u>
             <b>history</b> <b>-r</b> <u>n</u>
                     Displays the history event list; if <u>n</u> is given, only the <u>n</u> most recent events are  printed.
                     The  <b>-h</b>  option causes the history list to be printed without leading numbers.  This format
                     produces files suitable for sourcing using the <b>-h</b> option to <b>source</b>.  The <b>-r</b> option reverses
                     the order of printout to be most recent first instead of oldest first.

             <b>if</b> (<u>expr</u>) command
                     If the specified expression evaluates to true, then the single <u>command</u>  with  arguments  is
                     executed.  Variable substitution on <u>command</u> happens early, at the same time it does for the
                     rest  of the <b>if</b> command.  <u>command</u> must be a simple command, not a pipeline, a command list,
                     or a parenthesized command list.  Input/output redirection occurs even if  <u>expr</u>  is  false,
                     i.e., when command is <u>not</u> executed (this is a bug).

             <b>if</b> (<u>expr</u>) <b>then</b>
             ...
             <b>else</b> <b>if</b> (<u>expr2</u>) <b>then</b>
             ...
             <b>else</b>
             ...
             <b>endif</b>   If  the  specified  <u>expr</u>  is  true  then  the  commands  up to the first <b>else</b> are executed;
                     otherwise if <u>expr2</u> is true then the commands up to the second <b>else</b> are executed, etc.   Any
                     number  of <b>else-if</b> pairs are possible; only one <b>endif</b> is needed.  The <b>else</b> part is likewise
                     optional.  (The words <b>else</b> and <b>endif</b> must appear at the beginning of input  lines;  the  <b>if</b>
                     must appear alone on its input line or after an <b>else</b>.)

             <b>jobs</b>
             <b>jobs</b> <b>-l</b>
                     Lists  the  active  jobs;  the  <b>-l</b>  option  lists  process  IDs  in  addition to the normal
                     information.

             <b>kill</b> <b>%</b><u>job</u>
             <b>kill</b> [<b>-s</b> <u>signal_name</u>] <u>pid</u>
             <b>kill</b> <b>-sig</b> <u>pid</u> <u>...</u>
             <b>kill</b> <b>-l</b> [exit_status]
                     Sends either the SIGTERM (terminate) signal or the specified signal to the  specified  jobs
                     or  processes.   Signals  are  either  given by number or by names (as given in &lt;<u>signal.h</u>&gt;,
                     stripped of the prefix “SIG”).  The signal names are listed by “kill -l”; if an <u>exit_status</u>
                     is specified, only the corresponding signal name will be written.   There  is  no  default;
                     just  saying “kill” does not send a signal to the current job.  If the signal being sent is
                     SIGTERM (terminate) or SIGHUP (hangup), then the job or process  will  be  sent  a  SIGCONT
                     (continue) signal as well.

             <b>limit</b>
             <b>limit</b> <u>resource</u>
             <b>limit</b> <u>resource</u> <u>maximum-use</u>
             <b>limit</b> <b>-h</b>
             <b>limit</b> <b>-h</b> <u>resource</u>
             <b>limit</b> <b>-h</b> <u>resource</u> <u>maximum-use</u>
                     Limits  the  consumption  by  the  current  process  and  each  process  it  creates to not
                     individually exceed <u>maximum-use</u> on the specified <u>resource</u>.  If  no  <u>maximum-use</u>  is  given,
                     then the current limit is printed; if no <u>resource</u> is given, then all limitations are given.
                     If  the <b>-h</b> flag is given, the hard limits are used instead of the current limits.  The hard
                     limits impose a ceiling on the values of the current limits.  Only the superuser may  raise
                     the hard limits, but a user may lower or raise the current limits within the legal range.

                     Resources controllable currently include:

                     <u>cputime</u>       the maximum number of CPU-seconds to be used by each process.

                     <u>filesize</u>      the largest single file (in bytes) that can be created.

                     <u>datasize</u>      the maximum growth (in bytes) of the data segment.

                     <u>stacksize</u>     the maximum size of the automatically-extended stack region.

                     <u>coredumpsize</u>  the size of the largest core dump (in bytes) that will be created.

                     <u>memoryuse</u>     the  maximum size (in bytes) to which a process's resident set size (RSS) may
                                   grow.  Not enforced.

                     <u>memorylocked</u>  The maximum size (in bytes) which a process may lock into  memory  using  the
                                   <u><a href="../man2/mlock.2.html">mlock</a></u>(2) function.

                     <u>maxproc</u>       The maximum number of simultaneous processes for this user ID.

                     <u>openfiles</u>     The maximum number of simultaneous open files for this user ID.

                     <u>vmemoryuse</u>    the maximum size (in bytes) to which a process's total size may grow.

                     The  <u>maximum-use</u>  may  be given as a (floating point or integer) number followed by a scale
                     factor.  For all limits other than <u>cputime</u> the default scale is ‘k’  or  “kilobytes”  (1024
                     bytes);  a  scale  factor  of ‘m’ or “megabytes” may also be used.  For <u>cputime</u> the default
                     scale is “seconds”; a scale factor of ‘m’ for minutes or ‘h’ for hours, or a  time  of  the
                     form “mm:ss” giving minutes and seconds also may be used.

                     For both <u>resource</u> names and scale factors, unambiguous prefixes of the names suffice.

             <b>login</b>   Terminate  a login shell, replacing it with an instance of <u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?login">/usr/bin/login</a></u>.  This is one way
                     to log off, included for compatibility with <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1).

             <b>logout</b>  Terminate a login shell.  Especially useful if <u>ignoreeof</u> is set.

             <b>nice</b>
             <b>nice</b> <u>+number</u>
             <b>nice</b> <u>command</u>
             <b>nice</b> <u>+number</u> <u>command</u>
                     The first form sets the scheduling priority for this shell to 4.  The second form sets  the
                     priority  to  the  given  <u>number</u>.  The final two forms run command at priority 4 and <u>number</u>
                     respectively.  The greater the number, the less CPU the process will  get.   The  superuser
                     may specify negative priority by using “nice -number ...”.  <u>command</u> is always executed in a
                     sub-shell, and the restrictions placed on commands in simple <b>if</b> statements apply.

             <b>nohup</b>
             <b>nohup</b> <u>command</u>
                     The  first  form  can  be  used  in  shell  scripts  to cause hangups to be ignored for the
                     remainder of the script.  The second form causes the  specified  command  to  be  run  with
                     hangups ignored.  All processes detached with ‘&amp;’ are effectively <b>nohup</b>'ed.

             <b>notify</b>
             <b>notify</b> <b>%</b><u>job</u> <u>...</u>
                     Causes  the  shell  to  notify  the  user  asynchronously when the status of the current or
                     specified jobs change; normally  notification  is  presented  before  a  prompt.   This  is
                     automatic if the shell variable <u>notify</u> is set.

             <b>onintr</b>
             <b>onintr</b> <b>-</b>
             <b>onintr</b> <u>label</u>
                     Control  the action of the shell on interrupts.  The first form restores the default action
                     of the shell on interrupts, which is to  terminate  shell  scripts  or  to  return  to  the
                     terminal  command  input  level.   The  second  form  <b>onintr</b>  <b>-</b> causes all interrupts to be
                     ignored.  The final form causes the shell to execute a <b>goto</b>  <b>label</b>  when  an  interrupt  is
                     received or a child process terminates because it was interrupted.

                     In  any  case, if the shell is running detached and interrupts are being ignored, all forms
                     of <b>onintr</b> have no meaning and interrupts continue to  be  ignored  by  the  shell  and  all
                     invoked commands.  Finally, <b>onintr</b> statements are ignored in the system startup files where
                     interrupts are disabled (<u>/etc/csh.cshrc</u>, <u>/etc/csh.login</u>).

             <b>popd</b>
             <b>popd</b> <u>+n</u>
                     Pops  the  directory  stack,  returning  to  the  new top directory.  With an argument “+<u>n</u>”
                     discards the <u>n</u>'th entry in the stack.  The members of the directory stack are numbered from
                     the top starting at 0.

             <b>pushd</b>
             <b>pushd</b> <u>name</u>
             <b>pushd</b> <u>+n</u>
                     With no arguments, <b>pushd</b> exchanges the top two elements of the directory  stack.   Given  a
                     <u>name</u>  argument,  <b>pushd</b>  changes  to  the  new directory (ala <b>cd</b>) and pushes the old current
                     working directory (as in <b>cwd</b>) onto the directory stack.  With  a  numeric  argument,  <b>pushd</b>
                     rotates  the  <u>n</u>'th argument of the directory stack around to be the top element and changes
                     to it.  The members of the directory stack are numbered from the top starting at 0.

             <b>rehash</b>  Causes the internal hash table of the contents of the directories in the <u>path</u>  variable  to
                     be  recomputed.   This is needed if new commands are added to directories in the <b>path</b> while
                     you are logged in.  This should only be necessary if you add commands to one  of  your  own
                     directories, or if a systems programmer changes the contents of a system directory.

             <b>repeat</b> <u>count</u> <u>command</u>
                     The  specified <u>command</u>, which is subject to the same restrictions as the <u>command</u> in the one
                     line <b>if</b> statement above, is executed <u>count</u> times.  I/O  redirections  occur  exactly  once,
                     even if <u>count</u> is 0.

             <b>set</b>
             <b>set</b> <u>name</u>
             <b>set</b> <u>name</u>=word
             <b>set</b> <u>name[index]</u>=word
             <b>set</b> <u>name</u>=(wordlist)
                     The  first form of the command shows the value of all shell variables.  Variables that have
                     other than a single word as their value print as a parenthesized  word  list.   The  second
                     form  sets  <u>name</u>  to  the  null  string.  The third form sets <u>name</u> to the single <u>word</u>.  The
                     fourth form sets the <u>index</u>'th component of <u>name</u> to <u>word</u>; this component must already exist.
                     The final form sets <u>name</u> to the list of words in <u>wordlist</u>.  The value is always command and
                     filename expanded.

                     These arguments may be repeated to set multiple values  in  a  single  set  command.   Note
                     however, that variable expansion happens for all arguments before any setting occurs.

             <b>setenv</b>
             <b>setenv</b> <u>name</u>
             <b>setenv</b> <u>name</u> <u>value</u>
                     The  first  form lists all current environment variables.  It is equivalent to <u><a href="../man1/printenv.1.html">printenv</a></u>(1).
                     The last form sets the value of environment variable <u>name</u> to be  <u>value</u>,  a  single  string.
                     The second form sets <u>name</u> to an empty string.  The most commonly used environment variables
                     USER,  TERM,  and  PATH  are  automatically imported to and exported from the <b>csh</b> variables
                     <u>user</u>, <u>term</u>, and <u>path</u>; there is no need to use <b>setenv</b> for these.

             <b>shift</b>
             <b>shift</b> <u>variable</u>
                     The members of <b>argv</b> are shifted to the left, discarding <b>argv</b>[1].  It is an error  for  <b>argv</b>
                     not  to  be  set or to have less than one word as value.  The second form performs the same
                     function on the specified variable.

             <b>source</b> <u>name</u>
             <b>source</b> <b>-h</b> <u>name</u>
                     The shell reads commands from <u>name</u>.  <b>source</b> commands may be nested; if they are nested  too
                     deeply  the  shell  may  run  out  of  file descriptors.  An error in a <b>source</b> at any level
                     terminates all nested <b>source</b> commands.  Normally input during <b>source</b> commands is not placed
                     on the history list; the <b>-h</b> option causes the commands to be placed  on  the  history  list
                     without being executed.

             <b>stop</b>
             <b>stop</b> <b>%</b><u>job</u> <u>...</u>
                     Stops the current or specified jobs that are executing in the background.

             <b>suspend</b>
                     Causes  the shell to stop in its tracks, much as if it had been sent a stop signal with <b>^Z</b>.
                     This is most often used to stop shells started by <u><a href="../man1/su.1.html">su</a></u>(1).

             <b>switch</b> (<u>string</u>)
             <b>case</b> <u>str1</u>:
                 ...
                 <b>breaksw</b>
                 ...
             <b>default</b>:
                 ...
                 <b>breaksw</b>
             <b>endsw</b>   Each case label is successively matched  against  the  specified  <u>string</u>,  which  is  first
                     command and filename expanded.  The file metacharacters ‘*’, ‘?’ and “[...]” may be used in
                     the  case  labels,  which  are  variable  expanded.  If none of the labels match before the
                     “default” label is found, then the execution begins after the  default  label.   Each  case
                     label  and  the  default label must appear at the beginning of a line.  The command <b>breaksw</b>
                     causes execution to continue after the <b>endsw</b>.  Otherwise  control  may  fall  through  case
                     labels  and  the  default  label  as  in  C.   If no label matches and there is no default,
                     execution continues after the <b>endsw</b>.

             <b>time</b>
             <b>time</b> <u>command</u>
                     With no argument, a summary of time used by this shell and its  children  is  printed.   If
                     arguments  are given, the specified simple command is timed and a time summary as described
                     under the <b>time</b> variable is printed.  If necessary, an extra shell is created to  print  the
                     time statistic when the command completes.

             <b>umask</b>
             <b>umask</b> <u>value</u>
                     The  file  creation  mask  is  displayed (first form) or set to the specified value (second
                     form).  The mask is given in octal.  Common values for the mask are 002 giving  all  access
                     to  the  group  and read and execute access to others or 022 giving all access except write
                     access for users in the group or others.  The <u><a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</a></u>(2) manual page  provides  the  complete
                     list of bits that can be set.

             <b>unalias</b> <u>pattern</u>
                     All  aliases  whose  names match the specified pattern are discarded.  Thus all aliases are
                     removed by <b>unalias</b> <b>*</b>.  It is not an error for nothing to be <b>unalias</b>ed.

             <b>unhash</b>  Use of the internal hash table to speed location of executed programs is disabled.

             <b>unlimit</b>
             <b>unlimit</b> <u>resource</u>
             <b>unlimit</b> <b>-h</b>
             <b>unlimit</b> <b>-h</b> <u>resource</u>
                     Removes the limitation on <u>resource</u>.   If  no  <u>resource</u>  is  specified,  then  all  <u>resource</u>
                     limitations  are removed.  If <b>-h</b> is given, the corresponding hard limits are removed.  Only
                     the superuser may do this.

             <b>unset</b> <u>pattern</u>
                     All variables whose names match the specified pattern are removed.  Thus all variables  are
                     removed  by  <b>unset</b> <b>*</b>; this has noticeably distasteful side-effects.  It is not an error for
                     nothing to be <b>unset</b>.

             <b>unsetenv</b> <u>pattern</u>
                     Removes all variables whose names match the specified pattern from  the  environment.   See
                     also the <b>setenv</b> command above and <u><a href="../man1/printenv.1.html">printenv</a></u>(1).

             <b>wait</b>    Wait  for  all background jobs.  If the shell is interactive, then an interrupt can disrupt
                     the wait.  After the interrupt, the shell prints names and job numbers of all jobs known to
                     be outstanding.

             <b>which</b> <u>command</u>
                     Displays the resolved command that will be executed by the shell.

             <b>while</b> (<u>expr</u>)
             ...
             <b>end</b>     While the specified expression evaluates to non-zero, the commands between  the  <b>while</b>  and
                     the  matching  <b>end</b>  are evaluated.  <b>break</b> and <b>continue</b> may be used to terminate or continue
                     the loop prematurely.  (The <b>while</b>  and  <b>end</b>  must  appear  alone  on  their  input  lines.)
                     Prompting  occurs  here the first time through the loop as for the <b>foreach</b> statement if the
                     input is a terminal.

             <b>%</b><u>job</u>    Brings the specified job into the foreground.

             <b>%</b><u>job</u> <b>&amp;</b>  Continues the specified job in the background.

             <b>@</b>
             <b>@</b> <u>name</u>= expr
             <b>@</b> <u>name[index]</u>= expr
                     The first form prints the values of all the shell variables.   The  second  form  sets  the
                     specified  <u>name</u> to the value of <u>expr</u>.  If the expression contains ‘&lt;’, ‘&gt;’, ‘&amp;’ or ‘|’ then
                     at least this part of the expression must be placed within ‘(’ ‘)’.  The third form assigns
                     the value of <u>expr</u> to the <u>index</u>'th argument of <u>name</u>.  Both <u>name</u> and its  <u>index</u>'th  component
                     must already exist.

                     The  operators  ‘*=’, ‘+=’, etc. are available as in C.  The space separating the name from
                     the assignment  operator  is  optional.   Spaces  are,  however,  mandatory  in  separating
                     components of <u>expr</u>, which would otherwise be single words.

                     Special postfix ‘++’ and ‘--’ operators increment and decrement <u>name</u> respectively; i.e., “@
                     i++”.

   <b>Pre-defined</b> <b>and</b> <b>environment</b> <b>variables</b>
       The  following  variables  have  special  meaning to the shell.  Of these, <u>argv</u>, <u>cwd</u>, <u>home</u>, <u>path</u>, <u>prompt</u>,
       <u>shell</u> and <u>status</u> are always set by the shell.  Except for <u>cwd</u> and <u>status</u>, this  setting  occurs  only  at
       initialization; these variables will not then be modified unless done explicitly by the user.

       The  shell  copies  the  environment  variable USER into the variable <u>user</u>, TERM into <u>term</u>, and HOME into
       <u>home</u>, and copies these back into the environment whenever the normal  shell  variables  are  reset.   The
       environment  variable PATH is likewise handled; it is not necessary to worry about its setting other than
       in the file <u>.cshrc</u> as inferior <b>csh</b> processes will import the definition of <u>path</u> from the environment, and
       re-export it if you then change it.

       <b>argv</b>       Set to the arguments to the shell, it is from this variable  that  positional  parameters  are
                  substituted; i.e., “$1” is replaced by “$argv[1]”, etc.

       <b>cdpath</b>     Gives a list of alternate directories searched to find subdirectories in <b>chdir</b> commands.

       <b>cwd</b>        The full pathname of the current directory.

       <b>echo</b>       Set  when  the  <b>-x</b>  command-line option is given.  Causes each command and its arguments to be
                  echoed just before it is executed.  For non-built-in  commands  all  expansions  occur  before
                  echoing.   Built-in  commands are echoed before command and filename substitution, since these
                  substitutions are then done selectively.

       <b>filec</b>      Enable file name completion.

       <b>histchars</b>  Can be given a string value to change the characters used in history substitution.  The  first
                  character  of  its  value is used as the history substitution character, replacing the default
                  character ‘!’.  The second character  of  its  value  replaces  the  character  ‘^’  in  quick
                  substitutions.

       <b>histfile</b>   Can be set to the pathname where history is going to be saved/restored.

       <b>history</b>    Can  be  given  a numeric value to control the size of the history list.  Any command that has
                  been referenced in this many events will not be discarded.  Too large values  of  <u>history</u>  may
                  run the shell out of memory.  The last executed command is always saved on the history list.

       <b>home</b>       The  home  directory of the invoker, initialized from the environment.  The filename expansion
                  of “<u>~</u>” refers to this variable.

       <b>ignoreeof</b>  If set, the shell ignores end-of-file from input devices which are terminals.   This  prevents
                  shells from accidentally being killed by control-Ds.

       <b>mail</b>       The  files  where  the  shell  checks  for  mail.   This  checking  is done after each command
                  completion that will result in a prompt, if a specified interval has elapsed.  The shell  says
                  “You have new mail.” if the file exists with an access time not greater than its modify time.

                  If  the  first  word  of  the  value of <u>mail</u> is numeric it specifies a different mail checking
                  interval, in seconds, than the default, which is 10 minutes.

                  If multiple mail files are specified, then the shell says “New mail in  <u>name</u>”  when  there  is
                  mail in the file <u>name</u>.

       <b>noclobber</b>  As  described  in the section on “Input/output”, restrictions are placed on output redirection
                  to ensure that files are not accidentally destroyed,  and  that  ‘&gt;&gt;’  redirections  refer  to
                  existing files.

       <b>noglob</b>     If set, filename expansion is inhibited.  This inhibition is most useful in shell scripts that
                  are  not  dealing  with  filenames, or after a list of filenames has been obtained and further
                  expansions are not desirable.

       <b>nonomatch</b>  If set, it is not an error for a filename expansion to not match any existing  files;  instead
                  the  primitive  pattern  is  returned.   It  is still an error for the primitive pattern to be
                  malformed; i.e., “echo [” still gives an error.

       <b>notify</b>     If set, the shell notifies asynchronously of job completions; the default is  to  present  job
                  completions just before printing a prompt.

       <b>path</b>       Each  word  of  the <u>path</u> variable specifies a directory in which commands are to be sought for
                  execution.  A null word specifies the current directory.  If there is no  <u>path</u>  variable  then
                  only  full path names will execute.  The usual search path is “.”, “<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>”, “<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>”, “<a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a>”
                  and “<a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a>”, but this may vary from system to  system.   For  the  superuser  the  default
                  search  path  is  “<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>”, “<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>”, “<a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a>”, and “<a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a>”.  A shell that is given neither
                  the <b>-c</b> nor the <b>-t</b> option will normally hash the  contents  of  the  directories  in  the  <u>path</u>
                  variable  after reading <u>.cshrc</u>, and each time the <u>path</u> variable is reset.  If new commands are
                  added to these directories while the shell is active, it may be necessary to do  a  <b>rehash</b>  or
                  the commands may not be found.

       <b>prompt</b>     The string that is printed before each command is read from an interactive terminal input.  If
                  a  ‘!’  appears  in  the  string,  it  will  be  replaced by the current event number unless a
                  preceding ‘\’ is given.  Default is the first part of the hostname, followed by  “%”,  or  “#”
                  for the superuser.

       <b>savehist</b>   Is  given  a numeric value to control the number of entries of the history list that are saved
                  in <u><a href="file:~/.history">~/.history</a></u> when the user logs out.  Any command that  has  been  referenced  in  this  many
                  events  will  be  saved.   During  start up the shell sources <u><a href="file:~/.history">~/.history</a></u> into the history list
                  enabling history to be saved across logins.  Too large values of <u>savehist</u> will slow  down  the
                  shell during start up.  If <u>savehist</u> is just set, the shell will use the value of <u>history</u>.

       <b>shell</b>      The  file  in  which  the shell resides.  This variable is used in forking shells to interpret
                  files that have execute bits set, but which are  not  executable  by  the  system.   (See  the
                  description of “Non-built-in command execution” below.)  Initialized to the (system-dependent)
                  home of the shell.

       <b>status</b>     The  status  returned by the last command.  If it terminated abnormally, then 0200 is added to
                  the status.  Built-in commands that fail return exit status 1, all other built-in commands set
                  status to 0.

       <b>time</b>       Controls automatic timing of commands.  If set, then any command that  takes  more  than  this
                  many  CPU  seconds  will  cause  a line giving user, system, and real times, and a utilization
                  percentage which is the ratio of user plus system times to real time to  be  printed  when  it
                  terminates.

       <b>verbose</b>    Set  by  the  <b>-v</b>  command-line  option,  causes  the words of each command to be printed after
                  history substitution.

   <b>Non-built-in</b> <b>command</b> <b>execution</b>
       When a command to be executed is found to not be a built-in command, the shell attempts  to  execute  the
       command  via  <u><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></u>(2).   Each  word  in  the  variable <u>path</u> names a directory from which the shell will
       attempt to execute the command.  If it is given neither a <b>-c</b> nor a <b>-t</b> option, the  shell  will  hash  the
       names  in  these  directories  into  an internal table so that it will only try an <b>exec</b> in a directory if
       there is a possibility that the command resides there.  This shortcut  greatly  speeds  command  location
       when  many  directories  are  present  in  the  search  path.  If this mechanism has been turned off (via
       <b>unhash</b>), or if the shell was given a <b>-c</b> or <b>-t</b> argument, and in any case for each directory  component  of
       <u>path</u>  that  does  not begin with a ‘/’, the shell concatenates with the given command name to form a path
       name of a file which it then attempts to execute.

       Parenthesized commands are always executed in a sub-shell.  Thus

             <b>(cd</b>; <b>pwd)</b>; <b>pwd</b>

       prints the <u>home</u> directory; leaving you where you were (printing this after the home directory), while

             <b>cd</b>; <b>pwd</b>

       leaves you in the <u>home</u> directory.  Parenthesized commands are most  often  used  to  prevent  <b>chdir</b>  from
       affecting the current shell.

       If  the file has execute permissions but is not an executable binary to the system, then it is assumed to
       be a file containing shell commands and a new shell is spawned to read it.

       If there is an alias for <b>shell</b> then the words of the alias will be prepended to the argument list to form
       the shell command.  The first word of the alias should  be  the  full  path  name  of  the  shell  (e.g.,
       “$shell”).   Note  that  this  is  a special, late occurring, case of <b>alias</b> substitution, and only allows
       words to be prepended to the argument list without change.

   <b>Signal</b> <b>handling</b>
       The shell normally ignores SIGQUIT signals.  Jobs running detached (either by <b>&amp;</b>  or  the  <b>bg</b>  or  <b>%...</b>  <b>&amp;</b>
       commands)  are  immune to signals generated from the keyboard, including hangups.  Other signals have the
       values which the shell inherited from its parent.  The  shell's  handling  of  interrupts  and  terminate
       signals in shell scripts can be controlled by <b>onintr</b>.  Login shells catch the SIGTERM (terminate) signal;
       otherwise  this signal is passed on to children from the state in the shell's parent.  Interrupts are not
       allowed when a login shell is reading the file <u>.logout</u>.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Word lengths: Words can be no longer than 1024 characters.  The number of arguments  to  a  command  that
       involves  filename  expansion  is  limited to 1/6th the number of characters allowed in an argument list.
       Command substitutions may substitute no more characters than are allowed in an argument list.  To  detect
       looping, the shell restricts the number of <b>alias</b> substitutions on a single line to 20.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.cshrc">~/.cshrc</a></u>     read at beginning of execution by each shell
       <u><a href="file:~/.login">~/.login</a></u>     read by login shell, after <u>.cshrc</u> at login
       <u><a href="file:~/.logout">~/.logout</a></u>    read by login shell, at logout
       <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u>      standard shell, for shell scripts not starting with a ‘#’
       <u>/tmp/sh.*</u>    temporary file for ‘&lt;&lt;’

       W. Joy, <u>An</u> <u>Introduction</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>C</u> <u>shell</u>.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>csh</b>  first  appeared  in  2BSD.   It  was  a  first  implementation  of  a  command  language interpreter
       incorporating a history mechanism (see “History substitutions”), job  control  facilities  (see  “Jobs”),
       interactive  file name and user name completion (see “File name completion”), and a C-like syntax.  There
       are now many shells that also have these mechanisms, plus a few more (and maybe some bugs too), which are
       available through the usenet.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       Bill Joy, 1978.  Job control and directory stack features  first  implemented  by  J.E.  Kulp  of  IIASA,
       Laxenburg,  Austria,  with different syntax than that used now.  File name completion code written by Ken
       Greer, HP Labs.  Eight-bit implementation by Christos S. Zoulas, Cornell University.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       When a command is restarted from a stop, the shell  prints  the  directory  it  started  in  if  this  is
       different  from  the  current directory; this can be misleading (i.e., wrong) as the job may have changed
       directories internally.

       Shell built-in functions are not stoppable/restartable.  Command sequences of the form “a ; b  ;  c”  are
       also  not  handled gracefully when stopping is attempted.  If you suspend ‘b’, the shell will immediately
       execute ‘c’.  This is especially noticeable if this expansion results from  an  alias.   It  suffices  to
       place the sequence of commands in ()'s to force it to a sub-shell; i.e., “(a ; b ; c)”.

       Control  over  tty  output after processes are started is primitive; perhaps this will inspire someone to
       work on a good virtual terminal interface.  In a virtual terminal interface much more interesting  things
       could be done with output control.

       Alias  substitution  is most often used to clumsily simulate shell procedures; shell procedures should be
       provided instead of aliases.

       Commands within loops, prompted for by ‘?’, are not placed on the <b>history</b> list.  Control structure should
       be parsed instead of being recognized as built-in commands.  This would  allow  control  commands  to  be
       placed anywhere, to be combined with ‘|’, and to be used with ‘&amp;’ and ‘;’ metasyntax.

       It should be possible to use the ‘:’ modifiers on the output of command substitutions.

       The way the <u>filec</u> facility is implemented is ugly and expensive.
