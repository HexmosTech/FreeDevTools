       tcsh — C shell with file name completion and command line editing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcsh</b> [<b>-bcdefFimnqstvVxX</b>] [<b>-D</b><u>name</u>[=<u>value</u>]] [<u>arg</u>] ...
       <b>tcsh</b> <b>-l</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcsh</b>  is  an  enhanced  but  completely compatible version of the Berkeley UNIX C shell, <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1).  It is a
       command language interpreter usable both as an  interactive  login  shell  and  a  shell  script  command
       processor.   It  includes  a  command-line  editor (see “The command-line editor (+)”), programmable word
       completion (see “Completion and listing (+)”), spelling correction (see  “Spelling  correction  (+)”),  a
       history  mechanism  (see “History substitution”), job control (see “Jobs”) and a C-like syntax.  The “NEW
       FEATURES (+)” section describes major enhancements of <b>tcsh</b> over <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1).  Throughout this manual, features
       of <b>tcsh</b> not found in most <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) implementations (specifically,  the  4.4BSD  <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1))  are  labeled  with
       ‘(+)’, and features which are present in <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) but not usually documented are labeled with ‘(u)’.

   <b>Argument</b> <b>list</b> <b>processing</b>
       If  the  first  argument (argument 0) to the shell is ‘-’ then it is a login shell.  A login shell can be
       also specified by invoking the shell with the <b>-l</b> flag as the only argument.

       The rest of the flag arguments are interpreted as follows:

       <b>-b</b>      Forces a “break” from option processing, causing any further shell arguments  to  be  treated  as
               non-option  arguments.   The  remaining arguments will not be interpreted as shell options.  This
               may be used to pass options to a shell script without  confusion  or  possible  subterfuge.   The
               shell will not run a set-user ID script without this option.

       <b>-c</b>      Commands  are  read  from  the  following  argument  (which must be present, and must be a single
               argument), stored in the <b>command</b> shell variable  for  reference,  and  executed.   Any  remaining
               arguments are placed in the <b>argv</b> shell variable.

       <b>-d</b>      The  shell  loads  the directory stack from <u><a href="file:~/.cshdirs">~/.cshdirs</a></u> as described under “Startup and shutdown”,
               whether or not it is a login shell. (+)

       <b>-D</b><u>name</u>[=<u>value</u>]
               Sets the environment variable <u>name</u> to <u>value</u>.  (Domain/OS only) (+)

       <b>-e</b>      The shell exits if any invoked command terminates abnormally or yields a non-zero exit status.

       <b>-f</b>      The shell does not load any resource or startup files, or perform any command hashing,  and  thus
               starts faster.

       <b>-F</b>      The shell uses <u><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></u>(2) instead of <u><a href="../man2/vfork.2.html">vfork</a></u>(2) to spawn processes. (+)

       <b>-i</b>      The  shell  is  interactive  and  prompts for its top-level input, even if it appears to not be a
               terminal.  Shells are interactive without this option if their inputs and outputs are terminals.

       <b>-l</b>      The shell is a login shell.  Applicable only if <b>-l</b> is the only flag specified.

       <b>-m</b>      The shell loads <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u> even if it does not belong to the effective user.   Newer  versions  of
               <u><a href="../man1/su.1.html">su</a></u>(1) can pass <b>-m</b> to the shell. (+)

       <b>-n</b>      The shell parses commands but does not execute them.  This aids in debugging shell scripts.

       <b>-q</b>      The  shell  accepts SIGQUIT (see “Signal handling”) and behaves when it is used under a debugger.
               Job control is disabled. (u)

       <b>-s</b>      Command input is taken from the standard input.

       <b>-t</b>      The shell reads and executes a single line of input.  A ‘\’ may be used to escape the newline  at
               the end of this line and continue onto another line.

       <b>-v</b>      Sets the <b>verbose</b> shell variable, so that command input is echoed after history substitution.

       <b>-x</b>      Sets the <b>echo</b> shell variable, so that commands are echoed immediately before execution.

       <b>-V</b>      Sets the <b>verbose</b> shell variable even before executing <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u>.

       <b>-X</b>      Is to <b>-x</b> as <b>-V</b> is to <b>-v</b>.

       <b>--help</b>  Print a help message on the standard output and exit. (+)

       <b>--version</b>
               Print the version/platform/compilation options on the standard output and exit.  This information
               is also contained in the <b>version</b> shell variable. (+)

       After  processing  of  flag arguments, if arguments remain but none of the <b>-c</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>-s</b>, or <b>-t</b> options were
       given, the first argument is taken as the name of a file of commands, or “script”, to be  executed.   The
       shell  opens  this file and saves its name for possible resubstitution by ‘$0’.  Because many systems use
       either the standard version 6 or version 7 shells whose shell scripts are not compatible with this shell,
       the shell uses such a “standard” shell to execute a script whose first character is not a ‘#’, i.e., that
       does not start with a comment.

       Remaining arguments are placed in the <b>argv</b> shell variable.

   <b>Startup</b> <b>and</b> <b>shutdown</b>
       A login shell begins by executing commands from the system files <u>/etc/csh.cshrc</u> and  <u>/etc/csh.login</u>.   It
       then  executes  commands from files in the user's <u>home</u> directory: first <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u> <u>(+)</u> or, if <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u> is
       not found, <u><a href="file:~/.cshrc">~/.cshrc</a></u>, then the contents of <u><a href="file:~/.history">~/.history</a></u> (or the value of the <b>histfile</b>  shell  variable)  are
       loaded  into  memory, then <u><a href="file:~/.login">~/.login</a></u>, and finally <u><a href="file:~/.cshdirs">~/.cshdirs</a></u> (or the value of the <b>dirsfile</b> shell variable)
       (+).  The shell may read <u>/etc/csh.login</u> before instead  of  after  <u>/etc/csh.cshrc</u>,  and  <u><a href="file:~/.login">~/.login</a></u>  before
       instead  of  after  <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u> or <u><a href="file:~/.cshrc">~/.cshrc</a></u> and <u><a href="file:~/.history">~/.history</a></u>, if so compiled; see the <b>version</b> shell variable.
       (+)

       Non-login shells read only <u>/etc/csh.cshrc</u> and <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u> or <u><a href="file:~/.cshrc">~/.cshrc</a></u> on startup.

       For examples of startup files, please consult: <a href="http://tcshrc.sourceforge.net">http://tcshrc.sourceforge.net</a>

       Commands like <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/tset.1.html">tset</a></u>(1), which need be run only once per login, usually go  in  one's  <u><a href="file:~/.login">~/.login</a></u>
       file.   Users  who  need  to use the same set of files with both <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) and <b>tcsh</b> can have only a <u><a href="file:~/.cshrc">~/.cshrc</a></u>
       which checks for the existence of the <b>tcsh</b> shell variable before using  <b>tcsh</b>-specific  commands,  or  can
       have  both a <u><a href="file:~/.cshrc">~/.cshrc</a></u> and a <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u> which <b>source</b>s (see the builtin command) <u><a href="file:~/.cshrc">~/.cshrc</a></u>.  The rest of this
       manual uses <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u> to mean <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u> or, if <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u> is not found, <u><a href="file:~/.cshrc">~/.cshrc</a></u>.

       In the normal case, the shell begins reading commands from the terminal, prompting with
             <b>&gt;</b>

       (Processing of arguments and the use of the  shell  to  process  files  containing  command  scripts  are
       described later.)  The shell repeatedly reads a line of command input, breaks it into words, places it on
       the command history list, parses it and executes each command in the line.

       One  can  log  out by typing <b>^D</b> on an empty line, <b>logout</b> or <b>login</b> or via the shell's autologout mechanism
       (see the <b>autologout</b> shell variable).  When a login shell terminates it sets the <b>logout</b> shell variable  to
       ‘normal’  or  ‘automatic’  as  appropriate,  then  executes  commands  from the files <u>/etc/csh.logout</u> and
       <u><a href="file:~/.logout">~/.logout</a></u>.  The shell may drop DTR on logout if so compiled; see the <b>version</b> shell variable.

       The names of the system login and logout  files  vary  from  system  to  system  for  compatibility  with
       different <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) variants; see “FILES”.

   <b>Editing</b>
       We  first  describe  “The  command-line  editor  (+)”.   The  “Completion  and listing (+)” and “Spelling
       correction (+)” sections describe two sets of functionality that are implemented as editor  commands  but
       which  deserve  their  own  treatment.   Finally,  “Editor  commands  (+)” lists and describes the editor
       commands specific to the shell and their default bindings.

   <b>The</b> <b>command-line</b> <b>editor</b> <b>(+)</b>
       Command-line input can be edited using key sequences much like those used  in  <u><a href="../man1/emacs.1.html">emacs</a></u>(1)  or  <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1).   The
       editor  is active only when the <b>edit</b> shell variable is set, which it is by default in interactive shells.
       The <b>bindkey</b> builtin can display and change key bindings to editor commands (see “Editor  commands  (+)”).
       <u><a href="../man1/emacs.1.html">emacs</a></u>(1)-style key bindings are used by default (unless the shell was compiled otherwise; see the <b>version</b>
       shell variable), but <b>bindkey</b> can change the key bindings to <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1)-style bindings en masse.

       The  shell  always  binds  the  arrow  keys  (as  defined  in the TERMCAP environment variable) to editor
       commands:

             <b>Key</b>    <b>Editor</b> <b>command</b>

             <b>down</b>   <b>down-history</b>
             <b>up</b>     <b>up-history</b>
             <b>left</b>   <b>backward-char</b>
             <b>right</b>  <b>forward-char</b>

       unless doing so would alter another single-character binding.  One can set the arrow key escape sequences
       to the empty string with <b>settc</b> to prevent these bindings.  The ANSI/VT100 sequences for  arrow  keys  are
       always bound.

       Other  key  bindings are, for the most part, what <u><a href="../man1/emacs.1.html">emacs</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1) users would expect and can easily be
       displayed by <b>bindkey</b>, so there is no need to list them here.   Likewise,  <b>bindkey</b>  can  list  the  editor
       commands  with  a  short  description of each.  Certain key bindings have different behavior depending if
       <u><a href="../man1/emacs.1.html">emacs</a></u>(1) or <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1)-style bindings are being used; see <b>vimode</b> for more information.

       Note that editor commands do not have the same notion of a “word” as does the shell.  The editor delimits
       words with any non-alphanumeric  characters  not  in  the  shell  variable  <b>wordchars</b>,  while  the  shell
       recognizes  only whitespace and some of the characters with special meanings to it, listed under “Lexical
       structure”.

   <b>Completion</b> <b>and</b> <b>listing</b> <b>(+)</b>
       The shell is often able to complete words when given a unique abbreviation.  For example, typing part  of
       a word
             <b>ls</b> <b>/usr/lost</b>
       and  hit the tab key to run the <b>complete-word</b> editor command.  The shell completes the filename <u>/usr/lost</u>
       to <u>/usr/lost+found/</u>, replacing the incomplete word with the complete word in the input buffer.  (Note the
       terminal ‘<u>/</u>’; completion adds a ‘/’ to the end of completed directories and a space to the end  of  other
       completed  words, to speed typing and provide a visual indicator of successful completion.  The <b>addsuffix</b>
       shell variable can be unset to prevent this.)  If no match  is  found  (perhaps  <u>/usr/lost+found</u>  doesn't
       exist),  the  terminal bell rings.  If the word is already complete (perhaps there is a <u>/usr/lost</u> on your
       system, or perhaps you were thinking too far ahead and typed the whole thing) a ‘/’ or space is added  to
       the end if it isn't already there.

       Completion works anywhere in the line, not at just the end; completed text pushes the rest of the line to
       the  right.   Completion in the middle of a word often results in leftover characters to the right of the
       cursor that need to be deleted.

       Commands and variables can be completed in much the same way.  For example, typing
             <b>em[tab]</b>
       would complete ‘em’ to ‘emacs’ if ‘emacs’ were the only command  on  your  system  beginning  with  ‘em’.
       Completion can find a command in any directory in <b>path</b> or if given a full pathname.

       Typing
             <b>echo</b> <b>$ar[tab]</b>
       would complete ‘$ar’ to ‘$argv’ if no other variable began with ‘ar’.

       The  shell parses the input buffer to determine whether the word you want to complete should be completed
       as a filename, command or variable.  The first word in the buffer and the first word following ‘;’,  ‘|’,
       ‘|&amp;’,  ‘&amp;&amp;’,  or  ‘||’  is  considered  to be a command.  A word beginning with ‘$’ is considered to be a
       variable.  Anything else is a filename.  An empty line is “completed” as a filename.

       You  can  list  the  possible  completions  of  a  word  at  any  time  by   typing   <b>^D</b>   to   run   the
       <b>delete-char-or-list-or-eof</b>  editor  command.   The  shell  lists  the possible completions using the <b>ls-F</b>
       builtin and reprints the prompt and unfinished command line, for example:

             &gt; ls /usr/l[^D]
             lbin/       lib/        local/      lost+found/
             &gt; ls /usr/l

       If the <b>autolist</b> shell variable is set, the shell lists the remaining choices (if any) whenever completion
       fails:

             &gt; set autolist
             &gt; nm /usr/lib/libt[tab]
             libtermcap.a@ libtermlib.a@
             &gt; nm /usr/lib/libterm

       If the <b>autolist</b> shell variable is set to ‘ambiguous’, choices are listed only when completion  fails  and
       adds no new characters to the word being completed.

       A  filename  to be completed can contain variables, your own or others' home directories abbreviated with
       ‘~’ (see “Filename substitution”) and directory stack entries abbreviated with ‘=’ (see “Directory  stack
       substitution (+)”).  For example,

             &gt; ls ~k[^D]
             kahn    kas     kellogg
             &gt; ls ~ke[tab]
             &gt; ls ~kellogg/

       or

             &gt; set local = <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>
             &gt; ls $lo[tab]
             &gt; ls $local/[^D]
             bin/ etc/ lib/ man/ src/
             &gt; ls $local/

       Note that variables can also be expanded explicitly with the <b>expand-variables</b> editor command.

       <b>delete-char-or-list-or-eof</b>  lists  at  only  the  end of the line; in the middle of a line it deletes the
       character under the cursor and on an empty line it logs one out or, if the  <b>ignoreeof</b>  variable  is  set,
       does nothing.  <b>M-^D</b>, bound to the editor command <b>list-choices</b>, lists completion possibilities anywhere on
       a  line, and <b>list-choices</b> (or any one of the related editor commands that do or don't delete, list and/or
       log out, listed under <b>delete-char-or-list-or-eof</b>) can be bound to <b>^D</b> with the <b>bindkey</b> builtin command  if
       so desired.

       The  <b>complete-word-fwd</b>  and  <b>complete-word-back</b> editor commands (not bound to any keys by default) can be
       used to cycle up and down through the list of possible completions, replacing the current word  with  the
       next or previous word in the list.

       The  shell  variable  <b>fignore</b> can be set to a list of suffixes to be ignored by completion.  Consider the
       following:

             &gt; ls
             Makefile        condiments.h~   main.o          side.c
             README          main.c          meal            side.o
             condiments.h    main.c~
             &gt; set fignore = (.o \~)
             &gt; emacs ma[^D]
             main.c   main.c~  main.o
             &gt; emacs ma[tab]
             &gt; emacs main.c

       ‘main.c~’ and ‘main.o’ are ignored by completion (but not listing),  because  they  end  in  suffixes  in
       <b>fignore</b>.   Note  that  a  ‘\’  was  needed  in  front of ‘~’ to prevent it from being expanded to <b>home</b> as
       described under “Filename substitution”.  <b>fignore</b> is ignored if only one completion is possible.

       If the <b>complete</b> shell variable is set to ‘enhance’, completion 1) ignores case and 2) considers  periods,
       hyphens  and  underscores  (‘.’,  ‘-’,  and  ‘_’) to be word separators and hyphens and underscores to be
       equivalent.  If you had the following files

             comp.lang.c      comp.lang.perl   comp.std.c++
             comp.lang.c++    comp.std.c

       and typed
             <b>mail</b> <b>-f</b> <b>c.l.c[tab]</b>
       it would be completed to
             <b>mail</b> <b>-f</b> <b>comp.lang.c</b>
       and typing
             <b>mail</b> <b>-f</b> <b>c.l.c[^D]</b>
       would list ‘comp.lang.c’ and ‘comp.lang.c++’.

       Typing
             <b>mail</b> <b>-f</b> <b>c..c++[^D]</b>
       would list ‘comp.lang.c++’ and ‘comp.std.c++’.

       Typing
             <b>rm</b> <b>a--file[^D]</b>
       in the following directory

             A_silly_file    a-hyphenated-file    another_silly_file

       would list all three files, because case is ignored and hyphens and underscores are equivalent.  Periods,
       however, are not equivalent to hyphens or underscores.

       If the <b>complete</b> shell variable is set to ‘Enhance’, completion ignores case  and  differences  between  a
       hyphen  and  an  underscore  word  separator  only when the user types a lowercase character or a hyphen.
       Entering an uppercase character or an underscore will not match the corresponding lowercase character  or
       hyphen word separator.

       Typing
             <b>rm</b> <b>a--file[^D]</b>
       in the directory of the previous example would still list all three files, but typing
             <b>rm</b> <b>A--file</b>
       would match only ‘A_silly_file’ and typing
             <b>rm</b> <b>a__file[^D]</b>
       would match just ‘A_silly_file’ and ‘another_silly_file’ because the user explicitly used an uppercase or
       an underscore character.

       Completion  and listing are affected by several other shell variables: <b>recexact</b> can be set to complete on
       the shortest possible unique match, even if more typing might result in a longer match:

             &gt; ls
             fodder   foo      food     foonly
             &gt; set recexact
             &gt; rm fo[tab]

       just beeps, because ‘fo’ could expand to ‘fod’ or ‘foo’, but if we type another ‘o’,

             &gt; rm foo[tab]
             &gt; rm foo

       the completion completes on ‘foo’, even though ‘food’ and ‘foonly’ also match.  <b>autoexpand</b> can be set  to
       run the <b>expand-history</b> editor command before each completion attempt, <b>autocorrect</b> can be set to spelling-
       correct  the  word  to  be  completed  (see “Spelling correction (+)”) before each completion attempt and
       <b>correct</b> can be set to complete commands automatically after one hits return.  <b>matchbeep</b>  can  be  set  to
       make  completion beep or not beep in a variety of situations, and <b>nobeep</b> can be set to never beep at all.
       <b>nostat</b> can be set to a list of  directories  and/or  patterns  that  match  directories  to  prevent  the
       completion  mechanism from <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2)ing those directories.  <b>listmax</b> and <b>listmaxrows</b> can be set to limit the
       number of items and rows (respectively) that are listed without asking first.  <b>recognize_only_executables</b>
       can be set to make the shell list only executables when listing commands, but it is quite slow.

       Finally, the <b>complete</b> builtin command can be used to tell the shell how  to  complete  words  other  than
       filenames,  commands  and  variables.  Completion and listing do not work on glob-patterns (see “Filename
       substitution”), but the <b>list-glob</b> and <b>expand-glob</b> editor commands perform equivalent functions for  glob-
       patterns.

   <b>Spelling</b> <b>correction</b> <b>(+)</b>
       The  shell  can  sometimes  correct  the  spelling  of  filenames, commands and variable names as well as
       completing and listing them.

       Individual words can be spelling-corrected with the <b>spell-word</b> editor command (usually bound to  <b>M-s</b>  and
       <b>M-S</b>)  and the entire input buffer with <b>spell-line</b> (usually bound to <b>M-$</b>).  The <b>correct</b> shell variable can
       be set to ‘cmd’ to correct the command name or ‘all’ to correct the  entire  line  each  time  return  is
       typed, and <b>autocorrect</b> can be set to correct the word to be completed before each completion attempt.

       When  spelling  correction  is  invoked  in  any  of these ways and the shell thinks that any part of the
       command line is misspelled, it prompts with the corrected line:

             &gt; set correct = cmd
             &gt; lz <a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>
             CORRECT&gt;ls <a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a> (y|n|e|a)?

       One can answer ‘y’ or space to execute the corrected line, ‘e’ to leave the uncorrected  command  in  the
       input  buffer,  ‘a’ to abort the command as if <b>^C</b> had been hit, and anything else to execute the original
       line unchanged.

       Spelling correction recognizes user-defined completions (see the <b>complete</b> builtin command).  If an  input
       word  in  a  position for which a completion is defined resembles a word in the completion list, spelling
       correction registers a misspelling and suggests the latter word as a correction.  However, if  the  input
       word  does  not  match  any  of  the possible completions for that position, spelling correction does not
       register a misspelling.

       Like completion, spelling correction works anywhere in the line, pushing the rest  of  the  line  to  the
       right and possibly leaving extra characters to the right of the cursor.

   <b>Editor</b> <b>commands</b> <b>(+)</b>
       <b>bindkey</b>  lists  key  bindings  and  <b>bindkey</b>  <b>-l</b> lists and briefly describes editor commands.  Only new or
       especially interesting editor commands are described here.  See <u><a href="../man1/emacs.1.html">emacs</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1)  for  descriptions  of
       each editor's key bindings.

       The  character  or  characters  to  which  each  command  is  bound  by  default is given in parentheses.
       <b>^</b><u>character</u> means a control character and <b>M-</b><u>character</u> a meta  character,  typed  as  <b>escape-</b><u>character</u>  (or
       <b>^</b>[<u>character</u>)  on  terminals  without  a meta key.  Case counts, but commands that are bound to letters by
       default are bound to both lower- and uppercase letters for convenience.

       Supported editor commands are:

       <b>backward-char</b> (<b>^B</b>, <b>left</b>)
               Move back a character.  Cursor behavior modified by <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>backward-delete-word</b> (<b>M-^H</b>, <b>M-^?</b>)
               Cut from beginning of current word to cursor - saved  in  cut  buffer.   Word  boundary  behavior
               modified by <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>backward-word</b> (<b>M-b</b>, <b>M-B</b>)
               Move to beginning of current word.  Word boundary and cursor behavior modified by <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>beginning-of-line</b> (<b>^A</b>, <b>home</b>)
               Move to beginning of line.  Cursor behavior modified by <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>capitalize-word</b> (<b>M-c</b>, <b>M-C</b>)
               Capitalize the characters from cursor to end of current word.  Word boundary behavior modified by
               <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>complete-word</b> (<b>tab</b>)
               Completes a word as described under “Completion and listing (+)”.

       <b>complete-word-back</b> (not bound)
               Like <b>complete-word-fwd</b>, but steps up from the end of the list.

       <b>complete-word-fwd</b> (not bound)
               Replaces  the  current  word  with  the  first  word in the list of possible completions.  May be
               repeated to step down through the list.  At the end  of  the  list,  beeps  and  reverts  to  the
               incomplete word.

       <b>complete-word-raw</b> (<b>^X-tab</b>)
               Like <b>complete-word</b>, but ignores user-defined completions.

       <b>copy-prev-word</b> (<b>M-^_</b>)
               Copies  the  previous word in the current line into the input buffer.  See also <b>insert-last-word</b>.
               Word boundary behavior modified by <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>dabbrev-expand</b> (<b>M-/</b>)
               Expands the current word to the most recent preceding one for which  the  current  is  a  leading
               substring,  wrapping  around  the  history  list  (once)  if necessary.  Repeating <b>dabbrev-expand</b>
               without any intervening typing changes to the next previous word etc., skipping identical matches
               much like <b>history-search-backward</b> does.

       <b>delete-char</b> (not bound)
               Deletes the character under the cursor.  See also  <b>delete-char-or-list-or-eof</b>.   Cursor  behavior
               modified by <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>delete-char-or-eof</b> (not bound)
               Does  <b>delete-char</b>  if there is a character under the cursor or <b>end-of-file</b> on an empty line.  See
               also <b>delete-char-or-list-or-eof</b>.  Cursor behavior modified by <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>delete-char-or-list</b> (not bound)
               Does <b>delete-char</b> if there is a character under the cursor or <b>list-choices</b> at the end of the line.
               See also <b>delete-char-or-list-or-eof</b>.

       <b>delete-char-or-list-or-eof</b> (<b>^D</b>)
               Does <b>delete-char</b> if there is a character under the cursor, <b>list-choices</b> at the end of the line or
               <b>end-of-file</b> on an empty line.  See also those three commands, each of which does  only  a  single
               action,  and  <b>delete-char-or-eof</b>,  <b>delete-char-or-list</b>,  and  <b>list-or-eof</b>,  each  of which does a
               different two out of the three.

       <b>delete-word</b> (<b>M-d</b>, <b>M-D</b>)
               Cut from cursor to end of current word - save in cut buffer.  Word boundary behavior modified  by
               <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>down-history</b> (<b>down</b>, <b>^N</b>)
               Like <b>up-history</b>, but steps down, stopping at the original input line.

       <b>downcase-word</b> (<b>M-l</b>, <b>M-L</b>)
               Lowercase  the characters from cursor to end of current word.  Word boundary behavior modified by
               <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>end-of-file</b> (not bound)
               Signals an end of file, causing the shell to exit unless the <b>ignoreeof</b> shell variable is  set  to
               prevent this.  See also <b>delete-char-or-list-or-eof</b>.

       <b>end-of-line</b> (<b>^E</b>, <b>end</b>)
               Move cursor to end of line.  Cursor behavior modified by <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>expand-history</b> (<b>M-space</b>)
               Expands  history  substitutions  in  the  current  word.   See  “History substitution”.  See also
               <b>magic-space</b>, <b>toggle-literal-history</b>, and the <b>autoexpand</b> shell variable.

       <b>expand-glob</b> (<b>^X-*</b>)
               Expands the glob-pattern to the left of the cursor.  See “Filename substitution”.

       <b>expand-line</b> (not bound)
               Like <b>expand-history</b>, but expands history substitutions in each word in the input buffer.

       <b>expand-variables</b> (<b>^X-$</b>)
               Expands the variable to the left of the cursor.  See “Variable substitution”.

       <b>forward-char</b> (<b>^F</b>, <b>right</b>)
               Move forward one character.  Cursor behavior modified by <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>forward-word</b> (<b>M-f</b>, <b>M-F</b>)
               Move forward to end of current word.  Word boundary and cursor behavior modified by <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>history-search-backward</b> (<b>M-p</b>, <b>M-P</b>)
               Searches backwards through the history list for a command beginning with the current contents  of
               the  input buffer up to the cursor and copies it into the input buffer.  The search string may be
               a glob-pattern (see “Filename substitution”) containing ‘*’, ‘?’, ‘[]’, or ‘{}’.  <b>up-history</b>  and
               <b>down-history</b>  will proceed from the appropriate point in the history list.  Emacs mode only.  See
               also <b>history-search-forward</b> and <b>i-search-back</b>.

       <b>history-search-forward</b> (<b>M-n</b>, <b>M-N</b>)
               Like <b>history-search-backward</b>, but searches forward.

       <b>i-search-back</b> (not bound)
               Searches backward like <b>history-search-backward</b>, copies the first match into the input buffer with
               the cursor positioned at the end of the pattern, and prompts with
                     <b>bck:</b>
               and the first match.  Additional characters may be typed to extend the search, <b>i-search-back</b>  may
               be  typed  to  continue  searching  with  the  same  pattern, wrapping around the history list if
               necessary, (<b>i-search-back</b> must be bound to a single character for this to work)  or  one  of  the
               following special characters may be typed:

                     <b>Key</b>     <b>Behavior</b>

                     <b>^W</b>      Appends the rest of the word under the cursor to the search pattern.

                     <b>delete</b> (or any character bound to <b>backward-delete-char</b>)
                             Undoes  the  effect  of  the  last character typed and deletes a character from the
                             search pattern if appropriate.

                     <b>^G</b>      If the previous search was successful, aborts the entire search.  If not, goes back
                             to the last successful search.

                     <b>escape</b>  Ends the search, leaving the current line in the input buffer.

               Any other character not bound to <b>self-insert-command</b> terminates the search, leaving  the  current
               line  in  the  input  buffer, and is then interpreted as normal input.  In particular, a carriage
               return   causes   the   current   line   to   be   executed.    See   also    <b>i-search-fwd</b>    and
               <b>history-search-backward</b>.  Word boundary behavior modified by <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>i-search-fwd</b> (not bound)
               Like <b>i-search-back</b>, but searches forward.  Word boundary behavior modified by <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>insert-last-word</b> (<b>M-_</b>)
               Inserts  the  last  word  of  the  previous  input  line  (‘!$’) into the input buffer.  See also
               <b>copy-prev-word</b>.

       <b>list-choices</b> (<b>M-^D</b>)
               Lists completion possibilities as  described  under  “Completion  and  listing  (+)”.   See  also
               <b>delete-char-or-list-or-eof</b> and <b>list-choices-raw</b>.

       <b>list-choices-raw</b> (<b>^X-^D</b>)
               Like <b>list-choices</b>, but ignores user-defined completions.

       <b>list-glob</b> (<b>^X-g</b>, <b>^X-G</b>)
               Lists  (via  the  <b>ls-F</b>  builtin) matches to the glob-pattern (see “Filename substitution”) to the
               left of the cursor.

       <b>list-or-eof</b> (not bound)
               Does <b>list-choices</b> or <b>end-of-file</b> on an empty line.  See also <b>delete-char-or-list-or-eof</b>.

       <b>magic-space</b> (not bound)
               Expands history substitutions in the current line, like  <b>expand-history</b>,  and  inserts  a  space.
               <b>magic-space</b> is designed to be bound to the space bar, but is not bound by default.

       <b>normalize-command</b> (<b>^X-?</b>)
               Searches  for the current word in PATH and, if it is found, replaces it with the full path to the
               executable.  Special characters are quoted.  Aliases are expanded and quoted but commands  within
               aliases  are  not.   This  command is useful with commands that take commands as arguments, e.g.,
               ‘dbx’ and ‘sh -x’.

       <b>normalize-path</b> (<b>^X-n</b>, <b>^X-N</b>)
               Expands the current word as described under the ‘expand’ setting of the <b>symlinks</b> shell variable.

       <b>overwrite-mode</b> (unbound)
               Toggles between input and overwrite modes.

       <b>run-fg-editor</b> (<b>M-^Z</b>)
               Saves the current input line and looks for a stopped job where the file name portion of its first
               word is found in the <b>editors</b> shell variable.  If <b>editors</b> is not set, then the file  name  portion
               of  the  EDITOR environment variable (‘ed’ if unset) and the VISUAL environment variable (‘vi’ if
               unset) will be used.  If such a job is found, it is restarted as if ‘fg  %<u>job</u>’  had  been  typed.
               This  is  used to toggle back and forth between an editor and the shell easily.  Some people bind
               this command to <b>^Z</b> so they can do this even more easily.

       <b>run-help</b> (<b>M-h</b>, <b>M-H</b>)
               Searches for documentation on the current command, using the same notion of “current command”  as
               the completion routines, and prints it.  There is no way to use a pager; <b>run-help</b> is designed for
               short  help  files.  If the special alias <b>helpcommand</b> is defined, it is run with the command name
               as a sole argument.  Else, documentation should be  in  a  file  named  <u>command.help</u>,  <u>command.1</u>,
               <u>command.6</u>,  <u>command.8</u>,  or <u>command</u>, which should be in one of the directories listed in the HPATH
               environment variable.  If there is more than one help file only the first is printed.

       <b>self-insert-command</b> (text characters)
               In insert mode (the default), inserts the typed character into the input line after the character
               under the cursor.  In overwrite mode, replaces the character under  the  cursor  with  the  typed
               character.   The input mode is normally preserved between lines, but the <b>inputmode</b> shell variable
               can be set to ‘insert’ or ‘overwrite’ to put the editor in that mode at  the  beginning  of  each
               line.  See also <b>overwrite-mode</b>.

       <b>sequence-lead-in</b> (arrow prefix, meta prefix, <b>^X</b>)
               Indicates that the following characters are part of a multi-key sequence.  Binding a command to a
               multi-key  sequence  really creates two bindings: the first character to <b>sequence-lead-in</b> and the
               whole  sequence  to  the  command.   All  sequences  beginning  with   a   character   bound   to
               <b>sequence-lead-in</b> are effectively bound to <b>undefined-key</b> unless bound to another command.

       <b>spell-line</b> (<b>M-$</b>)
               Attempts  to  correct the spelling of each word in the input buffer, like <b>spell-word</b>, but ignores
               words whose first character is one of ‘-’, ‘!’, ‘^’, or ‘%’, or which contain ‘\’, ‘*’,  or  ‘?’,
               to avoid problems with switches, substitutions and the like.  See “Spelling correction (+)”.

       <b>spell-word</b> (<b>M-s</b>, <b>M-S</b>)
               Attempts  to  correct  the  spelling  of the current word as described under “Spelling correction
               (+)”.  Checks each component of a word which appears to be a pathname.

       <b>toggle-literal-history</b> (<b>M-r</b>, <b>M-R</b>)
               Expands or unexpands history substitutions in the input buffer.  See also <b>expand-history</b> and  the
               <b>autoexpand</b> shell variable.

       <b>undefined-key</b> (any unbound key)
               Beeps.

       <b>up-history</b> (<b>up</b>, <b>^P</b>)
               Copies the previous entry in the history list into the input buffer.  If <b>histlit</b> is set, uses the
               literal  form of the entry.  May be repeated to step up through the history list, stopping at the
               top.

       <b>upcase-word</b> (<b>M-u</b>, <b>M-U</b>)
               Uppercase the characters from cursor to end of current word.  Word boundary behavior modified  by
               <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>vi-beginning-of-next-word</b> (not bound)
               Vi goto the beginning of next word.  Word boundary and cursor behavior modified by <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>vi-eword</b> (not bound)
               Vi move to the end of the current word.  Word boundary behavior modified by <b>vimode</b>.

       <b>vi-search-back</b> (<b>?</b>)
               Prompts with
                     <b>?</b>
               for  a search string (which may be a glob-pattern, as with <b>history-search-backward</b>), searches for
               it and copies it into the input buffer.  The bell rings if no match  is  found.   Hitting  return
               ends  the  search  and leaves the last match in the input buffer.  Hitting escape ends the search
               and executes the match.  <b>vi</b> mode only.

       <b>vi-search-fwd</b> (<b>/</b>)
               Like <b>vi-search-back</b>, but searches forward.

       <b>which-command</b> (<b>M-?</b>)
               Does a <b>which</b> (see the description of the builtin command) on the first word of the input buffer.

       <b>yank-pop</b> (<b>M-y</b>)
               When executed immediately after a <b>yank</b> or another <b>yank-pop</b>, replaces the yanked string  with  the
               next  previous string from the killring.  This also has the effect of rotating the killring, such
               that this string will be considered the most recently killed by a later <b>yank</b> command.   Repeating
               <b>yank-pop</b> will cycle through the killring any number of times.

   <b>Lexical</b> <b>structure</b>
       The  shell  splits input lines into words at blanks and tabs.  The special characters ‘&amp;’, ‘|’, ‘;’, ‘&lt;’,
       ‘&gt;’, ‘(’, and ‘)’, and the doubled characters ‘&amp;&amp;’, ‘||’, ‘&lt;&lt;’,  and  ‘&gt;&gt;’  are  always  separate  words,
       whether or not they are surrounded by whitespace.

       When  the  shell's  input is not a terminal, the character ‘#’ is taken to begin a comment.  Each ‘#’ and
       the rest of the input line on which it appears is discarded before further parsing.

       A special character (including a blank or tab) may be prevented from  having  its  special  meaning,  and
       possibly  made  part  of  another  word, by preceding it with a backslash (‘\’) or enclosing it in single
       (‘'’), double (‘"’), or backward (‘`’) quotes.  When not otherwise quoted a newline preceded by a ‘\’  is
       equivalent to a blank, but inside quotes this sequence results in a newline.

       Furthermore,  all “Substitutions” except “History substitution” can be prevented by enclosing the strings
       (or parts of strings) in which they appear with single quotes or  by  quoting  the  crucial  character(s)
       (e.g.,  ‘$’ or ‘`’ for “Variable substitution” or “Command substitution” respectively) with ‘\’.  (“Alias
       substitution” is no exception: quoting in any way any character of a word for which  an  <b>alias</b>  has  been
       defined  prevents  substitution  of the alias.  The usual way of quoting an alias is to precede it with a
       backslash.)  “History substitution” is prevented by backslashes but not by single quotes.  Strings quoted
       with double or backward quotes undergo “Variable substitution”  and  “Command  substitution”,  but  other
       substitutions are prevented.

       Text  inside  single  or  double  quotes becomes a single word (or part of one).  Metacharacters in these
       strings, including blanks and tabs, do not form separate words.  Only in one special case  (see  “Command
       substitution”)  can a double-quoted string yield parts of more than one word; single-quoted strings never
       do.  Backward quotes are special: they signal “Command substitution”, which may result in more  than  one
       word.

       C-style  escape  sequences  can be used in single quoted strings by preceding the leading quote with ‘$’.
       (+) See “Escape sequences (+)” for a complete list of recognized escape sequences.

       Quoting complex strings, particularly  strings  which  themselves  contain  quoting  characters,  can  be
       confusing.   Remember  that  quotes  need  not be used as they are in human writing!  It may be easier to
       quote not an entire string, but only those parts of the string which need quoting, using different  types
       of quoting to do so if appropriate.

       The  <b>backslash_quote</b>  shell  variable  can be set to make backslashes always quote ‘\’, ‘'’, and ‘"’ (+).
       This may make complex quoting tasks easier, but it can cause syntax errors in <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) scripts.

   <b>Escape</b> <b>sequences</b> <b>(+)</b>
       The following escape sequences are always  recognized  inside  a  string  constructed  using  ‘$''’,  and
       optionally by the <b>echo</b> builtin command as controlled by the <b>echo_style</b> shell variable.

       Supported escape sequences are:

             <b>Escape</b>        <b>Description</b>

             <b>\a</b>            Bell.

             <b>\b</b>            Backspace.

             <b>\c</b><u>c</u>           The  control  character  denoted by ‘^<u>c</u>’ in <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1).  If <u>c</u> is a backslash, it must be
                           doubled.

             <b>\e</b>            Escape.

             <b>\f</b>            Form feed.

             <b>\n</b>            Newline.

             <b>\r</b>            Carriage return.

             <b>\t</b>            Horizontal tab.

             <b>\v</b>            Vertical tab.

             <b>\\</b>            Literal backslash.

             <b>\'</b>            Literal single quote.

             <b>\"</b>            Literal double quote.

             <b>\</b><u>nnn</u>          The character corresponding to the octal number <u>nnn</u>.

             <b>\x</b><u>nn</u>          The character corresponding to the hexadecimal number <u>nn</u> (1-2 hexadecimal digits).

             <b>\x{</b><u>nnnnnnnn</u><b>}</b>  The character corresponding to  the  hexadecimal  number  <u>nnnnnnnn</u>  (1-8  hexadecimal
                           digits).

             <b>\u</b><u>nnnn</u>        The Unicode code point <u>nnnn</u> (1-4 hexadecimal digits).

             <b>\U</b><u>nnnnnnnn</u>    The Unicode code point <u>nnnnnnnn</u> (1-8 hexadecimal digits).

       The  implementations  of ‘\x’, ‘\u’, and ‘\U’ in other shells may take a varying number of digits.  It is
       often safest to use leading zeros to provide the maximum expected number of digits.

   <b>Substitutions</b>
       We now describe the various transformations the shell performs on the input in the order  in  which  they
       occur.  We note in passing the data structures involved and the commands and variables which affect them.
       Remember that substitutions can be prevented by quoting as described under “Lexical structure”.

   <b>History</b> <b>substitution</b>
       Each  command, or “event”, input from the terminal is saved in the history list.  The previous command is
       always saved, and the <b>history</b> shell variable can be set to a number to  save  that  many  commands.   The
       <b>histdup</b> shell variable can be set to not save duplicate events or consecutive duplicate events.

       Saved  commands  are numbered sequentially from 1 and stamped with the time.  It is not usually necessary
       to use event numbers, but the current event number can be made part of the prompt by placing  an  ‘!’  in
       the <b>prompt</b> shell variable.

       By  default  history  entries  are  displayed  by printing each parsed token separated by space; thus the
       redirection operator ‘&gt;&amp;!’ will be displayed as ‘&gt; &amp; !’.  The shell actually saves  history  in  expanded
       and  literal  (unexpanded)  forms.  If the <b>histlit</b> shell variable is set, commands that display and store
       history use the literal form.

       The <b>history</b> builtin command can print, store in a file, restore and clear the history list at  any  time,
       and  the  <b>savehist</b>  and  <b>histfile</b>  shell  variables can be set to store the history list automatically on
       logout and restore it on login.

       History substitutions introduce words from the history list into the input  stream,  making  it  easy  to
       repeat  commands, repeat arguments of a previous command in the current command, or fix spelling mistakes
       in the previous command with little typing and a high degree of confidence.

       History substitutions begin with the character ‘!’.  They may begin anywhere in  the  input  stream,  but
       they  do  not  nest.  The ‘!’ may be preceded by a ‘\’ to prevent its special meaning; for convenience, a
       ‘!’ is passed unchanged when it is followed by a blank, tab, newline, ‘=’ or ‘(’.

       History substitutions also  occur  when  an  input  line  begins  with  ‘^’;  see  “History  substitution
       abbreviation”.

       The  characters used to signal history substitution (‘!’ and ‘^’) can be changed by setting the <b>histchars</b>
       shell variable.  Any input line which contains a history substitution is printed before it is executed.

       A history substitution may have an “event  specification”  (see  “History  event  specification”),  which
       indicates  the  event  from  which  words  are  to  be  taken,  a  “word  designator”  (see “History word
       designators”), which selects particular words from the  chosen  event,  and/or  a  “word  modifier”  (see
       “History word modifiers”), which manipulates the selected words.

   <b>History</b> <b>event</b> <b>specification</b>
       A history event specification may be one of (with the history substitution character ‘!’ shown):

             <b>!Event</b>  <b>History</b> <b>event</b> <b>specification</b>

             <b>!</b><u>n</u>      A number, referring to a particular event.

             <b>!-</b><u>n</u>     An offset, referring to the event <u>n</u> before the current event.

             <b>!#</b>      The  current  event.   This should be used carefully in <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1), where there is no check for
                     recursion.  <b>tcsh</b> allows 10 levels of recursion. (+)

             <b>!!</b>      The previous event, equivalent to ‘!-1’.

             <b>!</b><u>s</u>      The most recent event whose first word begins with the string <u>s</u>.

             <b>!?</b><u>s</u><b>?</b>    The most recent event which contains the string <u>s</u>.  The second ‘?’ can be omitted if it  is
                     immediately followed by a newline.

       For example, consider this bit of someone's history list:

              9  8:30    nroff -man wumpus.man
             10  8:31    cp wumpus.man wumpus.man.old
             11  8:36    vi wumpus.man
             12  8:37    diff wumpus.man.old wumpus.man

       The  commands  are  shown  with their event numbers and time stamps.  The current event, which we haven't
       typed in yet, is event 13.

       Typing
             <b>!11</b>
       or
             <b>!-2</b>
       refers to event 11.

       Typing
             <b>!!</b>
       refers to the previous event, 12.  ‘!!’ can be abbreviated ‘!’  if  it  is  followed  by  ‘:’,  which  is
       described in “History word designators” and “History word modifiers”.

       Typing
             <b>!n</b>
       refers to event 9, which begins with ‘n’.

       Typing
             <b>!?old?</b>
       refers to event 12, which contains ‘old’.

       Without  word  designators or modifiers history references simply expand to the entire event, so we might
       type
             <b>!cp</b>
       to redo the ‘cp’ command (event 10) or
             <b>!!|more</b>
       if the ‘diff’ output in the previous event, 12, scrolled off the top of the screen.

       History references may be insulated from the surrounding text with braces (‘{’  and  ‘}’)  if  necessary.
       For example,
             <b>!vdoc</b>
       would look for a command beginning with ‘vdoc’, and, in this example, not find one, but
             <b>!{v}doc</b>
       would  expand  unambiguously  to  ‘vi  wumpus.mandoc’  by  matching  event  11.   Even in braces, history
       substitutions do not nest.

       (+) While <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) expands, for example,
             <b>!3d</b>
       to event 3 with the letter ‘d’ appended to it, <b>tcsh</b> expands it to the last  event  beginning  with  ‘3d’;
       only  completely numeric arguments are treated as event numbers.  This makes it possible to recall events
       beginning with numbers.  To expand
             <b>!3d</b>
       as in <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) type
             <b>!{3}d</b>

   <b>History</b> <b>word</b> <b>designators</b>
       To select words from an event we can follow the event specification by a ‘:’ and  a  designator  for  the
       desired words.  The words of an input line are numbered from 0, the first (usually command) word being 0,
       the second word (first argument) being 1, etc.

       The  basic  word  designators  are, with columns for a leading ‘:’ and a leading ‘!’ (for the abbreviated
       word designators - see “History substitution abbreviation”):

             <b>:Word</b>    <b>!Word</b>    <b>History</b> <b>word</b> <b>designator</b>

             <b>:0</b>                The first (command) word.

             <b>:</b><u>n</u>                The <u>n</u>th argument.

             <b>:^</b>       <b>!^</b>       The first argument, equivalent to ‘<b>:1</b>’.

             <b>:$</b>       <b>!$</b>       The last argument.

             <b>:%</b>       <b>!%</b>       The word matched by an <b>?</b><u>s</u><b>?</b> search.

             <b>:</b><u>x</u><b>-</b><u>y</u>              A range of words.

             <b>:-</b><u>y</u>      <b>!-</b><u>y</u>      Equivalent to ‘<b>:0-</b><u>y</u>’.

             <b>:*</b>       <b>!*</b>       Equivalent to ‘<b>:^-$</b>’, but returns nothing if the event contains only 1 word.

             <b>:</b><u>x</u><b>*</b>               Equivalent to ‘<b>:</b><u>x</u><b>-$</b>’.

             <b>:</b><u>x</u><b>-</b>               Equivalent to ‘<b>:</b><u>x</u><b>*</b>’, but omitting the last word (‘$’).

             <b>:-</b>                Equivalent to ‘<b>:0-</b>’; the command and all arguments except the last argument.

       Selected words are inserted into the command line separated by single blanks.

       For example, the ‘diff’ command (event 12) in the history list example in “History event specification”,
             <b>diff</b> <b>wumpus.man.old</b> <b>wumpus.man</b>
       might have been typed as
             <b>diff</b> <b>!!:1.old</b> <b>!!:1</b>
       (using ‘:1’ to select the first argument from the previous event) or
             <b>diff</b> <b>!-2:2</b> <b>!-2:1</b>
       to select and swap the arguments from the ‘cp’ command (event 10).  If we didn't care about the order  of
       the ‘diff’ we might have typed
             <b>diff</b> <b>!-2:1-2</b>
       or simply
             <b>diff</b> <b>!-2:*</b>

       The ‘cp’ command (event 10) might have been typed
             <b>cp</b> <b>wumpus.man</b> <b>!#:1.old</b>
       using ‘#’ to refer to the current event.

       Typing
             <b>!n:-</b> <b>hurkle.man</b>
       would reuse the first two words from the ‘nroff’ command (event 9) to expand to
             <b>nroff</b> <b>-man</b> <b>hurkle.man</b>

       The  ‘:’  separating  the  event  specification  from  the word designator can be omitted if the argument
       selector begins with a ‘^’, ‘$’, ‘%’, ‘-’, or ‘*’.

       For example, our ‘diff’ command (event 12) might have been typed
             <b>diff</b> <b>!!^.old</b> <b>!!^</b>
       or, equivalently,
             <b>diff</b> <b>!!$.old</b> <b>!!$</b>
       However, if ‘!!’ is abbreviated ‘!’, an argument selector beginning with ‘-’ will be  interpreted  as  an
       event specification.

       A  history  reference  may  have  a  word  designator but no event specification.  It then references the
       previous command.

       Continuing our ‘diff’ command example (event 12), we could have typed simply
             <b>diff</b> <b>!^.old</b> <b>!^</b>
       or, to get the arguments in the opposite order, just
             <b>diff</b> <b>!*</b>

   <b>History</b> <b>word</b> <b>modifiers</b>
       The word or words in a history reference can be edited, or “modified”, by following it with one  or  more
       modifiers (with the leading ‘:’ shown), each preceded by a ‘:’:

             <b>:Word</b>    <b>History</b> <b>word</b> <b>modifier</b>

             <b>:h</b>       Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving the head.

             <b>:t</b>       Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.

             <b>:r</b>       Remove a filename extension ‘.<u>xxx</u>’, leaving the root name.

             <b>:e</b>       Remove all but the extension.

             <b>:u</b>       Uppercase the first lowercase letter.

             <b>:l</b>       Lowercase the first uppercase letter.

             <b>:s/</b><u>l</u><b>/</b><u>r</u><b>/</b>  Substitute  <u>l</u>  for  <u>r</u>.   <u>l</u>  is  simply a string like <u>r</u>, not a regular expression as in the
                      eponymous <u><a href="../man1/ed.1.html">ed</a></u>(1) command.  Any character may be used as the delimiter in place  of  ‘/’;  a
                      ‘\’  can  be  used  to  quote the delimiter inside <u>l</u> and <u>r</u>.  The character ‘&amp;’ in the <u>r</u> is
                      replaced by <u>l</u>; ‘\’ also  quotes  ‘&amp;’.   If  <u>l</u>  is  empty  (‘’),  the  <u>l</u>  from  a  previous
                      substitution  or  the  <u>s</u>  from a previous search or event number in event specification is
                      used.  The trailing delimiter may be omitted if it is immediately followed by a newline.

             <b>:&amp;</b>       Repeat the previous substitution.

             <b>:g</b>       Apply the following modifier once to each word.

             <b>:a</b> (+)   Apply the following modifier as many times as possible to a single word.   ‘:a’  and  ‘:g’
                      can  be  used  together  to  apply  a modifier globally.  With the ‘:s’ modifier, only the
                      patterns contained in the original word are substituted, not  patterns  that  contain  any
                      substitution result.

             <b>:p</b>       Print the new command line but do not execute it.

             <b>:q</b>       Quote the substituted words, preventing further substitutions.

             <b>:Q</b>       Same  as ‘:q’ but in addition preserve empty variables as a string containing a NUL.  This
                      is useful to preserve positional arguments for example:
                            &gt; set args=('arg 1' '' 'arg 3')
                            &gt; tcsh -f -c 'echo ${#argv}' $args:gQ
                            3

             <b>:x</b>       Like ‘:q’, but break into words at blanks, tabs and newlines.

       Modifiers are applied to only the first modifiable word (unless ‘:g’ is used).  It is  an  error  for  no
       word to be modifiable.

       For example, the ‘diff’ command (event 12) in the history list example in “History event specification”,
             <b>diff</b> <b>wumpus.man.old</b> <b>wumpus.man</b>
       might have been typed as
             <b>diff</b> <b>wumpus.man.old</b> <b>!#^:r</b>
       using ‘:r’ to remove ‘.old’ from the first argument on the same line (‘!#^’).

       We could type
             <b>echo</b> <b>hello</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b>
       then
             <b>echo</b> <b>!*:u</b>
       to capitalize ‘hello’,
             <b>echo</b> <b>!*:au</b>
       to upper case the first word to ‘HELLO’, or
             <b>echo</b> <b>!*:agu</b>
       to upper case all words.

       We might follow
             <b>mail</b> <b>-s</b> <b>"I</b> <b>forgot</b> <b>my</b> <b>password"</b> <b>rot</b>
       with
             <b>!:s/rot/root</b>
       to  correct  the  spelling  of  ‘root’  (see  “History  word modifiers” and “Spelling correction (+)” for
       different approaches).

       (+) In <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) as such, only one modifier may be applied to each history or variable expansion.  In  <b>tcsh</b>,
       more than one may be used, for example

             % mv wumpus.man /usr/share/man/man1/wumpus.1
             % man !$:t:r
             man wumpus

       In <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1), the result would be
             <b>wumpus.1:r</b>

       A substitution followed by a ‘:’ may need to be insulated from it with braces:

             &gt; mv a.out /usr/games/wumpus
             &gt; setenv PATH !$:h:$PATH
             Bad ! modifier: $.
             &gt; setenv PATH !{-2$:h}:$PATH
             setenv PATH <a href="file:/usr/games">/usr/games</a>:<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>:.

       The  first attempt would succeed in <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) but fails in <b>tcsh</b>, because <b>tcsh</b> expects another modifier after
       the second ‘:’ rather than ‘$’.

   <b>History</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>abbreviation</b>
       There is a special abbreviation for substitutions; ‘^’, when it is the first character on an input  line,
       is equivalent to ‘!:s^’.  Thus, we might follow the example from “History word modifiers”
             <b>mail</b> <b>-s</b> <b>"I</b> <b>forgot</b> <b>my</b> <b>password"</b> <b>rot</b>
       with
             <b>^rot^root</b>
       to  make  the spelling correction.  This is the only history substitution which does not explicitly begin
       with ‘!’.

   <b>History</b> <b>editor</b> <b>commands</b>
       Finally, history can be accessed through the editor as well as through the substitutions just  described.
       The  <b>up-history</b>  and  <b>down-history</b>, <b>history-search-backward</b> and <b>history-search-forward</b>, <b>i-search-back</b> and
       <b>i-search-fwd</b>, <b>vi-search-back</b> and  <b>vi-search-fwd</b>,  <b>copy-prev-word</b>  and  <b>insert-last-word</b>  editor  commands
       search  for  events  in the history list and copy them into the input buffer.  The <b>toggle-literal-history</b>
       editor command switches between the expanded and literal forms of history  lines  in  the  input  buffer.
       <b>expand-history</b>  and  <b>expand-line</b> expand history substitutions in the current word and in the entire input
       buffer respectively.

   <b>Alias</b> <b>substitution</b>
       The shell maintains a list of aliases which can be set, unset  and  printed  by  the  <b>alias</b>  and  <b>unalias</b>
       commands.   After  a  command line is parsed into simple commands (see “Commands”) the first word of each
       command, left-to-right, is checked to see if it has an alias.  If so, the first word is replaced  by  the
       alias.   If  the  alias  contains  a history reference, it undergoes “History substitution” as though the
       original command were the previous input line.  If the alias does not contain a  history  reference,  the
       argument list is left untouched.

       Thus if the alias for ‘ls’ were
             <b>ls</b> <b>-l</b>
       the command
             <b>ls</b> <b><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></b>
       would become
             <b>ls</b> <b>-l</b> <b><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></b>
       the argument list here being undisturbed.

       If the alias for ‘lookup’ were
             <b>grep</b> <b>!^</b> <b><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></b>
       then
             <b>lookup</b> <b>bill</b>
       would become
             <b>grep</b> <b>bill</b> <b><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></b>

       Aliases can be used to introduce parser metasyntax.  For example,
             <b>alias</b> <b>print</b> <b>'pr</b> <b>\!*</b> | <b>lpr'</b>
       defines a “command” (‘print’) which <u><a href="../man1/pr.1.html">pr</a></u>(1)s its arguments to the line printer.

       Alias  substitution  is  repeated  until  the  first  word  of  the  command  has  no alias.  If an alias
       substitution does not change the first word (as in the previous example) it is flagged to prevent a loop.
       Other loops are detected and cause an error.

       Some aliases are referred to by the shell; see “Special aliases (+)”.

   <b>Variable</b> <b>substitution</b>
       The shell maintains a list of variables, each of which has as value a list of zero or  more  words.   The
       values  of  shell  variables  can  be  displayed and changed with the <b>set</b> and <b>unset</b> commands.  The system
       maintains its own list of “environment” variables.  These can be displayed  and  changed  with  <b>printenv</b>,
       <b>setenv</b>, and <b>unsetenv</b>.

       (+) Variables may be made read-only with
             <b>set</b> <b>-r</b>
       Read-only  variables  may  not  be modified or unset; attempting to do so will cause an error.  Once made
       read-only, a variable cannot be made writable, so
             <b>set</b> <b>-r</b>
       should be used with caution.  Environment variables cannot be made read-only.

       Some variables are set by the shell or referred to by it.  For instance, the <b>argv</b> variable is an image of
       the shell's argument list, and words of this variable's value are referred to in special ways.   Some  of
       the  variables  referred  to  by the shell are toggles; the shell does not care what their value is, only
       whether they are set or not.  For instance, the <b>verbose</b> variable is a toggle which causes  command  input
       to  be  echoed.   The  <b>-v</b>  command  line  option sets this variable.  “Special shell variables” lists all
       variables which are referred to by the shell.

       Other operations treat variables numerically.   The  ‘<b>@</b>’  command  permits  numeric  calculations  to  be
       performed  and  the  result  assigned to a variable.  Variable values are, however, always represented as
       (zero or more) strings.  For the purposes of numeric operations, the null  string  is  considered  to  be
       zero, and the second and subsequent words of multi-word values are ignored.

       After the input line is aliased and parsed, and before each command is executed, variable substitution is
       performed  keyed  by  ‘$’  characters.   This  expansion can be prevented by preceding the ‘$’ with a ‘\’
       except within ‘"’ pairs where it <u>always</u> occurs, and within ‘'’ pairs  where  it  <u>never</u>  occurs.   Strings
       quoted by ‘`’ are interpreted later (see “Command substitution”) so ‘$’ substitution does not occur there
       until later, if at all.  A ‘$’ is passed unchanged if followed by a blank, tab, or end-of-line.

       Input/output redirections are recognized before variable expansion, and are variable expanded separately.
       Otherwise,  the command name and entire argument list are expanded together.  It is thus possible for the
       first (command) word (to this point) to generate more than one word,  the  first  of  which  becomes  the
       command name, and the rest of which become arguments.

       Unless  enclosed in ‘"’ or given the ‘:q’ modifier the results of variable substitution may eventually be
       command and filename substituted.  Within ‘"’, a variable whose value consists of multiple words  expands
       to  a  (portion  of a) single word, with the words of the variable's value separated by blanks.  When the
       ‘:q’ modifier is applied to a substitution the variable will expand to  multiple  words  with  each  word
       separated by a blank and quoted to prevent later command or filename substitution.

       The  editor  command  <b>expand-variables</b>,  normally  bound  to  <b>^X-$</b>,  can  be used to interactively expand
       individual variables.

   <b>Variable</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>metasequences</b>
       The following metasequences are provided for introducing variable values into the shell input:

             <b>$</b><u>name</u>
             <b>${</b><u>name</u><b>}</b>    Substitutes the words of the value of variable <u>name</u>, each separated by a blank.   Braces
                        insulate  <u>name</u>  from  following  characters  which would otherwise be part of it.  Shell
                        variables have names consisting of letters and  digits  starting  with  a  letter.   The
                        underscore  character  is  considered a letter.  If <u>name</u> is not a shell variable, but is
                        set in the environment, then that value is returned (but some of the other  forms  given
                        below are not available in this case).

             <b>$</b><u>name</u><b>[</b><u>selector</u><b>]</b>
             <b>${</b><u>name</u><b>[</b><u>selector</u><b>]}</b>
                        Substitutes  only  the selected words from the value of <u>name</u>.  The <u>selector</u> is subjected
                        to ‘$’ substitution and may consist of a single number or two  numbers  separated  by  a
                        ‘-’.   The  first  word of a variable's value is numbered ‘1’.  If the first number of a
                        range is omitted it defaults to ‘1’.  If the last  member  of  a  range  is  omitted  it
                        defaults  to  ‘$#<u>name</u>’.   The  <u>selector</u> ‘*’ selects all words.  It is not an error for a
                        range to be empty if the second argument is omitted or in range.

             <b>$0</b>         Substitutes the name of the file from which command  input  is  being  read.   An  error
                        occurs if the name is not known.

             <b>$</b><u>number</u>
             <b>${</b><u>number</u><b>}</b>  Equivalent to ‘$argv[<u>number</u><b>]</b>’.

             <b>$*</b>         Equivalent to ‘$argv’, which is equivalent to ‘$argv[*]’.

       Except as noted, it is an error to reference a variable which is not set.

       The  ‘:’  modifiers  described  under  “History  word  modifiers”, except for ‘:p’, can be applied to the
       substitutions above.  More than one may be used.  (+)  Braces  may  be  needed  to  insulate  a  variable
       substitution  from  a literal ‘:’ just as with “History word modifiers”; any modifiers must appear within
       the braces.

   <b>Variable</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>without</b> <b>modifiers</b>
       The following substitutions cannot be modified with ‘:’ modifiers:

             <b>$?</b><u>name</u>
             <b>${?</b><u>name</u><b>}</b>    Substitutes the string ‘1’ if <u>name</u> is set, ‘0’ if it is not.

             <b>$?0</b>         Substitutes ‘1’ if the current input filename is known, ‘0’ if it is not.   Always  ‘0’
                         in interactive shells.

             <b>$#</b><u>name</u>
             <b>${#</b><u>name</u><b>}</b>    Substitutes the number of words in <u>name</u>.

             <b>$#</b>          Equivalent to ‘$#argv’.  (+)

             <b>$%</b><u>name</u>
             <b>${%</b><u>name</u><b>}</b>    Substitutes the number of characters in <u>name</u>.  (+)

             <b>$%</b><u>number</u>
             <b>${%</b><u>number</u><b>}</b>  Substitutes the number of characters in ‘$argv[<u>number</u><b>]</b>’.  (+)

             <b>$?</b>          Equivalent to ‘$status’.  (+)

             <b>$$</b>          Substitutes the (decimal) process number of the (parent) shell.

             <b>$!</b>          Substitutes the (decimal) process number of the last background process started by this
                         shell.  (+)

             <b>$_</b>          Substitutes the command line of the last command executed.  (+)

             <b>$&lt;</b>          Substitutes  a line from the standard input, with no further interpretation thereafter.
                         It can be used to read from the keyboard in a shell script.  (+)  While  <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1)  always
                         quotes ‘$&lt;’, as if it were equivalent to ‘$&lt;:q’, <b>tcsh</b> does not.  Furthermore, when <b>tcsh</b>
                         is  waiting  for  a  line  to  be typed the user may type an interrupt to interrupt the
                         sequence into which the line is to be substituted, but <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) does not allow this.

             <b>$?&lt;</b>         Substitutes the number of available bytes from the standard input.  (This feature might
                         be non-portable.)  (+)

   <b>Command,</b> <b>filename</b> <b>and</b> <b>directory</b> <b>stack</b> <b>substitution</b>
       The remaining substitutions are applied selectively to the arguments of  builtin  commands.   This  means
       that portions of expressions which are not evaluated are not subjected to these expansions.  For commands
       which  are  not internal to the shell, the command name is substituted separately from the argument list.
       This occurs very late, after input-output redirection is performed, and in a child of the main shell.

   <b>Command</b> <b>substitution</b>
       Command substitution is indicated by a command enclosed in ‘`’.  The output from such a command is broken
       into separate words at blanks, tabs and newlines, and null words are discarded.  The output  is  variable
       and command substituted and put in place of the original string.

       Command  substitutions  inside double quotes (‘"’) retain blanks and tabs; only newlines force new words.
       The single final newline does not force a new word in any case.   It  is  thus  possible  for  a  command
       substitution to yield only part of a word, even if the command outputs a complete line.

       By  default,  the  shell  since  version  6.12 replaces all newline and carriage return characters in the
       command by spaces.  If this is switched off by unsetting <b>csubstnonl</b>, newlines separate commands as usual.

   <b>Filename</b> <b>substitution</b>
       If a word contains any of the characters ‘*’, ‘?’, ‘[’, or ‘{’ or begins with the character ‘~’ it  is  a
       candidate  for  filename substitution, also known as “globbing”.  This word is then regarded as a pattern
       (“glob-pattern”), and replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of file names which match the pattern.

       In matching filenames, the character ‘.’ at the beginning of a filename or immediately following  a  ‘/’,
       as  well  as  the character ‘/’ must be matched explicitly (unless either <b>globdot</b> or <b>globstar</b> or both are
       set (+)).  The character ‘*’ matches any string of characters, including the null string.  The  character
       ‘?’  matches  any  single  character.   The  sequence ‘[...]’ matches any one of the characters enclosed.
       Within ‘[...]’, a pair of characters separated by ‘-’ matches any character lexically between the two.

       (+) Some glob-patterns can be negated: The sequence ‘[^...]’ matches any single character  <u>not</u>  specified
       by the characters and/or ranges of characters in the braces.

       An entire glob-pattern can also be negated with ‘^’:

             &gt; echo *
             bang crash crunch ouch
             &gt; echo ^cr*
             bang ouch

       Glob-patterns  which  do  not  use  ‘?’,  ‘*’,  or ‘[]’, or which use ‘{}’ or ‘~’ (below) are not negated
       correctly.

       The metanotation ‘a{b,c,d}e’ is a shorthand for ‘abe ace ade’.  Left-to-right order is preserved:
             <b>/usr/source/s1/{oldls,ls}.c</b>
       expands to
             <b>/usr/source/s1/oldls.c</b> <b>/usr/source/s1/ls.c</b>
       The results of matches are sorted separately at a low level to preserve this order:
             <b>../{memo,*box}</b>
       might expand to
             <b>../memo</b> <b>../box</b> <b>../mbox</b>
       (Note that ‘memo’ was not sorted with the results of matching ‘*box’.)  It is  not  an  error  when  this
       construct expands to files which do not exist, but it is possible to get an error from a command to which
       the  expanded  list  is passed.  This construct may be nested.  As a special case the words ‘{’, ‘}’, and
       ‘{}’ are passed undisturbed.

       The character ‘~’ at the beginning of a filename refers to home directories.  Standing alone, i.e.,  ‘~’,
       it  expands  to  the invoker's home directory as reflected in the value of the <b>home</b> shell variable.  When
       followed by a name consisting of letters, digits and ‘-’ characters the shell searches for  a  user  with
       that name and substitutes their home directory; thus
             <b>~ken</b>
       might expand to
             <b>/usr/ken</b>
       and
             <b>~ken/chmach</b>
       might expand to
             <b>/usr/ken/chmach</b>
       If  the  character ‘~’ is followed by a character other than a letter or ‘/’ or appears elsewhere than at
       the beginning of a word, it is left undisturbed.  A command like
             <b>setenv</b> <b>MANPATH</b> <b><a href="file:/usr/share/man">/usr/share/man</a>:<a href="file:/usr/local/share/man">/usr/local/share/man</a>:<a href="file:~/lib/man">~/lib/man</a></b>
       does not, therefore, do home directory substitution as one might hope.

       It is an error for a glob-pattern containing ‘*’, ‘?’, ‘[’, or ‘~’, with or without ‘^’, not to match any
       files.  However, only one pattern in a list of glob-patterns must match a file (so that, e.g.,
             <b>rm</b> <b>*.a</b> <b>*.c</b> <b>*.o</b>
       would fail only if there were no files in the current directory ending in ‘.a’, ‘.c’, or  ‘.o’),  and  if
       the  <b>nonomatch</b>  shell  variable  is  set  a  pattern  (or list of patterns) which matches nothing is left
       unchanged rather than causing an error.

       The <b>globstar</b> shell variable can be set to allow ‘**’ or ‘***’ as a file glob  pattern  that  matches  any
       string of characters including ‘/’, recursively traversing any existing sub-directories.  For example,
             <b>ls</b> <b>**.c</b>
       will  list all the .c files in the current directory tree.  If used by itself, it will match zero or more
       sub-directories.  For example
             <b>ls</b> <b><a href="file:/usr/include/">/usr/include/</a>**/time.h</b>
       will list any file named ‘time.h’ in the <u><a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a></u> directory tree;
             <b>ls</b> <b><a href="file:/usr/include/">/usr/include/</a>**time.h</b>
       will match any file in the <u><a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a></u> directory tree ending in ‘time.h’; and
             <b>ls</b> <b><a href="file:/usr/include/">/usr/include/</a>**time**.h</b>
       will match any .h file with ‘time’ either in a subdirectory name or in the filename itself.   To  prevent
       problems  with  recursion,  the  ‘**’  glob-pattern  will  not  descend into a symbolic link containing a
       directory.  To override this, use ‘***’ (+)

       The <b>noglob</b> shell variable can be set  to  prevent  filename  substitution,  and  the  <b>expand-glob</b>  editor
       command, normally bound to <b>^X-*</b>, can be used to interactively expand individual filename substitutions.

   <b>Directory</b> <b>stack</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>(+)</b>
       The  directory  stack  is  a  list  of directories, numbered from zero, used by the <b>pushd</b>, <b>popd</b>, and <b>dirs</b>
       builtin commands.  <b>dirs</b> can print, store in a file, restore and clear the directory stack  at  any  time,
       and  the  <b>savedirs</b>  and <b>dirsfile</b> shell variables can be set to store the directory stack automatically on
       logout and restore it on login.  The <b>dirstack</b> shell variable can be examined to see the  directory  stack
       and set to put arbitrary directories into the directory stack.

       The character ‘=’ followed by one or more digits expands to an entry in the directory stack.  The special
       case ‘=-’ expands to the last directory in the stack.  For example,

             &gt; dirs -v
             0       <a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>
             1       /usr/spool/uucp
             2       /usr/accts/sys
             &gt; echo =1
             /usr/spool/uucp
             &gt; echo =0/calendar
             /usr/bin/calendar
             &gt; echo =-
             /usr/accts/sys

       The  <b>noglob</b>  and <b>nonomatch</b> shell variables and the <b>expand-glob</b> editor command apply to directory stack as
       well as filename substitutions.

   <b>Other</b> <b>substitutions</b> <b>(+)</b>
       There are several more transformations involving  filenames,  not  strictly  related  to  the  above  but
       mentioned  here for completeness.  <u>Any</u> filename may be expanded to a full path when the <b>symlinks</b> variable
       is set to ‘expand’.  Quoting prevents this expansion, and the <b>normalize-path</b> editor command  does  it  on
       demand.   The  <b>normalize-command</b>  editor  command  expands  commands  in  PATH into full paths on demand.
       Finally, <b>cd</b> and <b>pushd</b> interpret ‘-’ as the old working directory (equivalent to the shell variable  <b>owd</b>).
       This  is  not a substitution at all, but an abbreviation recognized by only those commands.  Nonetheless,
       it too can be prevented by quoting.

   <b>Commands</b>
       The next three sections describe how the shell executes commands and deals with their input and output.

   <b>Simple</b> <b>commands,</b> <b>pipelines</b> <b>and</b> <b>sequences</b>
       A simple command is a sequence of words, the first of which specifies the  command  to  be  executed.   A
       series  of  simple  commands  joined by ‘|’ characters forms a pipeline.  The output of each command in a
       pipeline is connected to the input of the next.

       Simple commands and pipelines may be joined into sequences with ‘;’, and will be  executed  sequentially.
       Commands  and  pipelines  can  also  be  joined into sequences with ‘||’ or ‘&amp;&amp;’, indicating, as in the C
       language, that the second is to be executed only if the first fails or succeeds respectively.

       A simple command, pipeline or sequence may be placed in parentheses  (‘(’  and  ‘)’)  to  form  a  simple
       command, which may in turn be a component of a pipeline or sequence.  A command, pipeline or sequence can
       be executed without waiting for it to terminate by following it with an ‘&amp;’.

   <b>Builtin</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-builtin</b> <b>command</b> <b>execution</b>
       Builtin  commands  are  executed  within  the shell.  If any component of a pipeline except the last is a
       builtin command, the pipeline is executed in a subshell.

       Parenthesized commands are always executed in a subshell.

             (cd; pwd); pwd

       thus prints the <b>home</b> directory, leaving you where you were (printing  this  after  the  home  directory),
       while

             cd; pwd

       leaves  you  in  the  <b>home</b>  directory.   Parenthesized  commands  are  most often used to prevent <b>cd</b> from
       affecting the current shell.

       When a command to be executed is found not to be a builtin command the  shell  attempts  to  execute  the
       command via <u><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></u>(2).  Each word in the variable <b>path</b> names a directory in which the shell will look for
       the command.  If the shell is not given a <b>-f</b> option, the shell hashes the names in these directories into
       an  internal table so that it will try an <u><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a></u>(2) in only a directory where there is a possibility that
       the command resides there.  This greatly speeds command location when a large number of  directories  are
       present in the search path.  This hashing mechanism is not used:

             1.   If hashing is turned explicitly off via <b>unhash</b>.

             2.   If the shell was given a <b>-f</b> <u>argument</u>.

             3.   For each directory component of <b>path</b> which does not begin with a ‘/’.

             4.   If the command contains a ‘/’.

       In  the  above four cases the shell concatenates each component of the path vector with the given command
       name to form a path name of a file which it then attempts to execute it.  If execution is successful, the
       search stops.

       If the file has execute permissions but is not an executable to  the  system  (i.e.,  it  is  neither  an
       executable  binary  nor  a  script  that  specifies  its  interpreter),  then  it is assumed to be a file
       containing shell commands and a new shell is spawned to read it.  The <b>shell</b> special alias may be  set  to
       specify an interpreter other than the shell itself.

       On  systems  which  do not understand the ‘#!’ script interpreter convention the shell may be compiled to
       emulate it; see the <b>version</b> shell variable.  If so, the shell checks the first line of the file to see if
       it is of the form
             <b>#!</b><u>interpreter</u> <u>arg</u> <b>...</b>
       If it is, the shell starts <u>interpreter</u> with the given <u>arg</u>s and feeds the file to it on standard input.

   <b>Input/output</b>
       The standard input and standard output of a command may be redirected with the following syntax:

             <b>&lt;</b> <u>name</u>   Open file <u>name</u> (which is first variable, command and filename expanded)  as  the  standard
                      input.

             <b>&lt;&lt;</b> <u>word</u>  Read  the  shell  input up to a line which is identical to <u>word</u>.  <u>word</u> is not subjected to
                      variable, filename or command substitution, and each input line is compared to <u>word</u> before
                      any substitutions are done on this input line.  Unless a quoting ‘\’,  ‘"’,  ‘'’,  or  ‘`’
                      appears  in  <u>word</u> variable and command substitution is performed on the intervening lines,
                      allowing ‘\’ to quote ‘$’, ‘\’, and ‘`’.  Commands which are substituted have all  blanks,
                      tabs,  and  newlines  preserved,  except  for  the  final  newline  which is dropped.  The
                      resultant text is placed in an anonymous temporary file which is given to the  command  as
                      standard input.

             <b>&gt;</b> <u>name</u>
             <b>&gt;!</b> <u>name</u>
             <b>&gt;&amp;</b> <u>name</u>
             <b>&gt;&amp;!</b> <u>name</u>
                      The  file <u>name</u> is used as standard output.  If the file does not exist then it is created;
                      if the file exists, it is truncated, its previous contents being lost.

                      If the shell variable <b>noclobber</b> is set, then the file must not exist  or  be  a  character
                      special  file  (e.g.,  a  terminal  or <u>/dev/null</u>) or an error results.  This helps prevent
                      accidental destruction of files.  In this case the ‘!’ forms can be used to suppress  this
                      check.   If  ‘notempty’  is given in <b>noclobber</b>, ‘&gt;’ is allowed on empty files; if ‘ask’ is
                      given in <b>noclobber</b>, an interactive confirmation is presented, rather than an error.

                      The forms involving ‘&amp;’ route the diagnostic output into the specified file as well as the
                      standard output.  <u>name</u> is expanded in the same way as ‘&lt;’ input filenames are.

             <b>&gt;&gt;</b> <u>name</u>
             <b>&gt;&gt;&amp;</b> <u>name</u>
             <b>&gt;&gt;!</b> <u>name</u>
             <b>&gt;&gt;&amp;!</b> <u>name</u>
                      Like ‘&gt;’, but appends output to the end of <u>name</u>.  If the shell variable <b>noclobber</b> is  set,
                      then it is an error for the file <u>not</u> to exist, unless one of the ‘!’ forms is given.

       A  command  receives  the  environment  in  which  the  shell was invoked as modified by the input-output
       parameters and the presence of the command in a pipeline.  Thus, unlike some  previous  shells,  commands
       run  from  a  file  of  shell commands have no access to the text of the commands by default; rather they
       receive the original standard input of the shell.  The ‘&lt;&lt;’ mechanism should be used  to  present  inline
       data.   This permits shell command scripts to function as components of pipelines and allows the shell to
       block read its input.  Note that the default standard input for a command run detached is <u>not</u>  the  empty
       file  <u>/dev/null</u>,  but the original standard input of the shell.  If this is a terminal and if the process
       attempts to read from the terminal, then the process will block  and  the  user  will  be  notified  (see
       “Jobs”).

       Diagnostic  output  may  be  directed  through a pipe with the standard output.  Simply use the form ‘|&amp;’
       rather than just ‘|’.

       The shell cannot presently redirect diagnostic output without also redirecting standard output, but
             <b>(</b> <u>command</u> <b>&gt;</b> <u>output-file</u> ) <b>&gt;&amp;</b> <u>error-file</u>
       is often an acceptable workaround.  Either <u>output-file</u> or <u>error-file</u> may be <u>/dev/tty</u> to  send  output  to
       the terminal.

   <b>Features</b>
       Having  described  how  the shell accepts, parses and executes command lines, we now turn to a variety of
       its useful features.

   <b>Control</b> <b>flow</b>
       The shell contains a number of commands which can be used to regulate the  flow  of  control  in  command
       files  (shell  scripts) and (in limited but useful ways) from terminal input.  These commands all operate
       by forcing the shell to reread or skip in  its  input  and,  due  to  the  implementation,  restrict  the
       placement of some of the commands.

       The  <b>foreach</b>, <b>switch</b>, and <b>while</b> statements, as well as the <b>if</b> <b>...</b> <b>then</b> <b>...</b> <b>else</b> form of the <b>if</b> statement,
       require that the major keywords appear in a single simple command on an input line as shown below.

       If the shell's input is not seekable, the shell buffers up input  whenever  a  loop  is  being  read  and
       performs  seeks  in this internal buffer to accomplish the rereading implied by the loop.  (To the extent
       that this allows, backward <b>goto</b>s will succeed on non-seekable inputs.)

   <b>Expressions</b>
       The <b>if</b>, <b>while</b>, and <b>exit</b> builtin commands use expressions with  a  common  syntax.   The  expressions  can
       include  any  of the operators described in the next three sections.  Note that the <b>@</b> builtin command has
       its own separate syntax.

   <b>Logical,</b> <b>arithmetical</b> <b>and</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>operators</b>
       These operators are similar to those of C and have the same precedence.

       The operators, in descending precedence, with equivalent precedence per line, are:

             <b>(</b>     <b>)</b>
             <b>~</b>
             <b>!</b>
             <b>*</b>     <b>/</b>     <b>%</b>
             <b>+</b>     <b>-</b>
             <b>&lt;&lt;</b>    <b>&gt;&gt;</b>
             <b>&lt;=</b>    <b>&gt;=</b>    <b>&lt;</b>     <b>&gt;</b>
             <b>==</b>    <b>!=</b>    <b>=~</b>    <b>!~</b>
             <b>&amp;</b>
             <b>^</b>
             <b>|</b>
             <b>&amp;&amp;</b>
             <b>||</b>

       The ‘==’ ‘!=’ ‘=~’ and ‘!~’ operators compare their arguments as strings; all others operate on  numbers.
       The operators ‘=~’ and ‘!~’ are like ‘==’ and ‘!=’ except that the right hand side is a glob-pattern (see
       “Filename  substitution”)  against which the left hand operand is matched.  This reduces the need for use
       of the <b>switch</b> builtin command in shell scripts when all that is really needed is pattern matching.

       Null or missing arguments are considered  ‘0’.   The  results  of  all  expressions  are  strings,  which
       represent decimal numbers.  It is important to note that no two components of an expression can appear in
       the  same  word; except when adjacent to components of expressions which are syntactically significant to
       the parser (‘&amp;’, ‘|’, ‘&lt;’, ‘&gt;’, ‘(’, ‘)’) they should be surrounded by spaces.

   <b>Command</b> <b>exit</b> <b>status</b>
       Commands can be executed in expressions and their exit status returned by enclosing them in  braces  (‘{’
       and ‘}’).  Remember that the braces should be separated from the words of the command by spaces.  Command
       executions  succeed,  returning true, i.e., ‘1’, if the command exits with status 0, otherwise they fail,
       returning false, i.e., ‘0’.  If more detailed status information is required then the command  should  be
       executed outside of an expression and the <b>status</b> shell variable examined.

   <b>File</b> <b>inquiry</b> <b>operators</b>
       Some  of these operators perform true/false tests on files and related objects.  They are of the form <b>-</b><u>op</u>
       <u>file</u>, where <b>-</b><u>op</u> is one of:

             <b>-op</b>      <b>True/false</b> <b>file</b> <b>inquiry</b> <b>operator</b>

             <b>-r</b>       Read access.
             <b>-w</b>       Write access.
             <b>-x</b>       Execute access.
             <b>-X</b>       Executable in the path or shell builtin, e.g., ‘-X ls’ and ‘-X ls-F’ are  generally  true,
                      but ‘-X <a href="file:/bin/ls">/bin/ls</a>’ is not. (+)
             <b>-e</b>       Existence.
             <b>-o</b>       Ownership.
             <b>-z</b>       Zero size.
             <b>-s</b>       Non-zero size. (+)
             <b>-f</b>       Plain file.
             <b>-d</b>       Directory.
             <b>-l</b>       Symbolic link. (+) *
             <b>-b</b>       Block special file. (+)
             <b>-c</b>       Character special file. (+)
             <b>-p</b>       Named pipe (fifo). (+) *
             <b>-S</b>       Socket special file. (+) *
             <b>-u</b>       Set-user-ID bit is set. (+)
             <b>-g</b>       Set-group-ID bit is set. (+)
             <b>-k</b>       Sticky bit is set. (+)
             <b>-t</b>       <u>file</u> (which must be a digit) is an open file descriptor for a terminal device. (+)
             <b>-R</b>       Has been migrated (Convex only). (+)
             <b>-L</b>       Applies subsequent operators in a multiple-operator test to a symbolic link rather than to
                      the file to which the link points. (+) *

       <u>file</u>  is command and filename expanded and then tested to see if it has the specified relationship to the
       real user.  If <u>file</u> does not exist or is inaccessible or, for the operators  indicated  by  ‘*’,  if  the
       specified file type does not exist on the current system, then all inquiries return false, i.e., ‘0’.

       These operators may be combined for conciseness:
             <b>-</b><u>xy</u> <u>file</u>
       is equivalent to
             <b>-</b><u>x</u> <u>file</u> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>-</b><u>y</u> <u>file</u>
       (+) For example, ‘-fx’ is true (returns ‘1’) for plain executable files, but not for directories.

       <b>-L</b>  may  be used in a multiple-operator test to apply subsequent operators to a symbolic link rather than
       to the file to which the link points.  For example, <b>-lLo</b> is true for links owned by  the  invoking  user.
       <b>-Lr</b>,  <b>-Lw</b>, and <b>-Lx</b> are always true for links and false for non-links.  <b>-L</b> has a different meaning when it
       is the last operator in a multiple-operator test; see below.

       It is possible but not useful, and sometimes misleading, to combine operators which expect <u>file</u> to  be  a
       file  with  operators  which do not (e.g., <b>-X</b> and <b>-t</b>).  Following <b>-L</b> with a non-file operator can lead to
       particularly strange results.

       Other operators return other information, i.e., not just ‘0’ or ‘1’.  (+) They have the  same  format  as
       before; <b>-</b><u>op</u> may be one of:

             <b>-op</b>      <b>Extended</b> <b>file</b> <b>inquiry</b> <b>operator</b>

             <b>-A</b>       Last file access time, as the number of seconds since the epoch.
             <b>-A:</b>      Like ‘A’, but in timestamp format, e.g., ‘Fri May 14 16:36:10 1993’.
             <b>-M</b>       Last file modification time.
             <b>-M:</b>      Like <b>-M</b>, but in timestamp format.
             <b>-C</b>       Last inode modification time.
             <b>-C:</b>      Like <b>-C</b>, but in timestamp format.
             <b>-D</b>       Device number.
             <b>-I</b>       Inode number.
             <b>-F</b>       Composite <b>-f</b>ile identifier, in the form <u>device</u>:<u>inode</u>.
             <b>-L</b>       The name of the file pointed to by a symbolic link.
             <b>-N</b>       Number of (hard) links.
             <b>-P</b>       Permissions, in octal, without leading zero.
             <b>-P:</b>      Like <b>-P</b>, with leading zero.
             <b>-P</b><u>mode</u>   Equivalent to
                            <b>-P</b> <u>file</u> <b>&amp;</b> <u>mode</u>
                      For  example,  ‘-P22 <u>file</u>’ returns ‘22’ if <u>file</u> is writable by group and other, ‘20’ if by
                      group only, and ‘0’ if by neither.
             <b>-P</b><u>mode</u><b>:</b>  Like <b>-P</b><u>mode</u>, with leading zero.
             <b>-U</b>       Numeric userid.
             <b>-U:</b>      Username, or the numeric userid if the username is unknown.
             <b>-G</b>       Numeric groupid.
             <b>-G:</b>      Groupname, or the numeric groupid if the groupname is unknown.
             <b>-Z</b>       Size, in bytes.

       Only one of these operators may appear in a multiple-operator test, and it must be the last.   Note  that
       ‘L’  has  a  different meaning at the end of and elsewhere in a multiple-operator test.  Because ‘0’ is a
       valid return value for many of these operators, they do not return ‘0’ when they fail: most return  ‘-1’,
       and ‘F’ returns ‘:’.

       If  the  shell  is  compiled  with  POSIX  defined (see the <b>version</b> shell variable), the result of a file
       inquiry is based on the permission bits of the file and not on the result of the <u><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></u>(2)  system  call.
       For example, if one tests a file with <b>-w</b> whose permissions would ordinarily allow writing but which is on
       a file system mounted read-only, the test will succeed in a POSIX shell but fail in a non-POSIX shell.

       File inquiry operators can also be evaluated with the <b>filetest</b> builtin command (+).

   <b>Jobs</b>
       The  shell  associates  a  <u>job</u> with each pipeline.  It keeps a table of current jobs, printed by the <b>jobs</b>
       command, and assigns them small integer numbers.  When a job is  started  asynchronously  with  ‘&amp;’,  the
       shell prints a line which looks like

             [1] 1234

       indicating  that  the  job  which  was  started  asynchronously  was job number 1 and had one (top-level)
       process, whose process id was 1234.

       If you are running a job and wish to do something else you may hit the suspend key  (usually  <b>^Z</b>),  which
       sends a STOP signal to the current job.  The shell will then normally indicate that the job has been
             <b>Suspended</b>
       and  print  another prompt.  If the <b>listjobs</b> shell variable is set, all jobs will be listed like the <b>jobs</b>
       builtin command; if it is set to ‘long’ the listing will be in long format, like ‘jobs -l’.  You can then
       manipulate the state of the suspended job.  You can put it in the “background” with the <b>bg</b> command or run
       some other commands and eventually bring the job back into the  “foreground”  with  <b>fg</b>.   (See  also  the
       <b>run-fg-editor</b>  editor  command.)   A <b>^Z</b> takes effect immediately and is like an interrupt in that pending
       output and unread input are discarded when it is typed.  The <b>wait</b> builtin command  causes  the  shell  to
       wait for all background jobs to complete.

       The <b>^]</b> key sends a delayed suspend signal, which does not generate a STOP signal until a program attempts
       to <u><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></u>(2) it, to the current job.  This can usefully be typed ahead when you have prepared some commands
       for a job which you wish to stop after it has read them.  The <b>^Y</b> key performs this function in <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1); in
       <b>tcsh</b>, <b>^Y</b> is an editing command.  (+)

       A  job  being  run  in  the  background stops if it tries to read from the terminal.  Background jobs are
       normally allowed to produce output, but this can be disabled by giving the command
             <b>stty</b> <b>tostop</b>
       If you set this tty option, then background jobs will stop when they try to produce output like  they  do
       when they try to read input.

       There  are  several ways to refer to jobs in the shell.  The character ‘%’ introduces a job name.  If you
       wish to refer to job number 1, you can name it as
             <b>%1</b>
       Just naming a job brings it to the foreground; thus
             <b>%1</b>
       is a synonym for
             <b>fg</b> <b>%1</b>
       bringing job 1 back into the foreground.  Similarly, typing
             <b>%1</b> <b>&amp;</b>
       resumes job 1 in the background, just like
             <b>bg</b> <b>%1</b>
       A job can also be named by an unambiguous prefix of the string typed in to start it:
             <b>%ex</b>
       would normally restart a suspended <u><a href="../man1/ex.1.html">ex</a></u>(1) job, if there were only one suspended job whose name began  with
       the string ‘ex’.  It is also possible to type
             <b>%?</b><u>string</u>
       to specify a job whose text contains <u>string</u>, if there is only one such job.

       The shell maintains a notion of the current and previous jobs.  In output pertaining to jobs, the current
       job  is  marked with a ‘+’ and the previous job with a ‘-’.  The abbreviations ‘%+’, ‘%’, and (by analogy
       with the syntax of the <b>history</b> mechanism) ‘%%’ all refer to the current  job,  and  ‘%-’  refers  to  the
       previous job.

       The  job  control  mechanism  requires  that  the  <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1) option ‘new’ be set on some systems.  It is an
       artifact from a “new” implementation of the tty driver which allows generation  of  interrupt  characters
       from the keyboard to tell jobs to stop.  See <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1) and the <b>setty</b> builtin command for details on setting
       options in the new tty driver.

   <b>Status</b> <b>reporting</b>
       The  shell  learns  immediately whenever a process changes state.  It normally informs you whenever a job
       becomes blocked so that no further progress is possible, but only right before it prints a prompt.   This
       is done so that it does not otherwise disturb your work.  If, however, you set the shell variable <b>notify</b>,
       the  shell  will notify you immediately of changes of status in background jobs.  There is also a builtin
       command <b>notify</b> which marks a single process so that its status changes will be immediately reported.   By
       default <b>notify</b> marks the current process; simply enter
             <b>notify</b>
       after starting a background job to mark it for immediate status reporting.

       When you try to leave the shell while jobs are stopped, you will be warned that
             <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>jobs.</b>

       You  may use the <b>jobs</b> command to see what they are.  If you do this or immediately try to exit again, the
       shell will not warn you a second time, and the suspended jobs will be terminated.

   <b>Automatic,</b> <b>periodic</b> <b>and</b> <b>timed</b> <b>events</b> <b>(+)</b>
       There are various ways to run commands and take other actions automatically at various times in the “life
       cycle” of the shell.  They are summarized here, and described in detail under  the  appropriate  “Builtin
       commands”, “Special shell variables”, and “Special aliases (+)”.

       The <b>sched</b> builtin command puts commands in a scheduled-event list, to be executed by the shell at a given
       time.

       The  <b>beepcmd</b>,  <b>cwdcmd</b>,  <b>jobcmd</b>,  <b>periodic</b>,  <b>precmd</b>,  and  <b>postcmd</b>  “Special  aliases  (+)”  can  be  set,
       respectively, to execute commands: when the shell wants to ring the  bell,  when  the  working  directory
       changes,  when  a  job  is  started or is brought into the foreground, every <b>tperiod</b> minutes, before each
       prompt, and before each command gets executed.

       The <b>autologout</b> shell variable can be set to log out or lock the shell after a given number of minutes  of
       inactivity.

       The <b>mail</b> shell variable can be set to check for new mail periodically.

       The  <b>printexitvalue</b>  shell  variable  can  be  set to print the exit status of commands which exit with a
       status other than zero.

       The <b>rmstar</b> shell variable can be set to ask the user, when
             <b>rm</b> <b>*</b>
       is typed, if that is really what was meant.

       The <b>time</b> shell variable can be set to execute the <b>time</b>  builtin  command  after  the  completion  of  any
       process that takes more than a given number of CPU seconds.

       The  <b>watch</b>  and  <b>who</b>  shell variables can be set to report when selected users log in or out, and the <b>log</b>
       builtin command reports on those users at any time.

   <b>Native</b> <b>Language</b> <b>System</b> <b>support</b> <b>(+)</b>
       The shell is eight bit clean (if so compiled; see the <b>version</b> shell variable) and thus supports character
       sets needing this capability.  NLS support differs depending on whether or not the shell was compiled  to
       use  the  system's  NLS  (again, see <b>version</b>).  In either case, 7-bit ASCII is the default character code
       (e.g., the classification of which characters are printable)  and  sorting,  and  changing  the  LANG  or
       LC_CTYPE environment variables causes a check for possible changes in these respects.

       When  using  the  system's  NLS,  the  <u><a href="../man3/setlocale.3.html">setlocale</a></u>(3) function is called to determine appropriate character
       code/classification and sorting (e.g., ‘en_CA.UTF-8’ would yield ‘UTF-8’ as the  character  code).   This
       function   typically  examines  the  LANG  and  LC_CTYPE  environment  variables;  refer  to  the  system
       documentation for further details.  When not using the system's NLS, the shell simulates it  by  assuming
       that  the  ISO  8859-1  character set is used whenever either of the LANG and LC_CTYPE variables are set,
       regardless of their values.  Sorting is not affected for the simulated NLS.

       In addition, with both real and simulated NLS, all printable characters in  the  range  \200-\377,  i.e.,
       those  that  have  <b>M-</b><u>char</u>  bindings, are automatically rebound to <b>self-insert-command</b>.  The corresponding
       binding for the escape-<u>char</u> sequence, if any, is left alone.  These characters are  not  rebound  if  the
       NOREBIND  environment  variable is set.  This may be useful for the simulated NLS or a primitive real NLS
       which assumes full ISO 8859-1.  Otherwise, all <b>M-</b><u>char</u> bindings in the  range  \240-\377  are  effectively
       undone.  Explicitly rebinding the relevant keys with <b>bindkey</b> is of course still possible.

       Unknown  characters  (i.e.,  those  that are neither printable nor control characters) are printed in the
       format \nnn.  If the tty is not in 8 bit mode, other 8 bit characters are printed by converting  them  to
       ASCII  and  using  standout  mode.   The shell never changes the 7/8 bit mode of the tty and tracks user-
       initiated changes of 7/8 bit mode.  NLS users (or, for that matter, those who want to use a meta key) may
       need to explicitly set the tty in 8 bit mode through  the  appropriate  <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1)  command  in,  e.g.,  the
       <u><a href="file:~/.login">~/.login</a></u> file.

   <b>OS</b> <b>variant</b> <b>support</b> <b>(+)</b>
       A  number  of new builtin commands are provided to support features in particular operating systems.  All
       are described in detail in the “Builtin commands” section.

       On systems that support TCF (aix-ibm370, aix-ps2), <b>getspath</b> and <b>setspath</b> get and set the system execution
       path, <b>getxvers</b> and <b>setxvers</b> get and set the experimental version prefix and  <b>migrate</b>  migrates  processes
       between sites.  The <b>jobs</b> builtin prints the site on which each job is executing.

       Under BS2000, <b>bs2cmd</b> executes commands of the underlying BS2000/OSD operating system.

       Under  Domain/OS,  <b>inlib</b>  adds shared libraries to the current environment, <b>rootnode</b> changes the rootnode
       and <b>ver</b> changes the systype.

       Under Mach, <b>setpath</b> is equivalent to Mach's <u><a href="../man1/setpath.1.html">setpath</a></u>(1).

       Under Masscomp/RTU and Harris CX/UX, <b>universe</b> sets the universe.

       Under Harris CX/UX, <b>ucb</b> or <b>att</b> runs a command under the specified universe.

       Under Convex/OS, <b>warp</b> prints or sets the universe.

       The VENDOR, OSTYPE, and MACHTYPE environment variables indicate respectively the vendor, operating system
       and machine type (microprocessor class or machine model) of the system on which the shell  thinks  it  is
       running.   These  are  particularly  useful  when  sharing  one's home directory between several types of
       machines; one can, for example,

             set path = (<a href="file:~/bin.">~/bin.</a>$MACHTYPE /usr/ucb <a href="file:/bin">/bin</a> <a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a> .)

       in one's <u><a href="file:~/.login">~/.login</a></u> and put executables compiled for each machine in the appropriate directory.

       The <b>version</b> shell variable indicates what options were chosen when the shell was compiled.

       Note also the <b>newgrp</b> builtin, the  <b>afsuser</b>  and  <b>echo_style</b>  shell  variables  and  the  system-dependent
       locations of the shell's input files (see “FILES”).

   <b>Signal</b> <b>handling</b>
       Login  shells  ignore  interrupts when reading the file <u><a href="file:~/.logout">~/.logout</a></u>.  The shell ignores quit signals unless
       started with <b>-q</b>.  Login shells catch the terminate signal, but non-login  shells  inherit  the  terminate
       behavior from their parents.  Other signals have the values which the shell inherited from its parent.

       In  shell scripts, the shell's handling of interrupt and terminate signals can be controlled with <b>onintr</b>,
       and its handling of hangups can be controlled with <b>hup</b> and <b>nohup</b>.

       The shell exits on a hangup (see also the <b>logout</b> shell variable).  By default, the  shell's  children  do
       too,  but  the  shell  does  not  send them a hangup when it exits.  <b>hup</b> arranges for the shell to send a
       hangup to a child when it exits, and <b>nohup</b> sets a child to ignore hangups.

   <b>Terminal</b> <b>management</b> <b>(+)</b>
       The shell uses three different sets of terminal (“tty”) modes: ‘edit’, used when editing;  ‘quote’,  used
       when  quoting  literal  characters;  and  ‘execute’,  used when executing commands.  The shell holds some
       settings in each mode constant, so commands which leave the tty in a confused state do not interfere with
       the shell.  The shell also matches changes in the speed and padding of the tty.  The list  of  tty  modes
       that  are  kept  constant  can  be  examined and modified with the <b>setty</b> builtin.  Note that although the
       editor uses CBREAK mode (or its equivalent), it takes typed-ahead characters anyway.

       The <b>echotc</b>, <b>settc</b>, and <b>telltc</b> commands can be used to manipulate and debug terminal capabilities from the
       command line.

       On systems that support SIGWINCH or SIGWINDOW, the shell adapts  to  window  resizing  automatically  and
       adjusts the environment variables LINES and COLUMNS if set.  If the environment variable TERMCAP contains
       ‘li#’ and ‘co#’ fields, the shell adjusts them to reflect the new window size.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCE</b></h4><pre>
       The next sections of this manual describe all of the available “Builtin commands”, “Special aliases (+)”,
       and “Special shell variables”.

   <b>Builtin</b> <b>commands</b>
       <b>%</b><u>job</u>    A synonym for the <b>fg</b> builtin command.

       <b>%</b><u>job</u> <b>&amp;</b>  A synonym for the <b>bg</b> builtin command.

       <b>:</b>       Does nothing, successfully.

       <b>@</b>
       <b>@</b> <u>name</u> <b>=</b> <u>expr</u>
       <b>@</b> <u>name</u><b>[</b><u>index</u><b>]</b> <b>=</b> <u>expr</u>
       <b>@</b> <u>name</u><b>++|--</b>
       <b>@</b> <u>name</u><b>[</b><u>index</u><b>]++|--</b>
               The first form prints the values of all shell variables.

               The second form assigns the value of <u>expr</u> to <u>name</u>.

               The  third  form  assigns  the value of <u>expr</u> to the <u>index</u>'th component of <u>name</u>; both <u>name</u> and its
               <u>index</u>'th component must already exist.

               <u>expr</u> may contain the operators ‘*’, ‘+’, etc., as in C.  If <u>expr</u> contains ‘&lt;’, ‘&gt;’, ‘&amp;’,  or  ‘|’
               then  at least that part of <u>expr</u> must be placed within (‘’ and ‘’).  Note that the syntax of <u>expr</u>
               has nothing to do with that described under “Expressions”.

               The fourth and fifth forms increment (‘<b>++</b>’) or decrement (‘<b>--</b>’) <u>name</u> or its <u>index</u>'th component.

               The space between ‘<b>@</b>’ and <u>name</u> is required.  The spaces between <u>name</u> and ‘<b>=</b>’ and between ‘<b>=</b>’  and
               <u>expr</u> are optional.  Components of <u>expr</u> must be separated by spaces.

       <b>alias</b> [<u>name</u> [<u>wordlist</u>]]
               Without arguments, prints all aliases.

               With <u>name</u>, prints the alias for name.

               With  <u>name</u> and <u>wordlist</u>, assigns <u>wordlist</u> as the alias of <u>name</u>.  <u>wordlist</u> is command and filename
               substituted.

               <u>name</u> may not be ‘<b>alias</b>’ or ‘<b>unalias</b>’.  See also the <b>unalias</b> builtin command.

       <b>alloc</b>   Shows the amount of dynamic memory acquired, broken down into used  and  free  memory.   With  an
               argument shows the number of free and used blocks in each size category.  The categories start at
               size  8  and  double  at  each step.  This command's output may vary across system types, because
               systems other than the VAX may use a different memory allocator.

       <b>bg</b> [<b>%</b><u>job</u> ...]
               Puts the specified jobs (or, without arguments, the current job) into the background,  continuing
               each  if  it  is stopped.  <u>job</u> may be a number, a string, ‘’, ‘%’, ‘+’, or ‘-’ as described under
               “Jobs”.

       <b>bindkey</b> [<b>-l</b>|<b>-d</b>|<b>-e</b>|<b>-v</b>|<b>-u</b>] (+)
       <b>bindkey</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-b</b>] [<b>-k</b>] [<b>-r</b>] [<b>--</b>] <u>key</u> (+)
       <b>bindkey</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-b</b>] [<b>-k</b>] [<b>-c</b>|<b>-s</b>] [<b>--</b>] <u>key</u> <u>command</u> (+)
               The first form either lists all bound keys and the editor command to which each is bound, lists a
               description of the commands, or binds all keys to a specific mode.

               The second form lists the editor command to which <u>key</u> is bound.

               The third form binds the editor command <u>command</u> to <u>key</u>.

               Supported <b>bindkey</b> options:

               <b>Option</b>  <b>bindkey</b> <b>description</b>

               <b>-a</b>      Lists or changes key-bindings in the alternative key map.  This is the key  map  used  in
                       <b>vimode</b> command mode.

               <b>-b</b>      <u>key</u>  is  interpreted  as a control character written <b>^</b><u>character</u> (e.g., <b>^A</b>) or <b>C-</b><u>character</u>
                       (e.g., <b>C-A</b>), a meta character written <b>M-</b><u>character</u> (e.g., <b>M-A</b>),  a  function  key  written
                       <b>F-</b><u>string</u> (e.g., <b>F-string</b>), or an extended prefix key written <b>X-</b><u>character</u> (e.g., <b>X-A</b>).

               <b>-c</b>      <u>command</u> is interpreted as a builtin or external command instead of an editor command.

               <b>-d</b>      Binds all keys to the standard bindings for the default editor, as per <b>-e</b> and <b>-v</b>.

               <b>-e</b>      Binds all keys to <u><a href="../man1/emacs.1.html">emacs</a></u>(1)-style bindings.  Unsets <b>vimode</b>.

               <b>-k</b>      <u>key</u>  is  interpreted  as  a  symbolic  arrow  key name, which may be one of ‘down’, ‘up’,
                       ‘left’, or ‘right’.

               <b>-l</b>      Lists all editor commands and a short description of each.

               <b>-r</b>      Removes  <u>key</u>'s  binding.    Be   careful:   ‘bindkey   -r’   does   <u>not</u>   bind   <u>key</u>   to
                       <b>self-insert-command</b>, it unbinds <u>key</u> completely.

               <b>-s</b>      <u>command</u>  is  taken  as  a literal string and treated as terminal input when <u>key</u> is typed.
                       Bound keys in <u>command</u> are themselves reinterpreted, and this continues for ten levels  of
                       interpretation.

               <b>-u</b> (or any invalid option)
                       Prints a usage message.

               <b>-v</b>      Binds all keys to <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1)-style bindings.  Sets <b>vimode</b>.

               <b>--</b>      Forces a break from option processing, so the next word is taken as <u>key</u> even if it begins
                       with ‘-’.

               <u>key</u>  may  be  a  single  character  or  a  string.   If a command is bound to a string, the first
               character of the string is bound to <b>sequence-lead-in</b> and  the  entire  string  is  bound  to  the
               command.

               Control  characters  in  <u>key</u>  can be literal (they can be typed by preceding them with the editor
               command <b>quoted-insert</b>, normally bound to <b>^V</b>) or written caret-character style, e.g., <b>^A</b>.   Delete
               is  written  <b>^?</b>  (caret-question mark).  <u>key</u> and <u>command</u> can contain backslashed escape sequences
               (in the style of System V <u><a href="../man1/echo.1.html">echo</a></u>(1)) as follows:

               <b>Escape</b>  <b>Description</b>

               <b>\a</b>      Bell.

               <b>\b</b>      Backspace.

               <b>\e</b>      Escape.

               <b>\f</b>      Form feed.

               <b>\n</b>      Newline.

               <b>\r</b>      Carriage return.

               <b>\t</b>      Horizontal tab.

               <b>\v</b>      Vertical tab.

               <b>\</b><u>nnn</u>    The ASCII character corresponding to the octal number <u>nnn</u>.

               ‘\’ nullifies the special meaning of the following character, if it has any, notably ‘\’ and ‘^’.

       <b>bs2cmd</b> <u>bs2000-command</u> (+)
               Passes <u>bs2000-command</u> to the BS2000 command  interpreter  for  execution.   Only  non-interactive
               commands  can  be  executed, and it is not possible to execute any command that would overlay the
               image of the current process, like /EXECUTE or /CALL-PROCEDURE. (BS2000 only)

       <b>break</b>   Causes execution to resume after the  <b>end</b>  of  the  nearest  enclosing  <b>foreach</b>  or  <b>while</b>.   The
               remaining  commands  on  the  current line are executed.  Multi-level breaks are thus possible by
               writing them all on one line.

       <b>breaksw</b>
               Causes a break from a <b>switch</b>, resuming after the <b>endsw</b>.

       <b>builtins</b> (+)
               Prints the names of all builtin commands.

       <b>bye</b> (+)
               A synonym for the <b>logout</b> builtin command.  Available only if the shell was so compiled;  see  the
               <b>version</b> shell variable.

       <b>case</b> <u>label</u><b>:</b>
               A label in a <b>switch</b> statement as discussed below.

       <b>cd</b> [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-l</b>] [<b>-n</b>|<b>-v</b>] [<b>--</b>] [<u>name</u>]
               If  a directory <u>name</u> is given, changes the shell's working directory to <u>name</u>.  If not, changes to
               <b>home</b>, unless the <b>cdtohome</b> variable is not set, in which case a <u>name</u> is required.  If <u>name</u> is  ‘-’
               it is interpreted as the previous working directory (see “Other substitutions (+)”).  (+) If <u>name</u>
               is not a subdirectory of the current directory (and does not begin with ‘/’, ‘./’ or ‘../’), each
               component  of  the  variable <b>cdpath</b> is checked to see if it has a subdirectory <u>name</u>.  Finally, if
               all else fails but <u>name</u> is a shell variable whose value begins with ‘/’  or  ‘.’,  then  this  is
               tried to see if it is a directory, and the <b>-p</b> option is implied.

               With  <b>-p</b>,  prints  the  final directory stack, just like <b>dirs</b>.  The <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b>, and <b>-v</b> flags have the
               same effect on <b>cd</b> as on <b>dirs</b>, and they imply <b>-p</b>  (+).   Using  <b>--</b>  forces  a  break  from  option
               processing so the next word is taken as the directory <u>name</u> even if it begins with ‘-’ (+).

               See also the <b>implicitcd</b> and <b>cdtohome</b> shell variables.

       <b>chdir</b>   A synonym for the <b>cd</b> builtin command.

       <b>complete</b> [<u>command</u> [<u>word</u><b>/</b><u>pattern</u><b>/</b><u>list</u>[<b>:</b><u>select</u>]<b>/</b>[[<u>suffix</u>]<b>/</b>] ...]]  (+)
               Without arguments, lists all completions.

               With <u>command</u>, lists completions for <u>command</u>.

               With <u>command</u> and <u>word</u> ..., defines completions.

               <u>command</u> may be a full command name or a glob-pattern (see “Filename substitution”).  It can begin
               with ‘-’ to indicate that completion should be used only when <b>command</b> is ambiguous.

               <u>word</u>  specifies which word relative to the current word is to be completed, and may be one of the
               following:

                     <u>word</u>   <b>Completion</b> <b>word</b>

                     <b>c</b>      Current-word completion.  <u>pattern</u> is a glob-pattern which must match  the  beginning
                            of  the  current  word  on the command line.  <u>pattern</u> is ignored when completing the
                            current word.

                     <b>C</b>      Like ‘c’, but includes <u>pattern</u> when completing the current word.

                     <b>n</b>      Next-word completion.  <u>pattern</u> is a glob-pattern which must match the  beginning  of
                            the previous word on the command line.

                     <b>N</b>      Like ‘n’, but must match the beginning of the word two before the current word.

                     <b>p</b>      Position-dependent  completion.   <u>pattern</u>  is  a numeric range, with the same syntax
                            used to index shell variables, which must include the current word.

               <u>list</u>, the list of possible completions, may be one of the following:

                     <u>list</u>   <b>Completion</b> <b>item</b>

                     <b>a</b>      Aliases.

                     <b>b</b>      Bindings (editor commands).

                     <b>c</b>      Commands (builtin or external commands).

                     <b>C</b>      External commands which begin with the supplied path prefix.

                     <b>d</b>      Directories.

                     <b>D</b>      Directories which begin with the supplied path prefix.

                     <b>e</b>      Environment variables.

                     <b>f</b>      Filenames.

                     <b>F</b>      Filenames which begin with the supplied path prefix.

                     <b>g</b>      Groupnames.

                     <b>j</b>      Jobs.

                     <b>l</b>      Limits.

                     <b>n</b>      Nothing.

                     <b>s</b>      Shell variables.

                     <b>S</b>      Signals.

                     <b>t</b>      Plain (“text”) files.

                     <b>T</b>      Plain (“text”) files which begin with the supplied path prefix.

                     <b>v</b>      Any variables.

                     <b>u</b>      Usernames.

                     <b>x</b>      Like ‘n’, but prints <u>select</u> when <b>list-choices</b> is used.

                     <b>X</b>      Completions.

                     <b>$</b><u>var</u>   Words from the variable <u>var</u>.

                     <b>(...)</b>  Words from the given list.

                     <b>`...`</b>  Words from the output of command.

               <u>select</u> is an optional glob-pattern.  If given,  words  from  only  <u>list</u>  that  match  <u>select</u>  are
               considered  and  the  <b>fignore</b>  shell  variable  is  ignored.  The <u>list</u> types ‘$<u>var</u>’, ‘(...)’, and
               ‘`...`’ may not have a <u>select</u> pattern, and ‘x’ uses <u>select</u> as an  explanatory  message  when  the
               <b>list-choices</b> editor command is used.

               <u>suffix</u> is a single character to be appended to a successful completion.  If null, no character is
               appended.   If  omitted  (in  which  case  the  fourth delimiter can also be omitted), a slash is
               appended to directories and a space to other words.

               <u>command</u> invoked from <u>list</u> ‘`...`’ has the additional environment variable COMMAND_LINE set, which
               contains (as its name indicates) contents of the current (already typed in)  command  line.   One
               can examine and use contents of the COMMAND_LINE environment variable in a custom script to build
               more sophisticated completions (see completion for <u><a href="../man1/svn.1.html">svn</a></u>(1) included in this package).

               Now  for  some  examples.   Some commands take only directories as arguments, so there's no point
               completing plain files.

                     &gt; complete cd 'p/1/d/'

               completes only the first word following ‘cd’ (‘p/1’) with a directory.  ‘p’-type  completion  can
               also be used to narrow down command completion:

                     &gt; co[^D]
                     complete compress
                     &gt; complete -co* 'p/0/(compress)/'
                     &gt; co[^D]
                     &gt; compress

               This  completion  completes  commands  (words  in  position 0, ‘p/0’) which begin with ‘co’ (thus
               matching ‘co*’) to ‘compress’ (the only word in the list).  The leading ‘-’ indicates  that  this
               completion is to be used with only ambiguous commands.

                     &gt; complete find 'n/-user/u/'

               is  an  example  of  ‘n’-type  completion.   Any  word following ‘find’ and immediately following
               ‘-user’ is completed from the list of users.

                     &gt; complete cc 'c/-I/d/'

               demonstrates ‘c’-type completion.  Any word following ‘cc’ and beginning with ‘-I’  is  completed
               as a directory.  ‘-I’ is not taken as part of the directory because we used lowercase ‘c’.

               Different <u>list</u>s are useful with different commands.

                     &gt; complete alias 'p/1/a/'
                     &gt; complete man 'p/*/c/'
                     &gt; complete set 'p/1/s/'
                     &gt; complete true 'p/1/x:Truth has no options./'

               These  complete  words  following ‘alias’ with aliases, ‘man’ with commands, and ‘set’ with shell
               variables.  <b>true</b> doesn't have any options, so ‘x’ does nothing when completion is  attempted  and
               prints
                     <b>Truth</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>options.</b>
               when completion choices are listed.

               Note  that  the  ‘man’  example,  and  several other examples below, could just as well have used
               ‘'c/*'’ or ‘'n/*'’ as ‘'p/*'’.

               Words can be completed from a variable evaluated at completion time,

                     &gt; complete ftp 'p/1/$hostnames/'
                     &gt; set hostnames = (rtfm.mit.edu tesla.ee.cornell.edu)
                     &gt; ftp [^D]
                     rtfm.mit.edu tesla.ee.cornell.edu
                     &gt; ftp [^C]
                     &gt; set hostnames = (rtfm.mit.edu tesla.ee.cornell.edu uunet.uu.net)
                     &gt; ftp [^D]
                     rtfm.mit.edu tesla.ee.cornell.edu uunet.uu.net

               or from a command run at completion time:

                     &gt; complete kill 'p/*/`ps | awk \{print\ \$1\}`/'
                     &gt; kill -9 [^D]
                     23113 23377 23380 23406 23429 23529 23530 PID

               Note that the <b>complete</b> command does not itself quote its arguments, so the braces, space and  ‘$’
               in ‘{print $1}’ must be quoted explicitly.

               One command can have multiple completions:

                     &gt; complete dbx 'p/2/(core)/' 'p/*/c/'

               completes  the  second  argument  to  ‘dbx’  with  the  word  ‘core’ and all other arguments with
               commands.  Note that the positional completion is  specified  before  the  next-word  completion.
               Because  completions are evaluated from left to right, if the next-word completion were specified
               first it would always match and the positional completion would never be  executed.   This  is  a
               common mistake when defining a completion.

               The  <u>select</u> pattern is useful when a command takes files with only particular forms as arguments.
               For example,

                     &gt; complete cc 'p/*/f:*.[cao]/'

               completes ‘cc’ arguments to files ending in only ‘.c’, ‘.a’, or ‘.o’.  <u>select</u>  can  also  exclude
               files,  using  negation  of a glob-pattern as described under “Filename substitution”.  One might
               use

                     &gt; complete rm 'p/*/f:^*.{c,h,cc,C,tex,1,man,l,y}/'

               to exclude precious source code from ‘rm’ completion.  Of course, one could still  type  excluded
               names   manually   or   override   the   completion  mechanism  using  the  <b>complete-word-raw</b>  or
               <b>list-choices-raw</b> editor commands.

               The ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘F’, and ‘T’ <u>list</u>s are like ‘c’, ‘d’, ‘f’, and ‘t’ respectively, but they  use  the
               <u>select</u>  argument  in a different way: to restrict completion to files beginning with a particular
               path prefix.  For example, the Elm mail program uses  ‘=’  as  an  abbreviation  for  one's  mail
               directory.  One might use

                     &gt; complete elm c@=@F:$HOME/Mail/@

               to complete
                     <b>elm</b> <b>-f</b> <b>=</b>
               as if it were
                     <b>elm</b> <b>-f</b> <b><a href="file:~/Mail/">~/Mail/</a></b>
               Note  that  we used the separator ‘@’ instead of ‘/’ to avoid confusion with the <u>select</u> argument,
               and we used ‘$HOME’ instead of  ‘~’  because  home  directory  substitution  works  at  only  the
               beginning of a word.

               <u>suffix</u> is used to add a nonstandard suffix (not space or ‘/’ for directories) to completed words.

                     &gt; complete finger 'c/*@/$hostnames/' 'p/1/u/@'

               completes  arguments to ‘finger’ from the list of users, appends an ‘@’, and then completes after
               the ‘@’ from the ‘hostnames’ variable.  Note  again  the  order  in  which  the  completions  are
               specified.

               Finally, here's a complex example for inspiration:

                     &gt; complete find \
                     'n/-name/f/' 'n/-newer/f/' 'n/-{,n}cpio/f/' \
                     'n/-exec/c/' 'n/-ok/c/' 'n/-user/u/' \
                     'n/-group/g/' 'n/-fstype/(nfs 4.2)/' \
                     'n/-type/(b c d f l p s)/' \
                     'c/-/(name newer cpio ncpio exec ok user \
                     group fstype type atime ctime depth inum \
                     ls mtime nogroup nouser perm print prune \
                     size xdev)/' \
                     'p/*/d/'

               This  completes  words  following ‘-name’, ‘-newer’, ‘-cpio’, or ‘-ncpio’ (note the pattern which
               matches both) to files, words following ‘-exec’ or ‘-ok’ to commands, words following ‘-user’ and
               ‘-group’ to users and groups respectively and words following ‘-fstype’ or ‘-type’ to members  of
               the  given lists.  It also completes the switches themselves from the given list (note the use of
               ‘c’-type completion) and completes anything not otherwise completed to a directory.  Whew.

               Remember that programmed completions  are  ignored  if  the  word  being  completed  is  a  tilde
               substitution  (beginning  with  ‘~’) or a variable (beginning with ‘$’).  See also the <b>uncomplete</b>
               builtin command.

       <b>continue</b>
               Continues execution of the nearest enclosing <b>while</b> or <b>foreach</b>.  The rest of the commands  on  the
               current line are executed.

       <b>default:</b>
               Labels the default case in a <b>switch</b> statement.  It should come after all <b>case</b> labels.

       <b>dirs</b> [<b>-l</b>] [<b>-n</b>|<b>-v</b>]
       <b>dirs</b> <b>-S</b>|<b>-L</b> [<u>filename</u>] (+)
       <b>dirs</b> <b>-c</b> (+)
               The  first  form  prints  the directory stack.  The top of the stack is at the left and the first
               directory in the stack is the current directory.  With <b>-l</b>,  ‘~’  or  ‘~<u>name</u>’  in  the  output  is
               expanded  explicitly  to  <b>home</b> or the pathname of the home directory for user <u>name</u>.  (+) With <b>-n</b>,
               entries are wrapped before they reach the edge of the screen.  (+) With <b>-v</b>, entries  are  printed
               one  per  line, preceded by their stack positions.  (+) If more than one of <b>-n</b> or <b>-v</b> is given, <b>-v</b>
               takes precedence.  <b>-p</b> is accepted but does nothing.

               The second form with <b>-S</b> saves the directory stack to  <u>filename</u>  as  a  series  of  <b>cd</b>  and  <b>pushd</b>
               commands.   The  second form with <b>-L</b> sources <u>filename</u>, which is presumably a directory stack file
               saved by the <b>-S</b> option or the <b>savedirs</b> mechanism.  In either case, <b>dirsfile</b> is used  if  <u>filename</u>
               is not given and <u><a href="file:~/.cshdirs">~/.cshdirs</a></u> is used if <b>dirsfile</b> is unset.

               Note that login shells do the equivalent of
                     <b>dirs</b> <b>-L</b>
               on startup and, if <b>savedirs</b> is set,
                     <b>dirs</b> <b>-S</b>
               before exiting.  Because only <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u> is normally sourced before <u><a href="file:~/.cshdirs">~/.cshdirs</a></u>, <b>dirsfile</b> should be
               set in <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u> rather than <u><a href="file:~/.login">~/.login</a></u>.

               The third form clears the directory stack.

       <b>echo</b> [<b>-n</b>] <u>word</u> ...
               Writes  each  <u>word</u>  to  the  shell's  standard  output, separated by spaces and terminated with a
               newline.  The <b>echo_style</b> shell variable may be set to emulate  (or  not)  the  flags  and  escape
               sequences of the BSD and/or System V versions of <u><a href="../man1/echo.1.html">echo</a></u>(1); see “Escape sequences (+)” and <u><a href="../man1/echo.1.html">echo</a></u>(1).

       <b>echotc</b> [<b>-sv</b>] <u>arg</u> ... (+)
               Exercises the terminal capabilities (see <u><a href="../man5/termcap.5.html">termcap</a></u>(5)) in <u>arg</u>.  For example,
                     <b>echotc</b> <b>home</b>
               sends the cursor to the home position,
                     <b>echotc</b> <b>cm</b> <b>3</b> <b>10</b>
               sends it to column 3 and row 10, and
                     <b>echotc</b> <b>ts</b> <b>0;</b> <b>echo</b> <b>"This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>test.";</b> <b>echotc</b> <b>fs</b>
               prints
                     <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>test.</b>
               in the status line.

               If  <u>arg</u> is ‘baud’, ‘cols’, ‘lines’, ‘meta’, or ‘tabs’, prints the value of that capability (“yes”
               or “no” indicating that the terminal does or does not have that capability).  One might use  this
               to make the output from a shell script less verbose on slow terminals, or limit command output to
               the number of lines on the screen:

                     &gt; set history=`echotc lines`

                     &gt; @ history--
               Termcap  strings  may  contain  wildcards  which  will not echo correctly.  One should use double
               quotes when setting a shell variable to a terminal capability string, as in the following example
               that places the date in the status line:

                     &gt; set tosl="`echotc ts 0`"
                     &gt; set frsl="`echotc fs`"
                     &gt; echo -n "$tosl";date; echo -n "$frsl"

               With <b>-s</b>, nonexistent capabilities return the empty string rather than causing an error.  With <b>-v</b>,
               messages are verbose.

       <b>else</b>
       <b>end</b>
       <b>endif</b>
       <b>endsw</b>   See the description of the <b>foreach</b>, <b>if</b>, <b>switch</b>, and <b>while</b> statements below.

       <b>eval</b> <u>arg</u> ...
               Treats the arguments as input to the shell and executes the resulting command(s) in  the  context
               of  the  current  shell.   This  is  usually  used to execute commands generated as the result of
               command or variable substitution, because parsing occurs before these substitutions.  See <u><a href="../man1/tset.1.html">tset</a></u>(1)
               for a sample use of <b>eval</b>.

       <b>exec</b> <u>command</u> ...
               Executes the specified <u>command</u> in place of the current shell.

       <b>exit</b> [<u>expr</u>]
               The shell exits either with the value of the specified <u>expr</u> (an expression,  as  described  under
               “Expressions”) or, without <u>expr</u>, with the value 0.

       <b>fg</b> [<b>%</b><u>job</u> ...]
               Brings  the  specified  jobs  (or,  without  arguments,  the  current  job)  into the foreground,
               continuing each if it is stopped.  <u>job</u> may be a number,  a  string,  ‘’,  ‘%’,  ‘+’,  or  ‘-’  as
               described under “Jobs”.  See also the <b>run-fg-editor</b> editor command.

       <b>filetest</b> <b>-</b><u>op</u> <u>file</u> ... (+)
               Applies <u>op</u> (which is a file inquiry operator as described under “File inquiry operators”) to each
               <u>file</u> and returns the results as a space-separated list.

       <b>foreach</b> <u>name</u> <b>(</b><u>wordlist</u><b>)</b>
       <b>...</b>
       <b>end</b>     Successively  sets  the  variable  <u>name</u>  to  each member of <u>wordlist</u> and executes the sequence of
               commands between this command and the matching <b>end</b>.  (Both <b>foreach</b> and <b>end</b> must appear  alone  on
               separate  lines.)   The builtin command <b>continue</b> may be used to continue the loop prematurely and
               the builtin command <b>break</b> to terminate it prematurely.   When  this  command  is  read  from  the
               terminal, the loop is read once prompting with
                     <b>foreach?</b>
               (or  <b>prompt2</b>)  before any statements in the loop are executed.  If you make a mistake typing in a
               loop at the terminal you can rub it out.

       <b>getspath</b> (+)
               Prints the system execution path.  (TCF only)

       <b>getxvers</b> (+)
               Prints the experimental version prefix.  (TCF only)

       <b>glob</b> <u>word</u> ...
               Like <b>echo</b>, but the <b>-n</b> parameter is not recognized and words are delimited by null  characters  in
               the output.  Useful for programs which wish to use the shell to filename expand a list of words.

       <b>goto</b> <u>word</u>
               <u>word</u>  is  filename  and  command-substituted  to  yield  a string of the form ‘<u>label</u>’.  The shell
               rewinds its input as much as possible, searches for a line of the form
                     <u>label</u>:
               possibly preceded by blanks or tabs, and continues execution after that line.

       <b>hashstat</b>
               Prints a statistics line indicating how effective the internal hash table has  been  at  locating
               commands  (and  avoiding  <b>exec</b>'s).  An <b>exec</b> is attempted for each component of the <b>path</b> where the
               hash function indicates a possible hit, and in each component which does not begin with a ‘/’.

               On machines without <u><a href="../man2/vfork.2.html">vfork</a></u>(2), prints only the number and size of hash buckets.

       <b>history</b> [<b>-hTr</b>] [<u>n</u>]
       <b>history</b> <b>-S</b>|<b>-L</b>|<b>-M</b> [<u>filename</u>] (+)
       <b>history</b> <b>-c</b> (+)
               The first form prints the history event list.  If <u>n</u> is given only the <u>n</u> most  recent  events  are
               printed  or  saved.   With  <b>-h</b>,  the  history  list is printed without leading numbers.  If <b>-T</b> is
               specified, timestamps are printed also in comment form.   This  can  be  used  to  produce  files
               suitable for loading with
                     <b>history</b> <b>-L</b>
               or
                     <b>source</b> <b>-h</b>

               With <b>-r</b>, the order of printing is most recent first rather than oldest first.

               The  second  form  with <b>-S</b> saves the history list to <u>filename</u>.  If the first word of the <b>savehist</b>
               shell variable is set to a number, at most that many lines are saved.   If  the  second  word  of
               <b>savehist</b>  is set to ‘merge’, the history list is merged with the existing history file instead of
               replacing it (if there is one) and sorted  by  time  stamp.   (+)  Merging  is  intended  for  an
               environment like the X Window System with several shells in simultaneous use.  If the second word
               of  <b>savehist</b>  is  ‘merge’  and  the  third word is set to ‘lock’, the history file update will be
               serialized with other shell sessions that would possibly like to merge  history  at  exactly  the
               same time.

               The  second  form  with  <b>-L</b>  appends <u>filename</u> (which is presumably a history list saved by the <b>-S</b>
               option or the <b>savehist</b> mechanism) to the history list.  <b>-M</b>  is  like  <b>-L</b>,  but  the  contents  of
               <u>filename</u>  are  merged into the history list and sorted by timestamp.  In either case, <b>histfile</b> is
               used if <u>filename</u> is not given and <u><a href="file:~/.history">~/.history</a></u> is used if <b>histfile</b> is unset.

               Note that
                     <b>history</b> <b>-L</b>
               is exactly like
                     <b>source</b> <b>-h</b>
               except that it does not require a filename.

               Note that login shells do the equivalent of
                     <b>history</b> <b>-L</b>
               on startup and, if <b>savehist</b> is set,
                     <b>history</b> <b>-S</b>
               before exiting.  Because only <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u> is normally sourced before <u><a href="file:~/.history">~/.history</a></u>, <b>histfile</b> should be
               set in <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u> rather than <u><a href="file:~/.login">~/.login</a></u>.

               If <b>histlit</b> is set, the first and second forms print and save the literal (unexpanded) form of the
               history list.

               The third form clears the history list.

       <b>hup</b> [<u>command</u>] (+)
               With <u>command</u>, runs <u>command</u> such that it will exit on a hangup signal and arranges for  the  shell
               to  send  it a hangup signal when the shell exits.  Note that commands may set their own response
               to hangups, overriding <b>hup</b>.  Without an argument, causes the non-interactive shell only  to  exit
               on  a  hangup  for the remainder of the script.  See also “Signal handling” and the <b>nohup</b> builtin
               command.

       <b>if</b> <b>(</b><u>expr</u><b>)</b> <u>command</u>
               If <u>expr</u> (an expression, as  described  under  “Expressions”)  evaluates  true,  then  <u>command</u>  is
               executed.   Variable substitution on <u>command</u> happens early, at the same time it does for the rest
               of the <b>if</b> command.  <u>command</u> must be a simple command, not an alias, a pipeline, a command list or
               a parenthesized command list, but it may have arguments.  Input/output redirection occurs even if
               <u>expr</u> is false and <u>command</u> is thus <u>not</u> executed; this is a bug.

       <b>if</b> <b>(</b><u>expr</u><b>)</b> <b>then</b>
       <b>...</b>
       <b>else</b> <b>if</b> <b>(</b><u>expr2</u><b>)</b> <b>then</b>
       <b>...</b>
       <b>else</b>
       <b>...</b>
       <b>endif</b>   If the specified <u>expr</u> is true then the commands to the first  <b>else</b>  are  executed;  otherwise  if
               <u>expr2</u>  is  true  then  the  commands to the second <b>else</b> are executed, etc.  Any number of <b>else</b> <b>if</b>
               pairs are possible; only one <b>endif</b> is needed.  The <b>else</b> part is likewise  optional.   (The  words
               <b>else</b> and <b>endif</b> must appear at the beginning of input lines; the <b>if</b> must appear alone on its input
               line or after an <b>else</b>.)

       <b>inlib</b> <u>shared-library</u> ... (+)
               Adds each <u>shared-library</u> to the current environment.  There is no way to remove a shared library.
               (Domain/OS only)

       <b>jobs</b> [<b>-l</b>]
       <b>jobs</b> <b>-Z</b> [<u>title</u>] (+)
               The  first  form  lists  the  active  jobs.  With <b>-l</b>, lists process IDs in addition to the normal
               information.  On TCF systems, prints the site on which each job is executing.

               The second form with the <b>-Z</b> option sets the process title to <u>title</u>  using  <u><a href="../man3/setproctitle.3.html">setproctitle</a></u>(3)  where
               available.  If no <u>title</u> is provided, the process title will be cleared.

       <b>kill</b> <b>-l</b>
       <b>kill</b> [<b>-s</b> <u>signal</u>] <b>%</b><u>job</u>|<u>pid</u> ...
               The first form lists the signal names.

               The second form sends the specified <u>signal</u> (or, if none is given, the TERM (terminate) signal) to
               the  specified  jobs  or  processes.   <u>job</u>  may  be  a  number, a string, ‘’, ‘%’, ‘+’, or ‘-’ as
               described  under  “Jobs”.   Signals  are  either  given  by  number  or  by  name  (as  given  in
               <u><a href="file:/usr/include/signal.h">/usr/include/signal.h</a></u>, stripped of the prefix ‘SIG’).

               There is no default <u>job</u>; entering just
                     <b>kill</b>
               does  not  send a signal to the current job.  If the signal being sent is TERM (terminate) or HUP
               (hangup), then the job or process is sent a CONT (continue) signal as well.

       <b>limit</b> [<b>-h</b>] [<u>resource</u> [<u>maximum-use</u>]]
               Limits the consumption by the current process and each process it  creates  to  not  individually
               exceed <u>maximum-use</u> on the specified <u>resource</u>.

               If no <u>maximum-use</u> is given, then the current limit for <u>resource</u> is printed.

               If no <u>resource</u> is given, then all limitations are given.

               If the <b>-h</b> flag is given, the hard limits are used instead of the current limits.  The hard limits
               impose  a  ceiling  on  the values of the current limits.  Only the super-user may raise the hard
               limits, but a user may lower or raise the current limits within the legal range.

               Controllable <u>resource</u> types currently include (if supported by the OS):

                     <u>resource</u>      <b>Resource</b> <b>description</b>

                     <b>concurrency</b>   Maximum number of threads for this process.

                     <b>coredumpsize</b>  Size of the largest core dump that will be created.

                                   program text.

                     <b>descriptors</b> or <b>openfiles</b>
                                   Maximum number of open files for this process.

                     <b>filesize</b>      Largest single file which can be created.

                     <b>heapsize</b>      Maximum amount of memory a process may allocate per <u><a href="../man2/brk.2.html">brk</a></u>(2) system call.

                     <b>kqueues</b>       Maximum number of kqueues allocated for this process.

                     <b>maxlocks</b>      Maximum number of locks for this user.

                     <b>maxmessage</b>    Maximum number of bytes in POSIX mqueues for this user.

                     <b>maxnice</b>       Maximum  nice priority the user is allowed to raise mapped from [19...-20] to
                                   [0...39] for this user.

                     <b>maxproc</b>       Maximum number of simultaneous processes for this user id.

                     <b>maxrtprio</b>     Maximum realtime priority for this user.

                     <b>maxrttime</b>     Timeout for RT tasks in microseconds for this user.

                     <b>maxsignal</b>     Maximum number of pending signals for this user.

                     <b>maxthread</b>     Maximum number of simultaneous threads (lightweight processes) for this  user
                                   id.

                     <b>memorylocked</b>  Maximum size which a process may lock into memory using <u><a href="../man2/mlock.2.html">mlock</a></u>(2).

                     <b>memoryuse</b>     Maximum  amount  of  physical  memory a process may have allocated to it at a
                                   given time.

                     <b>posixlocks</b>    Maximum number of POSIX advisory locks for this user.

                     <b>pseudoterminals</b>
                                   Maximum number of pseudo-terminals for this user.

                     <b>sbsize</b>        Maximum size of socket buffer usage for this user.

                     <b>stacksize</b>     Maximum size of the automatically-extended stack region.

                     <b>swapsize</b>      Maximum amount of swap space reserved or used for this user.

                     <b>threads</b>       Maximum number of threads for this process.

                     <b>vmemoryuse</b>    Maximum amount of virtual memory a process may have  allocated  to  it  at  a
                                   given time (address space).

               <u>maximum-use</u> may be given as a (floating point or integer) number followed by a scale factor.  For
               all  limits  other  than  <b>cputime</b>  the  default scale is ‘k’ or ‘kilobytes’ (1024 bytes); a scale
               factor of ‘m’ or ‘megabytes’ (1048576 bytes) or ‘g’ or ‘gigabytes’ (1073741824 bytes) may also be
               used.  For <b>cputime</b> the default scaling is ‘seconds’, while ‘m’ for minutes or ‘h’ for hours, or a
               time of the form ‘<u>mm</u><b>:</b><u>ss</u>’ giving minutes and seconds may be used.

               If <u>maximum-use</u> is ‘unlimited’, then the limitation on the specified <u>resource</u> is removed (this  is
               equivalent to the <b>unlimit</b> builtin command).

               For both <u>resource</u> names and scale factors, unambiguous prefixes of the names suffice.

       <b>log</b> (+)
               Prints  the  <b>watch</b>  shell  variable and reports on each user indicated in <b>watch</b> who is logged in,
               regardless of when they last logged in.  See also <b>watchlog</b>.

       <b>login</b>   Terminates a login shell, replacing it with an instance of <u><a href="file:/bin/login">/bin/login</a></u>.  This is one  way  to  log
               off, included for compatibility with <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1).

       <b>logout</b>  Terminates a login shell.  Especially useful if <b>ignoreeof</b> is set.

       <b>ls-F</b> [<b>-</b><u>switch</u> ...] [<u>file</u> ...] (+)
               Lists files like
                     <b>ls</b> <b>-F</b>
               but much faster.

               <b>ls-F</b> identifies each type of special file in the listing with a special character suffix:

                     <b>Suffix</b>  <b>Special</b> <b>file</b> <b>type</b>

                     <b>/</b>       Directory.
                     <b>*</b>       Executable.
                     <b>#</b>       Block device.
                     <b>%</b>       Character device.
                     <b>|</b>       Named pipe (systems with named pipes only).
                     <b>=</b>       Socket (systems with sockets only).
                     <b>@</b>       Symbolic link (systems with symbolic links only).
                     <b>+</b>       Hidden directory (AIX only) or context dependent (HP/UX only).
                     <b>:</b>       Network special (HP/UX only).

               If  the  <b>listlinks</b>  shell  variable is set, symbolic links are identified in more detail (on only
               systems that have them, of course):

                     <b>Suffix</b>  <b>Symbolic</b> <b>link</b> <b>type</b>

                     <b>@</b>       Symbolic link to a non-directory.
                     <b>&gt;</b>       Symbolic link to a directory.
                     <b>&amp;</b>       Orphaned (broken) symbolic link.

               <b>listlinks</b> also slows down <b>ls-F</b> and causes partitions holding files pointed to by  symbolic  links
               to be mounted.

               If  the  <b>listflags</b>  shell  variable is set to ‘x’, ‘a’, or ‘A’, or any combination thereof (e.g.,
               ‘xA’), they are used as flags to <b>ls-F</b>, making it act like
                     ls -xF
                     ls -Fa
                     ls -FA

               or a combination, for example
                     <b>ls</b> <b>-FxA</b>

               On machines where
                     <b>ls</b> <b>-C</b>
               is not the default, <b>ls-F</b> acts like
                     <b>ls</b> <b>-CF</b>
               unless <b>listflags</b> contains an ‘x’, in which case it acts like
                     <b>ls</b> <b>-xF</b>

               <b>ls-F</b> passes its arguments to <u><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></u>(1) if it is given any switches, so
                     <b>alias</b> <b>ls</b> <b>ls-F</b>
               generally does the right thing.

               The <b>ls-F</b> builtin can list files using different colors depending on the file type  or  extension.
               See  the  <b>color</b>  shell  variable  and  the  CLICOLOR_FORCE,  LSCOLORS,  and LS_COLORS environment
               variables.

       <b>migrate</b> [<b>-</b><u>site</u>] <u>pid</u>|<b>%</b><u>jobid</u> ... (+)
       <b>migrate</b> <b>-</b><u>site</u> (+)
               The first form migrates the process or job to the site specified or the default  site  determined
               by the system path.  (TCF only)

               The second form is equivalent to
                     <b>migrate</b> <b>-</b><u>site</u> <b>$$</b>
               in  that  it  migrates the current process to the specified site.  Migrating the shell itself can
               cause unexpected behavior, because the shell does not like to lose its tty.  (TCF only)

       <b>newgrp</b> [<b>-</b>] [<u>group</u>] (+)
               Equivalent to
                     <b>exec</b> <b>newgrp</b>
               as per <u><a href="../man1/newgrp.1.html">newgrp</a></u>(1).  Available only if the shell was so compiled; see the <b>version</b> shell variable.

       <b>nice</b> [<b>+</b><u>number</u>] [<u>command</u>]
               Increments the scheduling priority for the shell by <u>number</u>,  or,  without  <u>number</u>,  by  4.   With
               <u>command</u>,  runs  <u>command</u>  at  the  appropriate priority.  The greater the <u>number</u>, the less cpu the
               process gets.  The super-user may decrement the priority by using
                     <b>nice</b> <b>-</b><u>number</u> <b>...</b>

               <u>command</u> is always executed in a sub-shell, and the restrictions placed on commands in  simple  <b>if</b>
               statements apply.

       <b>nohup</b> [<u>command</u>]
               With  <u>command</u>,  runs <u>command</u> such that it will ignore hangup signals.  Note that commands may set
               their own response to hangups, overriding <b>nohup</b>.

               Without an argument, causes the non-interactive shell only to ignore hangups for the remainder of
               the script.  See also “Signal handling” and the <b>hup</b> builtin command.

       <b>notify</b> [<b>%</b><u>job</u> ...]
               Causes the shell to notify the user asynchronously when the status of any of the  specified  jobs
               (or,  without  <b>%</b><u>job</u>,  the  current  job)  changes, instead of waiting until the next prompt as is
               usual.  <u>job</u> may be a number, a string, ‘’, ‘%’, ‘+’, or ‘-’ as described under “Jobs”.  See  also
               the <b>notify</b> shell variable.

       <b>onintr</b> [<b>-</b>|<u>label</u>]
               Controls  the  action of the shell on interrupts.  Without arguments, restores the default action
               of the shell on interrupts, which is to terminate shell scripts or  to  return  to  the  terminal
               command input level.

               With ‘-’, causes all interrupts to be ignored.

               With <u>label</u>, causes the shell to execute a
                     <b>goto</b> <u>label</u>
               when an interrupt is received or a child process terminates because it was interrupted.

               <b>onintr</b>  is  ignored  if  the shell is running detached and in system startup files (see “FILES”),
               where interrupts are disabled anyway.

       <b>popd</b> [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-l</b>] [<b>-n</b>|<b>-v</b>] [<b>+</b><u>n</u>]
               Without arguments, pops the directory stack and returns to the new top directory.

               With a number ‘+<u>n</u>’, discards the <u>n</u>th entry in the stack.

               Finally, all forms of <b>popd</b> print the final directory stack,  just  like  <b>dirs</b>.   The  <b>pushdsilent</b>
               shell  variable  can be set to prevent this and the <b>-p</b> flag can be given to override <b>pushdsilent</b>.
               The <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b>, and <b>-v</b> flags have the same effect on <b>popd</b> as on <b>dirs</b>.  (+)

       <b>printenv</b> [<u>name</u>] (+)
               Prints the names and values of all  environment  variables  or,  with  <u>name</u>,  the  value  of  the
               environment variable <u>name</u>.

       <b>pushd</b> [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-l</b>] [<b>-n</b>|<b>-v</b>] [<u>name</u>|<b>+</b><u>n</u>]
               Without arguments, exchanges the top two elements of the directory stack.  If <b>pushdtohome</b> is set,
               <b>pushd</b> without arguments acts as
                     <b>pushd</b> <b>~</b>
               like <b>cd</b>.  (+)

               With <u>name</u>, pushes the current working directory onto the directory stack and changes to <u>name</u>.  If
               <u>name</u>  is  ‘-’  it is interpreted as the previous working directory (see “Filename substitution”).
               (+) If <b>dunique</b> is set, <b>pushd</b> removes any instances of <u>name</u> from the stack before pushing it  onto
               the stack.  (+)

               With  a  number ‘+<u>n</u>’, rotates the <u>n</u>th element of the directory stack around to be the top element
               and changes to it.  If <b>dextract</b> is set, however,
                     <b>pushd</b> <b>+</b><u>n</u>
               extracts the <u>n</u>th directory, pushes it onto the top of the stack and changes to it.  (+)

               Finally, all forms of <b>pushd</b> print the final directory stack, just  like  <b>dirs</b>.   The  <b>pushdsilent</b>
               shell  variable  can be set to prevent this and the <b>-p</b> flag can be given to override <b>pushdsilent</b>.
               The <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b>, and <b>-v</b> flags have the same effect on <b>pushd</b> as on <b>dirs</b>.  (+)

       <b>rehash</b>  Causes the internal hash table of the contents of the directories in  the  <b>path</b>  variable  to  be
               recomputed.   This  is  needed  if  the <b>autorehash</b> shell variable is not set and new commands are
               added to directories in <b>path</b> while you are logged in.  With <b>autorehash</b>, a  new  command  will  be
               found  automatically,  except in the special case where another command of the same name which is
               located in a different directory already exists in the hash table.  Also  flushes  the  cache  of
               home directories built by tilde expansion.

       <b>repeat</b> <u>count</u> <u>command</u>
               The  specified  <u>command</u>, which is subject to the same restrictions as the <u>command</u> in the one line
               <b>if</b> statement above, is executed <u>count</u> times.  I/O redirections occur exactly once, even if  <u>count</u>
               is 0.

       <b>rootnode</b> <b>//</b><u>nodename</u> (+)
               Changes  the rootnode to <u>//nodename</u>, so that ‘/’ will be interpreted as ‘//<u>nodename</u>’.  (Domain/OS
               only)

       <b>sched</b> (+)
       <b>sched</b> [<b>+</b>]<u>hh</u><b>:</b><u>mm</u> <u>command</u> (+)
       <b>sched</b> <b>-</b><u>n</u> (+)
               The first form prints the scheduled-event list.  The <b>sched</b> shell variable may be  set  to  define
               the format in which the scheduled-event list is printed.

               The second form adds <u>command</u> to the scheduled-event list.  For example,

                     &gt; sched 11:00 echo It\'s eleven o\'clock.

               causes the shell to echo
                     <b>It's</b> <b>eleven</b> <b>o'clock.</b>
               at 11 AM.

               The time may be in 12-hour AM/PM format

                     &gt; sched 5pm set prompt='[%h] It\'s after 5; go home: &gt;'

               or may be relative to the current time:

                     &gt; sched +2:15 /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1 -sother

               A relative time specification may not use AM/PM format.

               The third form removes item <u>n</u> from the event list:

                     &gt; sched
                     1  Wed Apr  4 15:42  /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1 -sother
                     2  Wed Apr  4 17:00  set prompt=[%h] It's after 5; go home: &gt;
                     &gt; sched -2
                     &gt; sched
                     1  Wed Apr  4 15:42  /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1 -sother

               A  command  in the scheduled-event list is executed just before the first prompt is printed after
               the time when the command is scheduled.  It is possible to miss the exact time when  the  command
               is  to be run, but an overdue command will execute at the next prompt.  A command which comes due
               while the shell is waiting for user input is executed immediately.  However, normal operation  of
               an  already-running command will not be interrupted so that a scheduled-event list element may be
               run.

               This mechanism is similar to, but not the same as, the <u><a href="../man1/at.1.html">at</a></u>(1) command on some Unix  systems.   Its
               major  disadvantage  is  that  it may not run a command at exactly the specified time.  Its major
               advantage is that because <b>sched</b> runs directly from the shell, it has access  to  shell  variables
               and  other structures.  This provides a mechanism for changing one's working environment based on
               the time of day.

       <b>set</b>
       <b>set</b> <u>name</u> ...
       <b>set</b> <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>word</u> ...
       <b>set</b> [<b>-r</b>] [<b>-f</b>|<b>-l</b>] <u>name</u><b>=(</b><u>wordlist</u><b>)</b> ... (+)
       <b>set</b> <u>name</u><b>[</b><u>index</u><b>]=</b><u>word</u> ...
       <b>set</b> <b>-r</b> (+)
       <b>set</b> <b>-r</b> <u>name</u> ... (+)
       <b>set</b> <b>-r</b> <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>word</u> ... (+)
               The first form of the command prints the value of all shell variables.  Variables  which  contain
               more than a single word print as a parenthesized word list.

               The second form sets <u>name</u> to the null string.

               The third form sets <u>name</u> to the single <u>word</u>.

               The fourth form sets <u>name</u> to the list of words in <u>wordlist</u>.

               In  all  cases  the value is command and filename expanded.  If <b>-r</b> is specified, the value is set
               read-only.  If <b>-f</b> or <b>-l</b> are specified, set only unique words keeping their order.  <b>-f</b> prefers the
               first occurrence of a word, and <b>-l</b> the last.

               The fifth form sets the <u>index</u>'th component of <u>name</u> to <u>word</u>; this component must already exist.

               The sixth form lists only the names of all shell variables that are read-only.

               The seventh form makes <u>name</u> read-only, whether or not it has a value.

               The eighth form is the same as the third form, but make <u>name</u> read-only at the same time.

               These arguments can be repeated to set and/or make read-only multiple variables in a  single  set
               command.   Note,  however,  that  variable expansion happens for all arguments before any setting
               occurs.  Note also that ‘=’ can be adjacent to both <u>name</u> and  <u>word</u>  or  separated  from  both  by
               whitespace, but cannot be adjacent to only one or the other.  See also the <b>unset</b> builtin command.

       <b>setenv</b> [<u>name</u> [<u>value</u>]]
               Without arguments, prints the names and values of all environment variables.

               With <u>name</u>, sets the environment variable <u>name</u> to <u>value</u> or, without <u>value</u>, to the null string.

       <b>setpath</b> <u>path</u> (+)
               Equivalent to <u><a href="../man1/setpath.1.html">setpath</a></u>(1).  (Mach only)

       <b>setspath</b> <b>LOCAL</b>|<u>site</u>|<u>cpu</u> ... (+)
               Sets the system execution path.  (TCF only)

       <b>settc</b> <u>cap</u> <u>value</u> (+)
               Tells  the  shell  to believe that the terminal capability <u>cap</u> (as defined in <u><a href="../man5/termcap.5.html">termcap</a></u>(5)) has the
               value <u>value</u>.  No sanity checking is done.  Concept terminal users may have to
                     <b>settc</b> <b>xn</b> <b>no</b>
               to get proper wrapping at the rightmost column.

       <b>setty</b> [<b>-d</b>|<b>-q</b>|<b>-x</b>] [<b>-a</b>] [[<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<u>mode</u>] (+)
               Controls which tty modes (see “Terminal management (+)”) the shell does not allow to change.  <b>-d</b>,
               <b>-q</b>, or <b>-x</b> tells <b>setty</b> to act on the ‘edit’, ‘quote’, or ‘execute’ set of tty modes  respectively;
               without <b>-d</b>, <b>-q</b>, or <b>-x</b>, ‘execute’ is used.

               Without  other arguments, <b>setty</b> lists the modes in the chosen set which are fixed on (‘<b>+</b><u>mode</u>’) or
               off (‘<b>-</b><u>mode</u>’).  The available modes, and thus the display, vary from system to system.  With  <b>-a</b>,
               lists all tty modes in the chosen set whether or not they are fixed.  With <b>+</b><u>mode</u>, <b>-</b><u>mode</u>, or <u>mode</u>,
               fixes <u>mode</u> on or off or removes control from <u>mode</u> in the chosen set.  For example,
                     <b>setty</b> <b>+echok</b> <b>echoe</b>
               fixes  ‘echok’ mode on and allows commands to turn ‘echoe’ mode on or off, both when the shell is
               executing commands.

       <b>setxvers</b> [<u>string</u>] (+)
               Set the experimental version prefix to <u>string</u>, or removes it if <u>string</u> is omitted.  (TCF only)

       <b>shift</b> [<u>variable</u>]
               Without arguments, discards <b>argv</b>[1] and shifts the members of <b>argv</b> to the left.  It is  an  error
               for <b>argv</b> not to be set or to have fewer than one word as value.

               With <u>variable</u>, performs the same function on <u>variable</u>.

       <b>source</b> [<b>-h</b>] <u>name</u> [<u>args</u> ...]
               The  shell  reads  and  executes  commands from <u>name</u>.  The commands are not placed on the history
               list.  If any <u>args</u> are given, they are placed in <b>argv</b>.  (+) <b>source</b> commands  may  be  nested;  if
               they  are  nested  too deeply the shell may run out of file descriptors.  An error in a <b>source</b> at
               any level terminates all nested <b>source</b> commands.

               With <b>-h</b>, commands are placed on the history list instead of being executed, much like
                     <b>history</b> <b>-L</b>

       <b>stop</b> <b>%</b><u>job</u>|<u>pid</u> ...
               Stops the specified jobs or processes which are executing  in  the  background.   <u>job</u>  may  be  a
               number, a string, ‘’, ‘%’, ‘+’, or ‘-’ as described under “Jobs”.

               There is no default <u>job</u>; entering just
                     <b>stop</b>
               does not stop the current job.

       <b>suspend</b>
               Causes  the shell to stop in its tracks, much as if it had been sent a stop signal with <b>^Z</b>.  This
               is most often used to stop shells started by <u><a href="../man1/su.1.html">su</a></u>(1).

       <b>switch</b> <b>(</b><u>string</u><b>)</b>
       <b>case</b> <u>str1</u>:
           <b>...</b>
           <b>breaksw</b>
       <b>...</b>
       <b>default:</b>
           <b>...</b>
           <b>breaksw</b>
       <b>endsw</b>   Each case label is successively matched, against the specified <u>string</u> which is first command  and
               filename expanded.  The file metacharacters ‘*’, ‘?’, and ‘[...]’ may be used in the case labels,
               which  are  variable expanded.  If none of the labels match before a <b>default</b> label is found, then
               the execution begins after the <b>default</b> label.  Each case label and the <b>default</b> label must  appear
               at  the  beginning  of a line.  The command <b>breaksw</b> causes execution to continue after the <b>endsw</b>.
               Otherwise control may fall through case labels and default labels as in C.  If no  label  matches
               and there is no default, execution continues after the <b>endsw</b>.

       <b>telltc</b> (+)
               Lists the values of all terminal capabilities (see <u><a href="../man5/termcap.5.html">termcap</a></u>(5)).

       <b>termname</b> [<u>termtype</u>] (+)
               Tests  if  <u>termtype</u>  (or  the  current value of TERM if no <u>termtype</u> is given) has an entry in the
               hosts <u><a href="../man5/termcap.5.html">termcap</a></u>(5) or <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5) database.  Prints the terminal type to stdout and returns 0 if an
               entry is present otherwise returns 1.

       <b>time</b> [<u>command</u>]
               Executes <u>command</u> (which must be a simple command, not an alias, a pipeline, a command list  or  a
               parenthesized  command  list) and prints a time summary as described under the <b>time</b> variable.  If
               necessary, an extra shell is created to print the time statistic when the command completes.

               Without <u>command</u>, prints a time summary for the current shell and its children.

       <b>umask</b> [<u>value</u>]
               Sets the file creation mask to <u>value</u>, which is given in octal.  Common values for  the  mask  are
               002,  giving  all access to the group and read and execute access to others, and 022, giving read
               and execute access to the group and others.

               Without <u>value</u>, prints the current file creation mask.

       <b>unalias</b> <u>pattern</u>
               Removes all aliases whose names match <u>pattern</u>.  Thus
                     <b>unalias</b> <b>*</b>
               removes all aliases.  It is not an error for nothing to be <b>unalias</b>ed.

       <b>uncomplete</b> <u>pattern</u> (+)
               Removes all completions whose names match <u>pattern</u>.  Thus
                     <b>uncomplete</b> <b>*</b>
               removes all completions.  It is not an error for nothing to be <b>uncomplete</b>d.

       <b>unhash</b>  Disables use of the internal hash table to speed location of executed programs.

       <b>universe</b> <u>universe</u> (+)
               Sets the universe to <u>universe</u>.  (Masscomp/RTU only)

       <b>unlimit</b> [<b>-hf</b>] [<u>resource</u>]
               Removes the limitation on <u>resource</u> or, if no <u>resource</u> is specified, all <u>resource</u> limitations.

               With <b>-h</b>, the corresponding hard limits are removed.  Only the super-user may do this.

               Note that <b>unlimit</b> may not exit successful, since most systems do  not  allow  <b>descriptors</b>  to  be
               unlimited.

               With <b>-f</b> errors are ignored.

       <b>unset</b> <u>pattern</u>
               Removes all variables whose names match <u>pattern</u>, unless they are read-only.  Thus
                     <b>unset</b> <b>*</b>
               removes all variables unless they are read-only; this is a bad idea.

               It is not an error for nothing to be <b>unset</b>.

       <b>unsetenv</b> <u>pattern</u>
               Removes all environment variables whose names match <u>pattern</u>.  Thus
                     <b>unsetenv</b> <b>*</b>
               removes all environment variables; this is a bad idea.

               It is not an error for nothing to be <b>unsetenv</b>ed.

       <b>ver</b> [<u>systype</u> [<u>command</u>]] (+)
               Without arguments, prints SYSTYPE.

               With <u>systype</u>, sets SYSTYPE to <u>systype</u>.

               With <u>systype</u> and <u>command</u>, executes <u>command</u> under <u>systype</u>.  <u>systype</u> may be ‘bsd4.3’ or ‘sys5.3’.

               (Domain/OS only)

       <b>wait</b>    The  shell waits for all background jobs.  If the shell is interactive, an interrupt will disrupt
               the wait and cause the shell to print the names and job numbers of all outstanding jobs.

       <b>warp</b> <u>universe</u> (+)
               Sets the universe to <u>universe</u>.  (Convex/OS only)

       <b>watchlog</b> (+)
               An alternate name for the <b>log</b> builtin command.  Available only if the shell was so compiled;  see
               the <b>version</b> shell variable.

       <b>where</b> <u>command</u> (+)
               Reports all known instances of <u>command</u>, including aliases, builtins and executables in <b>path</b>.

       <b>which</b> <u>command</u> (+)
               Displays the command that will be executed by the shell after substitutions, <b>path</b> searching, etc.
               The builtin command is just like <u><a href="../man1/which.1.html">which</a></u>(1), but it correctly reports <b>tcsh</b> aliases and builtins and
               is 10 to 100 times faster.  See also the <b>which-command</b> editor command.

       <b>while</b> <b>(</b><u>expr</u><b>)</b>
       <b>...</b>
       <b>end</b>     Executes  the  commands  between  the  <b>while</b>  and  the matching <b>end</b> while <u>expr</u> (an expression, as
               described under “Expressions”) evaluates non-zero.  <b>while</b> and <b>end</b>  must  appear  alone  on  their
               input  lines.   <b>break</b> and <b>continue</b> may be used to terminate or continue the loop prematurely.  If
               the input is a terminal, the user is prompted the first time through the loop as with <b>foreach</b>.

   <b>Special</b> <b>aliases</b> <b>(+)</b>
       If set, each of these aliases executes automatically at the  indicated  time.   They  are  all  initially
       undefined.

       Supported special aliases are:

       <b>beepcmd</b>
               Runs when the shell wants to ring the terminal bell.

       <b>cwdcmd</b>  Runs after every change of working directory.  For example, if the user is working on an X window
               system  using  <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) and a re-parenting window manager that supports title bars such as <u><a href="../man1/twm.1.html">twm</a></u>(1)
               and does

                     &gt; alias cwdcmd  'echo -n "^[]2;${HOST}:$cwd ^G"'

               then the shell will change the title of the running <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) to be the name of the host,  a  ‘:’,
               and the full current working directory.  A fancier way to do that is

                     &gt; alias cwdcmd 'echo -n "^[]2;${HOST}:$cwd^G^[]1;${HOST}^G"'

               This  will  put  the hostname and working directory on the title bar but only the hostname in the
               icon manager menu.

               Note that putting a <b>cd</b>, <b>pushd</b>, or <b>popd</b> in <b>cwdcmd</b> may cause an infinite loop.  It is the  author's
               opinion that anyone doing so will get what they deserve.

       <b>jobcmd</b>  Runs  before  each  command gets executed, or when the command changes state.  This is similar to
               <b>postcmd</b>, but it does not print builtins.

                     &gt; alias jobcmd  'echo -n "^[]2\;\!#:q^G"'

               then executing
                     <b>vi</b> <b>foo.c</b>
               will put the command string in the xterm title bar.

       <b>helpcommand</b>
               Invoked by the <b>run-help</b> editor command.  The command name for which help is sought is  passed  as
               sole argument.  For example, if one does

                     &gt; alias helpcommand '\!:1 --help'

               then  the  help  display  of  the  command  itself  will  be  invoked, using the GNU help calling
               convention.

               Currently there is no easy way to account for various calling conventions  (e.g.,  the  customary
               Unix ‘-h’), except by using a table of many commands.

       <b>periodic</b>
               Runs  every  <b>tperiod</b>  minutes.   This  provides  a  convenient  means  for checking on common but
               infrequent changes such as new mail.  For example, if one does

                     &gt; set tperiod = 30
                     &gt; alias periodic checknews

               then the <u><a href="../man1/checknews.1.html">checknews</a></u>(1) program runs every 30 minutes.

               If <b>periodic</b> is set but <b>tperiod</b> is unset or set to 0, <b>periodic</b> behaves like <b>precmd</b>.

       <b>precmd</b>  Runs just before each prompt is printed.  For example, if one does

                     &gt; alias precmd date

               then <u><a href="../man1/date.1.html">date</a></u>(1) runs just before the shell prompts for each command.

               There are no limits on what <b>precmd</b> can be set to do, but discretion should be used.

       <b>postcmd</b>
               Runs before each command gets executed.

                     &gt; alias postcmd  'echo -n "^[]2\;\!#:q^G"'

               then executing
                     <b>vi</b> <b>foo.c</b>
               will put the command string in the xterm title bar.

       <b>shell</b>   Specifies the interpreter for executable scripts which do not themselves specify an  interpreter.
               The  first  word  should  be  a  full  path  name to the desired interpreter (e.g., ‘/bin/csh’ or
               ‘/usr/local/bin/tcsh’).

   <b>Special</b> <b>shell</b> <b>variables</b>
       The variables described in this section have special meaning to the shell.

       The shell sets <b>addsuffix</b>, <b>argv</b>, <b>autologout</b>, <b>csubstnonl</b>, <b>command</b>,  <b>echo_style</b>,  <b>edit</b>,  <b>gid</b>,  <b>group</b>,  <b>home</b>,
       <b>loginsh</b>,  <b>oid</b>,  <b>path</b>,  <b>prompt</b>, <b>prompt2</b>, <b>prompt3</b>, <b>shell</b>, <b>shlvl</b>, <b>tcsh</b>, <b>term</b>, <b>tty</b>, <b>uid</b>, <b>user</b>, and <b>version</b> at
       startup; they do not change thereafter unless changed by the user.  The shell updates <b>cwd</b>, <b>dirstack</b>, <b>owd</b>,
       and <b>status</b> when necessary, and sets <b>logout</b> on logout.

       The shell synchronizes <b>group</b>, <b>home</b>, <b>path</b>, <b>shlvl</b>, <b>term</b>, and <b>user</b> with the  environment  variables  of  the
       same  names: whenever the environment variable changes the shell changes the corresponding shell variable
       to match (unless the shell variable is read-only) and vice versa.  Note that although <b>cwd</b>  and  PWD  have
       identical  meanings,  they are not synchronized in this manner, and that the shell automatically converts
       between the different formats of <b>path</b> and PATH.

       Supported special shell variables are:

       <b>addsuffix</b> (+)
               If set, filename completion adds ‘/’ to the end of directories and a space to the end  of  normal
               files when they are matched exactly.  Set by default.

       <b>afsuser</b> (+)
               If  set,  <b>autologout</b>'s autolock feature uses its value instead of the local username for kerberos
               authentication.

       <b>ampm</b> (+)
               If set, all times are shown in 12-hour AM/PM format.

       <b>anyerror</b> (+)
               This variable selects what is  propagated  to  the  value  of  the  <b>status</b>  variable.   For  more
               information see the description of the <b>status</b> variable below.

       <b>argv</b>    The arguments to the shell.  Positional parameters are taken from <b>argv</b>, i.e., ‘$1’ is replaced by
               ‘$argv[1]’, etc.  Set by default, but usually empty in interactive shells.

       <b>autocorrect</b> (+)
               If set, the <b>spell-word</b> editor command is invoked automatically before each completion attempt.

       <b>autoexpand</b> (+)
               If  set,  the  <b>expand-history</b>  editor  command  is  invoked  automatically before each completion
               attempt.

               If this is set to ‘onlyhistory’, then only history will be expanded and a second completion  will
               expand filenames.

       <b>autolist</b> (+)
               If set, possibilities are listed after an ambiguous completion.

               If  set  to  ‘ambiguous’,  possibilities  are  listed  only  when  no new characters are added by
               completion.

       <b>autologout</b> (+)
               The first word is the number of minutes of inactivity  before  automatic  logout.   The  optional
               second  word  is  the  number  of minutes of inactivity before automatic locking.  When the shell
               automatically logs out, it prints
                     <b>auto-logout</b>
               sets the variable <b>logout</b> to ‘automatic’ and exits.  When the shell automatically locks, the  user
               is  required  to  enter  their  password  to continue working.  Five incorrect attempts result in
               automatic logout.

               Set to ‘60’ (automatic logout after 60 minutes, and no locking) by default in login and superuser
               shells, but not if the shell thinks it is running  under  a  window  system  (i.e.,  the  DISPLAY
               environment variable is set), the tty is a pseudo-tty (pty) or the shell was not so compiled (see
               the <b>version</b> shell variable).

               Unset  <b>autologout</b>  or set it to ‘0’ to disable automatic logout.  See also the <b>afsuser</b> and <b>logout</b>
               shell variables.

       <b>autorehash</b> (+)
               If set, the internal hash table of the contents of the directories in the <b>path</b> variable  will  be
               recomputed  if  a  command  is  not  found in the hash table.  In addition, the list of available
               commands will be rebuilt for each command completion or spelling correction  attempt  if  set  to
               ‘complete’ or ‘correct’ respectively; if set to ‘always’, this will be done for both cases.

       <b>backslash_quote</b> (+)
               If  set,  backslashes  (`\') always quote ‘\’, ‘'’, and ‘"’.  This may make complex quoting tasks
               easier, but it can cause syntax errors in <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) scripts.

       <b>catalog</b>
               The file name of the message catalog.  If set, <b>tcsh</b> uses <u>tcsh.${catalog}</u>  as  a  message  catalog
               instead of default <u>tcsh</u>.

       <b>cdpath</b>  A  list  of  directories in which <b>cd</b> should search for subdirectories if they aren't found in the
               current directory.

       <b>cdtohome</b> (+)
               If not set, <b>cd</b> requires a directory <u>name</u>, and will not go to the <b>home</b> directory if it's  omitted.
               This is set by default.

       <b>color</b>   If  set,  it  enables  color display for the builtin <b>ls-F</b> and it passes <b>--color=auto</b> to <u><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></u>(1) (or
               <b>--color=always</b> if CLICOLOR_FORCE is set).  Alternatively, it can be set to only  ‘ls-F’  or  only
               ‘ls’  to  enable color for a specific command.  Setting it to nothing is equivalent to setting it
               to ‘(ls-F ls)’.  Color is  disabled  if  the  output  is  not  directed  to  a  terminal,  unless
               CLICOLOR_FORCE is set.

       <b>colorcat</b>
               If  set,  it  enables  color  escape  sequence  for  NLS  message files, and display colorful NLS
               messages.

       <b>command</b> (+)
               If set, the command which was passed to the shell with the <b>-c</b> flag.

       <b>compat_expr</b> (+)
               If set, the shell will evaluate expressions right to left, like the original <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1).

       <b>complete</b> (+)
               If set to ‘igncase’, the completion becomes case insensitive.

               If set to ‘enhance’, completion  ignores  case  and  considers  hyphens  and  underscores  to  be
               equivalent;  it  will  also  treat  periods,  hyphens and underscores (‘.’, ‘-’, and ‘_’) as word
               separators.

               If set to ‘Enhance’, completion  matches  uppercase  and  underscore  characters  explicitly  and
               matches  lowercase  and  hyphens in a case-insensitive manner; it will treat periods, hyphens and
               underscores as word separators.

       <b>continue</b> (+)
               If set to a list of commands, the shell will continue the listed commands, instead of starting  a
               new one.

       <b>continue_args</b> (+)
               Same as continue, but the shell will execute:

                     echo `pwd` $argv &gt; <a href="file:~/.">~/.</a>&lt;cmd&gt;_pause; %&lt;cmd&gt;

       <b>correct</b> (+)
               If set to ‘cmd’, commands are automatically spelling-corrected.

               If set to ‘complete’, commands are automatically completed.

               If set to ‘all’, the entire command line is corrected.

       <b>csubstnonl</b> (+)
               If  set,  newlines  and  carriage returns in command substitution are replaced by spaces.  Set by
               default.

       <b>cwd</b>     The full pathname of the current directory.  See also the <b>dirstack</b> and <b>owd</b> shell variables.

       <b>dextract</b> (+)
               If set,
                     <b>pushd</b> <b>+</b><u>n</u>
               extracts the <u>n</u>th directory from the directory stack rather than rotating it to the top.

       <b>dirsfile</b> (+)
               The default location in which
                     <b>dirs</b> <b>-S</b>
               and
                     <b>dirs</b> <b>-L</b>
               look for a history file.  If unset, <u><a href="file:~/.cshdirs">~/.cshdirs</a></u> is  used.   Because  only  <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u>  is  normally
               sourced before <u><a href="file:~/.cshdirs">~/.cshdirs</a></u>, <b>dirsfile</b> should be set in <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u> rather than <u><a href="file:~/.login">~/.login</a></u>.

       <b>dirstack</b> (+)
               An  array  of  all the directories on the directory stack.  ‘$dirstack[1]’ is the current working
               directory, ‘$dirstack[2]’ the first directory on the stack, etc.  Note that the  current  working
               directory  is  ‘$dirstack[1]’ but ‘=0’ in directory stack substitutions, etc.  One can change the
               stack arbitrarily by setting <b>dirstack</b>, but the first element (the current working  directory)  is
               always correct.  See also the <b>cwd</b> and <b>owd</b> shell variables.

       <b>dspmbyte</b> (+)
               Has an effect only if ‘dspm’ is listed as part of the <b>version</b> shell variable.

               If set to ‘euc’, it enables display and editing EUC-kanji(Japanese) code.

               If set to ‘sjis’, it enables display and editing Shift-JIS(Japanese) code.

               If set to ‘big5’, it enables display and editing Big5(Chinese) code.

               If set to ‘utf8’, it enables display and editing Utf8(Unicode) code.

               If  set  to  <u>exactly</u>  256  characters  in the following format, it enables display and editing of
               original multi-byte code format:

                     <b>&gt;</b> <b>set</b> <b>dspmbyte</b> <b>=</b> <u>NNN</u>...<u>[250</u> <u>characters]</u>...<u>NNN</u>

               Each character <u>N</u> in the 256 character value corresponds (from left to right) to the  ASCII  codes
               0x00, 0x01, 0x02, ..., 0xfd, 0xfe, 0xff at the same index.  Each character is set to number 0, 1,
               2 or 3, with the meaning:

                     <b>Number</b>  <b>Multi-byte</b> <b>purpose</b>

                     <b>0</b>       Not used for multi-byte characters.
                     <b>1</b>       Used for the first byte of a multi-byte character.
                     <b>2</b>       Used for the second byte of a multi-byte character.
                     <b>3</b>       Used for both the first byte and second byte of a multi-byte character.

               For example, if set to 256 characters starting with ‘001322’, the value is interpreted as:

                     <b>Character</b>    <b>ASCII</b>    <b>Multi-byte</b> <b>character</b> <b>use</b>

                     <b>0</b>            0x00     Not used.
                     <b>0</b>            0x01     Not used.
                     <b>1</b>            0x02     First byte.
                     <b>3</b>            0x03     First byte and second byte.
                     <b>2</b>            0x04     Second byte.
                     <b>2</b>            0x05     Second byte.

               The GNU coreutils version of <u><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></u>(1) cannot display multi-byte filenames without the <b>-N</b> (<b>--literal</b>)
               option.   If  you  are  using this version, set the second word of dspmbyte to ‘ls’.  If not, for
               example,
                     <b>ls-F</b> <b>-l</b>
               cannot display multi-byte filenames.

               Note that this variable can only be used if KANJI and DSPMBYTE has been defined at compile time.

       <b>dunique</b> (+)
               If set, <b>pushd</b> removes any instances of <u>name</u> from the stack before pushing it onto the stack.

       <b>echo</b>    If set, each command with its arguments is echoed just before it is  executed.   For  non-builtin
               commands  all  expansions  occur  before echoing.  Builtin commands are echoed before command and
               filename substitution, because these substitutions are then done  selectively.   Set  by  the  <b>-x</b>
               command line option.

       <b>echo_style</b> (+)
               The style of the <b>echo</b> builtin.  May be set to:

                     <b>Value</b>  <b>echo</b> <b>style</b>

                     <b>bsd</b>    Don't echo a newline if the first argument is <b>-n</b>; the default for <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1).

                     <b>sysv</b>   Recognize backslashed escape sequences in echo strings.

                     <b>both</b>   Recognize both the <b>-n</b> flag and backslashed escape sequences; the default for <b>tcsh</b>.

                     <b>none</b>   Recognize neither.

               Set  by  default  to the local system default.  The BSD and System V options are described in the
               <u><a href="../man1/echo.1.html">echo</a></u>(1) man pages on the appropriate systems.

       <b>edit</b> (+)
               If set, the command-line editor is used.  Set by default in interactive shells.

       <b>editors</b> (+)
               A list of command names for the <b>run-fg-editor</b> editor command to match.  If not  set,  the  EDITOR
               (‘ed’ if unset) and VISUAL (‘vi’ if unset) environment variables will be used instead.

       <b>ellipsis</b> (+)
               If  set,  the  ‘%c’,  ‘%.’,  and  ‘%C’  prompt sequences (see the <b>prompt</b> shell variable) indicate
               skipped directories with an ellipsis (‘...’) instead of ‘/&lt;<u>skipped</u><b>&gt;</b>’.

       <b>euid</b> (+)
               The user's effective user ID.

       <b>euser</b> (+)
               The first matching passwd entry name corresponding to the effective user ID.

       <b>fignore</b> (+)
               Lists file name suffixes to be ignored by completion.

       <b>filec</b>   In <b>tcsh</b>, completion is always used and this variable is ignored by default.

               If <b>edit</b> is unset, then the traditional <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) completion is used.

               If set in <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1), filename completion is used.

       <b>gid</b> (+)
               The user's real group ID.

       <b>globdot</b> (+)
               If set, wild-card glob patterns will match files and directories beginning with  ‘.’  except  for
               ‘<u>.</u>’ and ‘<u>..</u>’.

       <b>globstar</b> (+)
               If  set,  the ‘**’ and ‘***’ file glob patterns will match any string of characters including ‘/’
               traversing any existing sub-directories.  For example,
                     <b>ls</b> <b>**.c</b>
               will list all the .c files in the current directory tree.

               If used by itself, it will match zero or more sub-directories.  For example,
                     <b>ls</b> <b><a href="file:/usr/include/">/usr/include/</a>**/time.h</b>
               will list any file named ‘time.h’ in the <u><a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a></u> directory tree; whereas
                     <b>ls</b> <b><a href="file:/usr/include/">/usr/include/</a>**time.h</b>
               will match any file in the <u><a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a></u> directory tree ending in ‘time.h’.

               To prevent problems with recursion, the ‘**’ glob-pattern will not descend into a  symbolic  link
               containing a directory.  To override this, use ‘***’.

       <b>group</b> (+)
               The user's group name.

       <b>highlight</b>
               If  set,  the incremental search match (in <b>i-search-back</b> and <b>i-search-fwd</b>) and the region between
               the mark and the cursor are highlighted in reverse video.

               Highlighting requires more frequent terminal writes, which introduces  extra  overhead.   If  you
               care about terminal performance, you may want to leave this unset.

       <b>histchars</b>
               A string value determining the characters used in “History substitution”.

               The  first  character  of  its value is used as the history substitution character, replacing the
               default character ‘!’.

               The second character of its value replaces the character ‘^’ in quick substitutions.

       <b>histdup</b> (+)
               Controls handling of duplicate entries in the history list.

               If set to ‘all’ only unique history events are entered in the history list.

               If set to ‘prev’ and the last history event is the same as the current command, then the  current
               command is not entered in the history.

               If set to ‘erase’ and the same event is found in the history list, that old event gets erased and
               the current one gets inserted.

               Note that the ‘prev’ and ‘all’ options renumber history events so there are no gaps.

       <b>histfile</b> (+)
               The default location in which
                     <b>history</b> <b>-S</b>
               and
                     <b>history</b> <b>-L</b>
               look for a history file.

               If unset, <u><a href="file:~/.history">~/.history</a></u> is used.

               <b>histfile</b>  is  useful  when  sharing  the  same home directory between different machines, or when
               saving separate histories on different terminals.  Because only  <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u>  is  normally  sourced
               before <u><a href="file:~/.history">~/.history</a></u>, <b>histfile</b> should be set in <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u> rather than <u><a href="file:~/.login">~/.login</a></u>.

       <b>histlit</b> (+)
               If  set, builtin and editor commands and the <b>savehist</b> mechanism use the literal (unexpanded) form
               of lines in the history list.  See also the <b>toggle-literal-history</b> editor command.

       <b>history</b>
               The first word indicates the number of history events to save.

               The optional second word (+) indicates the format in which history  is  printed;  if  not  given,
               ‘%h\t%T\t%R\n’ is used.  The format sequences are described below under <b>prompt</b>; note the variable
               meaning of ‘%R’.

               Set to ‘100’ by default.

       <b>home</b>    Initialized  to  the home directory of the invoker.  The filename expansion of ‘~’ refers to this
               variable.

       <b>ignoreeof</b>
               If set to the empty string or ‘0’ and the input device is a  terminal,  the  <b>end-of-file</b>  command
               (usually generated by the user by typing <b>^D</b> on an empty line) causes the shell to print
                     <b>Use</b> <b>"exit"</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>tcsh.</b>
               instead  of  exiting.  This prevents the shell from accidentally being killed.  Historically this
               setting exited after 26 successive EOF's to avoid infinite loops.

               If set to a number ‘<u>n</u>’, the shell ignores <u>n</u> - 1 consecutive <b>end-of-file</b>s and  exits  on  the  <u>n</u>th
               (+).

               If unset, ‘1’ is used, i.e., the shell exits on a single <b>^D</b>.

       <b>implicitcd</b> (+)
               If  set,  the  shell  treats  a  directory name typed as a command as though it were a request to
               change to that directory.

               If set to <b>verbose</b>, the change of directory is echoed to the standard output.

               This behavior is inhibited in non-interactive shell scripts, or for  command  strings  with  more
               than  one  word.  Changing directory takes precedence over executing a like-named command, but it
               is done after alias substitutions.  Tilde and variable expansions work as expected.

       <b>inputmode</b> (+)
               If set to ‘insert’ or ‘overwrite’, puts the editor into that input mode at the beginning of  each
               line.

       <b>killdup</b> (+)
               Controls handling of duplicate entries in the kill ring.

               If set to ‘all’ only unique strings are entered in the kill ring.

               If  set  to  ‘prev’ and the last killed string is the same as the current killed string, then the
               current string is not entered in the ring.

               If set to ‘erase’ and the same string is found in the kill ring, the old string is erased and the
               current one is inserted.

       <b>killring</b> (+)
               Indicates the number of killed strings to keep in memory.

               Set to ‘30’ by default.

               If unset or set to less than ‘2’, the shell will only keep the most recently killed string.

               Strings are put in the killring by the editor commands that delete (kill) strings of  text,  e.g.
               <b>backward-delete-word</b>,  <b>kill-line</b>,  etc,  as  well  as  the <b>copy-region-as-kill</b> command.  The <b>yank</b>
               editor command will yank the most recently killed string into the  command-line,  while  <b>yank-pop</b>
               (see “Editor commands (+)”) can be used to yank earlier killed strings.

       <b>listflags</b> (+)
               If  set  to  ‘x’, ‘a’, or ‘A’, or any combination thereof (e.g., ‘xA’), they are used as flags to
               <b>ls-F</b>, making it act like
                     ls -xF
                     ls -Fa
                     ls -FA

               or a combination, for example
                     <b>ls</b> <b>-FxA</b>

               If the first word contains ‘a’, shows all files (even if they start with a ‘.’).

               If the first word contains ‘A’, shows all files but ‘.’ and ‘..’.

               If the first word contains ‘x’, sorts across instead of down.

               If the second word of <b>listflags</b> is set, it is used as the path to <u><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></u>(1).

       <b>listjobs</b> (+)
               If set, all jobs are listed when a job is suspended.

               If set to ‘long’, the listing is in long format.

       <b>listlinks</b> (+)
               If set, the <b>ls-F</b> builtin command shows the type of file to which each symbolic link points.

       <b>listmax</b> (+)
               The maximum number of items which the <b>list-choices</b> editor command will list without asking first.

       <b>listmaxrows</b> (+)
               The maximum number of rows of items which the  <b>list-choices</b>  editor  command  will  list  without
               asking first.

       <b>loginsh</b> (+)
               Set  by  the shell if it is a login shell.  Setting or unsetting it within a shell has no effect.
               See also <b>shlvl</b>.

       <b>logout</b> (+)
               Set by the shell to ‘normal’ before a normal logout, ‘automatic’ before an automatic logout,  and
               ‘hangup’  if  the  shell  was  killed  by  a hangup signal (see “Signal handling”).  See also the
               <b>autologout</b> shell variable.

       <b>mail</b>    A list of files and directories to check for incoming mail,  optionally  preceded  by  a  numeric
               word.   Before each prompt, if 10 minutes have passed since the last check, the shell checks each
               file and displays
                     <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>new</b> <b>mail.</b>
               (or, if <b>mail</b> contains multiple files,
                     <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>new</b> <b>mail</b> <b>in</b> <u>name</u>.)
               if the filesize is greater than zero in size and has a modification time greater than its  access
               time.

               If  you are in a login shell, then no mail file is reported unless it has been modified after the
               time the shell has started up, to prevent redundant notifications.  Most login programs will tell
               you whether or not you have mail when you log in.

               If a file specified in <b>mail</b> is a directory, the shell will count each file within that  directory
               as a separate message, and will report
                     <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <u>n</u> mails.
               or
                     <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <u>n</u> mails in <u>name</u>.
               as  appropriate.   This functionality is provided primarily for those systems which store mail in
               this manner, such as the Andrew Mail System.

               If the first word of <b>mail</b> is numeric it is taken  as  a  different  mail  checking  interval,  in
               seconds.

               Under very rare circumstances, the shell may report
                     <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>mail.</b>
               instead of
                     <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>new</b> <b>mail.</b>

       <b>matchbeep</b> (+)
               If set to ‘never’, completion never beeps.

               If set to ‘nomatch’, it beeps only when there is no match.

               If set to ‘ambiguous’, it beeps when there are multiple matches.

               If set to ‘notunique’, it beeps when there is one exact and other longer matches.

               If unset, ‘ambiguous’ is used.

       <b>nobeep</b> (+)
               If set, beeping is completely disabled.  See also <b>visiblebell</b>.

       <b>noclobber</b>
               If  set,  restrictions are placed on output redirection to insure that files are not accidentally
               destroyed and that ‘&gt;&gt;’ redirections refer to existing files, as described in the  “Input/output”
               section.

               If contains ‘ask’, an interacive confirmation is presented, rather than an error.

               If contains ‘notempty’, ‘&gt;’ is allowed on empty files.

       <b>noding</b>  If set, disable the printing of
                     <b>DING!</b>
               in the <b>prompt</b> time specifiers at the change of hour.

       <b>noglob</b>  If  set,  “Filename  substitution” and “Directory stack substitution (+)” are inhibited.  This is
               most useful in shell scripts which do not deal with filenames, or after a list of  filenames  has
               been obtained and further expansions are not desirable.

       <b>nokanji</b> (+)
               If  set and the shell supports Kanji (see the <b>version</b> shell variable), it is disabled so that the
               meta key can be used.

       <b>nonomatch</b>
               If set, a “Filename substitution” or “Directory stack substitution (+)” which does not match  any
               existing  files  is  left  untouched  rather than causing an error.  It is still an error for the
               substitution to be malformed.  For example,
                     <b>echo</b> <b>[</b>
               still gives an error.

       <b>nostat</b> (+)
               A list of directories (or glob-patterns which match  directories;  see  “Filename  substitution”)
               that  should  not  be  <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2)ed  during a completion operation.  This is usually used to exclude
               directories which take too much time to <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2), for example <u>/afs</u>.

       <b>notify</b>  If set, the shell announces job completions  asynchronously.   The  default  is  to  present  job
               completions just before printing a prompt.

       <b>oid</b> (+)
               The user's real organization ID.  (Domain/OS only)

       <b>owd</b> (+)
               The  old  working  directory,  equivalent  to the ‘-’ used by <b>cd</b> and <b>pushd</b>.  See also the <b>cwd</b> and
               <b>dirstack</b> shell variables.

       <b>padhour</b>
               If set, enable the printing of padding  '0'  for  hours,  in  24  and  12  hour  formats.   E.g.,
               ‘07:45:42’ versus ‘7:45:42’.

       <b>parseoctal</b>
               To  retain  compatibily with older versions numeric variables starting with 0 are not interpreted
               as octal.  Setting this variable enables proper octal parsing.

       <b>path</b>    A list of directories in which to look for executable commands.

               A null word specifies the current directory.

               If there is no <b>path</b> variable then only full path names will execute.

               <b>path</b> is set by the shell at startup from the PATH environment  variable  or,  if  PATH  does  not
               exist, to a system-dependent default, such as
                     <b>(<a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></b> <b>/usr/bsd</b> <b><a href="file:/bin">/bin</a></b> <b><a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a></b> <b>.)</b>

               The shell may put ‘.’ first or last in <b>path</b> or omit it entirely depending on how it was compiled;
               see the <b>version</b> shell variable.

               A shell which is given neither the <b>-c</b> nor the <b>-t</b> option hashes the contents of the directories in
               <b>path</b> after reading <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u> and each time <b>path</b> is reset.

               If  one adds a new command to a directory in <b>path</b> while the shell is active, one may need to do a
               <b>rehash</b> for the shell to find it.

       <b>printexitvalue</b> (+)
               If set and an interactive program exits with a non-zero status, the shell prints
                     <b>Exit</b> <u>status</u>

       <b>prompt</b>  The string which is printed before reading each command from the terminal.

               <b>prompt</b> may include any of the following formatting sequences (+), which are replaced by the given
               information:

                     <b>Format</b>  <b>Prompt</b> <b>information</b>

                     <b>%/</b>      The current working directory.

                     <b>%~</b>      The current working directory, but with one's home directory represented by ‘~’ and
                             other  users'  home  directories  represented   by   ‘~<u>user</u>’   as   per   “Filename
                             substitution”.   ‘~<u>user</u>’  substitution  happens  only if the shell has already used
                             ‘~<u>user</u>’ in a pathname in the current session.

                     <b>%c[[0]</b><u>n</u><b>]</b>, <b>%.[[0]</b><u>n</u><b>]</b>
                             The trailing component of the current working directory, or <u>n</u>  trailing  components
                             if  a  digit  <u>n</u>  is  given.  If <u>n</u> begins with ‘0’, the number of skipped components
                             precede the trailing component(s)  in  the  format  ‘/&lt;<u>skipped</u><b>&gt;trailing</b>’.   If  the
                             <b>ellipsis</b>  shell  variable is set, skipped components are represented by an ellipsis
                             so the whole becomes ‘...trailing’.  ‘~’ substitution is done as in ‘%~’ above, but
                             the ‘~’ component is ignored when counting trailing components.

                     <b>%C</b>      Like ‘%c’, but without ‘~’ substitution.

                     <b>%h</b>, <b>%!</b>, <b>!</b>
                             The current history event number.

                     <b>%M</b>      The full hostname.

                     <b>%m</b>      The hostname up to the first ‘.’.

                     <b>%S</b> (<b>%s</b>)
                             Start (stop) standout mode.

                     <b>%B</b> (<b>%b</b>)
                             Start (stop) boldfacing mode.

                     <b>%U</b> <b>(%u)</b>
                             Start (stop) underline mode.

                     <b>%t</b>, <b>%@</b>  The time of day in 12-hour AM/PM format.

                     <b>%T</b>      Like ‘%t’, but in 24-hour format (but see the <b>ampm</b> shell variable).

                     <b>%p</b>      The ‘precise’ time of day in 12-hour AM/PM format, with seconds.

                     <b>%P</b>      Like ‘%p’, but in 24-hour format (but see the <b>ampm</b> shell variable).

                     <b>\</b><u>c</u>      <u>c</u> is parsed as in <b>bindkey</b>.

                     <b>^</b><u>c</u>      <u>c</u> is parsed as in <b>bindkey</b>.

                     <b>%%</b>      A single ‘%’.

                     <b>%n</b>      The user name.

                     <b>%N</b>      The effective user name.

                     <b>%j</b>      The number of jobs.

                     <b>%d</b>      The weekday in ‘Day’ format.

                     <b>%D</b>      The day in ‘dd’ format.

                     <b>%w</b>      The month in ‘Mon’ format.

                     <b>%W</b>      The month in ‘mm’ format.

                     <b>%y</b>      The year in ‘yy’ format.

                     <b>%Y</b>      The year in ‘yyyy’ format.

                     <b>%l</b>      The shell's tty.

                     <b>%L</b>      Clears from the end of the prompt to end of the display or the end of the line.

                     <b>%$</b>      Expands the shell or environment variable name immediately after the ‘$’.

                     <b>%#</b>      ‘&gt;’ (or the first character of the <b>promptchars</b> shell variable)  for  normal  users,
                             ‘#’ (or the second character of <b>promptchars</b>) for the superuser.

                     <b>%{</b><u>string</u><b>%}</b>
                             Includes  <b>string</b>  as  a  literal escape sequence.  It should be used only to change
                             terminal attributes and should not move the cursor location.  This  cannot  be  the
                             last sequence in <b>prompt</b>.

                     <b>%?</b>      The return code of the command executed just before the prompt.

                     <b>%R</b>      In  <b>prompt2</b>,  the  status  of  the  parser.   In <b>prompt3</b>, the corrected string.  In
                             <b>history</b>, the history string.

               ‘%B’, ‘%S’, ‘%U’, and ‘%{<u>string</u><b>%}</b>’ are available in only eight-bit-clean shells; see the  <b>version</b>
               shell variable.

               The  bold, standout and underline sequences are often used to distinguish a superuser shell.  For
               example,

                     <b>&gt;</b> <b>set</b> <b>prompt</b> <b>=</b> <b>"%m</b> <b>[%h]</b> <b>%B[%@]%b</b> <b>[%/]</b> <b>you</b> <b>rang?</b> <b>"</b>
                     <b>tut</b> <b>[37]</b> <b>[2:54pm]</b> <b>[/usr/accts/sys]</b> <b>you</b> <b>rang?</b> <b>_</b>

               If ‘%t’, ‘%@’, ‘%T’, ‘%p’, or ‘%P’ is used, and <b>noding</b> is not set, then print
                     <b>DING!</b>
               on the change of hour (i.e, ‘:00’ minutes) instead of the actual time.

               Set by default to ‘<b>%#</b> ’ in interactive shells.

       <b>prompt2</b> (+)
               The string with which to prompt in <b>while</b> and <b>foreach</b> loops and after lines ending  in  ‘\’.   The
               same format sequences may be used as in <b>prompt</b>; note the variable meaning of ‘%R’.

               Set by default to ‘<b>%R?</b> ’ in interactive shells.

       <b>prompt3</b> (+)
               The  string  with which to prompt when confirming automatic spelling correction.  The same format
               sequences may be used as in <b>prompt</b>; note the variable meaning of ‘%R’.

               Set by default to ‘<b>CORRECT&gt;%R</b> <b>(y|n|e|a)?</b> ’ in interactive shells.

       <b>promptchars</b> (+)
               If set (to a two-character string), the ‘%#’ formatting sequence in the <b>prompt</b> shell variable  is
               replaced with the first character for normal users and the second character for the superuser.

       <b>pushdtohome</b> (+)
               If set, <b>pushd</b> without arguments does
                     <b>pushd</b> <b>~</b>
               like <b>cd</b>.

       <b>pushdsilent</b> (+)
               If set, <b>pushd</b> and <b>popd</b> do not print the directory stack.

       <b>recexact</b> (+)
               If set, completion completes on an exact match even if a longer match is possible.

       <b>recognize_only_executables</b> (+)
               If set, command listing displays only files in the path that are executable.  Slow.

       <b>rmstar</b> (+)
               If set, the user is prompted before
                     <b>rm</b> <b>*</b>
               is executed.

       <b>rprompt</b> (+)
               The  string  to  print  on  the  right-hand side of the screen (after the command input) when the
               prompt is being displayed on the left.  It recognizes the same formatting characters  as  <b>prompt</b>.
               It  will  automatically  disappear  and reappear as necessary, to ensure that command input isn't
               obscured, and will appear only if the prompt, command input, and itself will fit together on  the
               first line.

               If <b>edit</b> isn't set, then <b>rprompt</b> will be printed after the prompt and before the command input.

       <b>savedirs</b> (+)
               If set, the shell does
                     <b>dirs</b> <b>-S</b>
               before exiting.

               If the first word is set to a number, at most that many directory stack entries are saved.

       <b>savehist</b>
               If set, the shell does
                     <b>history</b> <b>-S</b>
               before exiting.

               If  the  first word is set to a number, at most that many lines are saved.  (The number should be
               less than or equal to the number <b>history</b> entries; if it is set to  greater  than  the  number  of
               <b>history</b> settings, only <b>history</b> entries will be saved.)

               If  the  second word is set to ‘merge’, the history list is merged with the existing history file
               instead of replacing it (if there is one) and sorted by time stamp and the most recent events are
               retained.

               If the second word is set to ‘merge’ and the third word is set to ‘lock’, the history file update
               will be serialized with other shell sessions that would possibly like to merge history at exactly
               the same time. (+)

       <b>sched</b> (+)
               The  format  in  which  the  <b>sched</b>  builtin  command  prints  scheduled  events;  if  not  given,
               ‘<b>%h\t%T\t%R\n</b>’ is used.  The format sequences are described above under <b>prompt</b>; note the variable
               meaning of ‘%R’.

       <b>shell</b>   The  file  in  which  the shell resides.  This is used in forking shells to interpret files which
               have execute bits set, but which are not executable by  the  system.   (See  the  description  of
               “Builtin  and non-builtin command execution”.)  Initialized to the (system-dependent) home of the
               shell.

       <b>shlvl</b> (+)
               The number of nested shells.  Reset to 1 in login shells.  See also <b>loginsh</b>.

       <b>status</b>  The exit status from the last command or backquote expansion, or any command  in  a  pipeline  is
               propagated  to  <b>status</b>.  (This is also the default <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) behavior.)  This default does not match
               what POSIX mandates (to return the status of the last command only). To match the POSIX behavior,
               you need to unset <b>anyerror</b>.

               If the <b>anyerror</b> variable is unset, the exit status of a pipeline is determined only from the last
               command in the pipeline, and the exit status of  a  backquote  expansion  is  <u>not</u>  propagated  to
               <b>status</b>.

               If  a  command  terminated  abnormally, then 0200 is added to the status.  Builtin commands which
               fail return exit status ‘1’, all other builtin commands return status ‘0’.

       <b>symlinks</b> (+)
               Can be set to several different values to control symbolic link (‘symlink’) resolution:

               If set to ‘chase’, whenever the current directory changes to a directory  containing  a  symbolic
               link,  it  is expanded to the real name of the directory to which the link points.  This does not
               work for the user's home directory; this is a bug.

               If set to ‘ignore’, the shell tries to construct a current  directory  relative  to  the  current
               directory before the link was crossed.  This means that
                     <b>cd</b>
               through a symbolic link and then
                     <b>cd</b> <b>..</b>
               returns  one  to  the  original  directory.   This  affects  only  builtin  commands and filename
               completion.

               If set to ‘expand’, the shell tries to fix symbolic links by actually expanding  arguments  which
               look like path names.  This affects any command, not just builtins.  Unfortunately, this does not
               work  for  hard-to-recognize filenames, such as those embedded in command options.  Expansion may
               be prevented by quoting.  While this setting is usually the  most  convenient,  it  is  sometimes
               misleading  and  sometimes  confusing  when  it  fails  to  recognize an argument which should be
               expanded.  A compromise is to use ‘ignore’ and use the editor command  <b>normalize-path</b>  (bound  by
               default to <b>^X-n</b>) when necessary.

               Some examples are in order.  First, let's set up some play directories:

                     &gt; cd <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>
                     &gt; mkdir from from/src to
                     &gt; ln -s from/src to/dst

               Here's the behavior with <b>symlinks</b> unset,

                     &gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd
                     /tmp/to/dst
                     &gt; cd ..; echo $cwd
                     /tmp/from

               Here's the behavior with <b>symlinks</b> set to ‘chase’,

                     &gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd
                     /tmp/from/src
                     &gt; cd ..; echo $cwd
                     /tmp/from

               Here's the behavior with <b>symlinks</b> set to ‘ignore’,

                     &gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd
                     /tmp/to/dst
                     &gt; cd ..; echo $cwd
                     /tmp/to

               Here's the behavior with <b>symlinks</b> set to ‘expand’.

                     &gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd
                     /tmp/to/dst
                     &gt; cd ..; echo $cwd
                     /tmp/to
                     &gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd
                     /tmp/to/dst
                     &gt; cd ".."; echo $cwd
                     /tmp/from
                     &gt; <a href="file:/bin/echo">/bin/echo</a> ..
                     /tmp/to
                     &gt; <a href="file:/bin/echo">/bin/echo</a> ".."
                     ..

               Note that ‘expand’ expansion:
                     1.   Works just like ‘ignore’ for builtins like <b>cd</b>.
                     2.   Is prevented by quoting.
                     3.   Happens before filenames are passed to non-builtin commands.

       <b>tcsh</b> (+)
               The  version  number of the shell in the format ‘<u>R</u>.<u>VV</u>.<u>PP</u>’, where ‘<u>R</u>’ is the major release number,
               ‘<u>VV</u>’ the current version, and ‘<u>PP</u>’ the patchlevel.

       <b>term</b>    The terminal type.  Usually set in <u><a href="file:~/.login">~/.login</a></u> as described under “Startup and shutdown”.

       <b>time</b>    If set to a number, then the <b>time</b> builtin executes automatically after each command  which  takes
               more than that many CPU seconds.

               If there is a second word, it is used as a format string for the output of the <b>time</b> builtin.

               (u) The following sequences may be used in the <b>time</b> format string:

                     <b>Format</b>  <b>Time</b> <b>information</b>

                     <b>%U</b>      The time the process spent in user mode in cpu seconds.

                     <b>%S</b>      The time the process spent in kernel mode in cpu seconds.

                     <b>%E</b>      The elapsed (wall clock) time in seconds.

                     <b>%P</b>      The CPU percentage computed as (%U + %S) / %E.

                     <b>%W</b>      Number of times the process was swapped.

                     <b>%X</b>      The average amount in (shared) text space used in Kbytes.

                     <b>%K</b>      The total space used (%X + %D) in Kbytes.

                     <b>%M</b>      The maximum memory the process had in use at any time in Kbytes.

                     <b>%F</b>      The number of major page faults (page needed to be brought from disk).

                     <b>%R</b>      The number of minor page faults.

                     <b>%I</b>      The number of input operations.

                     <b>%O</b>      The number of output operations.

                     <b>%r</b>      The number of socket messages received.

                     <b>%s</b>      The number of socket messages sent.

                     <b>%k</b>      The number of signals received.

                     <b>%w</b>      The number of voluntary context switches (waits).

                     <b>%c</b>      The number of involuntary context switches.

               Only the first four sequences are supported on systems without BSD resource limit functions.  The
               default  time format is ‘<b>%Uu</b> <b>%Ss</b> <b>%E</b> <b>%P</b> <b>%X+%Dk</b> <b>%I+%Oio</b> <b>%Fpf+%Ww</b>’ for systems that support resource
               usage reporting and ‘<b>%Uu</b> <b>%Ss</b> <b>%E</b> <b>%P</b>’ for systems that do not.

               Under Sequent's DYNIX/ptx, ‘%X’, ‘%D’, ‘%K’, ‘%r’, and ‘%s’ are not available, but the  following
               additional sequences are:

                     <b>Format</b>  <b>Description</b> <b>Sequent</b> <b>DYNIX/ptx</b> <b>time</b> <b>information</b>

                     <b>%l</b>      The number of read system calls performed.

                     <b>%m</b>      The number of write system calls performed.

                     <b>%p</b>      The number of reads from raw disk devices.

                     <b>%q</b>      The number of writes to raw disk devices.

               and the default time format is ‘<b>%Uu</b> <b>%Ss</b> <b>%E</b> <b>%P</b> <b>%I+%Oio</b> <b>%Fpf+%Ww</b>’.

               Note that the CPU percentage can be higher than 100% on multi-processors.

       <b>tperiod</b> (+)
               The period, in minutes, between executions of the <b>periodic</b> special alias.

       <b>tty</b> (+)
               The name of the tty, or empty if not attached to one.

       <b>uid</b> (+)
               The user's real user ID.

       <b>user</b>    The user's login name.

       <b>verbose</b>
               If set, causes the words of each command to be printed, after history substitution (if any).  Set
               by the <b>-v</b> command line option.

       <b>version</b> (+)
               The  version  ID stamp.  It contains the shell's version number (see <b>tcsh</b>), origin, release date,
               vendor, operating system and machine (see VENDOR, OSTYPE, and  MACHTYPE)  and  a  comma-separated
               list  of  options  which  were  set  at  compile  time.   Options which are set by default in the
               distribution are noted.

               Supported <b>version</b> options include:

                     <b>Option</b>  <b>Description</b>

                     <b>8b</b>      The shell is eight bit clean; default.

                     <b>7b</b>      The shell is not eight bit clean.

                     <b>wide</b>    The shell is multi-byte encoding clean (like UTF-8).

                     <b>nls</b>     The system's NLS is used; default for systems with NLS.

                     <b>lf</b>      Login shells execute <u>/etc/csh.login</u> before  instead  of  after  <u>/etc/csh.cshrc</u>  and
                             <u><a href="file:~/.login">~/.login</a></u> before instead of after <u><a href="file:~/.tcshrc">~/.tcshrc</a></u> and <u><a href="file:~/.history">~/.history</a></u>.

                     <b>dl</b>      ‘.’ is put last in <b>path</b> for security; default.

                     <b>nd</b>      ‘.’ is omitted from <b>path</b> for security.

                     <b>vi</b>      <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1)-style editing is the default rather than <u><a href="../man1/emacs.1.html">emacs</a></u>(1)-style.

                     <b>dtr</b>     Login shells drop DTR when exiting.

                     <b>bye</b>     <b>bye</b> is a synonym for <b>logout</b> and <b>log</b> is an alternate name for <b>watchlog</b>.

                     <b>al</b>      <b>autologout</b> is enabled; default.

                     <b>kan</b>     Kanji is used if appropriate according to locale settings, unless the <b>nokanji</b> shell
                             variable is set.

                     <b>sm</b>      The system's <u><a href="../man3/malloc.3.html">malloc</a></u>(3) is used.

                     <b>hb</b>      The
                                   <b>#!</b><u>interpreter</u> <u>arg</u> <b>...</b>
                             convention is emulated when executing shell scripts.

                     <b>ng</b>      The <b>newgrp</b> builtin is available.

                     <b>rh</b>      The shell attempts to set the REMOTEHOST environment variable.

                     <b>afs</b>     The  shell  verifies your password with the kerberos server if local authentication
                             fails.  The <b>afsuser</b> shell variable or the  AFSUSER  environment  variable  override
                             your local username if set.

               An administrator may enter additional strings to indicate differences in the local version.

       <b>vimode</b> (+)
               If  unset,  various  key  bindings change behavior to be more <u><a href="../man1/emacs.1.html">emacs</a></u>(1)-style: word boundaries are
               determined by <b>wordchars</b> versus other characters.

               If set, various key bindings  change  behavior  to  be  more  <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1)-style:  word  boundaries  are
               determined  by  <b>wordchars</b> versus whitespace versus other characters; cursor behavior depends upon
               current vi mode (command, delete, insert, replace).

               This variable is unset by <b>bindkey</b> <b>-e</b> and set by <b>bindkey</b> <b>-v</b>.  <b>vimode</b>  may  be  explicitly  set  or
               unset by the user after those <b>bindkey</b> operations if required.

       <b>visiblebell</b> (+)
               If set, a screen flash is used rather than the audible bell.  See also <b>nobeep</b>.

       <b>watch</b> (+)
               A  list  of user/terminal pairs to watch for logins and logouts.  If either the user is ‘any’ all
               terminals are watched for the given user and vice versa.  Setting <b>watch</b> to
                     <b>(any</b> <b>any)</b>
               watches all users and terminals.  For example,

                     set watch = (george ttyd1 any console $user any)

               reports activity of the user ‘george’ on ‘ttyd1’, any user on the  console,  and  oneself  (or  a
               trespasser) on any terminal.

               Logins  and  logouts  are checked every 10 minutes by default, but the first word of <b>watch</b> can be
               set to a number to check every so many minutes.  For example,

                     set watch = (1 any any)

               reports any login/logout once every minute.  For the impatient, the <b>log</b> builtin command  triggers
               a <b>watch</b> report at any time.  All current logins are reported (as with the <b>log</b> builtin) when <b>watch</b>
               is first set.

               The <b>who</b> shell variable controls the format of <b>watch</b> reports.

       <b>who</b> (+)
               The  format  string  for  <b>watch</b>  messages.   The  following  sequences  are replaced by the given
               information:

                     <b>Format</b>  <b>Who</b> <b>information</b>

                     <b>%n</b>      The name of the user who logged in/out.

                     <b>%a</b>      The observed action, i.e., ‘logged on’, ‘logged off’, or ‘replaced <u>olduser</u> on’.

                     <b>%l</b>      The terminal (tty) on which the user logged in/out.

                     <b>%M</b>      The full hostname of the remote host, or ‘local’ if the login/logout was  from  the
                             local host.

                     <b>%m</b>      The  hostname  of the remote host up to the first ‘.’.  The full name is printed if
                             it is an IP address or an X Window System display.

               ‘%M’ and ‘%m’ are available on only systems that store the remote hostname in <u>/etc/utmp</u>.

               If unset,
                     <b>%n</b> <b>has</b> <b>%a</b> <b>%l</b> <b>from</b> <b>%m.</b>
               is used, or
                     <b>%n</b> <b>has</b> <b>%a</b> <b>%l.</b>

       <b>wordchars</b> (+)
               A list of non-alphanumeric characters to be considered  part  of  a  word  by  the  <b>forward-word</b>,
               <b>backward-word</b>, etc., editor commands.

               If  unset,  the  default  value  is  determined based on the state of <b>vimode</b>: if <b>vimode</b> is unset,
               ‘<b>*?_-.[]~=</b>’ is used as the default; if <b>vimode</b> is set, ‘_’ is used as the default.

       AFSUSER (+)
               Equivalent to the <b>afsuser</b> shell variable.

       CLICOLOR_FORCE
               Color sequences for <b>ls-F</b> are normally disabled if the output is not directed to a terminal.  This
               can be overridden by setting this variable, which also changes the <b>ls-F</b> invocation  of  <u><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></u>(1)  to
               use <b>--color=always</b> instead of <b>--color=auto</b>.

               Note  that  <b>color</b>  must  be  set  for  this  environment  variable  to  be  effective;  by itself
               CLICOLOR_FORCE does not enable color <b>ls-F</b>.

       COMMAND_LINE
               Set by <b>tcsh</b> to the current command line  when  invoking  programs  for  the  <b>complete</b>  <u>list</u>  mode
               ‘`...`’.  See <b>complete</b> in “Builtin commands”.

       COLUMNS
               The number of columns in the terminal.  See “Terminal management (+)”.

       DISPLAY
               Used by X Window System (see <u><a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a></u>(1)).  If set, the shell does not set <b>autologout</b>.

       EDITOR  The  pathname  to  a default editor.  Used by the <b>run-fg-editor</b> editor command if the the <b>editors</b>
               shell variable is unset.  See also the VISUAL environment variable.

       GROUP (+)
               Equivalent to the <b>group</b> shell variable.

       HOME    Equivalent to the <b>home</b> shell variable.

       HOST (+)
               Initialized to the name of the machine on which the  shell  is  running,  as  determined  by  the
               <u><a href="../man2/gethostname.2.html">gethostname</a></u>(2) system call.

       HOSTTYPE (+)
               Initialized  to the type of machine on which the shell is running, as determined at compile time.
               This variable is obsolete and will be removed in a future version.

       HPATH (+)
               A ‘<b>:</b>’-separated list of directories in which  the  <b>run-help</b>  editor  command  looks  for  command
               documentation.

       LANG    Gives the preferred character environment.  See “Native Language System support (+)”.

       LC_CTYPE
               If set, only ctype character handling is changed.  See “Native Language System support (+)”.

       LINES   The number of lines in the terminal.  See “Terminal management (+)”.

       LSCOLORS
               One  of  two  environment  variables  that may be used to define the per-file colors used by <b>ls-F</b>
               (along with LS_COLORS).  This variable is used by some BSD versions of <u><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></u>(1).

               On <b>tcsh</b> startup, LS_COLORS takes priority over LSCOLORS.   If  both  LSCOLORS  or  LS_COLORS  are
               <b>setenv</b>, the most recent <b>setenv</b> is used.  If LSCOLORS is <b>unsetenv</b> while LS_COLORS is still <b>setenv</b>,
               then LS_COLORS is parsed again (with any warnings suppressed) to reapply its settings.

               This  variable  is a 22 character string containing a concatenation of 11 pairs of the format <u>fb</u>,
               where <u>f</u> is the foreground color and <u>b</u> is the background  color.   If  fewer  than  11  pairs  are
               provided, default colors are used for the remaining entries.  If more than 11 pairs are provided,
               the extra values are ignored.

               The  order  of the color attribute pairs to the equivalent LS_COLORS variable, the file type, and
               default color, is as follows:

                     <b>Index</b>    <b>Var</b>    <b>File</b> <b>type.</b> <b>[Default</b> <b>color]</b>
                     1        <b>di</b>     Directory. [Bold blue]
                     2        <b>ln</b>     Symbolic link. [Bold cyan]
                     3        <b>so</b>     Socket. [Bold magenta]
                     4        <b>pi</b>     Named pipe (FIFO). [Yellow (or brown)]
                     5        <b>ex</b>     Executable file. [Bold green]
                     6        <b>bd</b>     Block device. [Bold yellow]
                     7        <b>cd</b>     Character device. [Bold yellow]
                     8        <b>su</b>     Setuid file. [White on red]
                     9        <b>sg</b>     Setgid file. [Black on yellow]
                     10       <b>tw</b>     Sticky and other writable directory. [Black on green]
                     11       <b>ow</b>     Other writable but not sticky directory. [Blue on green]

               The color code designators are as follows:

                     <b>Code</b>  <b>Description</b>
                     <b>a</b>     Black.
                     <b>b</b>     Red.
                     <b>c</b>     Green.
                     <b>d</b>     Yellow (or brown).
                     <b>e</b>     Blue.
                     <b>f</b>     Magenta.
                     <b>g</b>     Cyan.
                     <b>h</b>     Light grey.
                     <b>A</b>     Bold black, usually shows up as dark grey.
                     <b>B</b>     Bold red.
                     <b>C</b>     Bold green.
                     <b>D</b>     Bold yellow.
                     <b>E</b>     Bold blue.
                     <b>F</b>     Bold magenta.
                     <b>G</b>     Bold cyan.
                     <b>H</b>     Bold light grey; looks like bright white.
                     <b>x</b>     Default foreground or background.

               Note that the above are standard ANSI colors.  The actual display may  differ  depending  on  the
               color capabilities of the terminal in use.

               The  default  colors  are  as  per the color variables in LS_COLORS, and are not the same default
               colors as those used by some BSD versions of <u><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></u>(1).

       LS_COLORS
               One of two environment variables that may be used to define the  per-file  colors  used  by  <b>ls-F</b>
               (along  with  LSCOLORS).   This variable is used by the GNU coreutils version of <u><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></u>(1) and may be
               setup by <u><a href="../man1/dircolors.1.html">dircolors</a></u>(1).

               On <b>tcsh</b> startup, LS_COLORS takes priority over LSCOLORS.   If  both  LSCOLORS  or  LS_COLORS  are
               <b>setenv</b>, the most recent <b>setenv</b> is used.  If LS_COLORS is <b>unsetenv</b> while LSCOLORS is still <b>setenv</b>,
               then LSCOLORS is parsed again (with any warnings suppressed) to reapply its settings.

               The format of this variable is reminiscent of the <u><a href="../man5/termcap.5.html">termcap</a></u>(5) file format; a ‘<b>:</b>’-separated list of
               expressions of the form <b>"</b><u>xx</u><b>=</b><u>value</u><b>"</b> or <b>"*</b><u>ext</u><b>=</b><u>value</u><b>"</b>.

               The  first  form  <b>"</b><u>xx</u><b>=</b><u>value</u><b>"</b>, where <b>"</b><u>xx</u><b>"</b> is a two-character variable name, supports the following
               variables, their associated default ISO 6429 color code or escape sequences, and file type:

                     <b>Var</b>    <b>Default</b>    <b>File</b> <b>type.</b> <b>[Default</b> <b>color]</b>
                     <b>no</b>     <b>0</b>          Normal (non-filename) text.
                     <b>fi</b>     <b>0</b>          Regular file.
                     <b>di</b>     <b>01;34</b>      Directory. [Bold blue]
                     <b>ln</b>     <b>01;36</b>      Symbolic link. [Bold cyan]
                     <b>pi</b>     <b>33</b>         Named pipe (FIFO). [Yellow (or brown)]
                     <b>so</b>     <b>01;35</b>      Socket. [Bold magenta]
                     <b>do</b>     <b>01;35</b>      Door. [Bold magenta]
                     <b>bd</b>     <b>01;33</b>      Block device. [Bold yellow]
                     <b>cd</b>     <b>01;33</b>      Character device. [Bold yellow]
                     <b>ex</b>     <b>01;32</b>      Executable file. [Bold green]
                     <b>mi</b>     (none)     Missing file (orphaned symbolic link target). Defaults to <b>fi</b>.
                     <b>or</b>     (none)     Orphaned (broken) symbolic link. Defaults to <b>ln</b>.
                     <b>lc</b>     <b>^[[</b>        Left code.
                     <b>rc</b>     <b>m</b>          Right code.
                     <b>ec</b>     (none)     End code. Replaces <b>lc</b>+<b>no</b>+<b>rc</b>.
                     <b>su</b>     <b>37;41</b>      Setuid file. [White on red]
                     <b>sg</b>     <b>30;43</b>      Setgid file. [Black on yellow]
                     <b>tw</b>     <b>30;42</b>      Sticky and other writable directory. [Black on green]
                     <b>ow</b>     <b>34;42</b>      Other writable but not sticky directory. [Blue on green]
                     <b>st</b>     <b>37;44</b>      Sticky but not other writable directory. [White on blue]
                     <b>mh</b>     (none)     File with multiple hard links.

               You need to include only the variables you want to change from the default.

               The second form <b>"*</b><u>ext</u><b>=</b><u>value</u><b>"</b> colorizes file names based on extension.   For  example,  using  ISO
               6429  codes,  to  color  all C-language source files blue you would specify <b>"*.c=34"</b>.  This would
               color all files ending in ‘.c’ in blue foreground (34) color.

               Control characters can be written either in C-style-escaped notation, or in stty-like ^-notation.
               The C-style notation adds ‘^[’ for Escape, ‘_’ for a normal space character, and ‘?’ for  Delete.
               In  addition,  the  ‘^[’  escape  character can be used to override the default interpretation of
               ‘^[’, ‘^’, ‘:’, and ‘=’.

               Each filename will be output to the terminal as
                     <b>lc</b> <u>color-code</u> <b>rc</b> <u>filename</u> <b>ec</b>

               If the ‘ec’ code is undefined, the sequence
                     <b>lc</b> <b>no</b> <b>rc</b>
               will be used instead.  This is generally more convenient to use, but less general.

               The left code (‘lc’), right code (‘rc’), and end codes (‘ec’) are provided so you don't  have  to
               type common parts over and over again and to support weird terminals; you will generally not need
               to  change  them  at  all  unless your terminal does not use ISO 6429 color codes but a different
               system.

               If your terminal uses ISO 6429 color codes, you can compose the type codes (i.e., all except  the
               ‘lc’,  ‘rc’,  and ‘ec’ codes) from numerical ISO 6429 color codes separated by ‘;’.  For example,
               ‘01;32’ is bright green foreground with default background.

               The most common ISO 6429 color codes are:

                     <b>Color</b>  <b>Description</b>

                     <b>0</b>      To restore default color.
                     <b>1</b>      Bold / brighter colors.
                     <b>4</b>      Underlined text.
                     <b>5</b>      Flashing text.
                     <b>30</b>     Black foreground.
                     <b>31</b>     Red foreground.
                     <b>32</b>     Green foreground.
                     <b>33</b>     Yellow (or brown) foreground.
                     <b>34</b>     Blue foreground.
                     <b>35</b>     Magenta foreground.
                     <b>36</b>     Cyan foreground.
                     <b>37</b>     White (or gray) foreground.
                     <b>40</b>     Black background.
                     <b>41</b>     Red background.
                     <b>42</b>     Green background.
                     <b>43</b>     Yellow (or brown) background.
                     <b>44</b>     Blue background.
                     <b>45</b>     Magenta background.
                     <b>46</b>     Cyan background.
                     <b>47</b>     White (or gray) background.

               Not all ISO 6429 color codes will work on all systems or display devices.

               A few terminal programs do not recognize the  default  end  code  properly.   If  all  text  gets
               colorized  after  you  do a directory listing, try changing the ‘no’ and ‘fi’ codes from 0 to the
               numerical codes for your standard foreground and background colors.

               For symbolic links the ‘ln’ keyword can be set to ‘target’, which makes the file color  the  same
               as the color of the link target.

               ConvexOS, Stellix and Intel use <u>/etc/logout</u>.  NeXTs use <u>/etc/logout.std</u>.

               A/UX, AMIX, Cray and IRIX have no equivalent in <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1), but read this file in <b>tcsh</b> anyway.

               Solaris 2.x does not have it either, but <b>tcsh</b> reads <u>/etc/.logout</u>.  (+)

       <u><a href="file:~/.logout">~/.logout</a></u>
               Read by login shells at logout after <u>/etc/csh.logout</u> or its equivalent.

       <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u>
               Used to interpret shell scripts not starting with a ‘#’.

       <u>/tmp/sh*</u>
               Temporary file for ‘&lt;&lt;’.

       <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u>
               Source of home directories for ‘~name’ substitutions.

       The  order  in  which  startup  files  are read may differ if the shell was so compiled; see “Startup and
       shutdown” and the <b>version</b> shell variable.

</pre><h4><b>NEW</b> <b>FEATURES</b> <b>(+)</b></h4><pre>
       This manual describes <b>tcsh</b> as a single entity, but experienced <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) users  will  want  to  pay  special
       attention to <b>tcsh</b>'s new features.

       A  command-line editor, which supports <u><a href="../man1/emacs.1.html">emacs</a></u>(1)-style or <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1)-style key bindings.  See “The command-line
       editor (+)” and “Editor commands (+)”.

       Programmable, interactive word completion and listing.  See “Completion and listing (+)” and the <b>complete</b>
       and <b>uncomplete</b> builtin commands.

       “Spelling correction (+)” of filenames, commands and variables.

       “Editor commands (+)” which perform other useful functions in the middle  of  typed  commands,  including
       documentation  lookup  (<b>run-help</b>),  quick  editor  restarting  (<b>run-fg-editor</b>),  and  command  resolution
       (<b>which-command</b>).

       An enhanced history mechanism.  Events in the history  list  are  time-stamped.   See  also  the  <b>history</b>
       command  and  its  associated  shell  variables,  the previously undocumented ‘#’ event specifier and new
       modifiers  under  “History  substitution”,  the  <b>down-history</b>,  <b>expand-history</b>,  <b>history-search-backward</b>,

       <b>vi-search-fwd</b>, and <b>up-history</b> editor commands and the <b>histlit</b> shell variable.

       Enhanced directory parsing and directory stack handling.  See the <b>cd</b>, <b>pushd</b>, <b>popd</b>, and <b>dirs</b> commands  and
       their  associated  shell  variables, the description of “Directory stack substitution (+)”, the <b>dirstack</b>,
       <b>owd</b>, and <b>symlinks</b> shell variables and the <b>normalize-command</b> and <b>normalize-path</b> editor commands.

       Negation in glob-patterns.  See “Filename substitution”.

       New “File inquiry operators” and a <b>filetest</b> builtin which uses them.

       A variety of “Automatic, periodic and timed events (+)”  including  scheduled  events,  special  aliases,
       automatic logout and terminal locking, command timing and watching for logins and logouts.

       Support  for  the  Native Language System (see “Native Language System support (+)”), OS variant features
       (see “OS variant support (+)” and the <b>echo_style</b> shell variable) and system-dependent file locations (see
       “FILES”).

       Extensive terminal-management capabilities.  See “Terminal management (+)”.

       New builtin commands including <b>builtins</b>, <b>hup</b>, <b>ls-F</b>, <b>newgrp</b>, <b>printenv</b>, <b>which</b>, and <b>where</b>.

       New variables that make useful information easily available to the shell.  See  the  <b>gid</b>,  <b>loginsh</b>,  <b>oid</b>,
       <b>shlvl</b>, <b>tcsh</b>, <b>tty</b>, <b>uid</b>, and <b>version</b> shell variables and the HOST, REMOTEHOST, VENDOR, OSTYPE, and MACHTYPE
       environment variables.

       A  new syntax for including useful information in the prompt string (see <b>prompt</b>), and special prompts for
       loops and spelling correction (see <b>prompt2</b> and <b>prompt3</b>).

       Read-only variables.  See “Variable substitution”.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>T</b> <b>IN</b> <b>TCSH</b></h4><pre>
       In 1964, DEC produced the PDP-6.  The PDP-10 was a later re-implementation.   It  was  re-christened  the
       DECsystem-10 in 1970 or so when DEC brought out the second model, the KI10.

       TENEX  was  created  at  Bolt,  Beranek  &amp;  Newman  (a Cambridge, Massachusetts think tank) in 1972 as an
       experiment in demand-paged virtual memory operating systems.  They built a new pager for the  DEC  PDP-10
       and created the OS to go with it.  It was extremely successful in academia.

       In  1975,  DEC  brought  out a new model of the PDP-10, the KL10; they intended to have only a version of
       TENEX, which they had licensed from BBN, for the new box.   They  called  their  version  TOPS-20  (their
       capitalization  is  trademarked).   A  lot of TOPS-10 users (`The OPerating System for PDP-10') objected;
       thus DEC found themselves supporting two incompatible systems on the same hardware--but then there were 6
       on the PDP-11!

       TENEX, and TOPS-20 to version 3, had command completion via a user-code-level subroutine  library  called
       ULTCMD.   With  version 3, DEC moved all that capability and more into the monitor (`kernel' for you Unix
       types), accessed by the COMND% JSYS (`Jump to SYStem' instruction, the supervisor call mechanism [are  my
       IBM roots also showing?]).

       The  creator of tcsh was impressed by this feature and several others of TENEX and TOPS-20, and created a
       version of csh which mimicked them.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The system limits argument lists to ARG_MAX characters.

       The number of arguments to a command which involves filename expansion is limited to 1/6th the number  of
       characters allowed in an argument list.

       Command substitutions may substitute no more characters than are allowed in an argument list.

       To detect looping, the shell restricts the number of <b>alias</b> substitutions on a single line to 20.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       When  a suspended command is restarted, the shell prints the directory it started in if this is different
       from the current directory.  This can be misleading (i.e., wrong) as the job may have changed directories
       internally.

       Shell builtin functions are not stoppable/restartable.  Command sequences of the form
             <b>a</b> <b>;</b> <b>b</b> <b>;</b> <b>c</b>
       are also not handled gracefully when stopping is attempted.  If you suspend  ‘b’,  the  shell  will  then
       immediately  execute  ‘c’.   This  is  especially noticeable if this expansion results from an <b>alias</b>.  It
       suffices to place the sequence of commands in ‘()’'s to force it to a subshell, i.e.,
             <b>(</b> <b>a</b> <b>;</b> <b>b</b> <b>;</b> <b>c</b> <b>)</b>

       Control over tty output after processes are started is primitive; perhaps this will  inspire  someone  to
       work  on a good virtual terminal interface.  In a virtual terminal interface much more interesting things
       could be done with output control.

       Alias substitution is most often used to clumsily simulate shell procedures; shell procedures  should  be
       provided rather than aliases.

       Control  structures should be parsed rather than being recognized as built-in commands.  This would allow
       control commands to be placed anywhere, to be combined with  ‘|’,  and  to  be  used  with  ‘&amp;’  and  ‘;’
       metasyntax.

       <b>foreach</b> doesn't ignore here documents when looking for its <b>end</b>.

       It should be possible to use the ‘:’ modifiers on the output of command substitutions.

       The  screen  update  for  lines longer than the screen width is very poor if the terminal cannot move the
       cursor up (i.e., terminal type ‘dumb’).

       HPATH and NOREBIND don't need to be environment variables.

       Glob-patterns which do not use ‘?’, ‘*’, or ‘[]’, or which use ‘{}’ or ‘~’ are not negated correctly.

       The single-command form of <b>if</b> does output redirection even if the expression is false and the command  is
       not executed.

       <b>ls-F</b>  includes  file  identification  characters  when  sorting  filenames  and  does  not handle control
       characters in filenames well.  It cannot be interrupted.

       Command substitution supports multiple commands and conditions, but not cycles or backward <b>goto</b>s.
