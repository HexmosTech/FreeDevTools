       ksh, rksh - KornShell, a standard/restricted command and programming language

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ksh</b> [ <b>±abcefhiklmnprstuvxBCDEGH</b> ] [ <b>±o</b> option ] ... [ <b>-</b> ] [ arg ... ]
       <b>rksh</b> [ <b>±abcefhiklmnpstuvxBCDEGH</b> ] [ <b>±o</b> option ] ... [ <b>-</b> ] [ arg ... ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Ksh</u> is a command and programming language that executes commands read from a terminal or a file.  <u>Rksh</u> is
       a  restricted  version  of  the  command  interpreter <u>ksh</u>; it is used to set up login names and execution
       environments whose capabilities are more controlled than those of the  standard  shell.   See  <u>Invocation</u>
       below for the meaning of arguments to the shell.

   <b>Definitions.</b>
       A <u>metacharacter</u> is one of the following characters:

              <b>;</b>   <b>&amp;</b>   <b>(</b>   <b>)</b>   <b>|</b>   <b>&lt;</b>   <b>&gt;</b>   <b>new-line</b>   <b>space</b>   <b>tab</b>

       A  <u>blank</u>  is  a  <b>tab</b> or a <b>space</b>.  An <u>identifier</u> is a sequence of letters, digits, or underscores starting
       with a letter or underscore.  Identifiers are used as  components  of  <u>variable</u>  names.   A  <u>vname</u>  is  a
       sequence  of one or more identifiers separated by a <b>.</b> and optionally preceded by a <b>.</b>.  Vnames are used as
       function and variable names.  A <u>word</u> is a sequence of <u>characters</u> from the character set  defined  by  the
       current locale, excluding non-quoted <u>metacharacters</u>.

       A  <u>command</u> is a sequence of characters in the syntax of the shell language.  The shell reads each command
       and carries out the desired action either directly or by invoking separate utilities.  A built-in command
       is a command that is carried out by the shell itself without creating a separate process.  Some  commands
       are  built  in  purely for convenience and are not documented here.  Built-ins that cause side effects in
       the shell environment and built-ins that are found before performing a path search (see <u>Execution</u>  below)
       are  documented  here.   For  historical  reasons,  some of these built-ins behave differently than other
       built-ins and are called <u>special</u> <u>built-ins</u>.

   <b>Commands.</b>
       A <u>simple-command</u> is a list of variable assignments (see <u>Variable</u> <u>Assignments</u>  below)  or  a  sequence  of
       <u>blank</u>  separated  words  which may be preceded by a list of variable assignments (see <u>Environment</u> below).
       The first word specifies the name of the  command  to  be  executed.   Except  as  specified  below,  the
       remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command.  The command name is passed as argument 0
       (see  <u><a href="../man2/exec.2.html">exec</a></u>(2)).   The  <u>value</u>  of  a  <u>simple-command</u>  is its exit status; 0-255 if it terminates normally;
       256+<u>signum</u> if it terminates abnormally (the name of the signal corresponding to the exit  status  can  be
       obtained via the <b>-l</b> option of the <b>kill</b> built-in utility).

       A <u>pipeline</u> is a sequence of one or more <u>command</u>s separated by <b>|</b>.  The standard output of each command but
       the  last  is  connected  by  a  <u><a href="../man2/socketpair.2.html">socketpair</a></u>(2)  or  (if the <b>posix</b> shell option is on) by a <u><a href="../man2/pipe.2.html">pipe</a></u>(2) to the
       standard input of the next command.  Each command except the last is run  asynchronously  in  a  subshell
       (see  <u>Subshells</u>  below).   If  the  <b>monitor</b>  or <b>pipefail</b> option is on, or the pipeline is preceded by the
       <u>reserved</u> <u>word</u> <b>time</b>, then the shell waits for  all  component  commands  in  the  pipeline  to  terminate;
       otherwise,  the  shell  only  waits for the last component command.  The exit status of a pipeline is the
       exit status of its last component command, unless the <b>pipefail</b> option is enabled.  Each pipeline  can  be
       preceded  by  the  <u>reserved</u>  <u>word</u> <b>!</b>  which causes the exit status of the pipeline to become 0 if the exit
       status of the last command is non-zero, and 1 if the exit status of the last command is 0.

       A <u>list</u> is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by <b>;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, <b>|&amp;</b>, <b>&amp;&amp;</b>, or <b>||</b>, and optionally terminated
       by <b>;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, or <b>|&amp;</b>.  Of these five symbols, <b>;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, and <b>|&amp;</b> have equal precedence, which is lower than  that  of
       <b>&amp;&amp;</b>  and  <b>||</b>.   The  symbols  <b>&amp;&amp;</b>  and  <b>||</b>  also  have equal precedence.  A semicolon (<b>;</b>) causes sequential
       execution of the preceding pipeline; an ampersand (<b>&amp;</b>) causes  asynchronous  execution  of  the  preceding
       pipeline  (i.e., the shell does <u>not</u> wait for that pipeline to finish).  The symbol <b>|&amp;</b> causes asynchronous
       execution of the preceding pipeline with a two-way pipe established to the  parent  shell;  the  standard
       input  and output of the spawned pipeline can be written to and read from by the parent shell by applying
       the redirection operators <b>&lt;&amp;</b> and <b>&gt;&amp;</b> with arg <b>p</b> to commands  and  by  using  <b>-p</b>  option  of  the  built-in
       commands  <b>read</b> and <b>print</b> described later.  The symbol <b>&amp;&amp;</b> (<b>||</b>) causes the <u>list</u> following it to be executed
       only if the preceding pipeline returns a zero (non-zero) value.  One or more new-lines may  appear  in  a
       <u>list</u>  instead of a semicolon, to delimit a command.  The first <u>item</u>  of the first <u>pipeline</u> of a <u>list</u> that
       is a simple command not beginning with a redirection, and not occurring within  a  <b>while</b>,  <b>until</b>,  or  <b>if</b>
       <u>list</u>,  can  be preceded by a semicolon.  This semicolon is ignored unless the <b>showme</b> option is enabled as
       described with the <b>set</b> built-in below.

       A <u>command</u> is either a <u>simple-command</u> or a <u>compound-command</u>,  which  is  one  of  the  following.   Unless
       otherwise  stated,  the  value  returned  by a command is that of the last <u>simple-command</u> executed in the
       command.

       <b>for</b> <u>vname</u> [ <b>in</b> <u>word</u> ... ] <b>;do</b> <u>list</u> <b>;done</b>
              Each time a <b>for</b> command is executed, <u>vname</u> is set to the next <u>word</u> taken from the  <b>in</b>  <u>word</u>  list.
              If  <b>in</b>  <u>word</u>  ...   is omitted, then the <b>for</b> command executes the <b>do</b> <u>list</u> once for each positional
              parameter that is set starting from <b>1</b> (see <u>Parameter</u> <u>Expansion</u> below).  Execution ends when  there
              are no more words in the list.

       <b>for</b> <b>((</b> [<u>expr1</u>] <b>;</b> [<u>expr2</u>] <b>;</b> [<u>expr3</u>] <b>))</b> <b>;do</b> <u>list</u> <b>;done</b>
              The  arithmetic  expression  <u>expr1</u>  is  evaluated  first  (see  <u>Arithmetic</u> <u>Evaluation</u> below).  The
              arithmetic expression <u>expr2</u> is repeatedly evaluated until it evaluates to zero and when  non-zero,
              <u>list</u>  is  executed  and  the arithmetic expression <u>expr3</u> evaluated.  If any expression is omitted,
              then it behaves as if it evaluated to 1.

       <b>select</b> <u>vname</u> [ <b>in</b> <u>word</u> ... ] <b>;do</b> <u>list</u> <b>;done</b>
              A <b>select</b> command prints on standard error (file descriptor 2) the set of <u>word</u>s, each preceded by a
              number.  If <b>in</b> <u>word</u> ...  is omitted, then the positional  parameters  starting  from  <b>1</b>  are  used
              instead  (see  <u>Parameter</u>  <u>Expansion</u> below).  The <b>PS3</b> prompt is printed and a line is read from the
              standard input.  If this line consists of the number of one of the listed <u>word</u>s, then the value of
              the variable <u>vname</u> is set to the <u>word</u> corresponding to this number.  If this line  is  empty,  the
              selection  list  is  printed again.  Otherwise the value of the variable <u>vname</u> is set to the empty
              string.  The contents of the line read from standard input is saved in the  variable  <b>REPLY</b>.   The
              <u>list</u>  is  executed  for  each selection until a <b>break</b> or <u>end-of-file</u> is encountered.  If the <b>REPLY</b>
              variable is set to the empty string by the execution of <u>list</u>, then the selection list  is  printed
              before displaying the <b>PS3</b> prompt for the next selection.

       <b>case</b> <u>word</u> <b>in</b> [ [<b>(</b>]<u>pattern</u> [ | <u>pattern</u> ] ... <b>)</b> <u>list</u> <b>;;</b> ] ... <b>esac</b>
              A <b>case</b> command executes the <u>list</u> associated with the first <u>pattern</u> that matches <u>word</u>.  The form of
              the  patterns is the same as that used for pathname expansion (see <u>Pathname</u> <u>Expansion</u> below).  The
              <b>;;</b> operator causes execution of <b>case</b> to terminate.  If  <b>;&amp;</b>  is  used  in  place  of  <b>;;</b>  the  next
              subsequent list, if any,  is executed.

       <b>if</b> <u>list</u> <b>;then</b> <u>list</u> [ <b>;elif</b> <u>list</u> <b>;then</b> <u>list</u> ] ... [ <b>;else</b> <u>list</u> ] <b>;fi</b>
              The  <u>list</u>  following  <b>if</b> is executed and, if it returns a zero exit status, the <u>list</u> following the
              first <b>then</b> is executed.  Otherwise, the <u>list</u> following <b>elif</b> is executed and, if its value is zero,
              the <u>list</u> following the next <b>then</b> is executed.  Failing each successive <b>elif</b> <u>list</u>, the <b>else</b> <u>list</u> is
              executed.  If the <b>if</b> <u>list</u> has non-zero exit status and there is no <b>else</b> <u>list</u>, then the <b>if</b>  command
              returns a zero exit status.

       <b>while</b> <u>list</u> <b>;do</b> <u>list</u> <b>;done</b>
       <b>until</b> <u>list</u> <b>;do</b> <u>list</u> <b>;done</b>
              A  <b>while</b> command repeatedly executes the <b>while</b> <u>list</u> and, if the exit status of the last command in
              the list is zero, executes the <b>do</b> <u>list</u>; otherwise the loop terminates.  If no commands in  the  <b>do</b>
              <u>list</u>  are  executed, then the <b>while</b> command returns a zero exit status; <b>until</b> may be used in place
              of <b>while</b> to negate the loop termination test.

       <b>while</b> <u>inputredirection</u> <b>;do</b> <u>list</u> <b>;done</b>
              Filescan loop. This is defined by a lone  input  redirection  following  <b>while</b>  (see  <u>Input/Output</u>
              below).   It  is  faster  than using the <b>read</b> built-in command in a regular <b>while</b> loop.  The shell
              reads lines from the file or stream opened by <u>inputredirection</u> until the end  is  reached  or  the
              loop  is  broken.   For  each  line  read,  the  command <u>list</u> is executed with the line's contents
              assigned to the <b>REPLY</b> variable and the line's fields split into  the  positional  parameters  (see
              <u>Field</u>  <u>Splitting</u>  and <u>Positional</u> <u>Parameters</u> below).  Within the <u>list</u>, standard input is redirected
              to <b>/dev/null</b>.  If the <b>posix</b> compatibility shell option is on,  this  loop  type  is  disabled  and
              <u>inputredirection</u> is processed like a lone redirection in any other context.

       <b>((</b><u>expression</u><b>))</b>
              The  <u>expression</u>  is  evaluated  using the rules for arithmetic evaluation described below.  If the
              value of the arithmetic expression is non-zero, the exit status is 0, otherwise the exit status is
              1.

       <b>(</b><u>list</u><b>)</b>
              Execute <u>list</u> in a subshell (see <u>Subshells</u> below).  Note, that if two adjacent open parentheses are
              needed for nesting, a space must be inserted to avoid  evaluation  as  an  arithmetic  command  as
              described above.

       <b>{</b> <u>list</u><b>;}</b>
              <u>list</u>  is simply executed.  Note that unlike the metacharacters <b>(</b> and <b>)</b>, <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> are <u>reserved</u> <u>word</u>s
              and must occur at the beginning of a line or after a <b>;</b> in order to be recognized.

       <b>[[</b> <u>expression</u> <b>]]</b>
              Evaluates <u>expression</u> and returns a zero exit status when  <u>expression</u>  is  true.   See  <u>Conditional</u>
              <u>Expressions</u> below, for a description of <u>expression</u>.

       <b>function</b> <u>varname</u> <b>{</b> <u>list</u> <b>;}</b> [ <u>redirection</u> ... ]
       <u>varname</u> <b>()</b> <u>compound-command</u> [ <u>redirection</u> ... ]
              Define  a  function  which  is  referenced  by <u>varname</u>.  A function whose <u>varname</u> contains a <b>.</b>  is
              called a discipline function and the portion of the <u>varname</u> preceding the last <b>.</b>  must refer to an
              existing variable.  The body of the function is the <u>list</u> of commands between <b>{</b> and <b>}</b>.  A  function
              defined  with the <b>function</b> <u>varname</u> syntax can also be used as an argument to the <b>.</b>  special built-
              in command to get the equivalent behavior as if the <u>varname</u><b>()</b> syntax were used to define it.  (See
              <u>Functions</u> below.)

       <b>namespace</b> <u>identifier</u> <b>{</b> <u>list</u> <b>;}</b>
              Defines or uses the name space <u>identifier</u> and runs the commands in <u>list</u> in this name space.   (See
              <u>Name</u> <u>Spaces</u> below.)

       <b>time</b> [ <u>pipeline</u> ]
              If  <u>pipeline</u>  is  omitted  the  user  and  system  time  for the current shell and completed child
              processes is printed on standard error.  Otherwise, <u>pipeline</u> is executed and the elapsed  time  as
              well  as  the  user and system time are printed on standard error.  The <b>TIMEFORMAT</b> variable may be
              set to a format string that specifies how the timing information should be displayed.   See  <b>Shell</b>
              <b>Variables</b> below for a description of the <b>TIMEFORMAT</b> variable.

       The  following  reserved  words are recognized as reserved only when they are the first word of a command
       and are not quoted:

       <b>if</b> <b>then</b> <b>else</b> <b>elif</b> <b>fi</b> <b>case</b> <b>esac</b> <b>for</b> <b>while</b> <b>until</b> <b>do</b> <b>done</b> <b>{</b> <b>}</b> <b>function</b> <b>select</b> <b>time</b> <b>[[</b> <b>]]</b> <b>!</b>

   <b>Variable</b> <b>Assignments.</b>
       One or more variable assignments can start a simple command or can be arguments  to  the  <b>typeset</b>,  <b>enum</b>,
       <b>export</b>,  or <b>readonly</b> special built-in commands as well as to other declaration commands created as types.
       The syntax for an <u>assignment</u> is of the form:

       <u>varname</u><b>=</b><u>word</u>
       <u>varname</u><b>[</b><u>word</u><b>]</b>=<u>word</u>
              No space is permitted between <u>varname</u> and the <b>=</b> or between <b>=</b> and <u>word</u>.

       <u>varname</u><b>=(</b><u>assign_list</u><b>)</b>
              No space is permitted between <u>varname</u> and the  <b>=</b>.   The  variable  <u>varname</u>  is  unset  before  the
              assignment.  An <u>assign_list</u> can be one of the following:
                      <u>word</u> ...
                             Indexed array assignment.
                      <b>[</b><u>word</u><b>]=</b><u>word</u> ...
                             Associative  array  assignment.   If  preceded  by  <b>typeset</b>  <b>-a</b> this will create an
                             indexed array instead.
                      <u>assignment</u> ...
                             Compound variable assignment.   This  creates  a  compound  variable  <u>varname</u>  with
                             subvariables  of  the  form  <u>varname</u><b>.</b><u>name</u>,  where  <u>name</u>  is  the  name  portion  of
                             <u>assignment</u>.  The value  of  <u>varname</u>  will  contain  all  the  assignment  elements.
                             Additional  assignments  made  to subvariables of <u>varname</u> will also be displayed as
                             part of the value of <u>varname</u>.  If no <u>assignment</u>s are specified, <u>varname</u> will  be  a
                             compound variable allowing subsequence child elements to be defined.
                      <b>typeset</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>assignment</u> ...
                             Nested  variable  assignment.   Multiple assignments can be specified by separating
                             each of them with a <b>;</b>.  The previous value is unset before the  assignment.   Other
                             declaration  commands such as <b>readonly,</b> <b>enum</b>, and other declaration commands can be
                             used in place of <b>typeset</b>.
                      <b>.</b> <u>filename</u>
                             Include the assignment commands contained in <u>filename</u>.

       In addition, a <b>+=</b> can be used in place of the <b>=</b> to signify adding to or appending to the previous  value.
       When  <b>+=</b> is applied to an arithmetic type, <u>word</u> is evaluated as an arithmetic expression and added to the
       current value.  When applied to a string variable, the value defined by <u>word</u> is appended  to  the  value.
       For  compound assignments, the previous value is not unset and the new values are appended to the current
       ones provided that the types are compatible.

       The right hand side of a variable assignment  undergoes  all  the  expansion  listed  below  except  word
       splitting,  brace  expansion,  and  pathname  expansion.   When  the left hand side is an assignment is a
       compound variable and the right hand is the name of a compound variable, the  compound  variable  on  the
       right will be copied or appended to the compound variable on the left.

   <b>Comments.</b>
       A word beginning with <b>#</b> causes that word and all the following characters up to a new-line to be ignored.

   <b>Aliasing.</b>
       The  first  word  of  each command is replaced by the text of an <b>alias</b> if an <b>alias</b> for this word has been
       defined.  An  <b>alias</b>  name  consists  of  any  number  of  characters  excluding  metacharacters,  quoting
       characters,  file  expansion  characters,  parameter  expansion  and command substitution characters, the
       characters <b>/</b>  and  <b>=</b>.   The  replacement  string  can  contain  any  valid  shell  script  including  the
       metacharacters  listed  above.   The first word of each command in the replaced text, other than any that
       are in the process of being replaced, will be tested for aliases.  If the last  character  of  the  alias
       value  is a <u>blank</u> then the word following the alias will also be checked for alias substitution.  Aliases
       can be used to redefine built-in commands but cannot be used to redefine the reserved words listed above.
       Aliases can be created and listed with the <b>alias</b> command and can be removed with the <b>unalias</b> command.

       <u>Aliasing</u> is performed when scripts are read, not while they are executed.  Therefore,  for  an  alias  to
       take  effect,  the  <b>alias</b>  definition  command has to be executed before the command which references the
       alias is read.

       The following aliases are automatically preset when the shell is invoked as an interactive shell.  Preset
       aliases can be unset or redefined.
                           <b>history=′hist</b> <b>-l′</b>
                           <b>r=′hist</b> <b>-s′</b>

   <b>Tilde</b> <b>Expansion.</b>
       After alias substitution is performed, each word is checked to see if it begins with an unquoted <b>∼</b>.   For
       tilde  expansion,  <u>word</u>  also  refers to the <u>word</u> portion of parameter expansion (see <u>Parameter</u> <u>Expansion</u>
       below).  If a <u>word</u> is preceded by a tilde, then it is checked up to a <b>/</b> to see if it matches a user  name
       in  the  password database (see <u><a href="../man3/getpwname.3.html">getpwname</a></u>(3)).  If a match is found, the <b>∼</b> and the matched login name are
       replaced by the login directory of the matched user.  If no match is found, the  original  text  is  left
       unchanged.   A  <b>∼</b> by itself, or in front of a <b>/</b>, is replaced by <b>$HOME</b>, unless the <b>HOME</b> variable is unset,
       in which case the current user's home directory as configured in the  operating  system  is  used.   A  <b>∼</b>
       followed by a <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> is replaced by <b>$PWD</b> or <b>$OLDPWD</b> respectively.

       In  addition,  when  expanding a variable assignment (see <u>Variable</u> <u>Assignments</u> above), tilde expansion is
       attempted when the value of the assignment begins with a <b>∼</b>, and when a <b>∼</b> appears after a  <b>:</b>.   A  <b>:</b>  also
       terminates a user name following a <b>∼</b>.

       The  tilde  expansion  mechanism  may be extended or modified by defining one of the discipline functions
       <b>.sh.tilde.set</b> or <b>.sh.tilde.get</b> (see <u>Functions</u> and <u>Discipline</u> <u>Functions</u> below).  If  either  exists,  then
       upon  encountering a tilde word to expand, that function is called with the tilde word assigned to either
       <b>.sh.value</b> (for the <b>.sh.tilde.set</b> function) or <b>.sh.tilde</b> (for  the  <b>.sh.tilde.get</b>  function).   Performing
       tilde  expansion  within a discipline function will not recursively call that function, but default tilde
       expansion remains active, so literal tildes should still be quoted where required.  Either  function  may
       assign  a  replacement  string  to <b>.sh.value</b>.  If this value is non-empty and does not start with a <b>∼</b>, it
       replaces the default tilde expansion when the function terminates.  Otherwise,  the  tilde  expansion  is
       left unchanged.

   <b>Subshells.</b>
       A  <u>subshell</u>  is  a  separate  execution  environment  that  is  a complete duplicate of the current shell
       environment, except for two things: all traps are reset to default except  those  for  signals  that  are
       being  ignored,  and  subshells  cannot be interactive (i.e., they have no command prompt).  Changes made
       within a subshell do not affect the parent environment and are lost when the subshell exits.

       Particular care should be taken not to confuse a subshell with a newly invoked shell  that  is  merely  a
       child  process  of  the  current  shell,  and  which  (unlike a subshell) starts from scratch in terms of
       variables and functions and may be interactive.  Beware of shell tutorials on the Internet  that  confuse
       these.

       Subshells  cannot  be created or invoked using any command.  Instead, the following are automatically run
       in a subshell:

               •  any command or group of commands enclosed in parentheses;

               •  command substitutions of the first and third form (see <u>Command</u> <u>Substitution</u> below);

               •  process substitutions (see <u>Process</u> <u>Substitution</u> below);

               •  all elements of a pipeline except the last;

               •  any command executed asynchronously (i.e., in a background process).

       Creating processes is expensive, so as a performance optimization, a subshell of a non-interactive  shell
       may  share  the  process  of  its  parent  environment.  Such  a subshell is known as a virtual subshell.
       Subshells are virtual unless or until something (such as asynchronous execution, or an attempt to  set  a
       process limit using the <b>ulimit</b> built-in command, or other implementation- or system-defined requirements)
       makes  it  necessary  to  <u><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></u>(2)  it  into  a  separate process.  Barring any bugs in the shell, virtual
       subshells should be indistinguishable from real subshells except  by  their  execution  speed  and  their
       process ID.  See the description of the <b>.sh.pid</b> variable below for more information.

   <b>Command</b> <b>Substitution.</b>
       The standard output from a command list enclosed in parentheses preceded by a dollar sign ( <b>$(</b><u>list</u><b>)</b> ), or
       in  a brace group preceded by a dollar sign ( <b>${</b> <u>list</u><b>;}</b> ), or in a pair of grave accents (<b>``</b>) may be used
       as part or all of a word; trailing new-lines are removed.  In the second case, the <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> are treated as
       a reserved words so that <b>{</b> must be followed by a <u>blank</u> and <b>}</b> must appear at the beginning of the line  or
       follow a <b>;</b>.  In the third (obsolete) form, the string between the quotes is processed for special quoting
       characters  before the command is executed (see <u>Quoting</u> below).  The command substitution <b>$(cat</b> <b>file)</b> can
       be replaced by the equivalent but faster <b>$(&lt;file)</b>.  The command substitution <b>$(</b><u>n</u><b>&lt;#)</b> will  expand  to  the
       current  byte  offset  for  file  descriptor <u>n</u>.  Except for the second form, the command list is run in a
       subshell so that no side effects are possible.  For the second form, the final <b>}</b> will be recognized as  a
       reserved word after any token.

   <b>Arithmetic</b> <b>Expansion.</b>
       An  arithmetic  expression enclosed in double parentheses preceded by a dollar sign ( <b>$(())</b> ) is replaced
       by the value of the arithmetic expression within the double parentheses.

   <b>Process</b> <b>Substitution.</b>
       Each command argument of the form <b>&lt;(</b><u>list</u><b>)</b> or <b>&gt;(</b><u>list</u><b>)</b> will run process <u>list</u>  asynchronously  connected  to
       some file in <b><a href="file:/dev/fd">/dev/fd</a></b> if this directory exists, or else a fifo in a temporary directory.  The name of this
       file  will  become the argument to the command.  If the form with <b>&gt;</b> is selected then writing on this file
       will provide input for <u>list</u>.  If <b>&lt;</b> is used, then the file passed as an argument will contain  the  output
       of the <u>list</u> process.  For example,

              <b>paste</b> <b>&lt;(cut</b> <b>-f1</b> <u>file1</u><b>)</b> <b>&lt;(cut</b> <b>-f3</b> <u>file2</u><b>)</b> <b>|</b> <b>tee</b> <b>&gt;(</b><u>process1</u><b>)</b> <b>&gt;(</b><u>process2</u><b>)</b>

       <u>cuts</u>  fields  1 and 3 from the files <u>file1</u> and <u>file2</u> respectively, <u>pastes</u> the results together, and sends
       it to the processes <u>process1</u> and <u>process2</u>, as well as putting it onto the standard output.  Note that the
       file, which is passed as an argument to the command, is  a  UNIX  <u><a href="../man2/pipe.2.html">pipe</a></u>(2)  so  programs  that  expect  to
       <u><a href="../man2/lseek.2.html">lseek</a></u>(2) on the file will not work.

       Process  substitution  of  the form <b>&lt;(</b><u>list</u><b>)</b> can also be used with the <b>&lt;</b> redirection operator which causes
       the output of <u>list</u> to be standard input or the input for whatever file descriptor is specified.

   <b>Parameter</b> <b>Expansion.</b>
       A <u>parameter</u> is a <u>variable</u>, one or more digits, or any of the characters <b>*</b>, <b>@</b>, <b>#</b>,  <b>?</b>,  <b>-</b>,  <b>$</b>,  and  <b>!</b>.   A
       <u>variable</u>  is  denoted  by a <u>vname</u>.  To create a variable whose <u>vname</u> contains a <b>.</b>, a variable whose <u>vname</u>
       consists of everything before the last <b>.</b> must already exist.  A <u>variable</u> has a <u>value</u>  and  zero  or  more
       <u>attributes</u>.   <u>Variables</u>  can  be  assigned  <u>values</u>  and  <u>attributes</u> by using the <b>typeset</b> special built-in
       command.  The attributes supported by the shell are described later with  the  <b>typeset</b>  special  built-in
       command.

       The shell supports both indexed and associative arrays.  An element of an array variable is referenced by
       a  <u>subscript</u>.   A  <u>subscript</u>  for an indexed array is denoted by an <u>arithmetic</u> <u>expression</u> (see <u>Arithmetic</u>
       <u>Evaluation</u> below) between a <b>[</b> and a <b>]</b>.  To assign values to an indexed array, use  <u>vname</u><b>=(</b><u>value</u>  ...<b>)</b>  or
       <b>set</b>  <b>-A</b>  <u>vname</u>   <u>value</u>  ... .  The value of all non-negative subscripts must be in the range of 0 through
       4,194,303.  A negative subscript is treated as an offset from the maximum current index  +1  so  that  -1
       refers  to  the  last  element.   Indexed  arrays can be declared with the <b>-a</b> option to <b>typeset.</b>  Indexed
       arrays need not be declared.  Any reference to a variable with a valid subscript is legal  and  an  array
       will be created if necessary.

       An  associative  array is created with the <b>-A</b> option to <b>typeset.</b>  A <u>subscript</u> for an associative array is
       denoted by a string enclosed between <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>.

       Referencing any array without a subscript is equivalent to referencing the array with subscript 0.

       The <u>value</u> of a <u>variable</u> may be assigned by writing:

              <u>vname</u><b>=</b><u>value</u> [ <u>vname</u><b>=</b><u>value</u> ] ...

       or

              <u>vname</u><b>[</b><u>subscript</u><b>]=</b><u>value</u> [ <u>vname</u><b>[</b><u>subscript</u><b>]=</b><u>value</u> ] ...

       Note that no space is allowed before or after the <b>=</b>.

       Attributes assigned by the <u>typeset</u> special built-in command apply to all elements of the array.  An array
       element can be a simple variable, a compound variable or an array variable.  An  element  of  an  indexed
       array  can  be  either  an indexed array or an associative array.  An element of an associative array can
       also be either.  To refer to an array element that is part of an array element, concatenate the subscript
       in brackets.  For example, to refer to the <u>foobar</u> element of an associative array that is defined as  the
       third element of the indexed array, use <b>${</b><u>vname</u><b>[</b><u>3</u><b>][</b><u>foobar</u><b>]}</b>

       A  <u>nameref</u>  is  a  variable  that  is  a reference to another variable.  A nameref is created with the <b>-n</b>
       attribute of <b>typeset</b> or with the equivalent <b>nameref</b> command.  The value of the variable at  the  time  of
       that  command  becomes  the  variable that will be referenced whenever the nameref variable is used.  The
       name of a nameref cannot contain a <b>.</b>.  When a variable or function name contains a <b>.</b>, and the portion  of
       the  name  up  to  the  first  <b>.</b>  matches  the name of a nameref, the variable referred to is obtained by
       replacing the nameref portion with the name of the variable referenced by the nameref.  If a  nameref  is
       used as the index of a <b>for</b> loop, a name reference is established for each item in the list.

       A nameref provides a convenient way to refer to the variable inside a function whose name is passed as an
       argument  to  a  function.   For  example, if the name of a variable is passed as the first argument to a
       function, the command <b>typeset</b> <b>-n</b> <b>var=$1</b> (a.k.a.  <b>nameref</b> <b>var=$1</b>) inside the  function  causes  references
       and assignments to <b>var</b> to be references and assignments to the variable whose name has been passed to the
       function.  Note that, for this to work, the positional parameter must be assigned directly to the nameref
       as  part  of  the declaration command, as in the example above; only that idiom can allow one function to
       access a local variable of another.  For instance, <b>typeset</b> <b>-n</b> <b>var;</b> <b>var=$1</b> won't cross that  barrier,  nor
       will <b>typeset</b> <b>foo=$1;</b> <b>typeset</b> <b>-n</b> <b>var=foo</b>.

       If  any  of the floating point attributes, <b>-E</b>, <b>-F</b>, or <b>-X</b>, or the integer attribute, <b>-i</b>, is set for <u>vname</u>,
       then the <u>value</u> is subject to arithmetic evaluation as described below.

       Positional parameters, parameters denoted by a number, may be assigned values with the <b>set</b> special built-
       in command.  Parameter <b>$0</b> is set from argument zero when the shell is invoked.

       The character <b>$</b> is used to introduce substitutable <u>parameters</u>.

       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>}</b>
              The shell reads all the characters from <b>${</b> to the matching <b>}</b> as part of the same word even  if  it
              contains  braces  or  metacharacters.   The  value,  if any, of the parameter is substituted.  The
              braces are required when <u>parameter</u> is followed by a letter, digit, or underscore that is not to be
              interpreted as part of its name, when the variable  name  contains  a  <b>.</b>.   The  braces  are  also
              required  when  a  variable  is  subscripted  unless  it  is part of an Arithmetic Expression or a
              Conditional Expression.  If <u>parameter</u> is one or more digits then it is a positional parameter.   A
              positional  parameter  of more than one digit must be enclosed in braces.  If <u>parameter</u> is <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>,
              then all the positional parameters, starting with  <b>$1</b>,  are  substituted  (separated  by  a  field
              separator  character).   If  an  array <u>vname</u> with last subscript <b>*</b> <b>@</b>, or for indexed arrays of the
              form <u>sub1</u> <b>..</b>  <u>sub2</u>.  is used, then the value for each  of  the  elements  between  <u>sub1</u>  and  <u>sub2</u>
              inclusive  (or  all  elements for <b>*</b> and <b>@</b>) is substituted, separated by the first character of the
              value of <b>IFS</b>.

       <b>${#</b><u>parameter</u><b>}</b>
              If <u>parameter</u> is <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>, the number of positional parameters is substituted.  Otherwise, the length
              of the value of the <u>parameter</u> is substituted.

       <b>${#</b><u>vname</u><b>[*]}</b>
       <b>${#</b><u>vname</u><b>[@]}</b>
              The number of elements in the array <u>vname</u> is substituted.

       <b>${@</b><u>vname</u><b>}</b>
              Expands to the type name (see <u>Type</u> <u>Variables</u>  below) or attributes of the variable referred to  by
              <u>vname</u>.

       <b>${!</b><u>vname</u><b>}</b>
              Expands to the name of the variable referred to by <u>vname</u>.  This will be <u>vname</u> except when <u>vname</u> is
              a name reference.

       <b>${!</b><u>vname</u><b>[</b><u>subscript</u><b>]}</b>
              Expands  to  name  of the subscript unless <u>subscript</u> is <b>*</b>, <b>@</b>.  or of the form <u>sub1</u> <b>..</b>  <u>sub2</u>.  When
              <u>subscript</u> is <b>*</b>, the list of array subscripts for <u>vname</u> is generated.  For a variable that  is  not
              an  array,  the  value  is  <u>0</u>  if  the  variable  is set.  Otherwise it is the empty string.  When
              <u>subscript</u> is <b>@</b>, same as above, except that when used in double quotes, each array subscript yields
              a separate argument.  When <u>subscript</u> is of the form <u>sub1</u> <b>..</b>   <u>sub2</u>  it  expands  to  the  list  of
              subscripts between <u>sub1</u> and <u>sub2</u> inclusive using the same quoting rules as <b>@</b>.

       <b>${!</b><u>prefix</u><b>@}</b>
       <b>${!</b><u>prefix</u><b>*}</b>
              These  both  expand  to  the names of the variables whose names begin with <u>prefix</u>.  The expansions
              otherwise work like <b>$@</b> and <b>$*</b>, respectively (see under <u>Quoting</u> below).

       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>:-</b><u>word</u><b>}</b>
              If <u>parameter</u> is set and has a non-empty value, then substitute  its  value;  otherwise  substitute
              <u>word</u>.

       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>:=</b><u>word</u><b>}</b>
              If  <u>parameter</u>  is  not  set  or  has the empty string value, then set it to <u>word</u>; the value of the
              parameter is then substituted.  Positional parameters may not be assigned to in this way.

       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>:?</b><u>word</u><b>}</b>
              If <u>parameter</u> is set and has a non-empty value, then substitute its value;  otherwise,  print  <u>word</u>
              and  exit  from  the  shell  (if  not interactive).  If <u>word</u> is omitted then a standard message is
              printed.

       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>:+</b><u>word</u><b>}</b>
              If <u>parameter</u> is set and has a non-empty value then substitute <u>word</u>; otherwise substitute the empty
              string.

       In the above, <u>word</u> is not evaluated unless it is to be used as the substituted string, so  that,  in  the
       following example, <b>pwd</b> is executed only if <b>d</b> is not set or has the empty string value:

              print ${d:-$(pwd)}

       If  the  colon (<b>:</b>) is omitted from the above expressions, then the shell only checks whether <u>parameter</u> is
       set or not.

       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>:</b><u>offset</u><b>:</b><u>length</u><b>}</b>
       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>:</b><u>offset</u><b>}</b>
              Expands to the portion of the value of <u>parameter</u> starting  at  the  character  (counting  from  <b>0</b>)
              determined  by  expanding  <u>offset</u>  as  an  arithmetic  expression  and consisting of the number of
              characters determined by the arithmetic expression defined by <u>length.</u>  In  the  second  form,  the
              remainder  of the value is used.  If A negative <u>offset</u> counts backwards from the end of <u>parameter</u>.
              Note that one or more <u>blank</u>s is required in front of a  minus  sign  to  prevent  the  shell  from
              interpreting  the  operator as <b>:-</b>.  If <u>parameter</u> is <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>, or is an array name indexed by <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>,
              then <u>offset</u> and <u>length</u> refer to the array index and number of elements respectively.   A  negative
              <u>offset</u>  is taken relative to one greater than the highest subscript for indexed arrays.  The order
              for associative arrays is unspecified.

       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>#</b><u>pattern</u><b>}</b>
       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>##</b><u>pattern</u><b>}</b>
              If the shell <u>pattern</u> matches the beginning of the value of  <u>parameter</u>,  then  the  value  of  this
              expansion  is  the value of the <u>parameter</u> with the matched portion deleted; otherwise the value of
              this <u>parameter</u> is substituted.  In the first form the smallest matching pattern is deleted and  in
              the  second  form  the  largest  matching pattern is deleted.  When <u>parameter</u> is <b>@</b>, <b>*</b>, or an array
              variable with subscript <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the substring operation is applied to each element in turn.

       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>%</b><u>pattern</u><b>}</b>
       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>%%</b><u>pattern</u><b>}</b>
              If the shell <u>pattern</u> matches the end of the value of <u>parameter</u>, then the value of  this  expansion
              is  the  value  of  the <u>parameter</u> with the matched part deleted; otherwise substitute the value of
              <u>parameter</u>.  In the first form the smallest matching pattern is deleted and in the second form  the
              largest  matching pattern is deleted.  When <u>parameter</u> is <b>@</b>, <b>*</b>, or an array variable with subscript
              <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the substring operation is applied to each element in turn.

       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>/</b><u>pattern</u><b>/</b><u>string</u><b>}</b>
       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>//</b><u>pattern</u><b>/</b><u>string</u><b>}</b>
       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>/#</b><u>pattern</u><b>/</b><u>string</u><b>}</b>
       <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>/%</b><u>pattern</u><b>/</b><u>string</u><b>}</b>
              Expands <u>parameter</u> and replaces  the  longest  match  of  <u>pattern</u>  with  the  given  <u>string.</u>   Each
              occurrence  of  <b>\</b><u>n</u>  in  <u>string</u>  is  replaced  by  the  portion  of <u>parameter</u> that matches the <u>n</u>-th
              subpattern.  In the first form, only the first occurrence of <u>pattern</u> is replaced.  In  the  second
              form,  each  match  for  <u>pattern</u>  is  replaced  by the given <u>string.</u>  The third form restricts the
              pattern match to the beginning of the string while the fourth form restricts the pattern match  to
              the  end  of  the  string.  In the first and second forms, an empty <u>pattern</u> never matches.  In the
              third and fourth forms, an empty  <u>pattern</u>  matches  the  beginning  or  the  end  of  the  string,
              respectively.   When <u>string</u> is empty, the <u>pattern</u> will be deleted and the <b>/</b> in front of <u>string</u> may
              be omitted.  When <u>parameter</u> is <b>@</b>, <b>*</b>, or an array variable with subscript <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the  substitution
              operation  is  applied  to each element in turn.  In this case, the <u>string</u> portion of <u>word</u> will be
              re-evaluated for each element.

   <b>Shell</b> <b>Variables.</b>
       The following parameters are automatically set by the shell:
              <b>#</b>      The number of positional parameters in decimal.

              <b>-</b>      Options supplied to the shell on invocation or by the <b>set</b> command.

              <b>?</b>      The exit status returned by the last executed command. Its meaning depends on  the  command
                     or function that defines it, but there are conventions that other commands often depend on:
                     zero typically means 'success' or 'true', one typically means 'non-success' or 'false', and
                     a  value  greater  than  one  typically  indicates  some  kind  of  error. Only the 8 least
                     significant bits of <b>$?</b> (values 0 to 255) are preserved when the exit status is passed on to
                     a parent process, but within the same (sub)shell environment, it is a signed integer  value
                     with  a  range  of  possible  values  as  shown by the commands <b>getconf</b> <b>INT_MIN</b> and <b>getconf</b>
                     <b>INT_MAX</b>. Shell functions that run in the current environment may return  status  values  in
                     this range.

              <b>$</b>      The  process  ID  of  the  main  shell  process.  Note that this value will not change in a
                     subshell, even if the subshell runs in a different process.  See also <b>.sh.pid</b>.

              <b>_</b>      Initially, the value of <b>_</b> is an absolute pathname of the shell or script being executed  as
                     passed  in  the <u>environment</u>.  Subsequently it is assigned the last argument of the previous
                     command.  This parameter is not set for commands which are asynchronous.  This parameter is
                     also used to hold the name of the  matching  <b>MAIL</b>  file  when  checking  for  mail.   While
                     defining  a  compound  variable  or a type, <b>_</b> is initialized as a reference to the compound
                     variable or type.  When a discipline function is invoked, <b>_</b> is initialized as  a  reference
                     to  the  variable associated with the call to this function.  Finally when <b>_</b> is used as the
                     name of the first variable of a type definition, the new type is derived from the  type  of
                     the first variable. (See <u>Type</u> <u>Variables</u>  below.)

              <b>!</b>      The  process  ID  of  the last background command invoked or the most recent job put in the
                     background with the <b>bg</b> built-in command.

              <b>.sh.command</b>
                     When processing a <b>DEBUG</b> trap, this variable contains the current command line that is about
                     to run.  The value is in the same format as the  output  generated  by  the  <b>xtrace</b>  option
                     (minus the preceding <b>PS4</b> prompt).

              <b>.sh.edchar</b>
                     This  variable  contains  the value of the keyboard character (or sequence of characters if
                     the first character is an ESC, ASCII <b>033</b>) that has been entered  when  processing  a  <b>KEYBD</b>
                     trap  (see  <u>Key</u>  <u>Bindings</u> below).  If the value is changed as part of the trap action, then
                     the new value replaces the key (or key sequence) that caused the trap.

              <b>.sh.edcol</b>
                     The character position of the cursor at the time of the most recent <b>KEYBD</b> trap.

              <b>.sh.edmode</b>
                     Upon executing a <b>KEYBD</b> trap action, the value of this variable is set to  the  ESC  control
                     character  if  the  shell is in <b>vi</b> input mode (See <u>Vi</u> <u>Editing</u> <u>Mode</u>  below), or to the empty
                     string value otherwise.

              <b>.sh.edtext</b>
                     The characters in the input buffer at the time of the most recent <b>KEYBD</b> trap.  The variable
                     is unset when not processing a <b>KEYBD</b> trap.

              <b>.sh.file</b>
                     The pathname of the file that contains the current command.

              <b>.sh.fun</b>
                     The name of the current function that is being executed.

              <b>.sh.level</b>
                     Set to the current call depth of functions and dot scripts.   Normally,  this  variable  is
                     read-only, but while executing a <b>DEBUG</b> trap, its value may be changed to switch the current
                     function  scope  to that of the specified level for the duration of the trap run, making it
                     possible to access a parent scope for debugging purposes.  When trap  execution  ends,  the
                     variable  and  the  scope are restored.  It is an error to assign a value lower than 0 (the
                     global scope) or higher than the current call depth.

              <b>.sh.lineno</b>
                     Set during a <b>DEBUG</b> trap to the line number for the caller of each function.

              <b>.sh.match</b>
                     Whenever a match is found in a pattern matching operation  using  either  the  <b>[[</b>  compound
                     command  (see  <u>Conditional</u>  <u>Expressions</u>  below)  or  the  expansions  <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>#</b><u>pattern</u><b>}</b>,
                     <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>%</b><u>pattern</u><b>}</b>, <b>${</b><u>parameter</u><b>/</b><u>pattern</u><b>/</b><u>string</u><b>}</b>, or one of their variants (see  <u>Parameter</u>
                     <u>Expansion</u>  above),  the  match and its subpattern matches are stored in this indexed array,
                     overwriting its previous values.  The <b>0</b>-th element stores the complete match and  the  <u>i</u>-th
                     element  stores  the  <u>i</u>-th  submatch.  For <b>//</b>, the array is two-dimensional, with the first
                     subscript indicating the most recent match and subpattern match, and the  second  subscript
                     indicating  which  match  with  <b>0</b>  representing  the  first  match.   If no match is found,
                     <b>.sh.match</b> is not reset or modified.  Note that even matching operations  performed  on  the
                     <b>.sh.match</b> variable itself will overwrite it upon finding a match.

              <b>.sh.math</b>
                     Used  for  defining  arithmetic  functions (see <u>Arithmetic</u> <u>Evaluation</u> below) and stores the
                     list of user defined arithmetic functions.

              <b>.sh.name</b>
                     Set to the name of the variable at the time that a discipline function is invoked.

              <b>.sh.subscript</b>
                     Set to the name subscript of the variable  at  the  time  that  a  discipline  function  is
                     invoked.

              <b>.sh.subshell</b>
                     The current depth for subshells and command substitution.

              <b>.sh.pid</b>
                     Set  to  the  process  ID  of  the  current shell process.  Unlike <b>$$</b>, this is updated in a
                     subshell when it forks into a new process.  Note that a virtual subshell may have  to  fork
                     mid-execution  due  to  various  system-  and implementation-dependent requirements, so the
                     value should not be counted on to remain the same from one  command  to  the  next.   If  a
                     persistent  process  ID is required for a subshell, it must be ensured it is running in its
                     own process first.  Any attempt to set a process limit using the <b>ulimit</b>  built-in  command,
                     such  as  <b>ulimit</b>  <b>-t</b> <b>unlimited</b> <b>2&gt;/dev/null</b>, is a reliable way to make a subshell fork if it
                     hasn't already.

              <b>.sh.ppid</b>
                     Set to the process ID of the parent of the current shell process.  Unlike  <b>$PPID</b>,  this  is
                     updated  in  a  subshell  when  it  forks into a new process.  The same note as for <b>.sh.pid</b>
                     applies.

              <b>.sh.value</b>
                     Set to the value of the variable at the time that the <b>set</b> or <b>append</b> discipline function  is
                     invoked.   When  a  user  defined arithmetic function is invoked, the value of <b>.sh.value</b> is
                     saved and <b>.sh.value</b> is set to long double precision floating point.  <b>.sh.value</b> is  restored
                     when the function returns.

              <b>.sh.version</b>
                     Set to a value that identifies the version of this shell.

              <b>COLUMNS</b>
                     Width   of   the   terminal  window  in  character  positions.   Updated  automatically  at
                     initialization and on receiving a <b>SIGWINCH</b> signal.  The shell uses the value to define  the
                     width of the edit window for the shell edit modes and for printing <b>select</b> lists.

              <b>KSH_VERSION</b>
                     A name reference to <b>.sh.version</b>.

              <b>LINENO</b> The current line number within the script or function being executed.

              <b>LINES</b>  Height  of  the  terminal  window in lines.  Updated automatically at initialization and on
                     receiving a <b>SIGWINCH</b> signal.  The shell uses the value to determine the column  length  for
                     printing  <b>select</b>  lists:  they are printed vertically until about two thirds of <b>LINES</b> lines
                     are filled.

              <b>OLDPWD</b> The previous working directory set by the <b>cd</b> command.

              <b>OPTARG</b> The value of the last option argument processed by the <b>getopts</b> built-in command.

              <b>OPTIND</b> The index of the last option argument processed by the <b>getopts</b> built-in command.

              <b>PPID</b>   The process ID of the parent of the main shell process.  Note  that  this  value  will  not
                     change in a subshell, even if the subshell runs in a different process.  See also <b>.sh.ppid</b>.

              <b>PWD</b>    The present working directory set by the <b>cd</b> command.

              <b>RANDOM</b> Each  time  this  variable  is  referenced,  a pseudorandom integer is generated, uniformly
                     distributed between 0 and 32767 (the 16-bit unsigned integer range) except  that  the  same
                     number  is  never  repeated  twice  in  a  row.   The  sequence  of pseudorandom numbers is
                     reproducible and can be initialized to a fixed starting point by assigning a  numeric  seed
                     value  to  <b>RANDOM</b>.  Each time a new shell or subshell environment is entered (see <u>Subshells</u>
                     above), the sequence is automatically reset to a different point.

              <b>REPLY</b>  This variable is set by the <b>select</b> statement and by  the  <b>read</b>  built-in  command  when  no
                     arguments are supplied.

              <b>SECONDS</b>
                     Each  time  this  variable  is  referenced, the number of seconds since shell invocation is
                     returned.  If this variable is assigned a value, then the  value  returned  upon  reference
                     will be the value that was assigned plus the number of seconds since the assignment.

              <b>SHLVL</b>  An  integer  variable  that is incremented and exported each time the shell is invoked.  If
                     <b>SHLVL</b> is not in the environment when the shell is invoked, it is set to 1.

       The following variables are used by the shell:
              <b>CDPATH</b> The search path for the <b>cd</b> command.

              <b>EDITOR</b> If the <b>VISUAL</b> variable is not set, the value of this variable will be checked  for  certain
                     patterns  and  the  corresponding editing option will be turned on as described with <b>VISUAL</b>
                     below.

              <b>ENV</b>    If this variable is set, then parameter expansion,  command  substitution,  and  arithmetic
                     expansion  are  performed  on the value to generate the pathname of the script that will be
                     executed when the shell is invoked interactively (see  <u>Invocation</u>  below).   This  file  is
                     typically  used for <b>alias</b> and <b>function</b> definitions.  The default value is <b>$HOME/.kshrc</b>.  On
                     systems that support a system wide  <b>/etc/ksh.kshrc</b> initialization  file,  if  the  filename
                     generated  by  the  expansion of <b>ENV</b> begins with <b><a href="file:/./">/./</a></b> or <b>.<a href="file:/./">/./</a></b> the system wide initialization
                     file will not be executed.

              <b>FCEDIT</b> Obsolete name for the default editor name for the <b>hist</b> command.  <b>FCEDIT</b> is  not  used  when
                     <b>HISTEDIT</b> is set.

              <b>FIGNORE</b>
                     A  pattern  that defines the set of filenames that will be ignored when performing filename
                     matching.

              <b>FPATH</b>  The search path for function definitions.  The directories in this path are searched for  a
                     file with the same name as the function or command when a function with the <b>-u</b> attribute is
                     referenced  and  when  a command is not found.  If an executable file with the name of that
                     command is found, then it is read and executed in the current  environment.   Unlike  <b>PATH</b>,
                     the  current  directory  must  be  represented  explicitly  by <b>.</b>  rather than by adjacent <b>:</b>
                     characters or a beginning or ending <b>:</b>.

              <b>histchars</b>
                     This variable can be used to specify up to three  ASCII  characters  that  control  history
                     expansion  (see  <u>History</u>  <u>Expansion</u>  below).  The first (default: <b>!</b>) signals the start of a
                     history expansion.  The second (default: <b>^</b>) is  used  for  short-form  substitutions.   The
                     third  (default:  <b>#</b>), when found as the first character of a word, causes history expansion
                     to be skipped for the rest of the words on the line.  Multi-byte  characters  (e.g.  UTF-8)
                     are not supported and produce undefined results.

              <b>HISTCMD</b>
                     Number of the current command in the history file.

              <b>HISTEDIT</b>
                     Name for the default editor name for the <b>hist</b> command.

              <b>HISTFILE</b>
                     If  this  variable  is set when the shell is invoked, then the value is the pathname of the
                     file that will be used to store the command history (see <u>Command</u> <u>Re-entry</u> below).

              <b>HISTSIZE</b>
                     If this variable is set when the shell is invoked, then the number  of  previously  entered
                     commands  that  are  accessible by this shell will be greater than or equal to this number.
                     The default is 512.

              <b>HOME</b>   The default argument (home directory) for the <b>cd</b> command.

              <b>IFS</b>    Internal field separators, normally <b>space</b>, <b>tab</b>, and <b>new-line</b> that are used to separate  the
                     results  of  command  substitution  or  parameter expansion and to separate fields with the
                     built-in command <b>read</b>.  The first character  of  the  <b>IFS</b>  variable  is  used  to  separate
                     arguments  for  the  <b>"$*"</b>  expansion (see <u>Quoting</u> below).  Each single occurrence of an <b>IFS</b>
                     character in the string to be split that is not in the <u>isspace</u>  character  class,  and  any
                     adjacent  characters  in <b>IFS</b> that are in the <u>isspace</u> character class, delimit a field.  One
                     or more characters in <b>IFS</b> that belong to the <u>isspace</u> character class delimit a  field.   In
                     addition,  if  the  same  <u>isspace</u>  character appears consecutively inside <b>IFS</b> and the <b>posix</b>
                     shell option is not on, this character is treated as if it were not in the <u>isspace</u> class  -
                     for  example,  if  <b>IFS</b>  consists  of  two  <b>tab</b> characters, then two adjacent <b>tab</b> characters
                     delimit an empty field.

              <b>JOBMAX</b> This variable defines the maximum number running background jobs that can run  at  a  time.
                     When this limit is reached, the shell will wait for a job to complete before starting a new
                     job.

              <b>LANG</b>   This  variable  determines  the  locale category for any category not specifically selected
                     with a variable starting with <b>LC_</b> or <b>LANG</b>.

              <b>LC_ALL</b> This variable overrides the value of the <b>LANG</b> variable and any other <b>LC_</b> variable.

              <b>LC_COLLATE</b>
                     This variable determines the locale category for character collation information.

              <b>LC_CTYPE</b>
                     This variable  determines  the  locale  category  for  character  handling  functions.   It
                     determines the character classes for pattern matching (see <u>Pathname</u> <u>Expansion</u> below).

              <b>LC_NUMERIC</b>
                     This variable determines the locale category for the decimal point character.

              <b>MAIL</b>   If  this  variable  is set to the name of a mail file <u>and</u> the <b>MAILPATH</b> variable is not set,
                     then the shell informs the user of arrival of mail in the specified file.

              <b>MAILCHECK</b>
                     This variable specifies how often (in seconds) the shell will  check  for  changes  in  the
                     modification  time  of  any  of the files specified by the <b>MAILPATH</b> or <b>MAIL</b> variables.  The
                     default value is 600 seconds.  When the time  has  elapsed  the  shell  will  check  before
                     issuing the next prompt.

              <b>MAILPATH</b>
                     A  colon  (  <b>:</b>  )  separated  list  of file names.  If this variable is set, then the shell
                     informs the user of any modifications to the specified files that have occurred within  the
                     last  <b>MAILCHECK</b> seconds.  Each file name can be followed by a <b>?</b>  and a message that will be
                     printed.   The  message  will  undergo  parameter  expansion,  command  substitution,   and
                     arithmetic expansion with the variable <b>$_</b> defined as the name of the file that has changed.
                     The default message is <u>you</u> <u>have</u> <u>mail</u> <u>in</u> <u>$_.</u>

              <b>PATH</b>   The  search  path  for  commands  (see  <u>Execution</u>  below).  The user may not change <b>PATH</b> if
                     executing under <b>rksh</b> (except in <b>.profile).</b>

              <b>PS1</b>    Every time a new command line is started  on  an  interactive  shell,  the  value  of  this
                     variable   is   expanded  to  resolve  backslash  escaping,  parameter  expansion,  command
                     substitution, and arithmetic expansion.  The result defines the primary prompt  string  for
                     that  command  line.  The default is ``<b>$</b> ''.  The character <b>!</b>  in the primary prompt string
                     is replaced by the <u>command</u> number (see <u>Command</u> <u>Re-entry</u> below).  Two successive occurrences
                     of <b>!</b>  will produce a single <b>!</b>  when the prompt string is printed.  Note that  any  terminal
                     escape  sequences  used  in  the  <b>PS1</b>  prompt  thus need every instance of <b>!</b>  in them to be
                     changed to <b>!!</b>.

              <b>PS2</b>    Secondary prompt string, by default ``<b>&gt;</b> ''.

              <b>PS3</b>    Selection prompt string used within a <b>select</b> loop, by default ``<b>#?</b> ''.

              <b>PS4</b>    The value of this variable is expanded for parameter evaluation, command substitution,  and
                     arithmetic  expansion and precedes each line of an execution trace.  By default, <b>PS4</b> is ``<b>+</b>
                     ''.  In addition when <b>PS4</b> is unset, the execution trace prompt is also ``<b>+</b> ''.

              <b>SHELL</b>  The pathname of the <u>shell</u> is kept in the environment.  At invocation, if  the  basename  of
                     this variable is <b>rsh</b>, <b>rksh</b>, or <b>krsh</b>, then the shell becomes restricted.

              <b>TIMEFORMAT</b>
                     The  value  of  this  parameter  is  used  as  a  format  string  specifying how the timing
                     information for pipelines prefixed with the <b>time</b> reserved word should be displayed.  The  <b>%</b>
                     character  introduces  a  format  sequence  that  is  expanded  to  a  time  value or other
                     information.  The format sequences and their meanings are as follows.
                     <b>%%</b>        A literal <b>%</b>.
                     <b>%[</b><u>p</u><b>][l]R</b>  The elapsed time in seconds.
                     <b>%[</b><u>p</u><b>][l]U</b>  The number of CPU seconds spent in user mode.
                     <b>%[</b><u>p</u><b>][l]S</b>  The number of CPU seconds spent in system mode.
                     <b>%P</b>        The CPU percentage, computed as (U + S) / R.

                     The brackets denote optional portions.  The optional <u>p</u> is a digit specifying the <u>precision</u>,
                     the number of fractional digits after a decimal point.  A value  of  0  causes  no  decimal
                     point  or  fraction  to  be  output.   At  most three places after the decimal point can be
                     displayed; values of <u>p</u> greater than 3 are treated as 3.  If <u>p</u> is not specified, the value 3
                     is used.

                     The optional <b>l</b> specifies a longer format, including hours if greater  than  zero,  minutes,
                     and  seconds  of  the  form  <u>HH</u>h<u>MM</u>m<u>SS</u>.<u>FF</u>s.   The  value  of <u>p</u> determines whether or not the
                     fraction is included.  Seconds are zero-padded unless the <b>posix</b> shell option is on.

                     All other characters are output without change and a trailing newline  is  added.   If  the
                     variable  is unset, the default value, <b>$'\nreal\t%2lR\nuser\t%2lU\nsys\t%2lS'</b>, is used.  If
                     the value is empty, no timing information is displayed.

              <b>TMOUT</b>  Terminal read timeout. If set to a value greater than zero, the <b>read</b> built-in  command  and
                     the <b>select</b> compound command time out after <b>TMOUT</b> seconds when input is from a terminal.  An
                     interactive  shell  will  issue  a  warning  and allow for an extra 60 second timeout grace
                     period before terminating if a line is not entered within the prescribed number of  seconds
                     while  reading  from a terminal.  (Note that the shell can be compiled with a maximum bound
                     for this value which cannot be exceeded.)

              <b>VISUAL</b> The value of this variable is scanned when the shell is invoked and whenever its  value  is
                     changed;  if  it is found to match certain patterns, the corresponding line editor (see <u>In-</u>
                     <u>line</u> <u>Editing</u> <u>Options</u> below) is activated.  If it matches the  pattern  <u>*[Vv][Ii]*</u>,  the  <b>vi</b>
                     option is turned on; else if it matches the pattern <u>*gmacs*</u>, the <b>gmacs</b> option is turned on;
                     else  if  it  matches  the  pattern  <u>*macs*</u>, the <b>emacs</b> option is turned on.  If none of the
                     patterns match, <b>emacs</b> is turned on by default upon initializing an interactive  shell.   If
                     the  value is changed by assignment and none of the patterns match, no options are changed.
                     The value of <b>VISUAL</b> overrides the value of <b>EDITOR.</b>

       The shell gives default values to <b>PATH</b>, <b>PS1</b>, <b>PS2</b>, <b>PS3</b>, <b>PS4</b>, <b>MAILCHECK</b>, <b>FCEDIT</b>, <b>TMOUT</b> and <b>IFS</b>, while <b>HOME</b>,
       <b>SHELL</b>, <b>ENV</b>, <b>histchars</b>, and <b>MAIL</b> are not set at all by the shell (although <b>HOME</b> <u>is</u> set by  <u><a href="../man1/login.1.html">login</a></u>(1)).   On
       some systems <b>MAIL</b> and <b>SHELL</b> are also set by <u><a href="../man1/login.1.html">login</a></u>(1).

   <b>Field</b> <b>Splitting.</b>
       After  parameter  expansion  and  command  substitution, the results of substitutions are scanned for the
       field separator characters (those found in <b>IFS</b>) and split into distinct fields where such characters  are
       found.   Explicit  empty  fields  (<b>""</b>  or  <b>′′</b>) are retained.  Implicit empty fields (those resulting from
       <u>parameters</u> that are unset or have empty string values or from command substitutions  yielding  the  empty
       string, and that are not quoted with <b>""</b>) are removed.

   <b>Brace</b> <b>Expansion.</b>
       If  the  <b>braceexpand</b>  (<b>-B</b>)  option  is  set  then  each  <u>word</u>, as well as any fields resulting from <u>field</u>
       <u>splitting</u> (see above), are checked to see if they contain one  or  more  of  the  brace  patterns  <b>{*,*}</b>,
       <b>{</b><u>l1</u><b>..</b><u>l2</u><b>}</b>,  <b>{</b><u>n1</u><b>..</b><u>n2</u><b>}</b>,  <b>{</b><u>n1</u><b>..</b><u>n2</u><b>%</b><u>fmt</u><b>}</b>,  <b>{</b><u>n1</u><b>..</b><u>n2</u><b>..</b><u>n3</u><b>}</b>, or <b>{</b><u>n1</u><b>..</b><u>n2</u><b>..</b><u>n3</u><b>%</b><u>fmt</u><b>}</b>, where <b>*</b> represents any character,
       <u>l1</u>,<u>l2</u> are letters and <u>n1</u>,<u>n2</u>,<u>n3</u> are signed numbers and <u>fmt</u> is a format specified as used  by  <b>printf</b>.   In
       each  case,  fields  are  created  by prepending the characters before the <b>{</b> and appending the characters
       after the <b>}</b> to each of the strings generated by the characters between the <b>{</b> and <b>}</b>.  The resulting fields
       are checked to see if they have any brace patterns.

       In the first form, a field is created for each string between <b>{</b> and <b>,</b>, between <b>,</b> and <b>,</b>, and between <b>,</b> and
       <b>}</b>.  The string represented by <b>*</b> can contain embedded matching <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> without quoting.  Otherwise, each <b>{</b>
       and <b>}</b> with <b>*</b> must be quoted.

       In the second form, <u>l1</u> and <u>l2</u> must both be either upper case or both be lower case characters  in  the  C
       locale.  In this case a field is created for each character from <u>l1</u> through <u>l2</u>.

       In the remaining forms, a field is created for each number starting at <u>n1</u> and continuing until it reaches
       <u>n2</u>  incrementing  <u>n1</u>  by  <u>n3</u>.   The  values of <u>n1</u>, <u>n2</u> and <u>n3</u> are limited to the standard integer range as
       output by <b>getconf</b> <b>INT_MIN</b> and <b>getconf</b> <b>INT_MAX</b>; the behavior is undefined if this range is exceeded.   The
       cases  where  <u>n3</u>  is  not  specified  behave as if <u>n3</u> where <b>1</b> if <u>n1</u><b>&lt;=</b><u>n2</u> and <b>-1</b> otherwise.  If forms which
       specify <b>%</b><u>fmt</u> any format flags, widths and precisions can be specified and <u>fmt</u>  can  end  in  any  of  the
       specifiers <b>cdiouxX</b>.  For example, <b>{a,z}{1..5..3%02d}{b..c}x</b> expands to the 8 fields, <b>a01bx</b>, <b>a01cx</b>, <b>a04bx</b>,
       <b>a04cx</b>, <b>z01bx</b>, <b>z01cx</b>, <b>z04bx</b> and <b>z04cx</b>.

   <b>Pathname</b> <b>Expansion.</b>
       This  is  also known as <u>globbing</u> or sometimes <u>filename</u> <u>generation</u>.  Pathname expansion is disabled if the
       <b>-f</b> a.k.a.  <b>--noglob</b> shell option is on.  Otherwise, if certain special characters are found in a <u>word</u>  or
       in  a  field resulting from <u>field</u> <u>splitting</u> (see above), then the word or field is regarded as a <u>pattern</u>.
       Each literal <u>word</u> is scanned for the characters <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>[</b>, and <b>(</b>, but fields resulting from <u>field</u> <u>splitting</u>
       are scanned only for the characters <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>, and <b>[</b> for compatibility reasons (in which case the <b>(</b>  character
       is not special and any pattern syntax described below that involves parentheses does not apply).

       Each   file   name   component   that  contains  a  recognized  pattern  character  is  replaced  with  a
       lexicographically sorted set of names that matches the pattern from that directory.  If no file  name  is
       found  that matches the pattern, then that component of the filename is left unchanged unless the pattern
       is prefixed with <b>∼(N)</b>, in which case it is removed as described below.  The  special  traversal  names  <b>.</b>
       and  <b>..</b>   are  never  matched.  If <b>FIGNORE</b> is set, then each file name component that matches the pattern
       defined by the value of <b>FIGNORE</b> is ignored when generating the matching filenames.   If  <b>FIGNORE</b>  is  not
       set, the character <b>.</b>  at the start of each file name component will be ignored unless the first character
       of  the  pattern  corresponding  to  this  component  is the character <b>.</b>  itself.  Note that, for uses of
       pattern matching other than pathname expansion, the <b>/</b> and <b>.</b>  are not treated specially.

              <b>*</b>      Matches any string, including the empty string.  When used for filename expansion,  if  the
                     <b>globstar</b> option is on, an isolated pattern of two adjacent <b>*</b>s will match all files and zero
                     or  more  directories  and  subdirectories.   If  followed by a <b>/</b> then only directories and
                     subdirectories will match.
              <b>?</b>      Matches any single character.
              <b>[</b>...<b>]</b>  Matches any one of the enclosed characters.  A pair of characters separated  by  <b>-</b>  matches
                     any  character lexically between the pair, inclusive.  If the first character following the
                     opening <b>[</b> is a <b>!</b>  or <b>^</b>, then any character not enclosed is matched.  A <b>-</b> can be included in
                     the character set by putting it as the first or last character.
                     Within <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>, character classes can be specified with the syntax <b>[:</b><u>class</u><b>:]</b>,  where  <u>class</u>
                     is  one  of  the  following  classes  defined  in  the  ANSI  C standard (note that <b>word</b> is
                     equivalent to <b>alnum</b> plus the character <b>_</b>):
                     <b>alnum</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>blank</b> <b>cntrl</b> <b>digit</b> <b>graph</b> <b>lower</b> <b>print</b> <b>punct</b> <b>space</b> <b>upper</b> <b>word</b> <b>xdigit</b>
                     Within <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>, an equivalence class can be specified with the syntax <b>[=</b><u>c</u><b>=]</b>  which  matches
                     all characters with the same primary collation weight (as defined by the current locale) as
                     the character <u>c</u>.  Within <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>, <b>[.</b><u>symbol</u><b>.]</b>  matches the collating symbol <u>symbol</u>.

       A  <u>pattern-list</u> is a list of one or more patterns separated from each other with a <b>&amp;</b> or <b>|</b>.  A <b>&amp;</b> signifies
       that all patterns must be matched whereas <b>|</b>  requires  that  only  one  pattern  be  matched.   Composite
       patterns can be formed with one or more of the following subpatterns:
              <b>?(</b><u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Optionally matches any one of the given patterns.
              <b>*(</b><u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns.
              <b>+(</b><u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns.
              <b>{</b><u>n</u><b>}</b>(<u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Matches <u>n</u> occurrences of the given patterns.
              <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>,</b><u>n</u><b>}</b>(<u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Matches  from  <u>m</u>  to <u>n</u> occurrences of the given patterns.  If <u>m</u> is omitted, <b>0</b> will be used.
                     If <u>n</u> is omitted, at least <u>m</u> occurrences will be matched.
              <b>@(</b><u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Matches exactly one of the given patterns.
              <b>!(</b><u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>
                     Matches anything except one of the given patterns.

       By default, each pattern or subpattern will match the longest string possible consistent with  generating
       the longest overall match.  If more than one match is possible, the one starting closest to the beginning
       of  the string will be chosen.   However, for each of the above compound patterns, a <b>-</b> can be inserted in
       front of the <b>(</b> to cause the shortest match to the specified <u>pattern-list</u> to be used.

       When <u>pattern-list</u> is contained within parentheses, the backslash character <b>\</b> is  treated  specially  even
       when  inside  a  character  class.    All ANSI C character escapes are recognized and match the specified
       character.  In addition, the following escape sequences are recognized:
              <b>\d</b>     Matches any character in the <b>digit</b> class.
              <b>\D</b>     Matches any character not in the <b>digit</b> class.
              <b>\s</b>     Matches any character in the <b>space</b> class.
              <b>\S</b>     Matches any character not in the <b>space</b> class.
              <b>\w</b>     Matches any character in the <b>word</b> class.
              <b>\W</b>     Matches any character not in the <b>word</b> class.

       A pattern of the form <b>%(</b><u>pattern-pair</u>(s)<b>)</b> is a subpattern that can  be  used  to  match  nested  character
       expressions.   Each  <u>pattern-pair</u>  is  a  two-character  sequence  that cannot contain <b>&amp;</b> or <b>|</b>.  The first
       <u>pattern-pair</u> specifies the starting and ending characters for the match.   Each  subsequent  <u>pattern-pair</u>
       represents  the beginning and ending characters of a nested group that will be skipped over when counting
       starting and ending character matches.  The behavior  is  unspecified  when  the  first  character  of  a
       <u>pattern-pair</u> is alphanumeric, except for the following:
              <b>D</b>      Causes  the  ending  character  to  terminate the search for this pattern without finding a
                     match.
              <b>E</b>      Causes the ending character to be interpreted as an escape character.
              <b>L</b>      Causes the ending character to be interpreted as a quote character, causing all  characters
                     to be ignored when looking for a match.
              <b>Q</b>      Causes  the ending character to be interpreted as a quote character, causing all characters
                     other than any escape character to be ignored when looking for a match.

       Thus, <b>%({}Q"E\)</b>, matches characters starting at <b>{</b> until the matching <b>}</b> is found, not counting any <b>{</b> or  <b>}</b>
       that  is  inside  a  double-quoted  string  or  preceded by the escape character <b>\</b>.  Without the <b>{}</b>, this
       pattern matches any C language string.

       Each subpattern in a composite pattern is numbered, starting at 1, by the location of the  <b>(</b>  within  the
       pattern.   The  sequence <b>\</b><u>n</u>, where <u>n</u> is a single digit and <b>\</b><u>n</u> comes after the <u>n</u>th subpattern, matches the
       same string as the subpattern itself.

       Finally, a pattern can contain subpatterns of the form <b>∼(</b><u>options</u><b>:</b><u>pattern-list</u><b>)</b>, where either  <u>options</u>  or
       <b>:</b><u>pattern-list</u>  can  be omitted.  Unlike the other compound patterns, these subpatterns are not counted in
       the numbered subpatterns.  <b>:</b><u>pattern-list</u> must be omitted for options <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>V</b>, and <b>X</b>  below.   If
       <u>options</u> is present, it can consist of one or more of the following:
              <b>+</b>      Enable the following options.  This is the default.
              <b>-</b>      Disable the following options.
              <b>E</b>      The  remainder of the pattern uses extended regular expression syntax like the <b>-E</b> option of
                     the <u><a href="../man1/grep.1.html">grep</a></u>(1) command.
              <b>F</b>      The remainder of the pattern uses the fixed pattern syntax of the <b>-F</b> option of the  <u><a href="../man1/grep.1.html">grep</a></u>(1)
                     command.
              <b>G</b>      The  remainder of the pattern uses basic regular expression syntax like the <u><a href="../man1/grep.1.html">grep</a></u>(1) command
                     without options.
              <b>K</b>      The remainder of the pattern uses shell pattern syntax.  This is the default.
              <b>N</b>      When it is the first letter and is used with pathname expansion, and no matches occur,  the
                     file pattern expands to the empty string instead of remaining unexpanded.  Otherwise, it is
                     ignored.
              <b>X</b>      The remainder of the pattern uses augmented regular expression syntax like the <b>-X</b> option of
                     the AT&amp;T AST version of the <u><a href="../man1/grep.1.html">grep</a></u>(1) command.
              <b>P</b>      The  remainder of the pattern uses <u><a href="../man1/perl.1.html">perl</a></u>(1) regular expression syntax.  Not all perl regular
                     expression syntax is currently implemented.
              <b>V</b>      The remainder of the pattern uses System V regular expression syntax.
              <b>i</b>      Always treat the match as case-insensitive, regardless of the <b>globcasedetect</b> shell option.
              <b>g</b>      File the longest match (greedy).  This is the default.
              <b>l</b>      Left-anchor the pattern.  This is the default for <b>K</b> style patterns.
              <b>r</b>      Right-anchor the pattern.  This is the default for <b>K</b> style patterns.

       If both <u>options</u>  and  <b>:</b><u>pattern-list</u>  are  specified,  then  the  options  apply  only  to   <u>pattern-list</u>.
       Otherwise, these options remain in effect until they are disabled by a subsequent <b>∼(</b><u>...</u><b>)</b> or at the end of
       the subpattern containing <b>∼(</b><u>...</u><b>)</b>.

   <b>Quoting.</b>
       Each  of the <u>metacharacters</u> listed earlier (see <u>Definitions</u> above) has a special meaning to the shell and
       causes termination of a word unless quoted.  A character may be <u>quoted</u> (i.e., made to stand  for  itself)
       by  preceding  it  with  a  <b>\</b>.  The pair <b>\new-line</b> is removed.  All characters enclosed between a pair of
       single quote marks (<b>′′</b>) that is not preceded by a <b>$</b> are quoted.  A single quote cannot appear within  the
       single  quotes.  A single quoted string preceded by an unquoted <b>$</b> is processed as a C99 string except for
       the following:
              <b>\0</b>     Causes the remainder of the string to be ignored.
              <b>\E</b>     Equivalent to the escape character (ASCII <b>033</b>),
              <b>\e</b>     Equivalent to the escape character (ASCII <b>033</b>),
              <b>\c</b><u>x</u>    Expands to the character control-<u>x</u>.
              <b>\C[.</b><u>name</u><b>.]</b>
                     Expands to the collating element <u>name</u>.

       Inside double quote marks (<b>""</b>), parameter and command substitution occur and <b>\</b> quotes the  characters  <b>\</b>,
       <b>`</b>,  <b>"</b>,  and  <b>$</b>.  A <b>$</b> in front of a double quoted string will be ignored in the "C" or "POSIX" locale, and
       may cause the string to be replaced by a locale specific string otherwise.  The meaning of <b>$*</b> and  <b>$@</b>  is
       identical  when  not quoted or when used as a variable assignment value or as a file name.  However, when
       used as a command argument, <b>"$*"</b> is equivalent to <b>"$1</b><u>d</u><b>$2</b><u>d</u>...<b>"</b>, where <u>d</u> is the first character of the  <b>IFS</b>
       variable,  whereas  <b>"$@"</b>  is  equivalent  to  <b>"$1"</b> <b>"$2"</b> ....  Inside grave quote marks (<b>``</b>), <b>\</b> quotes the
       characters <b>\</b>, <b>`</b>, and <b>$</b>.  If the grave quotes occur within double quotes, then <b>\</b> also quotes the character
       <b>"</b>.

       The special meaning of reserved words or aliases can be removed by quoting any character of the  reserved
       word.   The  recognition  of  function  names or built-in command names listed below cannot be altered by
       quoting them.

   <b>Arithmetic</b> <b>Evaluation.</b>
       The shell performs arithmetic evaluation for arithmetic expansion, to evaluate an arithmetic command,  to
       evaluate  an indexed array subscript, and to evaluate arguments to the built-in commands <b>shift</b> and <b>let</b> as
       well as arguments to numeric format specifiers given to <b>print</b> <b>-f</b>  and <b>printf</b>.  Evaluations are  performed
       using double precision floating point arithmetic or long double precision floating point for systems that
       provide  this  data type.  Floating point constants follow the ANSI C programming language floating point
       conventions.  The case-insensitive floating point constants <b>NaN</b> and <b>Inf</b> can be used to represent  "not  a
       number"  and  infinity  respectively,  unless the <b>posix</b> shell option is on.  Integer constants follow the
       ANSI C programming language integer constant conventions although only single  byte  character  constants
       are recognized and character casts are not recognized.

       In addition, integer constants can be of the form <u>base</u><b>#</b><u>n</u> or (for negative numbers) <b>-</b><u>base</u><b>#</b><u>n</u>, where <u>base</u> is
       a  decimal  number  between  two  and  sixty-four  representing the arithmetic base, and <u>n</u> is an unsigned
       integer in that base.  The digits above 9 are represented by the  lower  case  letters,  the  upper  case
       letters, <b>@</b>, and <b>_</b>, respectively.  For bases less than or equal to 36, upper and lower case letters can be
       used interchangeably.

       An  arithmetic  expression  uses  the  same  syntax, precedence, and associativity of expression as the C
       language.  All the C language operators that  apply  to  floating  point  quantities  can  be  used.   In
       addition,  the  operator <b>**</b> can be used for exponentiation.  It has higher precedence than multiplication
       and is left associative.  In addition, when the value of an arithmetic variable or subexpression  can  be
       represented  as a long integer, all C language integer arithmetic operations can be performed.  Variables
       can be referenced by name within an arithmetic expression without using the parameter  expansion  syntax.
       When a variable is referenced, its value is evaluated as an arithmetic expression.

       Any  of  the  following  math  library  functions  that  are  in the C math library can be used within an
       arithmetic expression:

       <b>abs</b> <b>acos</b> <b>acosh</b> <b>asin</b> <b>asinh</b> <b>atan</b> <b>atan2</b> <b>atanh</b> <b>cbrt</b> <b>ceil</b> <b>copysign</b> <b>cos</b> <b>cosh</b> <b>erf</b> <b>erfc</b> <b>exp</b> <b>exp10</b> <b>exp2</b> <b>expm1</b> <b>fabs</b>
       <b>fdim</b> <b>finite</b> <b>float</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fma</b> <b>fmax</b>  <b>fmin</b>  <b>fmod</b>  <b>fpclass</b>  <b>fpclassify</b>  <b>hypot</b>  <b>ilogb</b>  <b>int</b>  <b>isfinite</b>  <b>isgreater</b>
       <b>isgreaterequal</b>  <b>isinf</b>  <b>isinfinite</b> <b>isless</b> <b>islessequal</b> <b>islessgreater</b> <b>isnan</b> <b>isnormal</b> <b>issubnormal</b> <b>isunordered</b>
       <b>iszero</b> <b>j0</b> <b>j1</b> <b>jn</b> <b>ldexp</b> <b>lgamma</b> <b>log</b> <b>log10</b> <b>log1p</b> <b>log2</b> <b>logb</b> <b>nearbyint</b> <b>nextafter</b> <b>nexttoward</b> <b>pow</b> <b>remainder</b>  <b>rint</b>
       <b>round</b> <b>scalb</b> <b>scalbn</b> <b>signbit</b> <b>sin</b> <b>sinh</b> <b>sqrt</b> <b>tan</b> <b>tanh</b> <b>tgamma</b> <b>trunc</b> <b>y0</b> <b>y1</b> <b>yn</b>

       In  addition,  arithmetic functions can be defined as shell functions with a variant of the <b>function</b> <u>name</u>
       syntax,

       <b>function</b> <b>.sh.math.</b><u>name</u> <u>ident</u> ... <b>{</b> <u>list</u> <b>;}</b>
              where <u>name</u> is the function name used in the arithmetic expression and each identifier, <u>ident</u> is  a
              name  reference to the long double precision floating point argument.  The value of <b>.sh.value</b> when
              the function returns is the value of this function.  User defined  functions  can  take  up  to  3
              arguments and override C math library functions.

       An  internal  representation of a <u>variable</u> as a double precision floating point can be specified with the
       <b>-E</b> [<u>n</u>], <b>-F</b> [<u>n</u>], or <b>-X</b> [<u>n</u>] option of the <b>typeset</b> special built-in  command.   The  <b>-E</b>  option  causes  the
       expansion  of  the  value  to be represented using scientific notation when it is expanded.  The optional
       option argument <u>n</u> defines the number of significant figures.  The <b>-F</b> option causes the  expansion  to  be
       represented  as  a floating decimal number when it is expanded.  The <b>-X</b> option causes the expansion to be
       represented using the <b>%a</b> format defined by ISO C-99.  The optional option argument <u>n</u> defines  the  number
       of places after the decimal (or radix) point in this case.

       An  internal  integer representation of a <u>variable</u> can be specified with the <b>-i</b> [<u>n</u>] option of the <b>typeset</b>
       special built-in command.  The optional option argument <u>n</u> specifies an arithmetic base to  be  used  when
       expanding the variable.  If you do not specify an arithmetic base, base 10 will be used.

       Arithmetic  evaluation is performed on the value of each assignment to a variable with the <b>-E</b>, <b>-F</b>, <b>-X</b>, or
       <b>-i</b> attribute.  Assigning a floating point number to a variable  whose  type  is  an  integer  causes  the
       fractional part to be truncated.

   <b>Prompting.</b>
       When  used  interactively,  the  shell  prompts  with  the  value of <b>PS1</b> after expanding it for parameter
       expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion, before reading a command.  In  addition,  each
       single  <b>!</b>  in the prompt is replaced by the command number.  A <b>!!</b>  is required to place <b>!</b>  in the prompt.
       If at any time a new-line is typed and further input is needed to complete a command, then the  secondary
       prompt (i.e., the value of <b>PS2</b>) is issued.

   <b>Conditional</b> <b>Expressions.</b>
       A  <u>conditional</u> <u>expression</u> is used with the <b>[[</b> compound command to test attributes of files and to compare
       strings.  Field splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the words between <b>[[</b> and <b>]]</b>.   Each
       expression can be constructed from one or more of the following unary or binary expressions:
              <u>string</u> Same as <b>-n</b> <u>string</u> below.
              <b>-a</b> <u>file</u>

                     True  if  <u>file</u>  exists  and  is  executable  by  current  process.  If <u>file</u> exists and is a

                     True if <u>file</u> exists and the modification time is greater than the last access time.
              <b>-O</b> <u>file</u>
                     True if <u>file</u> exists and is owned by the effective user ID of this process.
              <b>-G</b> <u>file</u>
                     True if <u>file</u> exists and its group matches the effective group ID of this process.
              <b>-R</b> <u>name</u>
                     True if variable <u>name</u> is a name reference.

                     True if <u>file2</u> exists and <u>file1</u> does not, or <u>file1</u> is older than <u>file2</u>.

                     True if <u>file1</u> and <u>file2</u> exist and refer to the same file.
              <u>string</u> <b>==</b> <u>pattern</u>
                     True if <u>string</u> matches <u>pattern</u>.  Any part of <u>pattern</u> can  be  quoted  to  cause  it  to  be
                     matched  as  a  string.  With a successful match to a pattern, the <b>.sh.match</b> array variable
                     will contain the match and subpattern matches.
              <u>string</u> <b>=</b> <u>pattern</u>
                     Same as <b>==</b> above, but is obsolete.
              <u>string</u> <b>!=</b> <u>pattern</u>
                     True if <u>string</u> does not match <u>pattern</u>.  When the <u>string</u> matches the <u>pattern</u>  the  <b>.sh.match</b>
                     array variable will contain the match and subpattern matches.
              <u>string</u> <b>=∼</b> <u>ere</u>
                     True if <u>string</u> matches the pattern <b>∼(E)</b><u>ere</u> where <u>ere</u> is an extended regular expression.
              <u>string1</u> <b>&lt;</b> <u>string2</u>
                     True if <u>string1</u> comes before <u>string2</u> based on ASCII value of their characters.
              <u>string1</u> <b>&gt;</b> <u>string2</u>
                     True if <u>string1</u> comes after <u>string2</u> based on ASCII value of their characters.

       The following obsolete arithmetic comparisons are also permitted:
              <u>exp1</u> <b>-eq</b> <u>exp2</u>
                     True if <u>exp1</u> is equal to <u>exp2</u>.
              <u>exp1</u> <b>-ne</b> <u>exp2</u>
                     True if <u>exp1</u> is not equal to <u>exp2</u>.
              <u>exp1</u> <b>-lt</b> <u>exp2</u>
                     True if <u>exp1</u> is less than <u>exp2</u>.
              <u>exp1</u> <b>-gt</b> <u>exp2</u>
                     True if <u>exp1</u> is greater than <u>exp2</u>.
              <u>exp1</u> <b>-le</b> <u>exp2</u>
                     True if <u>exp1</u> is less than or equal to <u>exp2</u>.
              <u>exp1</u> <b>-ge</b> <u>exp2</u>
                     True if <u>exp1</u> is greater than or equal to <u>exp2</u>.

       In  each of the above expressions, if <u>file</u> is of the form <b><a href="file:/dev/fd/">/dev/fd/</a></b><u>n</u>, where <u>n</u> is an integer, then the test
       is applied to the open file whose descriptor number is <u>n</u>.  The <b>posix</b> shell option disables  this  special
       handling.

       A  compound  expression can be constructed from these primitives by using any of the following, listed in
       decreasing order of precedence:
              <b>(</b><u>expression</u><b>)</b>
                     True if <u>expression</u> is true.  Used to group expressions.
              <b>!</b> <u>expression</u>
                     True if <u>expression</u> is false.
              <u>expression1</u> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <u>expression2</u>
                     True if <u>expression1</u> and <u>expression2</u> are both true.
              <u>expression1</u> <b>||</b> <u>expression2</u>
                     True if either <u>expression1</u> or <u>expression2</u> is true.

   <b>Input/Output.</b>
       Before a command is executed, its input and output may be redirected using a special notation interpreted
       by the shell.  The following may appear anywhere in a <u>simple-command</u> or may precede or follow  a  <u>command</u>
       and  are <u>not</u> passed on to the invoked command.  Command substitution, parameter expansion, and arithmetic
       expansion occur before <u>word</u> or <u>digit</u> is used except as noted below.  Pathname expansion  occurs  only  if
       the shell is interactive and the pattern matches a single file.  Field splitting is not performed.

       In each of the following redirections, if <u>file</u> is of the form <b>/dev/sctp/</b><u>host</u><b>/</b><u>port</u>, <b>/dev/tcp/</b><u>host</u><b>/</b><u>port</u>, or
       <b>/dev/udp/</b><u>host</u><b>/</b><u>port</u>,  where  <u>host</u> is a hostname or host address, and <u>port</u> is a service given by name or an
       integer port number, then the redirection attempts  to  make  a  <b>tcp</b>,  <b>sctp</b>  or  <b>udp</b>  connection  to  the
       corresponding socket.

       No intervening space is allowed between the characters of redirection operators.

       <b>&lt;</b><u>word</u>         Use file <u>word</u> as standard input (file descriptor 0).

       <b>&gt;</b><u>word</u>         Use  file  <u>word</u> as standard output (file descriptor 1).  If the file does not exist then it
                     is created.  If the file exists, and the <b>noclobber</b> option is  on,  this  causes  an  error;
                     otherwise, it is truncated to zero length.

       <b>&gt;|</b><u>word</u>        Same as <b>&gt;</b>, except that it overrides the <b>noclobber</b> option.

       <b>&gt;;</b><u>word</u>        Write output to a temporary file.  If the command completes successfully rename it to <u>word</u>,
                     otherwise,  delete  the  temporary  file.  <b>&gt;;</b><u>word</u> cannot be used with the <u>exec</u> and <u>redirect</u>
                     built-ins.

       <b>&gt;&gt;</b><u>word</u>        Use file <u>word</u> as standard output.  If the file exists, then output is appended  to  it  (by
                     first seeking to the end-of-file); otherwise, the file is created.

       <b>&lt;&gt;</b><u>word</u>        Open  file <u>word</u> for reading and writing as standard output.  If the <b>posix</b> option is active,
                     it defaults to standard input instead.

       <b>&lt;&gt;;</b><u>word</u>       The same as <b>&lt;&gt;</b><u>word</u> except that if the command completes successfully, <u>word</u> is truncated  to
                     the offset at command completion.  <b>&lt;&gt;;</b><u>word</u> cannot be used with the <u>exec</u> and <u>redirect</u> built-
                     ins.

       <b>&lt;&lt;</b>[<b>-</b>]<u>word</u>     The  shell  input  is read up to a line that is the same as <u>word</u> after any quoting has been
                     removed, or to an end-of-file.  No parameter expansion,  command  substitution,  arithmetic
                     expansion  or  pathname  expansion  is performed on <u>word</u>.  The resulting document, called a
                     <u>here-document</u>, becomes the standard input.  If any character of <u>word</u>  is  quoted,  then  no
                     interpretation  is  placed  upon  the  characters  of  the  document;  otherwise, parameter
                     expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion occur, <b>\new-line</b> is ignored,  and
                     <b>\</b>  must  be used to quote the characters <b>\</b>, <b>$</b>, <b>`</b>.  If <b>-</b> is appended to <b>&lt;&lt;</b>, then all leading
                     tabs are stripped from <u>word</u> and from the document.  If <b>#</b> is appended to  <b>&lt;&lt;</b>,  then  leading
                     spaces and tabs will be stripped off the first line of the document and up to an equivalent
                     indentation will be stripped from the remaining lines and from <u>word</u>.  A tab stop is assumed
                     to occur at every 8 columns for the purposes of determining the indentation.

       <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;</b><u>word</u>       A short form of here document in which <u>word</u> becomes the contents of the here-document after
                     any parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion occur.

       <b>&lt;&amp;</b><u>digit</u>       The standard input is duplicated from file descriptor <u>digit</u> (see <u><a href="../man2/dup.2.html">dup</a></u>(2)).

       <b>&gt;&amp;</b><u>digit</u>       The standard output is duplicated from file descriptor <u>digit</u>.

       <b>&lt;&amp;</b><u>digit</u><b>-</b>      The file descriptor given by <u>digit</u> is moved to standard input.

       <b>&gt;&amp;</b><u>digit</u><b>-</b>      The file descriptor given by <u>digit</u> is moved to standard output.

       <b>&lt;&amp;-</b>           The standard input is closed.

       <b>&gt;&amp;-</b>           The standard output is closed.

       <b>&lt;&amp;p</b>           The input from the co-process is moved to standard input.

       <b>&gt;&amp;p</b>           The output to the co-process is moved to standard output.

       <b>&lt;#((</b><u>expr</u><b>))</b>    Evaluate  arithmetic  expression <u>expr</u> and position file descriptor 0 to the resulting value
                     bytes from the start of the file.  The variables <b>CUR</b> and <b>EOF</b> evaluate to the current offset
                     and end-of-file offset respectively when evaluating <u>expr.</u>

       <b>&gt;#((</b><u>offset</u><b>))</b>  The same as <b>&lt;#</b> except applies to file descriptor 1.

       <b>&lt;#</b><u>pattern</u>     Seeks forward to the beginning of the next line containing <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>&lt;##</b><u>pattern</u>    The same as <b>&lt;#</b> except that the portion of the file that is skipped is  copied  to  standard
                     output.

       If  one  of  the above is preceded by a digit, with no intervening space, then the file descriptor number
       referred to is that specified by the digit (instead of the default 0 or 1).  If one of the  above,  other
       than  <b>&gt;&amp;-</b>  and  the  <b>&gt;#</b>  and  <b>&lt;#</b>  forms,  is preceded by <b>{</b><u>varname</u><b>}</b> with no intervening space, then a file
       descriptor number &gt; 9 will be selected by the shell and stored in the variable <u>varname</u>, so it can be read
       from or written to with redirections like <b>&lt;&amp;</b> <u>$varname</u> or <b>&gt;&amp;</b> <u>$varname</u>.  If <b>&gt;&amp;-</b> or the any of the <b>&gt;#</b> and <b>&lt;#</b>
       forms is preceded by <b>{</b><u>varname</u><b>}</b> the value of <u>varname</u> defines the file descriptor  to  close  or  position.
       For example:

              <b>...</b> <b>2&gt;&amp;1</b>

       means file descriptor 2 is to be opened for writing as a duplicate of file descriptor 1 and

              <b>exec</b> <b>{n}&lt;file</b>

       means open file named <b>file</b> for reading and store the file descriptor number in variable <b>n</b>.

       A  special  shorthand redirection operator <b>&amp;&gt;</b><u>word</u> is available; it is equivalent to <b>&gt;</b><u>word</u> <b>2&gt;&amp;1</b>. It cannot
       be preceded by any digit or variable name. This shorthand is  disabled  if  the  <b>posix</b>  shell  option  is
       active.

       The  order  in  which redirections are specified is significant.  The shell evaluates each redirection in
       terms of the (<u>file</u> <u>descriptor</u>, <u>file</u>) association at the time of evaluation.  For example:

              <b>...</b> <b>1&gt;</b><u>fname</u> <b>2&gt;&amp;1</b>

       first associates file descriptor 1 with file <u>fname</u>.  It then associates file descriptor 2 with  the  file
       associated  with  file  descriptor  1  (i.e.   <u>fname</u>).   If the order of redirections were reversed, file
       descriptor 2 would be associated with the terminal (assuming file descriptor 1 had been)  and  then  file
       descriptor 1 would be associated with file <u>fname</u>.

       If  a  command  is  followed  by <b>&amp;</b> and job control is not active, then the default standard input for the
       command is the empty file <b>/dev/null</b>.  Otherwise, the environment for the execution of a command  contains
       the file descriptors of the invoking shell as modified by input/output specifications.

   <b>Environment.</b>
       The  <u>environment</u>  (see <u><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></u>(7)) is a list of name-value pairs that is passed to an executed program in
       the same way as a normal argument list.  The names must be  <u>identifiers</u>  and  the  values  are  character
       strings.   The  shell interacts with the environment in several ways.  On invocation, the shell scans the
       environment and creates a variable for each name found, giving it the corresponding value and  attributes
       and  marking  it  <u>export</u>.  Executed commands inherit the environment.  If the user modifies the values of
       these variables or creates new ones, using the <b>export</b> or <b>typeset</b> <b>-x</b> commands, they  become  part  of  the
       environment.   The  environment  seen  by  any  executed command is thus composed of any name-value pairs
       originally inherited by the shell, whose values may be modified by the current shell, plus any  additions
       which must be noted in <b>export</b> or <b>typeset</b> <b>-x</b> commands.

       Exported  variables  pass  their  attributes though the environment so that a newly invoked ksh that is a
       child or exec'd process of the current shell will automatically  import  them,  unless  the  <b>posix</b>  shell
       option  is  on.   As  of  ksh  93u+m/1.0, this never includes the <b>readonly</b> attribute.  Passing attributes
       through the environment is deprecated and this feature will be removed in ksh 93u+m/1.1.

       The environment for any <u>simple-command</u> or function may be augmented by prefixing  it  with  one  or  more
       variable assignments.  A variable assignment argument is a word of the form <u>identifier=value</u>.  Thus:

              <b>TERM=450</b> <b>cmd</b> <b>args</b>                  and
              <b>(export</b> <b>TERM;</b> <b>TERM=450;</b> <b>cmd</b> <b>args)</b>

       are  equivalent  (as  far as the above execution of <u>cmd</u> is concerned except for special built-in commands
       listed below - those that are marked with <b>†</b>).

       If the obsolete <b>-k</b> option is set, <u>all</u> variable assignment arguments are placed in the  environment,  even
       if they occur after the command name.  The following first prints <b>a=b</b> <b>c</b> and then <b>c</b>:

              <b>echo</b> <b>a=b</b> <b>c</b>
              <b>set</b> <b>-k</b>
              <b>echo</b> <b>a=b</b> <b>c</b>

       This  feature is intended for use with scripts written for early versions of the shell and its use in new
       scripts is strongly discouraged.  It is likely to disappear someday.

   <b>Functions.</b>
       For historical reasons, there are two ways to define functions, the <u>name</u><b>()</b> syntax and the  <b>function</b>  <u>name</u>
       syntax,  described  in  the  <u>Commands</u>  section above.  Shell functions are read in and stored internally.
       Alias names are resolved when the function is read.   Functions  are  executed  like  commands  with  the
       arguments passed as positional parameters.  (See <u>Execution</u> below.)

       Functions  defined  by  the  <b>function</b>  <u>name</u>  syntax and called by name execute in the same process as the
       caller and share all files and present working directory with the caller.  All changes to  shell  options
       are  local  to  the  function  call.  The <b>errexit</b> option is turned off in the function's scope.  The same
       applies to the <b>xtrace</b> option, unless the <b>functrace</b> shell option is set or the function was  tagged  using
       <b>typeset</b>  <b>-f</b>  <b>-t</b>.  The state of all other shell options is inherited from the caller.  Traps caught by the
       caller are reset to their default action inside the function.  A trap condition that  is  not  caught  or
       ignored by the function causes the function to terminate and the condition to be passed on to the caller.
       A  trap  on  <b>EXIT</b>  set  inside a function is executed in the environment of the caller after the function
       completes.  Ordinarily, variables are shared between the calling program and the function.  However,  the
       <b>typeset</b>  special built-in command used within a function defines local variables whose scope includes the
       current function.  They can be passed to functions that they call in the variable  assignment  list  that
       precedes  the  call or as arguments passed as name references.  Errors within functions return control to
       the caller.

       Functions defined with the <u>name</u><b>()</b> syntax and functions defined with the <b>function</b>  <u>name</u>  syntax  that  are
       invoked  with  the  <b>.</b>  special built-in are executed in the caller's environment and share all variables,
       options and traps with the caller.  Errors  within  these  function  executions  cause  the  script  that
       contains them to abort.

       The special built-in command <b>return</b> is used to return from function calls.

       Function  names can be listed with the <b>-f</b> or <b>+f</b> option of the <b>typeset</b> special built-in command.  The text
       of functions, when available, will also be listed with <b>-f</b>.  Functions can be undefined with the <b>-f</b> option
       of the <b>unset</b> special built-in command.

       Ordinarily, functions are unset when the shell executes a  shell  script.   Functions  that  need  to  be
       defined  across  separate invocations of the shell should be placed in a directory and the <b>FPATH</b> variable
       should contain the name of this directory.  They may also be specified in the <b>ENV</b> file.

   <b>Discipline</b> <b>Functions.</b>
       Each variable can have zero or more  discipline  functions  associated  with  it.   The  shell  initially
       understands  the  discipline  names <b>get</b>, <b>set</b>, <b>append</b>, and <b>unset</b> but can be added when defining new types.
       On most systems others can be added at run time via the C programming interface extension provided by the
       <b>builtin</b> built-in utility.  If the <b>get</b> discipline is defined for a variable, it is  invoked  whenever  the
       given  variable  is  referenced.   If  the  variable  <b>.sh.value</b> is assigned a value inside the discipline
       function, the referenced variable will evaluate to this value instead.  If the <b>set</b> discipline is  defined
       for  a variable, it is invoked whenever the given variable is assigned a value.  If the <b>append</b> discipline
       is defined for a variable, it is invoked whenever a  value  is  appended  to  the  given  variable.   The
       variable  <b>.sh.value</b>  is  given the value of the variable before invoking the discipline, and the variable
       will be assigned the value of <b>.sh.value</b> after the discipline completes.  If <b>.sh.value</b> is unset inside the
       discipline, then that value is unchanged.  If the <b>unset</b> discipline is  defined  for  a  variable,  it  is
       invoked whenever the given variable is unset.

       The  variable  <b>.sh.name</b>  contains  the  name of the variable for which the discipline function is called,
       <b>.sh.subscript</b> is the subscript of the variable, and <b>.sh.value</b>  will  contain  the  value  being  assigned
       inside  the  <b>set</b>  discipline  function.   The  variable  <b>_</b>  is  a reference to the variable including the
       subscript if any.  For the <b>set</b> discipline, changing <b>.sh.value</b> will change the value that  gets  assigned.
       Finally,  the  expansion  <b>${</b><u>var</u><b>.</b><u>name</u><b>}</b>, when <u>name</u> is the name of a discipline, and there is no variable of
       this name, is equivalent to the command substitution <b>${</b> <u>var</u><b>.</b><u>name</u><b>;}</b>.

   <b>Name</b> <b>Spaces.</b>
       Commands and functions that are executed as part of the <u>list</u> of a <b>namespace</b> command that modify variables
       or create new ones, create a new variable whose name is the name of the name space as given by <u>identifier</u>
       preceded by <b>.</b>.  When a variable whose name is  <u>name</u>  is  referenced,  it  is  first  searched  for  using
       <b>.</b><u>identifier</u><b>.</b><u>name</u>.   Similarly, a function defined by a command in the <b>namespace</b> <u>list</u> is created using the
       name space name preceded by a <b>.</b>.

       When the <u>list</u> of a <b>namespace</b> command contains a <b>namespace</b> command, the names of variables  and  functions
       that  are  created  consist  of  the  variable  or function name preceded by the list of <u>identifier</u>s each
       preceded by <b>.</b>.

       Outside of a name space, a variable or function  created  inside  a  name  space  can  be  referenced  by
       preceding it with the name space name.

       By default, variables starting with <b>.sh</b> are in the <b>sh</b> name space.

   <b>Type</b> <b>Variables.</b>
       Typed  variables  provide  a way to create data structure and objects.  A type can be defined either by a
       shared library, by the <b>enum</b> built-in command described below, or by  using  the  new  <b>-T</b>  option  of  the
       <b>typeset</b>  built-in command.  With the <b>-T</b> option of <b>typeset</b>, the type name, specified as an option argument
       to <b>-T</b>, is set with a compound variable assignment that defines the type.  Function definitions can appear
       inside the compound variable assignment and these become discipline functions for this type  and  can  be
       invoked or redefined by each instance of the type.  The function name <b>create</b> is treated specially.  It is
       invoked  for  each  instance of the type that is created but is not inherited and cannot be redefined for
       each instance.

       When a type is defined a special built-in command of that name is added.  These built-ins are declaration
       commands and follow the same expansion rules as the built-in commands described  below  that  are  marked
       with  a  ‡ symbol. These commands can subsequently be used inside further type definitions.  The man page
       for these commands can be generated by using the <b>--man</b> option or any of the other  <b>--</b>  options  described
       with  <b>getopts</b>.  The <b>-r</b>, <b>-a</b>, <b>-A</b>, <b>-h</b>, and <b>-S</b> options of <b>typeset</b> are permitted with each of these new built-
       ins.

       An instance of a type is created by invoking the type name followed by one or more instance names.   Each
       instance  of  the  type  is  initialized with a copy of the subvariables except for subvariables that are
       defined with the <b>-S</b> option.  Variables defined with the <b>-S</b> are shared by all instances of the type.  Each
       instance can change the value of any subvariable and can also define new discipline functions of the same
       names as those defined by the type definition as well as any standard discipline  names.   No  additional
       subvariables can be defined for any instance.

       When  defining  a  type,  if  the value of a subvariable is not set and the <b>-r</b> attribute is specified, it
       causes the subvariable to be a required subvariable.  Whenever an instance of  a  type  is  created,  all
       required subvariables must be specified.  These subvariables become read-only in each instance.

       When  <b>unset</b>  is  invoked  on a subvariable within a type, and the <b>-r</b> attribute has not been specified for
       this field, the value is reset to the default value associative with the type.  Invoking <b>unset</b> on a  type
       instance not contained within another type deletes all subvariables and the variable itself.

       A type definition can be derived from another type definition by defining the first subvariable name as <b>_</b>
       and  defining  its  type as the base type.  Any remaining definitions will be additions and modifications
       that apply to the new type.  If the new type name is the same as that of the base type, the type will  be
       replaced and the original type will no longer be accessible.

       The <b>typeset</b> command with the <b>-T</b> and no option argument or operands will write all the type definitions to
       standard output in a form that can be read in to create all they types.

   <b>Jobs.</b>
       If  the  <b>monitor</b>  option of the <b>set</b> command is turned on, an interactive shell associates a <u>job</u> with each
       pipeline.  It keeps a table of current jobs, printed by the <b>jobs</b> command, and assigns them small  integer
       numbers.  When a job is started asynchronously with <b>&amp;</b>, the shell prints a line which looks like:

            [1] 1234

       indicating  that  the  job  which  was  started  asynchronously  was job number 1 and had one (top-level)
       process, whose process ID was 1234.

       If you are running a job and wish to do something else, you may hit the key <b>^Z</b> (control-Z) which sends  a
       STOP  signal  to the current job.  The shell will then normally indicate that the job has been `Stopped',
       and print another prompt.  You can then manipulate the state of this job, putting it  in  the  background
       with  the  <b>bg</b>  command,  or  run  some  other  commands  and  then eventually bring the job back into the
       foreground with the foreground command <b>fg</b>.  A <b>^Z</b> takes effect immediately and is  like  an  interrupt  in
       that pending output and unread input are discarded when it is typed.

       A  job  being run in the background will stop if it tries to read from the terminal.  Background jobs are
       normally allowed to produce output, but this can be disabled by giving the command <b>stty</b> <b>tostop</b>.   If  you
       set  this  tty  option,  then background jobs will stop when they try to produce output like they do when
       they try to read input.

       There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell.  A job can be referred to by the process ID of  any
       process of the job or by one of the following:
              <b>%</b><u>number</u>
                     The job with the given number.
              <b>%</b><u>string</u>
                     Any job whose command line begins with <u>string</u>.
              <b>%?</b><u>string</u>
                     Any job whose command line contains <u>string</u>.
              <b>%%</b>     Current job.
              <b>%+</b>     Equivalent to <b>%%</b>.
              <b>%-</b>     Previous job.

       The  shell  learns  immediately whenever a process changes state.  It normally informs you whenever a job
       becomes blocked so that no further progress is possible, but only just before it prints a  prompt.   This
       is done so that it does not otherwise disturb your work.  The <b>notify</b> option of the <b>set</b> command causes the
       shell  to  print these job change messages as soon as they occur.  If this happens while you are typing a
       command with one of the built-in line editors active, the job change message  appears  above  your  input
       without disturbing your command entry.

       When the <b>monitor</b> option is on, each background job that completes triggers any trap set for <b>CHLD</b>.

       When  you  try  to  leave  the shell while jobs are running or stopped, you will be warned that `You have
       stopped(running) jobs.'  You may use the <b>jobs</b> command to see what they are.  If you  immediately  try  to
       exit  again,  the shell will not warn you a second time, and the stopped jobs will be terminated.  When a
       login shell receives a HUP signal, it sends a HUP signal to each job that has not been disowned with  the
       <b>disown</b> built-in command described below.

   <b>Signals.</b>
       The  INT  and  QUIT  signals  for  an invoked command are ignored if the command is followed by <b>&amp;</b> and the
       <b>monitor</b> option is not active.  Otherwise, signals have the values inherited by the shell from its  parent
       (but see also the <b>trap</b> built-in command below).

   <b>Execution.</b>
       Each time a command is read, the above expansions and substitutions are carried out.  If the command name
       matches  one  of  the  <u>Special</u>  <u>Built-in</u>  <u>Commands</u>  listed below, it is executed within the current shell
       process.  Next, the command name is checked to see if it matches a user defined function.   If  it  does,
       the  positional parameters are saved and then reset to the arguments of the <u>function</u> call.  A function is
       also executed in the current shell process.   When  the  <u>function</u>  completes  or  issues  a  <b>return</b>,  the
       positional parameter list is restored.  For functions defined with the <b>function</b> <u>name</u> syntax, any trap set
       on  <b>EXIT</b>  within the function is executed.  The exit value of a <u>function</u> is the value of the last command
       executed.  If a command name is not a <u>special</u> <u>built-in</u> <u>command</u> or a user defined <u>function</u>, but it is  one
       of the built-in commands listed below, it is executed in the current shell process.

       The shell variables <b>PATH</b> followed by the variable <b>FPATH</b> defines the list of directories to search for the
       command  name.   Alternative directory names are separated by a colon (<b>:</b>).  The default path is the value
       that was output by <b>getconf</b> <b>PATH</b> at the time ksh was compiled.  The current directory can be specified  by
       two or more adjacent colons, or by a colon at the beginning or end of the path list.  If the command name
       contains  a  <b>/</b>,  then  the search path is not used.  Otherwise, each directory in the list of directories
       defined by <b>PATH</b> and <b>FPATH</b> is checked in order.  If the directory being searched is contained in <b>FPATH</b> and
       contains a file whose name matches the command being searched, then this file is loaded into the  current
       shell  environment  as  if  it  were  the  argument  to the <b>.</b> command except that only preset aliases are
       expanded, and a function of the given name is executed as described above.

       If this directory is not in <b>FPATH</b> the shell first determines whether there is a  built-in  version  of  a
       command corresponding to a given pathname and if so it is invoked in the current process.  If no built-in
       is  found,  the  shell checks for a file named <b>.paths</b> in this directory.  If found and there is a line of
       the form <b>FPATH=</b><u>path</u> where <u>path</u> names an existing directory then that directory  is  searched  immediately
       after the current directory as if it were found in the <b>FPATH</b> variable.  If <u>path</u> does not begin with /, it
       is checked for relative to the directory being searched.

       The  <b>.paths</b>  file  is  then  checked  for a line of the form <b>PLUGIN_LIB=</b><u>libname</u> [ <b>:</b> <u>libname</u> ] ... .  Each
       library named by <u>libname</u> will be searched for as if it were an option argument to <b>builtin</b> <b>-f</b>, and  if  it
       contains  a  built-in of the specified name this will be executed instead of a command by this name.  Any
       built-in loaded from a library found this way will be associated with the directory containing the <b>.paths</b>
       file so it will only execute if not found in an earlier directory.

       Finally, the directory will be checked for a file of the given name.  If the file has execute  permission
       but  is  not  an  <b>a.out</b>  file, it is assumed to be a file containing shell commands.  A separate shell is
       spawned to read it.  All non-exported variables are removed in this case.  If the <b>.paths</b> contains a  line
       of  the  form  <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>  in the first or second line, then the environment variable <u>name</u> is modified by
       prepending the directory specified by <u>value</u>  to  the  directory  list.   If  <u>value</u>  is  not  an  absolute
       directory, then it specifies a directory relative to the directory that the executable was found.  If the
       environment  variable  <u>name</u>  does  not  already  exist  it  will be added to the environment list for the
       specified command.  A parenthesized command is executed  in  a  subshell  without  removing  non-exported
       variables.

   <b>Command</b> <b>Re-entry.</b>
       The text of the last <b>HISTSIZE</b> (default 512) commands entered from a terminal device is saved in a <u>history</u>
       file.   The file <b>$HOME/.sh_history</b> is used if the <b>HISTFILE</b> variable is not set or if the file it names is
       not writable.  A shell can access the commands of  all  <u>interactive</u>  shells  which  use  the  same  named
       <b>HISTFILE</b>.   The built-in command <b>hist</b> is used to list or edit a portion of this file.  The portion of the
       file to be edited or listed can be selected by number or by giving the first character or  characters  of
       the  command.   A  single command or range of commands can be specified.  If you do not specify an editor
       program as an argument to <b>hist</b> then the value of the variable <b>HISTEDIT</b> is used.  If  <b>HISTEDIT</b>  is  unset,
       the  obsolete  variable  <b>FCEDIT</b>  is  used.   If  <b>FCEDIT</b> is not defined, then <b><a href="file:/bin/ed">/bin/ed</a></b> is used.  The edited
       command(s) is printed and re-executed upon leaving the editor unless you quit without  writing.   The  <b>-s</b>
       option  (and in obsolete versions, the editor name <b>-</b>) is used to skip the editing phase and to re-execute
       the command.  In this case a substitution parameter of the form <u>old</u><b>=</b><u>new</u> can be used to modify the command
       before execution.  For example, with the preset alias <b>r</b>,  which  is  aliased  to  <b>′hist</b>  <b>-s′</b>,  typing  `<b>r</b>
       <b>bad=good</b>  <b>c</b>'  will re-execute the most recent command which starts with the letter <b>c</b>, replacing the first
       occurrence of the string <b>bad</b> with the string <b>good</b>.

   <b>History</b> <b>Expansion.</b>
       History expansions introduce words from the history list into the input stream, making it easy to  repeat
       commands,  repeat  arguments  of  a previous command in the current command, or fix typos in the previous
       command.  The history expansion facility is an alternative to history control via the <b>fc</b> or <b>hist</b> built-in
       command.  To enable it, turn on the <b>-H</b> or <b>histexpand</b> option using the <b>set</b> command (see <u>Built-in</u>  <u>Commands</u>
       below).

       History  expansions  begin  with the character <b>!</b>.  They may begin anywhere in the input.  The <b>!</b> is passed
       unchanged with its special meaning disabled when preceded by <b>\</b> or  <b>${</b>,  enclosed  in  single  quotes,  or
       followed  by  a space, tab, newline, <b>=</b> or <b>(</b>.  History expansions do not nest.  They are parsed separately
       before the shell parser is invoked, so they can override shell grammar rules.

       By default, the expanded version of any line that contains a history expansion is printed, added  to  the
       history,  and  then  immediately executed.  History expansions are never added to the history themselves,
       regardless of whether they succeed or fail due to an error.  Normally, this means  that  a  command  line
       with  an  erroneous history expansion is lost and needs to be retyped from scratch, but if the <b>histreedit</b>
       shell option is turned on and a line editor is active (see <u>In-line</u> <u>Editing</u> <u>Options</u> below), the  erroneous
       line  is pre-filled into the next prompt's input buffer for correcting.  The <b>histverify</b> option causes the
       same to be done for the results of successful  history  expansions,  allowing  verification  and  editing
       before execution.

       A history expansion may have an <u>event</u> <u>specification</u>, which indicates the event from which words are to be
       taken,  a <u>word</u> <u>designator</u>, which selects particular words from the chosen event, and/or a <u>modifier</u>, which
       manipulates the selected words.

       An event specification can be:

           <u>n</u>       A number, referring to a particular event.
           <b>-</b><u>n</u>      An offset, referring to the event <u>n</u> before the current event.
           <b>#</b>       The current event.
           <b>!</b>       The previous event (equivalent to <b>-1</b>).
           <u>s</u>       The most recent event whose first word begins with the string <u>s</u>.
           <b>?</b><u>s</u><b>?</b>     The most recent event which contains the string <u>s</u>.  The second <b>?</b> can  be  omitted  if  it  is
                   immediately followed by a newline.

       For example, consider this bit of someone's history list as might be output by the <b>hist</b> <b>-l</b> command:

           9        nroff -man wumpus.man
           10       cp wumpus.man wumpus.man.old
           11       vi wumpus.man
           12       diff wumpus.man.old wumpus.man

       The  commands  are  shown with their event numbers.  The current event, which we haven't typed in yet, is
       event 13.  <b>!11</b> and <b>!-2</b> refer to event 11.  <b>!!</b> refers to the previous event, 12.  <b>!!</b> can be abbreviated  <b>!</b>
       if  it  is  followed by <b>:</b> (see below).  <b>!n</b> refers to event 9, which begins with <b>n</b>.  <b>!?old?</b> also refers to
       event 12, which contains <b>old</b>.  Without word designators or modifiers, history references simply expand to
       the entire event, so we might type <b>!cp</b> to redo the copy command or <b>!!|more</b> if the  <b>diff</b>  output  scrolled
       off the top of the screen.

       To  select  words  from an event, the event specification can be followed by a <b>:</b> and a designator for the
       desired words.  The words of an input line are numbered from 0, the first word (usually the command name)
       being 0, the second word (first argument) being 1, etc.  The basic word designators are:

           <b>0</b>       The first word (command name).
           <u>n</u>       The <u>n</u>th argument.
           <b>^</b>       The first argument, equivalent to <b>1</b>.
           <b>$</b>       The last argument.
           <b>%</b>       The word matched by the most recent <b>?</b><u>s</u><b>?</b> search.
           <b>x</b><u>-</u><b>y</b>     A range of words.
           <b>-</b><u>y</u>      Equivalent to <b>0-</b><u>y</u>.
           <b>*</b>       Equivalent to <b>^-$</b>, but returns nothing if the event contains only 1 word.
           <u>x</u><b>*</b>      Equivalent to <u>x</u><b>-$</b>.
           <u>x</u><b>-</b>      Equivalent to <u>x</u><b>*</b>, but omitting the last word (<b>$</b>).

       Selected words are inserted into the command line separated by single  blanks.   For  example,  the  <b>diff</b>
       command in the previous example might have been typed as <b>diff</b> <b>!!:1.old</b> <b>!!:1</b> (using <b>:1</b> to select the first
       argument  from  the  previous  event)  or  <b>diff</b>  <b>!-2:2</b> <b>!-2:1</b> to select and swap the arguments from the <b>cp</b>
       command.  If we didn't care about the order of the <b>diff</b>, we might have said <b>diff</b> <b>!-2:1-2</b> or  simply  <b>diff</b>
       <b>!-2:*</b>.   The  <b>cp</b>  command might have been written <b>cp</b> <b>wumpus.man</b> <b>!#:1.old</b>, using <b>#</b> to refer to the current
       event.  <b>!n:-</b> <b>hurkle.man</b> would reuse the first two  words  from  the  <b>nroff</b>  command  to  say  <b>nroff</b>  <b>-man</b>
       <b>hurkle.man</b>.

       The <b>:</b> separating the event specification from the word designator can be omitted if the argument selector
       begins  with  a  <b>^</b>,  <b>$</b>,  <b>*</b>,  <b>%</b>  or <b>-</b>.  For example, our <b>diff</b> command might have been <b>diff</b> <b>!!^.old</b> <b>!!^</b> or,
       equivalently, <b>diff</b> <b>!!$.old</b> <b>!!$</b>.  However, if <b>!!</b> is abbreviated <b>!</b>, an argument selector beginning  with  <b>-</b>
       will be interpreted as an event specification.

       The  word(s)  in  a  history  reference  can be edited by following them with one or more modifiers, each
       preceded by a colon (<b>:</b>):

           <b>h</b>       Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving the head.
           <b>t</b>       Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.
           <b>r</b>       Remove a filename extension <b>.xxx</b>, leaving the root name.
           <b>e</b>       Remove all but the extension.
           <b>s/</b><u>l</u><b>/</b><u>r</u><b>/</b>  Substitute <u>l</u> for <u>r</u>.  <u>l</u> is simply a string  like  <u>r</u>,  not  a  regular  expression  as  in  the
                   eponymous  <u><a href="../man1/ed.1.html">ed</a></u>(1)  command.  Any character may be used as the delimiter in place of <b>/</b>; a <b>\</b> can
                   be used to quote the delimiter inside <u>l</u> and <u>r</u>.  The character <b>&amp;</b> in the <u>r</u> is replaced by <u>l</u>;  <b>\</b>
                   also  quotes  <b>&amp;</b>.  If <u>l</u> is empty, the <u>l</u> from the previous substitution is used, or if there is
                   none, the <u>s</u> from the most recent <b>?</b><u>s</u><b>?</b> search.  The trailing delimiter may be omitted if it  is
                   immediately followed by a newline.
           <b>&amp;</b>       Repeat the previous substitution.
           <b>g</b>       Global  substitution,  for  example  <b>:gs/foo/bar/</b> or <b>:g&amp;</b>.  Applies the <b>s</b> or <b>&amp;</b> modifier to the
                   entire command line.
           <b>a</b>       Same as <b>g</b>.
           <b>p</b>       Print the new command line but do not execute it.
           <b>q</b>       Quote the expanded words, preventing further expansions.
           <b>x</b>       Like <b>q</b>, but break into words at blanks, tabs and newlines.

       Modifiers are applied to only the first modifiable word (unless <b>g</b> or <b>a</b> is used).  It is an error  for  no
       word to be modifiable.

       For  example,  the  <b>diff</b> command might have been written as <b>diff</b> <b>wumpus.man.old</b> <b>!#^:r</b>, using <b>:r</b> to remove
       <b>.old</b> from the first argument on the same line (<b>!#^</b>).  We might follow <b>mail</b> <b>-s</b> <b>"I</b> <b>forgot</b> <b>my</b> <b>password"</b>  <b>rot</b>
       with <b>!:s/rot/root</b> to correct the spelling of <b>root</b>.

       History  expansions  also  occur  when an input line begins with <b>^</b>.  When it is the first character on an
       input line, it is an abbreviation of <b>!:s^</b>.  Thus we might  have  said  <b>^rot^root</b>  to  make  the  spelling
       correction  in  the  previous example.  This is the only history expansion that does not explicitly begin
       with <b>!</b>.

       If a word on a command line begins with the history comment character <b>#</b>, history expansion is ignored for
       the rest of that line.  This usually causes the shell parser (which uses the same character to  signal  a
       comment)  to  treat  the  rest  of  the  line  as  a  comment as well, but as history expansion is parsed
       separately from the shell grammar and with different rules, this cannot be guaranteed in all  cases.   If
       the  history comment character is changed, the shell grammar comment character does not change along with
       it.

       The three characters used to signal history expansion can be changed using the <b>histchars</b> shell  variable;
       see <u>Shell</u> <u>Variables</u> above.

   <b>In-line</b> <b>Editing</b> <b>Options.</b>
       Normally,  each  command  line  entered  from  a  terminal  device is simply typed followed by a <b>new-line</b>
       (`RETURN' or `LINE FEED').  If either the <b>emacs</b>, <b>gmacs</b>, or <b>vi</b> option is active, the  user  can  edit  the
       command  line.   To be in either of these edit modes, <b>set</b> the corresponding option.  An editing option is
       automatically selected each time the <b>VISUAL</b> or <b>EDITOR</b> variable is assigned a value matching any of  these
       editor names; for details, see <u>Shell</u> <u>Variables</u> above under <b>VISUAL</b>.

       The  editing  features  require  that the user's terminal accept `RETURN' as carriage return without line
       feed and that a space (` ') must overwrite the current character on the screen.

       Unless the <b>multiline</b> option is on, the editing modes implement  a  concept  where  the  user  is  looking
       through  a  window  at  the  current  line.   The  window width is the value of <b>COLUMNS</b> if it is defined,
       otherwise 80.  If the window width is too small to display the prompt and leave at  least  8  columns  to
       enter  input,  the  prompt is truncated from the left.  If the line is longer than the window width minus
       two, a mark is displayed at the end of the window to notify the user.  As the cursor  moves  and  reaches
       the  window boundaries, the window will be centered about the cursor.  The mark is a <b>&gt;</b> (&lt;<b>,</b> <b>*</b>) if the line
       extends on the right (left, both) side(s) of the window.

       The search commands in each edit mode provide access to the history file.  Only strings are matched,  not
       patterns,  although  a leading <b>^</b> in the string restricts the match to begin at the first character in the
       line.

       Each of the edit modes has an operation to list the files or commands  that  match  a  partially  entered
       word.   When applied to the first word on the line, or the first word after a <b>;</b>, <b>|</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, or <b>(</b>, and the word
       does not begin with <b>∼</b> or contain a <b>/</b>, the list of aliases, functions, and executable commands defined  by
       the  <b>PATH</b>  variable  that  could  match the partial word is displayed.  Otherwise, the list of files that
       match the given word is displayed.  If the partially entered word does not  contain  any  file  expansion
       characters,  a  <b>*</b>  is  appended  before generating these lists.  After displaying the generated list, the
       input line is redrawn.  These  operations  are  called  command  name  listing  and  file  name  listing,
       respectively.   There  are  additional  operations,  referred to as command name completion and file name
       completion, which compute the list of matching commands or files,  but  instead  of  printing  the  list,
       replace  the  current  word  with a complete or partial match.  For file name completion, if the match is
       unique, a <b>/</b> is appended if the file is a directory and  a  space  is  appended  if  the  file  is  not  a
       directory.   Otherwise,  the  longest  common  prefix  for all the matching files replaces the word.  For
       command name completion, only the portion of the file names after the last <b>/</b> are used to find the longest
       command prefix.  If only a single name matches this prefix, then the word is replaced  with  the  command
       name  followed  by  a  space.   When  using  a  <u>tab</u>  for completion that does not yield a unique match, a
       subsequent <u>tab</u> will provide a numbered list of matching alternatives.  A specific selection can  be  made
       by  entering  the  selection  number  followed  by  a <u>tab</u>.  Neither completion nor listing operations are
       attempted before the first character in a line.

   <b>Key</b> <b>Bindings.</b>
       The <b>KEYBD</b> trap can be used to intercept keys as they  are  typed  and  change  the  characters  that  are
       actually  seen  by the shell.  This trap is executed after each character (or sequence of characters when
       the first character is ESC) is entered while reading from a terminal.  The variable  <b>.sh.edchar</b>  contains
       the  character  or  character sequence which generated the trap.  Changing the value of <b>.sh.edchar</b> in the
       trap action causes the shell to behave as if the new value were entered from the keyboard rather than the
       original value.

       The variable <b>.sh.edcol</b> is set to the input column number of the cursor at the time  of  the  input.   The
       variable  <b>.sh.edmode</b>  is  set  to  ESC  when  in  <b>vi</b>  input  mode (see below) and set to the empty string
       otherwise.  Prepending <b>${.sh.editmode}</b> to a value assigned to <b>.sh.edchar</b> will cause the shell  to  change
       to control mode if it is not already in this mode.

       This  trap  is  not  invoked  for characters entered as arguments to editing directives, or while reading
       input for a character search.

   <b>Emacs</b> <b>Editing</b> <b>Mode.</b>
       This mode is entered by enabling either the <b>emacs</b> or <b>gmacs</b> option.  The only difference between these two
       modes is the way they handle <b>^T</b>.  To edit, the user moves the cursor to the point needing correction  and
       then  inserts  or deletes characters or words as needed.  All the editing commands are control characters
       or escape sequences.  The notation for control characters is caret (<b>^</b>) followed by  the  character.   For
       example,  <b>^F</b>  is  the  notation  for control <b>F</b>.  This is entered by depressing `f' while holding down the
       `CTRL' (control) key.  The `SHIFT' key is <u>not</u> depressed.  (The notation <b>^?</b>  indicates  the  DEL  (delete)
       key.)

       The notation for escape sequences is <b>M-</b> followed by a character.  For example, <b>M-f</b> (pronounced Meta f) is
       entered  by  depressing  ESC (ASCII <b>033</b>) followed by `f'.  (<b>M-F</b> would be the notation for ESC followed by
       `SHIFT' (capital) `F'.)

       All edit commands operate from any place on the line (not just at the beginning).  Neither  the  `RETURN'
       nor the `LINE FEED' key is entered after edit commands except when noted.

       The  <b>M-[</b>  multi-character  commands  below  are  DEC  VT220 escape sequences generated by special keys on
       standard PC keyboards, such as the arrow keys.  You could type  them  directly  but  they  are  meant  to
       recognize the keys in question, which are indicated in parentheses.

       <u>erase</u>     (User defined erase character as defined by the <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1) command, usually <b>^H</b>.)  Delete  previous
                 character.
       <u>lnext</u>     (User  defined literal next character as defined by the <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1) command, or <b>^V</b> if not defined.)

                 this command will not work).
       <b>^T</b>        Transpose  current  character  with  previous  character  and advance the cursor in <u>emacs</u> mode.

       <b>M-l</b>       Change the current word to lower case.
       <b>^K</b>        Delete from the cursor to the end of the line.  If preceded  by  a  numerical  parameter  whose
                 value  is  less  than  the  current  cursor position, then delete from given position up to the
                 cursor.  If preceded by a numerical parameter whose value is greater than  the  current  cursor
                 position, then delete from cursor up to given cursor position.
       <b>^W</b>        Kill from the cursor to the mark.
       <b>M-p</b>       Push the region from the cursor to the mark on the stack.
       <u>kill</u>      (User  defined  kill character as defined by the <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1) command, usually <b>^U</b>.)  Kill the entire
                 current line.  If two <u>kill</u> characters are entered in succession, all kill characters from  then
                 on cause a line feed (useful when using paper terminals).  A subsequent pair of <u>kill</u> characters
                 undoes this change.
       <b>^Y</b>        Restore last item removed from line. (Yank item back to the line.)
       <b>^X^E</b>      Return the command <b>hist</b> <b>-e</b> <b>${VISUAL:-${EDITOR:-vi}}</b> in the input buffer to call a full editor —
                 <b>vi</b> by default — on the current command line.

       <b>M-^L</b>      Clear the screen.
       <b>^@</b>        (Null character) Set mark.
       <b>M-</b><u>space</u>   (Meta space) Set mark.
       <b>^J</b>        (New line) Execute the current line.
       <b>^M</b>        (Return) Execute the current line.
       <u>eof</u>       End-of-file  character, normally <b>^D</b>, is processed as an End-of-file only if the current line is
                 empty.
       <b>^P</b>        Fetch previous command.  Each time <b>^P</b> is entered the previous command back in time is accessed.
                 Moves back one line when not on the first line of a multi-line command.
       <b>M-[A</b>      (Up arrow) If the cursor is at the end of the line, it is equivalent to <b>^R</b> with <u>string</u>  set  to
                 the contents of the current line.  Otherwise, it is equivalent to <b>^P</b>.
       <b>M-&lt;</b>       Fetch the least recent (oldest) history line.
       <b>M-&gt;</b>       Fetch the most recent (youngest) history line.
       <b>^N</b>        Fetch  next  command  line.   Each  time <b>^N</b> is entered the next command line forward in time is
                 accessed.
       <b>M-[B</b>      (Down arrow) Equivalent to <b>^N</b>.
       <b>^R</b><u>string</u>  Reverse search history for a previous command line containing <u>string</u>.  If a parameter  of  zero
                 is  given, the search is forward.  <u>String</u> is terminated by a `RETURN' or `NEW LINE'.  If string
                 is preceded by a <b>^</b>, the matched line must begin with <u>string</u>.  If <u>string</u> is  omitted,  then  the
                 next  command  line containing the most recent <u>string</u> is accessed.  In this case a parameter of
                 zero reverses the direction of the search.
       <b>^G</b>        Exit reverse search mode.
       <b>^O</b>        Operate - Execute the current line and fetch the next line relative to current  line  from  the
                 history file.
       <b>M-</b><u>digits</u>  (Escape)  Define  numeric  parameter,  the digits are taken as a parameter to the next command.
                 The commands that accept a parameter are <b>^F</b>, <b>^B</b>, <u>erase</u>, <b>^C</b>, <b>^D</b>, <b>^K</b>, <b>^R</b>, <b>^P</b>, <b>^N</b>, <b>^]</b>, <b>M-.</b>,  <b>M-^]</b>,

       <b>M-</b><u>letter</u>  Soft-key - Your alias list is searched for an alias by the name <b>_</b><u>letter</u> and if an alias of this
                 name  is defined, its value will be inserted on the input queue.  The <u>letter</u> must not be one of
                 the above meta-functions.
       <b>M-[</b><u>letter</u> Soft-key - Your alias list is searched for an alias by the name <b>__</b><u>letter</u> and  if  an  alias  of
                 this  name  is  defined,  its  value  will be inserted on the input queue.  This can be used to
                 program function keys on many terminals.
       <b>M-.</b>       The last word of the previous command is inserted on  the  line.   If  preceded  by  a  numeric
                 parameter,  the  value  of  this parameter determines which word to insert rather than the last
                 word.
       <b>M-_</b>       Same as <b>M-.</b>.
       <b>M-*</b>       Attempt pathname expansion on the current word.  An asterisk is appended if  the  word  doesn't
                 match any file or contain any special pattern characters.
       <b>M-ESC</b>     Command or file name completion as described above.
       <b>^I</b> <u>tab</u>    Attempts  command  or file name completion as described above.  If a partial completion occurs,
                 repeating this will behave as if <b>M-=</b> were entered.  If no  match  is  found  or  entered  after
                 <u>space</u>, a <u>tab</u> is inserted.
       <b>M-=</b>       If  not  preceded  by  a  numeric parameter, it generates the list of matching commands or file
                 names as described above.  Otherwise, the word  under  the  cursor  is  replaced  by  the  item
                 corresponding to the value of the numeric parameter from the most recently generated command or
                 file list.  If the cursor is not on a word, it is inserted instead.
       <b>^U</b>        Multiply parameter of next command by 4.
       <b>\</b>         If  the  <b>backslashctrl</b> shell option is on (which is the default setting), this escapes the next
                 character.  Editing characters, the user's erase, kill and interrupt (normally  <b>^C</b>)  characters
                 may  be  entered in a command line or in a search string if preceded by a <b>\</b>.  The <b>\</b> removes the
                 next character's editing features (if any).  See also <u>lnext</u> which is not subject to  any  shell
                 option.
       <b>M-^V</b>      Display version of the shell.
       <b>M-[2~</b>     (Insert) Escape the next character.
       <b>M-#</b>       If  the  line  does  not begin with a <b>#</b>, a <b>#</b> is inserted at the beginning of the line and after
                 each new-line, and the line is entered.  This causes a comment to be inserted  in  the  history
                 file.   If  the  line  begins  with a <b>#</b>, the <b>#</b> is deleted and one <b>#</b> after each new-line is also
                 deleted.

   <b>Vi</b> <b>Editing</b> <b>Mode.</b>
       There are two typing modes.  Initially, when you enter a command you are in the <u>input</u> mode.  To edit, the
       user enters <u>control</u> mode by typing ESC (<b>033</b>) and moves the cursor to the  point  needing  correction  and
       then  inserts  or deletes characters or words as needed.  Most control commands accept an optional repeat
       <u>count</u> prior to the command.

       The notation for control characters used below is <b>^</b> followed by a character. For instance, <b>^H</b> is  entered
       by  holding  down  the  Control  key  and  pressing H.  <b>^[</b> (Control+<b>[</b>) is equivalent to the ESC key.  The
       notation for escape sequences is <b>^[</b> followed by one or more characters.

       The <b>^[[</b> (ESC <b>[</b>) multi-character commands below are DEC VT220 escape sequences generated by  special  keys
       on standard PC keyboards, such as the arrow keys, which are indicated in parentheses. When in <u>input</u> mode,
       these  keys will switch you to <u>control</u> mode before performing the associated action.  These sequences can
       use preceding repeat count parameters, but only when the <b>^[</b> and the subsequent <b>[</b>  are  entered  into  the
       input buffer at the same time, such as when pressing one of those keys.

        <b>Input</b> <b>Edit</b> <b>Commands</b>
              By default the editor is in input mode.

              <u>erase</u>     (User  defined  erase  character  as  defined  by the <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1) command, usually <b>^H</b> or <b>#</b>.)
                        Delete previous character.
              <b>^W</b>        Delete the previous blank separated word.
              <u>eof</u>       As the first character of the line causes the shell to terminate  unless  the  <b>ignoreeof</b>
                        option is set.  Otherwise this character is ignored.
              <u>lnext</u>     (User  defined  literal  next character as defined by the <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1) or <b>^V</b> if not defined.)
                        Removes the next character's editing features (if any).
              <b>\</b>         If the <b>backslashctrl</b> shell option is on (which is the default setting), this escapes the
                        next <u>erase</u> or <u>kill</u> character.
              <b>^I</b> <u>tab</u>    Attempts command or file name completion as described above and returns to  input  mode.
                        If  a  partial  completion  occurs, repeating this will behave as if <b>=</b> were entered from
                        control mode.  If no match is found or entered after <u>space</u>, a <u>tab</u> is inserted.

                        Yank current character through character that <u>motion</u> would move the cursor to  and  puts
                        them into the delete buffer.  The text and cursor are unchanged.
              <b>yy</b>        Yanks the entire line.
              <b>Y</b>         Yanks from current position to end of line.  Equivalent to <b>y$</b>.
              <b>u</b>         Undo the last text modifying command.
              <b>U</b>         Undo all the text modifying commands performed on the line.
              [<u>count</u>]<b>v</b>  Returns the command <b>hist</b> <b>-e</b> <b>${VISUAL:-${EDITOR:-vi}}</b> <u>count</u> in the input buffer to call a
                        full editor — <b>vi</b> by default — on a history entry.  If <u>count</u> is omitted, then the current
                        line is used.
              <b>^L</b>        Line feed and print current line.  Has effect only in control mode.
              <b>^J</b>        (New line) Execute the current line, regardless of mode.
              <b>^M</b>        (Return) Execute the current line, regardless of mode.
              <b>#</b>         If  the first character of the command is a <b>#</b>, then this command deletes this <b>#</b> and each
                        <b>#</b> that follows a newline.  Otherwise, sends the line after inserting a  <b>#</b>  in  front  of
                        each  line  in  the  command.  Useful for causing the current line to be inserted in the
                        history as a comment and uncommenting previously commented commands in the history file.
              [<u>count</u>]<b>=</b>  If <u>count</u> is not specified, it generates the list of matching commands or file  names  as
                        described  above.   Otherwise,  the  word under the cursor is replaced by the <u>count</u> item
                        from the most recently generated command or file list.  If the cursor is not on a  word,
                        it is inserted instead.
              <b>@</b><u>letter</u>   Your  alias  list  is  searched for an alias by the name <b>_</b><u>letter</u> and if an alias of this
                        name is defined, its value will be inserted on the input queue for processing.
              <b>^V</b>        Display version of the shell.

   <b>Built-in</b> <b>Commands.</b>
       The <u>simple-command</u>s listed below are built in to the shell and are executed in the same  process  as  the
       shell.   The effects of any added Input/Output redirections are local to the command, except for the <b>exec</b>
       and <b>redirect</b> commands.  Unless otherwise indicated, the  output  is  written  on  standard  output  (file
       descriptor  1)  and  the exit status, when there is no syntax error, is zero.  Except for <b>:</b>, <b>true</b>, <b>false</b>,
       and <b>echo</b>, all built-in commands accept <b>--</b> to indicate end of options, and are self-documenting.

       The self-documenting commands interpret the option <b>--man</b> as a  request  to  display  that  command's  own
       manual  page,  <b>--help</b>  as  a  request to display the <u>OPTIONS</u> section from their manual page, and <b>-?</b>  as a
       request to print a brief usage message.  All these are processed as error messages, so they  are  written
       on  standard  error  (file  descriptor 2) and to pipe them into a pager such as <u><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></u>(1) you need to add a
       <b>2&gt;&amp;1</b> redirection before the <b>|</b>. The display of boldface text depends on whether standard  error  is  on  a
       terminal,  so  is  disabled  when  using a pager. Exporting the <b>ERROR_OPTIONS</b> environment variable with a
       value containing <u>emphasis</u> will force this on; a value containing <u>noemphasis</u> forces it  off.   The  <b>test</b>/<b>[</b>
       command needs an additional <b>--</b> argument to recognize self-documentation options, e.g. <b>test</b> <b>--man</b> <b>--</b>.  The
       <b>exec</b> and <b>redirect</b> commands, as they make redirections permanent, should use self-documentation options in
       a  subshell  when  redirecting, for example: <b>(redirect</b> <b>--man)</b> <b>2&gt;&amp;1</b>.  There are advanced output options as
       well; see <b>getopts</b> <b>--man</b> for more information.

       Commands that are preceded by a † symbol below are <u>special</u> <u>built-in</u> <u>commands</u> and are treated specially in
       the following ways:
              1.     Variable assignment  lists  preceding  the  command  remain  in  effect  when  the  command
                     completes.
              2.     I/O redirections are processed after variable assignments.
              3.     Errors cause a script that contains them to abort.
              4.     They are not valid function names.

       Commands that are preceded by a ‡ symbol below are <u>declaration</u> <u>commands</u>.  Any following words that are in
       the  format  of  a  variable  assignment are expanded with the same rules as a variable assignment.  This
       means  that  tilde  expansion  is  performed  after  the  <b>=</b>  sign,  array   assignments   of   the   form
       <u>varname</u><b>=(</b><u>assign_list</u><b>)</b> are supported, and field splitting and pathname expansion are not performed.

       † <b>:</b> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              The command only expands parameters.

       † <b>.</b> <u>name</u> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              If  <u>name</u>  is  a  function  defined  with  the  <b>function</b> <u>name</u> reserved word syntax, the function is
              executed in the current environment (as if it had been defined with the <u>name</u><b>()</b> syntax).  Otherwise
              if <u>name</u> refers to a file, the file is read in its entirety and the commands are  executed  in  the
              current  shell  environment.   The  search  path  specified  by <b>PATH</b> is used to find the directory
              containing the file.  If any arguments <u>arg</u> are given, they become the positional parameters  while
              processing  the  <b>.</b>   command  and the original positional parameters are restored upon completion.
              Otherwise the positional parameters are unchanged.  The exit status is the exit status of the last
              command executed.

       <b>[</b> <u>expression</u> <b>]</b>
              The <b>[</b> command is the same as <b>test</b>, with the exception that an additional  closing  <b>]</b>  argument  is
              required. See <b>test</b> below.

       <b>alias</b> [ <b>-ptx</b> ]  [ <u>name</u>[ <b>=</b><u>value</u>  ] ] ...
              <b>alias</b> with no arguments prints the list of aliases in the form <u>name=value</u> on standard output.  The
              <b>-p</b>  option  causes  the word <b>alias</b> to be inserted before each one.  When one or more arguments are
              given, an <u>alias</u> is defined for each <u>name</u> whose <u>value</u> is given.  A trailing space in  <u>value</u>  causes
              the next word to be checked for alias substitution.  With the <b>-t</b> option, <b>alias</b> acts like <b>hash</b>; see
              there.  Without the <b>-t</b> option, for each <u>name</u> in the argument list for which no <u>value</u> is given, the
              name  and  value  of the alias is printed.  The obsolete <b>-x</b> option has no effect in most contexts,
              although if it's used with <b>-t</b> it will suppress all output.  The exit status is non-zero if a  <u>name</u>
              is given, but no value, and no alias has been defined for the <u>name</u>.

       <b>autoload</b> <u>name</u> ...
              Marks  each  <u>name</u>  undefined  so  that  the  <b>FPATH</b>  variable will be searched to find the function
              definition when the function is referenced.  The same as <b>typeset</b> <b>-fu</b>.

       <b>bg</b> [ <u>job</u>... ]
              This command is only on systems that support job  control.   Puts  each  specified  <u>job</u>  into  the
              background.   The  current  job  is put in the background if <u>job</u> is not specified.  See <u>Jobs</u> for a
              description of the format of <u>job</u>.

       † <b>break</b> [ <u>n</u> ]
              Exit from the enclosing <b>for</b>, <b>while</b>, <b>until</b>, or <b>select</b> loop, if any.  If <u>n</u> is specified, then  break
              <u>n</u> levels.

       <b>builtin</b> [ <b>-ds</b> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>file</u> ] [ <u>name</u> ... ]
              If  <u>name</u>  is  not  specified, and no <b>-f</b> option is specified, the built-ins are printed on standard
              output.  The <b>-s</b> option prints only the special built-ins.  Otherwise,  each  <u>name</u>  represents  the
              pathname  whose basename is the name of the built-in.  The entry point function name is determined
              by prepending <b>b_</b> to the built-in name.  A built-in specified by a pathname will only  be  executed
              when that pathname would be found during the path search.  Built-ins found in libraries loaded via
              the <b>.paths</b> file will associate with the pathname of the directory containing the <b>.paths</b> file.

              The  ISO  C/C++  prototype  is  <b>b_</b><u>mycommand</u><b>(int</b> <u>argc</u>, <b>char</b> <b>*</b><u>argv</u><b>[]</b>, <b>void</b> <b>*</b><u>context</u><b>)</b> for the builtin
              command <u>mycommand</u> where <u>argv</u> is array an of <u>argc</u> elements and context is an optional pointer to  a
              <b>Shell_t</b> structure as described in <b>&lt;ast/shell.h&gt;</b>.

              Special  built-ins  cannot  be  bound to a pathname or deleted.  The <b>-d</b> option deletes each of the
              given built-ins.  On systems that support dynamic loading, the <b>-f</b> option names  a  shared  library
              containing  the  code for built-ins.  The shared library prefix and/or suffix, which depend on the
              system, can be omitted.  Once a library is loaded, its symbols  become  available  for  subsequent
              invocations  of  <b>builtin</b>.   Multiple  libraries  can be specified with separate invocations of the
              <b>builtin</b> command.  Libraries are searched in the reverse order in which they are specified.  When a
              library is loaded, it looks for a function in the library whose name  is  <b>lib_init()</b>  and  invokes
              this function with an argument of <b>0</b>.

       <b>cd</b> [ <b>-L</b> ] [ <b>-eP</b> ] [ <u>arg</u> ]
       <b>cd</b> [ <b>-L</b> ] [ <b>-eP</b> ] <u>old</u> <u>new</u>
              This command can be in either of two forms.  In the first form it changes the current directory to
              <u>arg</u>.   If <u>arg</u> is <b>-</b> the directory is changed to the previous directory.  The shell variable <b>HOME</b> is
              the default <u>arg</u>.  The variable <b>PWD</b> is set to the current directory.   The  shell  variable  <b>CDPATH</b>
              defines  the  search  path  for  the  directory  containing  <u>arg</u>.  Alternative directory names are
              separated by a colon  (<b>:</b>).   The  default  path  is  the  empty  string  (specifying  the  current
              directory).   Note  that  the current directory may be specified by a dot (<b>.</b>)  or by an empty path
              name, either of which can appear immediately after the equal sign or between the colon  delimiters
              anywhere  else  in  the  path  list.   If  <u>arg</u>  begins  with a <b>/</b> then the search path is not used.
              Otherwise, each directory in the path is searched for <u>arg</u>.
              The second form of <b>cd</b> substitutes the string <u>new</u> for the string <u>old</u> in the current directory name,
              <b>PWD</b>, and tries to change to this new directory.
              By default, symbolic link names are treated literally when finding the directory  name.   This  is
              equivalent  to the <b>-L</b> option.  The <b>-P</b> option causes symbolic links to be resolved when determining
              the directory.  The last instance of <b>-L</b> or <b>-P</b> on the command line determines which method is used.
              If <b>-e</b> and <b>-P</b> are both in effect and the correct <b>PWD</b> could not  be  determined  after  successfully
              changing  the  directory, <b>cd</b> will return with exit status one and produce no output.  If any other
              error occurs while both flags are active, the exit status is greater than one.
              The <b>cd</b> command may not be executed by <b>rksh.</b>

       <b>command</b> [ <b>-pvxV</b> ] <u>name</u> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              With the <b>-v</b> option, <b>command</b> is equivalent to the built-in <b>whence</b> command described below.  The  <b>-V</b>
              option causes <b>command</b> to act like <b>whence</b> <b>-v</b>.

              Without  the  <b>-v</b>  or <b>-V</b> options, <b>command</b> executes <u>name</u> with the arguments given by <u>arg</u>.  Functions
              and aliases will not be searched for when finding <u>name</u>.  If <u>name</u> refers to a special built-in,  as
              marked  with  <b>†</b>  in  this manual, <b>command</b> disables the special properties described above for that
              mark, executing the command as a regular built-in.  (For example, using <b>command</b> <b>set</b> <b>-o</b> <u>option-name</u>
              prevents a script from terminating when an invalid option name is given.)

              The <b>-p</b> option causes the operating system's standard utilities path (as output by <b>getconf</b> <b>PATH</b>) to
              be searched rather than the one defined by the value of <b>PATH</b>.

              The <b>-x</b> option searches for <u>name</u> as an external command, bypassing  built-ins.   If  the  arguments
              contain  at least one word that expands to multiple arguments, for example <b>*.txt</b> or <b>"$@"</b>, then the
              <b>-x</b> option also allows executing external commands with argument lists that  are  longer  than  the
              operating system allows. This functionality is similar to <b><a href="../man1/xargs.1.html">xargs</a></b>(1) but is easier to use. The shell
              does  this  by  invoking  the  external  command  multiple  times if needed, dividing the expanded
              argument list over the invocations. Any arguments that come before the first word that expands  to
              multiple  arguments,  as  well  as  any  that  follow  the  last  such word, are repeated for each
              invocation. This allows each invocation to use the same command  options,  as  well  as  the  same
              trailing  destination  arguments  for  commands  like  <b><a href="../man1/cp.1.html">cp</a></b>(1)  or  <b><a href="../man1/mv.1.html">mv</a></b>(1).  When all invocations are
              completed, <b>command</b> <b>-x</b> exits with the status of the invocation that had the  highest  exit  status.
              (Note  that  <b>command</b> <b>-x</b> may still fail with an "argument list too long" error if a single argument
              exceeds the maximum length of the argument list, or if a long arguments list contains no word that
              expands to multiple arguments.)

       ‡ <b>compound</b> <u>vname</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>] ...
              Causes each <u>vname</u> to be a compound variable.  The same as <b>typeset</b> <b>-C</b>.

       † <b>continue</b> [ <u>n</u> ]
              Resume the next iteration of the enclosing <b>for</b>, <b>while</b>, <b>until</b>, or <b>select</b> loop.  If <u>n</u> is  specified,
              then resume at the <u>n</u>-th enclosing loop.

       <b>disown</b> [ <u>job</u>... ]
              Causes the shell not to send a HUP signal to each given <u>job</u>, or all active jobs if <u>job</u> is omitted,
              when a login shell terminates.

       <b>echo</b> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              When  the  first  <u>arg</u>  does  not  begin with a -, and none of the arguments contain a \, then <b>echo</b>
              prints each of its arguments separated by a space and terminated by a  new-line.   Otherwise,  the
              behavior  of  <b>echo</b>  is  system  dependent and <b>print</b> or <b>printf</b> described below should be used.  See
              <u><a href="../man1/echo.1.html">echo</a></u>(1) for usage and description.

       ‡ <b>enum</b> [ <b>-i</b> ] <u>type</u>[=(<u>value</u> ...) ] ...
              Creates, for each <u>type</u> specified, an enumeration type declaration command named  <u>type</u>.   Variables
              of  the  created  type  can only store any one of the <u>value</u>s given.  For example, <b>enum</b> <b>bool=(false</b>
              <b>true)</b> creates a Boolean variable type of which variables may be declared like <b>bool</b> <b>x=true</b> <b>y=false</b>.
              If <b>=(</b><u>value</u> <u>...</u><b>)</b> is omitted, then <u>type</u> must be an indexed array variable with at least two elements
              and the values are taken from this array variable.  If  <b>-i</b>  is  specified  the  values  are  case-
              insensitive.   Declaration  commands  are  created  as  special builtins that cannot be removed or
              overridden by shell functions.  Each created declaration command has a  <b>--man</b>  option  that  shows
              documentation on its type's behavior and possible values.

              Within arithmetic expressions (see <u>Arithmetic</u> <u>Evaluation</u> above), enumeration type values translate
              to  index  numbers  between  0  and  the  number  of defined values minus 1. It is an error for an
              arithmetic expression to assign a value outside of that  range.  Decimal  fractions  are  ignored.
              Taking  the  <b>bool</b> type from the example above, if a variable of this type is used in an arithmetic
              expression, <b>false</b> translates to 0 and <b>true</b> to 1.  Enumeration values may also be used directly  in
              an  arithmetic  expression  that  refers  to  a  variable of an enumeration type.  To continue our
              example, for a <b>bool</b> variable <b>v</b>, <b>((v==true))</b> is the same as <b>((v==1))</b> and if a variable  named  <b>true</b>
              exists, it is ignored.

       † <b>eval</b> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              The arguments are read as input to the shell and the resulting command(s) executed.

       † <b>exec</b> [ <b>-c</b> ] [ <b>-a</b> <u>name</u> ] [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              If  <u>arg</u>  is  given,  the  command  specified  by the arguments is seaerched on PATH as an external
              command and executed in place of the current shell without creating a new process.  The  value  of
              the  <b>SHLVL</b> environment variable is decreased by one, unless the shell replaced is a subshell.  The
              <b>-c</b> option causes the environment to be cleared before  applying  variable  assignments  associated
              with  the <b>exec</b> invocation.  The <b>-a</b> option causes <u>name</u> rather than the first <u>arg</u>, to become <b>argv[0]</b>
              for the new process.  If <u>arg</u> is not given and only I/O redirections are given, then  this  command
              persistently modifies file descriptors as in <b>redirect.</b>

       † <b>exit</b> [ <u>n</u> ]
              Causes  the  shell  to  exit  with  the  exit  status specified by <u>n</u>.  The value will be the least
              significant 8 bits of <u>n</u> (if specified) or of the exit status of the  last  command  executed.   An
              end-of-file  will  also  cause  the  shell  to  exit, except for an interactive shell that has the
              <b>ignoreeof</b> option turned on (see <b>set</b> below).

       †‡ <b>export</b> [ <b>-p</b> ] [ <u>name</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>] ] ...
              If <u>name</u> is not given, the names and values of each variable with the export attribute are  printed
              with  the  values  quoted  in a manner that allows them to be re-input.  The <b>export</b> command is the
              same as <b>typeset</b> <b>-x</b> except that if you use <b>export</b> within a function, no local variable is  created.
              The  <b>-p</b>  option causes the word <b>export</b> to be inserted before each one.  Otherwise, the given <u>name</u>s
              are marked for automatic export to the <u>environment</u> of subsequently-executed commands.

       <b>false</b>  Does nothing, and exits 1. Used with <b>until</b> for infinite loops.

       <b>fc</b> [ <b>-e</b> <u>ename</u>  ] [ <b>-N</b> <u>num</u> ] [ <b>-nlr</b> ] [ <u>first</u> [ <u>last</u> ] ]
       <b>fc</b> <b>-s</b>  [ <u>old</u><b>=</b><u>new</u> ] [ <u>command</u> ]
              The same as <b>hist</b>.

       <b>fg</b> [ <u>job</u>... ]
              This command is only on systems that support job control.  Each <u>job</u> specified is  brought  to  the
              foreground  and waited for in the specified order.  Otherwise, the current job is brought into the
              foreground.  See <u>Jobs</u> for a description of the format of <u>job</u>.

       ‡ <b>float</b> <u>vname</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>] ...
              Declares each <u>vname</u> to be a long floating point number.  The same as <b>typeset</b> <b>-lE</b>.

       <b>functions</b> [ <b>-Stux</b> ] [ <u>name</u> ... ]
              Lists functions.  The same as <b>typeset</b> <b>-f</b>.

       <b>getconf</b> [ <u>name</u> [ <u>pathname</u> ] ]
              Prints the current value  of  the  configuration  parameter  given  by  <u>name</u>.   The  configuration
              parameters are defined by the IEEE POSIX 1003.1 and IEEE POSIX 1003.2 standards.  (See <u><a href="../man2/pathconf.2.html">pathconf</a></u>(2)
              and  <u><a href="../man3/sysconf.3.html">sysconf</a></u>(3).)   The  <u>pathname</u>  argument  is required for parameters whose value depends on the
              location in the file system.  If no arguments are given, <b>getconf</b> prints the names  and  values  of
              the  current  configuration  parameters.   The  pathname <b>/</b> is used for each of the parameters that
              requires <u>pathname</u>.

       <b>getopts</b> [ <b>-a</b> <u>name</u> ] <u>optstring</u> <u>vname</u> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              Checks <u>arg</u> for legal options.  If <u>arg</u> is omitted, the positional parameters are used.   An  option
              argument  begins with a <b>+</b> or a <b>-</b>.  An option not beginning with <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> or the argument <b>--</b> ends the
              options.  Options beginning with <b>+</b> are only recognized when <u>optstring</u> begins with a <b>+</b>.   <u>optstring</u>
              contains  the  letters  that  <b>getopts</b>  recognizes.  If a letter is followed by a <b>:</b>, that option is
              expected to have an argument.  The options can be separated from  the  argument  by  blanks.   The
              option  <b>-?</b>   causes <b>getopts</b> to generate a usage message on standard error.  The <b>-a</b> argument can be
              used to specify the name to use for the usage message, which defaults to <b>$0</b>.
              <b>getopts</b> places the next option letter it finds inside variable <u>vname</u> each time it is invoked.  The
              option letter will be prepended with a <b>+</b> when <u>arg</u> begins with a <b>+</b>.  The index of the next  <u>arg</u>  is
              stored in <b>OPTIND</b>.  The option argument, if any, gets stored in <b>OPTARG</b>.
              A leading <b>:</b> in <u>optstring</u> causes <b>getopts</b> to store the letter of an invalid option in <b>OPTARG</b>, and to
              set  <u>vname</u>  to  <b>?</b>   for  an  unknown  option  and to <b>:</b> when a required option argument is missing.
              Otherwise, <b>getopts</b> prints an error message.  The exit status is non-zero when there  are  no  more
              options.
              There  is  no  way  to  specify any of the options <b>:</b>, <b>+</b>, <b>-</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>[</b>, and <b>]</b>.  The option <b>#</b> can only be
              specified as the first option.

       <b>hash</b> [ <b>-r</b> ] [ <u>utility</u> ... ]
              <b>hash</b> displays or modifies the hash table with the locations of recently used programs. If given no
              arguments, it lists all command/path associations (a.k.a. 'tracked aliases') in  the  hash  table.
              Otherwise,  <b>hash</b>  performs a <b>PATH</b> search for each <u>utility</u> supplied and adds the result to the hash
              table.  Any <u>utility</u> that is not found is silently ignored.  The <b>-r</b> option empties the hash  table.
              This can also be achieved by resetting <b>PATH.</b>

       <b>hist</b> [ <b>-e</b> <u>ename</u>  ] [ <b>-N</b> <u>num</u> ] [ <b>-nlr</b> ] [ <u>first</u> [ <u>last</u> ] ]
       <b>hist</b> <b>-s</b> [ <u>old</u><b>=</b><u>new</u> ] [ <u>command</u> ]
              In  the  first  form,  a  range  of commands from <u>first</u> to <u>last</u> is selected from the last <b>HISTSIZE</b>
              commands that were typed at the terminal.  The arguments <u>first</u> and <u>last</u>  may  be  specified  as  a
              number or as a string.  A string is used to locate the most recent command starting with the given
              string.   A  negative number is used as an offset to the current command number.  If the <b>-l</b> option
              is selected, the commands are listed on standard output.  Otherwise, the editor program  <u>ename</u>  is
              invoked on a file containing these keyboard commands.  If <u>ename</u> is not supplied, then the value of
              the  variable  <b>HISTEDIT</b> is used.  If <b>HISTEDIT</b> is not set, then <b>FCEDIT</b> (default <b><a href="file:/bin/ed">/bin/ed</a></b>) is used as
              the editor.  When editing is complete, the edited command(s) is executed if the changes have  been
              saved.   If  <u>last</u>  is not specified, then it will be set to <u>first</u>.  If <u>first</u> is not specified, the
              default is the previous command for editing and -16 for listing.  The option <b>-r</b> reverses the order
              of the commands and the option <b>-n</b> suppresses command numbers when listing.  In  the  second  form,
              <u>command</u>  is  interpreted  as <u>first</u> described above and defaults to the last command executed.  The
              resulting command is executed after the optional substitution <u>old</u><b>=</b><u>new</u> is performed.  The option <b>-N</b>
              causes <b>hist</b> to start <u>num</u> commands back.

       ‡ <b>integer</b> <u>vname</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>] ...
              Declares each <u>vname</u> to be a long integer number.  The same as <b>typeset</b> <b>-li</b>.

       <b>jobs</b> [ <b>-lnp</b> ] [ <u>job</u> ... ]
              Lists information about each given job; or all active jobs if <u>job</u> is omitted.  The <b>-l</b> option lists
              process IDs in addition to the normal information.  The <b>-n</b> option only  displays  jobs  that  have
              stopped  or exited since last notified.  The <b>-p</b> option causes only the process group to be listed.
              See <u>Jobs</u> for a description of the format of <u>job</u>.

       <b>kill</b> [ <b>-s</b> <u>signame</u> ] <u>job</u> ...
       <b>kill</b> [ <b>-n</b> <u>signum</u> ] <u>job</u> ...
       <b>kill</b> <b>-Ll</b> [ <u>sig</u> ... ]
              Sends either the TERM (terminate) signal  or  the  specified  signal  to  the  specified  jobs  or
              processes.   Signals  are  either given by number with the <b>-n</b> option or by name with the <b>-s</b> option
              (as given in <b>&lt;signal.h&gt;</b>, stripped of the prefix ``SIG''.  For backward compatibility, the <b>n</b> and  <b>s</b>
              can be omitted and the number or name placed immediately after the <b>-</b>.  If the signal being sent is
              TERM  (terminate) or HUP (hangup), and the <b>posix</b> shell option is off, then the job or process will
              be sent a CONT (continue) signal if it is stopped.  The argument <u>job</u> can be the process  ID  of  a
              process  that is not a member of one of the active jobs.  See <u>Jobs</u> for a description of the format
              of <u>job</u>.  In the third form, <b>kill</b> <b>-l</b> or <b>kill</b> <b>-L</b>, if <u>sig</u> is not  specified,  the  signal  names  are
              listed.   The  <b>-l</b>  option  lists  only the signal names.  The <b>-L</b> option lists each signal name and
              corresponding number.  Otherwise, for each <u>sig</u> that is a name, the corresponding signal number  is
              listed.   For  each <u>sig</u> that is a number, the signal name corresponding to the least significant 8
              bits of <u>sig</u> is listed.

       <b>let</b> <u>arg</u> ...
              Each <u>arg</u> is a separate <u>arithmetic</u> <u>expression</u> to be evaluated.  <b>let</b> only recognizes  octal  numbers
              starting  with  <b>0</b>  when  the  <b>set</b>  option  <b>letoctal</b>  is on.  See <u>Arithmetic</u> <u>Evaluation</u> above for a
              description of arithmetic expression evaluation.
              The exit status is 0 if the value of the last expression is non-zero, and 1 otherwise.

       ‡ <b>nameref</b> <u>vname</u>[<b>=</b><u>refname</u>] ...
              Declares each <u>vname</u> to be a variable name reference.  The same as <b>typeset</b> <b>-n</b>.

       <b>print</b> [ <b>-CRenprsv</b> ] [ <b>-u</b> <u>unit</u> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>format</u> ] [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              With no options or with option <b>-</b> or <b>--</b>, each <u>arg</u> is printed on standard  output.   The  <b>-f</b>  option
              causes  the  arguments to be printed as described by <b>printf</b>.  In this case, any <b>e</b>, <b>n</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>R</b> options
              are ignored.  Otherwise, unless the <b>-C</b>,  <b>-R</b>,  <b>-r</b>,  or  <b>-v</b>  are  specified,  the  following  escape
              conventions will be applied:
              <b>\a</b>     The alert character (ASCII <b>07</b>).
              <b>\b</b>     The backspace character (ASCII <b>010</b>).
              <b>\c</b>     Causes <b>print</b> to end without processing more arguments and not adding a new-line.
              <b>\f</b>     The formfeed character (ASCII <b>014</b>).
              <b>\n</b>     The newline character (ASCII <b>012</b>).
              <b>\r</b>     The carriage return character (ASCII <b>015</b>).
              <b>\t</b>     The tab character (ASCII <b>011</b>).
              <b>\v</b>     The vertical tab character (ASCII <b>013</b>).
              <b>\E</b>     The escape character (ASCII <b>033</b>).
              <b>\\</b>     The backslash character \.
              <b>\0</b><u>x</u>    The character defined by the 1, 2, or 3-digit octal string given by <u>x</u>.

              The  <b>-R</b>  option  will print all subsequent arguments and options other than <b>-n</b>.  The <b>-e</b> causes the
              above escape conventions to be applied.  This is the default behavior.  It reverses the effect  of
              an  earlier  <b>-r</b>.   The  <b>-p</b>  option causes the arguments to be written onto the pipe of the process
              spawned with <b>|&amp;</b> instead of standard output.  The <b>-v</b> option treats each <u>arg</u> as a variable name  and
              writes  the  value  in the <b>printf</b> <b>%B</b> format.  The <b>-C</b> option treats each <u>arg</u> as a variable name and
              writes the value in the <b>printf</b> <b>%#B</b> format.  The <b>-s</b> option causes the arguments to be written  onto
              the  history  file  instead  of standard output.  The <b>-u</b> option can be used to specify a one digit
              file descriptor unit number <u>unit</u> on which the output will be placed.  The default is  1.   If  the
              option <b>-n</b> is used, no <b>new-line</b> is added to the output.

       <b>printf</b> [ <b>-v</b> <u>vname</u> ] <u>format</u> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              The  arguments  <u>arg</u>  are printed on standard output in accordance with the ANSI C formatting rules
              associated with the format string <u>format</u>.  If the number of arguments exceeds the number of format
              specifications, the <b>format</b>  string  is  reused  to  format  remaining  arguments.   The  following
              extensions can also be used:
              <b>%b</b>     A <b>%b</b> format can be used instead of <b>%s</b> to cause escape sequences in the corresponding <u>arg</u> to
                     be expanded as described in <b>print.</b>
              <b>%B</b>     A  <b>%B</b>  option  causes  each of the arguments to be treated as variable names and the binary
                     value of variable will be printed.  The alternate flag <b>#</b> causes a compound variable  to  be
                     output  on  a  single line.  This is most useful for compound variables and variables whose
                     attribute is <b>-b</b>.
              <b>%H</b>     A <b>%H</b> format can be used instead of <b>%s</b> to cause characters in <u>arg</u> that are special  in  HTML
                     and XML to be output as their entity name.  The alternate flag <b>#</b> formats the output for use
                     as a URI.
              <b>%p</b>     A <b>%p</b> format will convert the given number to hexadecimal.
              <b>%P</b>     A <b>%P</b> format can be used instead of <b>%s</b> to cause <u>arg</u> to be interpreted as an extended regular
                     expression and be printed as a shell pattern.
              <b>%q</b>     A  <b>%q</b>  format  can  be  used  instead of <b>%s</b> to cause the resulting string to be quoted in a
                     manner than can be reinput to the shell.  When <b>q</b> is  preceded  by  the  alternative  format
                     specifier, <b>#</b>, the string is quoted in manner suitable as a field in a <b>.csv</b> format file.
              <b>%(</b><u>date-format</u><b>)T</b>
                     A  <b>%(</b><u>date-format</u><b>)T</b>  format  can  be  used to treat an argument as a date/time string and to
                     format the date/time according to the <u>date-format</u>.
              <b>%Q</b>     A <b>%Q</b> format will convert the given number of seconds to readable time.
              <b>%R</b>     A <b>%R</b> format can be used instead of <b>%s</b> to cause <u>arg</u> to be interpreted as a shell pattern and
                     to be printed as an extended regular expression.
              <b>%Z</b>     A <b>%Z</b> format will output a byte whose value is 0.
              <b>%d</b>     The precision field of the <b>%d</b> format can be followed by a <b>.</b>  and the output base.  In  this
                     case,  the <b>#</b> flag character causes <u>base</u><b>#</b> to be prepended.  When an output base is specified
                     without giving a precision (e.g.  <b>%..2d</b>), the precision defaults to 1 instead of 0.
              <b>#</b>      The <b>#</b> flag, when used with the <b>%d</b> format without an output base,  displays  the  output  in
                     powers  of 1000 indicated by one of the following suffixes: <b>k</b> <b>M</b> <b>G</b> <b>T</b> <b>P</b> <b>E</b>, and when used with
                     the <b>%i</b> format displays the output in powers of 1024  indicated  by  one  of  the  following
                     suffixes: <b>Ki</b> <b>Mi</b> <b>Gi</b> <b>Ti</b> <b>Pi</b> <b>Ei</b>.
              <b>=</b>      The <b>=</b> flag centers the output within the specified field width.
              <b>L</b>      The  <b>L</b>  flag,  when  used  with  the  <b>%c</b> or <b>%s</b> formats, treats precision as character width
                     instead of byte count.
              <b>,</b>      The <b>,</b> flag, when used with the <b>%d</b> or <b>%f</b>  formats,  separates  groups  of  digits  with  the
                     grouping delimiter (<b>,</b> on groups of 3 in the C locale).

              The  <b>-v</b> option assigns the output directly to a variable instead of writing it to standard output.
              This is faster than capturing the output using a command  substitution  and  avoids  the  latter's
              stripping  of  final linefeed characters (<b>\n</b>). The <u>vname</u> argument should be a valid variable name,
              optionally with one or more array subscripts in square brackets.  Note that square brackets should
              be quoted to avoid pathname expansion.

              On some systems, the external <b><a href="../man1/printf.1.html">printf</a></b>(1) command allows the  <u>format</u>  operand  to  begin  with  a  <b>-</b>
              without  any  preceding  <b>--</b>  option  terminator  argument  for compatibility with ancient scripts,
              provided no options are given.  On such systems, <b>ksh</b>'s built-in <b>printf</b> may have been built  to  be
              as  compatible  with this as possible while still allowing its options to be usable.  However, the
              POSIX standard requires adding the  preceding  <b>--</b>  to  keep  such  a  <u>format</u>  operand  from  being
              misinterpreted  as  options.   The  obsolete  syntax  is not portable and should be avoided in new
              scripts.

       <b>pwd</b> [ <b>-LP</b> ]
              Outputs the value of the current working directory.  The <b>-L</b> option is the default; it  prints  the
              logical name of the current directory.  If the <b>-P</b> option is given, all symbolic links are resolved
              from the name.  The last instance of <b>-L</b> or <b>-P</b> on the command line determines which method is used.

       <b>read</b> [ <b>-ACSaprsv</b> ] [ <b>-d</b> <u>delim</u> ] [ <b>-n</b> <u>n</u> ] [ <b>-N</b> <u>n</u> ] [ <b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u> ] [ <b>-u</b> <u>unit</u> ] [ <u>vname</u><b>?</b><u>prompt</u> ] [ <u>vname</u> ...
       ]
              The  shell input mechanism.  One line is read and is broken up into fields using the characters in
              <b>IFS</b> as separators.  The escape character, <b>\</b>, is used to remove any special meaning  for  the  next
              character  and  for line continuation.  The first field is assigned to the first <u>vname</u>, the second
              field to the second <u>vname</u>, etc., with leftover fields assigned to the last  <u>vname</u>.   If  <u>vname</u>  is
              omitted,  then  <b>REPLY</b> is used as the default <u>vname</u>.  When <u>vname</u> has the binary attribute and <b>-n</b> or
              <b>-N</b> is specified, the bytes that are read are stored directly into the  variable.   If  you  append
              <b>?</b><u>prompt</u>  to  the  first  <u>vname</u>,  then <b>read</b> will display <u>prompt</u> on standard error before reading if
              standard input is a terminal or pipe;  the  <b>?</b>  should  be  quoted  to  protect  it  from  pathname
              expansion.   The exit status is 0 unless an end-of-file is encountered or <b>read</b> has timed out.  The
              options for the <b>read</b> command have meaning as follows:
              <b>-A</b>      Causes the variable <u>vname</u> to be unset and  each  field  that  is  read  to  be  stored  in
                      successive elements of the indexed array <u>vname.</u>
              <b>-C</b>      Causes  the variable <u>vname</u> to be read as a compound variable.  Blanks will be ignored when
                      finding the beginning open parenthesis.
              <b>-N</b>      Causes <u>n</u> bytes to be read unless an end-of-file has been encountered or the read times out
                      because of the <b>-t</b> option.
              <b>-S</b>      Causes the line to be treated like a record in a <b>.csv</b> format file so  that  double  quotes
                      can be used to allow the delimiter character and the new-line character to appear within a
                      field.
              <b>-a</b>      Same as <b>-A</b>.
              <b>-d</b>      Causes the read to continue to the first character of <u>delim</u> instead of the newline control
                      character.  Multibyte characters for <u>delim</u> are not supported.
              <b>-n</b>      Causes  at  most  <u>n</u>  bytes to be read instead of a full line, but will return when reading
                      from a slow device as soon as any characters have been read.
              <b>-p</b>      Input is read from the current co-process spawned by the shell using <b>⎪&amp;</b>.   An  end-of-file
                      causes <b>read</b> to disconnect the co-process so that another can be created.
              <b>-r</b>      Raw mode. The <b>\</b> character is not treated specially.
              <b>-s</b>      The input will be saved as a command in the history file.
              <b>-t</b>      Used to specify a timeout in seconds when reading from a terminal or pipe.
              <b>-u</b>      This  option  can  be  used to specify a one-digit file descriptor unit <u>unit</u> to read from.
                      The file descriptor can be opened with the <b>exec</b> or <b>redirect</b> built-in command.  If <u>unit</u>  is
                      <b>p</b>,  input is read from the current co-process as with the <b>-p</b> option.  The default value of
                      <u>unit</u> is 0.
              <b>-v</b>      The value of the first <u>vname</u> will be used as a default value when reading from a  terminal
                      device.

       †‡ <b>readonly</b> [ <b>-p</b> ] [ <u>vname</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>] ] ...
              If  <u>vname</u>  is  not  given,  the  names and values of each variable with the read-only attribute is
              printed with the values quoted in a manner that allows them to be re-input.  The <b>-p</b> option  causes
              the  word  <b>readonly</b>  to be inserted before each one.  Otherwise, the given <u>vname</u>s are marked read-
              only and these names cannot be changed by subsequent assignment.   Unlike  <b>typeset</b> <b>-r</b>  <b>,</b>  <b>readonly</b>
              does  not  create  a  function-local  scope  and the given <u>vname</u>s are marked globally read-only by
              default.  When defining a type, if the value of a read-only subvariable is not defined, the  value
              is required when creating each instance.

       <b>redirect</b>
              This  command only accepts input/output redirections.  It can open and close files and modify file
              descriptors from <b>0</b> to <b>9</b> as specified by the input/output redirection list  (see  the  <u>Input/Output</u>
              section  above),  with  the difference that the effect persists past the execution of the <b>redirect</b>
              command.  When invoking another program, file descriptors greater than <b>2</b>  that  were  opened  with
              this  mechanism  are only passed on if they are explicitly redirected to themselves as part of the
              invocation (e.g. <b>4&gt;&amp;4</b>) or if the <b>posix</b> option is set.

       † <b>return</b> [ <u>n</u> ]
              Causes a shell function, dot script (see <b>.</b> and  <b>source</b>),  or  profile  script  to  return  to  the
              invoking  shell  environment  with  the exit status specified by <u>n</u>.  This status value can use the
              full signed integer range as shown by the commands <b>getconf</b> <b>INT_MIN</b> and <b>getconf</b>  <b>INT_MAX</b>.  A  value
              outside  that  range  will produce a warning and an exit status of 128.  If <u>n</u> is omitted, then the
              value of <b>$?</b> is assumed, i.e., the exit status of the last  command  executed  is  passed  on.   If
              <b>return</b> is invoked while not in a function, dot script, or profile script, then it behaves the same
              as <b>exit</b>.

       † <b>set</b> [ <b>±BCGHabefhkmnprstuvx</b> ] [ <b>±o</b> [ <u>option</u> ] ] ... [ <b>±A</b> <u>vname</u> ]  [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              The options for this command have meaning as follows:
              <b>-A</b>      Array  assignment.   Unset  the variable <u>vname</u> and assign values sequentially from the <u>arg</u>
                      list.  If <b>+A</b> is used, the variable <u>vname</u> is not unset first.
              <b>-B</b>      Enable brace group expansion. On by default, except if ksh is invoked as <b>sh</b> or <b>rsh</b>.
              <b>-C</b>      Prevents redirection <b>&gt;</b> from truncating existing files.  Files that are created are  opened
                      with the O_EXCL mode.  Requires <b>&gt;|</b> to truncate a file when turned on.
              <b>-G</b>      Enables  recursive  pathname  expansion.   This  adds  the  double-star  pattern <b>**</b> to the
                      pathname expansion (see <u>Pathname</u> <u>Expansion</u> above).  By itself, it  matches  the  recursive
                      contents  of  the  current  directory,  which  is to say, all files and directories in the
                      current directory and in all its subdirectories, sub-subdirectories, and so  on.   If  the
                      pathname  pattern  ends in <b>**/</b>, only directories and subdirectories are matched, including
                      symbolic links that point to directories.  A prefixed directory name is  not  included  in
                      the  results  unless  that  directory  was  itself found by a pattern. For example, <b>dir/**</b>
                      matches the recursive contents of <b>dir</b> but not <b>dir</b> itself, whereas  <b>di[r]/**</b>  matches  both
                      <b>dir</b>  itself  and the recursive contents of <b>dir</b>.  Symbolic links to non-directories are not
                      followed.  Symbolic links to directories are followed if they are specified  literally  or
                      match  a  pattern  as  described  under  <u>Pathname</u> <u>Expansion</u>, but not if they result from a
                      double-star pattern.
              <b>-H</b>      Enable <b>!</b>-style history expansion similar to <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1).  See <u>History</u> <u>Expansion</u> above.
              <b>-a</b>      All variables that are assigned  a  value  while  this  option  is  on  are  automatically
                      exported,  unless they have a dot in their name.  Variables created in namespaces declared
                      with the <b>namespace</b> keyword (see <u>Name</u> <u>Spaces</u> above) are  only  exported  while  their  name
                      space is active.
              <b>-b</b>      Prints  job  completion  messages  as  soon  as a background job changes state rather than
                      waiting for the next prompt.  If one of the shell line editors  is  in  use  (see  <u>In-line</u>
                      <u>Editing</u> <u>Options</u> above), the completion message is inserted directly above the command line
                      being typed.
              <b>-e</b>      Unless  contained  in  a  <b>||</b>  or <b>&amp;&amp;</b> command, or the command following an <b>if</b> <b>while</b> or <b>until</b>
                      command or in the pipeline following <b>!</b>, if a command has a non-zero exit  status,  execute
                      the <b>ERR</b> trap, if set, and exit.  This mode is disabled while reading profiles.
              <b>-f</b>      Disables pathname expansion.
              <b>-h</b>      Obsolete; no effect.
              <b>-k</b>      All  variable  assignment  arguments are placed in the environment for a command, not just
                      those that precede the command name.
              <b>-m</b>      Background jobs will run  in  a  separate  process  group  and  a  line  will  print  upon
                      completion.   The  exit  status of background jobs is reported in a completion message.  A
                      pipeline will not terminate until all component commands of the pipeline have  terminated.
                      On  systems  with  job  control,  this  option  is turned on automatically for interactive
                      shells.
              <b>-n</b>      Read commands and check them for syntax errors, but do  not  execute  them.   Ignored  for
                      interactive shells.
              <b>-o</b>      The following argument can be one of the following option names:
                      <b>allexport</b>
                              Same as <b>-a</b>.
                      <b>backslashctrl</b>
                              The backslash character <b>\</b> escapes the next control character in the <b>emacs</b> built-in
                              editor  and  the  next  <u>erase</u>  or <u>kill</u> character in the <b>vi</b> built-in editor.  On by
                              default.
                      <b>bgnice</b>  All background jobs are run at a lower priority.  This is the default mode.
                      <b>braceexpand</b>
                              Same as <b>-B</b>.
                      <b>emacs</b>   Activates the <u>emacs</u>-style command line editor.  See <u>Emacs</u> <u>Editing</u> <u>Mode</u> above.
                      <b>errexit</b> Same as <b>-e</b>.
                      <b>functrace</b>
                              Causes the <b>-x</b> option's state  and  the  <b>DEBUG</b>  trap  action  to  be  inherited  by
                              functions  defined  using  the  <b>function</b>  keyword (see <u>Functions</u> above) instead of
                              being reset to default.  Changes made to them within the function do not propagate
                              back to the parent scope.  Similarly, this  option  also  causes  the  <b>DEBUG</b>  trap
                              action to be inherited by subshells.
                      <b>globcasedetect</b>
                              When  this  option  is turned on, globbing (see <u>Pathname</u> <u>Expansion</u> above) and file
                              name listing and completion (see  <u>In-line</u>  <u>Editing</u>  <u>Options</u>  above)  automatically
                              become  case-insensitive  on  file systems where the difference between upper- and
                              lowercase is ignored for file names. This is  transparently  determined  for  each
                              directory,  so  a  path pattern that spans multiple file systems can be part case-
                              sensitive and part case-insensitive.  In more precise terms, each  slash-separated
                              path  name component pattern <u>p</u> is treated as <b>~(i:</b><u>p</u><b>)</b> if its parent directory exists
                              on a case-insensitive file system.  This  option  is  only  present  on  operating
                              systems that support case-insensitive file systems.
                      <b>globstar</b>
                              Same as <b>-G</b>.
                      <b>gmacs</b>   Activates the <u>emacs</u>-style command line editor with modified <b>^T</b>.  See <u>Emacs</u> <u>Editing</u>
                              <u>Mode</u> above.
                      <b>histexpand</b>
                              Same as <b>-H</b>.
                      <b>histreedit</b>
                              If  a history expansion (see <b>-H</b>) fails, the command line is reloaded into the next
                              prompt's edit buffer, allowing corrections.
                      <b>histverify</b>
                              The results of  a  history  expansion  (see  <b>-H</b>)  are  not  immediately  executed.
                              Instead,  the expanded line is loaded into the next prompt's edit buffer, allowing
                              further changes.
                      <b>ignoreeof</b>
                              An interactive shell will not exit on end-of-file.  The command <b>exit</b> must be used.
                      <b>keyword</b> Same as <b>-k</b>.
                      <b>letoctal</b>
                              The <b>let</b> command allows octal numbers starting with <b>0</b>.  On by  default  if  ksh  is
                              invoked as <b>sh</b> or <b>rsh</b>.
                      <b>markdirs</b>
                              All directory names resulting from pathname expansion have a trailing <b>/</b> appended.
                      <b>monitor</b> Same as <b>-m</b>.
                      <b>multiline</b>
                              The  built-in  editors  will  use  multiple lines on the screen for lines that are
                              longer than the width of the screen.  This may not work for  all  terminals.   The
                              shell  uses the system default <b><a href="../man1/tput.1.html">tput</a></b>(1) command to obtain the terminal escape codes
                              for the necessary operations.  Multi-line editing is disabled if this  fails.   On
                              most  systems,  setting the <b>TERM</b> variable to your terminal's type and exporting it
                              corrects this situation.  The <b>multiline</b> option is  ineffectual  on  systems  whose
                              <b><a href="../man1/tput.1.html">tput</a></b>(1) command supports neither <b><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></b>(5) nor <b><a href="../man5/termcap.5.html">termcap</a></b>(5) capability names.
                      <b>noclobber</b>
                              Same as <b>-C</b>.
                      <b>noexec</b>  Same as <b>-n</b>.
                      <b>noglob</b>  Same as <b>-f</b>.
                      <b>nolog</b>   Obsolete; has no effect.
                      <b>notify</b>  Same as <b>-b</b>.
                      <b>nounset</b> Same as <b>-u</b>.
                      <b>pipefail</b>
                              The  exit status of the entire pipeline will be that of the last component command
                              that exited with a non-zero exit status, or zero if no command exited with a  non-
                              zero  exit status.  The shell will wait for all component commands of the pipeline
                              to terminate, instead of only waiting for the last component command.
                      <b>posix</b>   Enables the POSIX standard mode for maximum  compatibility  with  other  compliant
                              shells.  At  the  moment  that  the  <b>posix</b>  option  is turned on, it also turns on
                              <b>letoctal</b> and turns off <b>-B</b>/<b>braceexpand</b>; the reverse is done when  <b>posix</b>  is  turned
                              back  off.  (These  options  can  still  be  controlled independently in between.)
                              Furthermore, the <b>posix</b> option is automatically turned on upon  invocation  if  the
                              shell is invoked as <b>sh</b> or <b>rsh</b>, or if <b>-o</b> <b>posix</b> or <b>--posix</b> is specified on the shell
                              invocation  command  line,  or  when executing scripts without a <b>#!</b> path with this
                              option active in the invoking shell. In that case,  the  invoked  shell  will  not
                              import  type attributes for variables (such as integer or left/right justify) from
                              the environment.
                              In addition, while on, the <b>posix</b> option
                              •  disables exporting variable type attributes to the environment  for  other  ksh
                                 processes to import;
                              •  disallows  brace  expansion  on  the  results  of  unquoted  expansions (if the
                                 <b>-B</b>/<b>braceexpand</b> option is turned back on);
                              •  disables the special handling of repeated <u>isspace</u> class characters in  the  <b>IFS</b>
                                 variable;
                              •  causes <b>redirect</b> and <b>exec</b> to open file descriptors &gt; 2 without the close-on-exec
                                 flag, so that they are left open when invoking another program;
                              •  disables the <b>&amp;&gt;</b> redirection shorthand;
                              •  disables fast filescan loops of type <b>while</b> <u>inputredirection</u> <b>;do</b> <u>list</u> <b>;done</b>;
                              •  makes  the  <b>&lt;&gt;</b> redirection operator default to redirecting standard input if no
                                 file descriptor number precedes it;
                              •  causes the shell to use a standard UNIX <u><a href="../man2/pipe.2.html">pipe</a></u>(2) instead of a  <u><a href="../man2/socketpair.2.html">socketpair</a></u>(2)  to
                                 connect  commands  in  a  pipeline  (when reading directly from a pipeline, the
                                 <b>&lt;#</b><u>pattern</u> and <b>&lt;##</b><u>pattern</u> redirection operators will not work and the <b>-n</b>  option
                                 to the <b>read</b> built-in will not return early when reading from a slow device);
                              •  disables  the  special  floating  point  constants  <b>Inf</b>  and  <b>NaN</b> in arithmetic
                                 evaluation so that, e.g., <b>$((inf))</b> and <b>$((nan))</b> refer to the variables by those
                                 names;
                              •  enables the recognition of a leading zero as introducing an octal number in all
                                 arithmetic evaluation contexts, except in the <b>let</b> built-in  while  <b>letoctal</b>  is
                                 off;
                              •  disables zero-padding of seconds in the output of the <b>time</b> and <b>times</b> built-ins;
                              •  stops the <b>.</b> command (but not <b>source</b>) from looking up functions defined with the
                                 <b>function</b> syntax;
                              •  disables  the  recognition  of  unexpanded shell arithmetic expressions for the
                                 numerical conversion specifiers of the <b>printf</b> built-in command, causing them to
                                 print  a  warning  for  operands  that  are  not  valid  decimal,   <b>0x</b>-prefixed
                                 hexadecimal or <b>0</b>-prefixed octal numbers;
                              •  stops  the  <b>kill</b>  built-in  command from automatically sending a <b>CONT</b> signal to
                                 stopped jobs or processes upon sending a <b>HUP</b> or <b>TERM</b> signal;
                              •  disables the special handling of <b><a href="file:/dev/fd/">/dev/fd/</a></b><u>n</u> in file existence  and  access  test
                                 operators  in  <b>test</b>/<b>[</b> and <b>[[</b>, causing these to operate on the file <b><a href="file:/dev/fd/">/dev/fd/</a></b><u>n</u> in
                                 the file system;
                              •  disables the recognition of unexpanded  shell  arithmetic  expressions  in  the
                                 numerical  comparison  operators  <b>-eq</b>, <b>-ne</b>, <b>-gt</b>, <b>-ge</b>, <b>-lt</b> and <b>-le</b> of the <b>test</b>/<b>[</b>
                                 built-in command, causing them to accept only decimal numbers as operands;
                              •  changes the <b>test</b>/<b>[</b> built-in command to make its deprecated <u>expr1</u> <b>-a</b>  <u>expr2</u>  and
                                 <u>expr1</u>  <b>-o</b> <u>expr2</u> operators work even if <u>expr1</u> equals "<b>!</b>" or "<b>(</b>" (which means the

                                 using <b>!</b> or wrapped in parentheses); and
                              •  disables a hack that makes <b>test</b> <b>-t</b> (<b>[</b> <b>-t</b> <b>]</b>) equivalent to <b>test</b> <b>-t</b> <b>1</b> (<b>[</b> <b>-t</b> <b>1</b> <b>]</b>).
                      <b>privileged</b>
                              Same as <b>-p</b>.
                      <b>showme</b>  When  enabled,  simple  commands  or pipelines preceded by a semicolon (<b>;</b>) will be
                              displayed as if  the  <b>xtrace</b>  option  were  enabled  but  will  not  be  executed.
                              Otherwise, the leading <b>;</b> will be ignored.

                      If no option name is supplied, then the current option settings are printed.

              <b>-p</b>      Disables processing of the <b>$HOME/.profile</b> file and uses the file <b>/etc/suid_profile</b> instead
                      of the <b>ENV</b> file.  This mode is on whenever the effective UID (GID) is  not  equal  to  the
                      real  UID  (GID).  Turning this off causes the effective UID and GID to be set to the real
                      UID and GID.
              <b>-r</b>      Enables the restricted shell.  This option cannot be unset once set.
              <b>-s</b>      Sort the positional parameters lexicographically.
              <b>-t</b>      (Obsolete).  Exit after reading and executing one command.
              <b>-u</b>      Treat unset parameters as an error when substituting.  <b>$@</b> and <b>$*</b> are exempt.
              <b>-v</b>      Print shell input lines as they are read.
              <b>-x</b>      Print commands and their arguments as they are executed.
              <b>--</b>      Do not change any of the options; useful in setting <b>$1</b> to a value beginning with <b>-</b>.  If no
                      arguments follow this option then the positional parameters are unset.

              As an obsolete feature, if the first <u>arg</u> is <b>-</b> then the <b>-x</b> and <b>-v</b> options are turned  off  and  the
              next  <u>arg</u>  is  treated  as  the  first argument.  Using <b>+</b> rather than <b>-</b> causes these options to be
              turned off.  These options can also be used upon invocation of the  shell.   The  current  set  of
              options  may  be  found  in  <b>$-</b>.   Unless  <b>-A</b> is specified, the remaining arguments are positional
              parameters and are assigned, in order, to <b>$1</b> <b>$2</b> ....  If no arguments are given,  then  the  names
              and values of all variables are printed on the standard output.

       † <b>shift</b> [ <u>n</u> ]
              The positional parameters from <b>$</b><u>n</u><b>+1</b> ...  are renamed <b>$1</b> ... , default <u>n</u> is 1.  The parameter <u>n</u> can
              be any arithmetic expression that evaluates to a non-negative number less than or equal to <b>$#</b>.

       <b>sleep</b> [ <b>-s</b> ] <u>duration</u>
              Suspends  execution  for the number of decimal seconds or fractions of a second given by <u>duration</u>.
              <u>duration</u> can be an integer, floating point value or ISO 8601 duration  specifying  the  length  of
              time  to  sleep.  The option <b>-s</b> causes the sleep builtin to terminate when it receives any signal.
              If <u>duration</u> is not specified in conjunction with <b>-s</b>, <b>sleep</b> will wait for a signal indefinitely.

       <b>source</b> <u>name</u> [ <u>arg</u> ... ]
              Same as <b>.</b>, except it is not treated as a special built-in command.

       <b>stop</b> <u>job</u> ...
              Sends a <b>SIGSTOP</b> signal to one or more processes specified  by  <u>job</u>,  suspending  them  until  they
              receive <b>SIGCONT</b>.  The same as <b>kill</b> <b>-s</b> <b>STOP</b>.

       <b>suspend</b>
              Sends  a  <b>SIGSTOP</b>  signal  to the main shell process, suspending the script or child shell session
              until it receives <b>SIGCONT</b> (for instance, when typing  <b>fg</b>  in  the  parent  shell).  Equivalent  to
              <b>kill</b> <b>-s</b> <b>STOP</b> <b>"$$"</b>, except that it accepts no operands and refuses to suspend a login shell.

       <b>test</b> <u>expression</u>
              The  <b>test</b>  and  <b>[</b>  commands  execute conditional expressions similar to those specified for the <b>[[</b>
              compound command under <u>Conditional</u> <u>Expressions</u> above, but with several important differences.  The
              <b>=</b>,  <b>==</b>  and  <b>!=</b> operators test for string (in)equality without pattern matching; <b>==</b> is nonstandard
              and unportable. The <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and <b>||</b> operators are not available. Instead, the <b>-a</b> and <b>-o</b> binary operators
              can be used, but they are fraught with pitfalls  due  to  grammatical  ambiguities  and  therefore
              deprecated in favor of invoking separate <b>test</b> commands. Most importantly, as <b>test</b> and <b>[</b> are simple
              regular  commands, field splitting and pathname expansion <u>are</u> performed on all their arguments and
              all aspects of regular shell grammar (such as redirection) remain active. This is usually harmful,
              so care must be taken to quote arguments and expansions to avoid this. To avoid the many  pitfalls
              arising  from these issues, the <b>[[</b> compound command should be used instead. The primary purpose of
              the <b>test</b> and <b>[</b> commands is compatibility with other shells that lack <b>[[</b>.

              The <b>test</b>/<b>[</b> command does not parse options except if there are two arguments and the second is  <b>--</b>.
              To  access  the  inline  documentation  with  an  option  such as <b>--man</b>, you need one of the forms
              <b>test</b> <b>--man</b> <b>--</b> or <b>[</b> <b>--man</b> <b>--</b> <b>]</b>.

       <b>times</b>  Displays the accumulated user and system CPU times, one line with the times used by the shell  and
              another  with those used by all of the shell's child processes. No options are supported.  Seconds
              are zero-padded unless the <b>posix</b> shell option is on.

       † <b>trap</b> [ <b>-p</b> ] [ <u>action</u> ] [ <u>sig</u> ] ...
              The <b>-p</b> option causes the trap action associated with each trap as specified by the arguments to be
              printed with appropriate quoting.  Otherwise, <u>action</u> will be processed as if it were  an  argument
              to  <b>eval</b>  when the shell receives signal(s) <u>sig</u>.  Each <u>sig</u> can be given as a number or as the name
              of the signal.  Trap commands are executed in order of signal number.  Any attempt to set  a  trap
              on  a  signal that was ignored on entry to the current shell is ineffective.  If <u>action</u> is omitted
              and the first <u>sig</u> is a number, or if <u>action</u> is <b>-</b>, then the trap(s) for each <u>sig</u> are reset to their
              original values.  If <u>action</u> is the empty string, then this signal is ignored by the shell  and  by
              the commands it invokes.  If <u>sig</u> is <b>ERR</b> then <u>action</u> will be executed whenever a command has a non-
              zero exit status.  If <u>sig</u> is <b>DEBUG</b> then <u>action</u> will be executed before each command.  The variable
              <b>.sh.command</b>  will  contain  the current command line when <u>action</u> is running, in the same format as
              the output generated by the <b>xtrace</b> option (minus the preceding <b>PS4</b> prompt).  If the exit status of
              the trap is <b>2</b> the command will not be executed.  If the exit status of the trap is <b>255</b> and  inside
              a  function  or a dot script, the function or dot script will return.  If <u>sig</u> is <b>0</b> or <b>EXIT</b> and the
              <b>trap</b> statement is executed inside the body of a function defined with the  <b>function</b>  <u>name</u>  syntax,
              then  the command <u>action</u> is executed after the function completes.  If <u>sig</u> is <b>0</b> or <b>EXIT</b> for a <b>trap</b>
              set outside any function then the command <u>action</u> is executed on exit from the shell.   If  <u>sig</u>  is
              <b>KEYBD</b>, then <u>action</u> will be executed whenever a key is read while in <b>emacs</b>, <b>gmacs</b>, or <b>vi</b> mode.  The
              <b>trap</b> command with no arguments prints a list of commands associated with each signal number.

       An  <b>exit</b> or <b>return</b> without an argument in a trap action will preserve the exit status of the command that
       invoked the trap.

       <b>true</b>   Does nothing, and exits 0. Used with <b>while</b> for infinite loops.

              Sets attributes and values for shell variables and functions.   When  invoked  inside  a  function
              defined  with  the  <b>function</b> <u>name</u> syntax, a new instance of the variable <u>vname</u> is created, and the
              variable's value and type are restored  when  the  function  completes.   The  following  list  of
              attributes may be specified:
              <b>-A</b>     Declares  <u>vname</u>  to be an associative array.  Subscripts are strings rather than arithmetic
                     expressions.
              <b>-C</b>     Causes each <u>vname</u> to be a compound variable. If <u>value</u> names  a  compound  variable,  it  is
                     copied into <u>vname</u>.  Otherwise, the empty compound value is assigned to <u>vname</u>.
              <b>-a</b>     Declares  <u>vname</u>  to be an indexed array. This is the default.  Subscripts are numerical and
                     start at 0.  To make it possible to use alphanumeric enumeration constants of a given  type
                     as  subscripts,  an  option  value  of  the  form  <b>[</b><u>type</u><b>]</b>  can  be specified (including the
                     surrounding square brackets), which should be quoted to avoid  pathname  expansion),  where
                     <u>type</u> must be the name of an enumeration type created with the <b>enum</b> command.
              <b>-E</b>     Declares  <u>vname</u>  to  be  a  double  precision  floating point number.  If <u>n</u> is non-zero, it
                     defines the number of significant figures that are used when expanding  <u>vname</u>.   Otherwise,
                     ten significant figures will be used.
              <b>-F</b>     Declares  <u>vname</u>  to  be  a  double  precision  floating point number.  If <u>n</u> is non-zero, it
                     defines the number of places after the decimal point that are used  when  expanding  <u>vname</u>.
                     Otherwise ten places after the decimal point will be used.
              <b>-H</b>     This option provides UNIX to host-name file mapping on non-UNIX machines.
              <b>-L</b>     Left  justify and remove leading blanks from <u>value</u>.  If <u>n</u> is non-zero, it defines the width
                     of the field, otherwise it is determined by the width of the  value  of  first  assignment.
                     When  the  variable  is assigned to, it is filled on the right with blanks or truncated, if
                     necessary, to fit into the field.  The <b>-R</b> option is turned off.
              <b>-M</b>     Use the character mapping <u>mapping</u> defined by <u><a href="../man3/wctrans.3.html">wctrans</a></u>(3).  such as <b>tolower</b> and <b>toupper</b>  when
                     assigning  a  value to each of the specified operands.  When <u>mapping</u> is specified and there
                     are not operands, all variables that use this mapping are written to standard output.  When
                     <u>mapping</u> is omitted and there are no operands, all mapped variables are written to  standard
                     output.
              <b>-R</b>     Right  justify and fill with leading blanks.  If <u>n</u> is non-zero, it defines the width of the
                     field, otherwise it is determined by the width of the value of first assignment.  The field
                     is left filled with blanks or truncated from the end if the variable is reassigned.  The <b>-L</b>
                     option is turned off.
              <b>-S</b>     When used within the <u>assign_list</u> of a type definition, it causes the specified  subvariable
                     to  be  shared  by all instances of the type.  When used inside a function defined with the
                     <b>function</b>  reserved  word,  the  specified  variables  will  have  <u>function</u>  <u>static</u>   scope.
                     Otherwise, the variable is unset prior to processing the assignment list.
              <b>-T</b>     If  followed  by  <u>tname</u>,  it  creates  a  type named by <u>tname</u> using the compound assignment
                     <u>assign_list</u> to <u>tname</u>.  Otherwise, it writes all the type definitions to standard output.
              <b>-X</b>     Declares <u>vname</u> to be a double precision floating point number  and  expands  using  the  <b>%a</b>
                     format  of  ISO-C99.  If <u>n</u> is non-zero, it defines the number of hex digits after the radix
                     point that is used when expanding <u>vname</u>.  The default is 10.
              <b>-Z</b>     Right justify and fill with leading zeros if the first non-blank character is a  digit  and
                     the  <b>-L</b>  option has not been set.  Remove leading zeros if the <b>-L</b> option is also set.  If <u>n</u>
                     is non-zero, it defines the width of the field, otherwise it is determined by the width  of
                     the value of first assignment.
              <b>-f</b>     The  names  refer to function names rather than variable names.  No assignments can be made
                     and the only other valid options are <b>-S</b>, <b>-t</b>, <b>-u</b> and <b>-x</b>.  The -S can be used with discipline
                     functions defined in a type to  indicate  that  the  function  is  static.   For  a  static
                     function,  the  same  method  will  be  used  by all instances of that type no matter which
                     instance references it.  In addition, it can only use value of variables from the  original
                     type definition.  These discipline functions cannot be redefined in any type instance.  The
                     <b>-t</b> option turns on execution tracing for this function.  The <b>-u</b> option causes this function
                     to  be  marked  undefined.   The  <b>FPATH</b>  variable  will  be  searched  to find the function
                     definition when the function is referenced.  If no options other than <b>-f</b> is specified, then
                     the function definition will be displayed on standard output.  If <b>+f</b> is specified,  then  a
                     line  containing  the  function name followed by a shell comment containing the line number
                     and path name of the file where this function was defined, if any, is displayed.  The  exit
                     status  can  be  used  to  determine  whether  the  function  is defined so that <b>typeset</b> <b>-f</b>
                     <b>.sh.math.</b><u>name</u> will return 0 when math function <u>name</u> is defined and non-zero otherwise.
              <b>-b</b>     The variable can hold any number of bytes of data.  The data can be text  or  binary.   The
                     value is represented by the base64 encoding of the data.  If <b>-Z</b> is also specified, the size
                     in  bytes  of the data in the buffer will be determined by the size associated with the <b>-Z</b>.
                     If the base64 string assigned results in more data, it will be  truncated.   Otherwise,  it
                     will  be filled with bytes whose value is zero.  The <b>printf</b> format <b>%B</b> can be used to output
                     the actual data in this buffer instead of the base64 encoding of the data.
              <b>-g</b>     Forces variables to be created or modified at  the  global  scope,  even  when  <b>typeset</b>  is
                     executed  in  a  function defined by the <b>function</b> <u>name</u> syntax (see <u>Functions</u> above) or in a
                     name space (see <u>Name</u> <u>Spaces</u> above).
              <b>-h</b>     Used within type definitions to add  information  when  generating  information  about  the
                     subvariable  on  the man page.  It is ignored when used outside of a type definition.  When
                     used with <b>-f</b> the information is associated with the corresponding discipline function.
              <b>-i</b>     Declares <u>vname</u> to be represented  internally  as  integer.   The  right  hand  side  of  an
                     assignment  is evaluated as an arithmetic expression when assigning to an integer.  If <u>n</u> is
                     non-zero, it defines the output arithmetic base, otherwise the output base will be ten.
              <b>-l</b>     Used with <b>-i</b>, <b>-E</b> or <b>-F</b>, to indicate long integer, or long float.  Otherwise, all  uppercase
                     characters  are  converted  to  lowercase.   The  uppercase  option,  <b>-u</b>,  is  turned  off.
                     Equivalent to <b>-M</b> <b>tolower</b> <b>.</b>
              <b>-m</b>     Moves or renames the variable.  The value is the name of a variable  whose  value  will  be
                     moved  to  <u>vname</u>.   The  original  variable  will  be unset.  Cannot be used with any other
                     options.
              <b>-n</b>     Declares <u>vname</u> to be a reference to the variable whose name is  defined  by  the  value  of
                     variable  <u>vname</u>.  This is usually used to reference a variable inside a function whose name
                     has been passed as an argument.  Cannot be used with other options except <b>-g</b>.
              <b>-p</b>     The name, attributes and values for the given <u>vname</u>s are written on standard  output  in  a
                     form  that  can  be  used  as  shell  input.   If  <b>+p</b> is specified, then the values are not
                     displayed.
              <b>-r</b>     The given <u>vname</u>s are marked read-only and these  names  cannot  be  changed  by  subsequent
                     assignment.
              <b>-s</b>     When given along with <b>-i</b>, restricts integer size to short.
              <b>-t</b>     Tags the variables.  Tags are user definable and have no special meaning to the shell.
              <b>-u</b>     When  given along with <b>-i</b>, specifies unsigned integer.  Otherwise, all lowercase characters
                     are converted to uppercase.  The lowercase option, <b>-l</b>, is turned  off.   Equivalent  to  <b>-M</b>
                     <b>toupper</b> <b>.</b>
              <b>-x</b>     The  given  <u>vname</u>s  are  marked  for  automatic  export to the <u>environment</u> of subsequently-
                     executed commands.  Variables whose names contain a <b>.</b>  cannot be exported.

              The <b>-i</b>, <b>-F</b>, <b>-E</b>, and <b>-X</b> options cannot be specified along with <b>-R</b>, <b>-L</b>, or <b>-Z</b>.  The <b>-b</b> option cannot
              be specified along with <b>-L</b>, <b>-u</b>, or <b>-l</b>.  The <b>-f</b>, <b>-m</b>, <b>-n</b>, and <b>-T</b> options  cannot  be  used  together
              with any other option.

              Using  <b>+</b>  rather than <b>-</b> causes these options to be turned off.  If no <u>vname</u> arguments are given, a
              list of <u>vnames</u> (and optionally the <u>values</u>) of the <u>variables</u> is printed.  (Using <b>+</b>  rather  than  <b>-</b>
              keeps the values from being printed.)  The <b>-p</b> option causes <b>typeset</b> followed by the option letters
              to  be printed before each name rather than the names of the options.  If any option other than <b>-p</b>
              is given, only those variables which have all of the given options are  printed.   Otherwise,  the
              <u>vname</u>s and <u>attributes</u> of all <u>variables</u> that have attributes are printed.

       <b>ulimit</b> [ <b>-HSaMctdfkxlqenVuPpmrRbiswTv</b> ] [ <u>limit</u> ]
              Set or display a resource limit.  The available resource limits are listed below.  Many systems do
              not  support one or more of these limits.  The limit for a specified resource is set when <u>limit</u> is
              specified.  The value of <u>limit</u> can be a number in the unit specified below with each resource,  or
              the  value  <b>unlimited</b>.  The <b>-H</b> and <b>-S</b> options specify whether the hard limit or the soft limit for
              the given resource is set.  A hard limit cannot be increased once it is set.  A soft limit can  be
              increased  up  to  the  value  of the hard limit.  If neither the <b>H</b> nor <b>S</b> option is specified, the
              limit applies to both.  The current resource limit is printed when  <u>limit</u>  is  omitted.   In  this
              case,  the soft limit is printed unless <b>H</b> is specified.  When more than one resource is specified,
              then the limit name and unit is printed before the value.
              <b>-a</b>     Lists all of the current resource limits.
              <b>-b</b>     The socket buffer size in bytes.
              <b>-c</b>     The number of 512-byte blocks on the size of core dumps.
              <b>-d</b>     The number of K-bytes on the size of the data area.
              <b>-e</b>     The scheduling priority.
              <b>-f</b>     The number of 512-byte blocks on files that can be written by the  current  process  or  by
                     child processes (files of any size may be read).
              <b>-i</b>     The signal queue size.
              <b>-k</b>     The max number of kqueues created by the current user.
              <b>-l</b>     The locked address space in K-bytes.
              <b>-M</b>     The address space limit in K-bytes.
              <b>-m</b>     The number of K-bytes on the size of physical memory.
              <b>-n</b>     The number of file descriptors plus 1.
              <b>-P</b>     The max number of pseudo-terminals created by the current user.
              <b>-p</b>     The number of 512-byte blocks for pipe buffering.
              <b>-q</b>     The message queue size in K-bytes.
              <b>-R</b>     The  max  time a real-time process can run before blocking, in microseconds.  If this limit
                     is exceeded the process is sent a <b>SIGXCPU</b> signal.
              <b>-r</b>     The max real-time priority.
              <b>-s</b>     The number of K-bytes on the size of the stack area.
              <b>-T</b>     The number of threads.
              <b>-t</b>     The number of CPU seconds to be used by each process.

              <b>-V</b>     The number of open vnode monitors.
              <b>-v</b>     The number of K-bytes for virtual memory.
              <b>-w</b>     The swap size in K-bytes.
              <b>-x</b>     The number of file locks.

              If no option is given, <b>-f</b> is assumed.

       <b>umask</b> [ <b>-S</b> ] [ <u>mask</u> ]
              The user file-creation mask is set to <u>mask</u> (see <u><a href="../man2/umask.2.html">umask</a></u>(2)).  <u>mask</u> can either be an octal number  or
              a  symbolic  value as described in <u><a href="../man1/chmod.1.html">chmod</a></u>(1).  If a symbolic value is given, the new umask value is
              the complement of the result of applying <u>mask</u> to the complement of the previous umask  value.   If
              <u>mask</u>  is  omitted,  the current value of the mask is printed.  The <b>-S</b> option causes the mode to be
              printed as a symbolic value.  Otherwise, the mask is printed in octal.

       <b>unalias</b> [ <b>-a</b> ] <u>name</u> ...
              The aliases given by the list of <u>name</u>s are removed from the alias list.  The <b>-a</b> option causes  all
              the aliases to be unset.

       † <b>unset</b> [ <b>-fnv</b> ] <u>vname</u> ...
              The  variables  given by the list of <u>vname</u>s are unassigned, i.e., except for subvariables within a
              type, their values and attributes are erased.  For subvariables of a type, the values are reset to
              the default value from the type definition.  Readonly variables cannot be unset.  If the <b>-f</b> option
              is set, then the names refer to <u>function</u> names.  If the <b>-v</b> option is set, then the names refer  to
              <u>variable</u> names.  The <b>-f</b> option overrides <b>-v</b>.  If <b>-n</b> is set and <u>name</u> is a name reference, then <u>name</u>
              will  be  unset  rather  than  the  variable that it references.  The default is equivalent to <b>-v</b>.
              Unsetting <b>LINENO</b>, <b>MAILCHECK</b>, <b>OPTARG</b>, <b>OPTIND</b>, <b>RANDOM</b>, <b>SECONDS</b>, <b>TMOUT</b>, and <b>_</b> removes  their  special
              meaning even if they are subsequently assigned to.

       <b>wait</b> [ <u>job</u> ... ]
              Wait  for  the  specified  <u>job</u>  and  report its termination status.  If <u>job</u> is not given, then all
              currently active child processes are waited for.  The exit status from this command is that of the
              last process waited for if <u>job</u> is specified; otherwise it is zero.  See <u>Jobs</u> for a description  of
              the format of <u>job</u>.

       <b>whence</b> [ <b>-afpPqtv</b> ] <u>name</u> ...
              For each <u>name</u>, indicate how it would be interpreted if used as a command name.
              The  <b>-v</b> option produces a more verbose report.  The <b>-f</b> option skips the search for functions.  The
              <b>-p</b> and <b>-P</b> options do a path search for <u>name</u> even if name is an alias, a function,  or  a  reserved
              word.   Both  of these options turn off the <b>-v</b> option.  The <b>-q</b> option causes <b>whence</b> to enter quiet
              mode.  <b>whence</b> will return zero if all arguments are built-ins, functions, or are programs found on
              the path.  The <b>-t</b> option only outputs the type of the given command.  Like <b>-p</b> and <b>-P</b>, <b>-t</b> will turn
              off the <b>-v</b> option.  The <b>-a</b> option is similar to the <b>-v</b> option but causes  all  interpretations  of
              the given name to be reported.

   <b>Invocation.</b>
       If  the  shell  is  invoked  by <u><a href="../man2/exec.2.html">exec</a></u>(2), initialization depends on argument zero (<b>$0</b>) as follows.  If the
       first character of <b>$0</b> is <b>-</b>, or the <b>-l</b> option is given on the invocation command line, then the  shell  is
       assumed  to  be a <u>login</u> shell.  If the basename of the command path in <b>$0</b> is <b>rsh</b>, <b>rksh</b>, or <b>krsh</b>, then the
       shell becomes restricted.  If the basename is <b>sh</b>  or  <b>rsh</b>,  or  the  <b>-o</b> <b>posix</b>  option  is  given  on  the
       invocation command line, then the shell is initialized in full POSIX compliance mode (see the <b>set</b> builtin
       command  above for more information).  After this, if the shell was assumed to be a <u>login</u> shell, commands
       are read from <b><a href="file:/etc/profile">/etc/profile</a></b> and then from <b>$HOME/.profile</b> if  it  exists.   Alternatively,  the  option  <b>-l</b>
       causes  the  shell  to be treated as a <u>login</u> shell.  Next, for interactive shells, commands are read from
       the file named by <b>ENV</b> if the file exists, its name being determined by  performing  parameter  expansion,
       command  substitution,  and  arithmetic  expansion  on the value of that environment variable.  If the <b>-s</b>
       option is not present and <u>arg</u> and a file by the name of <u>arg</u> exists,  then  it  reads  and  executes  this
       script.  Otherwise, if the first <u>arg</u> does not contain a <b>/</b>, a path search is performed on the first <u>arg</u> to
       determine  the name of the script to execute.  The script <u>arg</u> must have execute permission and any <u>setuid</u>
       and <u>setgid</u> settings will be ignored.  If the script is not found on the path, <u>arg</u> is processed as  if  it
       named  a  built-in command or function.  Commands are then read as described below; the following options
       are interpreted by the shell when it is invoked:

       <b>-D</b>      A list of all double quoted strings that are preceded by a <b>$</b> will be printed on  standard  output
               and  the  shell  will exit.  This set of strings will be subject to language translation when the
               locale is not C or POSIX.  No commands will be executed.

       <b>-E</b> or <b>-o</b> <b>rc</b> or <b>--rc</b>
               Read the file named by the <b>ENV</b> variable or by <b>$HOME/.kshrc</b> if not defined after the profiles.  On
               by default for interactive shells. Use <b>+E</b>, <b>+o</b> <b>rc</b> or <b>--norc</b> to turn off.

       <b>-c</b>      Read and execute a script from the first <u>arg</u> instead of a file.   The  second  <u>arg</u>,  if  present,
               becomes that script's command name (<b>$0</b>).  Any third and further <u>arg</u>s become positional parameters
               starting at <b>$1</b>.

       <b>-s</b>      Read and execute a script from standard input instead of a file.  The command name (<b>$0</b>) cannot be
               set.   Any  <u>arg</u>s become the positional parameters starting at <b>$1</b>.  This option is forced on if no
               <u>arg</u> is given and is ignored if <b>-c</b> is also specified.

       <b>-i</b> or <b>-o</b> <b>interactive</b> or <b>--interactive</b>
               If the <b>-i</b> option is present or if the shell's standard input and standard error are attached to a
               terminal (as told by <u><a href="../man3/tcgetattr.3.html">tcgetattr</a></u>(3)), then this shell is <u>interactive</u>.  In this case TERM is ignored
               (so that <b>kill</b> <b>0</b> does not kill an interactive shell) and INTR is caught and ignored (so that  <b>wait</b>
               is interruptible).  In all cases, QUIT is ignored by the shell.

       <b>-r</b> or <b>-o</b> <b>restricted</b> or <b>--restricted</b>
               If the <b>-r</b> option is present, the shell is a restricted shell.

       The  remaining  options  and  arguments  are described under the <b>set</b> command above.  An optional <b>-</b> as the
       first argument is ignored.

   <b>Rksh</b> <b>Only.</b>
       <u>Rksh</u> is used to set up login names and execution environments whose capabilities are more controlled than
       those of the standard shell.  The actions of <b>rksh</b>  are  identical  to  those  of  <b>ksh</b>,  except  that  the
       following are disallowed:

              •      unsetting the restricted option

              •      changing directory (see <u><a href="../man1/cd.1.html">cd</a></u>(1))

              •      setting or unsetting the value or attributes of <b>SHELL</b>, <b>ENV</b>, <b>FPATH</b>, or <b>PATH</b>

              •      specifying path or command names containing <b>/</b>

              •      redirecting output (<b>&gt;</b>, <b>&gt;|</b>, <b>&lt;&gt;</b>, and <b>&gt;&gt;</b>)

              •      adding or deleting built-in commands

              •      using <b>command</b> <b>-p</b> to invoke a command

       The restrictions above are enforced after <b>.profile</b> and the <b>ENV</b> files are interpreted.

       When a command to be executed is found to be a shell procedure, <b>rksh</b> invokes <u>ksh</u> to execute it.  Thus, it
       is  possible  to  provide  to  the  end-user  shell  procedures that have access to the full power of the
       standard shell, while imposing a limited menu of commands; this scheme assumes that the end-user does not
       have write and execute permissions in the same directory.

       The net effect of these rules is that the writer of the <b>.profile</b> has complete control over user  actions,
       by performing guaranteed setup actions and leaving the user in an appropriate directory (probably <u>not</u> the
       login directory).

       The  system  administrator  often  sets  up  a directory of commands (e.g., <b>/usr/rbin</b>) that can be safely
       invoked by <b>rksh</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       Errors detected by the shell, such as syntax errors, cause the shell to return a  non-zero  exit  status.
       If  the  shell  is being used non-interactively, then execution of the shell file is abandoned unless the
       error occurs inside a subshell in which case the subshell is abandoned.  Otherwise, the shell returns the
       exit status of the last command executed (see also the <b>exit</b> command above).  Run time errors detected  by
       the  shell  are  reported  by printing the command or function name and the error condition.  If the line
       number that the error occurred on is greater than one, then the line number is  also  printed  in  square
       brackets (<b>[]</b>) after the command or function name.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="file:/etc/profile">/etc/profile</a></b>
              The system wide initialization file, executed for login shells.

       <b>$HOME/.profile</b>
              The personal initialization file, executed for login shells after /etc/profile.

       <b>$HOME/.kshrc</b>
              Default personal initialization file, executed for interactive shells when <b>ENV</b> is not set.

       <b>/etc/suid_profile</b>
              Alternative  initialization  file,  executed  instead of the personal initialization file when the
              real and effective user or group ID do not match.

       <b>/dev/null</b>
              The null device.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       If a command is executed, and then a command with the same name is installed in a directory in the search
       path  before  the  directory  where  the  original command was found, the shell will continue to <u>exec</u> the
       original command.  Use the <b>hash</b> command or the <b>-t</b> option of the <b>alias</b> command to correct this situation.

       Using the <b>hist</b> built-in command within a compound command will cause the whole command to disappear  from
       the history file.

       The  built-in command <b>.</b> <u>file</u> reads the whole file before any commands are executed.  Therefore, <b>alias</b> and
       <b>unalias</b> commands in the file will not apply to any commands defined in the file.

       Traps are not processed while a job is waiting for a foreground process.  Thus, a trap on <b>CHLD</b>  won't  be
       executed until the foreground job terminates.

       In  locales  that use a multibyte character set such as UTF-8, the <b>KEYBD</b> trap is only triggered for ASCII
       characters (1-127).

       It is a good idea to leave a space after the comma operator in  arithmetic  expressions  to  prevent  the
       comma from being interpreted as the decimal point character in certain locales.

                                                                                                          <u><a href="../man1/KSH.1.html">KSH</a></u>(1)
