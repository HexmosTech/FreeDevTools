       etherpuppet — create a virtual interface from a remote Ethernet interface

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>etherpuppet</b> [<b>-s</b> <u>port</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>target:port</u>] [<b>-B</b>] [<b>-S</b>] [<b>-M</b> <u>filter</u>] [<b>-C</b>] [<b>-i</b> <u>iface</u>]
       <b>etherpuppet</b> [<b>-m</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>port</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>target:port</u>] [<b>-I</b> <u>iface</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>etherpuppet</b>  is  a  small  program that will create a virtual interface <u>(TUN/TAP)</u> on one machine from the
       ethernet interface of another machine through a TCP connection. Everything seen  by  the  real  interface
       will  be  seen  by  the virtual one. Everything sent to the virtual interface will be emitted by the real
       one.

       It has been designed because one often has a small machine as his Internet gateway, and sometimes want to
       run some big applications that need raw access to this interface, for sniffing (Ethereal, etc.)   or  for
       crafting packets that do not survive being reassembled, NATed, etc.

       When  launched with the first syntax, <b>etherpuppet</b> is a slave that will send to its master everything that
       passes on the given interface. With the second syntax, <b>etherpuppet</b> is the  master  and  will  create  the
       special  <u>TAP</u> device (whose default name starts with <u>puppet</u>.  In both modes, <b>etherpuppet</b> is able to either
       connect or listen to its slave/master.

       Traffic seen by the real interface is sent through the TCP connection to the doll interface. Thus, it  is
       important  that  this  connection  is not seen by the real interface (or else, we'll have a cute infinite
       traffic loop).

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-s</b> <u>port</u>
               Listen on the given TCP port.

       <b>-c</b> <u>ip:port</u>
               Connect to the slave/master on the given IP/port.

       <b>-i</b> <u>iface</u>
               Vampirize the given interface name.

       <b>-I</b> <u>ifname</u>
               Choose the name of the virtual interface.

       <b>-m</b>      Master mode.

       <b>-B</b>      Do not use <u>BPF</u>.  With this option, <b>etherpuppet</b> may see its own traffic.

       <b>-S</b>      Build <u>BPF</u> with the content of <u>SSH_CONNECTION</u> environment variable.

       <b>-M</b> <u>src:sp,dst:dp</u>
               Build manually a <u>BPF</u> filter that will exclude matching traffic in both directions.

       <b>-C</b>      Do not copy real interface parameters to virtual interface.

       The source and destination are by default the TCP connection end points. If you go through SSH tunneling,
       you can use the <b>-S</b> option to use <u>SSH_CONNECTION</u> environment variable content instead, so  that  you  will
       filter  out the SSH connection of your current session and not the connection to the local SSH tunnel end
       point (which is pointless). If this still not fit your needs, you can manually specify the connection end
       points with <b>-M</b>.

       If you connect two Etherpuppet instances in  master  mode,  you'll  get  a  TCP  tunnel  through  virtual
       interfaces.

       If  you connect two Etherpuppet instances in slave mode, you may get some kind of inefficient distributed
       bridge, but more probably, you'll get a big mess.
