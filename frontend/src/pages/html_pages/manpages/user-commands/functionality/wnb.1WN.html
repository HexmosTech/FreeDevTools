</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wnb - WordNet window-based browser interface

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wnb</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wnb()</b> provides a window-based interface for browsing the WordNet database, allowing synsets and relations
       to  be  displayed  as  formatted  text.   For each search word, different searches are available based on
       syntactic category and information available in the database.

       <b>wnb</b> is written in Tcl/Tk, which is available for Unix and Windows platforms.  This allows the  same  code
       to work on all supported WordNet platforms without modification.

</pre><h4><b>WNB</b> <b>WINDOWS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wnb()</b>  was  developed with the philosophy that only those searches and buttons that are applicable at the
       current time are displayed.  As a result, the appearance of the interface changes as it is used.  Use the
       standard windowing system mouse functions to open and close the WordNet Browser Window, move the  window,
       and change its size.

       The WordNet Browser Window contains the following areas, from top to bottom:

       Menubar             A  menubar  runs  along  the top of the browser window with pulldown menus and button
                           entitled <b>File</b>, <b>History</b>, <b>Options</b>, and <b>Help</b>.

       Search Word Entry   Below the Menubar is a line for entering the search word.  A search  word  can  be  a
                           single  word,  hyphenated  string, or a collocation.  Case is ignored.  Although only
                           uninflected forms of words are usually  stored  in  WordNet,  users  may  search  for
                           inflected   forms.    WordNet's   morphological   processor   finds   the  base  form
                           automatically.

       Search Selection    Below the Search Word Entry line is an area for selecting the search type and  senses
                           to  search.   Until a search word is entered this area is blank.  After a search word
                           is entered, buttons appear corresponding to  each  syntactic  category  (<b>Noun</b>,  <b>Verb</b>,
                           <b>Adjective</b>, <b>Adverb</b>) in which the search string is defined in WordNet.

                           At  the  right edge of the Search Selection line is a box for entering sense numbers.
                           When this box is empty, search results for all senses of the search word  that  match
                           the  search type are displayed.  The search may be restricted to one or more specific
                           senses by entering a comma or space separated list of sense  numbers  in  the  <b>Senses</b>
                           box.   These  sense numbers remain in effect until either the user changes or deletes
                           them, or a new search word is entered.

       Results Window      Most of the browser window consists of a large text buffer for displaying the results
                           of WordNet searches.  Horizontal and vertical scroll bars are present  for  scrolling
                           through the output.

       Status Line         A  status  line  is  at  the  bottom  of the browser window.  When search results are
                           displayed in the Results Window,  this  status  line  reflects  the  type  of  search
                           selected.   When  there is no search word entered, your are prompted to <b>"Enter</b> <b>search</b>
                           <b>word</b> <b>and</b> <b>press</b> <b>return."</b>  If the search word entered is not in  WordNet,  the  message
                           <b>"Sorry,</b> <b>no</b> <b>matches</b> <b>found."</b> is displayed.

</pre><h4><b>SEARCHING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>DATABASE</b></h4><pre>
       The  WordNet  browser  navigates  through  WordNet  in  two steps.  First a search word is entered and an
       overview of all the senses of the word in all syntactic categories is displayed in  the  Results  Window.
       The  senses  are  grouped  by  syntactic  category,  and each synset is annotated as described above with
       <u>synset_offset</u>, <u>lex_filename</u>, and <u>sense_number</u> as dictated  by  the  advanced  search  options  set.   The
       overview  search  also indicates how many of the senses in each syntactic category are represented in the
       tagged texts.  This is a way for the user to determine  whether  a  sense's  sense  number  is  based  on
       semantic  tagging data, or was arbitrarily assigned.  For each sense that has appeared in such texts, the
       number of semantic tags to that sense are indicated in parentheses after the sense number.

       Then, within a syntactic category, a specific search is selected.  The desired search  is  performed  and
       the  search  results  are  displayed  in the Results Window.  Additional searches on the same word can be
       performed, or a new search word can be entered.

       To enter a search word, click the mouse in the horizontal box labeled <b>Search</b> <b>Word</b>, type  a  single  word,
       hyphenated string, or collocation and press <b>RETURN.</b>

       <b>wnb()</b>  responds  by  making  a  set  of Part of Speech buttons appear in the Search Selection line.  Each
       button corresponds to a syntactic category in which the search string is defined in WordNet.  At the same
       time, an Overview of the synsets for all senses of the search word is displayed in  the  Results  Window.
       The  Overview  includes the gloss for each synset and also indicates which of the senses have appeared in
       the semantically tagged texts.  For each sense that has appeared in such texts, the  number  of  semantic
       tags to that sense are indicated in parentheses after the sense number.

       The  pulldown  menus  in the Search Selection line list all of the WordNet searches that can be performed
       for the search word in that part of speech.  To select a search, highlight it by dragging  the  mouse  to
       it,  and  release  the  mouse  while  it is highlighted.  Drag the mouse outside of the pulldown list and
       release to hide the menu without making a selection.  Dragging  the  mouse  across  the  Part  of  Speech
       buttons displays the available searches for each syntactic category.

       To  restrict a search to one or more senses within a syntactic category, enter a comma or space separated
       list of sense numbers in the <b>Senses</b> box before selecting a search.

       After a search is selected, <b>wnb()</b> performs the search on the WordNet database and displays the  formatted
       results  in  the  Results  Window.   Whenever  search  results are displayed, a button entitled <b>Redisplay</b>
       <b>Overview</b> is present at the right edge of the Search Word Entry line.  Clicking on this button  redisplays
       the Overview of all synsets for the search word in the Results Window.

   <b>Changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Search</b> <b>Word</b>
       A  new  search  word  can  be  entered  at  any time by moving to the Search Word Entry box, if necessary
       highlighting it by clicking, erasing the old string, typing a new one and pressing  <b>RETURN.</b>   The  <b>Senses</b>
       box is cleared if necessary, the Part of Speech buttons applicable to the new search word appear, and the
       Overview for the new search word is displayed.

       The  middle  mouse button can also be used to select a new search word by placing the mouse over any word
       in the Results Window and clicking.  The selected word will replace the text in  the  Search  Word  Entry
       box, and the overview for that word will automatically be displayed.

       To  select  a  new search string collocation from text in the Results Window, highlight the text with the
       mouse and press <b>CONTROL-S.</b>

   <b>Interrupting</b> <b>a</b> <b>Search</b>
       When a search is in progress the message <b>"Searching...(press</b> <b>escape</b> <b>to</b> <b>abort)"</b> is displayed in the Status
       Line.  Note that most searches return very quickly, so this  message  isn't  noticeable.   As  indicated,
       pressing  the  <b>ESCAPE</b>  key will interrupt the search.  The results of the search obtained before the time
       the search was interrupted are displayed in the Results Window.

</pre><h4><b>MENUS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>File</b> <b>Menu</b>
              Find keywords by substring
                     Display a popup window for specifying a search of WordNet for words  or  collocations  that
                     contain  a  specific  substring.   If a search word is currently entered in the <b>Search</b> <b>Word</b>
                     box, it is used as the substring to search for by default.   The  Substring  Search  Window
                     contains  a  box  for entering a substring, a pulldown menu to its right for specifying the
                     part of speech to search, a large area  for  displaying  the  search  results,  and  action
                     buttons at the bottom entitled <b>Search</b>, <b>Save</b>, <b>Print</b> <b>Dismiss</b>.

                     Once  a  substring  is entered and a part of speech selected, clicking on the <b>Search</b> button
                     causes a search to be done for all words and collocations in  WordNet,  in  that  syntactic
                     category, that contain the substring according to the following criteria:

                     1.  The  substring  can  appear  at  the  beginning  or  end of a word, hyphenated string o
                     collocation.

                     2. The substring can appear in the middle of a hyphenated string or collocation,  but  only
                     delimited on both sides by spaces or hyphens.

                     The  search results are displayed in the large buffer.  Clicking on an item from the search
                     results list causes <b>wnb()</b> to automatically enter that word in the <b>Search</b> <b>Word</b>  box  of  the
                     WordNet Browser Window and perform the Overview search.

                     Clicking  the  <b>Save</b>  button  generates a popup dialog for specifying a filename to save the
                     substring search results to.  Clicking the <b>Print</b> button generates a popup dialog in which a
                     print command can be specified.

                     Selecting <b>Dismiss</b> closes the Substring Search Window.

              Save current display
                     Display a popup dialog for specifying  a  filename  to  save  the  current  Results  Window
                     contents to.

              Print current display
                     Display  a  popup  dialog  in which to specify a print command to which the current Results
                     Window contents can be piped. Note - this option does not exist in the Windows version.

              Clear current display
                     Clear the <b>Search</b> <b>Word</b> and <b>Senses</b> boxes, and Results Window.

              Exit   Does what you would expect.

   <b>History</b>
       This pulldown menu contains a list of the last searches performed.  Selecting  an  item  from  this  list
       performs  that  search again.  The maximum number of searches stored in the list can be adjusted from the
       <b>Options</b> menu.  The default is 10.

   <b>Options</b>
              Show help with each search
                     When this checkbox is selected search results are preceded by some explanatory  text  about
                     the type of search selected. This is off by default.

              Show descriptive gloss
                     When  this  checkbox is selected, synset glosses are displayed in all search results.  This
                     is set by default.  Note that glosses are always displayed in the Overview.

              Wrap Lines
                     When this checkbox is selected, lines in the Results Window that are wider than the  window
                     are  automatically  wrapped.  This is set by default.  If not selected, a horizontal scroll
                     bar is present if any lines are longer than the width of the window.

              Set advanced search options...
                     Selecting this item displays a popup window  for  setting  the  following  search  options:
                     <b>Lexical</b> <b>file</b> <b>information;</b> <b>Synset</b> <b>location</b> <b>in</b> <b>database</b> <b>file;</b> <b>Sense</b> <b>number</b>.  Choices for each
                     are:

                          <b>Don't</b> <b>show</b> (default)
                          <b>Show</b> <b>with</b> <b>searches</b>
                          <b>Show</b> <b>with</b> <b>searches</b> <b>and</b> <b>overview</b>

                     When  lexical  file  information  is  shown,  the name of the lexicographer file is printed
                     before each synset, enclosed  in  angle  brackets  (<b>&lt;</b>  <u>...</u>  <b>&gt;</b>).   When  both  lexical  file
                     information  and synset location information are displayed, the synset location information
                     appears first.  If within one lexicographer file more than one sense of a word is  entered,
                     an integer <u>lex_id</u> is appended onto all but one of the word's instances to uniquely identify
                     it.   In  each  synset, each word having a non-zero <u>lex_id</u> is printed with the <u>lex_id</u> value
                     printed immediately following the  word.   If  both  lexicographer  information  and  sense
                     numbers are displayed, <u>lex_id</u>s, if present, precede sense numbers.

                     When  synset  location  is shown, the byte offset of the synset in the database "data" file
                     corresponding to the syntactic category of  the  synset  is  printed  before  each  synset,
                     enclosed  in  curly  braces  (<b>{</b>  <u>...</u>  <b>}</b>).   When  both  lexical file information and synset
                     location information are displayed, the synset location information appears first.

                     When sense numbers are shown, the sense number of each  word  in  each  synset  is  printed
                     immediately after the word, and is preceded by a number sign (<b>#</b>).

              Set maximum history length...
                     Display  a  popup dialog in which the maximum number of previous searches to be kept on the
                     History list can be set.

              Set font...
                     Display a popup window for setting the font (typeface) and font size to use for the Results
                     Window.  Choices for typeface are: <b>Courier</b>, <b>Helvetica</b>, and <b>Times</b> (default).  Font size  can
                     be <b>small</b>, <b>medium</b> (default), or <b>large</b>.

              Save current options as default
                     Save  the  currently  set options.  Next time the browser is started, these options will be
                     used as the user defaults.

</pre><h4><b>SHORCUTS</b></h4><pre>
       Clicking on any word in the Results Window while holding down the <b>SHIFT</b> key on the  keyboard  causes  the
       browser  to  replace <b>Search</b> <b>Word</b> with the word and display its Overview and available searches.  Clicking
       on any word in the Results Window with the middle mouse button does the same thing.

       Pressing the <b>CONTROL-S</b> keys causes the browser to do as above on the text that is currently  highlighted.
       Under  Unix,  this will work even if the highlighted text is in another window.  This works on hyphenated
       strings and collocations, as well as individual words.

       Pressing the <b>CONTROL-G</b> keys displays the Substring Search Window.

</pre><h4><b>SEARCH</b> <b>RESULTS</b></h4><pre>
       The results of a search of the WordNet database are displayed in  the  Results  Window.   Horizontal  and
       vertical scroll bars are present for scrolling through the search results.

       All searches other than the Overview list all senses matching the search results in the following general
       format.  Items enclosed in italicized square brackets (<u>[</u> <u>...</u> <u>]</u>) may not be present.

       If a search cannot be performed on some senses of <u>searchstr</u>, the search results are headed by a string of
       the form:
            X of Y senses of <u>searchstr</u>

              One line listing the number of senses matching the search selected.

              Each sense matching the search selected displayed as follows:

                   <b>Sense</b> <u>n</u>
                   <u>[</u><b>{</b><u>synset_offset</u><b>}</b><u>]</u> <u>[</u><b>&lt;</b><u>lex_filename</u><b>&gt;</b><u>]</u>  <u>word1[</u><b>#</b><u>sense_number][,</u>  <u>word2...]</u>

              Where  <u>n</u> is the sense number of the search word, <u>synset_offset</u> is the byte offset of the synset in
              the <b>data.</b><u>pos</u> file corresponding to the  syntactic  category,  <u>lex_filename</u>  is  the  name  of  the
              lexicographer  file  that  the synset comes from, <u>word1</u> is the first word in the synset (note that
              this is not necessarily the search word) and <u>sense_number</u> is the WordNet sense number assigned  to
              the   preceding  word.   <u>synset_offset</u>,  <u>lex_filename</u>,  and  <u>sense_number</u>  are  generated  if  the
              appropriate Options are specified.

              The synsets matching the search selected are printed below each sense's  synset  output  described
              above.   Each  line  of  output  is preceded by a marker (usually <b>=&gt;</b>), then a synset, formatted as
              described above.  If a search traverses more one level of the  tree,  then  successive  lines  are
              indented  by  spaces  corresponding  to  its  level  in  the  hierarchy.  Glosses are displayed in
              parentheses at the end of each synset if the appropriate Option is set.  Each synset is printed on
              one line.

              Senses are ordered from most to least frequently used, with the  most  common  sense  numbered  <b>1</b>.
              Frequency  of  use  is determined by the number of times a sense is tagged in the various semantic
              concordance texts.  Senses that are not semantically tagged follow the ordered senses.  Note  that
              this ordering is only an estimate based on usage in a small corpus.

              Verb  senses  can  be  grouped  by similarity of meaning, rather than ordered by frequency of use.
              When the <b>"Synonyms,</b> <b>grouped</b> <b>by</b> <b>similarity"</b> search is selected, senses that are  close  in  meaning
              are  printed together, with a line of dashes indicating the end of a group.  See <b><a href="../man7WN/wngroups.7WN.html">wngroups</a></b>(7WN) for
              a discussion how senses are grouped.

              The output of the <b>"Derivationally</b> <b>Related</b> <b>Forms"</b> search shows word forms that are  morphologically
              related  to  <b>searchstr</b>. Each word form pointed to from <u>searchstr</u> is displayed, preceded by <b>RELATED</b>
              <b>TO-&gt;</b> and the syntactic category of the link, followed, on the next line, by its  synset.   Printed
              after the word form is <b>#</b><u>n</u> where <u>n</u> indicates the WordNet sense number of the term pointed to.

              The <b>"Domain"</b> and <b>"Domain</b> <b>Terms"</b> searches show the domain that a synset has been classified in and,
              conversely,  all  of the terms that have been assigned to a specific domain.  A domain is either a
              <b>TOPIC,</b> <b>REGION</b> or <b>USAGE,</b> as reflected in the specific pointer character stored in the database, and
              displayed in the output.  A <b>Domain</b> search on a term shows the domain, if  any,  that  each  synset
              containing  <u>searchstr</u>  has  been  classified in.  The output display shows the domain type (<b>TOPIC,</b>
              <b>REGION</b> or <b>USAGE</b>), followed by the syntactic category of the domain synset and  the  terms  in  the
              synset.   Each term is followed by <b>#</b><u>n</u> where <u>n</u> indicates the WordNet sense number of the term.  The
              converse search, <b>Domain</b> <b>Terms</b>, shows all of the synsets that have  been  placed  into  the  domain
              <u>searchstr</u>, with analogous markers.

              When the <b>"Sentence</b> <b>Frames"</b> search is specified, sample illustrative sentences and generic sentence
              frames  are  displayed.   If  a  sample  sentence  is  found,  the base form of the search word is
              substituted into the sentence, and it is printed below the synset, preceded with the  <b>EX:</b>  marker.
              When  no  sample  sentences are found, the generic sentence frames are displayed.  Sentence frames
              that are acceptable for all words in a synset are preceded by  the  marker  <b>*&gt;</b>.   If  a  frame  is
              acceptable for the search word only, it is preceded by the marker <b>=&gt;</b>.

              Search  results  for adjectives are slightly different from those for other parts of speech.  When
              an adjective is printed, its direct antonym, if it has one, is also printed in parentheses.   When
              the  search word is in a head synset, all of the head synset's satellites are also displayed.  The
              position of an adjective in relation to the noun may be restricted to the <u>prenominal</u>,  <u>postnominal</u>
              or <u>predicative</u> position.  Where present, these restrictions are noted in parentheses.

              When  an  adjective  is  a  participle  of  a verb, the output indicates the verb and displays its
              synset.

              When an adverb is derived from an adjective, the specific adjectival sense on which it is based is
              indicated.

              The morphological transformations performed by the search code may result in more than one word to
              search for.  <b>wnb()</b> automatically performs the requested search on all of the strings  and  returns
              the  results  grouped by word.  For example, the verb <b>saw</b> is both the present tense of <b>saw</b> and the
              past tense of <b>see</b>.  When there is more than one word to search for, search results are grouped  by
              word.
