       fs_getclientaddrs - Displays the client interfaces to register

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fs</b> <b>getclientaddrs</b> [<b>-help</b>]

       <b>fs</b> <b>gc</b> [<b>-h</b>]

       <b>fs</b> <b>getcl</b> [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>fs</b> <b>getclientaddrs</b> command displays the IP addresses of the interfaces that the local Cache Manager
       registers with a File Server when first establishing a connection to it.

       The File Server uses the addresses when it initiates a remote procedure call (RPC) to the Cache Manager
       (as opposed to responding to an RPC sent by the Cache Manager). There are two common circumstances in
       which the File Server initiates RPCs: when it breaks callbacks and when it pings the client machine to
       verify that the Cache Manager is still accessible.

       If an RPC to that interface fails, the File Server simultaneously sends RPCs to all of the other
       interfaces in the list, to learn which of them are still available. Whichever interface replies first is
       the one to which the File Server then sends pings and RPCs to break callbacks.

       <b><a href="../man1/fs_setclientaddrs.1.html">fs_setclientaddrs</a></b>(1) explains how the Cache Manager constructs the list automatically in kernel memory as
       it initializes, and how to use that command to alter the kernel list after initialization.

</pre><h4><b>CAUTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The File Server uses the list of interfaces displayed by this command only when selecting an alternative
       interface after a failed attempt to break a callback or ping the Cache Manager. When responding to the
       Cache Manager's request for file system data, the File Server replies to the interface which the Cache
       Manager used when sending the request. If the File Server's reply to a data request fails, the file
       server machine's network routing configuration determines which alternate network routes to the client
       machine are available for resending the reply.

       The displayed list applies to all File Servers to which the Cache Manager connects in the future. It is
       not practical to register different sets of addresses with different File Servers, because it requires
       using the <b>fs</b> <b>setclientaddrs</b> command to change the list and then rebooting each relevant File Server
       immediately.

       The displayed list is not necessarily governing the behavior of a given File Server, if an administrator
       has issued the <b>fs</b> <b>setclientaddrs</b> command since the Cache Manager first contacted that File Server. It
       determines only which addresses the Cache Manager registers when connecting to File Servers in the
       future.

       The list of interfaces does not influence the Cache Manager's choice of interface when establishing a
       connection to a File Server.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The output displays the IP address of each interface that the Cache Manager is currently registering with
       File  Server  processes  that  it contacts, with one address per line. The File Server initially uses the
       first address for breaking callbacks and pinging the  Cache  Manager,  but  the  ordering  of  the  other
       interfaces is not meaningful.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  example  displays  the  two  interfaces  that  the Cache Manager is registering with File
       Servers.

          % fs getclientaddrs
          192.12.105.68
          192.12.108.84
