       teem  -  simple command-line tools which provide fast and easy access to the functionality in the various
       libraries

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>teem-affine</b>: This uses air's  AIR_AFFINE  macro  to  print  out  the  value  which  stands  in  the  same
       relationship with the interval [&lt;minOut&gt;, &lt;maxOut&gt;] as &lt;value&gt; has with the interval [minIn, maxOut].

       <b>teem-deconv</b>: Does deconvolution.

       <b>teem-airSanity</b>:

       <b>teem-cubic</b>:

       <b>teem-emap</b>: Creates environment maps based on limn's "checker" normal quantization methods. By taking into
       account  camera  parameters,  this  allows  for  both  lights in both world and view space. Solely out of
       laziness, the nrrd format is used for specifying the lights, but not to  worry:  you  can  use  a  simple
       un-adorned text file, defining one light per line, with 7 values per light: 0/1 (world/view space), R G B
       color, and X Y Z position.

       <b>teem-gkms</b>: Semi-Automatic Generation of Transfer Functions

       <b>teem-idx2pos</b>:  Converts  from floating-point "index" to floating-point "position", given the centering of
       the data (cell vs. node), the range of positions, and the number of intervals  into  which  position  has
       been quantized.

       <b>teem-ilk</b>:  (I)mage  (L)inear  Trans(X--&gt;K)forms.  Applies  linear (homogenous coordinate) transforms to a
       given image, using the given kernel for resampling.

       <b>teem-miter</b>: A simple but effective little volume renderer.

       <b>teem-mrender</b>: A demonstration of hoover, gage, and nrrd measures. Uses hoover  to  cast  rays  through  a
       volume  (scalar,  vector,  or  tensor),  gage  to measure one of various quantities along the rays, and a
       specified nrrd measure to reduce all the values along a ray down to one scalar, which  is  saved  in  the
       output (double) image.

       <b>teem-ninspect</b>:  Quick  way  of  seeing  what's  inside  a  3D volume. A color image of three axis-aligned
       projections is composed of histogram-equalized and quantized images  of  the  summation  (red),  variance
       (green), and maximum (blue) intensity projections. If volume is orientation in RAS space, then a standard
       orientation  is  used  for  projections and projections are upsampled (with box kernel) to have isotropic
       pixels.

       <b>teem-ninspect</b>: Quick way of seeing what's inside a  3D  volume.  A  color  image  of  three  axis-aligned
       projections  is  composed  of  histogram-equalized  and quantized images of the summation (red), variance
       (green), and maximum (blue) intensity projections. If volume is orientation in RAS space, then a standard
       orientation is used for projections and projections are upsampled (with box  kernel)  to  have  isotropic
       pixels.

       <b>teem-nrrdSanity</b>:

       <b>teem-overrgb</b>:  Composites  an RGBA nrrd over a background color (or image), after doing gamma correction,
       then quantizes to an 8-bit image. Actually, the input nrrd can have more than 4  values  per  pixel,  but
       only the first four are used.  If the RGBA nrrd is floating point, the values are taken at face value; if
       it is fixed point, the values interpreted as having been quantized (so that 8-bit RGBA images will act as
       you expect). When compositing with a background image, the given background image does not have to be the
       same size as the input image; it will be resampled (with linear interpolation) to fit.

       <b>teem-pos2idx</b>:  Converts  from floating-point "position" to floating-point "index", given the centering of
       the data (cell vs. node), the range of positions, and the number of intervals  into  which  position  has
       been quantized.

       <b>teem-pprobe</b>: Uses gageProbe() to query scalar or vector volumes at a single probe location.

       <b>teem-qbert</b>:  Generates  volume  datasets  friendly to hardware-based volume renderers.  The main value of
       this is a means of combining the functions of resampling a dataset to a particular size, measuring  first
       (and  optionally  second)  derivatives,  and  doing  some semi-intelligent quantization of the derivative
       values down to 8-bits (if quantization is desired). The various up and down sampling, as well as the  the
       VGH measurements, can be done with various nrrd kernels. Also, histogram-equalized VG and VH scatterplots
       can be generated at a specified resolution.

       <b>teem-talkweb</b>:  Generates  HTML  pages  from  slide images and text. This program takes multiple inputs: a
       template for the table of contents that will  become  "index.html"  ("-i"),  a  template  for  the  pages
       generated  for  each  slide  e.g.   "slide000.html"  ("-t"), and a script text file that contains all the
       information that will go into the slide pages. The format of this file is:
         - Separator line indicating slide transitions, e.g. "-------------"
         - Title of first slide (one line)
         - Filename for image to put on first slide (one line)
         - Body of HTML text to put with the slide image (multiple lines)
         - Separator followed by information for the second  slide,  and  so  forth.  Textual  subtitutions  are
       performed  in  the  template files, according to the replacement tags ("-r", see below). Within the slide
       pages, navigation arrows are based on remaining command-line options.

       <b>teem-tend</b>: Diffusion Tensor Processing and Analysis

       <b>teem-undos</b> undos: Converts from DOS text files to normal (converting LF-CR pairs to just  CR),  or,  with
       the  "-r"  option,  convert  back to DOS, for whatever sick and twisted reason you'd have to do that. Can
       also handle legacy MAC text files (only LF). Unlike the simple sed or perl scripts for this purpose, this
       program is careful to be idempotent. Also, this makes an effort to not meddle with binary files (on which
       this may be mistakenly invoked). A message is printed to stderr for all the files actually modified.

       <b>teem-ungantry</b>: Gantry tilt be gone! This program is actually of limited utility: it can only  change  the
       tilt by shearing with the X and Z axis fixed, by some angle "around" the X axis, assuming that (X,Y,Z) is
       a right-handed frame.

       <b>teem-unu</b>: Utah Nrrd Utilities command-line interface

       <b>teem-vprobe</b>:  Shows off the functionality of the gage library. Uses gageProbe() to query various kinds of
       volumes  to  learn  various   measured   or   derived   quantities.    Can   set   environment   variable
       TEEM_VPROBE_HACK_ZI to limit probing to a single z slice.
