</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XMPI - X Window MPI user interface

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       xmpi [-h] [&lt;boot_schema&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>XMPI</u>  is  a graphical user interface for running MPI programs, monitoring MPI processes and messages, and
       viewing execution trace files.  It exploits the debugging  capabilities  of  LAM,  a  parallel  computing
       environment for UNIX clusters.  <u>XMPI</u> is constructed from the Motif widget set.

       <u>XMPI</u>  does  not  provide  an  interface  for  starting a LAM session.  This must be accomplished prior to
       running <u>XMPI</u>, which is itself a LAM program.  The boot schema from which LAM was started can (should)  be
       provided  to  <u>XMPI</u> so that it may be presented as an inventory of nodes on which programs may be run.  If
       <u>XMPI</u> is to be used only to view trace files then starting LAM is not required.

       This description assumes a basic knowledge of MPI.

</pre><h4><b>TYPICAL</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <u>XMPI</u> provides a graphical display of the state of the processes within an  MPI  application.   The  state
       information  is  obtained  from  one  of  two  sources,  a  running application started by XMPI or a file
       containing trace data from a traced MPI application.  When <u>XMPI</u> is started, its top-level overview window
       is blank.  Once an application is started or a trace file is loaded the  overview  window  fills  with  a
       tiled  group  of hexagons, each representing the state of one MPI process and labeled by the process rank
       within MPI_COMM_WORLD.  A traffic light symbol indicates whether the process is running or  blocked.   No
       traffic light is shown for processes which have either finalized or not yet initialized the MPI library.

       When  monitoring  a  running application the camera "Snap" button or "Snapshot" item in the "Application"
       menu updates the state information on all processes at any time.   When  viewing  trace  data  the  state
       information is updated according to the currently selected time point (see "XMPI TRACE FILES").

       A  mouse  click  inside a hexagon pops up an additional window containing more detailed information about
       the process.  If the process is blocked, the function name, peer process rank, communicator, message  tag
       and  element  count  are displayed.  If unreceived messages are available, their quantity, source process
       rank, communicator, message tag and element count are displayed.  By leaving a few process windows on the
       screen, a user can focus debugging on a small and manageable collection of misbehaving processes.

       The "Clean" button or  "Clean"  item  in  the  "Application"  menu  terminates  an  application  and  the
       development  cycle  can  be  repeated.   The previous application can be rerun with the "Rerun" button or
       "Rerun" item in the "Application" menu.

</pre><h4><b>RUNNING</b> <b>AN</b> <b>APPLICATION</b></h4><pre>
       An application schema specifies an MPI application  by  listing  each  process's  program  name,  program
       location, target processor(s) and optional command line arguments.

       The  "Browse&amp;Run" item in the "Application" menu pops up a simple file browser for choosing and running a
       pre-written application schema.  Alternatively an application schema can  be  configured  with  the  <u>XMPI</u>
       application builder dialog, invoked by the "Build&amp;Run" item in the "Application" menu.

       The  builder  dialog has an area to specify each process and an arrow button to add it to the application
       schema, which is shown below the arrow button in a scrolled list.  The lines in the list show the  syntax
       that  would be used in creating the same application with a text editor.  Indeed, the "Save" button saves
       the application schema in a file for later use and/or editing.

       A specified process does not become part of the application until the arrow (commit) button  is  pressed.
       Once  it  appears in the application scrolled list, a process can be deleted by selecting it and pressing
       the &lt;Delete&gt; key.

       Pressing the "Run" button with anything in the application list causes that application to be  run.   The
       overview window is then initialized with the status of the application.

   <b>Program</b> <b>Specification</b>
       A  file  browser  in the middle of the builder dialog aids in selecting a program file.  The browser only
       navigates the file space of the node running <u>XMPI</u>.  If a program is located on another node  outside  the
       file  space  (outside  NFS,  etc.) its pathname may need to be typed into the process specification area.
       Selecting the "Use Full Pathname" toggle button will cause programs to be  placed  into  the  application
       schema as full pathnames.

       <u>XMPI</u>  limits  the  choice  of a program source node to either the node running <u>XMPI</u> or the process target
       node.  The latter case is the default and is the most efficient because LAM does not need to transfer the
       program from source to target node.  The "Transfer Program" toggle button selects the source node policy.

   <b>Multiple</b> <b>Program</b> <b>Copies</b>
       The number of copies of a program to be run can be set in the process specification  area.   Clicking  on
       the  increment  or  decrement arrow will increment or decrement the count by one. Clicking with the shift
       key down will increment or decrement by ten.

   <b>Command-line</b> <b>Arguments</b>
       Command-line arguments must be typed into the process specification area.

   <b>Node</b> <b>Specification</b>
       A boot schema specifies the computers participating as nodes in a LAM multicomputer.  If <u>XMPI</u> is given  a
       boot  schema  filename,  its  contents  will  appear  in a scrolled list on the right side of the builder
       dialog.  <u>XMPI</u> will search for the given schema in the local  directory.   The  boot  schema  filename  is
       displayed above the list of its nodes.  Multiple target nodes can be selected from the scrolled list with
       the  corresponding  node mnemonic appearing in the process specification area.  Selecting multiple target
       nodes specifies multiple processes with the program name, arguments and source node policy held constant.

       If no boot schema was specified only the special node selectors "LOCAL" (meaning the node on  which  <u>XMPI</u>
       is running) and "ALL NODES" are provided.

       Target  node descriptions may also be typed directly into the process specification area.  The local node
       is specified as <u>h</u>.  The origin node from which the machine was booted, if not local, can be specified  as
       <u>o</u>.   All  usable nodes are specified as <u>N</u>.  Nodes are generically identified as <u>n&lt;list&gt;,</u> where &lt;list&gt; can
       be a single node identifier or a list of node identifiers.  Identifiers can  be  written  in  decimal  or
       hexadecimal notation.  Examples are <u>n1</u> or <u>n0-7,0x10</u>.

   <b>Run-time</b> <b>Options</b>
       Applications can be run with various run-time options to specify the behaviour of the MPI library.  These
       can  be  configured  from  a  separate dialog which is activated from the "Runtime" item in the "Options"
       menu.  Options remain in effect until changed.

       •      tracing mode (default enabled)

       •      fast client-to-client communication (default disabled)

       •      GER protocol and error detection (default enabled)

       •      homogeneous LAM node optimization (default disabled)

</pre><h4><b>FOCUSING</b> <b>ON</b> <b>A</b> <b>PROCESS</b></h4><pre>
       More information on a process's state can be obtained by  clicking  the  left  mouse  button  within  the
       process  hexagon.   This  will  pop up a focus window.  The upper area of the focus window is the process
       area and displays the current state of the process.  The lower area is  the  message  area  and  displays
       information on the process's message queue.

       The  focus  window  banner  contains a tack button which can be clicked to dismiss the window and a label
       containing the process's identity along with the program name.  In <u>XMPI</u> processes are identified first by
       their rank in MPI_COMM_WORLD and if the process is communicating, with a slash followed by the  process's
       rank  within  the current communicator.  The focus window can also be dismissed by clicking once again in
       the process hexagon.

       The process area describes the current state of  the  process  together  with  the  name  of  and  (where
       appropriate)  arguments  to  the  MPI  function  currently  being  executed.   The layout is fairly self-
       explanatory and we describe only the less obvious features.

   <b>Communicator</b> <b>Identification</b>
       The "comm" area shows the communicator being used in the current MPI function.  Communicators are  opaque
       objects  which  MPI  does not identify in any meaningful, printable way.  LAM's MPI implementation adds a
       simple numerical identifier to communicators,  which  is  displayed  in  <u>XMPI</u>  as  &lt;x&gt;  where  <u>x</u>  is  the
       identifier.   This  identifier  can  be  matched to communicator variables in an MPI program with the LAM
       function, <a href="../man2/MPIL_Comm_id.2.html">MPIL_Comm_id</a>(2).

   <b>Group</b> <b>Membership</b>
       The button to the right of the "comm" area will highlight in the overview  window  the  hexagons  of  the
       processes  in  the communicator.  For an intracommunicator, the hexagons will be highlighted in the color
       specified by the "lcomCol" resource.  For an intercommunicator, processes in  the  local  group  will  be
       highlighted  in  the color specified by the "lcomCol" resource and those in the remote group in the color
       specified by the "rcomCol" resource.  For highlighted processes the process identification at the  bottom
       of  the  hexagon  is  changed  to  be  the rank in MPI_COMM_WORLD followed by a slash and the rank in the
       communicator being highlighted.

   <b>Datatype</b>
       The datatype button to the right of the "cnt" area will display in the  datatype  window  (see  "DATATYPE
       WINDOW") the type map of the datatype argument to the current MPI function.

       The message area describes the current state of the queue of messages destined to the process and not yet
       received.   Once  again  the  layout  is  fairly  self-explanatory  and we describe only the less obvious
       features.

   <b>Message</b> <b>Aggregates</b>
       Identical undelivered messages are aggregated. The "copy" area shows the number of  messages  within  the
       visible aggregate, followed by the total number of messages in the queue.  The button to the right of the
       "copy" area cycles through the message aggregates.

   <b>Source</b> <b>Rank</b>
       The  "src"  area  shows  the rank of the source process within MPI_COMM_WORLD followed by the rank of the
       source process in the communicator in which the message was sent.

   <b>Datatype</b>
       The datatype button to the right of the "cnt" area will display in the datatype window the  type  map  of
       the message's datatype.

   <b>Group</b> <b>Membership</b>
       The  button  to  the  right  of  the  "comm"  area  will highlight the message communicator in the manner
       previously described.

</pre><h4><b>XMPI</b> <b>TRACE</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>XMPI</u> can be used to view existing trace files and can be used to create trace files for applications  run
       under <u>XMPI</u>.

       To load and view an existing trace file select the "View" item in the "Trace" menu.

       If  an  application is run under <u>XMPI</u> with tracing enabled (the default), LAM will trace the application.
       Before the trace data can be viewed in <u>XMPI</u> it must be dumped to a file.  This is done by  selecting  the
       "Dump" item from the "Trace" menu.  You will be prompted for a file name.  By convention <u>XMPI</u> trace files
       have  a  ".lamtr"  suffix.  The trace file can be viewed by loading it as described above.  As a shortcut
       select the "Express" item in the "Trace" menu, or equivalently click the "Trace" button in  the  overview
       window.   This  dumps the trace data to a temporary file and then immediately loads the file for viewing.
       If you decide that you want to save trace data for later viewing then you must dump it using  the  "Dump"
       item  from  the  "Trace" menu.  Dumping trace data to file does not purge any trace data and a subsequent
       dump will contain all the trace data from the start of the application up  until  the  time  of  dumping.
       Terminating an application via the "Clean" button or menu item purges all trace data.

       While  viewing  a  trace  an  application previously launched by XMPI continues to run in the background.
       Upon the closing of the trace window XMPI will return to snapshot mode if there is a running application.

       When loading trace files containing multiple segments (see <a href="../man2/MPIL_Trace_on.2.html">MPIL_Trace_on</a>(2)  and  <a href="../man2/MPIL_Trace_off.2.html">MPIL_Trace_off</a>(2))  you
       will  be  prompted for the number of the segment you wish to view.  If you wish later to view a different
       segment, simply reload the trace file and specify the new segment number  when  prompted.   Reloading  is
       done via the "View" or "Express" items in the "Trace" menu.

   <b>Communication</b> <b>Timeline</b> <b>Window</b>
       Across  the  top  of  the timeline window is a control and information area.  The trace data is displayed
       below this on timelines, one per process in the traced application.  The state of the  application  at  a
       particular  time  is represented by the corresponding traffic light color.  Green represents running, red
       represents blocked waiting on communication and yellow represents time spent inside an MPI  function  not
       blocked  on  communication  (we call this system overhead time as it typically represents time doing data
       conversion, message packing, etc).

       The dial can be used to select a time point at which the process states are  to  be  displayed.   In  the
       overview window the process states at the dial time are displayed in hexagon form.  As with snapshot mode
       more  detailed information on a process can be obtained by bringing up its focus window.  The dial may be
       moved by clicking with the left button in the trace view area or via the VCR  controls.   Below  the  VCR
       controls  are  displayed  from  left  to  right, the time of the left edge of the displayed timeline, the
       current dial time and the time of the right edge of the displayed timeline.

       To the right of the VCR controls is displayed the current magnification.  When a  trace  file  is  loaded
       <u>XMPI</u>  chooses  an initial scaling factor and sets this to be the 1x1 magnification.  You can increase and
       decrease the magnification using the zoom and un-zoom buttons.

       A segment of the currently displayed timeline can be selected by dragging the right mouse button  in  the
       timeline  display  area.   Upon  release  of  the right button the display is zoomed to show the selected
       segment.  To cancel a drag in progress, drag the cursor up or down out of the timeline display area.

   <b>How</b> <b>Communication</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Represented</b>
       <u>Collective</u>
           A collective communication is represented for each process by contiguous line  segments  showing  the
           time  spent  in  system  overhead and the time spent blocked waiting for communication.  No lines are
           drawn connecting the processes participating in the collective communication.

       <u>Blocking_point_to_point</u>
           For both the send and receive process contiguous line segments are drawn showing the  time  spent  in
           system  overhead  and  the  time  spent blocked waiting for the communication to complete.  A line is
           drawn connecting the send to the receive.  It originates at the beginning of the send segments and is
           drawn to the end of the matching receive segments.

       <u>Non-blocking_point_to_point</u>
           At the time a non-blocking send or receive is initiated a system overhead segment is drawn.  When the
           communication is completed via a wait or test, segments showing system overhead and blocking time are
           drawn.  Lines are drawn between matching sends and receives, except in this case the  line  is  drawn
           from the segment where the send was initiated to where the corresponding receive completed.

       <u>Waits_and_tests</u>
           If  a non-blocking communication is completed inside a wait/test function <u>XMPI</u> will show the function
           name in the focus window as the wait/test  function  followed  in  parentheses  by  the  send/receive
           function  being  completed.   For  example, if an MPI_Issend() is completed inside an MPI_Wait(), the
           function will read <u>MPI_Wait</u> <u>(MPI_Issend)</u>.

       <u>Missing_traces</u>
           Owing to the use of trace segments or the dropping of overflow traces (see <a href="../man1/lamtrace.1.html">lamtrace</a>(1)) there may  be
           send  or  receive  traces which have no match in the trace data.  In these cases a short stub line is
           drawn out from a send or in to a receive.

   <b>Kiviat</b> <b>Window</b>
       When viewing a trace file,  the "Kiviat" button or "Kiviat" item from the  "Trace"  menu  brings  up  the
       Kiviat  window.   This  window  displays,  in a segmented pie-chart format, the cumulative time up to the
       current dial time, spent by each process in the running, overhead and blocked states.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGE</b> <b>SOURCE</b> <b>MATRIX</b></h4><pre>
       The message source window displays a square matrix of process message queue lengths.  For each process it
       shows the number of queued messages from each other process in the application.  It  can  be  brought  up
       while monitoring a running application or while viewing a trace file, by selecting the "Matrix" button or
       "Matrix" item in the "Trace" menu.

</pre><h4><b>DATATYPE</b> <b>WINDOW</b></h4><pre>
       The datatype window displays a textual representation of the type map of an MPI datatype.  This window is
       associated  at  any  instant  with a particular process and mode.  The associated process is shown in the
       window's banner and the mode is indicated by a traffic light or message queue icon shown in the left part
       of the window.  When in process mode the datatype being shown, if any, is the datatype  argument  of  the
       MPI  function the process is executing.  When in message mode the datatype is that of the current message
       aggregate selected in the process focus window.  Switching between processes and modes  is  effected  via
       the datatype buttons in the process focus windows.

       The  type map might not fit completely into the default size window.  Simply resize the window to see the
       whole map.

</pre><h4><b>SWITCHING</b> <b>INFORMATION</b> <b>SOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>XMPI</u> will gather and display information from either the currently executing application or a trace file.
       When an application is launched from <u>XMPI</u>, the information source is the executing  application  and  the
       "Snap"  button is active.  Though the application may be producing trace data, the "Snap" button does not
       use it, but instead acquires information from debugging hooks in the MPI implementation.  At any  moment,
       an  existing  trace  file may be loaded into <u>XMPI</u> or the currently accumulating trace data may be fetched
       from the MPI implementation, stored in a file, and loaded.  This action changes the information source to
       the loaded trace file.  Information display is now controlled from the dial in the  timeline  window  and
       not  from  the  "Snap"  button,  which is now inactive.  Though the application may still be running, the
       timeline dial does not use the runtime debugging hooks, but instead acquires information from the  loaded
       trace file.  Upon the closing of the trace window XMPI will return to snapshot mode if there is a running
       application.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>XMPI</u> defines the following application resources.

       XMPI.helpCmd        command  that is run to provide help.  The default is typically a command which fires
                           up a Web browser to view a  help  page.   You  should  change  this  to  invoke  your
                           favourite browser.

       XMPI.rankFont       process rank font in hexagon

       XMPI.msgFont        total  message  count  font in hexagon (may need to be adjusted to fit inside message
                           icon)

       XMPI.lcomCol        color used to highlight the processes in an intracommunicator or  in  the  the  local
                           group of an intercommunicator

       XMPI.rcomCol        color used to highlight the processes in the remote group of an intercommunicator

       XMPI.bandCol        color used for the zoom selection rubber band

       XMPI.bandDash       if  True  use  a  dashed  line rubber band to show the zoom selection otherwise use a
                           solid line

       XMPI.bandWidth      width of the zoom selection rubber band

       <u>XMPI</u> gets important default resources from the application defaults file, XMPI.   If  this  file  is  not
       installed  in  the  X11  default  directory,  its  directory  can be added to the XAPPLRESDIR environment
       variable.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       An application must be started by <u>XMPI</u> to be monitored by it.

       When using the fast client-to-client communication mode process states in snapshot mode are always  shown
       as running and no useful information is shown in the process focus windows.

       <u>XMPI</u>  uses  <a href="../man1/lamclean.1.html">lamclean</a>(1).   Errors  reported  by this tool will still print to standard output.  A shorter
       message will appear in an <u>XMPI</u> error dialog.
