</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pcp-tapestat</b> - report tape I/O statistics

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pcp</b> [<u>pcp</u> <u>options</u>] <b>tapestat</b> [<b>-u?</b>]  [<b>-G</b> <u>method</u>] [<b>-P</b> <u>precision</u>] [<b>-R</b> <u>pattern</u>] [<b>-x</b> [t][,h][,noidle]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pcp-tapestat</b> reports I/O statistics for tape devices.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       When  invoked  via  the <b><a href="../man1/pcp.1.html">pcp</a></b>(1) command, the <u>pcp</u> <u>options</u> <b>-A</b>/<b>--align</b>, <b>-a</b>/<b>--archive</b>, <b>-h</b>/<b>--host</b>, <b>-O</b>/<b>--origin</b>,
       <b>-S</b>/<b>--start</b>, <b>-s</b>/<b>--samples</b>,  <b>-t</b>/<b>--interval</b>,  <b>-T</b>/<b>--finish</b>,  <b>-V</b>/<b>--version</b>,  <b>-Z</b>/<b>--timezone</b>  and  <b>-z</b>/<b>--hostzone</b>
       become indirectly available; refer to <b><a href="../man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro</a></b>(1) for a complete description of these options.

       The additional command line options available for <b>pcp-tapestat</b> are:

       <b>-G</b> <u>method</u>, <b>--aggregate</b>=<u>method</u>
            Specifies  that  statistics  for  device names matching the regular expression specified with the <b>-R</b>
            <u>regex</u> option should be aggregated according to <u>method</u>.  Note this is aggregation based  on  matching
            device  names  (not  temporal  aggregation).  When <b>-G</b> is used, the device name column is reported as
            <u>method</u>(<u>regex</u>), e.g.  if <b>-G</b> <b>sum</b> <b>-R</b> <b>'st(0|1)$'</b> is specified, the device column will  be  <b>sum</b>(<b>st(0|1)$)</b>
            and summed statistics for <b>st0</b> and <b>st1</b> will be reported in the remaining columns.  If <b>-G</b> is specified
            but <b>-R</b> is not specified, then the default <u>regex</u> is <b>.*</b>, i.e. matching all device names.  If <u>method</u> is
            <b>sum</b>  then  the  statistics  are  summed.   If  <u>method</u> is <b>avg</b> then the statistics are summed and then
            averaged by dividing by the number of matching device names.  If <u>method</u> is <b>min</b> or <b>max</b>,  the  minimum
            or maximum statistics for matching devices are reported, respectively.

       <b>-P</b> <u>N</u>, <b>--precision</b>=<u>N</u>
            This  indicates  the precision (number of decimal places) to report.  The default precision <u>N</u> may be
            set to something other than the default (2).  Note that the <b>avgrq-sz</b> and <b>avgqu-sz</b> fields are  always
            reported with <u>N</u>+1 decimals of precision.  These fields typically have values less than 1.

       <b>-R</b> <u>pattern</u>, <b>--regex</b>=<u>pattern</u>
            This  restricts the report to device names matching a regular expression <u>pattern</u>.  The given <u>pattern</u>
            is searched as a perl style regular expression, and will match any portion of a device  name.   e.g.
            '^st[0-9]+'  will  match  all device names starting with 'st' followed by one or more numbers.  e.g.
            '^st(0|1)$' will only match 'st0' and 'st1'.  e.g. 'st0$' will match 'st0' but not 'st1'.  See  also
            the <b>-G</b> option for aggregation options.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--no-interpolation</b>
            When  replaying  a set of archives, by default values are reported according to the requested sample
            interval (<b>-t</b> option), not according to the actual interval recorded in the archive(s).  Without this
            option PCP interpolates the values to be reported based on the records in the set of archives, which
            is particularly useful when the <b>-t</b> option is used to replay a set of archives with a longer sampling
            interval than that with which the archive(s) was originally recorded  with.   With  the  <b>-u</b>  option,
            uninterpolated  reporting  is  enabled  -  every value is reported according to the native recording
            interval in the set of archives.  When the <b>-u</b> option is specified, the <b>-t</b> option makes no sense  and
            is  incompatible because the replay interval is always the same as the recording interval in the set
            of archive.  In addition, <b>-u</b> only makes  sense  when  replaying  archives,  see  the  <b>-a</b>  option  on
            <b><a href="../man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro</a></b>(1), and so if <b>-u</b> is specified then <b>-a</b> must also be specified.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
            Display version number and exit.

       <b>-x</b> <u>comma-separated-options</u>
            Specifies a comma-separated list of one or more extended reporting options as follows:
            <b>t</b> - prefix every line in the report with a timestamp in <u><a href="../man3/ctime.3.html">ctime</a></u>(3) format,
            <b>h</b> - omit the heading, which is otherwise reported every 24 samples,
            <b>noidle</b> - Do not display statistics for idle devices.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.

</pre><h4><b>REPORT</b></h4><pre>
       The columns in the <b>pcp-tapestat</b> report have the following interpretation:

       <b>Timestamp</b>
              When the <b>-x</b> <b>t</b> option is specified, this column is the timestamp in <b><a href="../man3/ctime.3.html">ctime</a></b>(3) format.

       <b>Device</b> Specifies  the tape device name.  When <b>-G</b> is specified, this is replaced by the aggregation method
              and regular expression - see the <b>-G</b> and <b>-R</b> options above.

       <b>r/s</b>    The number of reads issued expressed as the number per second averaged over the interval.

       <b>w/s</b>    The number of writes issued expressed as the number per second averaged over the interval.

       <b>kb_r/s</b> The amount of data read expressed in kilobytes per second averaged over the interval.

       <b>kb_w/s</b> The amount of data written expressed in kilobytes per second averaged over the interval.

       <b>r_pct</b>  Read percentage wait - the percentage of time over the interval spent waiting for read requests to
              complete.  The time is measured from when the request is dispatched to the SCSI mid-layer until it
              signals that it completed.

       <b>w_pct</b>  Write percentage wait - the percentage of time over the interval spent waiting for write  requests
              to complete.  The time is measured from when the request is dispatched to the SCSI mid-layer until
              it signals that it completed.

       <b>o_pct</b>  Overall  percentage  wait  -  the  percentage  of time over the interval spent waiting for any I/O
              request to complete (read, write, and other).

       <b>Rs/s</b>   The number of I/Os, expressed as the number per second averaged over the interval,  where  a  non-
              zero residual value was encountered.

       <b>o_cnt</b>  The   number  of  I/Os,  expressed  as the number per second averaged over the interval, that were
              included as "other".  Other I/O includes  ioctl  calls  made  to  the  tape  driver  and  implicit
              operations  performed  by the tape driver such as rewind on close (for tape devices that implement
              rewind on close).  It does not include any I/O performed using methods outside of the tape  driver
              (e.g. via sg ioctls).

</pre><h4><b>PCP</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Environment  variables with the prefix <b>PCP_</b> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by
       PCP.  On each installation, the file <u>/etc/pcp.conf</u> contains the local values for  these  variables.   The
       <b>$PCP_CONF</b> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <b><a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf</a></b>(5).

       For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see <b><a href="../man3/pmGetOptions.3.html">pmGetOptions</a></b>(3).
