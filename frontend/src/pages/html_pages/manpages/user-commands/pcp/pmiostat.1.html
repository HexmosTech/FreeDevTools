</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pmiostat</b>, <b>pcp-iostat</b> - report block I/O statistics

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pcp</b> [<u>pcp</u> <u>options</u>] <b>iostat</b> [<b>-u?</b>]  [<b>-G</b> <u>method</u>] [<b>-P</b> <u>precision</u>] [<b>-R</b> <u>pattern</u>] [<b>-x</b> [dm][,t][,h][,noidle]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pcp-iostat</b> reports I/O statistics for SCSI (by default) or other devices (if the <b>-x</b> option is specified).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       When  invoked  via  the <b><a href="../man1/pcp.1.html">pcp</a></b>(1) command, the <u>pcp</u> <u>options</u> <b>-A</b>/<b>--align</b>, <b>-a</b>/<b>--archive</b>, <b>-h</b>/<b>--host</b>, <b>-O</b>/<b>--origin</b>,
       <b>-S</b>/<b>--start</b>, <b>-s</b>/<b>--samples</b>,  <b>-T</b>/<b>--finish</b>,  <b>-t</b>/<b>--interval</b>,  <b>-v</b>/<b>--version</b>,  <b>-Z</b>/<b>--timezone</b>  and  <b>-z</b>/<b>--hostzone</b>
       become indirectly available; refer to <b><a href="../man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro</a></b>(1) for a complete description of these options.

       The additional command line options available for <b>pcp-iostat</b> are:

       <b>-G</b> <u>method</u>, <b>--aggregate</b>=<u>method</u>
            Specifies  that  statistics  for  device names matching the regular expression specified with the <b>-R</b>
            <u>regex</u> option should be aggregated according to <u>method</u>.  Note this is aggregation based  on  matching
            device  names  (not  temporal  aggregation).  When <b>-G</b> is used, the device name column is reported as
            <u>method</u>(<u>regex</u>), e.g.  if <b>-G</b> <b>sum</b> <b>-R</b> <b>'sd(a|b)$'</b> is specified, the device column will  be  <b>sum</b>(<b>sd(a|b)$)</b>
            and summed statistics for <b>sda</b> and <b>sdb</b> will be reported in the remaining columns.  If <b>-G</b> is specified
            but <b>-R</b> is not specified, then the default <u>regex</u> is <b>.*</b>, i.e. matching all device names.  If <u>method</u> is
            <b>sum</b> then the statistics are summed.  This includes the <b>%util</b> column, which may therefore exceed 100%
            if  more than one device name matches.  If <u>method</u> is <b>avg</b> then the statistics are summed and then av‐
            eraged by dividing by the number of matching device names.  If <u>method</u> is <b>min</b> or <b>max</b>, the minimum  or
            maximum statistics for matching devices are reported, respectively.

       <b>-P</b> <u>N</u>, <b>--precision</b>=<u>N</u>
            This  indicates  the precision (number of decimal places) to report.  The default precision <u>N</u> may be
            set to something other than the default (2).  Note that the <b>avgrq-sz</b> and <b>avgqu-sz</b> fields are  always
            reported with <u>N</u>+1 decimals of precision.  These fields typically have values less than 1.

       <b>-R</b> <u>pattern</u>, <b>--regex</b>=<u>pattern</u>
            This  restricts the report to device names matching a regular expression <u>pattern</u>.  The given <u>pattern</u>
            is searched as a perl style regular expression, and will match any portion of a device  name.   e.g.
            '^sd[a-zA-Z]+'  will  match  all  device names starting with 'sd' followed by one or more alphabetic
            characters.  e.g. '^sd(a|b)$' will only match 'sda' and 'sdb'.  e.g. 'sda$' will match 'sda' but not
            'sdab'.  See also the <b>-G</b> option for aggregation options.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--no-interpolation</b>
            When replaying a set of archives, by default values are reported according to the  requested  sample
            interval (<b>-t</b> option), not according to the actual interval recorded in the archive(s).  Without this
            option PCP interpolates the values to be reported based on the records in the set of archives, which
            is particularly useful when the <b>-t</b> option is used to replay a set of archives with a longer sampling
            interval  than that with which the archive(s) was originally recorded with.  With the <b>-u</b> option, un‐
            interpolated reporting is enabled - every value is reported according to the native recording inter‐
            val in the set of archives.  When the <b>-u</b> option is specified, the <b>-t</b> option makes no  sense  and  is
            incompatible  because the replay interval is always the same as the recording interval in the set of
            archive.  In addition, <b>-u</b> only makes sense when replaying archives, see  the  <b>-a</b>  option  on  <b>PCPIn‐</b>
            <b><a href="../man1/tro.1.html">tro</a></b>(1), and so if <b>-u</b> is specified then <b>-a</b> must also be specified.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
            Display version number and exit.

       <b>-x</b> <u>comma-separated-options</u>
            Specifies a comma-separated list of one or more extended reporting options as follows:
            <b>dm</b> - report statistics for device-mapper logical devices instead of SCSI devices,
            <b>t</b> - prefix every line in the report with a timestamp in <u><a href="../man3/ctime.3.html">ctime</a></u>(3) format,
            <b>h</b> - omit the heading, which is otherwise reported every 24 samples,
            <b>noidle</b> - Do not display statistics for idle devices.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.

</pre><h4><b>REPORT</b></h4><pre>
       The columns in the <b>pcp-iostat</b> report have the following interpretation:

       <b>Timestamp</b>
              When the <b>-x</b> <b>t</b> option is specified, this column is the timestamp in <b><a href="../man3/ctime.3.html">ctime</a></b>(3) format.

       <b>Device</b> Specifies  the  scsi device name, or if <b>-x</b> <b>dm</b> is specified, the device-mapper logical device name.
              When <b>-G</b> is specified, this is replaced by the aggregation method and regular expression - see  the
              <b>-G</b> and <b>-R</b> options above.

       <b>rrqm/s</b> The  number  of read requests expressed as a rate per-second that were merged during the reporting
              interval by the I/O scheduler.

       <b>wrqm/s</b> The number of write requests expressed as a rate per-second that were merged during the  reporting
              interval by the I/O scheduler.

       <b>r/s</b>    The number of read requests completed by the device (after merges), expressed as a rate per second
              during the reporting interval.

       <b>w/s</b>    The  number of write requests completed by the device (after merges), expressed as a rate per sec‐
              ond during the reporting interval.

       <b>rkB/s</b>  The average volume of data read from the device expressed as KBytes/second  during  the  reporting
              interval.

       <b>wkB/s</b>  The  average  volume of data written to the device expressed as KBytes/second during the reporting
              interval.

       <b>avgrq-sz</b>
              The average I/O request size for both reads and writes to the device expressed  as  Kbytes  during
              the reporting interval.

       <b>avgqu-sz</b>
              The average queue length of read and write requests to the device during the reporting interval.

       <b>await</b>  The  average  time  in milliseconds that read and write requests were queued (and serviced) to the
              device during the reporting interval.

       <b>r_await</b>
              The average time in milliseconds that read requests were queued (and serviced) to the device  dur‐
              ing the reporting interval.

       <b>w_await</b>
              The average time in milliseconds that write requests were queued (and serviced) to the device dur‐
              ing the reporting interval.

       <b>%util</b>  The percentage of time during the reporting interval that the device was busy processing requests.
              A value of 100% indicates device saturation.

</pre><h4><b>PCP</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Environment  variables with the prefix <b>PCP_</b> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by
       PCP.  On each installation, the file <u>/etc/pcp.conf</u> contains the local values for  these  variables.   The
       <b>$PCP_CONF</b> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <b><a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf</a></b>(5).

       For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see <b><a href="../man3/pmGetOptions.3.html">pmGetOptions</a></b>(3).
