</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>decopy</b> - Automatic debian/copyright generator

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>decopy</b> [options] [files or dirs]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Decopy is a tool that automates creating and updating the debian/copyright files. It does this by parsing
       all  files  in  a  source  tree,  figuring  out the copyright attribution and license for each file (when
       possible) and then structuring the output in the copyright format 1.0.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Simply running <b>decopy</b> in the source tree that needs to be parsed will process  all  files  in  the  tree,
       group  them  by  license,  wildcard  those  groups  and  generate  the proper output to be written to the
       debian/copyright file.

       If the source tree already includes a debian/copyright file, it will be used as input for files where the
       license could not be inferred, for the copyright of the debian directory and  for  the  license  snippets
       (which need to be filled in manually if there is no debian/copyright file).

       The  files  or  directories  specified as positional arguments can be used to limit the processing to the
       indicated subset instead of processing the complete source tree.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       On top of the simple <b>decopy</b> usage, these examples show some of the most common usecases. Please  see  the
       following sections for detailed explanations of what each of the parameters do.

       <b>decopy</b> <b>--root</b> <b>src/hello-1.0/</b> <b>--output</b> <b>src/hello-1.0/debian/copyright</b>
              This  runs  the parser in the hello-1.0 source tree and generates the debian/copyright file in the
              source tree (the debian/ directory needs to pre-exist this call).

       <b>decopy</b> <b>--mode</b> <b>partial</b> <b>src/3rdparty/ninja</b>
              This shows the licensing and copyright information for the <b>src/3rdparty/ninja</b> directory. Only that
              directory is analized and the output includes only files contained in it.

       <b>decopy</b> <b>--group-by</b> <b>copyright</b>
              This processes the complete current source tree, paragraphs are split not only  according  to  the
              licenses but also according to the copyright owners.

       <b>decopy</b> <b>src</b>
              This  will  process  the  src  directory  but,  provided debian/copyright already exists, show the
              complete updated debian/copyright file.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--mode</b> <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>
              Indicates the mode to use when generating the output. The <b>full</b>  mode  (default)  will  generate  a
              complete  debian/copyright  file, even if only some files were processed (the rest of the contents
              are taken from the original debian/copyright file). While the <b>partial</b> mode  will  only  print  the
              copyright and licensing information for the indicated files.

       <b>--output</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>, <b>-o</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Store  the  generated  output  in  the  indicated file. This will overwrite the file if it already
              exists.

       <b>--root</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Process the indicated path instead of the current directory.

</pre><h4><b>GROUPING</b> <b>CRITERIA</b></h4><pre>
       The generated output will always create separate paragraphs for groups of files with different  licenses,
       additionally, it can also split paragraphs according to the following grouping options.

       <b>--group-by</b> <b>&lt;criteria&gt;</b>
              When  grouping by <b>license</b> (default), all copyright owners of different files with the same license
              are listed together. When grouping by <b>copyright</b>, each  different  group  of  copyright  owners  is
              listed separatedly (files that have the exact same list of copyright owners are listed together).

       <b>--split-on-license</b>
              When  a  subdirectory  has its own license file (COPYING, LICENSE, etc), the subdirectory is given
              its own paragraph, even if it has the same license as the main directory. This is the default.

       <b>--no-split-on-license</b>
              Even if a subdirectory has its own license file, the contents are listed together with other files
              in the tree that have the same license.

       <b>--split-debian</b>
              Even if the contents of the debian/ subdirectory have the same license as the main content,  split
              it onto a separate paragraph. This is the default.

       <b>--no-split-debian</b>
              If  the  contents  of the debian/ subdirectory have the same license as the main content, they are
              listed together.

</pre><h4><b>LOG</b> <b>LEVEL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The default logging shows WARN and ERROR messages. It can be modified with the following flags:

       <b>--debug</b>
              Show DEBUG, INFO, WARN and ERROR messages.

       <b>--verbose</b>, <b>-v</b>
              Show INFO, WARN and ERROR messages.

       <b>--quiet</b>, <b>-q</b>
              Show only ERROR messages.

</pre><h4><b>LESS</b> <b>COMMON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--copyright-file</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Specify a different copyright file  to  be  used  as  a  base  for  the  processing.  Defaults  to
              <b>debian/copyright</b>

       <b>--text</b> Parse  all files as text files, instead of using the different parsers according to the file types
              (e.g. using exiftool for images).

       <b>--exclude</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>, <b>-X</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Exclude files from being parsed. The path can be specified as a regular expression that is matched
              against the full relative path for the file (e.g. <b>-X</b> <b>'.*\.jpg$'</b> to exclude all files that have the
              <b>.jpg</b> extension. or <b>-X</b> <b>doc/</b> to exclude all files inside the <b>doc/</b> directory).  As  a  special  case,
              <b>debian/copyright</b> and <b>debian/changelog</b> are always excluded..

</pre><h4><b>COMPARISON</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>HELPERS</b></h4><pre>
       Decopy   was   inspired   by  previous  copyright  helpers  like  copyright-helper  by  Modestas  Vainius
       <u>https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/users/modax/copyright-helper.git/</u>, <a href="../man1/licensecheck.1.html">licensecheck</a>(1) by  Jonas  Smedegaard,
       or the copyright helper shipped with <a href="../man1/debmake.1.html">debmake</a>(1), written by Osamu Aoki.

       The  main  difference  with  all  of  them,  is that decopy aims to detects as many licenses as possible,
       including many more that those in the other helpers, as well as the fact that it's capable of  processing
       more than just plain text files.

       Additionally,  while it is possible to use it for the creation of the copyright file, its main usecase is
       to keep the copyright file updated with any changes that are done to the source tree as time passes.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       Decopy was written by Maximiliano Curia. The debian packaging and this manpage were created by  Margarita
       Manterola.

</pre><h4><b>COPYRIGHT</b></h4><pre>
       Decopy and all the associated code and documentation are released under the ISC license.
