</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       The  GNU implementation of <u>refer</u> is part of the <u><a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff</a></u>(1) document formatting system.  <u>refer</u> is a <u><a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff</a></u>(1)
       preprocessor that prepares bibilographic citations by looking up keywords specified in  a  <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7)  input
       document,  obviating  the  need  to type such annotations, and permitting the citation style in formatted
       output to be altered independently and systematically.  It copies  the  contents  of  each  <u>file</u>  to  the
       standard  output  stream, except that it interprets lines between <b>.[</b> and <b>.]</b> as citations to be translated
       into <u>groff</u> input, and lines between <b>.R1</b> and <b>.R2</b>  as  instructions  regarding  how  citations  are  to  be
       processed.  Normally, <u>refer</u> is not executed directly by the user, but invoked by specifying the <b>-R</b> option
       to  <u><a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff</a></u>(1).   If  no <u>file</u> operands are given on the command line, or if <u>file</u> is “<b>-</b>”, the standard input
       stream is read.

       Each citation specifies a reference.  The citation can  specify  a  reference  that  is  contained  in  a
       bibliographic  database  by giving a set of keywords that only that reference contains.  Alternatively it
       can specify a reference by supplying  a  database  record  in  the  citation.   A  combination  of  these
       alternatives is also possible.

       For  each  citation, <u>refer</u> can produce a mark in the text.  This mark consists of some label which can be
       separated from the text and from other labels in various  ways.   For  each  reference  it  also  outputs
       <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7)  language commands that can be used by a macro package to produce a formatted reference for each
       citation.  The output of <u>refer</u> must therefore be processed using a suitable macro package,  such  as  <u>me</u>,
       <u>mm</u>,  <u>mom</u>,  or  <u>ms</u>.   The  commands  to  format a citation's reference can be output immediately after the
       citation, or the references may be accumulated, and the commands output at  some  later  point.   If  the
       references are accumulated, then multiple citations of the same reference will produce a single formatted
       reference.

       The  interpretation  of  lines  between  <b>.R1</b> and <b>.R2</b> as prepreocessor commands is a feature of GNU <u>refer</u>.
       Documents making use of this feature can still be processed by AT&amp;T <u>refer</u> just by adding the lines
              .de R1
              .ig R2
              ..
       to the beginning of the document.  This will cause <u><a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff</a></u>(1) to ignore everything  between  <b>.R1</b>  and  <b>.R2</b>.
       The  effect  of  some  commands  can also be achieved by options.  These options are supported mainly for
       compatibility with AT&amp;T <u>refer</u>.  It is usually more convenient to use commands.

       <u>refer</u> generates <b>.lf</b> requests so that file names and line numbers in messages produced  by  commands  that
       read  <u>refer</u>  output  will  be correct; it also interprets lines beginning with <b>.lf</b> so that file names and
       line numbers in the messages and <b>.lf</b> lines that it produces will be accurate even if the input  has  been
       preprocessed by a command such as <u><a href="../man1/soelim.1.html">soelim</a></u>(1).

   <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>databases</b>
       The  bibliographic  database  is  a text file consisting of records separated by one or more blank lines.
       Within each record fields start with a <b>%</b> at the beginning of a line.  Each field has a one character name
       that immediately follows the <b>%</b>.  It is best to use only upper and lower case letters  for  the  names  of
       fields.   The  name of the field should be followed by exactly one space, and then by the contents of the
       field.  Empty fields are ignored.  The conventional meaning of each field is as follows:

       <b>%A</b>     The name of an author.  If the name contains a suffix such as “Jr.”, it should be  separated  from
              the  last  name  by  a  comma.   There  can be multiple occurrences of the <b>%A</b> field.  The order is
              significant.  It is a good idea always to supply an <b>%A</b> field or a <b>%Q</b> field.

       <b>%B</b>     For an article that is part of a book, the title of the book.

       <b>%C</b>     The place (city) of publication.

       <b>%D</b>     The date of publication.  The year should be specified in full.  If the month  is  specified,  the
              name  rather  than  the  number  of the month should be used, but only the first three letters are
              required.  It is a good idea always to supply a <b>%D</b> field; if the date is unknown, a value such  as
              <b>in</b> <b>press</b> or <b>unknown</b> can be used.

       <b>%E</b>     For  an  article  that  is  part of a book, the name of an editor of the book.  Where the work has
              editors and no authors, the names of the editors should be given as <b>%A</b> fields  and  “<b>,</b>  <b>(ed.)</b>”  or
              “<b>,</b> <b>(eds.)</b>” should be appended to the last author.

       <b>%G</b>     U.S. government ordering number.

       <b>%I</b>     The publisher (issuer).

       <b>%J</b>     For an article in a journal, the name of the journal.

       <b>%K</b>     Keywords to be used for searching.

       <b>%L</b>     Label.

       <b>%N</b>     Journal issue number.

       <b>%O</b>     Other information.  This is usually printed at the end of the reference.

       <b>%P</b>     Page number.  A range of pages can be specified as <u>m</u><b>-</b><u>n</u>.

       <b>%Q</b>     The  name of the author, if the author is not a person.  This will only be used if there are no <b>%A</b>
              fields.  There can only be one <b>%Q</b> field.

       <b>%R</b>     Technical report number.

       <b>%S</b>     Series name.

       <b>%T</b>     Title.  For an article in a book or journal, this should be the title of the article.

       <b>%V</b>     Volume number of the journal or book.

       <b>%X</b>     Annotation.

       For all fields except <b>%A</b> and <b>%E</b>, if there is more than one occurrence of a particular field in a  record,
       only the last such field will be used.

       If  accent  strings  are  used,  they  should follow the character to be accented.  This means that an <u>ms</u>
       document must call the <b>.AM</b> macro when it initializes.  Accent strings should not be  quoted:  use  one  <b>\</b>
       rather  than  two.   Accent  strings  are  an obsolescent feature of the <u>me</u> and <u>ms</u> macro packages; modern
       documents should use <u>groff</u> special character escape sequences instead; see <u><a href="../man7/groff_char.7.html">groff_char</a></u>(7).

   <b>Citations</b>
       Citations have a characteristic format.
              <b>.[</b><u>opening-text</u>
              <u>flags</u> <u>keywords</u>
              <u>fields</u>
              <b>.]</b><u>closing-text</u>

       The <u>opening-text</u>, <u>closing-text</u>, and <u>flags</u> components are optional.  Only one of the <u>keywords</u>  and  <u>fields</u>
       components need be specified.

       The  <u>keywords</u>  component says to search the bibliographic databases for a reference that contains all the
       words in <u>keywords</u>.  It is an error if more than one reference is found.

       The <u>fields</u> components specifies additional fields  to  replace  or  supplement  those  specified  in  the
       reference.   When  references  are  being  accumulated  and  the  <u>keywords</u>  component  is non-empty, then
       additional fields should be specified only on the first occasion that a particular  reference  is  cited,
       and will apply to all citations of that reference.

       The  <u>opening-text</u>  and <u>closing-text</u> components specify strings to be used to bracket the label instead of
       those in the <b>bracket-label</b> command.  If either of these components is non-empty, the strings specified in
       the <b>bracket-label</b> command will not be used; this behavior can  be  altered  using  the  <b>[</b>  and  <b>]</b>  flags.
       Leading and trailing spaces are significant for these components.

       The <u>flags</u> component is a list of non-alphanumeric characters each of which modifies the treatment of this
       particular  citation.   AT&amp;T <u>refer</u> will treat these flags as part of the keywords and so will ignore them
       since they are non-alphanumeric.  The following flags are currently recognized.

       <b>#</b>      Use the label specified by the <b>short-label</b>  command,  instead  of  that  specified  by  the  <b>label</b>
              command.   If  no  short  label  has been specified, the normal label will be used.  Typically the
              short label is used with author-date  labels  and  consists  of  only  the  date  and  possibly  a
              disambiguating letter; the “<b>#</b>” is supposed to be suggestive of a numeric type of label.

       <b>[</b>      Precede <u>opening-text</u> with the first string specified in the <b>bracket-label</b> command.

       <b>]</b>      Follow <u>closing-text</u> with the second string specified in the <b>bracket-label</b> command.

       An  advantage  of using the <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> flags rather than including the brackets in <u>opening-text</u> and <u>closing-</u>
       <u>text</u> is that you can change the style of bracket used in the document just by changing the  <b>bracket-label</b>
       command.  Another is that sorting and merging of citations will not necessarily be inhibited if the flags
       are used.

       If  a  label  is to be inserted into the text, it will be attached to the line preceding the <b>.[</b> line.  If
       there is no such line, then an extra line will be inserted before the <b>.[</b>  line  and  a  warning  will  be
       given.

       There  is  no  special  notation  for  making  a citation to multiple references.  Just use a sequence of
       citations, one for each reference.  Don't put anything between the citations.  The  labels  for  all  the
       citations  will  be  attached to the line preceding the first citation.  The labels may also be sorted or
       merged.   See  the  description  of  the  <b>&lt;&gt;</b>  label  expression,  and  of  the  <b>sort-adjacent-labels</b>  and
       <b>abbreviate-label-ranges</b>  commands.   A  label will not be merged if its citation has a non-empty <u>opening-</u>
       <u>text</u> or <u>closing-text</u>.  However, the labels for a citation using the <b>]</b> flag and without  any  <u>closing-text</u>
       immediately followed by a citation using the <b>[</b> flag and without any <u>opening-text</u> may be sorted and merged
       even  though  the  first citation's <u>opening-text</u> or the second citation's <u>closing-text</u> is non-empty.  (If
       you wish to prevent this, use the dummy character escape sequence <b>\&amp;</b> as  the  first  citation's  <u>closing-</u>
       <u>text</u>.)

   <b>Commands</b>
       Commands  are  contained  between  lines  starting  with  <b>.R1</b> and <b>.R2</b>.  Recognition of these lines can be
       prevented by the <b>-R</b> option.  When a <b>.R1</b> line is recognized any accumulated references  are  flushed  out.
       Neither <b>.R1</b> nor <b>.R2</b> lines, nor anything between them, is output.

       Commands are separated by newlines or semicolons.  A number sign (<b>#</b>) introduces a comment that extends to
       the  end of the line, but does not conceal the newline.  Each command is broken up into words.  Words are
       separated by spaces or tabs.  A word that begins with a (neutral) double quote (<b>"</b>) extends  to  the  next
       double  quote  that  is not followed by another double quote.  If there is no such double quote, the word
       extends to the end of the line.  Pairs of double quotes in a word beginning with a double quote  collapse
       to  one  double quote.  Neither a number sign nor a semicolon is recognized inside double quotes.  A line
       can be continued by ending it with a backslash “<b>\</b>”; this works everywhere except after a number sign.

       Each command <u>name</u> that is marked with * has an associated negative command <b>no-</b><u>name</u> that undoes the effect
       of <u>name</u>.  For example, the <b>no-sort</b> command specifies that references should not be sorted.  The  negative
       commands take no arguments.

       In  the  following  description  each argument must be a single word; <u>field</u> is used for a single upper or
       lower case letter naming a field; <u>fields</u> is used for a sequence of such letters; <u>m</u> and <u>n</u> are used  for  a
       non-negative numbers; <u>string</u> is used for an arbitrary string; <u>file</u> is used for the name of a file.

       <b>abbreviate</b>* <u>fields</u> <u>string1</u> <u>string2</u> <u>string3</u> <u>string4</u>
              Abbreviate  the  first  names of <u>fields</u>.  An initial letter will be separated from another initial
              letter by <u>string1</u>, from the last name by <u>string2</u>, and from anything else (such as “von”  or  “de”)
              by  <u>string3</u>.   These  default  to  a  period followed by a space.  In a hyphenated first name, the
              initial of the first part of the name will be separated from the hyphen by <u>string4</u>; this  defaults
              to  a  period.   No attempt is made to handle any ambiguities that might result from abbreviation.
              Names are abbreviated before sorting and before label construction.

       <b>abbreviate-label-ranges</b>* <u>string</u>
              Three or more adjacent labels that refer to consecutive references will be abbreviated to a  label
              consisting  of  the  first  label, followed by <u>string</u>, followed by the last label.  This is mainly
              useful with numeric labels.  If <u>string</u> is omitted, it defaults to “<b>-</b>”.

       <b>accumulate</b>*
              Accumulate references instead of writing out each reference as  it  is  encountered.   Accumulated
              references will be written out whenever a reference of the form
                     <b>.[</b>
                     <b>$LIST$</b>
                     <b>.]</b>
              is encountered, after all input files have been processed, and whenever a <b>.R1</b> line is recognized.

       <b>annotate</b>* <u>field</u> <u>string</u>
              <u>field</u> is an annotation; print it at the end of the reference as a paragraph preceded by the line

                     <b>.</b><u>string</u>

              If  <u>string</u> is omitted, it will default to <b>AP</b>; if <u>field</u> is also omitted it will default to <b>X</b>.  Only
              one field can be an annotation.

       <b>articles</b> <u>string</u> ...
              Each <u>string</u> is a definite or indefinite article, and should be  ignored  at  the  beginning  of  <b>T</b>
              fields when sorting.  Initially, “a”, “an”, and “the” are recognized as articles.

       <b>bibliography</b> <u>file</u> ...
              Write  out  all the references contained in each bibliographic database <u>file</u>.  This command should
              come last in an <b>.R1</b>/<b>.R2</b> block.

       <b>bracket-label</b> <u>string1</u> <u>string2</u> <u>string3</u>
              In the text, bracket each label with <u>string1</u> and <u>string2</u>.  An occurrence  of  <u>string2</u>  immediately
              followed by <u>string1</u> will be turned into <u>string3</u>.  The default behavior is as follows.
                     <b>bracket-label</b> <b>\*([.</b> <b>\*(.]</b> <b>",</b> <b>"</b>

       <b>capitalize</b> <u>fields</u>
              Convert <u>fields</u> to caps and small caps.

       <b>compatible</b>*
              Recognize <b>.R1</b> and <b>.R2</b> even when followed by a character other than space or newline.

       <b>database</b> <u>file</u> ...
              Search  each bibliographic database <u>file</u>.  For each <u>file</u>, if an index file<u>.i</u> created by <u><a href="../man1/indxbib.1.html">indxbib</a></u>(1)
              exists, then it will be searched instead; each index can cover multiple databases.

       <b>date-as-label</b>* <u>string</u>
              <u>string</u> is a label expression that specifies a string with which  to  replace  the  <b>D</b>  field  after
              constructing  the  label.   See  subsection  “Label  expressions” below for a description of label
              expressions.  This command is useful if you do not want explicit labels in the reference list, but
              instead want to handle any necessary disambiguation by qualifying the date in some way.  The label
              used in the text would typically be some combination of the author and date.  In  most  cases  you
              should also use the <b>no-label-in-reference</b> command.  For example,
                     <b>date-as-label</b> <b>D.+yD.y%a*D.-y</b>
              would attach a disambiguating letter to the year part of the <b>D</b> field in the reference.

       <b>default-database</b>*
              The default database should be searched.  This is the default behavior, so the negative version of
              this  command is more useful.  <u>refer</u> determines whether the default database should be searched on
              the first occasion that it needs to do a search.  Thus a <b>no-default-database</b> command must be given
              before then, in order to be effective.

       <b>discard</b>* <u>fields</u>
              When the reference is read, <u>fields</u> should be discarded; no string definitions for <u>fields</u>  will  be
              output.  Initially, <u>fields</u> are <b>XYZ</b>.

       <b>et-al</b>* <u>string</u> <u>m</u> <u>n</u>
              Control  use  of <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> in the evaluation of <b>@</b> expressions in label expressions.  If the number of
              authors needed to make the author sequence unambiguous is <u>u</u> and the total number of authors  is  <u>t</u>
              then the last <u>t</u>-<u>u</u> authors will be replaced by <u>string</u> provided that <u>t</u>-<u>u</u> is not less than <u>m</u> and <u>t</u> is
              not less than <u>n</u>.  The default behavior is as follows.
                     <b>et-al</b> <b>"</b> <b>et</b> <b>al"</b> <b>2</b> <b>3</b>
              Note  the  absence  of a dot from the end of the abbreviation, which is arguably not correct.  (<u>Et</u>
              <u>al</u>[.]  is short for <u>et</u> <u>alli</u>, as <u>etc.</u> is short for <u>et</u> <u>cetera</u>.)

       <b>include</b> <u>file</u>
              Include <u>file</u> and interpret the contents as commands.

       <b>join-authors</b> <u>string1</u> <u>string2</u> <u>string3</u>
              Join multiple authors together with <u>string</u>s.  When there are exactly two  authors,  they  will  be
              joined  with  <u>string1</u>.   When there are more than two authors, all but the last two will be joined
              with <u>string2</u>, and the last two authors will be joined with <u>string3</u>.  If  <u>string3</u>  is  omitted,  it
              will default to <u>string1</u>; if <u>string2</u> is also omitted it will also default to <u>string1</u>.  For example,
                     join-authors " and " ", " ", and "
              will restore the default method for joining authors.

       <b>label-in-reference</b>*
              When  outputting  the  reference,  define  the string <b>[F</b> to be the reference's label.  This is the
              default behavior, so the negative version of this command is more useful.

       <b>label-in-text</b>*
              For each reference output a label in the text.  The label will be separated from  the  surrounding
              text  as  described  in  the <b>bracket-label</b> command.  This is the default behavior, so the negative
              version of this command is more useful.

       <b>label</b> <u>string</u>
              <u>string</u> is a label expression describing how to label each reference.

       <b>separate-label-second-parts</b> <u>string</u>
              When merging two-part labels, separate the second part of the second label from  the  first  label
              with <u>string</u>.  See the description of the <b>&lt;&gt;</b> label expression.

       <b>move-punctuation</b>*
              In the text, move any punctuation at the end of line past the label.  It is usually a good idea to
              give this command unless you are using superscripted numbers as labels.

       <b>reverse</b>* <u>string</u>
              Reverse  the  fields whose names are in <u>string</u>.  Each field name can be followed by a number which
              says how many such fields should be reversed.  If no number is given for a field, all such  fields
              will be reversed.

       <b>search-ignore</b>* <u>fields</u>
              While  searching  for  keys in databases for which no index exists, ignore the contents of <u>fields</u>.
              Initially, fields <b>XYZ</b> are ignored.

       <b>search-truncate</b>* <u>n</u>
              Only require the first <u>n</u> characters of keys to be given.  In effect when searching for a given key
              words in the database are truncated to the maximum of <u>n</u> and the length of the key.   Initially,  <u>n</u>
              is 6.

       <b>short-label</b>* <u>string</u>
              <u>string</u> is a label expression that specifies an alternative (usually shorter) style of label.  This
              is  used  when  the  <b>#</b>  flag  is  given in the citation.  When using author-date style labels, the
              identity of the author or authors is sometimes clear from the context, and so it may be  desirable
              to  omit  the author or authors from the label.  The <b>short-label</b> command will typically be used to
              specify a label containing just a date and possibly a disambiguating letter.

       <b>sort</b>* <u>string</u>
              Sort references according to <u>string</u>.  References will automatically be accumulated.  <u>string</u> should
              be a list of field names, each followed by a number, indicating how  many  fields  with  the  name
              should  be used for sorting.  “<b>+</b>” can be used to indicate that all the fields with the name should
              be used.  Also <b>.</b> can be used to indicate the references should be  sorted  using  the  (tentative)
              label.  (Subsection “Label expressions” below describes the concept of a tentative label.)

       <b>sort-adjacent-labels</b>*
              Sort labels that are adjacent in the text according to their position in the reference list.  This
              command  should  usually be given if the <b>abbreviate-label-ranges</b> command has been given, or if the
              label expression contains a <b>&lt;&gt;</b> expression.  This will have no effect unless references  are  being
              accumulated.

   <b>Label</b> <b>expressions</b>
       Label  expressions  can  be  evaluated both normally and tentatively.  The result of normal evaluation is
       used for output.  The result of tentative evaluation, called the <u>tentative</u> <u>label</u>, is used to  gather  the
       information  that  normal evaluation needs to disambiguate the label.  Label expressions specified by the
       <b>date-as-label</b> and <b>short-label</b> commands are not evaluated tentatively.  Normal  and  tentative  evaluation
       are  the  same  for  all  types  of expression other than <b>@</b>, <b>*</b>, and <b>%</b> expressions.  The description below
       applies to normal evaluation, except where otherwise specified.

       <u>field</u>
       <u>field</u> <u>n</u>
              The <u>n</u>-th part of <u>field</u>.  If <u>n</u> is omitted, it defaults to 1.

       <b>'</b><u>string</u><b>'</b>
              The characters in <u>string</u> literally.

       <b>@</b>      All the authors joined as specified by the <b>join-authors</b> command.  The whole of each author's  name
              will  be  used.   However, if the references are sorted by author (that is, the sort specification
              starts with “<b>A+</b>”), then authors' last names will be used instead,  provided  that  this  does  not
              introduce ambiguity, and also an initial subsequence of the authors may be used instead of all the
              authors, again provided that this does not introduce ambiguity.  The use of only the last name for
              the  <u>i</u>-th author of some reference is considered to be ambiguous if there is some other reference,
              such that the first <u>i</u>-1 authors of the references are the same, the <u>i</u>-th authors are not the same,
              but the <u>i</u>-th authors last names are the same.  A proper initial subsequence  of  the  sequence  of
              authors  for  some reference is considered to be ambiguous if there is a reference with some other
              sequence of authors which also has that subsequence as a  proper  initial  subsequence.   When  an
              initial subsequence of authors is used, the remaining authors are replaced by the string specified
              by  the  <b>et-al</b>  command;  this  command  may also specify additional requirements that must be met
              before an initial subsequence can be used.  <b>@</b> tentatively evaluates to a canonical  representation
              of  the  authors,  such  that  authors that compare equally for sorting purpose will have the same
              representation.

       <b>%</b><u>n</u>
       <b>%a</b>
       <b>%A</b>
       <b>%i</b>
       <b>%I</b>     The serial number of the reference formatted according to the  character  following  the  <b>%</b>.   The
              serial  number of a reference is 1 plus the number of earlier references with same tentative label
              as this reference.  These expressions tentatively evaluate to an empty string.

       <u>expr</u><b>*</b>  If there is another reference with  the  same  tentative  label  as  this  reference,  then  <u>expr</u>,
              otherwise an empty string.  It tentatively evaluates to an empty string.

       <u>expr</u><b>+</b><u>n</u>
       <u>expr</u><b>-</b><u>n</u> The  first  (<b>+</b>)  or  last  (<b>-</b>)  <u>n</u>  upper  or  lower  case letters or digits of <u>expr</u>.  <u>roff</u> special
              characters (such as <b>\('a</b>) count as a single letter.  Accent strings are retained but do not  count
              towards the total.

       <u>expr</u><b>.l</b> <u>expr</u> converted to lowercase.

       <u>expr</u><b>.u</b> <u>expr</u> converted to uppercase.

       <u>expr</u><b>.c</b> <u>expr</u> converted to caps and small caps.

       <u>expr</u><b>.r</b> <u>expr</u> reversed so that the last name is first.

       <u>expr</u><b>.a</b> <u>expr</u>  with  first  names  abbreviated.  Fields specified in the <b>abbreviate</b> command are abbreviated
              before any labels are evaluated.  Thus <b>.a</b> is useful only when you want a field to  be  abbreviated
              in a label but not in a reference.

       <u>expr</u><b>.y</b> The year part of <u>expr</u>.

       <u>expr</u><b>.+y</b>
              The part of <u>expr</u> before the year, or the whole of <u>expr</u> if it does not contain a year.

       <u>expr</u><b>.-y</b>
              The part of <u>expr</u> after the year, or an empty string if <u>expr</u> does not contain a year.

       <u>expr</u><b>.n</b> The last name part of <u>expr</u>.

       <u>expr1</u><b>~</b><u>expr2</u>
              <u>expr1</u> except that if the last character of <u>expr1</u> is <b>-</b> then it will be replaced by <u>expr2</u>.

       <u>expr1</u> <u>expr2</u>
              The concatenation of <u>expr1</u> and <u>expr2</u>.

       <u>expr1</u><b>|</b><u>expr2</u>
              If <u>expr1</u> is non-empty then <u>expr1</u> otherwise <u>expr2</u>.

       <u>expr1</u><b>&amp;</b><u>expr2</u>
              If <u>expr1</u> is non-empty then <u>expr2</u> otherwise an empty string.

       <u>expr1</u><b>?</b><u>expr2</u><b>:</b><u>expr3</u>
              If <u>expr1</u> is non-empty then <u>expr2</u> otherwise <u>expr3</u>.

       <b>&lt;</b><u>expr</u><b>&gt;</b> The  label  is in two parts, which are separated by <u>expr</u>.  Two adjacent two-part labels which have
              the same first part will be merged by appending the second part of the second label onto the first
              label separated by the string specified in the <b>separate-label-second-parts</b> command  (initially,  a
              comma  followed by a space); the resulting label will also be a two-part label with the same first
              part as before merging, and so additional labels can be merged into it.  It is permissible for the
              first part to be empty; this may be desirable for expressions used in the <b>short-label</b> command.

       <b>(</b><u>expr</u><b>)</b> The same as <u>expr</u>.  Used for grouping.

       The above expressions are listed in  order  of  precedence  (highest  first);  <b>&amp;</b>  and  <b>|</b>  have  the  same
       precedence.

   <b>Macro</b> <b>interface</b>
       Each  reference  starts  with  a call to the macro <b>]-</b>.  The string <b>[F</b> will be defined to be the label for
       this reference, unless the <b>no-label-in-reference</b> command has been given.  There then follows a series  of
       string definitions, one for each field: string <b>[</b><u>X</u> corresponds to field <u>X</u>.  The register <b>[P</b> is set to 1 if
       the  <b>P</b>  field  contains a range of pages.  The <b>[T</b>, <b>[A</b> and <b>[O</b> registers are set to 1 according as the <b>T</b>, <b>A</b>
       and <b>O</b> fields end with any of <b>.?!</b> (an end-of-sentence character).  The <b>[E</b> register will be set to 1 if the
       <b>[E</b> string contains more than one name.  The reference is followed by a call to the <b>][</b> macro.   The  first
       argument  to this macro gives a number representing the type of the reference.  If a reference contains a
       <b>J</b> field, it will be classified as type 1, otherwise if it  contains  a  <b>B</b>  field,  it  will  be  type  3,
       otherwise if it contains a <b>G</b> or <b>R</b> field it will be type 4, otherwise if it contains an <b>I</b> field it will be
       type  2,  otherwise  it  will  be  type  0.   The second argument is a symbolic name for the type: <b>other</b>,
       <b>journal-article</b>, <b>book</b>, <b>article-in-book</b>, or <b>tech-report</b>.  Groups of references that have been  accumulated
       or are produced by the <b>bibliography</b> command are preceded by a call to the <b>]&lt;</b> macro and followed by a call
       to the <b>]&gt;</b> macro.

       The foregoing shows us that <u>refer</u> (a) produces a label “1”; (b) brackets that label  with  interpolations
       of  the “<b>[.</b>”  and “<b>.]</b>”  strings; (c) calls a macro “<b>]-</b>”; (d) defines strings and registers containing the
       label and bibliographic data for the reference; (e) calls a macro “<b>][</b>”; and (f) uses the  <b>lf</b>  request  to
       restore  the  line numbers of the original input.  As discussed in subsection “Macro interface” above, it
       is up to the document or a macro package to employ and format this information usefully.  Let us see  how
       we might turn <u><a href="../man7/groff_ms.7.html">groff_ms</a></u>(7) to this task.
