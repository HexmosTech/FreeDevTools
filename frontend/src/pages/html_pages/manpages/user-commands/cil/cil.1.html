</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Cil is a small but useful command-line issue list. It saves issues, comments and attachments as local
       files which you can check in to your repository.

       init [--path=PATH] [--bare]
           Creates  a  local  '.cil'  file  and an 'issues' directory. If PATH is specified, the config file and
           directory will be created in the destination directory.

           Usually, cil will write a small ".cil" file such that you can use various filter commands immediately
           and can also serve as an example config file. Using "--bare" just  touches  the  ".cil"  config  file
           ready for your own manipulation.

       summary [filters]
           Displays a one line summary for each issue. You may filter on both the Status and Label fields.

       list [filters]
           Shows each issue with more information. You may filter on both the Status and Label fields.

       add [--mine] [summary]
           Adds  an  issues  after  you  have edited the input.  Text passed after 'add' will be used as the bug
           summary line.

           If you use the --mine flag, the AssignedTo field is automatically set to you (saves  having  to  copy
           and paste the CreatedBy field).

       show ISSUE
           Shows the issue name with more detail.

       status ISSUE NEW_STATUS
           Shortcut so that you can set a new status on an issue without having to edit it.

       depends-on ISSUE1 ISSUE2
           Shortcut  so  that  cil will add a 'DependsOn' from issue 1 to issue 2. Conversley, issue 2 will also
           then contain a 'Precedes' pointer to issue 1.

       precedes ISSUE1 ISSUE2
           This is the exact opposite of "depends-on" and is here for convenience and completeness. ie. issue  1
           has to be completed before issue 2.

       status ISSUE NEW_STATUS
           Shortcut so that you can set a new status on an issue without having to edit it.

       steal ISSUE
           Shortcut  to  assign  this  issue  to  yourself.  It reads your "<a href="file:~/.cilrc">~/.cilrc</a>" file for your UserName and
           UserEmail and uses this to populate the "AssignedTo" field in the issue.

       edit ISSUE
           Edits the issue. If it changes, set the updates time to now.

       comment ISSUE
           Adds a comment to an issues after you have edited the input.

       attach ISSUE FILENAME
           Adds that particular filename to an existing issue.

       extract ATTACHMENT [--filename=FILENAME]
           Extracts the file from the attachment number. If filename if given uses that, otherwise it  will  use
           the original one saved along with the attachment.

       am  Applies  an  email message to the issue list. It tries to figure out the type of email it is, whether
           it is a new issue or a comment on an already existing issue. For example, if it can find valid  issue
           names  in the subject or body of the message, it adds it as a comment to that issue. If it can't find
           any valid issue names, it presumes it's a new issue and adds that.

           Note: this command will deal with Mailbox format files later on.

       track ISSUE
           This command outputs one or more command which you should run so  that  your  VCS  knows  about  your
           issue. It makes sure all the comments and attachments are done too.

       fsck
           Tries to help you organise your issues if any aren't valid or have broken relationships.

</pre><h4><b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       Filters  can be used on both the "summary" and "list" commands. Most can be combined. See each individual
       filter for details.

       --status=STATUS
           You can choose any of the Statuses which might appear in your issues. This status does not have to be
           defined in your ".cil" file, even if you have "StatusStrict" turned on.

       --label=LABEL
           You can choose any of the Labels which might appear in your issues. This label does not  have  to  be
           defined in your ".cil" file, even if you have "LabelStrict" turned on.

       --is-open, --is-closed
           These  check  both  "StatusOpenList"  and  "StatusClosedList"  from  your  ".cil"  file.  If both are
           specified, you're likely to get no issues unless you explicitly defined a status  as  being  in  both
           lists (for whatever reason you have).

       --assigned-to=EMAIL_ADDRESS, --is-mine
           These  items  are  mutually  exclusive.  The  "--assigned-to"  just  checks  the email address in the
           AssignedTo field. It does not match anything else in that field, including any preceding name or  any
           angle brackets.

           The  "--is-mine" filter is a shortcut to asking if AssignedTo is you. Cil knows your email address if
           you define it in your user's "<a href="file:~/.cilrc">~/.cilrc</a>" file as "UserEmail".

</pre><h4><b>.cil</b></h4><pre>
       The ".cil" file is used to configure bits and pieces within cil  for  this  particular  issue  list.  The
       following options are available and where stated, may be declared multiple times:

       The ".cil" file is fairly simple and an example can be seen here:

           UseGit: 1
           StatusStrict: 1
           StatusOpenList: New
           StatusOpenList: InProgress
           StatusClosedList: Finished
           LabelStrict: 1
           LabelAllowedList: Type-Enhancement
           LabelAllowedList: Type-Defect
           LabelAllowedList: Priority-High
           LabelAllowedList: Priority-Medium
           LabelAllowedList: Priority-Low

       UseGit
           Default: 0, Type: Boolean (0/1)

           Determines  whether  to  use  Git  or  not.  Some features require Git though Cil is perfectly usable
           without.

       StatusStrict
           Default: 0, Type: Boolean (0/1)

           If this is set to a true value then cil checks that the status you enter into an issue (after  adding
           or editing) is also in the allowed list (see StatusAllowedList).

       StatusOpenList
           Default: empty, Type: List

           This list is checked against when filtering with --is-open.

       StatusClosedList
           Default: empty, Type: List

           This list is checked against when filtering with --is-closed.

       StatusAllowedList
           This  list  is  automatically generated from the StatusOpenList and the StatusClosedList. It does not
           have to appear in the config file.

       LabelStrict
           Default: 0, Type: Boolean (0/1)

           This determines that labels you enter are checked against LabelAllowedList. Set to 1 if  you  require
           this feature.

       LabelAllowedList
           Default: empty, Type: List

           This determines which labels are allowed if you have turned on LabelStrict.

</pre><h4><b><a href="file:~/.cilrc">~/.cilrc</a></b></h4><pre>
       The "<a href="file:~/.cilrc">~/.cilrc</a>" file is read to configure the user's preferences for all cil lists they're using. It is of
       the same format as the ".cil" file and contains the following options:

           UserName: Andrew Chilton
           UserEmail: <a href="mailto:andychilton@gmail.com">andychilton@gmail.com</a>

       UserName
           Default: 'Name', Type: String

           This   is   used   as   a   default   in   the   "CreatedBy"   and   "AssignedTo"   fields   in   any
           issues/comments/attachments you add.

       UserEmail
           Default: 'Email', Type: String

           This   is   used   as   a   default   in   the   "CreatedBy"   and   "AssignedTo"   fields   in   any
           issues/comments/attachments you add.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Probably. Let me know :-)

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       To get a ToDo list for cil, clone the repo, find the issues/ dir and type:

           $ cil --is-open

       This gives the current outstanding issues in cil.
