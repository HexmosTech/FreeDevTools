</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       break — exit from for, while, or until loop

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       break <b>[</b><u>n</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If <u>n</u> is specified, the <u>break</u> utility shall exit from the <u>n</u>th enclosing <b>for</b>, <b>while</b>, or <b>until</b> loop. If <u>n</u> is
       not  specified,  <u>break</u> shall behave as if <u>n</u> was specified as 1. Execution shall continue with the command
       immediately following the exited loop. The value of <u>n</u> is a positive decimal integer. If <u>n</u> is greater than
       the number of enclosing loops, the outermost enclosing loop shall be exited. If  there  is  no  enclosing
       loop, the behavior is unspecified.

       A  loop  shall  enclose  a  <u>break</u>  or <u>continue</u> command if the loop lexically encloses the command. A loop
       lexically encloses a <u>break</u> or <u>continue</u> command if the command is:

        *  Executing in the same execution environment (see <u>Section</u> <u>2.12</u>, <u>Shell</u> <u>Execution</u>  <u>Environment</u>)  as  the
           compound-list of the loop's do-group (see <u>Section</u> <u>2.10.2</u>, <u>Shell</u> <u>Grammar</u> <u>Rules</u>), and

        *  Contained  in a compound-list associated with the loop (either in the compound-list of the loop's do-
           group or, if the loop is a <b>while</b> or <b>until</b> loop, in the compound-list following  the  <b>while</b>  or  <b>until</b>
           reserved word), and

        *  Not  in  the  body  of  a  function  whose  function  definition command (see <u>Section</u> <u>2.9.5</u>, <u>Function</u>
           <u>Definition</u> <u>Command</u>) is contained in a compound-list associated with the loop.

       If <u>n</u> is greater than the number of lexically enclosing loops and there is a non-lexically enclosing  loop
       in progress in the same execution environment as the <u>break</u> or <u>continue</u> command, it is unspecified whether
       that loop encloses the command.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       See the DESCRIPTION.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    The <u>n</u> value was not an unsigned decimal integer greater than or equal to 1.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       for i in *
       do
           if test -d "$i"
           then break
           fi
       done

       The  results  of  running the following example are unspecified: there are two loops in progress when the
       <u>break</u> command is executed, and they are in the same execution environment, but neither loop is  lexically
       enclosing the <u>break</u> command. (There are no loops lexically enclosing the <u>continue</u> commands, either.)

       foo() {
           for j in 1 2; do
               echo 'break 2' &gt;/tmp/do_break
               echo "  sourcing /tmp/do_break ($j)..."
               # the behavior of the break from running the following command
               # results in unspecified behavior:
               . /tmp/do_break

               do_continue() { continue 2; }
               echo "  running do_continue ($j)..."
               # the behavior of the continue in the following function call
               # results in unspecified behavior (if execution reaches this
               # point):
               do_continue

               trap 'continue 2' USR1
               echo "  sending SIGUSR1 to self ($j)..."
               # the behavior of the continue in the trap invoked from the
               # following signal results in unspecified behavior (if
               # execution reaches this point):
               kill -s USR1 $$
               sleep 1
           done
       }
       for i in 1 2; do
           echo "running foo ($i)..."
           foo
       done

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       In  early  proposals, consideration was given to expanding the syntax of <u>break</u> and <u>continue</u> to refer to a
       label associated with the appropriate loop as a preferable alternative to the  <u>n</u>  method.  However,  this
       volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017  does  reserve  the  name  space  of command names ending with a &lt;colon&gt;.  It is
       anticipated that a future implementation could take advantage of this and provide something like:

           outofloop: for i in a b c d e
           do
               for j in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
               do
                   if test -r "${i}${j}"
                   then break outofloop
                   fi
               done
           done

       and that this might be standardized after implementation experience is achieved.
