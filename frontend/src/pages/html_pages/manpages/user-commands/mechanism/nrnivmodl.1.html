</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nrnivmodl - Compile special version of NEURON with custom mechanisms

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nrnivmodl</b> [<b>FILES</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents the <b>nrnivmodl</b> command.

       <b>nrnivmodl</b> is part of the NEURON simulation environment for computational models of physiological neurons.
       Its purpose is to compile membrane mechanisms with user-defined properties.

       If .mod files are supplied as <u>FILES</u> <b>nrnivmodl</b> will compile them into a dedicated version of NEURON called
       <u>special</u>  with the new mechanisms included.  The new NEURON version is put into a subdirectory named after
       the current CPU architecture.

       If no file arguments are present, <b>nrnivmodl</b> adds all the files in the current working directory that have
       the suffix .mod to <u>special</u>.  In order to construct an executable, the model descriptions first have to be
       translated into C code, which is then compiled using the default C compiler.

       Such models must contain a NEURON block which specifies the type of model  (density  mechanism  or  point
       process),  the  names  of  ions  it uses, and which variables are to be treated as range variables in the
       interface to OC.
