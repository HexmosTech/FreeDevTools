</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pal - calendar with events

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pal</b> <u>[options]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pal</b>  is a command‐line calendar utility.  It displays a <b><a href="../man1/cal.1.html">cal</a>(1)</b>‐like calendar and events specified in text
       files.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are provided by <b>pal</b>:

       <b>-d</b> <u>date</u>
              Show events on the given date.  Valid formats for <u>date</u> include: dd, mmdd,  yyyymmdd,  'yesterday',
              'today',  'tomorrow',  'n days away', 'n days ago', first two letters of weekday, 'next ' followed
              by first two letters of weekday, 'last ' followed by first two letters of weekday, '1  Jan  2000',
              'Jan 1 2000'.

       <b>-r</b> <u>n</u>   Display  events  occurring  in the next <u>n</u> days (counting today).  By default, <u>n</u> is 0 and no events
              are displayed.  For example, using <u>-r</u> <u>1</u> makes <b>pal</b> display events occurring today.  If <b>-d</b>  is  used
              too, the range is relative to <u>date</u> instead of the current date.

       <b>-r</b> <u>p</u><b>-</b><u>n</u> Display  a  list  of  events occurring in the past <u>p</u> days (not counting today) and the next <u>n</u> days
              (counting today).  For example <u>-r</u> <u>1-1</u> will show yesterday's and today's events.   If  <b>-d</b>  is  used
              too, the range is relative to <u>date</u> instead of the current date.

       <b>-s</b> <u>regex</u>
              Search  for  any  occurrences of an event matching the regular expression (<u>regex</u>) occurring in the
              range of dates specified with <b>-r</b>.  This command searches both the event description and  the  type
              of event (specified at the top of a calendar file).  This search is case insensitive.

       <b>-x</b> <u>n</u>   Expunge events that are <u>n</u> or more days old if they do not occur again in the future.  <b>pal</b> will not
              expunge  events  from  the calendars loaded from <u>/usr/share/pal</u>; even if you are root and you have
              added events to the calendars that are not recurring.  When <b>-x</b> is used with <b>-v</b>,  the  events  that
              are expunged will be displayed.

       <b>-c</b> <u>n</u>   Display a calendar with <u>n</u> lines (default: 5).

       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>
              Load <u>file</u> instead of <u><a href="file:~/.pal/pal.conf">~/.pal/pal.conf</a></u>.

       <b>-u</b> <u>username</u>
              Load <a href="file:/home/">/home/</a><u>username</u>/.pal/pal.conf instead of <u><a href="file:~/.pal/pal.conf">~/.pal/pal.conf</a></u>.

       <b>-p</b> <u>palfile</u>
              Override  the  .pal files loaded from pal.conf.  This will only load <u>palfile</u>.  For convenience, if
              <u>palfile</u> is a relative path, pal looks for the file relative from <u><a href="file:~/.pal/">~/.pal/</a></u>, if not found,  it  tries
              relative  to  <u>/usr/share/pal/</u>,  if  not  found it tries relative to your current directory.  (This
              behavior might change in the future.)  Using an absolute path will work as you expect it to.

       <b>-m</b>     Manage events interactively.  Events can be added, modified and deleted with this interface.

       <b>--color</b>
              Force use of colors, regardless of terminal type.

       <b>--nocolor</b>
              Do not use colors, regardless of terminal type.

       <b>--mail</b> Generates output readable by  sendmail  by  adding  "From:"  and  "Subject:"  fields  and  forcing
              <b>--nocolor</b>.   For  example,  you  could mail yourself a reminder of the upcoming events in the next
              week with <b>pal</b> <b>--mail</b> <b>-r</b> <b>7</b> <b>|</b> <b>sendmail</b> <b>username</b>.  Note: For the calendar to appear  correctly,  make
              sure your email client is using a fixed width font.

       <b>--html</b> Generates  a  HTML  calendar  suitable for display on a web page.  It does not generate a complete
              HTML document so that you can add your website's header  and  footer  around  the  calendar.   The
              number  of  months  shown on the calendar can be adjusted with <b>-c</b>.  You will need to use Cascading
              Style Sheets (CSS) to change how the calendar appears; if you  do  not  use  a  style  sheet,  the
              calendar  will  not  have any borders.  See <u>/usr/share/doc/pal/examples/example.css</u> for an example
              style.  SECURITY NOTE: If you set up pal so it is being executed server‐side,  it  is  recommended
              that  you  do not allow web page visitors to directly change the parameters sent to pal.  Allowing
              users to pass strange parameters (such as extremely long ones) can be a security risk.

       <b>--latex</b>
              Generates a LaTeX source for a calendar that can be used to generate a printer‐friendly  DVI  (run
              "pal  --latex  &gt;  file.tex;  latex  file.tex"),  PostScript  or  PDF (run "pal --latex &gt; file.tex;
              pdflatex file.tex").  The number of months shown on the calendar can be adjusted with <b>-c</b>.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose output.

       <b>--version</b>
              Display version information.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display a help message.

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>DESCRIPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Years</b> <b>since</b> <b>year</b> <b>YYYY</b>
          pal will replace !YYYY! (where YYYY is a year) with the current year  minus  YYYY.   This  feature  is
          particularly  useful for birthdays.  For example, the event text for a birthday could be: John Doe was
          born on this day in 1990.  He is !1990! years old.

       <b>Sort</b> <b>by</b> <b>time</b>
          If events have a time in the event description, pal will sort these events by time.  The time  in  the
          event  description  must be of the format <u>h:mm</u> or <u>hh:mm</u> (where <u>hh</u> is 0-23).  If an event has more than
          one time in the event description, pal will sort the event by the first time.  Events that do not have
          times in them are shown before all the events that do have times.  Events without times are sorted  in
          the order that they are loaded in pal.conf.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       Unless  <b>-f</b>  or  <b>-u</b>  is  used, <b>pal</b> looks for (or tries to create if it doesn't exist) a configuration file
       named <u><a href="file:~/.pal/pal.conf">~/.pal/pal.conf</a></u>.  <b>pal.conf</b> contains settings for <b>pal</b> and a list other files that contain events  to
       be displayed on the calendar.  The file formats for <b>pal.conf</b> and the <b>event</b> <b>files</b> are described below.

       <b>pal.conf</b>

          <b>file</b> <u>filename</u> [ <u>(color)</u> ]
                 Loads an <b>event</b> <b>file</b> named <u>filename</u>.  If <u>filename</u> isn't found in <u><a href="file:~/.pal">~/.pal</a></u>, <b>pal</b> will look for it in
                 <u>/usr/share/pal</u>.   The  color parameter is optional, it will display the events in the file with
                 the given color.  Valid colors: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white

          <b>file_hide</b> <u>filename</u> [ <u>(color)</u> ]
                 Loads an <b>event</b> <b>file</b> name <u>filename</u>.  These events are not indicated  in  the  calendar  that  is
                 printed,  but  they  are  displayed  when  the <u>-r</u> argument is used.  If <u>filename</u> isn't found in
                 <u><a href="file:~/.pal">~/.pal</a></u>, <b>pal</b> will look for it in <u>/usr/share/pal</u>.  The  color  parameter  is  optional,  it  will
                 display  the events in the file with the given color.  Valid colors: black, red, green, yellow,
                 blue, magenta, cyan, white

          <b>event_color</b> <u>color</u>
                 The default color used for events.  Valid colors: black, red,  green,  yellow,  blue,  magenta,
                 cyan, white

          <b>week_start_monday</b>
                 If this keyword is defined, the calendar weeks start on Monday instead of Sunday.

          <b>date_fmt</b> <u>string</u>
                 Changes  how dates are displayed when the <b>-r</b> <b>-d</b> or <b>-s</b> arguments are used.  <u>string</u> can be a date
                 format string that follows the  format  used  by  <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3)</b>.   Type  <b>man</b>  <b>strftime</b>  for  more
                 information.  <u>string</u> is set to <b>%a</b> <b>%e</b> <b>%b</b> <b>%Y</b> by default (example: Sun  8 Aug 2010).

          <b>reverse_order</b>
                 Display all event listings in descending order.

          <b>hide_event_type</b>
                 Hide  the event type (shown in before a ':') when listing events.  The event type is defined at
                 the top of the file that the event is found in.

          <b>cal_on_bottom</b>
                 Display calendar at the end of the output.

          <b>no_columns</b>
                 Display calendar in one column instead of two.

          <b>compact_list</b>
                 List events that are shown when using -r in a more compact form.

          <b>compact_date_fmt</b>
                 Format for the date displayed when compact_list is used.  See date_fmt for more information.

          <b>default_range</b> <u>range</u>
                 If you get tired of always using -r, you can set the  default  value  for  -r  here.   See  the
                 information on -r above to see possible values for <u>range</u>.  Note: Remember that this will affect
                 what is displayed when -d and -s are used too.

       <b>Event</b> <b>Files</b>
          Event  files  are ASCII or UTF-8 text files (usually with a .pal ending) that define events for <b>pal</b> to
          show.  Example event files can be found in <u>/usr/share/pal</u>.  The first line  in  these  files  indicate
          settings  that apply to all of the events in the file.  The first line starts with two characters that
          should be used in the calendar that <b>pal</b> displays.  A longer description of the kinds of events in  the
          file  follows  the  two  characters.  This description will be displayed when the <b>-r</b> argument is used.
          All other lines in the file are in the format <u>date</u> <u>event</u>.  <u>date</u> defines  when  the  event  occurs  and
          <u>event</u>  is a string that describes the event.  Below is a description of the different strings that can
          be used with <u>date</u>:

          <b>Events</b> <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>only</b> <b>once</b>
                 Use the format <u>yyyymmdd</u>.

          <b>Daily</b> <b>events</b>
                 The format <u>DAILY</u> can be used for an event that happens every day.

          <b>Weekly</b> <b>events</b>
                 The format <u>MON</u>, <u>TUE</u>, <u>WED</u>, <u>THU</u>, <u>FRI</u>, <u>SAT</u> and <u>SUN</u> can be used for an  event  that  happens  every
                 week.

          <b>Monthly</b> <b>events</b>
                 Use the format <u>000000dd</u>.

          <b>Annual</b> <b>events</b>
                 Use the format <u>0000mmdd</u>.

          <b>Annual:</b> <b>Events</b> <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nth</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b>
                 Use  the format <u>*mmnd</u>.  Where <u>d</u> is the day (1 = Sunday, 7 = Saturday).  Example: *1023 (10=Oct;
                 2="second"; 3=Tuesday ==&gt; Second Tuesday in October, every year).

          <b>Monthly:</b> <b>Events</b> <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nth</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b>
                 Use the format <u>*00nd</u>.  Where <u>d</u> is  the  day  (1  =  Sunday,  7  =  Saturday).   Example:  *0023
                 (2="second"; 3=Tuesday ==&gt; Second Tuesday of every month).

          <b>Annual:</b> <b>Events</b> <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>last</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b>
                 Use  the format <u>*mmLd</u>.  Example: *10L3 (10=Oct; L=Last; 3=Tuesday ==&gt; Last Tuesday in October).
                 This is useful for some holidays.

          <b>Monthly:</b> <b>Events</b> <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>last</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b>
                 Use the format <u>*00Ld</u>.  Example: *00L3 (3=Tuesday ==&gt; Last Tuesday of every month).

          <b>Todo</b> <b>events</b>
                 The format <u>TODO</u> can be used for an event that always happens on the day that you run pal.  This
                 enables you to use pal to keep track of items in your todo list(s).

          <b>Easter</b> <b>related</b> <b>events</b>
                 Use the format <u>Easter</u> for Easter Sunday.  Use the format <u>Easter+nnn</u> for events that  occur  <u>nnn</u>
                 days after Easter.  Use the format <u>Easter‐nnn</u> for events that occur <u>nnn</u> days before easter.

          <b>Recurring</b> <b>events</b> <b>with</b> <b>start</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> <b>dates</b>
                 If  a  recurring  event  has  a  starting  date and an ending date, you can use the date format
                 <u>DATE:START:END</u> where <u>DATE</u> is a recurring date format above.  <u>START</u> and <u>END</u>  are  dates  in  the
                 yyyymmdd  format  that  specify the starting and ending date of the recurring event.  <u>START</u> and
                 <u>END</u> dates are inclusive.  For example, if an event happens every Wednesday in October 2010, you
                 could use this format: <u>WED:20101001:20101031</u>

          <b>Bi-weekly,</b> <b>Bi-annual,</b> <b>etc.</b> <b>events</b>
                 If a recurring event does only occurs every Nth occurence, you can add a <u>/N</u> to the event of the
                 date string for that event.  A start date must be specified.  For example, a  bi-monthly  event
                 that occurs on the first of the month can be specified as <u>00000001/2:20000101</u>.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNATIONALIZATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LOCALIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  calendar files that pal uses must be ASCII encoded or UTF-8 encoded text files (ASCII is a subset of
       UTF-8).  UTF-8 enables the calendar files to work on  any  system  regardless  of  the  default  encoding
       scheme.   When pal prints text, it converts the UTF-8 characters into the local encoding for your system.
       If pal does not display international characters and you are using a UTF-8 calendar file, check  to  make
       sure  that  your locale is set correctly.  You can see your locale settings by running "locale".  You can
       see the character set that pal is using for output by running pal with "-v".  If  pal  does  not  have  a
       translation  for  your  language and you are interested in creating a translation, see the po/README file
       that is distributed with the source code for pal.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.pal/pal.conf">~/.pal/pal.conf</a></u>: Contains configuration information for <b>pal</b> and a list of .pal text  files  that  contain
       events.

       <u>/etc/pal.conf</u>: This pal.conf file is copied to <a href="file:~/.pal/pal.conf">~/.pal/pal.conf</a> when a user runs pal for the first time.

       <u>/usr/share/pal</u>: Contains several calendar files for <b>pal</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Bugs may be reported via <u><a href="http://palcal.sourceforge.net/">http://palcal.sourceforge.net/</a></u>.
