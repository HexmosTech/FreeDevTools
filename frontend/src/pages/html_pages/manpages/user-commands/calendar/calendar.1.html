</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       calendar — reminder service

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>calendar</b> [<b>-abw</b>] [<b>-A</b> <u>num</u>] [<b>-B</b> <u>num</u>] [<b>-l</b> <u>num</u>] [<b>-e</b> <u>num</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>calendarfile</u>] [<b>-t</b> [[[<u>cc</u>]<u>yy</u>]<u>mm</u>]<u>dd</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>calendar</b>  utility  checks  the  current  directory  or  the  directory specified by the CALENDAR_DIR
       environment variable for a file named <u>calendar</u> and displays lines that begin with either today's date  or
       tomorrow's.  On Fridays, events on Friday through Monday are displayed.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-A</b> <u>num</u>  Print lines from today and next <u>num</u> days (forward, future).  Defaults to one (same as -l).

       <b>-a</b>      Process  the “calendar” files of all users and mail the results to them.  This requires superuser
               privileges.

       <b>-B</b> <u>num</u>  Print lines from today and previous <u>num</u> days (backward, past).

       <b>-b</b>      Enforce special date calculation mode for Cyrillic calendars.

       <b>-l</b> <u>num</u>  Print lines from today and next <u>num</u> days (forward, future).  Defaults to one (same as -A).

       <b>-e</b> <u>num</u>  Print lines from today and next <u>num</u> days, only if today is Friday (forward, future).  Defaults to
               two, which causes <b>calendar</b> to print entries through the weekend on Fridays.

       <b>-f</b> <u>calendarfile</u>
               Use <u>calendarfile</u> as the default calendar file.  If this file is not accessible,  the  system-wide
               default is used.

       <b>-t</b> [[[<u>cc</u>]<u>yy</u>]<u>mm</u>]<u>dd</u>
               Act  like  the specified value is “today” instead of using the current date.  If yy is specified,
               but cc is not, a value for yy between 69 and 99 results in a cc value of  19.   Otherwise,  a  cc
               value of 20 is used.

       <b>-w</b>      Print day of the week name in front of each event.

       To handle calendars in your national code table you can specify “LANG=&lt;locale_name&gt;” in the calendar file
       as  early  as  possible.  To handle national Easter names in the calendars, “Easter=&lt;national_name&gt;” (for
       Catholic Easter) or “Paskha=&lt;national_name&gt;” (for Orthodox Easter) can be used.

       A special locale name exists: ‘utf-8’.  Specifying “LANG=utf-8” indicates that the  dates  will  be  read
       using  the  C  locale,  and  the  descriptions  will  be  encoded in UTF-8.  This is usually used for the
       distributed calendar files.  The “CALENDAR” variable can be used to specify the style.  Only ‘Julian’ and
       ‘Gregorian’ styles are currently supported.  Use “CALENDAR=” to return to the default (Gregorian).

       To enforce special date calculation mode for Cyrillic calendars you  should  specify  “LANG=&lt;local_name&gt;”
       and “BODUN=&lt;bodun_prefix&gt;” where &lt;local_name&gt; can be ru_RU.UTF-8, uk_UA.UTF-8 or by_BY.UTF-8.

       Note  that  the  locale  is  reset to the user's default for each new file that is read.  This is so that
       locales from one file do not accidentally carry over into another file.

       Other lines should begin with a month and day.  They may be entered in almost any format, either  numeric
       or  as  character  strings.   If proper locale is set, national months and weekdays names can be used.  A
       single asterisk (‘*’) matches every month.  A day without a month matches that  day  of  every  week.   A
       month  without  a  day matches the first of that month.  Two numbers default to the month followed by the
       day.  Lines with leading tabs default to the last entered date, allowing multiple line specifications for
       a single date.  “Easter” (may be followed by a positive or negative integer) is  Easter  for  this  year.
       “Paskha”  (may be followed by a positive or negative integer) is Orthodox Easter for this year.  Weekdays
       may be followed by “-4” <b>...</b> “+5” (aliases last, first, second, third, fourth) for moving events like “the
       last Monday in April”.

       By convention, dates followed by an asterisk (‘*’) are not fixed, i.e., change from year to year.

       Day descriptions start after the first &lt;tab&gt; character in the line; if the line does not contain a  &lt;tab&gt;
       character,  it isn't printed out.  If the first character in the line is a &lt;tab&gt; character, it is treated
       as the continuation of the previous description.

       The calendar file is preprocessed by <u><a href="../man1/cpp.1.html">cpp</a></u>(1), allowing the inclusion  of  shared  files  such  as  company
       holidays  or  meetings.   If the shared file is not referenced by a full pathname, <u><a href="../man1/cpp.1.html">cpp</a></u>(1) searches in the
       current  (or  home)  directory  first,  and  then  in  the  directory  <u>/etc/calendar</u>,  and   finally   in
       <u>/usr/share/calendar</u>.  Empty lines and lines protected by the C commenting syntax (<b>/*</b> <b>...</b> <b>*/</b>) are ignored.

       Some possible calendar entries (a <b>\t</b> sequence denotes a &lt;tab&gt; character):

             LANG=C
             Easter=Ostern

             #include &lt;calendar.usholiday&gt;
             #include &lt;calendar.birthday&gt;

             6/15<b>\t</b>June 15 (if ambiguous, will default to month/day).
             Jun. 15<b>\t</b>June 15.
             15 June<b>\t</b>June 15.
             Thursday<b>\t</b>Every Thursday.
             June<b>\t</b>Every June 1st.
             15 *<b>\t</b>15th of every month.

             May Sun+2<b>\t</b>second Sunday in May (Muttertag)
             04/SunLast<b>\t</b>last Sunday in April,
             <b>\t</b>summer time in Europe
             Easter<b>\t</b>Easter
             Ostern-2<b>\t</b>Good Friday (2 days before Easter)

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>calendar</b> program previously selected lines which had the correct date anywhere in the line.  This  is
       no longer true: the date is only recognized when it occurs at the beginning of a line.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>calendar</b>  command  will  only  display  lines  that  use  a &lt;tab&gt; character to separate the date and
       description, or that begin with a &lt;tab&gt;.  This is different than in previous releases.

       The Fl t flag argument syntax is from the original FreeBSD <b>calendar</b> program.

       The <b>-l</b> and <b>-e</b> flags are Debian-specific enhancements.  Option <b>-e</b> used to be called <b>-w</b> in Debian, but this
       option is now used differently by upstream.  Also, the original <b>calendar</b> program did not accept <b>0</b>  as  an
       argument to the <b>-A</b> flag.

       Using ‘utf-8’ as a locale name is a Debian-specific enhancement.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       A <b>calendar</b> command appeared in Version 7 AT&amp;T UNIX.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>calendar</b> doesn't handle all Jewish holidays or moon phases.
