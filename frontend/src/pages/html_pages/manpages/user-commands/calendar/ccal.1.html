</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ccal</b> - displays a calendar

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ccal</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ [ <u>num_month</u> ] <u>year</u> ]
       <b>ccal</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>word_month</u> ] [ <u>year</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       By default, <b>ccal</b> will display a calendar for the current month with the current day marked.  By specifing
       certain arguments, <b>ccal</b> will display a calendar for a whole year or a specified month and year.

       The  transition  from  the  Julian to Gregorian calendar is assumed to have occured in 1752 on the 3rd of
       September.  Ten days following that date were eliminated by the reformation, so  the  calendar  for  that
       month is a bit unusual.

       If  displaying a calendar in the single-month format, <b>ccal</b> will look for a date file. If found, <b>ccal</b> will
       read the file, looking for special date descriptions for that month which will be displayed to the  right
       of  the  calendar.   By  default,  up to 24 appointments may be displayed per month.  If the current date
       happens to fall on one of these special dates, it will be flagged by an  asterisk.   If  there  is  room,
       appointments  for  the  next  month may also be displayed with some limitations (currently, special dates
       such as the 3rd Thursday of will not be calculated for next month).

       <b>ccal</b> can also optionally use colors when displaying the calendar.  It will not display  colors  any  time
       the calendar is not directly displaying on the console.  This is generally the desired behavior when your
       redirecting <b>cal's</b> output to another program or a file.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       A  verbally-specified  month  may  be  entered without specifying a year in the argument list; however, a
       single numerical argument will be interpreted as a year.  Only the first 3 characters of the  month  name
       are  significant  for a verbally-specified month.  The command `cal 10' refers to 10 AD, not October, and
       not 1910.

       The available options are:

       <b>--3[months]</b>
              Display previous/current/next month together.  This option will be ignored when displaying a  full
              year.

       <b>--a[ppts]</b>
              Maximum number of appointments to display.  Minimum is 8, maximum is 50, default is 24.

       <b>--col[or-file]=filename</b>
              Read color definitions from `filename' (default color filename depends on operating system).

       <b>--con[tinue]=n</b>
              Display the next <b>n</b> successive months starting with the month specified.

       <b>--d[ata-file]=filename</b>
              Read appointments from `filename' (default appointment data filename depends on operating system).
              You may use -d up to 8 times in a commandline to specify multiple data file names.

       <b>--e[urope]</b>
              Use European format (first weekday is Monday).

       <b>--a[merican]</b>
              Use North American format (first weekday is Sunday), this is the default.

       <b>--f[uture]</b>
              If  current  month  is  displayed,  then  show  only  future  appointments from the date file, not
              appointments that are past.  This allows room for other  descriptions  with  future  dates  to  be
              displayed.   As  time  progresses through the month, old descriptions are discarded and newer ones
              are used.  The --future switch affects only the display for  the  current  month,  and  not  other
              months.

       <b>--j[ulian]</b>
              Display Julian dates (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

       <b>--m[onday]</b>
              Display Monday as the first day of the week (same as --europe)

       <b>--noc[olor]</b>
              Inhibit the use of colors.

       <b>--nod[ata]</b>
              Do not try to read any appointment data file.

       <b>--p[ause]</b>
              Pause before exiting and prompt for a keystroke.

       <b>--th[ismonth]</b>
              Disable display of next month appointments; show only current month's.

       <b>--to[day]</b>
              Show only today's appointments.

       <b>--u[se-color]</b>
              Allow the use of colors.

       <b>--y[ear]</b>
              Display a calendar for the current year.

       There  is an optional environment variable that can be used by <b>ccal</b> if found.  If CALOPT is set then <b>ccal</b>
       will read it and use any valid command line options found.  This allows any commonly used switches to  be
       set  in your environment and always used (e.g. --europe).  <b>Ccal</b> will produce its usage screen when run if
       any invalid options are set in this variable.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ccal</b> <b>--f</b> <b>--d=my_dates</b>
              display the current month and future appointments defined in file `my_dates'

       <b>ccal</b> <b>1996</b>
              display the entire year of 1996

       <b>ccal</b> <b>9</b> <b>1752</b>
              display the month of September 1752

       <b>ccal</b> <b>sep</b> <b>1752</b>
              same as above

       <b>ccal</b> <b>January</b>
              display January of the current year

       <b>ccal</b> <b>help</b>
              help message displayed for unrecognized arguments

</pre><h4><b>DATE</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ccal</b> will search for a date file called <u>cal.dat</u> in the directory it was executed from.  If not  found  it
       will  search  in  the users <u>$HOME</u> directory for a file called <u>.cal.dat.</u>  If still not found, it will look
       for a global <u>cal.dat</u> in a system wide directory.  To find out where this location is  you  can  run  <u>ccal</u>
       <u>--help</u> which will display the location.

       The special date descriptions specified in the date file are single lines, formatted as follows:

        YYYY MM DD NW xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

       where

       <b>YYYY</b>   is the year,

       <b>MM</b>     is the month (01 - 12),

       <b>DD</b>     is the day (00 if the NW field is used),

       <b>NW</b>     is the weekday-of-month code (00 if the DD field is used)

       <b>xxxx</b>   is the description; it will be truncated as necessary to fit

       The  data MUST occupy the character fields as shown.  If YYYY is specified as -999, the month and day are
       assumed to be annual events such as holidays, and the description will be displayed for any year.  If  MM
       is  specified as -9, the day is assumed to be a monthly event for the specified year.  In the weekday-of-
       month code NW, N signifies on which weekday W the special date occurs.  For  example,  31  indicates  the
       third  sunday.   Values of W range from 1 to 7, for Sunday to Saturday, respectively.  A value of 9 for N
       indicates "last" as in 95 for "last thursday."

       If ALL of the fields contain a positive number and the year is at least 1970,  then  the  description  is
       assumed to be periodic, starting at the given date, with the period in days specified in NW (e.g. 1995 01
       06  14  will  display  the description every 2nd Friday using 6 January 1995 as the base date).  The base
       date does not get displayed.

       You can display birthdays and anniversaries by putting the year of birth (or other special event)  inside
       brackets  or  braces, in the description.  This number is converted to the number of years since the year
       you indicate and the brackets or braces are removed from the output.  If braces {} are  used  the  number
       will  have  an ordinal suffix, as in 21st, 32nd, 43rd, 54th, etc.  If the number in brackets or braces is
       greater than the current year, the number will be displayed unchanged.  Example: "Alex's {1961} birthday"
       will display as "Alex's 34th birthday" (if the current year is 1995).  If you need to include brackets or
       braces in your output then you can escape them by prefixing it with a  '\'.   Example:  "Alex's  \{1961\}
       birthday" will be displayed as "Alex's {1961} birthday".

       NOTE:  If <b>ccal</b> is invoked with the --europe or --monday switch, then the W values 1-7 denote <a href="../man1/Monday.1.html">Monday</a>(1) to
       <a href="../man7/Sunday.7.html">Sunday</a>(7) rather than <a href="../man1/Sunday.1.html">Sunday</a>(1) to <a href="../man7/Saturday.7.html">Saturday</a>(7).

       A  line in cal.dat must start with -999 or a 4-digit number to be considered as data.  The data lines may
       be in any order.  All these appointments will be displayed in  chronological  order,  regardless  of  the
       ordering in the appointment data file.

       If  <b>ccal</b> was compiled with the reminder support then <b>ccal</b> will also search for the files <u>dates</u> and <u>.dates</u>
       in the same places as for the <u>cal.dat</u> equivalents.  The <u>dates</u> file is used by the <b><a href="../man1/reminder.1.html">reminder</a></b>(1) program and
       is an alternate, less-powerful format for specifying descriptions.  A  file  in  this  format  cannot  be
       specified with the --data-file= option.

       The <b>reminder</b> format consists of text lines of length &lt; screen width in the following format:

         DDDDDDDD:N:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:yyyyyy:S

       where

       <b>DDDDDDDD</b>
              is the date in one of the following formats:

        M/D/Y an event occurring on a specific day (year can be two or four digits, but must be two for backward
              compatibility with reminder)

        M/D   an event occurring every year

        D     an event occurring every month

        DDD   an event occurring every week (day of the week is 'Sun', 'Mon', etc.)

       <b>N</b>      is the number of days notice of the event to give the user (ignored by <b>ccal</b>)

       <b>xxxxx</b>  the event description

       <b>yyyyy</b>  an optional receptor of the event (e.g. Mr. Jones)

       <b>S</b>      status flag, either N for normal event or D for a deleted (not displayed) event

       Blank  lines are ignored.  A line otherwise not in the above format is assume to specify a file name from
       which to read more events.  The file is searched for in the usual places.

</pre><h4><b>LOCALISATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ccal</b> will also use the user's locale definitions to determine which day to use as the  starting  weekday.
       This is overriden if the -europe or the -american command line switches are used.

       If  you  do  not  set  the  -europe  or  -american switch, your locale is properly defined, and you see a
       different start weekday different from what you would expect, either <b>ccal</b> or your libc definitions are to
       blame. If you think this is a bug in <b>ccal</b> please report it.

</pre><h4><b>COLOR</b> <b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ccal</b> will search for a color definition file called <u>cal.col</u> in the directory it was  executed  from.   If
       not found it will search in the users <u>$HOME</u> directory for a file called <u>.cal.col.</u>  If still not found, it
       will  look  for  a  global  system-wide  <u>/etc/cal.col</u>  You  can  confirm the location for the system-wide
       definition by running <u>ccal</u> <u>--help</u> which will display it.

       Users may override the default colors used when displaying calendars.  This may be  done  by  creating  a
       color definition file in their home directory.

       Example of a color definition file:

        15 02   video colors for month name
        01 03   video colors for weekday header
        07 01   video colors for normal calendar days
        13 01   video colors for sundays
        14 02   video colors for current day
        07 06   bkgd for yearly calendar (space between months)
        11 00   video colors for special day descriptions
        12 08   video colors for * indicating descr.=today

       FG BG

       Color  definitions must appear as above, as a two-character field for the foreground color, followed by a
       space, followed by a two-character field for the background color.  The color definitions must  start  on
       the  first  line, and must not contain blank lines.  Comments may appear after the second field, provided
       that the total line length does not exceed 80 characters.

       Possible colors:

         black           0
         blue            1
         green           2
         cyan            3
         red             4
         violet          5
         orange          6
         light gray      7

         dark gray       8
         bright blue     9
         bright green    10
         bright cyan     11
         bright red      12
         bright violet   13
         yellow          14
         white           15

       Specifying a background color from 8 to 15 will result in a background color of 0  to  7,  with  flashing
       text.
