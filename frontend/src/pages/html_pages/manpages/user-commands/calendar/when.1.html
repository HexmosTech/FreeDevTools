</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       When - a minimalistic personal calendar program

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       when

       when [options] [commands]

       The basic idea is just to type `when' at the command line. The first time you run the program, it will
       prompt you for some setup information. To edit you calendar file in your favorite editor, do `when e'.
       The basic format of the calendar file is like this:

               2003 feb 3 , Fly to Stockholm to accept Nobel Prize.

       Once you have a calendar file, running the program as plain old `when' from the command line will print
       out the things on your calendar for the next two weeks.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>i</b>       Print upcoming items on your calendar. (This is the default command.)

       <b>c</b>       Print  calendars  (grids  like on a wall calendar, not showing items) for last month, this month,
               and next month.

       <b>e</b>       Invoke your favorite editor to edit your calendar file.

       <b>w</b>,<b>m</b>,<b>y</b>   Print items for the coming week, month, or year, rather than for the default period of two weeks.

       <b>j</b>       Print the modified Julian day (useful for finding the time interval between two dates).

       <b>d</b>       Print nothing but the current date.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All of the following options, except --help, can be set in the preferences file. True/false  options  can
       be  set  on the command line as --option or --nooption, and in the preferences file by setting the option
       to 0 or 1.

       --help  Prints a brief help message.

       --version
               Prints a brief message, including a statement of what version of the software it is.

       --language=LANG
               Set the language to LANG. See the section below on  internationalization.   This  option  is  not
               normally needed, because the language is automatically detected.

       --future=DAYS
               How many days into the future the report extends. Default: 14

       --past=DAYS
               How  many  days into the past the report extends. Like the --future option, --past is interpreted
               as an offset relative to the present date, so normally you would  want  this  to  be  a  negative
               value. Default: -1

       --calendar=FILE
               Your  calendar file. The default is to use the file pointed to by your preferences file, which is
               set up the first time you run When.

       --editor=COMMAND
               Command used to invoke your editor. Default: "emacs -nw" Example:  when --editor="vim"

       --wrap=COLUMNS
               Number of columns of text for the output (or 0 if you don't want wrapping at all). Default: 80

       --[no]wrap_auto
               Attempt to detect the width of the terminal, and set the width of the  output  accordingly.  This
               applies  only  if the output is a tty, and is subject to any maximum set by --wrap_max. Overrides
               any value set by --wrap. Default: no

       --wrap_max=COLUMNS
               Maximum number of columns of text for the output (or -1 if you don't want any maximum). Useful in
               combination with --wrap_auto to preserve legibility on very large terminal windows. Default: -1

       --rows=ROWS
               Number of rows of text that will fit in the terminal window.  When listing your calendar,  output
               will  be  truncated to this length, unless that would result in listing less than three days into
               the future. This behavior is overridden (the maximum number of rows is set to  infinity)  if  the
               --future  option  is given explicitly, or if the m or y command is used. To make this option have
               an effect, you will normally need to use --norows_auto as well.  Default: 40

       --[no]rows_auto
               Attempt to detect the height of the terminal, rather than using  the  value  set  in  the  --rows
               option.  This  applies  only if the output is a tty.  Overrides any value set by --rows. Default:
               yes

       --[no]header
               Print headers at the top of the output of the i, c, w, m and y commands.  Default: yes

       --[no]paging
               When the output is longer than the value set by rows or rows_auto, use a  pager  to  display  the
               output.  (The PAGER and LESS environment variables are respected. If PAGER isn't set, the default
               is "less.") Default: yes

       --paging_less_options
               Extra options if the pager is "less." Default: "-rXFE"

       --[no]filter_accents_on_output
               Whether to change accented characters  to  unaccented  ones.   Default:  yes,  unless  the  $TERM
               environment variable equals "mlterm" or "xterm".

       --[no]styled_output
               If the output is a terminal, should we use ANSI terminal codes for styling? Default: yes

       --[no]styled_output_if_not_tty
               Style the output even if it's not a terminal. Default: no

       --calendar_today_style=STYLE
       --items_today_style=STYLE
               The  first  of  these  says  how  to style today's date when doing the calendar (c) command.  The
               second says how to style the word ``today'' when doing the items (i) command.  Defaults: bold

               The styling of output can be specified using the following keywords: bold, underlined,  flashing.
               To  change the color of the text, use these: fgblack, fgred, fggreen, fgyellow, fgblue, fgpurple,
               fgcyan, fgwhite.  To change the background color, use similar keywords, but with  bg  instead  of
               fg. Example: when --calendar_today_style="bold,fgred,bgcyan" c

       --prefilter
               Pipe the calendar file through a program before reading it. Default: ""

       --now="Y M D"
               Pretend today is some other date.

       --[no]neighboring_months
               The  default  behavior of "when c" is to print out calendars for last month, this month, and next
               month. By choosing --noneighboring_months, you can avoid printing out months not included in  the
               range set by --past and --future.

       --[no]monday_first
               Start the week from Monday, rather than Sunday. Default: no

       --[no]orthodox_easter
               Calculate Easter according to the Orthodox Eastern Church's calendar. Default: no

       --[no]ampm
               Display the time of day using 12-hour time, rather than 24-hour time. Also affects the parsing of
               input times.  Default: yes

       --auto_pm=x
               When  times  are input with hours that are less than x, and AM or PM is not explicitly specified,
               automatically assume that they are PM rather than AM. Default: 0

       --[no]literal_only
               Only display items that are given as literal dates, e.g., "2008 jul 4". Don't display items  that
               are defined by expressions, e.g., periodic items like "w=thu". Default: no

       --test_expression
       --bare_version
       --make_filter_regex
       --test_accent_filtering
               These options are used internally for building and testing.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>When</b>  is  an  extremely  simple  personal  calendar  program,  aimed at the Unix geek who wants something
       minimalistic. It can keep track of things you need to do on particular dates. There are a lot of calendar
       and ``personal information manager'' programs out there, so what reasons are there to use <b>When</b>?

       It's a very short and simple program, so you can easily tinker with it yourself. When is about 2400 lines
       of Perl code (not counting documentation), whereas for example the command-line calendar Khal is 17,000,
       and Calcurse is 24,000.
       It doesn't depend on any libraries, so it's easy to install. You should be able to install it on any
       system where Perl is available, even if you don't have privileges for installing libraries.
       Its file format is a simple text file, which you can edit in your favorite editor.

       Although <b>When</b> should run on virtually any operating system where Perl is available, in this document I'll
       assume you're running some flavor of Unix.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>GETTING</b> <b>STARTED</b></h4><pre>
       While logged in as root, execute the following command:

              make install

       Run <b>When</b> for the first time using this command:

              when

       You'll be prompted for some information needed to set up your calendar file.

</pre><h4><b>USE</b></h4><pre>
       If you run <b>When</b> again after the initial setup run, it should print out a single line of text, telling you
       the current date. It won't print out anything else, because your calendar file is  empty,  so  you  don't
       have any appointments coming up.

       Now you can start putting items in your calendar file. Each item is a line of text that looks like this:

               2003 feb 3 , Fly to Stockholm to accept Nobel Prize.

       A convenient way to edit your calendar file is with this command:

               when e

       This pops you into your favorite editor (the one you chose when you ran <b>When</b> for the first time).

       The  date  has to be in year-month-day format, but you can either spell the month or give it as a number.
       (Month names are case-insensitive, and it doesn't matter if you represent February as F, Fe, Feb, Februa,
       or whatever.  It just has to be a unique match. You can give a trailing .,  which  will  be  ignored.  In
       Czech,  "cer"  can  be  used  as an abbreviation for Cerven, and "cec" for Cervenec.) Extra whitespace is
       ignored until you get into the actual text after the comma. Blank lines and lines beginning with a # sign
       are ignored.

       If you now run <b>When</b>, it will print out a list of all the items in your calendar file that fall  within  a
       certain  time  interval.  (The  interval  starts  from  yesterday. <b>When</b> tries to pick the end of the time
       interval so that its output fits on your terminal window, but it will always be at least three days,  and
       no  more  than  two  weeks  in the future.)  To see all your items for the next month, do ``when m'', and
       similarly for a year, y, or a single week, w.

       If you do ``when c'', <b>When</b> prints out calendars for last month, this month, and next month.

       You can combine these commands. For instance, ``when cw'' will print out calendars,  and  then  show  you
       your items for the next week.

       For  events  that occur once a year, such as birthdays and anniversaries, you can either use a * in place
       of the year,

               * dec 25 , Christmas

       or use a year with an asterisk:

               1920* aug 29 , Charlie Parker turns \a, born in \y

       In the second example, \a tells you how old Charlie Parker would be this year, and \y reproduces the year
       he was born, i.e., the output would be:

               today     2003 Aug 29 Charlie Parker turns 83, born in 1920

       For things you have to do every week, you can use an expression of the form w=xxx, where xxx is the first
       few letters of the name of the day of the week in your language. (You have to supply  enough  letters  to
       eliminate ambiguity, e.g., in English, w=th or w=tu, not just w=t.)  Example:

               w=sun , go to church, 10:00

       You  can actually do fancier tests than this as well; for more information, see the section 'fancy tests'
       below.  Here's how to set up some common holidays:

               m=jan &amp; w=mon &amp; a=3 , Martin Luther King Day
               * feb 14 , Valentine's Day
               m=feb &amp; w=mon &amp; a=3 , Washington's Birthday observed
               m=may &amp; w=sun &amp; a=2 , Mother's Day
               m=may &amp; w=mon &amp; b=1 , Memorial Day
               m=jun &amp; w=sun &amp; a=3 , Father's Day
               * jul 4 , Independence Day
               m=sep &amp; w=mon &amp; a=1 , Labor Day
               m=oct &amp; w=mon &amp; a=2 , Columbus Day
               m=nov &amp; w=thu &amp; a=4 , Thanksgiving (U.S.)
               m=oct &amp; w=mon &amp; a=2 , Thanksgiving (Canada)
               m=may &amp; w=mon &amp; (d&gt;=18 &amp; d&lt;=24) , Victoria Day
               * nov 11 , Armistice Day
               e=47 , Mardi Gras
               e=46 , Ash Wednesday
               e=7 , Palm Sunday
               e=0 , Easter Sunday
               e=0-49 , Pentecost (49 days after easter)

       In the U.S., when certain holidays fall on a weekend, federal workers, as well as many private employees,
       get     a     Monday     or      Friday      off.      The      full      list      is      given      at
       <a href="http://www.opm.gov/operating_status_schedules/fedhol/2011.asp">http://www.opm.gov/operating_status_schedules/fedhol/2011.asp</a>.   If  you  want  a  reminder  of  both the
       holiday and the day you get off from work, here's an example of how you would set that up:

               * jul 4 , Independence Day
               m=jul &amp; c=4 , Independence Day (observed as a federal holiday)

</pre><h4><b>COMMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       A line beginning with the # character is taken as a comment, and is ignored.  A line consisting  only  of
       whitespace characters is also ignored.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNATIONALIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>When</b>  has  at  least partial support for Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian,
       Italian, Polish, Romanian, Spanish, Ukrainian and Portuguese.  If <b>When</b> has not been translated into  your
       language,  or  has only been partially translated, the text that hasn't been translated will be displayed
       in English.  <b>When</b> should  automatically  detect  what  language  you  use  (via  your  $LANG  environment
       variable),  and  if  <b>When</b> has been translated into that language, that's what you'll get -- <b>When</b>'s output
       will be in your language, and <b>When</b> will also expect you to use that language in your  calendar  file  for
       the names of the months and the days of the week.

       Your  calendar file must be in UTF-8 (or ASCII, which is a subset of UTF-8).  If your calendar file is in
       some other encoding, such as ISO-8859, <b>When</b> will typically be able to detect that,  and  will  refuse  to
       read it.  Command-line options can also contain UTF-8.

       Some  terminal  emulators  (aterm,  ...)  display  accented  characters  as  garbage, but others (mlterm,
       xterm...) can display them correctly.  <b>When</b> checks the $TERM  environment  variable,  and  if  it  equals
       "mlterm"  or "xterm", then accented characters will be displayed. Otherwise, they are filtered out of the
       output.  You can override this by putting a line like

               filter_accents_on_output = 0

       or

               filter_accents_on_output = 1

       in your preferences file. I'd be interested in hearing from any users who can suggest a better  mechanism
       for this than attempting to interpret the $TERM variable.

       On input, accents are allowed, but not required, e.g., in a French-language input file, the date 2005 Fev
       17 could be given with an accented e or an unaccented one, and either will work. If an input month or day
       of  the  week  does  not  match  any of the ones for your language, then <b>When</b> will try to interpret it as
       English instead.

       You can put a line like

               language = fr

       in your preferences file to set your language, or supply the --language option on the command  line,  but
       that's not necessary if your $LANG environment variable is set correctly.

</pre><h4><b>LOCATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>PREFERENCES</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Most people will have their preferences file in <a href="file:~/.when/preferences.">~/.when/preferences.</a>  Those who prefer to keep their home
       directory  uncluttered  with  dotfiles can use one of the following standard possibilities defined by the
       XDG    standard.     In    decreasing     order     of     priority:     ${WHEN_CONFIG_HOME}/preferences,
       ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/when/preferences, $HOME/.config/when/preferences, and $HOME/.when/preferences.

       Each line consists of something like this:

               variable = value

       Whitespace  is  ignored  everywhere  except  inside the value. Variable names are case-insensitive. Blank
       lines are ignored. Comments are allowed, prefaced by #.

</pre><h4><b>MORE</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       A useful command to have your shell execute when you log in is this:

               when --past=0 --future=1

       To print out a calendar for a full year to come:

               when --past=0 --future=365 c

</pre><h4><b>POPPING</b> <b>UP</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>CALENDAR</b> <b>WHEN</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>LOG</b> <b>IN</b></h4><pre>
       Your calendar doesn't do you any good if you forget to look at it every day. An easy way to make  it  pop
       up when you log in is to make your .xsession or .xinitrc file look like this:

               /usr/bin/when --past=0 --future=1 &amp;&gt;<a href="file:~/when.today">~/when.today</a>
               emacs -geometry 70x25 -bg bisque <a href="file:~/when.today">~/when.today</a> &amp;
               startkde

       The  .xsession file is used if you have a graphical login manager set up on your machine, the .xinitrc if
       you don't. In this example, the first line outputs your calendar to a file. The complete path to the <b>When</b>
       program is given, because your shell's path variable will not yet be properly initialized when this runs.
       The second line pops up a GUI emacs window, which is distinctively colored so that  it  will  catch  your
       eye. The last line starts your window manager, KDE in this example. Whatever window manager you use, just
       make  sure to retain the preexisting line in the file that starts it, and make sure that that line is the
       very last one in the file.

</pre><h4><b>SORTING</b> <b>BY</b> <b>TIME</b> <b>OF</b> <b>DAY</b></h4><pre>
       If you want the various items that lie on a single day to be printed out in a certain order, the simplest
       way to do it is to put them in that order in the input file. That method won't work, however,  when  some
       of  the  items  lie  on  dates  that are determined by expressions rather than given explicitly. The most
       common reason for wanting to do this kind of thing is that you have things you  need  to  do  at  certain
       times during the day, and you want them sorted out by time. In this situation, you can give a time at the
       beginning  of  the  item's text, and <b>When</b> will recognize that and sort the items by time. Times can be in
       h:mm or hh:mm format. If --ampm is set, then an optional suffix a or p can be used for AM  or  PM,  e.g.,
       9:30a  for  9:30  AM.  If you use AM/PM time, then you can also, e.g., set --auto_pm=9 so that hours less
       than 9 are automatically assumed to be PM. Here is an example:

               2010 apr 25 , 7:00 dinner at the anarcho-syndicalist commune
               w=sun , 10:00 church

       April 25, 2010 is a Sunday, so on that date both of these items will be displayed.  If --auto_pm  is  set
       to  8  or higher, then the 7:00 will automatically be interpreted as 7:00 PM, and the dinner date will be
       displayed below the morning church ceremony.

</pre><h4><b>FANCY</b> <b>TESTS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to w, discussed above, there are a bunch of other variables you can test:

               w  -  day of the week
               m  -  month
               d  -  day of the month
               y  -  year
               j  -  modified Julian day number
               a  -  1 for the first 7 days of the month, 2 for the next 7, etc.
               b  -  1 for the last 7 days of the month, 2 for the previous 7, etc.
               c  -  on Monday or Friday, equals the day of the month of the nearest weekend day; otherwise -1
               n  -  number of days in this month
               e  -  days until this year's (Western) Easter
               z  -  day of the year (1 on New Year's day)

       You can specify months either as numbers, m=2, or as names in your language, m=feb.  You can also use the
       logical operators &amp; (and) and | (or). The following example reminds you to  pay  your  employees  on  the
       first and fifteenth day of every month:

               d=1 | d=15 , Pay employees.

       This example reminds you to rehearse with your band on the last Saturday of every month:

               w=sat &amp; b=1 , Rehearse with band.

       The following two lines

               * dec 25 , Christmas
               m=dec &amp; d=25 , Christmas

       both  do  exactly the same thing, but the first version is easier to understand and makes the program run
       faster. (When you do a test, <b>When</b> has to run through every day in the range of dates you asked  for,  and
       evaluate  the  test  for  each  of those days. On my machine, if I print out a calendar for a whole year,
       using a file with 10 simple tests in it, it takes a few seconds.)  Parentheses can be used, too.

       Depending on your nationality and religion, you probably have a bunch of holidays that don't lie on fixed
       dates. In Christianity, many of these (the "movable feasts") are calculated relative  to  Easter  Sunday,
       which is why the e variable is useful.

       There is a not operator, !:

               w=fri &amp; !(m=dec &amp; d=25) , poker game

       There is a modulo operator, %, and a subtraction operator, -.  Using these, along with the j variable, it
       is just barely possible for <b>When</b>'s little parser to perform the following feat:

               !(j%14-1) , do something every other Wednesday

       The  logic  behind  this  silly  little piece of wizardry goes like this.  First, we determine, using the
       command `when j --now="2005 jan 26"', that the first Wednesday on which we want to do this has  a  Julian
       day  that equals 1, modulo 14. Then we write this expression so that if it's a Wednesday whose Julian day
       equals 1, modulo 14, the quantity in parentheses will be zero, and taking its logical negation will yield
       a true value.

       The operators' associativity and order of priority (from highest to lowest) is like this:

               left    %
               left    -
               left    &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=
               left    = !=
               right   !
               left    &amp;
               left    |

       If your calendar file gets too large, you may prefer to split it up into smaller chunks  --  perhaps  one
       for  birthdays,  one  for  Tibetan  holidays,  etc.   An easy way of accomplishing this is to install the
       program m4, put the line

               prefilter = m4 -P

       in your preferences file, and then put lines in your calendar file like this:

               m4_include(/home/yourname/.when/birthdays)

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$LANG</b> to automatically detect the user's language

       <b>$TERM</b> to try to figure out if the terminal emulator can display accented characters

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$HOME</b>/.when/calendar - The default location for the user's calendar (pointed to by the preferences file)

       <b>$HOME</b>/.when/preferences - The user's preferences. (See above for alternative locations, which follow  the
       XDG standard.)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  filename  of the calendar file cannot have unicode in it.  This is because perl's <b>File::Glob::glob()</b>
       function          does          not           support           unicode           properly.           See
