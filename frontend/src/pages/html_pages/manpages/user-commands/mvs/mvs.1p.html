</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "mvs" is a command line client whose purpose is to simplify offline editing of Wiki content.  It allows
       you to get any number of pages from a given Mediawiki site, edit the pages with any editor, get and merge
       any concurrent updates of the pages, and then safely commit the users own changes back to the version of
       the page on the server.

       The "mvs" commands which take a filename argument only accept a single filename as so to avoid taking up
       too much server bandwidth.

       <b>Note:</b>Users of "mvs" from before version 0.27 will notice that in this documentation the options are
       mostly listed after the "mvs" sub-command.  This makes "mvs" behave more like "cvs", "svn", or "tla", and
       so should make it easier for people who are used to using those programs.  If you prefer to use "mvs" the
       old way, that will still work, at least for the next few versions.

</pre><h4><b>QUICKSTART</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Step</b> <b>1:</b>  <b>Create</b> <b>an</b> <b>account</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mediawiki</b> <b>server.</b>
       This should be done the normal way, by visiting the Mediawiki website to which you want to contribute and
       creating a new account, setting the preferences, etc.

       It should hopefully go without saying that you will want to become familiar with the editorial, usage,
       and copyright guidelines of the site.  You should probably also make some contributions through the
       normal UI, and learn about following recent changes before contributing using mvs.

       In addition for the sake of this test you should already have a user page like User:&lt;username&gt; with
       something on it, where &lt;username&gt; is the user name with which you established the account.

   <b>Step</b> <b>2:</b>  <b>Create</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> <b>directory</b>
       "mvs" works with Mediawiki formatted files with a ".wiki" extension and which are stored together with
       server information in a <u>working</u> <u>directory</u>.  You will have to have <u>at</u> <u>least</u> one working directory for each
       Mediawiki site to which you contribute.

       Simply use "mkdir" or the equivalent to make a new directory, and then before cd into that directory.

         mkdir wikitravel.en
         cd wikitravel.en

       All of the operations below should be done from this directory.

   <b>Step</b> <b>3:</b>  <b>Login</b> <b>using</b> <b>"mvs</b> <b>login"</b>
       To use login you will need to know the <u>host</u>name for the Mediawiki site to which you want to contribute.

         www.wikitravel.org

       Now use the <u>host</u> with your username and password to login.

         mvs login -d www.wikitravel.org -u &lt;username&gt; -p 'secret'

       If "mvs" knows about your Mediawiki host it will set set the "wiki_path" to the correct default for that
       server.  In this case it will also be able to select the language version of that Wiki for you if you
       specify a "language_code":

         mvs login -d www.wikitravel.org -l fr -u &lt;username&gt; -p 'secret'

       The code must match the one which your wiki host uses for a given language, and of course the language
       version must exist for the given host.

       If the wiki requires Basic HTTP Authentication, use -b.

       If your Mediawiki install uses a nonstandard path to the wiki script you can specify it on login.  The
       path to the wiki script is the part of the URL after the host name, and before the '?':

         mvs login \
           -d www.wikitravel.org \
           -u &lt;username&gt; \
           -p 'secret' \
           -w 'mw/wiki.phtml'

       You can change the edit and action paths in the created .mediawiki file after successful login
       accordingly.

       Now anything you submit to the Mediawiki server will be credited to user "&lt;username&gt;".

       <b>NOTE:</b> If you have been using an earlier version of "mvs" you should probably delete the .mediawiki file
       in your working directory.

   <b>Step</b> <b>4:</b>  <b>Use</b> <b>"mvs</b> <b>update"</b> <b>to</b> <b>fetch</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>working</b> <b>files</b>
       You can fetch existing material off of the site, or create new pages with "mvs update", remembering that
       your files will need a ".wiki" extension:

         mvs update User:&lt;username&gt;.wiki User:&lt;username&gt;/Test_Page.wiki

       This should produce the output:

         U User:&lt;username&gt;.wiki
         A User:&lt;username&gt;/Test_Page.wiki

       The U (for Updated) means that User:&lt;username&gt; was found on the server and its contents inserted into the
       local files.  The A (for Added) means that the User:&lt;username&gt;/Test_Page.wiki page does not yet exist on
       the server, and will be added when you run "mvs commit".

       Note that both of the pages we are working with are within <u>your</u> User Namespace.  It's probably a good
       idea to restrict yourself to working with such pages while you are experimenting with "mvs"

   <b>Step</b> <b>5:</b>  <b>Edit</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>corrections</b> <b>and</b> <b>contributions</b>
       Use your favorite text editor to edit the files.  You might want to check out this page to see if there
       is a Mediawiki syntax highlighting file for your editor:

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia</a>:Syntax_highlighting

       Of course if you don't find a highlighting file for you editor you are welcome to create one and submit
       it to the page above.

   <b>Step</b> <b>6:</b>  <b>Use</b> <b>"mvs</b> <b>commit"</b> <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>your</b> <b>changes</b>
       When you are done editing a file and would like to submit your changes to the wiki server use "mvs
       commit" to do so:

         mvs commit -m 'commit message' User:&lt;username&gt;.wiki

       Where 'commit message' is whatever you want to say about the changes you are submitting and why.  You
       must provide a commit message or "mvs commit" will fail.  You might also find that "mvs commit" fails
       complaining that the file has changed on the server.  If this is the case you will need to use "mvs
       update" again to get the most recent changes.

   <b>Step</b> <b>7:</b> <b>Update</b> <b>your</b> <b>wiki</b> <b>files</b>
       You can use "mvs update" again at any time to reconcile any of your files with the most recent changes
       from the server.  Your changes <u>will</u> <u>not</u> be overwritten, but rather "mvs" will try to merge any server
       changes into the files as they exist in your working directory.  Note that update and commit only work on
       one file at a time, as so to help prevent accidents and server congestion.

       If for some reason there is a conflict, i.e. you and someone else have made changes which appear to be
       incompatible, and cannot be resolved then your file will contain a <u>conflict</u> <u>message</u>, as detailed in the
       documentation for "mvs update" below.  You <u>must</u> resolve any conflicts <u>before</u> attempting to use "mvs
       commit" on the file.  This is usually a very simple matter of choosing one version of the change or
       another.  You should use your best judgement, consulting the relevant "Talk:" page to try to work out an
       agreement with the other contributor in cases where you just simply disagree.

   <b>Repeat</b>
       You can continue editing and committing changes with the files in your working directory.  It might be a
       good idea for you to eventually create multiple working directories per site, perhaps grouping them by
       subject.  This will work fine with "mvs" since it does <u>not</u> need to have a complete copy of all of the
       pages from a given server in a given working directory to work.

</pre><h4><b>CHARACTER</b> <b>ENCODING</b></h4><pre>
       All of your ".wiki" files should be stored with UTF-8 encoding.  Upon login to a given server mvs will
       determine the encoding used by that server, and will upload in that encoding only.  For servers using
       non-UTF-8 character sets you should use HTML entities for any character you want to represent which is
       outside of the server's character set.  This includes the english Wikipedia.  Most newer Mediawiki sites
       however do use UTF-8, on these sites HTML entities are <u>never</u> needed.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Commands</b>
       The first argument after the options should be one of the following two commands:

       mvs login
           Allows  the  user  to  login  to  the  Mediawiki server using an <u>existing</u> login and password for that
           server.  After calling "login" all "commit"s from the same working directory will be logged  as  from
           the logged-in user.

       mvs update
           Updates the specified file[s] with content from the Mediawiki server.  If a file does not exist it is
           created  and  populated  with  the  current  online version.  If there is no online version, the file
           either created and left blank, or just left as it is.  If there is content in both the specified file
           and in the corresponding Wiki page, an attempt is made to merge the two, line by line.   Files  which
           are the same as the server version are ignored.

           If  no  filenames  are  given  on  the  command  line, all visible files with the .wiki extension are
           processed.

           Conflicting changes to a given line are detected on the basis of the date of the most  recent  update
           of  the local file and date of the most recent change to the online Wiki page.  If a line has changed
           in both the online page and the local file it is flagged as  a  conflict,  as  in  CVS,  but  with  a
           slightly different syntax:

             ********************Start of conflict 1  Insert to Primary, Insert to Secondary ************************************************************

             The line as it appears on the server

             ****************************************************************************************************

             The line as it appears locally
             ********************End of conflict 1********************************************************************************

           "mvs update" reports the status of files which it touches to STDERR with a letter indicating the file
           status, and then name of the file, again like CVS.  The status letters are:

           = (Unchanged)
               The file is the same as the page on the server.

           A (Added)
               The file will become a new page on the wiki server.

           M (Modified)
               The file has been modified locally.

           U (Updated)
               The file has been updated with changes from the wiki server.

           C (Conflicts)
               The file contains conflict markers.

           ? (Unknown)
               Neither the file, nor a corresponding server page exist.

       commit
           Commits any changes in the specified local file to the Wiki site.  A check is made first to make sure
           that  there  are  no  changes on the server more recent than the most recent update.  Nothing will be
           comitted if the file and server version are identical.

           When running "mvs commit" you <u>must</u> use the "-m" flag to  send  a  commit  message  to  the  Mediawiki
           server.  e.g.:

             mvs commit -m 'Added Hotel Eldorado' Paris.wiki

       preview
           This  command  functions  identically  to  "mvs  commit",  except that nothing is actually committed.
           Instead, the file is uploaded and the Mediawiki server sends back a formatted preview.  The "-m" flag
           is optional.  If you set the MVS_BROWSER environmental variable to the  path  and  filename  of  your
           favorite browser, mvs will launch it with the preview page.

       clean
           This command removes any local version reference files relating to pages you've deleted.

             rm Paris.wiki
             mvs clean

   <b>File</b> <b>names</b>
       Any  additional  arguments  are  taken as <u>local</u> filenames to be processed.  The local filename of a given
       Mediawiki page will be the same as its URL encoded name with the extension ".wiki".  If no arguments  are
       given then any filenames with the "wiki" extension and under the current directory are processed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>-h</b>
       Display usage information.

   <b>-D</b>
       Print information about known Mediawiki servers, then exit.

   <b>-q</b>
       Causes the command to be quiet.  Informational messages are suppressed.

   <b>-u</b> <b>"&lt;username&gt;"</b>
       Specifies a username for "mvs login".

   <b>-p</b> <b>"&lt;password&gt;"</b>
       Specifies a password for "mvs login".

   <b>-l</b> <b>"&lt;language_code&gt;"</b>
       The language code the wiki server uses to differentiate between language versions.

   <b>-m</b> <b>"&lt;your</b> <b>message&gt;"</b>
       A commit message for "mvs commit".  Use this to explain the nature of your changes.

   <b>-s</b> <b>"&lt;your</b> <b>message&gt;"</b>
       Same as "-m"

   <b>--minor</b> <b>&lt;yes|no|default&gt;</b>
       Choose  whether to mark change as a minor edit.  The default is to mark changes as minor if the Mediawiki
       user profile is set to do so by default.  Use  this  when  committing  a  change  with  "mvs  commit"  or
       previewing with "mvs preview".

   <b>-M</b>
       Same as "--minor yes".

   <b>--watch</b> <b>&lt;yes|no|keep|default&gt;</b>
       Choose  whether  to  add  the edited page to your watchlist.  Specifying "keep" will maintain the current
       watched status.  The default is to watch the page if it is already being watched,  or  if  the  Mediawiki
       user  profile  is  set  to  do  so  by  default.   Use this when committing a change with "mvs commit" or
       previewing with "mvs preview".

   <b>-W</b>
       Same as "--watch yes".

   <b>-w</b> <b>"&lt;wiki</b> <b>path&gt;"</b>
       The path on the given "host" to the Mediawiki script.  This defaults to <u>wiki/wiki.phtml</u> which is  correct
       for a vanilla install of Mediawiki 1.4.x.

   <b>-v</b>
       Verbose.   If  this  is  set "mvs" will give you lots of extra information about what it's doing.  The -q
       flag overrides this.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENTAL</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>MVS_BROWSER</b>
       The browser you prefer to use for previewing changes.

   <b>HTTP_PROXY</b>
       A proxy server to use (if any), expressed as a standard URL, something like this:

         export HTTP_PROXY=http://[username:password@]proxy.myorg.org:8080

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       This is an early version of this program.  Future versions may have major differences which  will  effect
       your  ability  to  use them interchangeably with this one.  In particular the initial "command" arguments
       may become options and the handling of conflicts might change dramatically.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
