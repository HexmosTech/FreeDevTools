</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <u>tgif</u>  -  Xlib  based  interactive  2-D drawing facility under X11.  Supports hierarchical construction of
       drawings and easy navigation between sets of drawings.  It's also a hyper-graphics (or  hyper-structured-
       graphics) browser on the World-Wide-Web.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Tgif</u>  is  an interactive drawing tool that allows the user to draw and manipulate objects in the X Window
       System.  Tgif runs interactively in the first form.  In the second form shown in  the  SYNOPSIS  section,
       tgif  just  prints  <u>file1.obj</u>,  <u>file2.obj</u>, etc.  (generated by <u>tgif</u>) into PostScript(TM) page description
       files (without opening windows or fonts) and pipes them to  <a href="../man1/lpr.1.html">lpr</a>(1)  if  none  of  the  <b>-eps</b>,  <b>-p</b>,  <b>-epsi</b>,
       <b>-tiffepsi</b>,  <b>-gif</b>,  <b>-png</b>,  <b>-jpeg</b>,  <b>-ppm</b>,  <b>-pbm</b>, <b>-xpm</b>, <b>-xbm</b>, <b>-html</b>, <b>-pdf</b>, <b>-ps</b>, <b>-f</b>, <b>-text</b>, <b>-netlist</b>, or <b>-svg</b>
       options are specified.  This form of <u>printing</u> is tgif's way of <u>exporting</u> a tgif file to  another  format.
       In  this  case,  any  other  unrecognized command line options are sent to <a href="../man1/lpr.1.html">lpr</a>(1).  In this mode, tgif is
       compatible with the obsoleted <u>prtgif</u>.  A symbol file (see descriptions below)  can  also  be  printed  by
       specifying the <u>.sym</u> extension explicitly.

       The  command  line  argument  <u>file</u> specifies a file or an Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of objects to be
       initially edited by tgif.  Only HTTP or FTP URL's are supported.  (For a more detailed description of URL
       and the World-Wide-Web, the reader is referred to [1].)

       Tgif is purely based on <u>Xlib</u>.  It is tested under X11R6, and it requires a 3 button mouse.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In the first form shown in the SYNOPSIS section, the command line arguments can be:

       <b>-fg</b>    Foreground color specified in &lt;color&gt;.

       <b>-bg</b>    Background color specified in &lt;color&gt;.

       <b>-bd</b>    Border color specified in &lt;color&gt;.

       <b>-rv</b>    Start tgif in reversed-video mode.

       <b>-nv</b>    Start tgif in normal-video mode.

       <b>-bw</b>    Start tgif in black and white mode.

       <b>-reqcolor</b>
              Same effect as setting the Tgif.PrintUsingRequestedColor X default to true  (see  the  X  DEFAULTS
              section below).

       <b>-cwo</b>   Canvas Window Only.  Only the canvas window (see TGIF SUBWINDOWS section below) will be displayed.
              This has the same effect as setting the Tgif.CanvasWindowOnly X default to true.

       <b>-cwo+sbwarp</b>
              If  <b>-cwo+sbwarp</b>  is  used,  single-button-warp (clicking the left mouse button to warp) is used to
              activate teleporting (see TELEPORT/HYPERJUMP section below).

       <b>-hyper</b> Start tgif in the <u>hyperspace</u> mode (see HYPERSPACE section below).

       <b>-exec</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              After tgif starts, execute the internal command in &lt;file&gt; (see INTERNAL COMMANDS  section  below).
              If &lt;file&gt; is the string "-", tgif executes internal commands from the standard input.

       <b>-dbim</b> <u>method</u>
              Use <u>method</u> as the input method for double-byte fonts (see SQUARE DOUBLE BYTE FONTS section below).
              This cannot be used in conjunction with <u>-sbim</u>.

       <b>-sbim</b> <u>method</u>
              Use  <u>method</u> as the input method for single-byte fonts.  This is useful if the X Keyboard Extension
              is used in inputing international characters (with dead keys).  This cannot be used in conjunction
              with <u>-dbim</u>.

       <b>-usexlib</b>
              If tgif is compiled with -DUSE_XT_INITIALIZE, X Toolkit initialization routines will  be  used  to
              setup  tgif.   Using  this  command  line option will force tgif to ignore the -DUSE_XT_INITIALIZE
              compiler option and use Xlib only.  This is useful when the system resource file for tgif  is  not
              installed properly or messed up and needs to be bypassed.

       <b>-a4</b>    Using this option has the same effect as setting the Tgif.PSA4PaperSize X default to true.

       <b>-letter</b>
              Using this option has the same effect as setting the Tgif.InitialPaperSize X default to "letter"

       <b>-noshowpageineps</b>
              Using this option has the same effect as setting the Tgif.ShowPageInEPS X default to false.

       <b>-quiet</b> If this option is used, tgif will suppress standard messages.

       <b>-listdontreencode=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              If  this  option  is  used, tgif will print out the list of PostScript font names specified in the
              -D_DONT_REENCODE compiler option used in compiling tgif.

       In the second form shown in the SYNOPSIS section, the command line arguments can be:

       <b>-version</b>
              If this option is used, tgif will print out its version number and copyright on the command line.

       <b>-justversion</b>
              If this option is used, tgif will print out its version number and copyright on the  command  line
              and exits immediately.

       <b>-nomode</b>
              Using this option has the same effect as setting the Tgif.NoModeWindow X default to true.

       <b>-eps</b> (or <b>-p</b>)
              Generates  an  Encapsulated  PostScript(TM) file in <u>file.eps</u>; this file can be included in a LaTeX
              file through the \psfig, \epsf, or \psfile construct (see the LATEX FIGURE FORMATS section below).

       <b>-ps</b> (or <b>-f</b>)
              Generates a PostScript file in <u>file.ps</u>; this file can be printed  to  a  PostScript  printer  with
              <a href="../man1/lpr.1.html">lpr</a>(1).

       <b>-text</b>  Generates  a  text  file  in <u>file.txt</u>; the text file contains all visible text and can be fed to a
              spell checker.

       <b>-epsi</b>  Generates an Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file with a preview bitmap in <u>file.eps</u>.  Tgif aborts if
              a valid display is not accessible.

       <b>-tiffepsi</b>
              Generates an EPS file with a DOS EPS Binary File Header and a trailing  TIFF  image  in  <u>file.eps</u>.
              See  the GENERATING MICROSOFT WINDOWS EPSI FILES section for more details.  Tgif aborts if a valid
              display is not accessible.

       <b>-gif</b>   Generates a GIF file in <u>file.gif</u>.  Please see the  notes  for  Tgif.GifToXpm  in  the  X  DEFAULTS
              section below.  Tgif aborts if a valid display is not accessible.

       <b>-png</b>   Generates a PNG file in <u>file.png</u>.  Tgif aborts if a valid display is not accessible.

       <b>-jpeg</b>  Generates a JPEG file in <u>file.jpg</u>.  Tgif aborts if a valid display is not accessible.

       <b>-ppm</b>   Generates a PPM file in <u>file.ppm</u>.  Tgif aborts if a valid display is not accessible.

       <b>-pbm</b>   Generates a PBM file in <u>file.pbm</u>.  Tgif aborts if a valid display is not accessible.

       <b>-xpm</b>   Generates an X11 pixmap (XPM) file in <u>file.xpm</u>.  Tgif aborts if a valid display is not accessible.

       <b>-xbm</b>   Generates an X11 bitmap (XBM) file in <u>file.xbm</u>.  Tgif aborts if a valid display is not accessible.

       <b>-html</b>  Generates a GIF file in <u>file.gif</u> and an HTML file in <u>file.html</u>.  Tgif aborts if a valid display is
              not accessible.

       <b>-pdf</b>   Generates a PDF file in <u>file.pdf</u>.  Please see the notes for Tgif.PsToPdf in the X DEFAULTS section
              below.

       <b>-netlist</b>
              Generates  a  text  file  in  <u>file.net</u>  and  a  text  file in <u>file.cmp</u>.  <u>file.net</u> contains netlist
              information stored in a table.  The first line in it contains column names and each line in it  is
              a  port name (surrounded by double-quotes), followed by a comma and a &lt;TAB&gt; character, followed by
              a signal name (also surrounded by double-quotes).  <u>file.cmp</u> contains information about  components
              in  the  file.   Each  component  begins  with its name followed by its type.  The attributes of a
              component are printed afterwards (indented by &lt;TAB&gt; characters).

       <b>-svg</b>   Generates an SVG file in <u>file.svg</u>.  Please see the notes for Tgif.EpsToTmpSvg and Tgif.TmpSvgToSvg
              in the X DEFAULTS section below.

       <b>-stdout</b>
              Sends the output to the standard output instead of generating the output in a file.

       <b>-raw</b>   Causes the content of the files to be dumped to stdout.

       <b>-raw+h</b> If <b>-raw+h</b> is used and if the file is an HTTP URL, the HTTP header is also dumped to stdout.

       <b>-raw+headeronly</b>
              If <b>-raw+headeronly</b> is used and if the file is an HTTP URL, the HTTP header is dumped to stdout.

       <b>-dosepsfilter</b>
              Makes tgif act as a filter for getting rid of the DOS EPS Binary File Header and the trailing TIFF
              image in a DOS/Windows EPS file.

       <b>-previewonly</b>
              If <b>-dosepsfilter</b> is specified, <b>-previewonly</b> makes tgif act as a filter for extracting the  preview
              bitmap from the trailing TIFF image in a DOS/Windows EPS file.

       <b>-status</b>
              If this option is used in conjunction with either <b>-raw</b>, <b>-raw+h</b>, or <b>-raw+headeronly</b> causes a status
              line to be displayed in stderr.

       <b>-gray</b>  Using  this option has the same effect as setting the Tgif.UseGrayScale X default to true (see the
              X DEFAULTS section below).

       <b>-color</b> (or <b>-reqcolor</b>)
              To print in color, one can use either the <b>-color</b> or the <b>-reqcolor</b>  option.   The  only  difference
              between   the   two   is   that   using   <b>-reqcolor</b>   has   the   same   effect   as  setting  the
              Tgif.PrintUsingRequestedColor X default to true (see the X DEFAULTS section below).

       <b>-adobe</b> (or <b>-adobe=&lt;number&gt;/&lt;number&gt;</b> <b>-adobe=false</b>)
              Using this option has the same effect as specifying the Tgif.UsePsAdobeString X default.

       <b>-dontreencode=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Using this option has the same effect as specifying the Tgif.DontReencode X default.

       <b>-producedby=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Using this option has the same effect as specifying the Tgif.ProducedBy X default.

       <b>-page</b>  Causes a specified page (specified by &lt;number&gt;) to be printed.

       <b>-print_cmd</b>
              Using this option has the same effect as specifying the Tgif.PrintCommand X default.

       <b>-one_file_per_page</b>
              Causes each page to be printed into a separate file.

       <b>-pepsc</b> Preserve EPS Comment.  This command line option became obsolete  since  EPS  comments  are  always
              preserved starting from tgif-4.0.11.

       <b>-nolandpdfspd</b>
              This commandline option became obsolete in tgif-4.1.42.  It is interpreted as -nopdfspd.

       <b>-pdfspd</b> (or <b>-pdfspd=true</b> <b>-pdfspd=false</b>)
              If  -pdfspd  or  -pdfspd=true is specified, "setpagedevice" is generated in the interim PostScript
              file when exporting PDF files or in the  final  PostScript  file  when  exporting  PS  files.   If
              -pdfspd=false  is  specified,  no "setpagedevice" will be generated in the interim PostScript file
              when exporting PDF files or in the final PostScript file when exporting  PS  files.   This  option
              overrides the Tgif.PdfSetPageDevice X default.

       <b>-pssetup</b>
              Using these options have the same effect as specifying the Tgif.AdditionalPSSetup X default.

       <b>-tgwb2</b> This  commandline option enables the Tangram Whiteboard feature in tgif.  It requires <b>librmcast.so</b>
              (Reliable IP-multicast library).  The location of the rmcast  library  can  be  specified  by  the
              optional  commandline  argument <b>-rmcastlibdir</b>.  Alternatively, the full path to the rmcast library
              can be specified by using the optional commandline argument <b>-rmcastlibpath</b>.  (Please note that the
              rmcast library has only been extensively tested on Linux machines.)

       <b>-j2p6_cmd</b>
              Using this option has the same effect as specifying the Tgif.JpegToPpm6 X default.

       <b>-dontcondense</b>
              Using this option has the same effect as setting the Tgif.DontCondensePSFile X default to true.

       <b>-condensed</b>
              Using this option has the same effect as setting the Tgif.DontCondensePSFile X default to false.

       <b>-bop_hook</b> and <b>-eop_hook</b>
              Using these options have the same effect as specifying the  Tgif.PSBopHook  and  Tgif.PSEpsHook  X
              defaults.

       <b>-tmp_file_mode</b>
              Using this option have the same effect as specifying the Tgif.TmpFileMode X defaults.

       <b>-patterndir</b>
              Using this option have the same effect as specifying the Tgif.CustomPatternDir X defaults.

       <b>-o</b>     If  this option is not specified, the output file (eps, ps, etc.)  goes into the same directory as
              the input file.  If <b>-o</b>&lt;dir&gt; is specified, the output file goes into  the  directory  specified  by
              <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>.

       <b>-merge</b> <u>file1</u> <u>file2</u> ...
              Using this option merges <u>file1</u>.obj, <u>file2</u>.obj, etc.  into a multipage file.

</pre><h4><b>BASIC</b> <b>FUNCTIONALITIES</b></h4><pre>
       Primitive  objects  supported  by tgif are rectangles, ovals, rounded-corner rectangles, arcs, polylines,
       polygons, open-splines, closed-splines, text, X11 bitmaps,  some  specific  forms  of  X11  pixmaps,  and
       Encapsulated PostScript.  (Please note that the splines tgif draw are <u>not</u> Bezier curves.)  Objects can be
       grouped  together  to  form  a  <u>grouped</u> object.  A primitive or a grouped object can be made into an <u>icon</u>
       object or a <u>symbol</u> object through user commands.

       Tgif objects are stored in two types of files.  A file with a <u>.obj</u> extension (referred to  as  an  <u>object</u>
       file)  is  a file of objects, and a file with a <u>.sym</u> extension (referred to as a <u>symbol</u> file) specifies a
       ``building-block'' object.  A <u>teleport</u> mechanism is provided to <u>travel</u>  (or  <u>hyperjump</u>)  among  the  .obj
       files.  A building-block object consists of the <u>representation</u> part and the <u>definition</u> part (which can be
       empty) of the object.  Tgif supports the ``bottom-up'' construction of hierarchical drawings by providing
       the  capability  to  ``instantiate'' a building-block object in a drawing.  Tgif also supports the ``top-
       down'' specification of drawings by allowing the user to make any  object  a  <u>representation</u>  of  an  un-
       specified  subsystem.   Both  types  of files are stored in the form of Prolog facts.  Prolog code can be
       written to interpret the drawings!  (It is left to the user  to  produce  the  code.   See  the  PROLOG/C
       TESTDRIVE  section  for  more  details.)   Prolog  engines  are referred to as <u>drivers</u> in the sections to
       follow.  (Other types of drivers are also allowed, e.g., written in C.)

       Text based <u>attributes</u> can be attached to any non-text object.  Attributes specified in the representation
       part of a building-block object are  non-detachable  when  such  an  object  is  instantiated.   See  the
       ATTRIBUTES section for details.

       Tgif  can generate output in a few different formats.  By default, the output is in the PostScript format
       (color PostScript is supported), and it is generated into a file named /tmp/Tgifa* (produced by  mktemp()
       calls)  where  * is a number; this file is piped to <a href="../man1/lpr.1.html">lpr</a>(1).  This takes place when the laser-printer icon
       is displayed in the Choice Window (see the TGIF SUBWINDOWS section for the naming of tgif windows).  This
       output can be redirected to a file with a <u>.ps</u> extension.  This takes place when the <u>PS</u> icon is  displayed
       in  the Choice Window.  When the <u>PDF</u> icon is displayed in the Choice Window, the output is generated into
       a file with a <u>.pdf</u> extension.  By default, tgif  calls  <a href="../man1/ps2pdf.1.html">ps2pdf</a>(1)  from  the  <a href="../man1/ghostscript.1.html">ghostscript</a>(1)  package  to
       convert  a  <u>PS</u>  file to a <u>PDF</u> file.  When the <u>LaTeX</u> (or <u>EPSI</u>) icon is displayed in the Choice Window, the
       output is generated into a file with a <u>.eps</u> extension.  This file is in the Encapsulated  PostScript  (or
       Encapsulated  PostScript  Interchange)  format; it can be included in a LaTeX document with the <u>\psfig</u> or
       the <u>\epsf</u> construct; this will be discussed later.  The only difference between the EPS and EPSI  formats
       is  that  an EPSI file contains a preview bitmap.  However, it takes time to generate the preview bitmap.
       If the EPS/EPSI file is to be incorporated into some tool that does not  know  how  to  use  the  preview
       bitmap,  time  can  be  saved  by  not using the EPSI format.  When the <u>T</u> icon is displayed in the Choice
       Window, the output is generated into a file with a <u>.txt</u> extension.  This is a text  file  containing  all
       visible  text;  it  can  be fed to a spell checker.  When the <u>x11bm</u> (X11 bitmap) icon is displayed in the
       Choice Window and color output is <u>not</u> selected, tgif generates the output with the  <u>.xbm</u>  extension;  the
       output  is  in  the  X11 bitmap format.  However, if the x11bm icon is displayed in the Choice Window and
       color output <u>is</u> selected (through the ^#k keyboard command -- ^ denotes the &lt;Control&gt; and #  denotes  the
       &lt;Meta&gt;  or  &lt;Alt&gt;  key), then tgif generates the output with the <u>.xpm</u> extension, and the output is in the
       X11 pixmap format (the version of this XPM format depends on the settings of the Tgif.XPmOutputVersion  X
       default).   When the <u>GIF</u> icon is displayed in the Choice Window, the output is generated into a file with
       a <u>.gif</u> extension.  By default, tgif calls xpmtoppm and ppmtogif from the <a href="../man1/netpbm.1.html">netpbm</a>(1) package to convert  an
       <u>XPM</u> file to a <u>GIF</u> file.

       X11  bitmap  files, certain forms of X11 pixmap files (such as the one generated by tgif; see the section
       on X11 PIXMAP for details), GIF files, and Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files can be <u>imported</u> into  tgif
       and  be represented as tgif primitive objects.  Files in other raster formats (e.g, JPEG, TIFF, etc.) can
       also be imported into tgif if external tools can be used to convert them into X11 pixmap  files.   Please
       see the IMPORT RASTER GRAPHICS section for details.

       Tgif  drawings  are  supposed  to  be  printed  on letter size paper (8.5in by 11in).  Both landscape and
       portrait page styles are supported by tgif.  Reduction (or magnification) can be  controlled  by  the  #%
       keyboard  command  to  set  the  reduction/magnification.   If the compiler flag -DA4PAPER is defined (in
       Imakefile or Makefile.noimake), then the output is supposed  to  be  printed  on  A4  papers  (which  has
       approximate dimensions of 8.25in by 11.7in).

</pre><h4><b>GRAPHICAL</b> <b>OBJECTS</b></h4><pre>
       An  object  in  an  <u>object</u> (<u>.obj</u>) file can be a primitive object, a grouped object, or an <u>icon</u> object.  A
       <u>symbol</u> (<u>.sym</u>) file can have any number of objects allowed in  an  object  file  and  exactly  one  <u>symbol</u>
       object.   (Recall  that  a symbol file specifies a building-block object.)  The symbol object in a symbol
       file is the representation part of the building-block object, and the rest of  the  symbol  file  is  the
       definition  part of the building-block object.  The symbol object is highlighted with a dashed outline to
       distinguish it from the rest of the objects.  When a building-block object is  instantiated,  the  symbol
       part  of  the  file  is  copied  into the graphics editor, and it becomes the icon for the building-block
       object.

       All objects in tgif can be moved, duplicated, deleted, rotated, flipped, and sheared.   However,  in  the
       non-stretchable  text  mode,  text  objects can not be stretched.  For an text object, if it has not been
       stretched, rotated, or sheared, flipping it horizontally will cause the text justification to change  and
       flipping it vertically has no effect.

       Tgif supports 32 fill patterns, 32 pen patterns, 7 default line widths, 4 line styles (plain, head arrow,
       tail  arrow,  double  arrows)  for  polylines  and  open-splines,  9  dash  patterns,  3  types  of  text
       justifications, 4 text styles (roman, italic, bold, bold-italic), 11 default text sizes (8, 10,  12,  14,
       18,  and  24  for  the  75dpi fonts and 11, 14, 17, 20, 25, and 34 for the 100dpi fonts), 5 default fonts
       (Times, Courier, Helvetica, New-Century-Schoolbook, Symbol), and 11 default colors (magenta, red,  green,
       blue,  yellow,  pink,  cyan,  cadet-blue,  white, black, dark-slate-gray).  Additional line widths can be
       added through the use of Tgif.MaxLineWidths, Tgif.LineWidth#, Tgif.ArrowWidth#, and  Tgif.ArrowHeight#  X
       defaults.   Additional  text  sizes can be added through the use of Tgif.FontSizes X default.  Additional
       fonts can be added through the use of Tgif.AdditionalFonts X default.  If  the  defaults  fonts  are  not
       available,  their  replacement  fonts  can  be  specified  by Tgif.HasAlternateDefaultFonts and related X
       defaults.  Additional colors can be added through the use of Tgif.MaxColors, and Tgif.Color# X  defaults.
       One  can  also  select  AddColor()  or  ChooseColor() from the Properties Menu to add a color.  Alternate
       startup colors can be  selected  through  the  use  of  the  Tgif.ColorFromXPixmap,  Tgif.UseStdPalette8,
       Tgif.UseStdPalette27,    Tgif.UseStdPalette64,    Tgif.UseStdPalette216,    Tgif.UseMobileWebSafePalette,
       Tgif.UseOpenOfficeGalaxyPalette, Tgif.UseOpenOfficeGooglePalette, and Tgif.AdditionalColors X defaults.

       Most commands in tgif can either be  activated  by  a  popup  menu  or  by  typing  an  appropriate  non-
       alphanumeric key.  All operations that change any object can be undone and then redone.  Commands such as
       zoom,  scroll,  change  fonts  while  no text objects are selected, etc. are not undoable.  The undo/redo
       history buffer size can be set using the Tgif.HistoryDepth X default.

</pre><h4><b>TGIF</b> <b>SUBWINDOWS</b></h4><pre>
       The tgif windows are described in this section.

       <u>Top</u> <u>Window</u>
              Displays the current domain and the name of the file tgif is looking at.   Mouse  clicks  and  key
              presses have no effect.

       <u>Menubar</u> <u>Window</u>
              This  window  is  right  under  the Top Window.  Pull-down menus can be activated from it with any
              mouse buttons.  Key presses have no effect.  If HideMenubar() is selected from  the  Layout  Menu,
              this  window  becomes  invisible.  If ShowMenubar() is selected from the Layout Menu (which can be
              activated from the Canvas Window below), this window becomes visible.

              The View, Text, and Graphics pull-down menus are cascading menus and can not be  <u>pinned</u>  (see  the
              <u>Popup</u> <u>Menus</u> subsection below for a description).

       <u>Message</u> <u>Window</u>
              This  is  right under the Menubar Window and to the right It displays tgif messages.  Clicking the
              left mouse button in this window scrolls the messages towards the bottom, clicking the right mouse
              button scrolls towards the top, and clicking or dragging the middle mouse button  scrolls  to  the
              location  in  the  message  history  depending  on where the mouse is clicked.  If the &lt;Shift&gt; (or
              &lt;Control&gt;) key is held down when clicking the left/right mouse button, it scrolls right/left.

       <u>Panel</u> <u>(Choice)</u> <u>Window</u>
              This is the window to the left of the Message Window, and it contains a collection of  icons  (not
              to  be  confused with the tgif icon objects) reflecting the current state of tgif.  In top/bottom,
              left/right order, it displays the current drawing mode, the page style  (portrait  or  landscape),
              edit  (see  below),  print/export  mode,  zoom  factor,  move  and  stretch  mode  (constrained or
              unconstrained), radius for rounded-corner rectangles, text rotation, page  number  or  row/column,
              page layout mode (stacked or tiled), horizontal alignment (L C R S -), vertical alignment (T M B S
              -),  font,  text  size,  vertical  spacing between lines of text within the same text object, text
              justification, shape (see below), stretchable or non-stretchable text  mode,  dash  pattern,  line
              style, polyline, spline, or interpolated spline, line width, fill pattern, pen pattern, color, and
              special (see below).  Key presses have no effect in this window.

              In  addition  to  displaying the current state of tgif, the icons in the Choice Window can also be
              used to change the current state.  Each icon is associated with a  particular  state  variable  of
              tgif.   Clicking the left mouse button on top of an icon cycles the state variable associated with
              the icon forward; clicking the right mouse button cycles the state variable  backwards.   Dragging
              the  middle  mouse button on top of an icon usually generates a popup menu which corresponds to an
              entry in the Main Menu for the Canvas Window below.  (The ``edit'',  ``shape'',   and  ``special''
              icons mentioned above are dummy icons that allow the ``edit'', ``shape'', and ``special'' menus to
              be  accessed  in  the  Choice  Window.   They do not respond to left and right mouse clicks.)  The
              response to the dragging of the middle mouse  button  is  different  for  the  zoom,  radius,  and
              vertical  spacing icons.  Dragging the mouse left or up increases the zoom or decreases the radius
              or vertical spacing; dragging the mouse right or down has the opposite effect.

              If there are objects selected in the canvas window, then the action of the mouse  will  cause  the
              selected  objects to change to the newly selected mode; note that in this case, the current choice
              won't change if the middle mouse button is used (unless the Tgif.StickyMenuSelection X default  is
              set to true).

              The  settings  of the horizontal and vertical alignments determine how objects (or vertices) align
              with each other when the ^l keyboard command is issued, how each  individual  object  (or  vertex)
              aligns  with  the grids when the ^t keyboard command is issued, how objects or vertices distribute
              spatially with respect to each other when the #l keyboard command is issued,  and  how  each  icon
              replaces the old icon when the ^#u keyboard command is issued.  The horizontal alignments are left
              (L),  center  (C),  right  (R),  space  (S), and ignore (-).  The vertical alignments are top (T),
              middle (M), bottom (B), space (S), and ignore (-).  In aligning operations, the space (S) and  the
              ignore  (-) settings have the same effect.  The space settings are used to distribute objects such
              that the gaps between any two neighboring objects are  equal.   In  vertex  mode,  any  non-ignore
              setting will cause the selected vertices to be spaced out evenly.  The best way to understand them
              is to try them out.

              The  text  vertical  spacing determines the vertical distance to advance when a carriage return is
              pressed during text editing.  If the user tries to set the value too negative, such that the  next
              line is exactly at the same position as the current line, such a setting will not be allowed (this
              distance depends on the current font and font size).

       <u>Canvas</u> <u>Window</u>
              This  is  the drawing area.  The effects of the actions of the mouse are determined by the current
              drawing mode.  Before tgif-4.x, dragging the right mouse button will generate the Mode Menu.  This
              is disabled by default in tgif-4.x, but you can turn it  on  using  the  Tgif.Btn3PopupModeMenu  X
              default.

              The  drawing modes are (in order, as they appear in the Mode Menu) select, text, rectangle, corner
              oval, center oval, edge circle,  polyline  (open-spline),  polygon  (closed-spline),  arc  (center
              first),  arc  (endpoints first), rounded-corner rectangle, freehand polyline (open-spline), select
              vertices, and rotate/shear.  When drawing a rectangle, an oval, or a rounded-corner rectangle,  if
              the  &lt;Shift&gt;  key is held down, a square, a circle, or a rounded-corner square is drawn.  Dragging
              the middle mouse button will generate the Main Menu.

              In the select mode, left mouse button selects, moves, stretches,  and  reshapes  objects  (double-
              click  will ``de-select'' all selected objects in vertex mode).  When an object is selected, it is
              highlighted by little squares (referred as  handles  here)  at  the  corners/vertices  (using  the
              Tgif.HandleSize  X  default,  the  sizes  of  the handles can be customized).  Dragging one of the
              handles stretches/reshapes the selected object.  If one wants  to  move  a  selected  object,  one
              should not drag the handles.  Instead, one should drag other parts of the object.  For example, if
              the  object  is  a hollow rectangle (the fill is NONE and the pen is not NONE), in order to select
              the rectangle, one should click on the outline of the rectangle with the left  mouse  button.   If
              one  would  like to move the rectangle, one should drag the outline of the rectangle with the left
              mouse button.  If the object is a filled rectangle (fill is not NONE), one can  click  inside  the
              rectangle to select it and drag anywhere inside the rectangle to move it.

              Holding  down  the  &lt;Shift&gt;  key  and  clicking the left mouse on an object which is not currently
              selected will add the object to the list of already selected objects.  The same action applied  to
              an object which is already selected will cause it to be de-selected.  When stretching objects (not
              reshaping poly-type objects), holding down the &lt;Shift&gt; key <u>after</u> stretching is initiated activates
              proportional  stretching  (basically,  a  scale operation is being performed).  In non-stretchable
              text mode, text objects can not be stretched or scaled.

              Double-clicking or clicking the middle mouse button while  the  &lt;Shift&gt;  key  is  held  down  will
              activate the <u>teleport</u> (or <u>travel</u>), the <u>launch</u>, or the <u>execute</u> <u>internal</u> <u>command</u> mechanism.  See the
              sections   on   TELEPORT/HYPERJUMP,  LAUNCH  APPLICATIONS,  and  INTERNAL  COMMANDS  for  details.
              Teleporting has precedence over  launching,  which  has  precedence  over  executing  an  internal
              command.  In the text drawing mode, dragging the middle mouse button while the &lt;Cntrl&gt; key is held
              down inside the edit text area will move the edit text area.

              The  arrow  keys  can also be used to move selected objects.  However, if no objects are selected,
              using the arrow keys will scroll the drawing area by a small amount, and using the arrow keys when
              &lt;Control&gt; key is held down will scroll a screen full.

              In the select vertices mode, left mouse button selects and moves  vertices.   Only  the  top-level
              polyline/open-spline  and polygon/closed-spline objects which are selected when the vertex mode is
              activated are eligible for vertex operations.  In this  mode,  all  eligible  objects  have  their
              vertices  highlighted  with  squares.   When  a  vertex  is  selected  (using similar mechanism as
              selecting objects described above),  it  is  doubly  highlighted  with  a  '+'  sign.   Operations
              available  to  these  doubly  highlighted  vertices  are  move,  delete,  align (with each other),
              distribute (space them equally), and align to grid.  The arrow keys  can  also  be  used  to  move
              selected vertices.

              Objects  can  be  locked  (through  the  #&lt;  keyboard command).  Locked object are shown with gray
              handles, and they can not be moved, stretched, flipped, rotated, or  sheared.   When  objects  are
              grouped,  the  resulting  grouped  object  will  also be locked if any one of it's constituents is
              locked.  Locked objects can have their properties,  such  as  color,  font,  pen,  etc.,  changed;
              furthermore, they can be deleted.

              If  the  current move/stretch mode is of the constrained type (activated and deactivated by the #@
              keyboard command), top-level polylines will have the following behavior.  In a move operation,  if
              both endpoints of a polyline lie inside the objects being moved, then the whole polyline is moved;
              otherwise, if only one endpoint falls inside the objects being moved, then that endpoint is moved.
              The  vertex  that  is  the neighbor of the moved endpoint may also be moved either horizontally or
              vertically.  If the last line segment is horizontal or vertical, then the neighbor vertex  may  be
              moved  so  that  the direction of the last line segment is maintained.  In a stretch (not reshape)
              operation, if an endpoint of a polyline lies inside the objects being moved, that endpoint will be
              moved.  The vertex that is the neighbor of the moved endpoint will  also  be  moved  in  the  same
              manner as described above.

              When  the  drawing  mode  is set to text (a vertical-bar cursor is shown), clicking the left mouse
              button causes selected text to go into edit mode.  Dragging the left mouse button or clicking  the
              left  mouse  button while the &lt;Shift&gt; key is held down highlights substrings of the text.  Double-
              clicking causes a word to be selected.  In edit mode, key presses  are  treated  as  text  strings
              being  inputed,  and  arrow  keys  are used to move the current input position.  If a key press is
              preceded by an &lt;ESC&gt; key, then the  character's  bit  7  is  turned  on.   This  allows  non-ASCII
              (international)  characters  to  be  entered.   One  can  use <a href="../man1/xfd.1.html">xfd</a>(1) to see what the corresponding
              international character is for an ASCII character.  For the  Symbol  font,  symbols  such  as  the
              integral,  partial  derivative,  and  copyright symbols can all be found in this range.  There are
              some characters that are supported by X11 but not by PostScript; these characters are not accepted
              by tgif.  If the text being edited is an attribute of a object, &lt;Meta&gt;&lt;Tab&gt; will move  the  cursor
              to  the  next  visible  attribute  and  &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Tab&gt;  will move the cursor to the previous visible
              attribute.

              If the drawing mode is set to draw polygons (not closed-splines) and if the &lt;Shift&gt;  key  is  held
              down, the rubber-banded polygon will be self-closing.

              The freehand drawing mode can be used to draw polylines and open splines.  All intermediate points
              are  specified  by  moving  the mouse (as opposed to clicking the mouse buttons as in the polyline
              mode).  The second endpoint is specified by releasing the mouse button.

              In all drawing modes (other than the text mode),  pressing  the  &lt;ESC&gt;  key  cancels  the  drawing
              (creation) of the current object.

              Middle  mouse  button always generates the main tgif popup menu.  Holding down the &lt;Shift&gt; key and
              clicking the right mouse button will change the drawing mode to  <u>select</u>.   Key  presses  with  the
              &lt;Control&gt; or &lt;Meta&gt; key held down (referred to as <u>non-alphanumeric</u> key presses since they can also
              generate  control  characters)  are  treated as commands, and their bindings are summarized in the
              next section.  Users can also define single key commands to emulate  the  functions  of  the  non-
              alphanumeric key commands.  The SHORTCUTS section will describe the details.

       <u>Scrollbars</u>
              Clicking  the  left  mouse button in the vertical/horizontal scrollbar causes the canvas window to
              scroll down/right by a small distance; clicking the right mouse button  has  the  reverse  effect.
              (The  scrollbars in the popup windows for selecting file names and domain names behave similarly.)
              Clicking with the &lt;Shift&gt; key held down will scroll a  window  full.   Clicking  or  dragging  the
              middle  button will cause the page to scroll to the location which corresponds to the gray area in
              the scrollbars.  (Tgif insists that the left-top corner of the Canvas Window is at a distance that
              is a nonnegative multiple of some internal units from the left-top corner of the actual page.)

       <u>Rulers</u>
              They track the mouse location.  Mouse clicks and key  presses  have  no  effect.   When  the  page
              reduction/magnification  is set at 100%, the markings in the rulers correspond to centimeters when
              the metric grid system is used, and they correspond to inches when  the  English  grid  system  is
              used.  When the page reduction/magnification is not set at 100%, the markings do not correspond to
              the above mentioned units any more (this is considered as a known bug).

       <u>Interrupt/Hyperspace</u> <u>Window</u>
              This  window  is right below the Message Window and to the left of the horizontal ruler.  When the
              Tgif.IntrCheckInterval X default has a positive value, an  interrupt  icon  is  visible  when  the
              Canvas  Window  is  being  redrawn.   If the user clicks on this window when the interrupt icon is
              visible, tgif aborts the repainting of the objects.  If this is done when a file is  being  opened
              (either  through Open() or Push()), the drawing of objects is stopped, but the reading of the file
              continues (reading of the file is not aborted).

              If tgif is currently in the <u>hyperspace</u> mode (please see the  HYPERSPACE  section  below  for  more
              details),  a  space  ship  icon  will be displayed when the interrupt icon is not being displayed.
              Clicking any button in this window will switch tgif in and out of the hyperspace mode.

       <u>Page</u> <u>Control</u> <u>Window</u>
              The Page Control Window is to the left of the horizontal scrollbar.  This window is empty  if  the
              current  page  mode is set to the <u>tiled</u> page mode.  If the current page mode is set to the <u>stacked</u>
              page mode, each page has a tab in tabs subwindow of this window.  Clicking the left  mouse  button
              on  a  tab  goes  to  the corresponding page.  Clicking the middle mouse button brings up the Page
              Menu.  When there are too many pages in a drawing so that one can not see the  tabs  for  all  the
              pages,  one  can  use  the  icons  to  the left side of the Page Control Window to scroll the tabs
              subwindow.  Clicking on the first icon scrolls the tabs subwindow  such  that  the  first  tab  is
              visible.   Clicking  on the 4th icon scrolls the tabs subwindow such that the last tab is visible.
              Clicking on the 2nd icon scrolls the tabs subwindow towards the first tab by one tab and  clicking
              on the 3rd icon scrolls the tabs subwindow towards the last tab by one tab.

       <u>Status</u> <u>Window</u>
              This  window  is  below  the  horizontal scrollbar.  It shows what action will be taken if a mouse
              button is depressed.  When a menu is pulled down or popped up, this window shows what action  will
              be  taken  if  a menu item is selected.  It also displays miscellaneous status information.  Mouse
              clicks and key presses have no effect.  If HideStatus() is selected from  the  Layout  Menu,  this
              window  becomes  invisible.  If ShowStatus() is selected from the Layout Menu, this window becomes
              visible.

              By default, when this window is displaying mouse button status,  right-handed  mouse  is  assumed.
              Setting  the  Tgif.ReverseMouseStatusButtons  X  default  to true will reverse the status (as if a
              left-handed mouse is used).

       <u>Popup</u> <u>Menus</u>
              When a menu is popped up by a mouse drag, the menu can be <u>pinned</u>  if  it  is  dragged  far  enough
              horizontally  (the  distance  is  determined  by  the  setting  of  the Tgif.MainMenuPinDistance X
              default).  Clicking the right mouse button in a pinned menu will cause it to disappear.   Dragging
              the   left   mouse   button   in  a  pinned  menu  will  reposition  the  menu  (except  when  the
              Tgif.TitledPinnedMenu X default is set to true in which case the left mouse  button  performs  the
              same  function  as the middle mouse button).  Clicking the middle mouse button in it will activate
              the item right below the mouse.

</pre><h4><b>NON-ALPHANUMERIC</b> <b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Most operations that can be performed in tgif  can  be  activated  through  non-alphanumeric  keys  (some
       operations  can  only  be  activated  through popup menus or shortcut keys).  This section summarizes the
       operations that can be activated by a key stroke with the &lt;Control&gt; and/or  the  &lt;Meta&gt;  key  held  down.
       ``^''  denotes  the  &lt;Control&gt;  key  and ``#'' denotes the &lt;Meta&gt; key in the following description.  (The
       ``<u>keys.obj</u>'' file, distributed with tgif, also summarizes the  same  information,  but  it  is  organized
       differently.   This  file can be viewed with tgif, and if installed properly, it can be found in the same
       directory as the ``tgificon.obj'' file, mentioned in the FILES section of this document.)

</pre><h4><b>SHORTCUTS</b></h4><pre>
       The user can define single character <u>shortcut</u> keys to emulate the function of  the  non-alphanumeric  key
       presses  to  activate  commands.   This is done through the use of the Tgif.ShortCuts X default.  (Please
       note that these shortcut keys are only active when the drawing mode is <u>not</u> set to the  text  mode.)   The
       Tgif.ShortCuts  consists  of  a list of items, each of which specifies the bindings between a key (may be
       case sensitive) and a command.  The items are separated by  blanks,  and  each  item  is  interpreted  as
       follows.   It  consists  of  two  parts,  KEY  and  COMMAND,  which  are concatenated together with a ':'
       character.  The format of the KEY part is one of <u>:&lt;Key&gt;x</u>, <u>!&lt;Key&gt;x</u>, or <u>&lt;Key&gt;x</u> (here the character  'x'  is
       used  as  an  example; furthermore, the substring <u>&lt;Key&gt;</u> must be spelled exactly the way it appears here).
       The first 2 formats are equivalent, they specify the <u>lower</u> <u>case</u> x; the  3rd  format  specifies  both  the
       characters  'x'  and  'X'.   The COMMAND part is a string that matches strings in tgif's popup menus with
       space characters removed (exceptions are noted below).  This is illustrated by the following example.  In
       the Edit menu, two of the entries are,

          "Delete   ^x"
          "SelectAll     ^a"

       which means that &lt;Control&gt;x activates and Delete() command,  and  &lt;Control&gt;a  activates  the  SelectAll()
       command.   Therefore,  both  Delete()  and SelectAll() are valid names for the COMMAND part of a shortcut
       specification.  To complete the example, the following line can be used to bind the  lower  case  'x'  to
       Delete() and 'a' or 'A' to SelectAll():

          Tgif.ShortCuts:     !&lt;Key&gt;x:Delete() \n\
                         &lt;Key&gt;a:SelectAll()

       For  more  examples,  please  see  the  sample  X  defaults  file,  tgif.Xdefaults,  included in the tgif
       distribution.

       Here is a list of exceptions where the COMMAND does not match a command name in a menu entry.   The  left
       entry  is a proper COMMAND name, and the right is a list of strings that's shown in popup menus which the
       COMMAND would correspond to.

          CyclePrintFormat()  Printer,  LaTeXFig,  RawPSFile,  XBitmap,  TextFile,  EPSI,  GIF/ISMAP,  TiffEPSI,
       NetList

          CenterAnEndPoint()  (move an endpoint of a polyline object to the center of another object)
          ToggleNamedAttrShown(&lt;x&gt;=)    (toggle name shown for the attribute &lt;x&gt;)
          ToggleSmoothHinge() (convert smooth to hinge and hinge to smooth points)

          ToggleShowMode()    ShowMode, HideMode
          ToggleOneMotionSelMove() OneMotionSelMove, ClickSelClickMove
          ToggleHyperSpace()  GoHyperSpace, LeaveHyperSpace
          ImportOtherFileType(&lt;x&gt;) (import using a filter named &lt;x&gt;)
          BrowseOtherType(&lt;x&gt;)     (browse using a filter named &lt;x&gt;)
          PrintSelectedObjs() (print selected objects)

       In  addition  to the above list, the following are also valid COMMAND names (having the obvious meaning):
       ScrollLeft(), ScrollRight(), ScrollUp(), ScrollDown(), SelectMode(), DrawText(),  DrawBox(),  DrawOval(),
       DrawPoly(), DrawPolygon(), DrawRCBox(), DrawArc(), and SelectVertexMode().

</pre><h4><b>COLORS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>COLORMAPS</b></h4><pre>
       In  most  X  environments,  only  256  colors  can  be  displayed  at  once.  In these environment, if an
       application needs 128 colors  and  another  application  needs  a  totally  different  129  colors,  both
       applications  can  not  be  displayed  at  once  with  all the colors they want.  X solves the problem by
       allowing applications to use their own colormaps (known as private colormaps).  Each private colormap can
       have at most 256 colors.  There is also a shared colormap available for applications that do not wish  to
       use  private  colormaps.   The  main problem with using private colormaps is that a user will see the the
       well-known <u>colormap</u> <u>flashing</u> phenomenon when he/she switches in and out of applications that use  private
       colormaps.

       Tgif  uses  the shared colormap initially.  When it needs more color than what is available in the shared
       colormap, it will use a private colormap automatically.  When tgif no longer needs the extra  colors,  it
       does <u>not</u> automatically revert to using the shared colormap because it needs to be able to undo operations
       that  use  the  extra colors.  If one does no longer needs the objects in the undo buffer, one can select
       FlushUndoBuffer() from the Edit Menu to flush the undo buffer.  At this point, tgif will attempt  to  use
       the  shared  colormap to avoid the colormap flashing problem.  If one often uses XPM and GIF objects, one
       can bind the &lt;Shift&gt;f key to the FlushUndoBuffer() operation by setting the following X default and  uses
       the &lt;Shift&gt;f key to regain entries in the colormap when an XPM/GIF object is deleted:

              Tgif.ShortCuts: !&lt;Key&gt;F:FlushUndoBuffer()

       Even when a private colormap is used, only 256 colors can be used at once.  Therefore, it is not possible
       to  import two 256-colors GIF files into the same drawing unless the colors are somehow reduced to fit in
       the 256-colors colormap.  This can be done through <u>dithering</u> which is  described  in  the  IMPORT  RASTER
       GRAPHICS section below.

</pre><h4><b>IMPORT</b> <b>RASTER</b> <b>GRAPHICS</b></h4><pre>
       The  native  raster  graphics formats that tgif supports are the XBM and XPM formats.  In order to import
       color raster graphics file of another format, tgif can work with external tools that can convert  non-XPM
       format  files  to an XPM files.  A popular raster format conversion toolkit is the <u><a href="../man1/pbmplus.1.html">pbmplus</a></u>(1) (also known
       as the <u><a href="../man1/netpbm.1.html">netpbm</a></u>(1)) toolkit.  It can convert a GIF file (e.g., "foo.gif") to an XPM file (e.g.,  "foo.xpm")
       with  the  following  command  (<u>giftopnm</u> is in netpbm; an earlier version of it called <u>giftoppm</u> exists in
       pbmplus):

              giftopnm foo.gif | ppmtoxpm &gt; foo.xpm

       When working with tgif, a GIF file name will be supplied by tgif and  the  output  of  ppmtoxpm  will  be
       directly  read  by  tgif  through  a  pipe;  therefore, the previous sequence is replaced by an X default
       containing the following form (which happens to be the default setting for the Tgif.GifToXpm X default):

              giftopnm %s | ppmtoxpm

       The "%s" is to be replaced by a GIF file name.  The above is referred to as a <u>filter</u>.

       To be able to import other types  of  raster  graphics  files,  one  can  use  Tgif.MaxImportFilters  and
       Tgif.ImportFilter# X defaults to specify additional filters.  The following example adds a JPEG filter:

              Tgif.MaxImportFilters: 1
              Tgif.ImportFilter0: \n\
                      JPEG-222 jpg;jpeg \n\
                      djpeg -gif -colors 222 %s | \n\
                      giftopnm | ppmtoxpm

       The  "JPEG-222"  above  is  the  name  given  to  the filter (must not contain any space character).  The
       "jpg;jpeg" are possible file extensions separated by semicolons.  The rest is the  filter  specification.
       The <a href="../man1/djpeg.1.html">djpeg</a>(1) program is part of the libjpeg distribution.  It can convert a JPEG file to a GIF file.  The
       above  filter  also restrict the output to have a maximum of 222 colors.  (The 222 is chosen arbitrarily.
       Many XPM files use some ``standard'' 32 colors, so one may want to leave room form them.)

       To invoke a filter, one can select ImportOtherFile() or BrowseOther() commands from the File Menu.   This
       will  bring  up  a  dialogbox  listing  the  available  filters by their names (e.g., "JPEG-222").  After
       selecting  a  filter,  tgif  continues  in  a  similar  manner  as  with  invoking   ImportXPixmap()   or
       BrowseXPixmap() commands from the File Menu.

       The  above example is not suitable for the BrowseOther() command because only 256 colors can be used in a
       drawing (as explained in the COLORS AND COLORMAPS section above).  In order  for  BrowseOther()  to  work
       well,  one can use <u>dithering</u> to represent an image with a <u>dithered</u> image that only uses a set of standard
       colors.  The example below uses ppmdither from the pbmplus/netpbm toolkit:

              Tgif.MaxImportFilters: 2
              Tgif.ImportFilter0: \n\
                      JPEG-222 jpg;jpeg \n\
                      djpeg -gif -colors 222 %s | \n\
                      giftopnm | ppmtoxpm
              Tgif.ImportFilter1: \n\
                      JPEG-dithered jpg;jpeg \n\
                      djpeg -gif %s | \n\
                      giftopnm | ppmdither | ppmtoxpm

       If one is working with one JPEG image, one can select ImportOtherFile() then select "JPEG-222" to get  as
       many  as 222 colors.  If one is browsing for JPEG images, one can select BrowseOther() then select "JPEG-
       dithered".

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       If an object contains an attribute (please see the ATTRIBUTES sections below for details) whose  name  is
       the string <u>"name"</u> (case-sensitive), the value part of the attribute is the <u>name</u> of the object.  Subobject
       of a composite object can be named using a <u>path</u>, e.g., <u>&lt;t&gt;!&lt;s1&gt;!&lt;s2&gt;!...</u>, where <u>&lt;t&gt;</u> is the name of a top-
       level  object which directly contains <u>&lt;s1&gt;</u> which directly contains <u>&lt;s2&gt;</u>, etc.  <u>!*</u> refers to the currently
       selected object (if more than one object is selected, the top-most object in the stacking order is used).
       <u>!*&lt;s1&gt;!&lt;s2&gt;</u> names the <u>&lt;s2&gt;</u> subobject of the <u>&lt;s1&gt;</u> subobject of the currently selected object.

       The following is <u>not</u> <u>fully</u> supported, yet (only the <u>#&lt;page&gt;</u> form  is  supported  at  this  time).   Every
       object  in  a  tgif  file  can be uniquely named using the notation <u>#&lt;page&gt;!&lt;path&gt;</u>, where <u>&lt;page&gt;</u> can be a
       string that specifies the name of a page or <u>#&lt;number&gt;</u> which specifies  a  page  number.   The  <u>&lt;path&gt;</u>  is
       described  in the previous paragraph.  If an object <u>o1</u> is referenced by another object <u>o2</u> within the same
       file (no file name or URL is specified before <u>#</u>) and <u>&lt;page&gt;</u> is omitted, then <u>o1</u> must be on the same  page
       as  <u>o2</u>.   If a file name or URL is specified before <u>#</u> and <u>&lt;page&gt;</u> is omitted, then <u>o1</u> must be on the first
       page.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       Attributes are text strings of the form <u>name=value</u> or <u>value</u> which are  attached  to  either  the  current
       drawing  or  any  non-text  objects.   An  attribute  attached  to  the  current drawing is called a <u>file</u>
       <u>attribute</u>; otherwise, it is a <u>regular</u> <u>attribute</u>.  Attributes can be  attached  and  detached  from  these
       objects except in the following case:

              Attributes appearing in the symbol object in a building-block object file can not be detached when
              the   building-block   object  is  instantiated.   These  attributes  are  considered  to  be  the
              ``inherited'' attributes of the icon object.  (If it  is  really  necessary  to  detach  inherited
              attributes  of  an icon object, the icon object can be ``de-iconified'' by using UnMakeIconic() in
              the Special Menu to make it a grouped object; then the attributes can be detached.)

       A file attribute is always invisible.  For a regular attribute, the user has control over which  part  of
       the  attribute  is  displayed.   An  entire attribute can be made invisible, or only its name can be made
       invisible (accomplished through the commands under the special menu, such as #m, #n, #j, #-, and ^#h).

</pre><h4><b>TELEPORT/HYPERJUMP</b></h4><pre>
       Tgif provides the mechanism to travel between .obj and .sym files.  If the middle mouse button is clicked
       on an object with the &lt;Shift&gt; key held down (or double-clicking  such  an  object),  tgif  looks  for  an
       attribute  named  <u>warp_to</u>  (by  default) or <u>href</u> of that object.  The only difference between <u>warp_to</u> and
       <u>href</u> is that ".obj" is automatically appended to the value of a <u>warp_to</u> attribute while the  value  of  a
       <u>href</u> attribute is taken as is.  (Please note that <u>warp_to</u> is obsolete now.  It is still supported for the
       sake of compatibility.)  If such an attribute is found, the value part of the attribute is interpreted as
       the  name  of a .obj file to <u>travel</u> to.  (If tgif is in the <u>hyperspace</u> mode, then clicking the left mouse
       button has the same effect.)  If there are multiple <u>href</u> attributes on the object, but are  in  different
       colors,  tgif  will  use  the  one  that  has the same color as the current color appearing in the Choice
       Window.  If the current file is modified, the user is prompted to save the file before traveling  to  the
       next  file.   If the value part of the <u>href</u> attribute starts with the '/' character, the value is treated
       as an absolute file name; otherwise, it is treated as a relative file name.

</pre><h4><b>HYPERSPACE</b></h4><pre>
       Tgif provides a <u>hyperspace</u> mode to facilitate traveling between  .obj  files.   The  hyperspace  mode  is
       entered  when  GoHyperSpace()  is selected from the Navigate Menu.  In hyperspace mode, the little window
       below the Message Window will show a little space  ship.   The  hyperspace  mode  is  also  automatically
       entered when a remote URL is opened (unless the Tgif.AutoHyperSpaceOnRemote X default is set to false).

       In  the  hyperspace  mode, certain objects are considered <u>hot-links</u>.  When the cursor is placed on top of
       these object, it will change from a pointer to a hand to indicate that clicking on the left mouse  button
       will  invoke  some  actions.  An object is a hot-link if it contains an attribute described in either the
       TELEPORT/HYPERJUMP, LAUNCH APPLICATIONS, or INTERNAL COMMANDS section.

       The hyperspace mode is exited when the drawing mode is changed or the LeaveHyperSpace() is selected  from
       the Navigate Menu.

</pre><h4><b>LAUNCH</b> <b>APPLICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Tgif  provides  the mechanism to launch applications.  If the middle mouse button is clicked on an object
       with the &lt;Shift&gt; key held down (or double-clicking such an object), tgif looks  for  an  attribute  named
       <u>launch</u>  (by  default)  of that object.  If such an attribute is found, the value part of the attribute is
       interpreted  as  a  <a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a>(1)  command  to  execute.   Same  color  rule  applies   as   described   in   the
       TELEPORT/HYPERJUMP  section  above.   If the command ends with the '&amp;' character, tgif forks itself (what
       actual happens depends on whether the _BACKGROUND_DONT_FORK compiler flag is defined or  not  at  compile
       time) and the command is executed by the child process; otherwise, popen() is used to execute the command
       (in this case, if the command hangs, there is no way provided to terminate the command, and tgif will not
       be  able  to  recover from it).  Within the command, values of other attributes of the same object can be
       used.  The syntax is:  <u>$(attr)</u>, where <u>attr</u> is the name of another attribute.

       For example, if one wants to perform a <a href="../man1/man.1.html">man</a>(1) function, one  can  draw  a  box;  enter  a  line  of  text
       "title=tgif";  enter  another  line  of text "launch=xterm -rw -e man $(title)"; select all three objects
       using ^a keyboard command; attach the text strings to the box using #a keyboard command; and  launch  the
       <a href="../man1/man.1.html">man</a>(1)  command by clicking the middle mouse button on the box (or the text strings) with the &lt;Shift&gt; key
       held down.  If one wants to be more fancy, the box can be replaced by an X11 pixmap object; the  'launch'
       attribute  can  be  made  invisible;  and the 'title' attribute can be center justified and with its name
       hidden using the #m keyboard command.

       By default, launching of an application is disabled in the <u>hyperspace</u> mode  for  security  considerations
       (this  can  be  overridden by the Tgif.AllowLaunchInHyperSpace X default setting).  If a lunch command is
       encountered in the <u>hyperspace</u> mode, the command is displayed and the user is prompted to  see  if  he/she
       wants to execute the command.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Tgif  provides  the  mechanism to execute internal commands.  If the middle mouse button is clicked on an
       object with the &lt;Shift&gt; key held down (or double-clicking such an object), tgif looks  for  an  attribute
       named  <u>exec</u>  (by default) of that object.  If such an attribute is found, the value part of the attribute
       is interpreted as a list of internal commands (separated by  semicolon)  to  execute.   Same  color  rule
       applies as described in the TELEPORT/HYPERJUMP section above.  A command usually takes the form:

              &lt;cmd_name&gt; ( &lt;arg1&gt;, &lt;arg2&gt;, ..., &lt;argN&gt; )

       An  argument  of  a  command  can  be a string argument or a numeric argument.  A string argument must be
       enclosed in double-quotes.  A numeric argument can be a numerical value or a string of the  form  "$(<u>x</u>)",
       where  <u>x</u>  is  the  name  of another attribute (this form is referred as the substitution form).  A string
       argument can also contain substitution form.  Please note that only one-level substitution are  performed
       (the  collection  of  internal  commands  should  be  viewed  as  a  simple  scripting language and <u>not</u> a
       declaration language).

       When an attribute is referenced in  an  internal  command,  the  attribute  name  can  be  in  the  form,
       <u>&lt;obj_name&gt;.&lt;string&gt;</u>, where <u>&lt;obj_name&gt;</u> must be in the form specified in the OBJECT NAMES section above and
       <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>  contains  only  alphanumeric  characters  and  the  underscore ('_') character.  If the first 2
       characters of an attribute name is "!.", the rest of the attribute name names a file attribute.   If  the
       first 2 characters of an attribute name is "!*", the rest of the attribute name names an attribute of the
       currently selected object (if more than one object is selected, the top-most object in the stacking order
       is used).

       Please note that lines that begin with "//" are treated as comments.

       The following internal commands are supported:

       <u>launch(&lt;attr_name&gt;)</u>
              The  value of the attribute specified by &lt;attr_name&gt; is interpreted as a <a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a>(1) command to execute.
              Please see the LAUNCH APPLICATIONS section above for more details.

       <u>exec(&lt;attr_name&gt;)</u>
              The value of the attribute specified by &lt;attr_name&gt; is  interpreted  as  an  internal  command  to
              execute.  This is similar to a subroutine call.  Please note that the internal command is executed
              in the context of the top-level which contain the attribute.

       <u>mktemp(&lt;str&gt;,&lt;attr_name&gt;)</u>
              This  command  makes  a  unique  file  name.   The  &lt;str&gt;  argument  is  a  template string, e.g.,
              "/tmp/TgifXXXXXX", and it requires at least two "/" in it.  The result of mktemp()  is  stored  as
              the  value  of  the attribute specified by &lt;attr_name&gt;.  Please see the man pages of the C library
              function on <a href="../man3C/mktemp.3C.html">mktemp</a>(3C) for more details.  (If tgif is compiled with  the  -D_USE_TMPFILE  compiler
              option, then <a href="../man3S/tempnam.3S.html">tempnam</a>(3S) is used instead.)

       <u>create_file_using_simple_template(&lt;template&gt;,&lt;output&gt;,&lt;str&gt;,&lt;attr_name&gt;)</u>
              The  file  specified  by &lt;template&gt; is scanned for a line that matches &lt;str&gt;.  When such a line is
              found, that line is replaced by the value of the attribute specified by &lt;attr_name&gt;.   The  result
              is put into the file specified as &lt;output&gt;.

       <u>update_eps_child(&lt;eps_file_name&gt;)</u>
              This only works if the object being executed is a composite object.  If the object has a component
              which  is  an  imported  EPS  (Encapsulated  PostScript)  object,  it  is replaced by the EPS file
              specified by &lt;eps_file_name&gt;.  If the object does not contain an EPS subobject, an  EPS  subobject
              is created.

       <u>update_xbm_child(&lt;xbm_file_name&gt;)</u>
              This only works if the object being executed is a composite object.  If the object has a component
              which  is  an  imported  XBM  (X11  bitmap)  object,  it  is replaced by the XBM file specified by
              &lt;xbm_file_name&gt;.  If the object does not contain an XBM subobject, an XBM subobject is created.

       <u>update_xpm_child(&lt;xpm_file_name&gt;)</u>
              This only works if the object being executed is a composite object.  If the object has a component
              which is an imported XPM (X11 pixmap) object,  it  is  replaced  by  the  XPM  file  specified  by
              &lt;xpm_file_name&gt;.  If the object does not contain an XPM subobject, an XPM subobject is created.

       <u>delete_eps_child(&lt;obj_name&gt;)</u>
              This  only  works  if  the  object  named  &lt;obj_name&gt;  is a composite object.  If the object has a
              component which is an EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) object, it is deleted.  If the object does not
              contain an EPS subobject, no operation is performed.

       <u>delete_xpm_child(&lt;obj_name&gt;)</u>
              This only works if the object named &lt;obj_name&gt; is  a  composite  object.   If  the  object  has  a
              component  which  is an XPM (X11 pixmap) object, it is deleted.  If the object does not contain an
              XPM subobject, no operation is performed.

       <u>delete_xbm_child(&lt;obj_name&gt;)</u>
              This only works if the object named &lt;obj_name&gt; is  a  composite  object.   If  the  object  has  a
              component  which  is an XBM (X11 bitmap) object, it is deleted.  If the object does not contain an
              XBM subobject, no operation is performed.

       <u>flip_deck(&lt;times&gt;,&lt;frames_per_second&gt;,&lt;style&gt;)</u>
              This only works if the object being executed is a composite  object  and  all  subobjects  of  the
              composite object are X11 bitmap or X11 pixmap objects and have identical positions and sizes.  The
              &lt;times&gt;  argument  specifies  the  number of times the deck is flipped.  It can be a number or the
              string "infinite".  The &lt;frames_per_second&gt; argument must be a  number  between  1  and  60.   The
              &lt;style&gt;  argument can be either "linear" or "ping_pong".  When this command is being executed, any
              mouse button click or key click aborts command execution.

       <u>read_file_into_attr(&lt;file_name&gt;,&lt;attr_name&gt;)</u>
              This command reads a file into an  attribute.   The  &lt;file_name&gt;  argument  names  a  file,  e.g.,
              "/tmp/foo".   The  content  of  the  file  is  read  as  the  value  of the attribute specified by
              &lt;attr_name&gt;.  If the file can not be opened for read, the attribute's value is  set  to  an  empty
              string.

       <u>write_attr_into_file(&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;file_name&gt;)</u>
              This command writes the value of an attribute into a file.  The &lt;file_name&gt; argument names a file,
              e.g.,  "/tmp/foo".   The  value  of  the  attribute  specified  by  &lt;attr_name&gt;  is  written  into
              &lt;file_name&gt;.

       <u>append_attr_into_file(&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;file_name&gt;)</u>
              This command appends the value of an attribute into a file.   The  &lt;file_name&gt;  argument  names  a
              file,  e.g.,  "/tmp/foo".   The  value  of the attribute specified by &lt;attr_name&gt; is appended into
              &lt;file_name&gt;.

       <u>select_obj_by_name(&lt;obj_name&gt;)</u>
              This command silently (no highlighting handles) selects an object named  &lt;obj_name&gt;.   Please  see
              the OBJECT NAMES section above for the specification of object names.

       <u>select_top_obj()</u>
              This  command  silently  (no  highlighting handles) selects the top object.  This command fails if
              there is no object in the current page.

       <u>delete_selected_obj()</u>
              This command deletes all selected objects.  This command fails if no object is selected.

       <u>unselect_all_obj()</u>
              This command de-selects all selected objects.  If the select_obj_by_name() command is  used,  this
              command must be used eventually.

       <u>move_selected_obj_relative(&lt;dx&gt;,&lt;dy&gt;)</u>
              This command moves the selected object by &lt;dx&gt; absolute units in the x direction and &lt;dy&gt; absolute
              units in the y direction.

       <u>repeat(&lt;cmd_attr_name&gt;,&lt;times&gt;)</u>
              This command executes the internal command in the &lt;cmd_attr_name&gt; attribute &lt;times&gt; times.

       <u>hyperjump(&lt;attr_name&gt;)</u>
              This command teleports to the file name or URL name found in the &lt;attr_name&gt; attribute.

       <u>make_cgi_query(&lt;dest_attr_name&gt;,&lt;url_name&gt;,&lt;list_attr_name&gt;)</u>
              This   command   constructs   an  URL  in  the  Common  Gateway  Interface  (CGI)  format  in  the
              &lt;dest_attr_name&gt; attribute.  &lt;url_name&gt; names the CGI server script and &lt;list_attr_name&gt; names  an
              attribute  whose  value  are  comma-separated  attribute names.  For example, if an object has the
              following attributes:

                     attr_list=last_name,first_name
                     last_name=Cheng
                     first_name=Bill
                     final_url=
                     exec=make_cgi_query(final_url,
                         <a href="http://bourbon.usc.edu">http://bourbon.usc.edu</a>:8001/cgi-bin/test-cgi,
                         attr_list)

              Executing this object will construct the following string in final_url:

                     <a href="http://bourbon.usc.edu">http://bourbon.usc.edu</a>:8001/cgi-bin/test-cgi?last_name=Cheng&amp;first_name=Bill

              An subsequent hyperjump(final_url) command can be invoked to execute the corresponding  "test-cgi"
              CGI server script with the last_name and first_name arguments.

              For a detailed description of CGI scripts, the reader is referred to [2].

       <u>wait_click(&lt;cursor_name&gt;,&lt;grab&gt;,&lt;attr_name&gt;)</u>
              This command displays the &lt;cursor_name&gt; cursor and waits for the user to click a mouse button.  If
              &lt;cursor_name&gt;  is  the  string  <u>NULL</u>  (case-sensitive),  the cursor will not change.  If &lt;Btn1&gt; is
              clicked, the command terminates and 1 is placed in &lt;attr_name&gt;.  If &lt;Btn2&gt; is clicked, 2 is placed
              in &lt;attr_name&gt;, etc.  If &lt;grab&gt; set to <u>TRUE</u> (case-sensitive), then the mouse is grabbed  by  tgif.
              Valid &lt;cursor_name&gt; can be found in &lt;X11/cursorfont.h&gt; (without the XC_ prefix).

       <u>sleep(&lt;cursor_name&gt;,&lt;ms_interval&gt;)</u>
              This command displays the &lt;cursor_name&gt; cursor and waits for &lt;ms_interval&gt; milliseconds to elapse.
              If  &lt;cursor_name&gt;  is  the string <u>NULL</u> (case-sensitive), the cursor will not change.  This command
              can be interrupted (and aborted) by any mouse clicks or key strokes.  Valid &lt;cursor_name&gt;  can  be
              found in &lt;X11/cursorfont.h&gt; (without the XC_ prefix).

       <u>begin_animate()</u>
              This  command  is used to start an animation sequence (using double-buffering).  Please note that,
              by default, tgif prepares for undo/redo.  For a long animation sequence, the undo/redo records may
              take up a lot of memory.  In this case, disable_undo() (described below)  should  be  used  before
              this command.

       <u>end_animate()</u>
              This command is used to terminate an animation sequence.

       <u>set_redraw(&lt;true_or_false&gt;)</u>
              This  command  is  used to temporarily disable redraw if &lt;true_or_false&gt; is <u>FALSE</u> (case-sensitive)
              when tgif is in the <u>animation</u> mode (turned on by begin_animate()).  If a shuffle_obj_to_top() or a
              shuffle_obj_to_bottom()  command  is  used  before   a   move   command,   set_redraw(FALSE)   and
              set_redraw(TRUE)  should  be  used  immediately  before  and  immediately after, respectively, the
              shuffle_obj_to_top() or shuffle_obj_to_bottom() command.

       <u>set_selected_obj_color(&lt;color_str&gt;)</u>
              This command changes the color of the selected object to &lt;color_str&gt;.  If no object  is  selected,
              the current color will be changed to &lt;color_str&gt;.

       <u>set_selected_obj_fill(&lt;fill_index&gt;)</u>
              This  command  changes  the  fill  pattern  of  the selected object to &lt;fill_index&gt;, which must be
              between 0 (for no fill) and 31.  If no object is  selected,  the  current  fill  pattern  will  be
              changed to &lt;fill_index&gt;.

       <u>set_selected_obj_pen(&lt;pen_index&gt;)</u>
              This  command  changes the pen of the selected object to &lt;pen_index&gt;, which must be between 0 (for
              no pen) and 31.  If no object is selected, the current pen will be changed to &lt;pen_index&gt;.

       <u>set_selected_obj_line_width(&lt;width&gt;,&lt;arrow_w&gt;,&lt;arrow_h&gt;)</u>
              This command changes the line width, arrow width, and arrow  height  of  the  selected  object  to
              &lt;width&gt;, &lt;arrow_w&gt;, and &lt;arrow_h&gt;, respectively.  If &lt;arrow_w&gt; or &lt;arrow_h&gt; is -1, the arrow width
              or  arrow  height, respectively, is not changed.  If no object is selected, the current line width
              will be changed  to  the  one  that  matches  &lt;width&gt;,  &lt;arrow_w&gt;,  and  &lt;arrow_h&gt;  most  closely.
              (Closeness  is  measured  such  that the difference in width is counted 10 times the difference in
              arrow width and arrow height.)

       <u>set_selected_obj_spline(&lt;spline_type&gt;)</u>
              This command changes the spline type of  the  selected  object  to  &lt;spline_type&gt;,  which  can  be
              <u>straight</u>,  <u>spline</u>, <u>interpolated</u>, or <u>structured</u>.  If no object is selected, the current spline type
              will be changed to &lt;spline_type&gt;.

       <u>set_selected_obj_arrow(&lt;arrow_type&gt;)</u>
              This command changes the arrow type of the selected object to &lt;arrow_type&gt;,  which  can  be  <u>none</u>,
              <u>right</u>,  <u>left</u>,  or  <u>double</u>.   If  no  object is selected, the current arrow type will be changed to
              &lt;arrow_type&gt;.

       <u>set_selected_obj_dash(&lt;dash_index&gt;)</u>
              This command changes the dash type of the selected object to &lt;dash_index&gt;, which must be between 0
              (solid) and 8.  If no object is selected, the current dash type will be changed to &lt;dash_index&gt;.

              roman),  <u>b</u>  (for  bold),  <u>i</u>  (for italic), or <u>bi</u> (for bold-italic).  If no object is selected, the
              current text style will be changed to &lt;textstyle&gt;.

       <u>set_selected_text_size(&lt;size&gt;)</u>
              This command changes the text size of the selected object to &lt;size&gt;.   If  &lt;size&gt;  ends  with  the
              substring  "pt", then point size is used instead of text size.  If such as size cannot be found in
              the Size Menu, the closest size in the Size Menu will be used.  If  no  object  is  selected,  the
              current text size will be changed to &lt;size&gt; or the closest size.

       <u>set_selected_text_underline(&lt;underline&gt;)</u>
              This  command  removes  text underline from the selected object if &lt;underline&gt; is 0; it underlines
              text in the selected object if &lt;underline&gt; is any other numeric value.  If no object is  selected,
              the current text underline will be changed accordingly.

       <u>set_selected_text_overline(&lt;overline&gt;)</u>
              This  command removes text overline from the selected object if &lt;overline&gt; is 0; it overlines text

              can be raised to the top.

       <u>shuffle_obj_to_bottom(&lt;obj_name&gt;)</u>
              This command move &lt;obj_name&gt; to the bottom.  If &lt;obj_name&gt; is a subobject, it is  dropped  to  the
              bottom,  relative  to  its  siblings.   This command is useful in animation where a selected frame
              (subobject) can be dropped to the bottom.

       <u>disable_undo()</u>
              This command cleans up the undo/redo records  and  disable  undo  (and  stop  recording  undo/redo
              information).   The  original  history  depth is saved away.  This command should be used before a
              long animation sequence.

       <u>enable_undo()</u>
              This command restores the history depth saved away  by  the  disable_undo()  command  and  enables
              undo/redo.  This command should be eventually used after disable_undo() is called.

              specified by &lt;x_attr_name&gt; and &lt;y_attr_name&gt;.  The object specified by &lt;obj_name&gt; must be either a
              poly/open-spline or a polygon/closed-spline object.

       <u>move_a_poly_vertex_absolute(&lt;obj_name&gt;,&lt;index&gt;,&lt;abs_x&gt;,&lt;abs_y&gt;)</u>
              This   command   moves   the   &lt;index&gt;<u>th</u>   vertex   of   &lt;obj_name&gt;  to  the  absolute  coordinate
              (&lt;abs_x&gt;,&lt;abs_y&gt;).  The object specified by &lt;obj_name&gt; must be  either  a  poly/open-spline  or  a

       <u>post_attr_and_get_cgi_result(&lt;url_attr&gt;,&lt;query_attr&gt;,&lt;result_attr&gt;)</u>
              This  command  makes  an  HTTP request using the <u>POST</u> method.  &lt;url_attr&gt; names the attribute that
              contains the URL (which usually names a CGI server  script).   &lt;query_attr&gt;  names  the  attribute
              whose  value  is  the  data  to  be  posted.   &lt;result_attr&gt; names the attribute for receiving the
              results.  For example, if an object has the following attributes:

                     url=<a href="http://bourbon.usc.edu">http://bourbon.usc.edu</a>:8001/cgi-bin/echo-post
                     query=Hello World!

                     exec=post_attr_and_get_cgi_result(url,query,result)

              executing this object will post "Hello World!" to the specified CGI script.   In  this  case,  the
              result  of executing the script just echoes "Hello World!" back (along with some other bookkeeping
              information).

       <u>navigate_back()</u>
              This command performs the same operation as if the NavigateBack() is selected  from  the  Navigate

              This command assigns the square-root of &lt;expr&gt; to &lt;attr_name&gt;.  &lt;expr&gt; must be evaluated to a non-
              negative numeric value.

       <u>random(&lt;attr_name&gt;)</u>
              This  command  assigns  a random integer to &lt;attr_name&gt; using the C library function <u>rand()</u>.  0 is
              used as a seed for the random number generator.

       <u>srand48(&lt;use_cur_time_as_seed&gt;)</u>
              This  command  seeds  the  random  generator  used  by  the  C  library  function  <u>drand48()</u>.   If
              &lt;use_cur_time_as_seed&gt;  is  0, 0 will be used as a seed.  Otherwise, the current time will be used
              as a seed.

       <u>drand48(&lt;attr_name&gt;)</u>
              This command assigns a floating pointer number between 0.0 and 1.0  to  &lt;attr_name&gt;  using  the  C
              library function <u>drand48()</u>.

       <u>round(&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;expr&gt;)</u>
              This command assigns the round of &lt;expr&gt; to &lt;attr_name&gt;.

       <u>redraw_obj(&lt;obj_name&gt;)</u>
              This command redraws the area occupied by &lt;obj_name&gt;.

       <u>redraw_drawing_area()</u>

       <u>itox(&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;digits&gt;,&lt;expr&gt;)</u>
              This command assigns &lt;attr_name&gt; to be the hex value of &lt;expr&gt;.  &lt;digits&gt; (which must be between 1
              and 8, inclusive) is the final width of the hex value (zeroes are added on the left).

       <u>for_i(&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;min_val&gt;,&lt;max_val&gt;,&lt;increment&gt;,&lt;cmd_attr_name&gt;)</u>
              This command is the same as the following sequence of commands:

                     assign(&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;min_val&gt;);
                     while($(&lt;attr_name&gt;) &lt;= &lt;max_val&gt;,<u>loop</u>)

              where <u>loop</u> has the following value:

                     exec(&lt;cmd_attr_name&gt;);
                     inc(&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;increment&gt;)

              Please note that &lt;min_val&gt;, &lt;max_val&gt;, and &lt;increment&gt; are only evaluated once prior the execution
              of this command.

       <u>set_file_not_modified()</u>
              This command sets the file modified flag to false.

       <u>new_id(&lt;attr_name&gt;)</u>
              This  command  generates  an  object  ID, which is unique in the current drawing, and stores it in
              &lt;attr_name&gt;.

       <u>rotate_selected_obj(&lt;angle&gt;)</u>
              This command rotates the selected object by &lt;angle&gt; degrees.  Positive angle is clockwise.

       <u>call_simple_shortcut(&lt;shortcut_name&gt;)</u>
              This command calls a shortcut named &lt;shortcut_name&gt; which takes  no  arguments.   Please  see  the
              SHORTCUTS section for a description of shortcuts.

       <u>call_one_arg_shortcut(&lt;shortcut_name&gt;,&lt;arg&gt;)</u>
              This  command  calls  a shortcut named &lt;shortcut_name&gt; that takes one argument and passes &lt;arg&gt; to
              it.  Please see the SHORTCUTS section for a description of shortcuts.

       <u>substitute_attr(&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;src_attr_name&gt;,&lt;replace_attr_name&gt;,&lt;pattern_str&gt;)</u>
              This command replaces occurrences of &lt;pattern_str&gt; in the value part of the attribute specified by
              &lt;src_attr_name&gt; by the value of the attribute  specified  by  &lt;replace_attr_name&gt;  and  write  the
              result into the attribute specified by &lt;attr_name&gt;.

       <u>get_file_size(&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;file_name&gt;)</u>
              This  command  puts  the  size  of  file  specified  by  &lt;file_name&gt; in the attribute specified by
              &lt;attr_name&gt;.

       <u>is_file(&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;file_name&gt;)</u>
              This command puts a "1" in the attribute  specified  by  &lt;attr_name&gt;  if  the  file  specified  by
              &lt;file_name&gt; exists.  It puts a "0" otherwise.

       <u>index(&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;string&gt;,&lt;sub_string&gt;)</u>
              This  command  finds  the  first  occurrence of &lt;sub_string&gt; in &lt;string&gt; and copies the zero-based
              index into &lt;attr_name&gt;.

       <u>rindex(&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;string&gt;,&lt;sub_string&gt;)</u>
              This command finds the last occurrence of &lt;sub_string&gt; in &lt;string&gt; and copies the zero-based index
              into &lt;attr_name&gt;.

       <u>get_number_of_lines_in_attr(&lt;result_attr&gt;,&lt;attr_name&gt;)</u>
              This command counts the number of lines in the attribute specified by &lt;attr_name&gt; and  writes  the
              count into &lt;result_attr&gt;.

       <u>get_line_in_attr(&lt;result_attr&gt;,&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;line_number&gt;)</u>
              This  command  copies  the  <u>n</u>th line of the attribute specified by &lt;attr_name&gt; into &lt;result_attr&gt;,
              where <u>n</u> is a zero-based index specified by &lt;line_number&gt;.

       <u>trim(&lt;attr_name&gt;)</u>
              This command removes leading and  trailing  blank  characters  from  the  attribute  specified  by
              &lt;attr_name&gt;.

       <u>is_attr(&lt;result_attr&gt;,&lt;attr_name&gt;)</u>
              This command writes a "1" into &lt;result_attr&gt; if the attribute specified by &lt;attr_name&gt; exists.  It
              writes a "0" into &lt;result_attr&gt; otherwise.

       <u>find_obj_names(&lt;result_attr&gt;,&lt;obj_name&gt;,&lt;attr_name_value&gt;)</u>
              This  command  finds all objects that are direct sub-objects of the object specified by &lt;obj_name&gt;
              and writes their names into &lt;result_attr&gt;.  If  &lt;obj_name&gt;  is  an  empty  string,  all  top-level
              objects are scanned.

              &lt;attr_name_value&gt;  specifies  a filter for the objects.  If &lt;attr_name_value&gt; is the empty string,
              all qualifying objects are selected.  If &lt;attr_name_value&gt; is of the form "&lt;string&gt;=*", an  object
              is  selected  if  it  has  an  attribute  named  &lt;string&gt;.   If  &lt;attr_name_value&gt;  is of the form
              "&lt;string&gt;=&lt;value&gt;", an object  is  selected  if  it  has  an  attribute  named  &lt;string&gt;  and  its
              corresponding  value  is  &lt;value&gt;.   If  &lt;attr_name_value&gt;  does not contain the '=' character, an
              object is selected if it has an attribute whose name is  empty  and  the  corresponding  value  is
              identical to &lt;attr_name_value&gt;.

              If <u>n</u> objects are matched, the attribute specified by &lt;result_attr&gt; is updated with <u>n+1</u> lines.  The
              value  of  the  zeroth  line  becomes  <u>n</u>  and  the  object  names  becomes  lines  1  through <u>n</u> of
              &lt;result_attr&gt;.  The get_line_in_attr() internal command can be used to retrieve the object names.

       <u>find_obj_names_on_all_pages(&lt;result_attr&gt;,&lt;attr_name_value&gt;)</u>
              This command is similar to find_obj_names() above, except that it only finds top-level objects  on
              all  pages.   The result is written into &lt;result_attr&gt;.  For a multi-page file, a top-level object
              name <u>&lt;name&gt;</u> will be written into &lt;result_attr&gt; as <u>##&lt;page_num&gt;!&lt;name&gt;</u>.  For  a  single-page  file,
              this command behaves exactly the same as find_obj_names(&lt;result_attr,"",&lt;attr_name_value&gt;).

       <u>tg2_find_obj_names_on_all_pages(&lt;result_attr&gt;,&lt;attr_name_value&gt;)</u>
              This  command  is  identical  to find_obj_names_on_all_pages() above, except that for a multi-page
              file, a top-level object name <u>&lt;name&gt;</u> will be written into &lt;result_attr&gt; as <u>&lt;name&gt;_Page&lt;page_num&gt;</u>.

       <u>tokenize(&lt;result_attr&gt;,&lt;string&gt;,&lt;separator&gt;)</u>
              This command breaks &lt;string&gt; into tokens which are separated  by  the  &lt;separator&gt;  character  and
              writes  the  tokens  (in  the same fashion as in the find_obj_names() internal command above) into
              &lt;result_attr&gt;.  &lt;separator&gt; must be a string of  length  of  1  and  it  must  not  be  the  space
              character,  the  single-quote  character,  or the double-quote character.  If a token contains the
              separator character, the token can be surrounded by a pair of single-quotes or double-quotes which
              are automatically removed when this command is executed.

              If <u>n</u> tokens are found, the attribute specified by &lt;result_attr&gt; is updated with  <u>n+1</u>  lines.   The
              value of the zeroth line becomes <u>n</u> and the tokens becomes lines 1 through <u>n</u> of &lt;result_attr&gt;.  The
              get_line_in_attr() internal command can be used to retrieve the tokens.

       <u>move_attr_relative(&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;dx&gt;,&lt;dy&gt;)</u>
              This  command  moves  the  attribute  whose  name  is  &lt;attr_name&gt; by &lt;dx&gt; absolute units in the x
              direction and &lt;dy&gt; absolute units in the y direction.

       <u>get_number_of_vertices(&lt;result_attr&gt;,&lt;obj_name&gt;)</u>
              This  command  copies  the  number  of  vertices  of  the  object  specified  by  &lt;obj_name&gt;  into
              &lt;result_attr&gt;.   The  specified  object  must  be  a  polyline (open-spline) or a polygon (closed-
              spline).

       <u>is_obj_transformed(&lt;result_attr&gt;,&lt;obj_name&gt;)</u>
              This command writes a "1" into &lt;result_attr&gt; if the object specified by &lt;obj_name&gt; is  transformed
              (rotated or sheared).  It writes a "0" into &lt;result_attr&gt; otherwise.

       <u>make_selected_obj_iconic(&lt;sym_path&gt;)</u>
              This  command  works  like the MakeIconic() command from the Special Menu, except that the user is
              not prompted for the name of the icon.  Instead, &lt;sym_path&gt; is used to specify the full path  name
              of the icon.

       <u>get_tgif_version(&lt;major_attr,minor_attr,patchlevel_attr,build_attr&gt;)</u>
              This  command  writes  tgif's  major  version  number, minor version number, patchlevel, and build
              information into &lt;major_attr&gt;, &lt;minor_attr&gt;, &lt;patchlevel_attr&gt; and &lt;build_attr&gt;, respectively.  If
              an argument is the string <u>NULL</u> (case-sensitive), that information is skipped.

       <u>get_tgif_dir(&lt;result_attr&gt;)</u>
              This command writes "$HOME/.Tgif" into &lt;result_attr&gt; where $HOME is  the  home  directory  of  the
              user.

       <u>get_profile_string(&lt;result_attr&gt;,&lt;section&gt;,&lt;key&gt;,&lt;def_value&gt;,&lt;ini_path&gt;)</u>
              This  command gets the value associated with the key specified by &lt;key&gt; from the section specified
              by &lt;section&gt; in the file specified by the full path &lt;ini_path&gt; and stores it  into  the  attribute
              specified  by &lt;result_attr&gt;.  If there is not value associated with the specified key, &lt;def_value&gt;
              is stored into &lt;result_attr&gt;.  If &lt;key&gt; is an empty string, all the  key  names  in  &lt;section&gt;  of
              &lt;ini_path&gt; will be written (in the same fashion as in the find_obj_names() internal command above)
              into  &lt;result_attr&gt;.  If &lt;section&gt; is an empty string, all the section names in &lt;ini_path&gt; will be
              written  (in  the  same  fashion  as  in  the  find_obj_names()  internal  command   above)   into
              &lt;result_attr&gt;.

       <u>write_profile_string(&lt;section&gt;,&lt;key&gt;,&lt;value&gt;,&lt;ini_path&gt;)</u>
              This command sets the value associated with the key specified by &lt;key&gt; of the section specified by
              &lt;section&gt;  in  the file specified by the full path &lt;ini_path&gt; to be &lt;value&gt;.  If &lt;key&gt; is an empty
              string, all key/value pairs in &lt;section&gt; of &lt;ini_path&gt; will be cleared.  &lt;section&gt; should  not  be
              an empty string.

       <u>select_additional_obj(&lt;obj_name&gt;)</u>
              This  command  silently  (no  highlighting handles) selects an additional object named &lt;obj_name&gt;.
              Please see the OBJECT NAMES section above for the specification of object names.

       <u>open_file(&lt;file_number&gt;,&lt;file_name&gt;,&lt;file_mode&gt;)</u>
              This command opens the file specified by &lt;file_name&gt; in the  mode  specified  by  &lt;file_mode&gt;  and
              assigns  the  opened  file  a  file reference number of &lt;file_number&gt;.  &lt;file_number&gt; must be 0 or
              between 3 and 15.  Opening file 0 <u>rewinds</u> the standard input.   Examples  of  modes  are  "r"  for
              reading,  "w"  for  writing,  and "a" for appending.  A file is always opened in text (non-binary)
              mode.

       <u>close_file(&lt;file_number&gt;)</u>
              This command closes the file associated with file reference number  &lt;file_number&gt;.   &lt;file_number&gt;
              must be 0 or between 3 and 15.

       <u>read_file(&lt;file_number&gt;,&lt;result_attr&gt;)</u>
              This  command  reads  a line from the file associated with file reference number &lt;file_number&gt; and
              put the line in the attribute specified by &lt;result_attr&gt;.  &lt;file_number&gt; must be  between  0  (for
              standard input) or between 3 and 15.

       <u>write_file(&lt;file_number&gt;,&lt;string&gt;)</u>
              This  command  writes  &lt;string&gt;  to  the file associated with file reference number &lt;file_number&gt;.
              &lt;file_number&gt; must be between 1 and 15.  Numbers 1 and 2 are  for  standard  output  and  standard
              error files.

       <u>flush_file(&lt;file_number&gt;)</u>
              This  command flushes the file associated with file reference number &lt;file_number&gt;.  &lt;file_number&gt;
              must be between 1 and 15.  Numbers 1 and 2 are for standard output and standard error files.

       <u>append_file(&lt;dest_file_name&gt;,&lt;src_file_name&gt;)</u>

              &lt;dest_file_name&gt;.

       <u>set_output_format(&lt;format&gt;,&lt;color_output&gt;)</u>
              This  command  sets the output format to &lt;format&gt;.  If &lt;color_output&gt; is 0, black and white output
              (printing) mode will be used; otherwise, color output (printing) mode will be  used.   Please  see
              the Tgif.WhereToPrint X default for a list of possible formats.

       <u>set_export_clip_rect(&lt;ltx&gt;,&lt;lty&gt;,&lt;rbx&gt;,&lt;rby&gt;)</u>
              This command sets the export clipping rectangle to be a rectangular region with left-top corner at
              (&lt;ltx&gt;,&lt;lty&gt;)  and  right-bottom  corner at (&lt;rbx&gt;,&lt;rby&gt;).  &lt;ltx&gt; must be strictly less than &lt;rbx&gt;
              and &lt;lty&gt; must be strictly less than &lt;rby&gt;.

       <u>import_file(&lt;file_name&gt;,&lt;format&gt;,&lt;ltx&gt;,&lt;lty&gt;)</u>
              This command imports the file specified by &lt;file_name&gt; and places it at (&lt;ltx&gt;,&lt;lty&gt;).   The  file
              is  expected  to  be in the format specified by &lt;format&gt;, which can be "XBM", "XPM", "GIF", "PNG",
              "JPEG", "PBM", "PGM", "PPM", and  names  specified  by  the  Tgif.ImportFilter#  X  defaults.   If
              &lt;format&gt; is "TGIF", the file should either be a tgif file.

       <u>set_xpm_output_version(&lt;version_number&gt;)</u>
              This  command  sets  the  XPM  version  number  when  outputting  in  the  X11 pixmap format to be
              &lt;version_number&gt;.  &lt;version_number&gt; can take on values 1 or 3.

       <u>edit_ini_section(&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;title&gt;,&lt;section&gt;,&lt;ini_path&gt;)</u>
              This command brings up a dialogbox to  edit  the  section  specified  by  &lt;section&gt;  in  the  file
              specified  by  the  full  path  &lt;ini_path&gt;.  If the user press the OK button in the dialogbox, the
              section is cleared and the content of the dialogbox is written back into the  file,  and  "OK"  is
              placed  in  the  attribute  specified  by &lt;attr_name&gt;.  If the user press the CANCEL button in the
              dialogbox, the file  is  unmodified,  and  "CANCEL"  is  placed  in  the  attribute  specified  by
              &lt;attr_name&gt;.

       <u>select_from_ini_section(&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;title&gt;,&lt;section&gt;,&lt;ini_path&gt;)</u>
              This  command  brings  up a list to select an entry from the section specified by &lt;section&gt; in the
              file specified by the full path &lt;ini_path&gt;.  If nothing is selected, the  attribute  specified  by
              &lt;attr_name&gt;  will  be  cleared.   Otherwise, the selected entry will be written into the attribute
              specified by &lt;attr_name&gt;.

       <u>append_line_into_attr(&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;string&gt;)</u>
              This command appends the line specified by &lt;string&gt; to the attribute specified by &lt;attr_name&gt;.

       <u>insert_line_into_attr(&lt;attr_name&gt;,&lt;string&gt;,&lt;line_number&gt;)</u>
              This command inserts the line specified by &lt;string&gt; as the <u>n</u>th line of the attribute specified  by
              &lt;attr_name&gt;,  where <u>n</u> is a zero-based index specified by &lt;line_number&gt;.  <u>n</u> must be at least 1.  If
              <u>n</u> is larger than the number of lines in the attribute, blank lines are automatically inserted.

       <u>clear_attr(&lt;attr_name&gt;)</u>
              This command clears the attribute value of the attribute specified by &lt;attr_name&gt; and deletes  all

       <u>create_text_obj(&lt;abs_x&gt;,&lt;abs_baseline_y&gt;,&lt;string&gt;)</u>
              This  command  creates  a  text  object  at  the location (&lt;abs_x&gt;,&lt;abs_baseline_y&gt;) with the text
              specified by &lt;string&gt;.

       <u>create_box_obj(&lt;abs_ltx&gt;,&lt;abs_lty&gt;,&lt;abs_rbx&gt;,&lt;abs_rby&gt;)</u>
              This command creates a rectangle defined by (&lt;abs_ltx&gt;,&lt;abs_lty&gt;) and (&lt;abs_rbx&gt;,&lt;abs_rby&gt;).

       <u>create_corner_oval_obj(&lt;abs_ltx&gt;,&lt;abs_lty&gt;,&lt;abs_rbx&gt;,&lt;abs_rby&gt;)</u>
              This command creates a corner oval defined by (&lt;abs_ltx&gt;,&lt;abs_lty&gt;) and (&lt;abs_rbx&gt;,&lt;abs_rby&gt;).

       <u>create_center_oval_obj(&lt;abs_x&gt;,&lt;abs_y&gt;,&lt;radius&gt;)</u>
              This command creates a  center  oval  centered  at  (&lt;abs_x&gt;,&lt;abs_y&gt;)  with  radius  specified  by
              &lt;radius&gt;.

       <u>create_edge_oval_obj(&lt;abs_ltx&gt;,&lt;abs_lty&gt;,&lt;abs_rbx&gt;,&lt;abs_rby&gt;)</u>
              This command creates an edge circle defined by (&lt;abs_ltx&gt;,&lt;abs_lty&gt;) and (&lt;abs_rbx&gt;,&lt;abs_rby&gt;).

       <u>create_rcbox_obj(&lt;abs_ltx&gt;,&lt;abs_lty&gt;,&lt;abs_rbx&gt;,&lt;abs_rby&gt;)</u>
              This   command   creates   a   rounded-corner   rectangle  defined  by  (&lt;abs_ltx&gt;,&lt;abs_lty&gt;)  and
              (&lt;abs_rbx&gt;,&lt;abs_rby&gt;).

       <u>create_arc_obj(&lt;abs_x&gt;,&lt;abs_y&gt;,&lt;radius&gt;,&lt;dir&gt;,&lt;angle1&gt;,&lt;angle2&gt;)</u>
              This command creates an arc centered at (&lt;abs_x&gt;,&lt;abs_y&gt;) with radius, direction, start angle, and
              end angle specified by &lt;radius&gt;, &lt;dir&gt;,  &lt;angle1&gt;,  and  &lt;angle2&gt;,  respectively.   The  &lt;radius&gt;,
              &lt;dir&gt;,  &lt;angle1&gt;,  and  &lt;angle2&gt;  are  specified  in  the  same  way  as they are specified in the
              SpecifyAnArc() command under the CreateObject submenu of the Edit Menu.  &lt;dir&gt; can be "+"  or  "-"
              where  "+"  is  clockwise.   &lt;angle1&gt;  and &lt;angle2&gt; are in degrees with 0 degree at the 12 o'clock
              position.

       <u>create_first_vertex(&lt;abs_x&gt;,&lt;abs_y&gt;)</u>
              This command is used in conjunction with the create_next_vertex() and  create_poly_obj()  commands
              to  create  a  polyline/open-spline  object.   It  can  also  be  used  in  conjunction  with  the
              create_next_vertex() and create_polygon_obj() commands to create a  polygon/closed-spline  object.
              This  command  sets  the  starting point of the polyline/open-spline object or the polygon/closed-
              spline object to be at (&lt;abs_x&gt;,&lt;abs_y&gt;).

       <u>create_next_vertex(&lt;abs_x&gt;,&lt;abs_y&gt;)</u>
              This command is used in conjunction with the create_first_vertex() and create_poly_obj()  commands
              to  create  a  polyline/open-spline  object.   It  can  also  be  used  in  conjunction  with  the
              create_first_vertex() and create_polygon_obj() commands to create a polygon/closed-spline  object.
              This  command sets the next vertex of the polyline/open-spline object or the polygon/closed-spline
              object to be at (&lt;abs_x&gt;,&lt;abs_y&gt;).

       <u>create_poly_obj()</u>
              This command is used  in  conjunction  with  the  create_first_vertex()  and  create_next_vertex()
              commands to create a polyline/open-spline object.

       <u>create_polygon_obj()</u>
              This  command  is  used  in  conjunction  with  the create_first_vertex() and create_next_vertex()
              commands to create a polygon/closed-spline object.

       <u>start_create_group_obj()</u>
              This command is used in conjunction with  the  create_group_obj()  command  to  create  a  grouped
              object.  This command marks the beginning of the group.

       <u>create_group_obj()</u>
              This  command is used in conjunction with the start_create_group_obj() command to create a grouped
              object.  This command groups all objects created since the last start_create_group_obj() call into
              a grouped object.

       <u>set_allow_interrupt(&lt;true_or_false&gt;)</u>
              If &lt;true_or_false&gt; is <u>FALSE</u> (case-sensitive), this command is used to temporarily disable an  user
              interrupt  when  tgif  is  executing  internal  commands.   If  a  user interrupt is received when
              interrupt is disabled, it will be queued and will interrupt the  execution  of  internal  commands
              when set_allow_interrupt() is called again with &lt;true_or_false&gt; being <u>TRUE</u> (case-sensitive).

       <u>select_each_obj_and_exec(&lt;attr_name_to_exec&gt;)</u>
              This  command  first  unselects  any  object that is selected.  It then selects each object in the
              current drawing in turn and executes the internal command  specified  by  the  &lt;attr_name_to_exec&gt;
              attribute.   If this command is executed as a result of a mouse click over an object, only objects
              in the current page will be scanned for execution.  If this command  is  executed  from  a  script
              file, objects in every page will be scanned for execution.

       <u>edit_attr_in_text_mode(&lt;attr_name&gt;)</u>
              When this command is executed, tgif enters the text drawing mode and edits the attribute specified
              by &lt;attr_name&gt;.

       <u>set_file_unsavable()</u>
              This command is used to make the current file unsavable.

       <u>pstoepsi(&lt;target_eps_path&gt;,&lt;src_ps_path&gt;,&lt;scale&gt;)</u>
              This  command  generates a preview bitmap for the PostScript file in &lt;src_ps_path&gt; and prepends it
              to &lt;src_ps_path&gt; and save the output in &lt;target_eps_path&gt; (&lt;src_ps_path&gt; is unmodified).  The only
              accepted values of &lt;scale&gt; is 1 or 2.  If the Tgif.ExternalPsToEpsi X default is set to true, this
              command will simply invoke "pstoepsi &lt;src_ps_path&gt; &lt;target_eps_path&gt;" externally if &lt;scale&gt;  is  1
              and will invoke "pstoepsi -2x &lt;src_ps_path&gt; &lt;target_eps_path&gt;" if &lt;scale&gt; is 2.  This command only
              works if tgif is running in the interactive (non-batch) mode.

       <u>objs_bbox_intersect(&lt;obj1_name&gt;,&lt;obj2_name&gt;,&lt;result_attr&gt;)</u>
              This  command  sets  the  value  of  the  attribute  specified  by  &lt;result_attr&gt;  to  "1"  if the
              boundingboxes of objects named &lt;obj1_name&gt; and &lt;obj2_name&gt; intersect.  It sets the  value  of  the
              attribute specified by &lt;result_attr&gt; to "0" otherwise.

       <u>delete_all_attr_from_selected_objs()</u>
              This  command  deletes  all  attributes  from selected objects.  Please only use this command when
              commands are taken from an external file!

       <u>random_permute_lines_in_attr(&lt;attr_name&gt;)</u>
              This command randomly permutes lines of an attribute specified by &lt;attr_name&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>GENERATING</b> <b>IMAGEMAP</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       This   section   describes   how  to  generate  NCSA  imagemap  and  CERN  clickable  image  files.   The
       Tgif.ImageMapFileFormat X default decides whether to generate a NCSA imagemap or a CERN  clickable  image
       file.   Since the two formats are very similar, we will only discuss how to generate NCSA imagemap files.
       For more information about NCSA imagemap, please see [3].  For  more  information  about  CERN  clickable
       image, please see [4].

       The  Tgif.GenerateImageMap  X  default should be set to ``true'' to enable the imagemap generation.  When
       printing in the GIF format (see the BASIC FUNCTIONALITIES section about printing),  an  XPM  file  (which
       will  be  removed  at  the  end  of  this  process)  is  generated  first.   (The  value specified by the
       Tgif.InitExportPixelTrim X default is used to trim extra pixels.  Using  these  values  forms  an  escape
       mechanism to fix an idiosyncrasy that tgif can not figure out exactly how big the whole image is.)

       The    XPM    version    is    specified    by   the   Tgif.XPmOutputVersion   X   default   unless   the
       Tgif.UseXPmVersion1ForImageMap X default is set to ``true'', which forces  the  XPM1  format.   Then  the
       command  specified by the Tgif.XpmToGif X default is executed to convert the XPM file into a GIF (Generic
       Interchange Format) file which can be used by software such as NCSA's <a href="../man1/Mosaic.1.html">Mosaic</a>(1).  The file extension  for
       the  GIF  file  is  specified  by  the  Tgif.GifFileExtension  X default.  Together with the GIF file, an
       imagemap file with file extension specified by the Tgif.ImageMapFileExtension  X  default  is  generated.
       The content of the imagemap is generated as follows.

       Tgif first looks for a <u>file</u> <u>attribute</u> with attribute name <u>href</u>.  The value of the attribute is written as
       the  <u>default</u>  <u>URL</u>.   If such a file attribute can not be found, imagemap generation is aborted.  If it is
       found, then all objects in the file are scanned.  For an object having an attribute named <u>href</u>, the value
       of the attribute is written as the <u>URL</u> for a <u>method</u> line in the imagemap.  If the  object  is  neither  a
       circle nor a poly/polygon, the <u>rectangle</u> method is used.

       Similar  mechanism is used when printing in the HTML format, except that a generic HTML file is generated
       with an imagemap in the Spy Glass Client-side Imagemap format.  You can generate a custom  HTML  file  if
       you  specify an HTML export template using SetHTMLExportTemplate() from the File Menu.  Details about the
       template file is described below.

</pre><h4><b>HTML</b> <b>EXPORT</b> <b>TEMPLATE</b></h4><pre>
       If an HTML export template file is specified with the SetHTMLExportTemplate() from the File Menu,  custom
       HTML  files can be generated when printing in the HTML format.  The customization is done through the use
       of variables embedded in the HTML export template file.  These variables  have  the  syntax  of  an  HTML
       character entity.  They all starts with "&amp;tgv" and ends with ";".  They are:

       <u>&amp;tgvfilename;</u>
              This variable will be replaced by the name of the file (without file extension).

       <u>&amp;tgvcurnum;</u>
              This variable will be replaced by current page number.

       <u>&amp;tgvfirstnum;</u>
              This variable will be replaced by the first page number (usually 1).

       <u>&amp;tgvlastnum;</u>
              This variable will be replaced by last page number.

       <u>&amp;tgvprevnum;</u>
              This variable will be replaced by the previous page number (with wrap around).

       <u>&amp;tgvprevnumnowrap;</u>
              This variable will be replaced by the previous page number (with no wrap around).

       <u>&amp;tgvnextnum;</u>
              This variable will be replaced by the next page number (with wrap around).

       <u>&amp;tgvnextnumnowrap;</u>
              This variable will be replaced by the next page number (with no wrap around).

       <u>&amp;tgvtitle;</u>
              This variable will be replaced by the title the page or of the file.

       <u>&amp;tgvmapobjs;</u>
              This  variable  will  be replaced by the objects (specified as &lt;AREA&gt; tabs) in a client-side image
              map.

       For example, if a template specifies:

              &lt;IMG SRC="&amp;tgvfilename;-&amp;tgvcurnum;.gif"
                     USEMAP="#p0"&gt;
              &lt;MAP NAME="p0"&gt;
              &amp;tgvmapobjs;
              &lt;AREA SHAPE="RECT"
                     COORDS="0,0,&amp;tgvmapwidth;,&amp;tgvmapheight;"
                     HREF="&amp;tgvfilename;-&amp;tgvnextnum;.html"&gt;
              &lt;/MAP&gt;

       Exporting using PrintOneFilePerPage() with this template may get (for page 2 of  a  file  name  "foo.obj"
       with 5 pages):

              &lt;IMG SRC="foo-2.gif"
                     USEMAP="#p0"&gt;
              &lt;MAP NAME="p0"&gt;
              &lt;AREA SHAPE="RECT" ...&gt;
               ...
              &lt;AREA SHAPE="RECT" ...&gt;
              &lt;AREA SHAPE="RECT"
                     COORDS="0,0,145,97"
                     HREF="foo-3.html"&gt;
              &lt;/MAP&gt;

</pre><h4><b>GENERATING</b> <b>MICROSOFT</b> <b>WINDOWS</b> <b>EPSI</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Some   Microsoft  Windows  (TM)  applications  do  not  understand  standard  PostScript  %%BeginPreview,
       %%EndImage, and %%EndPreview comments.  This section describes how to generate  an  EPSI  file  which  is
       understood  by  them.   This feature is invoked when the current print format is TiffEPSI.  In this case,
       the generated EPSI file will contain 30 bytes of binary information in the beginning of the  file  and  a
       TIFF  image  (also  binary)  at the end of the file.  This file also will not contain the %%BeginPreview,
       %%EndImage, and %%EndPreview comments.  A file in  this  format  is  normally  not  considered  to  be  a
       PostScript file except under Windows.

       When  this  feature is enabled, tgif generates a normal EPSI file first, then dump the current content of
       the file into an X11 bitmap file.  The command specified in Tgif.XbmToTiff is executed to generate a TIFF
       image which is then append at the end of the EPSI file.

</pre><h4><b>LOCKING</b> <b>OBJECTS</b></h4><pre>
       Objects can be locked and unlocked using #&lt; and #&gt; keyboard commands.  When a selected object is  locked,
       it is shown with gray handles.  A locked object cannot be moved, stretched, flipped, or rotated; however,
       its  properties,  such as fill pattern, width, etc., can be changed.  Locked objects can also be deleted.
       When a locked object is grouped with other objects, the resulting  grouped  object  is  also  locked.   A
       locked  object  can  be  used as an anchor to align other objects; however, DistributeObjs() command will
       fail if any objects are locked.  Locked objects do not participate in any operations in the select vertex
       mode.

</pre><h4><b>UNDO/REDO</b></h4><pre>
       Most operations can be undone and redone.  The Tgif.HistoryDepth X default controls the size of the  undo
       buffer.   If  it  is set to -1, then the undo buffer's size is infinite.  The undo buffer is flushed when
       the New() or Open() commands are executed (from the File Menu), when  the  FlushUndoBuffer()  command  is
       executed  from  the Edit Menu, or when Pop() is executed from a .sym file.  If a private colormap is used
       (automatically done when  new  colors  can  not  be  allocated  from  the  default  colormap),  executing
       FlushUndoBuffer()  will  attempt to reset the colormap (if the -DDONT_FREE_COLORMAP compile option is not
       used).

</pre><h4><b>DOMAINS</b></h4><pre>
       A <u>domain</u> is a collection of library symbols suitable for instantiations.  A library is implemented  as  a
       directory  of  .sym files, and therefore, a domain is implemented as a search path.  If there are symbols
       with the same file name which reside in different directories specified in the search path, then the  one
       closer to the front of the search path will be made available for the user to instantiate.

       The  number  of  domains  is  specified  by  the  MaxDomains  X default, and the names of the domains are
       specified by the DomainPath# X default.  The library  search  paths  are  specified  by  csh  environment
       variables.  See the section on X DEFAULTS for more details.

       Domain  information  can  also  be loaded into the <a href="file:~/.Tgif/domain.ini">~/.Tgif/domain.ini</a> file by setting Tgif.DomainInIni to
       true and selecting Reload Domain Info From X from the Domain submenu of the File Menu.

</pre><h4><b>SELECTING</b> <b>A</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>A</b> <b>POPUP</b> <b>WINDOW</b></h4><pre>
       When selecting a file name, a symbol name, or a domain name, tgif pops up a window with appropriate names
       for the user to choose from.  The user can use mouse clicks to select an entry.  Key strokes can also  be
       used  to  specify  the  desired  name;  however, tgif attempts to match the key strokes with names in the
       selection on the fly.  If a match can not be found,  the  key  strokes  are  ignored.   ^n,  ^j,  or  the
       DownArrow  key  advances the selection down by 1 entry; ^p, ^k, or the UpArrow key advances the selection
       up by 1 entry.  ^f, ^d, or the DownArrow key with &lt;Control&gt; key held down advances the selection down  by
       10  entries;  ^b,  ^u,  or  the  UpArrow key with &lt;Control&gt; key held down advances the selection up by 10
       entries.  '$' will select the last entry, while '^' will select the first entry.  ^w or ^y un-select  the
       selected  entry.   If  the  selected  entry  is  a directory, hitting &lt;CR&gt; will change directory; if not,
       hitting &lt;CR&gt; finishes the selection process and the selected entry is returned.

       In selecting file names to open or import, typing '/' is interpreted as going to the  root  directory  or
       specifying  an  URL.   At this point, the automatic matching of key strokes is temporarily disabled until
       either a &lt;TAB&gt; or a &lt;CR&gt; is pressed.  Also, clicking the middle mouse button in the file name area pastes
       from the clipboard.

       The automatic appending of <u>index.obj</u> or <u>.obj</u> (introduced in version 2.16) became obsolete and an  URL  is
       never modified.

       The  current  selection  is  displayed  near the top of the popup window.  Back-space should be used with
       caution because it might change the current directory to the parent directory.

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTING</b> <b>EPS</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files can be imported using the #( keyboard command.  If the EPS file has a
       preview bitmap (can be generated using the <u>pstoepsi</u> tool), tgif will display  it  (HideBit/Pixmap()  from
       the  Layout  Menu can be used to disable the displaying of bitmap/pixmaps).  When the EPS object is saved
       in a .obj or .sym file, neither the preview bitmap, nor the PostScript content of the EPS file is  saved.
       Therefore,  when printing such a file (either from tgif or using prtgif), the EPS file must be present at
       the same place from which it was originally imported.

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTING</b> <b>LATEX</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Short</b> <b>Version</b>
       You can import a LaTeX equation into a <b>tgif</b> object.  When you select Instantiate from  the  Special  Menu
       (or  press  &lt;Cntrl&gt;i),  you  should  see  <b>eq4.sym</b>.  Double-click it and <b>tgif</b> will ask you to click on the
       drawing area to place it.  After you have placed  it,  you  have  instantiated  an  <b>eq4</b>  symbol  and  the
       instantiation is called an <b>eq4</b> object (or the LaTeX equation object).  Now you can go into edit text mode
       (e.g. press &lt;Cntrl&gt;w) and click anywhere inside the <b>eq=</b> attribute (i.e. the text of the equation) to edit
       the  equation.   Return  to select mode (e.g. press &lt;meta&gt;k) and double click on the <b>eq=</b> attribute to run
       <b>latex</b> on it and import the resulting EPSI file.

       If you have a large equation, you can right-click on  the  equation  object,  select  Edit  Attribute  in
       Editor,  and select <b>eq=</b> and edit the equation in an editor of your choice.  You can use the <b>Tgif.Editor</b> X
       default to select your editor, for example:
           Tgif.Editor:     xemacs -title '%s' '%s'

       To declutter your screen, you may select the <b>eq4</b> object and use the  shortcut  key  <b>T</b>  to  hide  the  <b>eq=</b>
       attribute.  Type <b>T</b> again to make it visible.

       Once  you import the EPSI file, you may use the left mouse button to drag either the <b>eq=</b> attribute or the
       imported graphic, and the other will follow.  If you hold the control key down,  you  can  drag  the  <b>eq=</b>
       attribute separately.

   <b>Details</b>
       Since version 4.1.16, the standard distribution of <b>tgif</b> comes with four LaTeX equation symbol files:
           eq4.sym
           eq4-2x.sym
           eq4-ps2epsi.sym
           eq4-epstool.sym

       The  Debian  package  installs these files in <u>/usr/share/tgif/latex</u>, and initializes <b>tgif</b> with one domain
       (number 0) called LaTeX.  When <b>tgif</b> starts, the default domain should be domain number 0, and <b>tgif</b> should
       look  for  *.sym  files  first   in   the   current   directory,   then   in   <u><a href="file:~/.tgif/latex">~/.tgif/latex</a></u>,   then   in
       <u>/usr/share/tgif/latex</u>.

       In order to use <b>eq4.sym</b>, in addition to <b>latex</b> and <b>dvips</b>, you need:

       <b>pstoepsi</b> to convert a <b>PS</b> (PostScript) file generated by
              <b>dvips</b> to an <b>EPSI</b> (encapsulated PostScript file with a preview bitmap) file

       <b>netpbm</b> used by <b>pstoepsi</b> to convert a <b>PBM</b> file to a preview bitmap for the final <b>EPSI</b> file

       <b>ghostscript</b>
              used by <b>pstoepsi</b> to render a <b>PS</b> file into a <b>PBM</b> file

       Once  you have these tools properly installed, you can simply instantiate <b>eq4.sym</b> and change the value of
       the <b>eq=</b> attribute.

       Just double-click the equation object and <b>tgif</b> will run the following commands:
           latex <u>tmpfile</u>
           dvips -N -n 1 -o <u>tmpfile</u>.ps <u>tmpfile</u>
           pstoepsi <u>tmpfile</u>.ps <u>tmpfile</u>.eps
       where <u>tmpfile</u> is a temporary file generated by <b>tgif</b> (usually in <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>) and the file name starts with <b>Tgif</b>.

       This should work if everything is installed properly.  In case it does not work, you will  get  an  error
       messagebox.   Do  not close the box.  Change directory into <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> and look for the latest file that starts
       with <b>Tgif</b> and ends in <b>.tex</b> and copy it.  Then run the above commands manually to debug the problem.   For
       example, you can do:
           cd <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>
           ls -lrt Tgif*

       (Please  note  that  in the above listing, TgifmTaOdC.ps and TgifmTaOdC.eps have the same file size, this
       means that <b>pstoepsi</b> did <u>not</u> work.)
           cp TgifmTaOdC.tex foo.tex
           latex foo
           dvips -N -n 1 -o foo.ps foo
           pstoepsi foo.ps foo.eps
           more foo.eps
       At this point, you should see that the first few lines of <u>foo.eps</u> look like:
           %!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF-1.2
           %%BoundingBox: 258 634 354 653
           %%BeginPreview: 97 20 1 20
           % 00000000000000000000000e00
           % ...
           % 00000000000000000003c00000
           %%EndImage
           %%EndPreview
           ...
       These lines are added by <b>pstoepsi</b>.  The numbers in the <b>%%BoundingBox:</b> and <b>%%BeginPreview:</b> depends on your
       equation and the <b>PS-Adobe</b> and <b>EPSF</b> versions in the first line may vary depending on your setup.

       If you get errors when you run <b>latex</b>, <b>dvips</b>, or <b>pstoepsi</b> manually, there  is  something  wrong  with  the
       setup  of these tools.  If they all do the right thing but <b>tgif</b> still shows errors, please send e-mail to
       me!

       <u>eq4-2x.sym</u> can produce  a  higher  (2x)  resolution  preview  bitmap,  but  you  will  need  the  <u>special</u>
       netpbm-20may1999  version of <b>netpbm</b>.  It may not work with a newer version of <b>netpbm</b>.  <u>eq4-ps2epsi.sym</u> is
       not recommended.  <u>eq4-epstool.sym</u> is like <u>eq4.sym</u> but uses <b>epstool</b> instead.

</pre><h4><b>ADDITIONAL</b> <b>FONTS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the Times, Courier, Helvetica, NewCentury, and  Symbol  fonts,  additional  fonts  can  be
       specified  using  the  Tgif.AdditionalFonts  X  default.  (The default screen fonts can also be replaced,
       please see Tgif.HasAlternateDefaultFonts in the X DEFAULTS section for more  details.)   Each  additional
       font  requires  <u>4</u>  parts,  one for each font style (in the order of Roman, Bold, Italic, and BoldItalic).
       Each part contains <u>3</u> strings.  The first string specifies the family, weight, slant,  and  width  of  the
       font  (please  see  the  man pages for <a href="../man1/xfontsel.1.html">xfontsel</a>(1) for more details; also there is a second form which is
       described below).  The second string specifies the registry and encoding of  the  font  (see  <a href="../man1/xfontsel.1.html">xfontsel</a>(1)
       again).   (One  can  use  <a href="../man1/xlsfonts.1.html">xlsfonts</a>(1) to see what fonts are available and pick out the just mentioned two
       strings from the output.)  The third string specifies the PostScript font name.

       For example, if one wants to use the X Lucida font to represent the PostScript  ZapfChancery-MediumItalic
       font, one can set Tgif.AdditionalFonts as follows:

       Tgif.AdditionalFonts: \n\
               lucida-medium-r-normal \n\
               iso8859-1 \n\
               ZapfChancery-MediumItalic \n\
               \n\
               lucida-demibold-r-normal \n\
               iso8859-1 \n\
               ZapfChancery-MediumItalic \n\
               \n\
               lucida-medium-i-normal \n\
               iso8859-1 \n\
               ZapfChancery-MediumItalic \n\
               \n\
               lucida-demibold-i-normal \n\
               iso8859-1 \n\
               ZapfChancery-MediumItalic

       The  above maps all four font styles of the Lucida font to the ZapfChancery-MediumItalic font (similar to
       how Symbol font is handled).

       The first string can also be specified in a second form which is identified by having "%d" as part of the
       string.  For example, one can use "lucidasans-%d" as the first string.  In this case, the actual  X  font
       used  will  be  the  specified  string  with "%d" replaced by the font size.  The encoding string (second
       string) is ignored (but must be present).  The font name prefix (please see Tgif.FontNamePrefix entry  in
       the X DEFAULTS section) is also ignored.

</pre><h4><b>POSTSCRIPT</b> <b>CHARACTER</b> <b>ENCODING</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>INTERNATINOAL</b> <b>CHARACTERS</b></h4><pre>
       Sometimes,  different encodings of the same PostScript font is needed for characters <u>with</u> <u>character</u> <u>codes</u>
       <u>between</u> <u>161</u>  <u>and</u>  <u>255</u>  <u>(inclusive)</u>.   This  can  be  accomplished  in  two  ways.   One  way  is  to  use
       Tgif.AdditionalDontReencode (and Tgif.DontReencode).  Another way is to use Tgif.PSFontNeedCharSubs.  The
       difference  is  that  with  Tgif.AdditionalDontReencode,  a  PostScript font's encoding is skipped.  With
       Tgif.PSFontNeedCharSubs, characters in a PostScript font can be given specific encoding.

       In both cases, there is a need to introduce fake font names (place holders).  For example,

              Tgif.AdditionalFonts: \n\
                      utopia-medium-r-normal \n\
                      adobe-fontspecific \n\
                      UtopiaTmp-Regular \n\
                      \n\
                      utopia-bold-r-normal \n\
                      adobe-fontspecific \n\
                      UtopiaTmp-Bold \n\
                      \n\
                      utopia-medium-i-normal \n\
                      adobe-fontspecific \n\
                      UtopiaTmp-Italic \n\
                      \n\
                      utopia-bold-i-normal \n\
                      adobe-fontspecific \n\
                      UtopiaTmp-BoldItalic
              Tgif.PSFontAliases: \n\
                      UtopiaTmp-Regular=Utopia-Regular \n\
                      UtopiaTmp-Bold=Utopia-Bold \n\
                      UtopiaTmp-Italic=Utopia-Italic \n\
                      UtopiaTmp-BoldItalic=Utopia-BoldItalic

       In the above example, 4 fake PostScript font names are created (all have a  common  "UtopiaTmp"  prefix).
       The   encoding   for   these   fonts   is   adobe-fontspecific,  according  the  X11  fonts  being  used.
       Tgif.PSFontAliases maps the fake PostScript font names to the corresponding real PostScript  font  names.
       (If  Tgif.PSFontAliases  is  missing,  non-existent  PostScript font names such as UtopiaTmp-Regular will
       appear in a PostScript file.)

       To skip a PostScript font's encoding,  one  can  use  the  Tgif.AdditionalDontReencode  X  default.   For
       example, if one specifies:

              Tgif.AdditionalDontReencode: UtopiaTmp

       characters  with  character  codes  between  161 and 255 (inclusive) will not be encoded with ISO-Latin-1
       character names.  For a list of characters names that are ISO-Latin-1 encoded, please see
       &lt;URL:<a href="http://bourbon.usc.edu/tgif/faq/charencode.html">http://bourbon.usc.edu/tgif/faq/charencode.html</a>#iso8859-1&gt;.

       To  substitute  characters  in  a  PostScript  font   with   specific   encoding,   one   can   use   the
       Tgif.PSFontNeedCharSubs  and  Tgif.PSCharSubs_*  X  defaults.   (You  still need Tgif.AdditionalFonts and
       Tgif.PSFontAliases setup as above.)  Here is an example:

              Tgif.PSFontNeedCharSubs: \n\
                      Utopia-Regular=Foo \n\
                      Utopia-Bold=Foo \n\
                      Utopia-Italic=Foo \n\
                      Utopia-BoldItalic=Foo
              Tgif.PSCharSubs_Foo: \n\
                      exclamdown/Aogonek \n\
                      AE/Cacute \n\
                      ecircumflex/eogonek

       In the above example, Tgif.PSFontNeedCharSubs specified  a  list  of  fake  PostScript  font  names  that
       requires  character  substitutions  and their corresponding TOKEN names.  For a fake PostScript font name
       that maps to <u>TOKEN</u>, the list of characters to be substituted is specified in the Tgif.PSCharSubs_TOKEN  X
       default.   The  format  for  Tgif.PSCharSubs_TOKEN  is  a  list  of OLDCHARCODE/NEWCHARNAME strings where
       OLDCHARCODE is a character code in decimal or octal  format  and  NEWCHARNAME  must  be  the  name  of  a
       PostScript character.  In the above example, <u>Foo</u> was used as the TOKEN name.  In real use, something like
       <u>iso8895-2</u>  may  be  more  appropriate  for  a  TOKEN name.  Since decimal or octal codes are allowed, the
       following is equivalent to the above:

              Tgif.PSFontNeedCharSubs: \n\
                      Utopia-Regular=iso8859-2 \n\
                      Utopia-Bold=iso8859-2 \n\
                      Utopia-Italic=iso8859-2 \n\
                      Utopia-BoldItalic=iso8859-2
              Tgif.PSCharSubs_iso8859-2: \n\
                      161/Aogonek \n\
                      8#306/Cacute \n\
                      8#312/eogonek

       Please note that substitution <u>only</u> occurs for  characters  with  character  codes  between  161  and  255
       (inclusive).

</pre><h4><b>SQUARE</b> <b>DOUBLE</b> <b>BYTE</b> <b>FONTS</b></h4><pre>
       Starting  with  version  4.0 of tgif, double-byte fonts are supported.  But only double-fonts where every
       character has the same width and  height  are  supported.   Double-byte  fonts  is  specified  using  the
       Tgif.SquareDoubleByteFonts  X  default.   The  format  of  this  X  default  is  similar  to  that of the
       Tgif.AdditionalFonts X default described in the ADDITIONAL FONTS section above with differences described
       here.  Each double-byte font requires <u>4</u> parts, one for each font style (in  the  order  of  Roman,  Bold,
       Italic, and BoldItalic).  Each part contains <u>3</u> strings.  The first string specifies the name of the font.
       It  must  contain a "%d" as part of the string.  The actual X font used will be the specified string with
       "%d" replaced by the font size.  The second string can be either "*", "H", or "V".  When it  is  the  "V"
       string,  each  character  is  rotated  90  degrees  counter-clockwise.  Otherwise, the characters are not
       rotated.  The third string specifies the PostScript font name.

       Using input methods (specified by the Tgif.DoubleByteInputMethod X default) one can mix english  (single-
       byte)  substrings within a double-byte string.  The font to use for the english substring is specified by
       the Tgif.DefaultSingleByteFont X default.

       For example, if one wants to use the X Song Ti font to represent PostScript GB-Song-Regular font, one can
       set Tgif.SquareDoubleByteFonts as follows:

       Tgif.DefaultSingleByteFont: Helvetica
       Tgif.GBShowFontChar: 271372 Tgif.GBConvFromUTF8: iconv -f utf8 -t  gb2312  Tgif.GBUConvToUTF8:  iconv  -f
       gb2312 -t utf8
       Tgif.SquareDoubleByteFonts: \n\
              -isas-song ti-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-gb2312.1980-0 \n\
                      * \n\
                      GB-Song-Regular \n\
              \n\
              -isas-song ti-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-gb2312.1980-0 \n\
                      * \n\
                      GB-Song-Regular \n\
              \n\
              -isas-song ti-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-gb2312.1980-0 \n\
                      * \n\
                      GB-Song-Regular \n\
              \n\
              -isas-song ti-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-gb2312.1980-0 \n\
                      * \n\
                      GB-Song-Regular

       In the above example, the Song Ti font doesn't have styles such as italic and bold, so all four parts are
       identical.   The  Tgif.GBShowFontChar  X  default  specifies  a double-byte octal character to be used to
       represent this font in the Choice Window when this font is selected.  The Tgif.GBUConvFromUTF8 X  default
       specifies a command to run when an UTF8-encoded string is to be pasted into a text object in the GB font.
       The  Tgif.GBUConvToUTF8  X  default  specifies a command to run in a copy operation to convert a selected
       string (in GB font) to the UTF8 format then copied to the clipboard.

       Below is another example of using the X JIS fonts to represent PostScript Ryumin-Light-EUC-H and  Ryumin-
       Light-EUC-V fonts as follows:

       Tgif.RyuminShowFontChar: 244242
       Tgif.SquareDoubleByteFonts: \n\
              -jis-fixed-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-* \n\
                      H \n\
                      Ryumin-Light-EUC-H \n\
              -jis-fixed-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-* \n\
                      H \n\
                      Ryumin-Light-EUC-H \n\
              -jis-fixed-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-* \n\
                      H \n\
                      Ryumin-Light-EUC-H \n\
              -jis-fixed-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-* \n\
                      H \n\
                      Ryumin-Light-EUC-H \n\
              \n\
              -jis-fixed-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-* \n\
                      V \n\
                      Ryumin-Light-EUC-V \n\
              -jis-fixed-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-* \n\
                      V \n\

                      V \n\
                      Ryumin-Light-EUC-V

       are supported.  In <u>stacked</u> layout mode, pages are considered to be stacked on  top  of  each  other,  and
       therefore,  an object can only appear on one page.  In <u>tiled</u> layout mode, pages are tiled to form a large
       logical page; in this case, an object can exist  on  several  physical  pages  simultaneously.   Swiching
       between  the  two  modes are considered rare events and can not be undone.  Tgif does not allow switching
       from the tiled layout mode to the stacked mode when there exists  an  object  that  spans  physical  page
       boundaries because it can not decide which physical page the object belongs.

       Page  numbers  are  supported  through  the use of page numbering objects.  A page number objecting is an
       object that contains an attribute whose name is <u>!PAGE_NUM</u> (the name is case-sensitive) and the name  part
       of  that attribute is not shown (hiding an attribute name can be achieved by using the Move/JustifyAttr()
       command under the Attribute submenu of the Special Menu).  The value of the attribute determines how  the
       page  number  is  printed.   If the value of the attribute contains a <u>!(STACKED_PAGE_NUM)</u> substring, that
       part of the substring will be replaced by the page number if the page layout mode  is  <u>stacked</u>.   If  the
       page  layout mode is tiled, the string will be printed out as is.  If the value of the attribute contains
       a <u>!(STACKED_NUM_PAGES)</u> substring, that part of the substring will be replaced by the number of  pages  if
       the  page  layout  mode  is  <u>stacked</u>.   If  the  value  of  the attribute contains a <u>!(TILED_PAGE_ROW)</u> or
       <u>!(TILED_PAGE_COL)</u> substring, that part of the substring will be replaced by the row number or the  column
       number of the physical page if the page layout mode is <u>tiled</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       There  are a few special attributes that tgif recognized.  There are described in this section.  They are
       all case-sensitive.

       !PAGE_NUM=&lt;page_number&gt;
              This specifies the page numbers in a multipage drawing.  Please see the MULTIPAGE DRAWING  section
              for details.

       auto_center_attr
              If an attribute's name is empty and the value is <u>auto_center_attr</u>, then all the visible attributes
              of  the  owner  object  will  automatically  be centered relative to the bounding box of the owner
              object.  It doesn't really make sense to  have  multiple  visible  attributes  because  they  will
              overlap.  This attribute is useful for making simple flowchart elements.

       unmakeiconic_on_instantiate
              If   a   symbol   object's   attribute   has   an   empty   attribute   name   and  the  value  is
              <u>unmakeiconic_on_instantiate</u>, then when the symbol is  instantiated,  the  following  commands  are
              performed  on  the just-instantiated icon object: 1) UnMakeIconic() command from the Special Menu,
              2) UnGroup() command from the Arrange Menu, and 3) the "unmakeiconic_on_instantiate"  text  object
              is removed.  This attribute is useful for making simple flowchart segments.

       unmakeiconic_on_instantiate_delete_attrs
              If   a   symbol   object's   attribute   has   an   empty   attribute   name   and  the  value  is
              <u>unmakeiconic_on_instantiate_delete_attrs</u>, then when the  symbol  is  instantiated,  the  following
              commands  are  performed  on the just-instantiated icon object: 1) UnMakeIconic() command from the
              Special Menu, 2) delete all attributes from this object, and 3) UnGroup() command from the Arrange
              Menu.  This attribute is useful for putting a group of "useful" objects into a symbol object.

       retracted_arrows
              If an attribute's name is empty and the value is <u>retracted_arrows</u> for a  polyline  or  open-spline
              object with more than 2 vertices, then the arrows of the spline object is retracted by one vertex.

       auto_retracted_arrows
              This  is very similar to the <u>retracted_arrows</u> above except that the object must be an interpolated
              open-spline with only one arrow head.  The spline object is forced to  have  3  vertices  and  the
              middle vertex of the spline object is automatically adjusted when an endpoint is moved.

       auto_exec=&lt;internal_command&gt;
              If such a file attribute exists, the value is executed when the file is opened (unless the file is
              opened as a result of executing the hyperjump_then_exec() internal command).

       edit_attrs_in_context_menu=...
              If  an object has an attribute named <u>edit_attrs_in_context_menu</u>, the values (starting from the 2nd
              line and separated by linebreaks) of this attribute are treated as  attribute  names.   The  named
              attributes  will  be  visible  in  the  Edit Attribute In Editor submenu of the Context Menu.  For
              example, if an object has the following attributes:

                     edit_attrs_in_context_menu=
                            x
                            y
                            z
                     w=greetings
                     x=hello
                     y=world
                     z=how are you
                     good-bye

              the Edit Attribute In Editor submenu of the Context Menu will only show "x=hello", "y=world",  and
              "z=how are you".

</pre><h4><b>EXPORT</b> <b>TO</b> <b>TABLE</b></h4><pre>
       When  the  ExportToTable()  command  is  selected  from  the  Table  submenu of the Special Menu, certain
       attributes of selected objects are written into a user-specified output file in a  format  which  can  be
       easily  imported  by a spreadsheet program or to be used by the MergeWithTable() command described in the
       next section.  An output file contains columns of strings.  Two columns are separated by a  single  &lt;TAB&gt;
       character.  The first row of a output file contains the column names and all other rows contain values.

       The names of the attributes to be written are specified by the <u>file</u> <u>attribute</u> named <u>TABLE_ATTRS</u> (which is
       denoted by <u>!.TABLE_ATTRS</u> here).  The value of the TABLE_ATTRS file attribute is a list of comma-separated
       attribute   names.    When  ExportToTable()  command  is  executed,  the  attribute  names  specified  by
       !.TABLE_ATTRS are written to the output file first.  Then, for each selected object,  every  one  of  its
       attribute  which  appears  in  the  list specified by !.TABLE_ATTRS are written to the output file in one
       line.  If an object has no attributes that match the specification, no corresponding line is generated.

</pre><h4><b>MERGE</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>TABLE</b></h4><pre>
       When the MergeWithTable() command is selected from the Table submenu of  the  Special  Menu,  a  selected
       object  is  <u>merged</u> (also known as <u>mail-merged</u> on PCs) with a table (data) file (in the same format as the
       output file described in the previous section) to generate a new multipage  drawing  having  the  <u>stacked</u>
       page layout mode.

       The  selected  object  contains formating information, and it is also used as a template to be replicated
       for each data row in the table file.  If an attribute of the replica  matches  the  column  name  of  the
       table,  the  attribute  value is set to the value in the table file.  The replicas are tiled horizontally
       first.

       Eight attributes must be specified in the template object.  They are all case-sensitive.  The  ones  that
       measure  distances  can  be  specified  in inches ("in"), centi-meters ("cm"), or pixels (if no units are
       specified).

              <u>PAPER_WIDTH</u>
                     This specifies the width of the paper.

              <u>PAPER_HEIGHT</u>
                     This specifies the height of the paper.

              <u>LEFT_MARGIN</u>
                     This specifies the distance to the left edge of the paper.

              <u>TOP_MARGIN</u>
                     This specifies the distance to the top edge of the paper.

              <u>H_PITCH</u>
                     This specifies the distance between the left edges of the replicas.

              <u>V_PITCH</u>
                     This specifies the distance between the top edges of the replicas.

              <u>NUM_COLS</u>
                     This specifies the number of replicas to tile horizontally before moving down to  the  next
                     row.

              <u>NUM_ROWS</u>
                     This specifies the number of replicas to tile vertically before moving to the next page.

       After  each  replica  is  generated,  filled with the data from the table file, and placed, its attribute
       named <u>exec</u> is executed (unless an attribute named <u>EXEC_AFTER_MERGE</u>  is  specified,  in  which  case,  the
       attribute  named  by the <u>EXEC_AFTER_MERGE</u> attribute is executed instead).  If there is no attribute named
       by the <u>EXEC_AFTER_MERGE</u> attribute, nothing is executed.  (Please see the INTERNAL  COMMANDS  section  for
       details  on  command  execution.)   One  can  use the <u>exec</u> command to construct other attributes from the
       attributes associated with the data table.

       If an attribute whose name is empty and whose value is the string <u>USER_PLACEMENT</u>, the user will be  asked
       to  place  the  replica  (object  name  will  be  displayed in the Status Window when the object is being
       placed).  In this case, the 8 placement related attributes are ignored.

       If an attribute whose name is empty and whose  value  is  the  string  <u>STRIP_DOUBLE_QUOTES</u>,  data  fields
       surrounded by double-quotes are stripped.

</pre><h4><b>MIME</b> <b>TYPES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>MAILCAPS</b></h4><pre>
       When an URL names an HTTP server, the HTTP server sends the <u>Content-type</u> of the URL along with the remote
       file  referenced  by  the URL to tgif.  The <u>Content-type</u> contains information such as the type/subtype of
       the file plus some optional fields.  If the file is not a tgif file, the following mechanism is  used  to
       view the file.

       First, the X defaults are looked up to see if there is an external viewer specified for the file.  Please
       see Tgif.@@@Viewer in the X DEFAULTS section below for details.  If there's no match, the type/subtype is
       matched  against  entries  in  the MIME-types file.  The default MIME-types file is <u>.mime.types</u> in user's
       home directory.  Please see Tgif.MimeTypesFile in the X DEFAULTS section on how to override  the  default
       MIME-types file.  The first field in each line of the MIME-types file specifies type/subtype information.
       If there is a type/subtype match in the MIME-types files, the MailCap files are consulted as follows.

       A  line  in  a  MailCap  file consists of fields separated by semi-colons.  The first field specifies the
       type/subtype and the second field  specifies  a  <u>view</u>  <u>command</u>  for  viewing  a  file  that  matches  the
       type/subtype.   For  tgif,  the  view command must contains a single <u>%s</u> substring to be replaced by local
       copy of the URL.  Only the <u>%t</u> and the <u>%{}</u> optional fields are supported by tgif.  The <u>multipart</u> MIME-type
       is not supported.  The type/subtype information of the remote file is matches against the MailCap  files.
       If  a  match is found, the corresponding view command is executed.  If no match is found, but the type of
       the remote file is either <u>application</u>, <u>audio</u>, <u>image</u>, or <u>video</u>, the file is saved and no  external  viewer
       is launched.  Otherwise, the remote file is assumed to be pure text and tgif will create a text object to
       view the text.

       The  MailCap  files  are  the  (colon-separated)  files specified by the MAILCAP environment variable (if
       defined).  If MAILCAP is not defined, the <u>.mailcap</u> file in the user's home directory is used.

       MIME is the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions specified in  RFC1521,  and  MAILCAP  is  specified  in
       RFC1524.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>MAKE</b> <b>A</b> <b>BUILDING-BLOCK</b> <b>OBJECT</b> <b>(SYMBOL</b> <b>FILE)</b></h4><pre>
       Here are the steps for defining a building-block object, to be used in a hierarchical design.

       1)     Draw  the  representation  part  of the building-block object.  Group everything together.  Select
              this grouped object.

       2)     Popup the main menu with the middle mouse button;  select  ``Special''.   Select  ``MakeSymbolic''
              from the next popup menu.  The selected object becomes a symbol and gets a dashed boundary.

       3)     Type  in attributes as individual text strings.  Select the symbol object and all the text strings
              to be attached to the symbol.  Type #a (for <u>Attach</u>) to attach attributes to the symbol.

       4)     (This step is optional.)  Build the definition part of the building-block  object.   Look  at  the
              ``flip-flop.sym''  file  for an example.  To look at that file, first, instantiate a ``flip-flop''
              by typing ^i (for <u>Instantiate</u>).  Select the flip-flop from the popup window; place the  flip-flop;
              select the flip-flop and type #v (for <u>Push</u>) to see the symbol file.

       5)     Save  and name the file.  If the current library path contains the current directory (or '.'), the
              symbol just built should be instantiatable by typing ^i.

</pre><h4><b>X11</b> <b>PIXMAP</b> <b>(XPM)</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       Tgif can only import X11 pixmaps that satisfy the constraints described here.   The  format  of  the  X11
       pixmap  must  be either 1 (XPM1) or 3 (XPM3).  Only a subset of the XPM3 format is supported, namely, the
       <u>key</u> field for the color specification must be 'c' (for color visuals).  Tools that generate  XPM1  format
       files  are (they might have been upgraded to support XPM3), <u>pbmplus</u> (or <u>netpbm</u>), which is a set of bitmap
       and pixmap conversion freeware (together with <u>xv</u>, the colors for pixmap objects can be manipulated),  and
       <u>xgrabsc</u>,  another freeware; also, <u>xloadimage</u> can display XPM1 files.  Tools that can generate XPM3 format
       files are, for example, <u><a href="../man1/xsnap.1.html">xsnap</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/sxpm.1.html">sxpm</a></u>(1).  For each color specified in the color string, a color cell
       is allocated.  If the allocation fails, the current color will be used for that  color  string.   If  the
       first  color  character  is a back-quote (`) or a space, then the corresponding color is substituted with
       the <u>background</u> color of the tgif window if the Tgif.GuessXPmBgColor X default is set to ``true''.   (This
       design  choice  is  made  because the pixmap will then look ``right'' on both regular and reverse video.)
       The following is an example of a very small pixmap file (in XPM1 format).

              #define arrow_format 1
              #define arrow_width 5
              #define arrow_height 3
              #define arrow_ncolors 3
              #define arrow_chars_per_pixel 1
              static char *arrow_colors[] = {
                 "`", "Black",
                 "a", "red",
                 "b", "yellow"
              };
              static char *arrow_pixels[] = {
              "`a```",
              "aabbb",
              "`a```"
              };

</pre><h4><b>LATEX</b> <b>FIGURE</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       Here we show how to make a figure for a LaTeX file, first with the <u>\psfig</u> (or <u>\epsf</u>)  special  construct,
       then  with  the  <u>psfile</u>  special  construct.   (The  author does not recommend the <u>psfile</u> construct.)  An
       example of both can be found in ``example.tex'' which is included with the tgif distribution.

       To print a tgif file to be included in a LaTeX document with the <u>\psfig</u> or <u>\epsf</u> special construct (files
       generated will be in the <u>Encapsulated</u> <u>PostScript</u> format), first select LaTeX format in the  panel  window
       (click  the  left  mouse  button  on  the  laser printer icon), then type ^p to generate the Encapsulated
       PostScript file.  If the file name is ``an-sr-flip-flop.obj'', then the LaTeX figure file generated  will
       be named ``an-sr-flip-flop.eps''.  This file can be included in a LaTeX document as follows,

              \input{psfig}
              \begin{figure*}[htb]
              \centerline{\psfig{figure=an-sr-flip-flop.eps}}
              \caption{An SR flip-flop.  \label{fig:an-sr-flip-flop}}
              \end{figure*}

       An alternative way is to use the <u>\epsf</u> construct as follows,

              \input{epsf}
              \begin{figure*}[htb]
              \centerline{\epsffile{an-sr-flip-flop.eps}}
              \caption{An SR flip-flop.  \label{fig:an-sr-flip-flop}}
              \end{figure*}

       The  \centerline  command  above  centers  the  picture.  If one has multiple tgif figures in one's LaTeX
       document, one only have to include the psfig macro (\input{psfig} or \input{epsf}) once, right after  the
       \begin{document} statement.

       If  Encapsulated PostScript is not available, the <u>psfile</u> special construct can be used as described here.
       In this case, since LaTeX doesn't not know where the bounding box  of  the  drawing  is,  it  takes  some
       practice to get this just right.  Here is something that seems to work.  First, center the picture on the
       page (e.g., the width of a portrait style page is 8.5 inch, so the center of the page is at the 4.25 inch
       mark),  and  make the top object in the picture about 1/4 inch away from the top of the page.  Select the
       LaTeX format in the panel window, then print in the LaTeX format.  As with the <u>psfig</u>  construct,  a  file
       with the <u>.eps</u> extension will be generated.  This file can be included in a LaTeX document as follows,

              \begin{figure*}[htb]
              \special{psfile="an-sr-flip-flop.eps" hoffset=-40}
              \rule{0in}{1.1in}
              \caption{An SR flip-flop.  \label{fig:an-sr-flip-flop}}
              \end{figure*}

       The  \rule{0in}{1.1in}  above specifies an invisible box of 1.1 inches high, which is the total height of
       the picture in an-sr-flip-flop.

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTING</b> <b>OBJECTS</b></h4><pre>
       In the world of E-CAD, an icon object can represent  an  electronic  component  and  a  line  object  can
       represent  a connection between a pair of pins of two electronic components.  When a component moves, the
       endpoint of a wire connecting to the component will also move with the component.  Tgif  simulates  these
       functionalities in a limited fashion.

       In  tgif,  a  connection is represented by matching signal names.  A wire is defined as a polyline object
       having a <u>type=tgWire</u> attribute and an attribute named <u>signal_name</u>.  The  definition  of  a  <u>pin</u>  is  more
       complicated.   It  is  described  in  the  next  paragraph.   If  two  pins have identical values for the
       <u>signal_name</u> attribute, they are considered to be connected (they do not have to be visually connected  by
       a wire).

       A  <u>pin</u>  object  must  have  a <u>type=port</u> attribute and attributes named <u>signal_name</u> and <u>name</u>.  But not all
       objects having such attributes are pins.  In addition, a pin object must be either:

       (1)    a top-level symbol or an icon object

       or:

       (2)    an immediate subobject of a <u>owner</u> symbol or icon object.  or:

       (3)    an immediate subobject of a <u>owner</u> grouped object which has a <u>type=tgBroadcastWire</u> attribute.

       In (2) above, the <u>owner</u> object must also have an attribute named <u>name</u> and must  <u>not</u>  be  a  subobject  of
       another  symbol  or  icon  object.   If  the  <u>owner</u>  object  is a subobject of a grouped object, the <u>name</u>
       attributes of the grouped object will be ignored.

       In (3) above, that grouped object can be created using the ConnectPortsToBroadcastWire() command  in  the
       PortsAndSignals  submenu  of  the  Special Menu when a polyline object and some floating port objects are
       selected.

       A <u>pin</u> object can have a connected view and a disconnected view.  A connected view is a subobject  with  a
       <u>view=conn,FILL,PEN</u>  attribute  and  a  disconnected  view  is  a  subobject  with a <u>view=disconn,FILL,PEN</u>
       attribute; FILL and PEN are numeric values between 0  and  31  (inclusive).   The  value  corresponds  to
       patterns  in the Fill Menu and the Pen Menu.  Normally, only 0 or 1 should be used.  When the <u>signal_name</u>
       attribute of a pin object is changed from an empty string to a non-empty string, the pen and fill of  the
       subobject  that corresponds to the disconnected view will be set to 0 (meaning NONE) and the pen and fill
       of the subobject that corresponds to the connected view will be set to the values specified in  the  <u>view</u>
       attribute  of  the connected view.  When the <u>signal_name</u> attribute of a pin object is changed from a non-
       empty string to an empty string, the pen and fill of the subobject that corresponds to the connected view
       will be set to 0 and the pen and fill of the subobject that corresponds to the disconnected view will  be
       set to the values specified in the <u>view</u> attribute of the disconnected view.

       A  connection  can be created using the ConnectTwoPortsByAWire() command from the PortsAndSignals submenu
       of the Special Menu.  Please note that if a pin is part of another object, that object must also  have  a
       <u>name</u>  attribute  with a non-empty value.  When two pins are connected using this command, the <u>signal_name</u>
       attributes of the pins and the wire will be set to have the same value.

       The moving of endpoints when a component moves is implemented in tgif using  the  constrained  move  mode
       from  the  MoveMode  Menu  (please  see  Tgif.ConstrainedMove  in  the  X DEFAULTS section for additional
       information).  Please note that a connected wire that is not visually connected  will  not  automatically
       extends  itself  to  follow  a  connected component even in the constrained move mode.  Also, when a wire
       object is deleted, the <u>signal_name</u> attributes of connected pins do not change (since they are not  really
       "connected").

              The default is off.

       <u>Tgif.InitialFont:</u> <u>[Times,Courier,Helvetica,NewCentury,Symbol]</u>
              This specifies the initial font.  The default is Courier.

       <u>Tgif.InitialFontStyle:</u> <u>[Roman,Bold,Italic,BoldItalic]</u>
              This specifies the initial font style.  The default is Roman.

       <u>Tgif.InitialFontJust:</u> <u>[Left,Center,Right]</u>
              This specifies the initial font justification.  The default is Left.

       <u>Tgif.InitialFontSize:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the size of the start-up font.  The default is 14.  An alternative form allows "pt"
              to be specified immediately after NUMBER (with no space between "pt" and the NUMBER).

       <u>Tgif.MsgFontSizeIndex:</u> <u>[0,1,2,3,4,5]</u>
              <u>Obsoleted</u>.

       <u>Tgif.MsgFontSize:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>

              14.

       <u>Tgif.RulerFontSize:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the size of the font used for ruler windows.  The default is 10.

       <u>Tgif.DefaultFontSize:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the size of the font to be used when a requested for a font size can not satisfied.

              not in the specified font sizes.

       <u>Tgif.AdditionalFonts:</u> <u>FONT_SPEC1</u> <u>FONT_SPEC2</u> <u>...</u>
              In  addition  to the Times, Courier, Helvetica, NewCentury, and Symbol fonts, additional fonts can
              be specified here.  Please see the ADDITIONAL FONTS section for details.

       <u>Tgif.FontNamePrefix:</u> <u>[-*</u>, <u>*</u>]
              This specified the prefix to be used when tgif makes a request to the X server.   The  default  is
              <u>-*</u>.   Certain fonts have obscure font names (e.g., does not start with the <u>-</u> character).  In order
              to use these fonts, this X default can be set to <u>*</u>.

       <u>Tgif.DefaultLatin1FontCharEncoding:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              Tgif uses 4 default fonts, "times", "courier", "helvetica",  and  "new  century  schoolbook".   By
              default,  the  character  encoding for these fonts is iso8859-1.  These fonts are usually scalable
              and pre-installed in older Linux systems.  In newer Linux system, this  is  no  longer  the  case.
              Only a small number of font sizes are pre-installed.  The pre-installed scalable versions of these
              fonts  are  iso10646-1 (Universal Character Set) encoded.  This X default can be used to specify a
              different character encoding (such as iso10646-1) for the 4 default fonts.  This  X  default  does
              not  apply  to  alternate  default fonts or fonts specified by the Tgif.AdditionalFonts X default.
              The default is iso8859-1.

       <u>Tgif.HasAlternateDefaultFonts:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              The default value of this X default is false.  If it is set to ``false'', tgif  uses  the  iso8859
              registry    with    ASN1    encoded    screen    fonts    (unless    it's    overridden   by   the
              Tgif.DefaultFontCharEncoding X default), and it looks for "times",  "courier",  "helvetica",  "new
              century schoolbook", and "symbol" as part of the screen font names.  Some X servers do not support
              these  fonts.  In this case, this X default can be used to make tgif use user specified screen and
              PostScript fonts.  If this X default is set to ``true'', tgif will look for additional X  defaults
              of the form <u>Tgif.&lt;ps_font_name&gt;</u>, where <u>&lt;ps_font_name&gt;</u> can be one of the following strings:

                     Times-Roman
                     Times-Bold
                     Times-Italic
                     Times-BoldItalic
                     Courier
                     Courier-Bold
                     Courier-Oblique
                     Courier-BoldOblique
                     Helvetica
                     Helvetica-Bold
                     Helvetica-Oblique
                     Helvetica-BoldOblique
                     NewCenturySchlbk-Roman
                     NewCenturySchlbk-Bold
                     NewCenturySchlbk-Italic
                     NewCenturySchlbk-BoldItalic
                     Symbol

              The  corresponding  value  of  the X default must contain "%d" as part of the string, and the "%d"
              string will be replaced by the font size when the font is requested.  For example,  The  following
              lines  will  use  the  Times  New  Roman  screen font instead of the Times screen font and use the
              Bookman PostScript font instead of the Times PostScript font, if Tgif.HasAlternateDefaultFonts  is
              ``true'':

              Tgif.Times-Roman: *-times new roman-medium-r-*--%d-*,Bookman-Light
              Tgif.Times-Bold: *-times new roman-bold-r-*--%d-*,Bookman-Demi
              Tgif.Times-Italic: *-times new roman-medium-i-*--%d-*,Bookman-LightItalic
              Tgif.Times-BoldItalic: *-times new roman-bold-i-*--%d-*,Bookman-DemiItalic

              Please note that certain X servers require the right-hand-side font specifications to have all the
              dashes in place.

       <u>Tgif.DefaultCursor:</u> <u>[x_cursor,arrow,...]</u>
              This  specifies  the  select  cursor.   Entries in &lt;X11/cursorfont.h&gt; (without the XC_ prefix) are
              valid names of the cursor.  The default is arrow.

       <u>Tgif.DrawCursor:</u> <u>[x_cursor,arrow,...]</u>
              This specifies the cursor used when drawing objects.  Entries in &lt;X11/cursorfont.h&gt;  (without  the
              XC_ prefix) are valid names of the cursor.  The default is the same as Tgif.DefaultCursor.

       <u>Tgif.DragCursor:</u> <u>[x_cursor,arrow,...]</u>
              This  specifies  the  cursor  used  when dragging.  Entries in &lt;X11/cursorfont.h&gt; (without the XC_
              prefix) are valid names of the cursor.  The default is hand2.

       <u>Tgif.VertexCursor:</u> <u>[x_cursor,arrow,...]</u>
              This specifies the cursor used  in  the  select  vertices  mode.   Entries  in  &lt;X11/cursorfont.h&gt;
              (without the XC_ prefix) are valid names of the cursor.  The default is plus.

       <u>Tgif.FreeHandCursor:</u> <u>[x_cursor,arrow,...]</u>
              This  specifies  the cursor used in freehand drawing mode.  Entries in &lt;X11/cursorfont.h&gt; (without
              the XC_ prefix) are valid names of the cursor.  The default is pencil.

       <u>Tgif.RubberBandColor:</u> <u>COLORSTRING</u>
              This specifies the color to be used for rubber-banding (XORing).  The default color is the same as
              the foreground color.

       <u>Tgif.MaxColors:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the maximum number of colors.  Color0 through ColorMax, where Max is NUMBER-1, in X
              defaults are queried.  If NUMBER is greater than the default of 11, Color11 through ColorMax  <u>must</u>
              all  exist  in  X  defaults.   Please  see the GRAPHICAL OBJECTS section for a list of the default
              colors.

       <u>Tgif.Color#:</u> <u>COLORSTRING</u>
              This specifies the correspondence between a color number and a color.

       <u>Tgif.DefaultColorIndex:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the default color index if a certain color can not be found.   The  default  is  0.
              Please note Tgif.DefaultColor takes precedence over this X default.

       <u>Tgif.ShortCuts:</u> <u>ITEM1</u> <u>ITEM2</u> <u>...</u>
              The ITEM specifies the correspondence between a key (may be case sensitive) and a non-alphanumeric
              key command.  Please see the SHORTCUTS section for details.

       <u>Tgif.MaxLineWidths:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This  specifies  the  maximum number of line widths.  LineWidth0 through LineWidthMax, ArrowWidth0
              through ArrowWidthMax, and ArrowHeight0 through  ArrowHeightMax,  where  Max  is  NUMBER-1,  in  X
              defaults  are  queried.   If  NUMBER  is  greater  than the default value of 7, LineWidth7 through
              LineWidthMax, ArrowWidth7 through ArrowWidthMax, and ArrowHeight7 through ArrowHeightMax <u>must</u>  all
              exist  in  X defaults.  Some default values will be used for those that are not specified in the X
              defaults.

       <u>Tgif.DefaultLineWidth:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the initial line width <u>index</u>.  The default is 0.

       <u>Tgif.LineWidth#:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies a line width.  The default line widths are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

       <u>Tgif.ArrowWidth#:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the width (when the arrow is pointing horizontally) of the arrow head for  arc  and
              open-spline objects.  The default arrow widths are 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 20, and 22.

       <u>Tgif.ArrowHeight#:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This  specifies  <u>half</u>  the height (when the arrow is also pointing horizontally) of the arrow head
              for arc and open-spline objects.  The default arrow heights are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

       <u>Tgif.MaxDomains:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies that NUMBER is the number of domains.  DomainPath0,DomainPath1,...,DomainPathM  all
              must exist in X defaults.  Here M=NUMBER-1.

       <u>Tgif.DomainPath#:</u> <u>DOMAINSTRING</u>
              This  specifies the correspondence between a domain number, a domain name, and the path associated
              with a domain.  Hence one DomainPath# X default is required for each domain defined.  Here  the  #
              should be replaced with a domain number.  The domain numbers should be 0,1,...,MAXDOMAINS-1, where
              MAXDOMAINS  is  set in the MaxDomain X default above.  The MaxDomain X default in combination with
              the DomainPath# X default are required to use domains.

              DOMAINSTRING contains strings which are separated by the ':' symbol.  The first string is the name
              of the domain.  Each of the rest of the strings specifies a directory where symbol files are to be
              searched when the Instantiate command is executed (please see the HOW  TO  MAKE  A  BUILDING-BLOCK
              OBJECT  section  for  details).   Another  way  to  look at the DOMAINSTRING specification is that
              removing the first string  (which  specifies  the  domain  name)  and  the  first  ':'  symbol,  a
              DOMAINSTRING  has  the  form of the <u>PATH</u> <a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a>(1) environment variable.  For example, to specify the
              symbol path for domain  <u>DEFAULT</u>  to  look  for  symbol  files,  first  in  the  library  directory
              /tmp/tgif/symbols,  then  in  the  current  directory, DOMAINSTRING should be set to the following
              value:

                     DEFAULT:/tmp/tgif/symbols:.

       <u>Tgif.DefaultDomain:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the default domain when tgif starts up.  The default is 0.

       <u>Tgif.PrintCommand:</u> <u>COMMAND</u>
              This specifies the print command used for printing the PostScript file.  The  default  is  <a href="../man1/lpr.1.html">lpr</a>(1).
              An  example  would  be  <u>lpr</u>  <u>-h</u> <u>-Pprintername</u>.  If COMMAND contains a <u>%s</u> substring, the <u>%s</u> will be
              replaced by the full path name of the PostScript file which is normally sent to the print command.
              Therefore, COMMAND without a <u>%s</u> substring behaves identically to <u>COMMAND</u>  <u>%s</u>.   Please  note  that
              this  only  works  when  running tgif without the -print command line option.  This can be used to
              send a font file to the printer before the tgif PostScript  file  is  sent  as  in  the  following
              example:

                     cat /somewhere/sansfex.pfa %s | lpr -Pmyprinter

       <u>Tgif.WhereToPrint:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              This  specifies  the  initial  print/export  destination/format.   STRING can be Printer, EPS, PS,
              Bitmap, Text, EPSI, GIF, HTML, PDF, WinEPSI, PNG, JPEG, PPM, or NetList.  The default is EPS.

       <u>Tgif.PrintDirectory:</u> <u>PATH</u>
              This specifies the print directory when the output destination is not the printer.  The default is
              a null string, which means that the output goes into the  directory  in  which  the  current  file
              resides.

       <u>Tgif.NoTgifIcon:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to  ``true'',  tgif  will not use its own icon window.  In this case, one should also set
              Tgif.UseWMIconPixmap described below to true.  Modern window managers  usually  do  not  allow  an
              application  to  draw  its  own  icon  window, so this X default would have no effect when tgif is
              running under these window managers.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.UseWMIconPixmap:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', tgif will use  the  standard  icon  pixmap.   Also,  Tgif.NoTgifIcon  will  be
              ignored.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.DontShowVersion:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', the tgif version will not be displayed on top of the tgif window.  The default
              is true.

       <u>Tgif.XBmReverseVideo:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to  ``true'',  an  invert bitmap operation will be performed when importing an X11 bitmap
              file.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.AskForXBmSpec:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', the user will be asked to specify magnification and geometry for an X11 bitmap
              file being imported.  Format of the specification is <u>MAG=WxH+X+Y</u>, where MAG is the  magnification,
              W  and  H  specifies the width and height, and the location specification can be +X+Y, +X-Y, -X+Y,
              and -X-Y.  The '=' is mandatory if any of the geometry information is specified.  The  default  is
              false.

       <u>Tgif.AskForXPmSpec:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', the user will be asked to specify magnification and geometry for an X11 pixmap
              file  being  imported.   The  format  of  the specification is the same as for AskForXBmSpec.  The
              default is false.

       <u>Tgif.StripEPSComments:</u> <u>(obsolete)</u>
              This X default became obsolete in tgif-4.0.11 because it turns out that it's not  always  okay  to
              strip PS comments (it should always be set to false).

       <u>Tgif.GuessXPmBgColor:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set to ``true'', then when tgif imports an X11 pixmap file with the first color string being '
              ' (the space character) or '`' (the back quote character), it will treat  the  first  color  as  a
              <u>background</u>  color.   This means that the specified color in the X11 pixmap file will be changed to
              the current background color.  The default is false.  (Please note  that  this  default  was  <u>true</u>
              before  patch  2  of  tgif-2.7.   This  X default is there for compatibility reasons; it should be
              considered obsolete.)

       <u>Tgif.XPmOutputVersion:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the XPM version number when outputting in the X11 pixmap format.  NUMBER  can  take
              on values 1 or 3.  The default is 1.

       <u>Tgif.XPmInXGrabSCFormat:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If Tgif.XpmOutputVersion is set to 1, setting this to ``true'' will force the X11 pixmap output to
              resemble what xgrabsc generates (i.e., color names will not be used).  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.UseGrayScale:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to  ``true'',  gray  scales  will  be used for tiling patterns to speed up printing.  The
              default is false.

       <u>Tgif.AutoPanInEditText:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', auto panning will be used such that the text cursor is always visible in  text
              edit mode (except when the cursor is to the left or on top of the paper).  This should probably be
              turned off on slow servers.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.PercentPrintReduction:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the initial percent print reduction/magnification.  The default is 100.

       <u>Tgif.ConstrainedMove:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              This  specifies  the initial move mode.  When set to ``true'', moving or stretching an object will
              cause the endpoints of all polylines or open-splines, whose endpoints fall within the object,  and
              may  be  the  neighboring  vertices,  to be moved.  Please see the IDIOSYNCRASIES section for more
              details.  The default value is false.

       <u>Tgif.DoubleQuoteDoubleQuote:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              When set to ``true'', output of the double-quote character will  be  preceded  by  a  double-quote
              character;  when  set  to  false, output of the double-quote character will be preceded by a back-
              slash character.  The default value is false.

       <u>Tgif.GridSystem:</u> <u>[English,Metric]</u>
              This sets the initial grid system.  The default is English.

       <u>Tgif.InitialGrid:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the initial grid size.  For the English grid system, NUMBER can be -2, -1,  0,  +1,
              or  +2  for  grid sizes of 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 inch.  For the Metric grid system, NUMBER
              can be -1, 0, +1, or +2 for grid sizes of 1mm, 2mm, 5mm, and 1cm.  The default value is 0.

       <u>Tgif.DropObsIconAttrWhenUpdate:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', obsolete icon  attributes  will  be  dropped  without  confirmation  when  the
              UpdateSymbols  command  is  executed.  If set to ``false'', a popup window will prompt the user to
              specify what to do with the obsoleted icon attributes.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.UseRecentDupDistance:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', the most recent change in position produced by a combination  of  a  duplicate
              and  a  move command will be used for the new duplicate command.  Otherwise, some default distance
              will be used to position the duplicate.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.SplineTolerance:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the tolerance of spline drawing.  The smaller the number, the smoother the  spline.
              The default is 9 (min is 3 and max is 13).

       <u>Tgif.SplineRubberband:</u> <u>(obsolete)</u>
              If  set  to ``true'', spline rubber-bands will be used in drawing, moving, and stretching open and
              closed splines.  (This might not be desirable if the spline  contains  too  many  vertices.)   The
              default  is true.  This X default became obsolete since tgif-4.2 due to the addition of structured
              spline objects.

       <u>Tgif.Synchronize:</u> <u>[on,off]</u>
              XSynchronize is called if this X default is set to ``on''.  The default is off.

       <u>Tgif.DoubleClickUnIconify:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', double mouse clicks are used to de-iconify the icon window (in this mode,  the
              icon window ignores single mouse clicks and drags).  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.MainMenuPinDistance:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This  specifies the horizontal distance (in pixels) the user needs to drag a popup menu before the
              popup menu is to be pinned down.  The default is 80.  (If pinned popup menus are not desired, then
              this should be set to a value greater than the screen width.)  Dragging the left mouse button  can
              be used to move the pinned popup menu; clicking the right button in the popup menu will remove it.

       <u>Tgif.DoubleClickInterval:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This  specifies  the maximum interval (in milliseconds) between two mouse clicked to be recognized
              as one double-click.  The default is 300.

       <u>Tgif.HandleSize:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies (half) the size of the handle used to highlight objects.  Its  allowable  value  is
              between 2 and 6.  The default is 3.

       <u>Tgif.HistoryDepth:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This  specifies  the  size  of  the  undo/redo  buffer;  negative  values  mean that the buffer is
              unbounded.  The default is -1.

       <u>Tgif.SaveTmpOnReturn:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', a tmpmodel file will be saved automatically before returning  to  the  driver.
              Otherwise, no files will be saved automatically.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.ImportFromLibrary:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', the library directories specified by the current domain are searched for .obj,
              .sym,  xbitmap/xpixmap, and EPS files to import.  Otherwise, the current directory will be used as
              the starting point.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.WarpToWinCenter:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', the mouse is warped to the center of popup windows.  Otherwise, the  mouse  is
              not warped.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.SaveCommentsInSaveNew:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set to ``true'', "%%" type comments in the file will be stored in the newly created file.  The
              default is true.

       <u>Tgif.CanvasWindowOnly:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', only the canvas window will be displayed (this  is  a  kind  of  the  ``demo''
              mode).  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.UsePsAdobeString:</u> <u>[true,false,NUMBER_1/NUMBER_2]</u>
              If  set  to  ``true'', the first line in the PS or EPS file will be "%!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF-1.2".  If
              set to ``false'', it is just "%!".  If the PS-Adobe string confuses the document manager (such  as
              Transcript)  on  your  site, you should set it to ``false''.  If the third form is used, the first
              line will be "%!PS-Adobe-NUMBER_1 EPSF-NUMBER_2".  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.HalfToneBitmap:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', the Floyd-Steinberg half-tone method will be used when  printing  in  the  X11
              bitmap  format.   This  is  useful  when  the drawing contains X11 pixmap objects.  The default is
              false.

       <u>Tgif.ThresholdBitmap:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', a simple thresholding method will be used to decide whether a bit is turned on
              or off when printing in the X11 bitmap format.  If Tgif.HalfToneBitmap is  set  to  true,  this  X
              default is ignored.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.BitmapThreshold:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This  specifies  the threshold value used in either the Floyd-Steinberg half-tone algorithm or the
              simple thresholding algorithm.  NUMBER must be between 0 and 1.  This X  default  is  only  active
              when  either  the  Tgif.HalfToneBitmap  or the Tgif.ThresholdBitmap X default is set to true.  The
              default value is 0.5 if Tgif.HalfToneBitmap is true, and is 1.0 if  Tgif.ThresholdBitmap  is  true
              (basically, anything that is not white will be black).

       <u>Tgif.EPSIThresholdPreviewBitmap:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', a simple thresholding method will be used to decide whether a bit is turned on
              or off in the preview bitmap when printing in the EPSI format.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.EPSIPreviewBitmapThreshold:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This  specifies  the threshold value used in the simple thresholding algorithm to decide whether a
              bit is turned on or off in the preview bitmap when printing in the EPSI format.   NUMBER  must  be
              between  0 and 1.  The default value is 0.5 if Tgif.EPSIThresholdPreviewBitmap is true, and is 1.0
              if Tgif.EPSIThresholdPreviewBitmap is false (basically, anything that is not white will be black).

       <u>Tgif.GroupedTextEditable:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``false'', only top level text objects and attributes of top level objects can be edited
              when the drawing mode is set to the text mode.  If set to ``true'', text  objects  and  attributes
              everywhere can be edited.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.DefaultEPSScaling:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This  specifies  the  scaling  factor applied to an imported PS or EPS image.  As mentioned in the
              IDIOSYNCRASIES section below, tgif treats 128 pixels as an inch and PostScript treats 72 points as
              an inch.  In order to have real-size PostScript images, this parameter should  be  set  to  1.7778
              (which is 128/72).  The default value is 1.

       <u>Tgif.IntrCheckInterval:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This  specifies  the number of objects drawn before tgif checks for interrupts.  If this is set to
              be 0 or less, interrupt is not allowed.  The default value is 10.

       <u>Tgif.TiledPageScaling:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the scaling value used when a multipage drawing in  tiled  page  mode  is  printed.
              Since  most  PostScript printers do not use the full page as the drawing area, setting this number
              to 1 may get truncated output.  The default value is 0.9.

       <u>Tgif.TGIFPATH:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              This specifies the directory where the files, mentioned in the FILES section below, can be  found.
              The TGIFPATH environment variable may override this option.  The default value is specified by the
              compiler option TGIF_PATH.

       <u>Tgif.TGIFICON:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              This  specifies  the name of the object file to be displayed when tgif is iconified.  If it starts
              with a / character, absolute path is used;  otherwise,  the  actual  path  of  the  icon  file  is
              $TGIFPATH/STRING where TGIFPATH is either defined using the X defaults or an environment variable.
              The default value is ``tgificon.obj''.

       <u>Tgif.StickyMenuSelection:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to  ``true'', when patterns/linewidths/linestyles/... of objects are changed using a menu
              action, the corresponding pattern/linewidth/linestyle/...  becomes  the  current  selection.   The
              default is true.

       <u>Tgif.PSBopHook:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              If  specified,  the following PostScript line is added at the beginning of each page when printing
              to the printer or to a PS file,

                     userdict /STRING known { STRING } if

              This option should only be used if one is very  familiar  with  PostScript.   (Setting  STRING  to
              "tgif-bop-hook"  is  recommended  since  it would not have a name conflict with existing software,
              such as <a href="../man1/dvips.1.html">dvips</a>(1).)

       <u>Tgif.PSEopHook:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              If specified, the following PostScript line is added at the end of each page when printing to  the
              printer or to a PS file,

                     userdict /STRING known { STRING } if

              This  option  should  only  be  used  if one is very familiar with PostScript.  (Setting STRING to
              "tgif-eop-hook" is recommended since it would not have a name  conflict  with  existing  software,
              such as <a href="../man1/dvips.1.html">dvips</a>(1).)

       <u>Tgif.MinimalEPS:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to  ``false'',  comments  such as %%Pages, %%DocumentFonts, %%EndComments, %%BeginProlog,
              %%EndProlog, %%Page, %%Trailer, and %%EOF will be generated in an EPS output.  These comments  may
              confuse certain ``document managers''.  Therefore, the default is true if Tgif.UsePsAdobeString is
              not specified (and the default is false if Tgif.UsePsAdobeString is specified).

       <u>Tgif.InitialPrintInColor:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', color output (printing) mode is enabled on startup.  Please note that in black
              and  white  PS/EPS/EPSI  printing  mode, the <u>white</u> color will be printed as black (only <u>background</u>
              will be printed as white).  The default is true (except when the <b>-print</b>  command  line  option  is
              used).

       <u>Tgif.InitialShowGrid:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``false'', showing grid is disabled on startup.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.InitialSnapOn:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``false'', snapping to the grid points is disabled on startup.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.NoMenubar:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', no menubar will be shown initially.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.NoStatusWindow:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', no Status Window will be shown initially.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.ReverseMouseStatusButtons:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set to ``true'', the left mouse status and the right mouse status are swapped.  This should be
              used when a ``left-handed mouse'' is used.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.MinimalMenubar:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``false'', the menu items in the Menubar Window will be the same as the main popup menu.
              This would take up much more  space.   If  set  to  ``true'',  the  Page,  PageLayout,  HoriAlign,
              VertAlign, and MoveMode menus are collapsed into the View cascading menu; the Font, TextStyle, and
              TextSize  menus are collapsed into the Text cascading menu; and the LineDash, LineStyle, LineType,
              LineWidth, Fill, and Pen menus are collapsed into the Graphics cascading  menu.   The  default  is
              true.

       <u>Tgif.ColorBgInPrintingColorPS:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to  ``true'', the window background color is used as the background color when generating
              color PostScript output.  If set to ``false'', no background color is used.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.ScrollBarWidth:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the width of a scroll bar.  NUMBER must be between 2 and 16.  The default is 16.

       <u>Tgif.InitialPaperSize:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies the initial width and height of the paper.   STRING  is  in  the  "&lt;width&gt;  x
              &lt;height&gt;"  form.   &lt;width&gt;  and  &lt;height&gt;  is  a numeric value immediately followed by either "in"
              (inch) or "cm" (centi-meter).  The " x " that separate the &lt;width&gt; and &lt;height&gt; is mandatory.   If
              A4PAPER  is  defined  in  the  Makefile,  the default value is "21cm x 29.7cm".  If A4PAPER is not
              defined in the Makefile, the default value is "8.5in x 11in".

       <u>Tgif.UpdateChildUsingAlignment:</u> <u>[true,false,no_overlap]</u>
              If  set  to  ``true''   or   'no_overlap',   when   update_eps_child(),   update_xbm_child(),   or
              update_xpm_child()  internal  command  is executed, the current horizontal and vertical alignments
              are used to place the EPS/XBM/XPM subobject.  If the horizontal alignment is L, C, R, S, or -, the
              subobject is aligned to the left, center, right, center, or  left,  respectively,  to  the  parent
              object.   If  the  vertical  alignment is T, M, B, S, or -, the subobject is placed above, middle,
              below, middle, or below the parent object if this X default is set to 'no_overlap'; the  subobject
              is aligned to the top, middle, bottom, middle, or below the parent object if this X default is set
              to  ``true''.   If  this  X  default is set to ``false'', the subobject is placed left aligned and
              below the parent object.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.GenerateImageMap:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', NCSA <u>imagemap</u> or CERN <u>Clickable</u> <u>Image</u> files will be generated  when  print  in
              GIF  format.   In  this  case,  Tgif.XpmToGif,  Tgif.ImageMapFileExtension, Tgif.GifFileExtension,
              Tgif.ImageMapFileFormat, and Tgif.UseXPmVersion1ForImageMap X defaults, described below,  will  be
              interpreted; otherwise, they are ignored.  Please see the section on GENERATING IMAGEMAP FILES for
              details.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.XpmToGif:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies a command used to convert an XPM file to a GIF file.  The STRING <u>must</u> contain
              a  <u>%s</u> substring to be replaced by the full path name of the XPM file.  The default is "xpmtoppm %s
              | ppmtogif".

       <u>Tgif.ImageMapFileExtension:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies the file extension for a imagemap file.  The default is "map".

       <u>Tgif.GifFileExtension:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies the file extension for a GIF file.  The default is "gif" (lower case).

       <u>Tgif.ImageMapFileFormat:</u> <u>[NCSA,CERN]</u>
              The STRING specifies either the NCSA imagemap or the CERN clickable image format.  The default  is
              NCSA for the NCSA imagemap format.

       <u>Tgif.UseXPmVersion1ForImageMap:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              The  setting  of this X default should depend on the setting of the Tgif.XpmToGif X default above.
              If set to ``true'', XPM1 file is generated regardless of the setting of the  Tgif.XPmOutputVersion
              X default.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.UsePaperSizeStoredInFile:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set to ``true'', the paper size information stored in a just opened file is used.  The default
              is true.

       <u>Tgif.OneMotionSelMove:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', one can select and move an object in one motion.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.TiffEPSI:</u> <u>(obsolete)</u>
              This X default became obsolete because TiffEPSI became a supported export format since tgif-4.0.

       <u>Tgif.XbmToTiff:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies a command used to convert an XBM file  to  a  TIFF  file.   The  STRING  <u>must</u>
              contain either one or two <u>%s</u> substring.  The first <u>%s</u> substring is to be replaced by the full path
              name of the XBM file.  The optional second <u>%s</u> substring is to be replaced by the full path name of
              the generated TIFF image.  The default is "xbmtopbm %s | pnmtotiff -none &gt; %s".

       <u>Tgif.EPSIExportExtension:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              STRING specifies the file extension used for exporting <u>EPSI</u> files.  The default is "eps".

       <u>Tgif.HotListFileName:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              STRING  specifies  a  full  path name of a file used to store the hot file list.  By default, this
              file is .Tgif_hotlist in the user's home directory.

       <u>Tgif.@@@Viewer:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              STRING specifies an external viewer for an remote URL with a file extension of @@@.  STRING can be
              in 3 forms.  It can be the string "NONE" to indicate that when such a remote file is  encountered,
              tgif  should  retrieve  the  file  into a user specified directory.  For example, if one wishes to
              retrieve .gz files, one can use:

                     Tgif.gzViewer: NONE

              STRING can also contain the string %S (S is capitalized), this indicates that %S is to be replaced
              by the URL.  For example, if one wishes to view .html files using xmosaic, one can use:

                     Tgif.htmlViewer: xmosaic %S

              Another form of STRING contains the string %s (S is lower-case), this indicates  that  the  remote
              file  is  to be retrieved into a user specified directory and view by a tool.  For example, if one
              wishes to view .gif files using xv, one can use:

                     Tgif.gifViewer: xv %s

              Please note that this mechanism has precedence over the mechanism described in the MIME TYPES  AND
              MAILCAPS section above.

       <u>Tgif.AutoHyperSpaceOnRemote:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set to ``false'', tgif will not go into the <u>hyperspace</u> mode when a remote URL is visited.  The
              default is true.

       <u>Tgif.AllowLaunchInHyperSpace:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', launching of applications is enabled in the <u>hyperspace</u> mode when a remote  URL
              is  visited.   This  is  potentially  very  dangerous  because the application may do catastrophic
              damages.  Therefore, it is strongly recommended that it is set to false.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.CanChangeAttrColor:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', color of an attribute can be changed when it is attached to  an  object.   The
              default is false.

       <u>Tgif.MimeTypesFile:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              STRING  specifies  a full path name of the MIME-types file.  Tgif only uses the type/subtype field
              in the MIME-types file and ignores all other fields.  The default MIME-types file  is  <u>.mime.types</u>
              in user's home directory.

       <u>Tgif.LocalRGBTxt:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              If  one  would  like  to override certain system colors, one can use STRING to specify a full path
              name of a file to be consulted first before looking up the color in the server.  The file must  be
              in  the  same format as the <u>rgb.txt</u> file.  Namely, each line contains 4 fields, the first 3 fields
              correspond to the red, green, and blue components of the color, and the 4th field is the  name  of
              the color.  A color component must have a value between 0 and 255 (inclusive).

       <u>Tgif.PrintUsingRequestedColor:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to ``true'', the color PostScript file being printed will use the <u>requested</u> color instead
              of the color returned by the X server.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.ShowMeasurement:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', the location of the cursor and the  width  and  height  of  the  object  being
              drawn/dragged/stretched will be shown.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.ShowMeasurementUnit:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The  STRING specifies the unit used to display the measurement cursor.  There are 2 basic formats.
              One is just the word "pixel", "inch", or "cm".  There are also  known  as  basic  units.   Another
              format  is  NUM  BASIC-UNIT/NEW-UNIT, where NUM is a numeric value, BASIC-UNIT is one of the basic
              units, and NEW-UNIT is any string.  For example, "0.1 cm/mm" means that the new  display  unit  is
              "mm"  and  1  "mm"  is  0.1  cm.   "50 pixel/cm" is identical to "1 cm/cm" and "128 pixel/inch" is
              identical to "1 inch/inch".  The default is pixel.

       <u>Tgif.PageStyleLandscape:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', tgif comes up in landscape mode.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.QueryZoomInPoint:</u> <u>[true,false]</u> <u>or</u> <u>[always,no_select,no_query,never]</u>
              If set to ``true'' (or ``always''), the user will be asked to select a center point  when  zooming
              in.   If  set to ``no_select'', the user will be asked to select a center point when zooming in if
              no objects are selected.  If set to ``no_query'', the position of the mouse is the zoom-in  point.
              In  this  case,  it is not desirable to zooms in using a menu selection.  The default is false (or
              never).

       <u>Tgif.GZipCmd:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies a command used to gzip a .obj file.  The command <u>must</u> produce output into its
              stdout.  If the command contains a <u>%s</u> substring, the <u>%s</u> will be replace by the full path name of a
              temporary copy of the .obj file.  The default is "gzip -c".

       <u>Tgif.GUnZipCmd:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies a command used to unzip  a  zipped  tgif  file  (with  extension  .obj.gz  or
              .sym.gz)  into  a  tgif  file.   The  command <u>must</u> produce output into its stdout.  If the command
              contains a <u>%s</u> substring, the <u>%s</u> will be replace by the full path name of a temporary copy  of  the
              zipped file.  The default is "gunzip -c".

       <u>Tgif.HttpProxy:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The  STRING  specifies  a  host  name  and  a  port number of an HTTP proxy server.  Format of the
              specification is <u>&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</u>.  If <u>:&lt;port&gt;</u> is omitted, 80 is used as  the  default  port  number.
              The environment variable <u>http_proxy</u> has precedence over this X default.  The default is not to use
              an HTTP proxy server.

       <u>Tgif.FtpProxy:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The  STRING  specifies  a  host  name  and  a  port  number of an FTP proxy server.  Format of the
              specification is <u>&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</u>.  If <u>:&lt;port&gt;</u> is omitted, 21 is used as  the  default  port  number.
              The  environment variable <u>ftp_proxy</u> has precedence over this X default.  The default is not to use
              an FTP proxy server.

       <u>Tgif.InitialArrowStyle:</u> <u>[NONE,RIGHT,LEFT,DOUBLE]</u>
              This specifies the initial arrow style for polyline/open-splines/arcs.  The default is RIGHT.

       <u>Tgif.ShowPageInEPS:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', a <u>showpage</u> PostScript command will be generated for an EPS or EPSI file.   The
              default is true.

       <u>Tgif.MaxNavigateCacheBuffers:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This  specifies  the  number  of  cache  buffers  allocated  to  cache  remote  files (to minimize
              communication).  NUMBER must be non-negative.  The default is 40.

       <u>Tgif.NumberFileInPrintOnePage:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', when PrintOnePage from the Print Menu is  selected  for  a  stacked  multipage
              drawing  (e.g.,  file.obj),  file_<u>N</u>  with  the  proper  file  extension will be generated, where <u>N</u>
              corresponds to the selected page number.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.OneMotionTimeout:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              When Tgif.OneMotionSelMove is set to true, moving an object is considered to be making a selection
              if the elapse time between mouse-down and mouse-up is smaller than the timeout value specified  by
              this X default (in milliseconds).  The default is 200.

       <u>Tgif.MinMoveInterval:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              When  Tgif.OneMotionSelMove  is  set  to  false,  moving  an  object  is considered to be making a
              selection if the elapse time  between  mouse-down  and  mouse-up  is  smaller  than  the  interval
              specified by this X default (in milliseconds).  The default is 0.

       <u>Tgif.GifToXpm:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies a command used to convert a GIF file to an XPM file.  The STRING <u>must</u> contain
              a  <u>%s</u> substring to be replaced by the full path name of the GIF file.  The default is "giftopnm %s
              | ppmtoxpm".

       <u>Tgif.InitExportPixelTrim:</u> <u>LEFT_NUMBER,TOP_NUMBER,RIGHT_NUMBER,BOTTOM_NUMBER</u>
              The numbers specify the number of pixels to trim when printing or exporting in the  XBM,  XPM,  or
              GIF  format.   The  use of these values forms an escape mechanism to fix an idiosyncrasy that tgif
              can not figure out exactly how big the whole image is.  The default values are all 0's.

       <u>Tgif.QuantizingLevels:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              Some image functions such as Sharpen() uses convolution and may generate an image that  uses  more
              than  256 colors which tgif can not handle.  The NUMBER specifies the number of colors to quantize
              down to when such a situation occurs.  The default is 222.

       <u>Tgif.RotateCursor:</u> <u>[x_cursor,arrow,...]</u>
              This specifies the cursor used in the rotate mode.  Entries in &lt;X11/cursorfont.h&gt; (without the XC_
              prefix) are valid names of the cursor.  The default is crosshair.

       <u>Tgif.ColorLayers:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', each color is considered to be a different layer  which  can  be  individually
              turned  on  and  off.  If a color layer is turned off, primitive objects in that layer will not be
              visible.  A grouped object only becomes invisible when all its constituent objects are  invisible.
              The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.TiffToXbm:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The  STRING  specifies a command used to convert a TIFF file to an XBM file.  This command is used
              when importing an EPSI file generated by a Windows application.  The  STRING  <u>must</u>  contain  a  <u>%s</u>
              substring  to  be replaced by the full path name of the TIFF file.  The default is "tifftopnm %s |
              pgmtopbm | pbmtoxbm".

       <u>Tgif.DefFixedWidthFont:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies a font to be  used  as  the  default  font  for  the  Status  Window,  menus,

       <u>Tgif.DefFixedWidthRulerFont:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The  STRING specifies a font to be used in the horizontal and vertical ruler windows.  The default
              is "-*-courier-medium-r-normal-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1".

       <u>Tgif.MenuFont:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies a font to be used in menus.  If this X default is not specified, the  default
              font is used in menus.

       <u>Tgif.BoldMsgFont:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The  STRING specifies a bold font to be used in buttons and dialogboxes.  If this X default is not
              specified but Tgif.MenuFont is specified, this will take on the value of Tgif.MenuFont.  If this X
              default and Tgif.MenuFont are not specified, the default font is used in bold messages.

       <u>Tgif.MsgFont:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies a thin font to be used in the Status  Window  and  dialogboxes.   If  this  X
              default is not specified, the default font is used in messages.

       <u>Tgif.BggenToXpm:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies a command for generating an X11 pixmap file to be executed when RunBggen() is
              selected  from the ImageProc Menu.  The STRING <u>must</u> contain two <u>%s</u> substrings.  The first <u>%s</u> is to
              be replaced by a user specified string.  The second <u>%s</u> is to be replaced by the  geometry  of  the
              image.   The  default  is "bggen %s -g %s | ppmquant 64 | ppmtoxpm".  Please note that <a href="../man1/bggen.1.html">bggen</a>(1) is
              part of the <a href="../man1/xv.1.html">xv</a>(1) package.

       <u>Tgif.BggenToPpm6:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies a command for generating a  PPM  file  to  be  executed  when  RunBggen()  is
              selected  from the ImageProc Menu.  The STRING <u>must</u> contain two <u>%s</u> substrings.  The first <u>%s</u> is to
              be replaced by a user specified string.  The second <u>%s</u> is to be replaced by the  geometry  of  the
              image.  The default is "bggen %s -g %s".  Please note that <a href="../man1/bggen.1.html">bggen</a>(1) is part of the <a href="../man1/xv.1.html">xv</a>(1) package.

       <u>Tgif.LittleEndianPpm6:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to  ``true'', when reading a PPM (or PGM) file that uses a maxval of 65535, little endian
              format will be assumed (the standard for such a format calls for  the  big  endian  format).   The
              default is false.

       <u>Tgif.DefaultErrorDiffuseLevels:</u> <u>R_NUMBER</u> <u>G_NUMBER</u> <u>B_NUMBER</u>
              The   NUMBERs   specify   the   number   of  bits  of  red,  green,  and  blue  to  be  used  when
              ReduceToDefaultColors() or DefaultErrorDiffuse() are selected  from  the  ImageProc  Menu.   These
              values   determine   a  set  of  default  colors  to  be  used  for  color  quantization  for  the
              ReduceToDefaultColors() and DefaultErrorDiffuse()  methods.   R_NUMBER+G_NUMBER+B_NUMBER  must  be
              less than or equal to 8, and each number must be greater than 0.  The default is 2 2 2.

       <u>Tgif.MaxImportFilters:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the maximum number of import filters.  ImportFilter0 through ImportFilterMax, where
              Max is NUMBER-1, in X defaults are queried.  The default is 0.

       <u>Tgif.ImportFilter#:</u> <u>FILTERSTRING</u>
              This  specifies  an import filter.  FILTERSTRING has 3 parts (separated by space characters).  The
              first part is the name of the filter.  It must not contain a space  character.   The  second  part
              contains  semicolon-separated  file  extensions.   The third part is the actual filter command for
              converting the named external file type to an X11 pixmap  file.   Please  see  the  IMPORT  RASTER
              GRAPHICS section for details.

       <u>Tgif.ShowFileNameOnBrowse:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to  ``true'',  file  names  will  be  shown  when  BrowseXBitmap(),  BrowseXPixmap(),  or
              BrowseOther() are selected from the File Menu.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.HtmlFileExtension:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies the file extension used when printing in the HTML  format.   The  default  is
              "html".

       <u>Tgif.GenerateHtmlHref:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'' and when printing in the HTML format, the value of an <u>href</u> attribute is parsed.
              If  the value references a .obj file, it's changed to have a HTML file extension.  If it is set to
              ``false'', no conversion will be performed.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.RotationIncrement:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the initial rotation increment in degrees.  The default is 45.

       <u>Tgif.PSA4PaperSize:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'' and A4 size paper is specified, the following line is added  to  a  PS/EPS/EPSI
              file (before "%%EndComments"):

                     %%DocumentPaperSizes: a4

              The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.ShapeShadowSpec:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The  STRING  specifies  the  initial  horizontal  and vertical offsets of a shape shadow.  If both
              values are zeroes, a shape is created without a shadow.  When creating  a  shape  with  a  shadow,
              background  fill pattern (3rd pattern in the first column of the Fill Menu) usually gives the best
              result.  The default is "0,0".

       <u>Tgif.StretchableText:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', stretchable text mode is the initial mode.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.EditTextSize:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the text size to be used in editing existing text objects.  NUMBER should either be
              0 or a value between 4 and 34 (inclusive).  If NUMBER is 0,  the  actual  text  size  is  used  in
              editing  existing text objects.  The value of the edit text size can later be changed by selecting
              SetEditTextSize() from the Properties Menu.  The default is 0.

       <u>Tgif.IconPixmap:</u> <u>(obsolete)</u>
              This X default became obsolete in tgif-4.2 because it clashes with the Xtoolket.  It's renamed  to
              Tgif.WMIconPixmap.

       <u>Tgif.WMIconPixmap:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              STRING  specifies  the  path  of  an XBM or XPM file to be used as tgif's desktop icon.  If STRING
              starts with a / character, absolute path is used; otherwise, the actual path of the icon  file  is
              $TGIFPATH/STRING where TGIFPATH is either defined using the X defaults or an environment variable.
              This  X  default  is  only  enabled  if  Tgif.UseWMIcon  is  set  to  true.   The default value is
              ``tgificon.xbm'' (which is compiled into tgif).

       <u>Tgif.TmpFileMode:</u> <u>NUMBER</u> <u>(OCTAL)</u>
              This specifies file mode for temporary and exported files.  NUMBER must be an  octal  number.   If
              NUMBER is 0, no attempt is made to change the file mode.  If this value is specified (even if it's
              0), it overrides the PSFILE_MOD compile option.  There is no default value.

       <u>Tgif.TitledPinnedMenu:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to ``true'', pinned menu will have a title bar and left button is used for selecting menu
              items in a pinned menu.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.ColorFromXPixmap:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              STRING specifies the path of an XPM file to be used to load the initial colors.  If this X default
              is specified, the Tgif.Color# X defaults are ignored but Tgif.AdditionalColors X  default  can  be
              used to specify additional colors when tgif starts up.

       <u>Tgif.VectorWarpSoftness:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This  specifies  the  softness  value  used when VectorWarp() is selected from the ImageProc Menu.
              VectorWarp() lets the user warp pixels in an X11 pixmap object by specifying a vector.   The  size
              of  the affected area is controlled by this value, which must lie between 1.0 and 4.0.  The larger
              the value, the larger the affected area.  The default value is 2.0.

       <u>Tgif.ChangePropertiesOfAttrs:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', changing a property (such as font, font size, color, etc.)  of an object  will
              change  the  property  of  the  attributes attached to the object in the same way.  The default is
              false.

       <u>Tgif.ShiftForDiagMouseMove:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', certain mouse movements are restricted to multiple of 45 degrees.  The default
              is true.

       <u>Tgif.UseRecentForDiagMouseMove:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', the object that is used as anchor for measuring the moving distance is used as
              an   anchor   when    objects.     This    only    works    if    Tgif.UseRecentDupDistance    and
              Tgif.ShiftForDiagMouseMove are both set to true, The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.FlushColormapOnOpen:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to ``true'', colormap is flushed and the initial tgif colors are reloaded when a new file
              is opened.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.TransparentPattern:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', fill and pen patterns are transparent initially.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.DontReencode:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              For fonts that are not iso8859-1 encoded, non-ASCII portion of the font (characters with bit 7 on)
              is by default reencoded as if it were iso8859-1 encoded.  If this is not  desirable  for  a  font,
              reencoding  can be bypassed by including the first part of the PostScript font name of the font in
              STRING.    Fields   in   STRING   are   colon-separated.     For    example,    if    STRING    is
              "Times:Courier:Helvetica",  PostScript  fonts  that begins with "Times", "Courier", or "Helvetica"
              will not be reencoded.  (Please note  that  this  X  default  overwrite  the  fonts  specified  by
              -D_DONT_REENCODE  at  compile  time.)   Please  also  see  the  POSTSCRIPT  CHARACTER ENCODING FOR
              INTERNATINOAL CHARACTERS section for an example.

       <u>Tgif.AdditionalDontReencode:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              Use this X default to augment Tgif.DontReencode (or the fonts  specified  by  -D_DONT_REENCODE  at
              compile time).  STRING here is basically concatenated to the STRING specified by Tgif.DontReencode
              (or the fonts specified by -D_DONT_REENCODE at compile time).

       <u>Tgif.UnsignedInXBmExport:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', <u>unsigned</u> <u>char</u> will be used instead of <u>char</u> in exported XBM files.  The default
              is false.

       <u>Tgif.CommentInBitmapExport:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to  ``true'', a blank <u>RCS</u> <u>Header</u> comment will be prepended to exported XBM and XPM files.
              The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.ShowFontSizeInPoints:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', font sizes are displayed in the unit of point sizes.  The default is false.

              The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.UseMeasureTooltip:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to  ``true'',  the  location  of  the cursor and the width and height of the object being
              drawn/dragged/stretched will be shown in a tooltip window.  This X default only  takes  effect  if
              Tgif.ShowMeasurement is true.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.MeasureTooltipXFollowMouse:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set to ``true'', the X position of the measurement tooptip will follow the mouse.  The default
              is false.

       <u>Tgif.MeasureTooltipYFollowMouse:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', the Y position of the measurement tooptip will follow the mouse.  The  default
              is false.

       <u>Tgif.MeasureTooltipHorizontalPosition:</u> <u>[left,center,right]</u>
              Fix  the X position of the measurement tooltip to the left, center, or right.  This X default only
              takes effect if Tgif.MeasureTooltipXFollowMouse is false.  The default is left.

       <u>Tgif.MeasureTooltipVerticalPosition:</u> <u>[top,middle,bottom]</u>
              Fix the Y position of the measurement tooltip to the top, middle, or bottom.  This X default  only
              takes effect if Tgif.MeasureTooltipYFollowMouse is false.  The default is top.

       <u>Tgif.MeasureTooltipVerbose:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to  ``true'',  additional  information  about  the positions and sizes of objects will be
              displayed in the tooltip window.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.NoMinWinSize:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``false'', tgif will have a minimum window size so that the whole panel window is always
              visible.  The problem with this setting is that some window manager will  show  the  wrong  window
              size  when  you  resize  the  window.   This setting is left for compatibility reasons.  If set to
              ``true'', a side effect is that the  menubar  will  no  longer  automatically  wraps  around  when
              Tgif.MinimalMenubar is set to true.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.AutoWrapMenubar:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set to ``true'', the menubar will automatically wrap around.  If Tgif.MinimalMenubar is set to
              false, menubar will always wrap around automatically.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.AutoEPSPreviewBitmap:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', when importing a PS/EPS file,  tgif  will  automatically  generate  a  preview
              bitmap if the file does not already contain one.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.PsToXbm:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              STRING  specifies  a  command  used to convert a PS file to a XBM file.  The STRING <u>must</u> contain a
              single <u>%s</u> substrings to be replaced by the full path name of the PS file.  Please  note  that  the
              above  command  usually  generates  a  bitmap  that's  much  larger  than image in the file.  Tgif
              automatically trims out the blank space similar to the way pbmtoepsi works.  The default is "gs -q
              -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pbm -sOutputFile=- -- "%s" | pbmtoxbm".

       <u>Tgif.TmpDirInHomeDir:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', tgif will use the $HOME/.Tgif directory as the temporary directory (unless the
              Tgif.TmpDir X default below is used) and the compiler option -DTMP_DIR is ignored.  The default is
              false if the -D_TMP_DIR_IN_HOME_DIR  compiler  option  is  used.   The  default  is  true  if  the
              -D_TMP_DIR_IN_HOME_DIR compiler option is <u>not</u> used.

       <u>Tgif.TmpDir:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              STRING  specifies a directory to be used as the temporary directory.  The use of this X default is
              discouraged, especially if tgif is compiled with -DUSE_XT_INITIALIZE and a X resource  file  found
              in  the  directory  search  path  specified  by the environment variable $XAPPLRESDIR is used.  By
              default, tgif uses <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> as the temporary directory.

       <u>Tgif.ThumbnailGeometry:</u> <u>WIDTHxHEIGHT</u>
              This X default specifies the geometry of thumbnails.  The default is 160x120.

       <u>Tgif.ThumbnailPadding:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the padding (in pixels) for thumbnail images.  The default value is 8.

       <u>Tgif.ThumbnailXGap:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the horizontal gap (in pixels) for thumbnail images.  The default value is 16.

       <u>Tgif.ThumbnailYGap:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the vertical gap (in pixels) for thumbnail images.  The default value is 0.

       <u>Tgif.ThumbnailX:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the starting x location (in pixels) for thumbnail images.  The default value is 32.

       <u>Tgif.ThumbnailY:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the starting y location (in pixels) for thumbnail images.  The default value is 32.

       <u>Tgif.ShowWireSignalName:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``false'', when connecting ports, tgif will automatically place the signal name and hide
              it.  Otherwise, the user will be prompted to place the signal name and it will  be  visible.   The
              default is true.

       <u>Tgif.LandscapePdfSetPageDevice:</u> <u>(obsolete)</u>
              This  X  default  became  obsolete  in  tgif-4.1.42  because  the  name is misleading.  Please see
              Tgif.PdfSetPageDevice below.

       <u>Tgif.PdfSetPageDevice:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', when exporting PDF (or PS) files, tgif  will  use  PostScript  "setpagedevice"
              command  to  specify  the paper size in the generated PostScript file before calling <a href="../man1/ps2pdf.1.html">ps2pdf</a>(1) (if
              exporting in PDF format).  This should not be necessary (and is considered a bug in  ps2pdf).   In
              the  future,  this X default can be used to turn off the generation of the "setpagedevice" command
              when ps2pdf can handle landscape PostScript files correctly.

       <u>Tgif.DeleteCmdAsCut:</u> <u>(obsolete)</u>
              This  X  default  became  obsolete  in  tgif-4.2.3.   Now  &lt;Cntrl&gt;x  binds  to  the  Cut  command.
              <u>Tgif.EnableMouseWheel:</u> <u>[true,false]</u> If set to ``false'', Button4 and Button5 mouse wheel scrolling
              events  will  be  ignored.   The  default is true.  <u>Tgif.Btn2PopupMainMenu:</u> <u>[true,false]</u> If set to
              ``false'', Button2 events will not bring up the Main Menu in the canvas window.   The  default  is
              true.

       <u>Tgif.NoChoiceWindow:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', no Choice and Message Windows will be shown initially.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.UseXPmVersion1ForXPmDeck:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              The  setting of this X default should depend on the setting of the Tgif.XpmDeckToGifAnim X default
              above.  If set to ``true'', XPM1 file is generated when a deck of  X11  pixmap  objects  is  being
              converted  to  a  GIF  animation  file  regardless  of  the setting of the Tgif.XPmOutputVersion X
              default.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.SlideShowWindowOffsets:</u> <u>X_OFFSET,Y_OFFSET</u>
              The numbers specify the number of pixels to adjust for the slideshow mode.  If only one  value  is
              given, both X and Y offsets are set to the same value.  The default values are all 0's.

       <u>Tgif.SlideShowBorderColor:</u> <u>COLORSTRING</u>
              This  specifies the color to be used for the area outside of the paper boundary in slideshow mode.
              By default, the color of the border is the same as the background color.

       <u>Tgif.ConvertToBezierSegments:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the number of segments used in converting a  polyline/spline  object  to  a  Bezier
              curve.  The default value is 50.

       <u>Tgif.TickMarkSize:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This  specifies  the  size  of  a  tick mark to be used when tick marks are added at a vertex of a
              polyline/polygon/spline.  The default value is 8.

       <u>Tgif.NoModeWindow:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', no Mode Window will be shown initially.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.MakeUnsavableInSlideShow:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', the current file will be made unsavable when slideshow mode is  entered.   (If
              the  current file contains auto page numbering objects, the file will be made unsavable regardless
              of the setting of this X default.)  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.SingleByteInputMethod:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              This specifies the input method for single-byte fonts.  Currently, only "xim" is supported.

       <u>Tgif.IgnoreSlideShowOffsetsInFile:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to  ``false'',  the  slideshow   offsets   stored   in   a   file   will   override   the
              Tgif.SlideShowWindowOffsets setting.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.ItalicMsgFont:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies a italic font to be used in some buttons.  If this X default is not specified
              but  Tgif.MenuFont  is specified, this will take on the value of Tgif.MenuFont.  If this X default
              and Tgif.MenuFont are not specified, the default font is used in italic messages.

       <u>Tgif.ItalicMsgFontSet:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              This X default is only used if tgif is compiled with the ENABLE_NLS compiler option.   The  STRING
              specifies  a  list of fonts to be used in messageboxes.  STRING can be ``none'' to indicate not to
              use    italic    message     font     set.      The     default     is     "-*-helvetica-medium-o-
              normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*,-*-*-medium-r-*--12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*".

       <u>Tgif.BoldItalicMsgFont:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The  STRING  specifies  a  bold  italic  font  to  be used in some text.  If this X default is not
              specified but Tgif.MenuFont is specified, this will take on the value of Tgif.MenuFont.  If this X
              default and Tgif.MenuFont are not specified, the default font is used in bold italic messages.

       <u>Tgif.BoldItalicMsgFontSet:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              This X default is only used if tgif is compiled with the ENABLE_NLS compiler option.   The  STRING
              specifies  a list of fonts to be used in some text.  STRING can be ``none'' to indicate not to use
              bold    italic     message     font     set.      The     default     is     "-*-helvetica-bold-o-
              normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*,-*-*-medium-r-*--12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*".

       <u>Tgif.ExternalPsToEpsi:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to ``true'', the execution of the pstoepsi() internal command will simply invoke pstoepsi
              externally.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.GsPath:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies a full path name of the gs (ghostscript) program.  The default is "gs" (which
              implies that the "gs" excutable is in your PATH).

       <u>Tgif.CompoundObjWithTextStretchableForPSE:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``false'', when executing the Precise Scale Everything command, a compound  object  will
              <b>not</b>  be  stretched  if it contains a text subobject.  This X default only has effect if tgif is in
              the non-stretchable text mode.  (If tgif is in the  stretchable  text  mode,  this  X  default  is
              ignored.)  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.HideWindowsInSlideShow:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to  ``false'', tgif will keep all windows visible in slideshow mode.  Otherwise, only the
              canvas window will be visible in slideshow mode.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.PSDistillerNoImageCompress:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', tgif will generate PostScript code so that images in  a  generated  PostScript
              file will <u>not</u> be compressed by a distiller program such as ps2pdf.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.AdditionalPSSetup:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              If  specified,  the  PostScript line specified by STRING is inserted at the end of PostScript file
              setup (right before %%EndSetup).  This option should only be used if one  is  very  familiar  with
              PostScript.  Here is an example to ask distiller programs not to compress bitmap images:

                     Tgif.AdditionalPSSetup: \n\
                         systemdict /setdistillerparams known \n\
                         { &lt;&lt; /AutoFilterGrayImages false \n\
                         /AutoFilterColorImages false \n\
                         /ColorImageFilter /FlateEncode \n\
                         /GrayImageFilter /FlateEncode \n\
                         &gt;&gt; setdistillerparams } if

       <u>Tgif.PSFontNeedCharSubs:</u> <u>FONTSUB_SPEC1</u> <u>FONTSUB_SPEC2</u> <u>...</u>
              The  format  of FONTSUB_SPEC is FONTNAME=TOKENNAME where FONTNAME is the name of a PostScript font
              and TOKENNAME is the name of the extension  for  the  Tgif.PSCharSubs_TOKENNAME  X  default.   For
              PostScript  font  names  that begins with a string that matches a FONTNAME part of a FONTSUB_SPEC,
              tgif will read the Tgif.PSCharSubs_TOKENNAME X default  to  determine  which  characters  will  be
              substituted.

              For fonts that are not iso8859-1 encoded, non-ASCII portion of the font (characters with bit 7 on)
              is  by  default reencoded as if it were iso8859-1 encoded when PS output is generated.  If this is
              not desired, different named PS characters can be  substituted  for  characters  with  bit  7  on.
              Please  also  see  the  POSTSCRIPT  CHARACTER ENCODING FOR INTERNATINOAL CHARACTERS section for an
              example.

       <u>Tgif.PSCharSubs_TOKENNAME:</u> <u>PSCHARSUBS_SPEC1</u> <u>PSCHARSUBS_SPEC2</u> <u>...</u>
              TOKENNAME must match a FONTSUB_SPEC in the Tgif.PSFontNeedCharSubs  X  default.   The  format  for
              PSCHARSUBS_SPEC  is  OLDCHARCODE/NEWCHARNAME where OLDCHARCODE is a character code in octal format
              and NEWCHARNAME is a PostScript character name to use.   For  more  information,  please  see  the
              POSTSCRIPT CHARACTER ENCODING FOR INTERNATINOAL CHARACTERS section.

       <u>Tgif.DrawTextFuncKey_F#:</u> <u>INTERNAL</u> <u>COMMAND</u> <u>LIST</u>
              This  specifies  the  correspondence between a function key and a list of internal commands.  When
              function key F# is pressed when tgif is in the  text  drawing  mode,  the  corresponding  list  of
              internal commands is executed.  Tgif only recognizes function keys F1 through F12.

       <u>Tgif.PasteFromXSelectionOnly:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``false'', if tgif has failed to perform a paste via the X Selections mechanism, it will
              attempt the old style paste (directly fetch bytes from the X server).  This is mainly used with an
              older X servers.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.PasteFromSelectionTimeout:</u> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This specifies the number of seconds for a paste operation to timeout.  The default value is 10.

       <u>Tgif.LengthLimit256InInsertChar:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to ``true'', the maximum number of characters per line of text is set at 256.  Additional
              characters are ignored.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.JpegToPpm6:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies a command used to convert a JPEG file to a PPM file in the  P6  format.   The
              STRING  <u>must</u>  contain  a  <u>%s</u> substring to be replaced by the full path name of the JPEG file.  The
              default is:

                     djpeg -ppm "%s"

       <u>Tgif.PngToPpm6:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies a command used to convert a PNG file to a PPM file in  the  P6  format.   The
              STRING  <u>must</u>  contain  a  <u>%s</u>  substring to be replaced by the full path name of the PNG file.  The
              default is:

                     pngtopnm "%s"

       <u>Tgif.ObjectShadowOffsets:</u> <u>X_OFFSET,Y_OFFSET</u>
              The numbers specify the number of pixels to be offseted when creating a generic object shadow.  If
              only one value is given, both X and Y offsets are set to the same value.  The default  values  are
              all 2's.

       <u>Tgif.ObjectShadowColor:</u> <u>COLORSTRING</u>
              This specifies the color to be used for generic object shadow.  The default value is "#c0c0c0".

       <u>Tgif.IgnoreObjectShadowInfoInFile:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to  ``false'',  the  generic object shadow information stored in a file will override the
              Tgif.ObjectShadowOffsets and Tgif.ObjectShadowColor settings.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.ReportMissingFonts:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', when tgif starts, missing X fonts  will  be  printed  to  the  terminal.   The
              default is false.

       <u>Tgif.CustomPatternDir:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              STRING  specifies  a  directory  that  contains custom fill and pen patterns.  Any valid XBM file,
              encoding a bitmap of arbitrary dimensions, name <b>pat</b><u>#</u><b>.xbm</b> <b>(for</b>  <b>3&lt;=</b>&lt;=31)  in  this  directory  will
              replace the corresponding default pattern .

       <u>Tgif.EnableTrueColorImages:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', on a TrueColor display, PPM and JPEG objects will use 24-bit color.  Tgif must
              be compiled with zlib support to enable this.  The default is true.

       <u>Tgif.AutoRotatePivot:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', user-specified rotation pivot will be disabled.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.RightMargin:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The  STRING  specifies  the  right  margin.   The  right margin must be specified with a unit (the
              choices are "pixel", "in", or "cm").  The default is "1 in" if Tgif.GridSystem  is  "English"  and
              "2.5 cm" if Tgif.GridSystem is "Metric".

       <u>Tgif.EnableRightMargin:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to  ``true'', a simple right-margin will be used when entering text.  This is not a full-
              featured right-margin.  It is only activated under the following conditions: text  object  is  not
              transformed,  text  is  left-justified, text cursor is not inside a superscript or a subscript, no
              zoome, and Tgif.EditTextSize is not used.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.NoOrientationIfPdfSetPageDevice:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', the  "%%Orientation:"  line  is  not  generated  in  the  PostScript  file  if
              "setpagedevice"  is  active  when  exporting  a PS/EPS/PDF file.  Please see Tgif.PdfSetPageDevice
              above.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.PNGExportHasTransparentColor:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', the color specified by the Tgif.PNGExportTransparentColor X  default  will  be
              made transparent when printing in the PNG format.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.PNGExportTransparentColor:</u> <u>COLORSTRING</u>
              This  specifies the color to be made transparent when printing in the PNG format.  By default, the
              default background color is used.

       <u>Tgif.PpmToPngWithTransparentColor:</u> <u>STRING</u>
              The STRING specifies a command used to convert a PPM file to a PNG file with a transparent  color.
              The  STRING <u>must</u> contain exactly two <u>%s</u> substring to be replaced by the transparent color and full
              path name of a PPM file.  The default is "pnmtopng -transparent '%s' '%s'".

       <u>Tgif.EnableThresholdFloodReplaceColor:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', threshold-based Flood Fill and Replace Color will be  used.   The  default  is
              false.

       <u>Tgif.FloodReplaceColorThreshold:</u> <u>RED_THRESH,GREEN_THRESH,BLUE_THRESH</u>
              In  threshold-based  Flood  Fill  and  Replace  Color, after a pixel is selected, pixels that have
              colors similar to the selected pixel will also change color.  The similarity is defined by these 3
              threshold values.  Each value must be between 0 and 255, inclusive.  The default  values  are  all
              15's.

       <u>Tgif.UseStdPalette8:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to  ``true'',  a  standard  8  palette  will be used as the startup colors.  These colors
              correspond to all 8 combination of 0x00 and 0xff in red, green, and  blue  color  components.   If
              this  X  default  is  used,  the Tgif.AdditionalColors X default can be used to specify additional
              colors when tgif starts up.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.UseStdPalette27:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', a standard 27-color palette will be used as the startup colors.  These  colors
              correspond to all 27 combination of 0x00, 0x80, and 0xff in red, green, and blue color components.
              If  this  X default is used, the Tgif.AdditionalColors X default can be used to specify additional
              colors when tgif starts up.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.UseStdPalette64:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', a standard 64-color palette will be used as the startup colors.  These  colors
              correspond  to  all  64  combination  of  0x00, 0x55, 0xaa, and 0xff in red, green, and blue color
              components.  If this X default is used, the Tgif.AdditionalColors X default can be used to specify
              additional colors when tgif starts up.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.UseStdPalette216:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If set to ``true'', a standard 216 palette will be used as the startup colors.  These  colors  are
              known  as  Mobile  Web-safe colors and they correspond to all 216 combination of 0x00, 0x33, 0x66,
              0x99, 0xcc, and 0xff in red, green, and blue color components.  If this X  default  is  used,  the
              Tgif.AdditionalColors X default can be used to specify additional colors when tgif starts up.  The
              default is false.

       <u>Tgif.UseMobileWebSafePalette:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              This is identical to Tgif.UseStdPalette216.

       <u>Tgif.UseOpenOfficeGalaxyPalette:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to ``true'', the OpenOffice Galaxy (53-color) palette will be used as the startup colors.
              If this X default is used, the Tgif.AdditionalColors X default can be used to  specify  additional
              colors when tgif starts up.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.UseOpenOfficeGooglePalette:</u> <u>[true,false]</u>
              If  set  to ``true'', the OpenOffice Google (80-color) palette will be used as the startup colors.
              If this X default is used, the Tgif.AdditionalColors X default can be used to  specify  additional
              colors when tgif starts up.  The default is false.

       <u>Tgif.AdditionalColors:</u> <u>COLOR1,</u> <u>COLOR2</u> <u>...</u>
              If     any    of    the    Tgif.ColorFromXPixmap,    Tgif.UseStdPalette8,    Tgif.UseStdPalette27,
              Tgif.UseStdPalette64,             Tgif.UseStdPalette216,             Tgif.UseMobileWebSafePalette,
              Tgif.UseOpenOfficeGalaxyPalette, or Tgif.UseOpenOfficeGooglePalette X defaults is used, additional
              startup  colors  can  be  specified  using  this  X  default.  Since color names can contain space
              characters, the colors must be separated by commas.

       <u>Tgif.DefaultColor:</u> <u>COLORSTRING</u>
              This specifies the default color if a certain color can not be found.  It has precedence over  the
              Tgif.DefaultColorIndex X default.  If this X default is not specified, Tgif.DefaultColorIndex will
              determine  the  default  color.   <u>Tgif.GifToPpm6:</u>  <u>STRING</u>  The  STRING specifies a command used to
              convert a GIF file to a PPM file in the P6 format.  The STRING <u>must</u> contain a <u>%s</u> substring  to  be
              replaced by the full path name of the GIF file.  The default is:

                     giftopnm "%s"

       <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLE</b>

       <u>TGIFPATH</u>
              This environment variable should be set such that the files, mentioned in the FILES section below,
              can be found.

       <u>TGIFICON</u>
              This  environment  variable should be set to the name of the object file to be displayed when tgif
              is iconified.  By default, it is set to ``tgificon''.  If it starts with a /  character,  absolute
              path is used; otherwise, the icon file is assumed to be $TGIFPATH/$TGIFICON.

       <u>TGIF_[Domain]</u>
              <u>Obsoleted</u>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       $TGIFPATH/tgificon.obj contains the default tgif icon.

       $TGIFPATH/keys.obj contains a summary of the non-alphanumeric key bindings.

</pre><h4><b>PROLOG/C</b> <b>TESTDRIVE</b></h4><pre>
       In  the tgif distribution, there are three Prolog files which illustrate a simple Prolog driver.  <u>tgif.pl</u>
       contains predicates for parsing tgif files (both .obj and .sym).   <u>frontend.pl</u>  contains  predicates  for
       talking  to  Prolog engines, such as that of Quintus and SISCtus, through the foreign function interface.
       To use frontend.pl, <u>frontend11.o</u> needs  to  be  built  (which  requires  the  <u>frontend11.o</u>  entry  to  be
       uncommented  from  the  makefiles).  Finally, <u>testdrive.pl</u> contains a program which will print out the ID
       files of all objects in the current drawing, if tgif is escaped with the Solve() (or #s)  command.   This
       is  also  a good way of finding out the structure of a tgif file (especially because the structure is not
       documented due to the complexity  introduced  to  keep  tgif  compatible  with  files  created  by  older
       versions).

       A  very  simple C driver, <u>testdrive.c</u>, is also provided with the tgif distribution which perform the same
       function as the Prolog driver.  The extra code present in this file (and not present in tgif.c)  is  used
       to  illustrate  how  the  in-memory  objects  and  attributes can be traversed and how new objects can be
       created and manipulated.

</pre><h4><b>IDIOSYNCRASIES</b></h4><pre>
       When any of the ``escape to driver'' commands are (accidentally) executed, the  current  content  of  the
       drawing is saved into ``tmpmodel.obj'' if the drawing indicates that it is a .obj file; then tgif escapes
       to  the driver and returns right away.  If the drawing indicates that it is a .sym file, then the content
       is saved into ``tmpmodel.sym'', but tgif does not return to the driver.

       The paste operation works on a cut buffer generated by tgif or by non-tgif tools (such as <u>xterm</u>).  If the
       cut buffer is <u>not</u> generated by tgif, its content is treated as a collection of ASCII  character  strings,
       which  is  inserted into the current drawing as a text object (current settings for text objects are used
       to create the text object).  If the cut buffer <u>is</u> generated by tgif, then all the  current  settings  are
       ignored.

       The  font sizes are the <u>screen</u> font sizes (which correspond to the X fonts that are used to draw the text
       on the screen).  They appear smaller on the printout.   When  a  24  point  text  is  printed,  it  would
       correspond to about a 13.5 point PostScript text.  This is because tgif treats 128 pixels as an inch, and
       PostScript treats 72 points as an inch.

       Because  characters  supported by X11 and PostScript are different, not all the characters, especially in
       the range 128 to 255 (or \200 to \377), which are supported  by  X11,  but  are  not  accepted  by  tgif.
       Furthermore,  in  order  to  print  the supported subset of these characters, character codes must be re-
       encoded.  Therefore, if one would like to hack tgif to support other personalized fonts,  one  should  be
       careful about the re-encoding mechanism.

       The  grids  are  not absolute; they are specified as screen pixels, and they scale with the current zoom.
       For example, if the grid is set at 16 pixels at maximum zoom, and if the user zooms out once, objects can
       be drawn, moved, or stretched at 16 screen pixel increments, but this corresponds to  32  pixels  in  the
       real coordinate system.

       If  the  vertical text spacing is set to negative values, highlighted text will look a little strange due
       to XOR operations.  If the vertical text spacing is set to be greater than 100 or  less  than  -100,  the
       panel window will not be cleared properly; to clear the panel window, the user may have to close the tgif
       window and then open it again.

       As  described  in  the  TGIF  SUBWINDOWS  section,  in constrained move mode, if both endpoints of a not-
       selected polyline lie inside the object being moved, then the whole polyline is  moved.   This  may  look
       strange  sometimes  because,  for  example, if one starts with a line segment pointing to an object, just
       moving the object will cause the line segment to be ``stretched''; however, if one eventually  moves  the
       object so that the other endpoint is also inside the object, any future movement of the object will cause
       the  whole line segment to move (instead of just moving the original endpoint).  The moving of the vertex
       which is the neighbor of a moved endpoint may also look strange at times.   At  this  point,  one  should
       switch to the unconstrained move mode.

       Another  idiosyncrasy with respect to the constrained move is that right after duplicating an object, the
       constrained move is disabled temporarily because it is assumed that at this point the user would want  to
       move  the  new  object  to  a desirable position, and only after this new object is ``settled down'', the
       constrained move will be re-enabled.  Settling down is signified by doing something other than moving the
       new object.

       Locked objects can be deleted.

       Under the Edit Menu, PasteFromFile() reads a file into the drawing.  Pasting from  a  file  is  different
       from  the  normal  pasting  operation where copying is performed in something like xterm because tabs are
       automatically converted to spaces.  Tabs are ignored when pasting from a file.

       When printing a multipage drawing, all pages (even the ones that contains no objects)  will  be  printed.
       Using  the  PrintOnePage()  command  under the Page Menu one can print the selected page (in <u>stacked</u> page
       layout mode, this is the current page; in <u>tiled</u> page layout mode,  the  user  is  prompted  to  select  a
       visible page).

       Tgif can be setup to use its own icon window (the Tgif.NoTgifIcon and the Tgif.UseWMIconPixmap X defaults
       must  both  be  set  to  false).   However, it may confuse certain window managers.  So, if the effect is
       undesirable, one can set the Tgif.UseWMIconPixmap X defaults to true.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There seems to be a problem with printing Courier fonts with a non-solid pen on  the  Apple  LaserWriter.
       (Printing  single  character does seem to work fine.)  As pointed out by the PostScript reference manual,
       Courier is a ``stroked font'', and it is usually ``difficult'' to  construct  character  paths  for  such
       types  of  fonts.  However, Courier fonts work fine with <a href="../man1/ghostscript.1.html">ghostscript</a>(1) and dxpsview.  It's not clear how
       this problem can be fixed.  The author recommends avoiding Courier fonts when printing in color if a non-
       solid pen is desired.

       Arcs with arrow tips don't look very sharp (the tip is not pointed as in open-splines with arrow tips).

       At high magnifications, <u>stretching</u> arcs may cause anomalous behavior due to round off errors.

       When page reduction/magnification is not set at 100%, the markings in the Ruler Windows do not correspond
       to real measurements.

       Copying/pasting large objects might not work because tgif does not use the ``selection'' mechanism (yet).

       If and when tgif crashes, it will try to save the current  content  of  the  drawing  in  a  file  called
       ``EmergencySave.obj''  (or  ``EmergencySave.sym''  if  the  current  drawing  specifies a symbol object).
       Often, the drawing can be restored by loading the ``EmergencySave.obj'' file.  Nevertheless, if the cause
       of the crash is that some objects are corrupted (due to programming bugs), then the ``EmergencySave.obj''
       file may also be corrupted.

       When launching an application, if the command does not end with the '&amp;' character and  the  command  does
       not  terminate,  tgif  also  hangs.   In this case, <a href="../man1/kill.1.html">kill</a>(1) should be used to send HUP signal to the tgif
       process if one wants to save the content of tgif in ``EmergencySave.obj''.

       The file <u>exec.c</u> may not compile properly on AIX machines.  One might have to add -D_BSD to the DEFINES in
       either the Imakefile or Makefile.noimake.
