</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sdcc - Small Device C Compiler

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sdcc</b> <u>[options]</u> <u>filename</u>

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       The information in this man page is an extract from the full documentation of SDCC, and is limited to the
       meaning of the options.

       For complete and current documentation, refer to the <b>SDCC</b> <b>Compiler</b> <b>User</b> <b>Guide</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SDCC</b>  is  free open source, retargettable, optimizing ANSI-C compiler designed for 8 bit Microprocessors.
       The current version targets Intel MCS51 based Microprocessors (8031,  8032,  8051,  8052,  etc.),  Dallas
       DS80C390  variants, Freescale (formerly Motorola) HC08 and Zilog Z80 based MCUs (z80, z180, gbz80, Rabbit
       2000/3000). It can  be  retargeted  for  other  microprocessors,  support  for  Microchip  PIC  is  under
       development.

       <b>SDCC</b> uses a modified version of ASXXXX &amp; ASLINK, free open source retargetable assembler &amp; linker.

       <b>SDCC</b>  has  extensive  language  extensions suitable for utilizing various microcontrollers and underlying
       hardware effectively.

       <b>SDCC</b> uses <b>ASXXXX</b> &amp; <b>ASLINK</b>, a Freeware, retargettable assembler &amp; linker.   <b>SDCC</b>  has  extensive  language
       extensions suitable for utilizing various microcontrollers and underlying hardware effectively.

       The  compiler  also  allows  inline  assembler  code  to be embedded anywhere in a function. In addition,
       routines developed in assembly can also be called.

</pre><h4><b>PREPROCESSOR</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-I</b><u>&lt;path&gt;</u>
              The additional location where the pre processor will look for `&lt;..h&gt;' or `..h' files.

       <b>-D</b> <u>&lt;macro[=value]&gt;</u>
              Command line definition of macros. Passed to the pre processor.

       <b>-M</b>     Tell the preprocessor to output a rule suitable for  make  describing  the  dependencies  of  each
              object  file.  For  each  source  file, the preprocessor outputs one make-rule whose target is the
              object file name for that source file and whose dependencies are all the files `#include'd in  it.
              This  rule  may  be a single line or may be continued with `\'-newline if it is long.  The list of
              rules is printed on standard output instead of the preprocessed C program.  <b>`-M'</b> implies <b>`-E'</b>.

       <b>-C</b>     Tell the preprocessor not to discard comments. Used with the <b>`-E'</b> option.

       <b>-MM</b>    Like <b>`-M'</b> but the output mentions only the user header  files  included  with  `#include  "file"'.
              System header files included with `#include &lt;file&gt;' are omitted.

       <b>-A</b> <u>question(answer)</u>
              Assert  the  answer answer for question, in case it is tested with a preprocessor conditional such
              as `#if #question(answer)'.  <b>`-A-'</b> disables the standard assertions  that  normally  describe  the
              target machine.

       <b>-A</b> <u>question</u>
              (answer)  Assert  the  answer  answer  for  question,  in  case  it  is tested with a preprocessor
              conditional such as `#if #question(answer)'.  <b>`-A-'</b> disables the standard assertions that normally
              describe the target machine.

       <b>-Umacro</b>
              Undefine macro macro.  <b>`-U'</b>  options  are  evaluated  after  all  <b>`-D'</b>  options,  but  before  any
              <b>`-include'</b> and <b>`-imacros'</b> options.

       <b>-dM</b>    Tell the preprocessor to output only a list of the macro definitions that are in effect at the end
              of preprocessing. Used with the <b>'-E'</b> option.

       <b>-dD</b>    Tell  the  preprocessor to pass all macro definitions into the output, in their proper sequence in
              the rest of the output.

       <b>-dN</b>    Like <b>`-dD'</b>except that the macro arguments  and  contents  are  omitted.  Only  `#define  name'  is
              included in the output.

</pre><h4><b>LINKER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-L,</b> <b>-lib-path</b><u>&lt;absolute</u> <u>path</u> <u>to</u> <u>additional</u> <u>libraries&gt;</u>
              This option is passed to the linkage editor's additional libraries search path. The path name must
              be  absolute. Additional library files may be specified in the command line. See section Compiling
              programs for more details.

       <b>--xram-loc</b> <u>&lt;Value&gt;</u>
              The start location of the external  ram,  default  value  is  0.  The  value  entered  can  be  in
              Hexadecimal or Decimal format, e.g.: <b>--xram-loc</b> <b>0x8000</b> or <b>--xram-loc</b> <b>32768</b>.

       <b>--code-loc</b> <u>&lt;Value&gt;</u>
              The  start  location  of  the  code  segment,  default  value 0. Note when this option is used the
              interrupt vector table is also relocated to the  given  address.  The  value  entered  can  be  in
              Hexadecimal or Decimal format, e.g.: <b>--code-loc</b> <b>0x8000</b> or <b>--code-loc</b> <b>32768</b>.

       <b>--stack-loc</b> <u>&lt;Value&gt;</u>
              The  initial  value  of  the stack pointer. The default value of the stack pointer is <b>0x07</b> if only
              register bank 0 is used, if other register banks are used then the stack pointer is initialized to
              the location above the highest register bank used. eg. if register banks 1 &amp; 2 are used the  stack
              pointer  will default to location <b>0x18</b>. The value entered can be in Hexadecimal or Decimal format,
              eg.  <b>--stack-loc</b> <b>0x20</b> or <b>--stack-loc</b> <b>32</b>. If all four register banks are used  the  stack  will  be
              placed after the data segment (equivalent to <b>--stack-after-data</b>)

       <b>--stack-after-data</b>
              This option will cause the stack to be located in the internal ram after the data segment.

       <b>--data-loc</b> <u>&lt;Value&gt;</u>
              The  start location of the internal ram data segment, the default value is <b>0x30</b>. The value entered
              can be in Hexadecimal or Decimal format, eg.  <b>--data-loc</b> <b>0x20</b> or <b>--data-loc</b> <b>32</b>.

       <b>--idata-loc</b> <u>&lt;Value&gt;</u>
              The start location of the indirectly addressable internal ram, default value is  <b>0x80</b>.  The  value
              entered can be in Hexadecimal or Decimal format, eg.  <b>--idata-loc</b> <b>0x88</b> or <b>--idata-loc</b> <b>136</b>.

       <b>--out-fmt-ihx</b>
              The linker output (final object code) is in Intel Hex format. (This is the default option).

       <b>--out-fmt-s19</b>
              The linker output (final object code) is in Motorola S19 format.

</pre><h4><b>MCS51</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--model-large</b>
              Generate  code for Large model programs see section Memory Models for more details. If this option
              is used all source files in the project should be compiled  with  this  option.  In  addition  the
              standard library routines are compiled with small model, they will need to be recompiled.

       <b>--model-small</b>
              Generate  code  for  Small  Model programs see section Memory Models for more details. This is the
              default model.

</pre><h4><b>DS390</b> <b>/</b> <b>DS400</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--model-flat24</b>
              Generate 24-bit flat mode code. This is the one and only that the ds390  code  generator  supports
              right now and is default when using <b>-mds390</b>.

       <b>--protect-sp-update</b>
              Disable interrupts during ESP:SP updates.

       <b>_--stack-10bit</b>
              Generate code for the 10 bit stack mode of the Dallas DS80C390 part. This is the one and only that
              the  ds390  code generator supports right now and is default when using <b>-mds390</b>. In this mode, the
              stack is located in the lower 1K of the internal RAM, which is mapped to <b>0x400000</b> . Note that  the
              support  is  incomplete,  since  it still uses a single byte as the stack pointer. This means that
              only the lower 256 bytes of the potential 1K stack space will actually be used. However, this does
              allow you to reclaim the precious 256 bytes of low RAM for use for the DATA  and  IDATA  segments.
              The  compiler  will  not  generate  any  code  to  put the processor into 10 bit stack mode. It is
              important to ensure that the processor is in this mode before  calling  any  re-entrant  functions
              compiled  with  this option. In principle, this should work with the <b>--stack-auto</b> <b>option</b>, but that
              has not been tested. It is incompatible with the <b>--xstack</b> option. It also only makes sense if  the
              processor is in 24 bit contiguous addressing mode (see the <b>--model-flat24</b> option).

</pre><h4><b>Z80</b> <b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--callee-saves-bc</b>
              Force a called function to always save BC.

       <b>--no-std-crt0</b>
              When  linking,  skip  the  standard  crt0.o object file. You must provide your own crt0.o for your
              system when linking.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIMIZATIONS</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--nogcse</b>
              Will not do global subexpression elimination, this option may be used when  the  compiler  creates
              undesirably  large  stack/data  spaces  to  store  compiler temporaries. A warning message will be
              generated when this happens and the compiler will indicate the number of extra bytes it allocated.
              It recommended that this option NOT be used, <b>#pragma</b>  <b>NOGCSE</b>  can  be  used  to  turn  off  global
              subexpression elimination for a given function only.

       <b>--noinvariant</b>
              Will  not  do  loop  invariant optimizations, this may be turned off for reasons explained for the
              previous option. For more details of loop optimizations performed see section  Loop  Invariants.It
              recommended  that  this  option NOT be used, <b>#pragma</b> <b>NOINVARIANT</b> can be used to turn off invariant
              optimizations for a given function only.

       <b>--noinduction</b>
              Will not do loop induction optimizations, see section strength reduction for more details.  It  is
              recommended  that  this  option is NOT used, <b>#pragma</b> <b>NOINDUCTION</b> can be used to turn off induction
              optimizations for a given function only.

       <b>--nojtbound</b>
              Will not generate boundary condition check when switch  statements  are  implemented  using  jump-
              tables.  It is recommended that this option is NOT used, <b>#pragma</b> <b>NOJTBOUND</b> can be used to turn off
              boundary checking for jump tables for a given function only.

       <b>--noloopreverse</b>
              Will not do loop reversal optimization.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c,</b> <b>--compile-only</b>
              will compile and assemble the source, but will not call the linkage editor.

       <b>-E</b>     Run only the C preprocessor. Preprocess all the C source files specified and output the results to
              standard output.

       <b>--stack-auto</b>
              All functions in the source file will be compiled as reentrant,  i.e.  the  parameters  and  local
              variables  will  be allocated on the stack. If this option is used all source files in the project
              should be compiled with this option.

       <b>--xstack</b>
              Uses a pseudo stack in the first 256 bytes in  the  external  ram  for  allocating  variables  and
              passing parameters.

       <b>--callee-saves</b> <u>function1[,function2][,function3]....</u>
              The  compiler by default uses a caller saves convention for register saving across function calls,
              however this can cause unnecessary register pushing &amp; popping when calling  small  functions  from
              larger  functions.  This  option  can  be  used  to  switch the register saving convention for the
              function names specified.  The compiler will not save registers when calling these  functions,  no
              extra  code  will  be  generated  at  the  entry  &amp; exit for these functions to save &amp; restore the
              registers used by these  functions,  this  can  <u>SUBSTANTIALLY</u>  reduce  code  &amp;  improve  run  time
              performance of the generated code. In the future the compiler (with interprocedural analysis) will
              be able to determine the appropriate scheme to use for each function call.  <u>DO</u> <u>NOT</u> use this option
              for  built-in  functions  such  as  <b>_muluint</b>..., if this option is used for a library function the
              appropriate library function needs to be recompiled with the same option. If the project  consists
              of  multiple source files then all the source file should be compiled with the same <b>--callee-saves</b>
              option string.

       <b>--debug</b>
              When this option is used the compiler will generate debug information, that can be used  with  the
              <b>SDCDB</b>. The debug information is collected in a file with .cdb extension.

       <b>--regextend</b>
              This option is obsolete and isn't supported anymore.

       <b>--noregparms</b>
              This option is obsolete and isn't supported anymore.

       <b>--peep-file</b><u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              This option can be used to use additional rules to be used by the peep hole optimizer.

       <b>-S</b>     Stop  after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble. The output is an assembler code file
              for the input file specified.

       <b>-Wa_</b><u>asmOption[,asmOption]...]</u>
              Pass the asmOption to the assembler.

       <b>-Wl_</b><u>linkOption[,linkOption]...]</u>
              Pass the linkOption to the linker.

       <b>--int-long-reent</b>
              Integer (16 bit) and long (32 bit) libraries have been compiled as  reentrant.   Note  by  default
              these libraries are compiled as non-reentrant.

       <b>--cyclomatic</b>
              This  option  will  cause the compiler to generate an information message for each function in the
              source file. The message contains some important information about the  function.  The  number  of
              edges  and  nodes  the  compiler  detected  in  the  control  flow graph of the function, and most
              importantly the cyclomatic complexity.

       <b>--float-reent</b>
              Floating point library is compiled as reentrant.

       <b>--nooverlay</b>
              The compiler will not overlay  parameters  and  local  variables  of  any  function,  see  section
              Parameters and local variables for more details.

       <b>--main-return</b>
              This option can be used when the code generated is called by a monitor program.  The compiler will
              generate  a  'ret'  upon  return  from  the 'main' function. The default option is to lock up i.e.
              generate a 'ljmp '.

       <b>--no-peep</b>
              Disable peep-hole optimization.

       <b>--peep-asm</b>
              Pass the inline assembler code through the peep hole optimizer. This can cause unexpected  changes
              to  inline  assembler  code,  please go through the peephole optimizer rules defined in the source
              file tree '&lt;target&gt;/peeph.def' before using this option.

       <b>--iram-size</b> <u>&lt;Value&gt;</u>
              Causes the linker to check if the internal ram usage is within limits of the given value.

       <b>--nostdincl</b>
              This will prevent the compiler from passing on the default include path to the preprocessor.

       <b>--nostdlib</b>
              This will prevent the compiler from passing on the default library path to the linker.

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Shows the various actions the compiler is performing.

       <b>-V</b>     Shows the actual commands the compiler is executing.

</pre><h4><b>INTERMEDIATE</b> <b>DUMP</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are provided for the purpose of retargetting  and  debugging  the  compiler.  These
       provided  a  means to dump the intermediate code (iCode) generated by the compiler in human readable form
       at various stages of the compilation process.

       <b>--dumpraw</b>
              This option will cause the compiler to dump the intermediate code into a  file  of  named  &lt;source
              filename&gt;.   <b>dumpraw</b>  just  after  the  intermediate  code has been generated for a function, i.e.
              before any optimizations are done. The basic blocks at this  stage  ordered  in  the  depth  first
              number, so they may not be in sequence of execution.

       <b>--dumpgcse</b>
              Will  create  a dump of iCode's, after global subexpression elimination, into a file named &lt;source
              filename&gt;.dumpgcse.

       <b>--dumpdeadcode</b>
              Will  create  a  dump  of  iCode's,  after  deadcode  elimination,  into  a  file  named   &lt;source
              filename&gt;.dumpdeadcode.

       <b>--dumploop</b>
              Will   create   a   dump  of  iCode's,  after  loop  optimizations,  into  a  file  named  &lt;source
              filename&gt;.dumploop.

       <b>--dumprange</b>
              Will  create  a  dump  of  iCode's,  after  live  range  analysis,  into  a  file  named   &lt;source
              filename&gt;.dumprange.

       <b>--dumlrange</b>
              Will dump the life ranges for all symbols.

       <b>--dumpregassign</b>
              Will   create   a  dump  of  iCode's,  after  register  assignment,  into  a  file  named  &lt;source
              filename&gt;.dumprassgn.

       <b>--dumplrange</b>
              Will create a dump of the live ranges of iTemp's

       <b>--dumpall</b>
              Will cause all the above mentioned dumps to be created.
