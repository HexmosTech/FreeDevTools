</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       leo - commandline interface to <a href="http://dict.leo.org/">http://dict.leo.org/</a>.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        leo [-slmcfuphdv] [&lt;term&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>leo</b> is a commandline interface to the german/english/french dictionary on <a href="http://dict.leo.org/">http://dict.leo.org/</a>. It
       supports almost all features which the website supports, plus more.

       Results will be printed to the terminal. By default the searched key word will be highlighted (which can
       be turned off, see below).

       To get faster results, <b>leo</b> is able to cache queries if you repeatedly use the same query.

       <b>leo</b> acts as a standard webbrowser as your mozilla or what so ever does, it connects to the website,
       exectues the query, parses the HTML result and finally prints it somewhat nicely formatted to the
       terminal.

       As of this writing <b>leo</b> acts as:

        Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-s</u> <u>--spelltolerance</u>
           Allow spelling errors.

           Possible values: <b>standard</b>, <b>on</b> or <b>off</b>.

           Default setting: <b>standard</b>.

       <u>-m</u> <u>--morphology</u>
           Provide morphology information.

           Possible values: <b>standard</b>, <b>none</b> or <b>forcedAll</b>.

           Default setting: <b>standard</b>.

       <u>-c</u> <u>--chartolerance</u>
           Allow umlaut alternatives.

           Possible values: <b>fuzzy</b>, <b>exact</b> or <b>relaxed</b>.

           Default: <b>relaxed</b>.

       <u>-l</u> <u>--language</u>
           Translation direction. Please note that dict.leo.org always translates either to or from german.

           The following languages are supported: english, polish, spanish, portuguese russian and chinese.

           You  can   specify only the country  code, or append <b>de2</b>  in order to force translation to german, or
           preprend <b>de2</b> in order to translate to the other language.

           Valid examples:

           ru     to or from russian de2pl  to polish es2de  spanish to german

           Valid country codes:

           en    english es    spanish fr    french ru    russian pt    portuguese pl    polish ch    chinese

           Default: <b>en</b>.

       <u>-n</u> <u>--noescapechars</u>
           Don't use escapes for highlighting.

           Default: do highlighting.

           Controllable via config file too. See below.

           No highlighting will be used if STDOUT is not connected to a terminal.

       <u>-f</u> <u>--force</u>
           Don't use the query cache.

           Default: use the cache.

           This option has no effect if <b>use_cache</b> is turned off in the config file.

       <u>-u</u> <u>--user</u>
           Specify the http proxy user to use if your proxy requires authentication. Read  the  'PROXY'  section
           for more details.

       <u>-p</u> <u>--passwd</u>
           Specify the cleartext password to use with http proxy authentication.

           This is not recommended and just implemented for completeness.

       <u>-h</u> <u>--help</u>
           Display this help and exit.

       <u>-v</u> <u>--version</u>
           Display version information and exit.

       <u>-d</u> <u>--debug</u>
           Enable  debugging  output  (a lot of it, beware!), which will be printed to STDERR. If you find a bug
           you must supply the debugging output along with your bugreport.

       <b>term</b> is the key word which you want to translate.  If the term  contains  white  spaces  quote  it  using
       double quotes.

       If the <b>term</b> parameter is not specified, <b>leo</b> will read it from STDIN.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIG</b></h4><pre>
       <b>leo</b> reads a config file <b>.leo</b> in your home directory if it exists. The following variables are supported:

       <u>use_latin</u>
           Turns on conversion of UTF8 characters to their latin* encoding.

           Default setting (if not given): <b>yes</b>.

       <u>use_cache</u>
           Controls the use of the cache (see later).

           Possible values: <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>.

           Default setting(if not given): <b>yes</b>.

           If  the  commandline  option <b>-f</b> or <b>--force</b> has been set then the cache will not be used for the query
           and if for this query exists an entry in the cache it will be removed from it.

       <u>use_color</u>
           Controls the use of escape sequences in the terminal output to highlight the key-waord in the result.

           Possible values: <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>.

           Default setting(if not given): <b>yes</b>.

           You can set this option via commandline too: <b>-n</b> or <b>--noescapechars</b>.

           The config option has higher precedence.

       <u>user_agent</u>
           You may modify the user agent as <b>leo</b> identifies itself on the target site. The default is:

           User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.3.1; X11)

</pre><h4><b>CACHING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>leo</b> supports caching of queries for faster results if you repeatedly use the same query. A query consists
       of the given <b>term</b> (the key word or string) plus the translation option settings.

       If you, for example, execute once the following query:

       % leo langnase

       and somewhere later:

       % leo -c exact

       then <b>leo</b> will treat the latter query as a different one  than  the  previous  one,  because  <u>dict.leo.org</u>
       behaves different when different translation options are given.

</pre><h4><b>PROXY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>leo</b>  can  be  used  with  a  HTTP  proxy  service. For this to work, you only have to set the environment
       variable <b>http_proxy</b>. It has the following format:

       PROTO://[USER:PASSWD@]SERVER[:PORT]

       The only supported protocol is <b>http</b>. If your  proxy  works  without  authentication,  you  can  omit  the
       <b>user:passwd</b> part. If no port is specified, <b>80</b> will be used.

       Here is an example (for bash):

       export http_proxy=<a href="http://172.16.120.120">http://172.16.120.120</a>:3128

       and an example with authentication credentials:

       export http_proxy=<a href="http://max">http://max</a>:<a href="mailto:34dwe2@172.16.120.120">34dwe2@172.16.120.120</a>:3128

       As  security  is always important, I have to warn you, that other users on the same machine can read your
       environment using the 'ps -e ..' command, so this is not recommended.

       The most secure way for proxy authentication is just to specify the server+port with  <b>http_proxy</b>  but  no
       credentials, and instead use the <b>-u</b> commandline parameter to specify a user (do not use <b>-p</b> to specify the
       password,  this  will  also be readyble in process listing). In this case, <b>leo</b> will ask you interactively
       for the password. It will try its best to hide it from being displayed when you type  it  (as  most  such
       routines  in  other  tools  do  it  as well), it this fails (e.g. because you do not have the 'stty' tool
       installed), the password will be read from STDIN.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:~/.leo">~/.leo</a>             the config file for leo. Not required.  <a href="file:~/.leo-CACHE.db">~/.leo-CACHE.db</a>*   the cache file.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>leo</b> depends on <a href="http://dict.leo.org/">http://dict.leo.org/</a>. It may break <b>leo</b> if they change something on the site. Therefore  be
       so  kind and inform me if you encounter some weird behavior of <b>leo</b>.  In most cases it is not a bug of <b>leo</b>
       itself, it is a website change on <a href="http://dict.leo.org/">http://dict.leo.org/</a>.

       In such a case repeat the failed query and use the commandline flag <b>-d</b> (which enables debugging) and send
       the full output to me, thanks.

       The search results returned by <b>leo</b> are based on the work of the people at LEO.org. Thanks for  the  great
       work.

       Some  time ago they told me that they are disagreed with <b>leo</b>, or in other words: from their point of view
       <b>leo</b> seems to break copyright law in some or another way.

       I thought a long time about this, but I must deny this. <b>leo</b> acts  as  a  simple  web  client,  just  like
       mozilla, IE or even lynx are doing. They are providing the service to the public so I use my favorite web
       browser  to  make  use  of  it. In fact my favorite browser to view dict.leo.org is <b>leo</b>. There is nothing
       wrong with that. IMHO.

       If you disagree or are asked by the LEO team to stop using <b>leo</b> you may decide this for yourself. I in  my
       case wrote kinda browser, what is not prohibited. At least not today.
