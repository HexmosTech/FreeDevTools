       ac -  print statistics about users' connect time

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ac</b>     [ <b>-d</b> | <b>--daily-totals</b> ] [ <b>-y</b> | <b>--print-year</b> ]
              [ <b>-p</b> | <b>--individual-totals</b> ] [ <u>people</u> ]
              [ <b>-f</b> | <b>--file</b> <u>filename</u> ] [ <b>-a</b> | <b>--all-days</b> ]
              [ <b>--complain</b> ] [ <b>--reboots</b> ] [ <b>--supplants</b> ]
              [ <b>--timewarps</b> ] [ <b>--compatibility</b> ]
              [ <b>--tw-leniency</b> <u>num</u> ] [ <b>--tw-suspicious</b> <u>num</u> ]
              [ <b>-z</b> | <b>--print-zeros</b> ] [ <b>--debug</b> ]
              [ <b>-V</b> | <b>--version</b> ] [ <b>-h</b> | <b>--help</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ac</b>  prints  out a report of connect time (in hours) based on the logins/logouts in the current <u>wtmp</u> file.
       A total is also printed out.

       The accounting file <u>wtmp</u> is maintained by <b><a href="../man8/init.8.html">init</a></b>(8) and <b><a href="../man1/login.1.html">login</a></b>(1).  Neither <b>ac</b> nor <b>login</b> creates the <u>wtmp</u> if
       it doesn't exist, no accounting is done.  To begin accounting, create the file with a length of zero.

       NOTE:  The <u>wtmp</u> file can get really big, really fast.  You might want to trim it every once and a while.

       GNU <b>ac</b> works nearly the same UNIX <b>ac</b>, though it's a little smarter in several ways.  You should therefore
       expect differences in the output of GNU <b>ac</b> and the output of <b>ac</b>'s on other systems.  Use the command <b>info</b>
       <u>accounting</u> to get additional information.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d,</b> <b>--daily-totals</b>
              Print totals for each day rather than just one big total at the end.  The output looks like this:
                      Jul  3  total     1.17
                      Jul  4  total     2.10
                      Jul  5  total     8.23
                      Jul  6  total     2.10
                      Jul  7  total     0.30
       <b>-p,</b> <b>--individual-totals</b>
              Print time totals for each user in addition to the  usual  everything-lumped-into-one  value.   It
              looks like:
                      bob       8.06
                      goff      0.60
                      maley     7.37
                      root      0.12
                      total    16.15
       <u>people</u> Print  out  the  sum  total of the connect time used by all of the users included in <u>people.</u>  Note
              that <u>people</u> is a space separated list of valid user names; wildcards are not allowed.
       <b>-f,</b> <b>--file</b> <u>filename</u>
              Read from the file <u>filename</u> instead of the system's <u>wtmp</u> file.
       <b>--complain</b>
              When the <u>wtmp</u> file has a problem (a time-warp, missing record, or whatever), print out  an  appro‚Äê
              priate error.
       <b>--reboots</b>
              Reboot  records  are NOT written at the time of a reboot, but when the system restarts; therefore,
              it is impossible to know exactly when the reboot occurred.  Users may have been  logged  into  the
              system at the time of the reboot, and many <b>ac's</b> automatically count the time between the login and
              the  reboot  record  against  the user (even though all of that time shouldn't be, perhaps, if the
              system is down for a long time, for instance).  If you want to count this time, include the  flag.
              *For vanilla <b>ac</b> compatibility, include this flag.*
       <b>--supplants</b>
              Sometimes,  a logout record is not written for a specific terminal, so the time that the last user
              accrued cannot be calculated.  If you want to include the time from the user's login to  the  next
              login  on the terminal (though probably incorrect), include this you want to include the time from
              the user's login to the next login on the terminal (though probably incorrect), include this flag.
              *For vanilla <b>ac</b> compatibility, include this flag.*
       <b>--timewarps</b>
              Sometimes, entries in a <u>wtmp</u> file will suddenly jump back into the past  without  a  clock  change
              record  occurring.   It  is impossible to know how long a user was logged in when this occurs.  If
              you want to count the time between the login and the time warp  against  the  user,  include  this
              flag.  *For vanilla <b>ac</b> compatibility, include this flag.*
       <b>--compatibility</b>
              This is shorthand for typing out the three above options.
       <b>-a,</b> <b>--all-days</b>
              If  we're printing daily totals, print a record for every day instead of skipping intervening days
              where there is no login activity.  Without this flag, time accrued during those  intervening  days
              gets listed under the next day where there is login activity.
       <b>--tw-leniency</b> <u>num</u>
              Set  the  time warp leniency to <u>num</u> seconds.  Records in <u>wtmp</u> files might be slightly out of order
              (most notably when two logins occur within a one-second period  -  the  second  one  gets  written
              first).   By  default,  this value is set to 60.  If the program notices this problem, time is not
              assigned to users unless the <b>--timewarps</b> flag is used.
       <b>--tw-suspicious</b> <u>num</u>
              Set the time warp suspicious value to <u>num</u> seconds.  If two records in the <u>wtmp</u>  file  are  farther
              than  this  number of seconds apart, there is a problem with the <u>wtmp</u> file (or your machine hasn't
              been used in a year).  If the program notices this problem, time is not assigned to  users  unless
              the <b>--timewarps</b> flag is used.
       <b>-y,</b> <b>--print-year</b>
              Print year when displaying dates.
       <b>-z,</b> <b>--print-zeros</b>
              If  a total for any category (save the grand total) is zero, print it.  The default is to suppress
              printing.
       <b>--debug</b>
              Print verbose internal information.
       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print the version number of <b>ac</b> to standard output and quit.
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Prints the usage string and default locations of system files to standard output and exits.
