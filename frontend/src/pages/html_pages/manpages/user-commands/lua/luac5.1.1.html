</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       luac - Lua compiler

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>luac</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>filenames</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>luac</b>  is  the  Lua  compiler.  It translates programs written in the Lua programming language into binary
       files that can be later loaded and executed.

       The main advantages of precompiling chunks are: faster loading, protecting source  code  from  accidental
       user changes, and off-line syntax checking.

       Pre-compiling  does  not  imply faster execution because in Lua chunks are always compiled into bytecodes
       before being executed.  <b>luac</b> simply allows those bytecodes to be saved in a file for later execution.

       Pre-compiled chunks are not necessarily smaller than the corresponding source.  The  main  goal  in  pre-
       compiling is faster loading.

       The  binary  files created by <b>luac</b> are portable only among architectures with the same word size and byte
       order.

       <b>luac</b> produces a single output file containing the bytecodes for all source files given.  By default,  the
       output file is named <b>luac.out</b>, but you can change this with the <b>-o</b> option.

       In the command line, you can mix text files containing Lua source and binary files containing precompiled
       chunks.   This  is  useful  to  combine  several precompiled chunks, even from different (but compatible)
       platforms, into a single precompiled chunk.

       You can use <b>'-'</b> to indicate the standard input as a source file and <b>'--'</b> to signal  the  end  of  options
       (that is, all remaining arguments will be treated as files even if they start with <b>'-'</b>).

       The internal format of the binary files produced by <b>luac</b> is likely to change when a new version of Lua is
       released.  So, save the source files of all Lua programs that you precompile.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options must be separate.

       <b>-l</b>     produce a listing of the compiled bytecode for Lua's virtual machine.  Listing bytecodes is useful
              to  learn  about Lua's virtual machine.  If no files are given, then <b>luac</b> loads <b>luac.out</b> and lists
              its contents.

       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>
              output to <u>file</u>, instead of the default <b>luac.out</b>.  (You can use <b>'-'</b> for standard output, but not on
              platforms that open standard output in text mode.)  The output file may be a source  file  because
              all  files  are  loaded  before  the output file is written.  Be careful not to overwrite precious
              files.

       <b>-p</b>     load files but do not generate any output file.  Used mainly for syntax checking and  for  testing
              precompiled  chunks:  corrupted  files  will  probably  generate  errors  when loaded.  Lua always
              performs a thorough integrity test on precompiled chunks.   Bytecode  that  passes  this  test  is
              completely  safe,  in  the  sense  that  it  will not break the interpreter.  However, there is no
              guarantee that such code does anything sensible.  (None can be given, because the halting  problem
              is  unsolvable.)   If  no  files  are  given, then <b>luac</b> loads <b>luac.out</b> and tests its contents.  No
              messages are displayed if the file passes the integrity test.

       <b>-s</b>     strip debug information before writing the output file.  This  saves  some  space  in  very  large
              chunks, but if errors occur when running a stripped chunk, then the error messages may not contain
              the full information they usually do.  For instance, line numbers and names of local variables are
              lost.

       <b>-v</b>     show version information.
