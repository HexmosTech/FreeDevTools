</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       askmara - do simple dns queries

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>askmara</b> queries the user-specified dns server for records, and outputs the reply in a csv2-compatible
       format (csv2 is the format of zone files that <b>maradns</b> uses).

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>askmara</b> [<b>-n</b>] [<b>-v</b>|<b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u>] <u>query</u> [<u>server</u>]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-t</b>  If  this is present, the following argument is the askmara <u>timeout</u>, in seconds. Note that <b>askmara</b> can
           not both have a user-defined timeout and verbose output.

       <b>-v</b>  If this is set, <b>askmara</b> will verbosely output the complete reply that the server sent. Note that this
           verbose output is not csv2-compatible.

       <b>-n</b>  If this is set, <b>askmara</b>, when sending out a query, will not request DNS recursion;  in  other  words,
           askmara  will request that the remote DNS server not contact other DNS servers to answer the query in
           question.

       <u>query</u>
           dns record to be queried. The query has two sections: The type of record we desire, and the  hostname
           we want this record for.

       The type of query can have two forms: A one-letter mnemonic, or a numeric rtype followed by a colon. This
       is immediately concatenated by the full name of the host name we wish to look up.

       For  example,  to  ask  for  the  IP  of  'example.com.', we can use the one-letter mnemonic, in the form
       'Aexample.com.', or we can use the numeric RR followed by a  colon,  giving  the  query  '1:example.com.'
       (since A has the record type of one). Note that the query name needs the trailing dot at the end.

       Askmara supports a handful one-letter mnemonics, as follows:

       <b>A</b> signifies a request for an A (ipv4 address) RR

       <b>N</b> signifies a NS RR

       <b>C</b> signifies that we are asking for a CNAME RR

       <b>S</b> signifies that we want a SOA RR

       <b>P</b> signifies that we want a PTR RR

       <b>@</b> signifies that we mant a MX RR

       <b>T</b> signifies that we want a TXT RR

       <b>Z</b> signifies that we want to ask for all RRs.

       <u>server</u>
           IP address of the dns server to be queried. If no server is given, askmara will query 127.0.0.1.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Asking the server with the ip 127.0.0.1 for the IP address of example.com:

       askmara Aexample.com.

       Asking the server with the ip 198.41.0.4 for the IP address of example.com:

       askmara Aexample.com. 198.41.0.4

       Asking  the  server  with  the  ip  address  127.0.0.1  for  the  IP  address  of  example.com, using the
       rr_number:query format:

       askmara 1:example.com.

       Asking the server with the ip address 127.0.0.1 for a SRV record. In particular, we  ask  for  the  "http
       over  tcp"  service  for example.net.  Since askmara doesn't have a mnemonic for SRV record types, we use
       the numeric code (33 for SRV):

       askmara 33:_http._tcp.example.net.

       Asking the server with the ip address 127.0.0.1 for the AAAA (ipv6 ip) record for example.net:

       askmara 28:example.net.

       Note that the output will be a raw DNS packet in both the SRV and AAAA examples.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       When askmara is asked for an SOA record, the output of <b>askmara</b> closely resembles the  format  of  a  csv2
       file, but can not be parsed as a csv2 file without modification.

       askmara  outputs  multi-chunk  ("character-string")  TXT  records  incorrectly (it only outputs the first
       chunk).
