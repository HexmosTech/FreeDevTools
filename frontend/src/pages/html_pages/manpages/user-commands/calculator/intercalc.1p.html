       intercalc - CLC-INTERCAL desk calculator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>intercalc</b> [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>intercalc</b> is a simple desk calculator, allowing the user to enter INTERCAL statements (to see what they
       do) and expressions (to see what value they produce); it uses an interpreter object from CLC-INTERCAL to
       provide immediate feedback.

       The desk calculator accepts several options, some of which are documented here.

   <b>User</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-X</b> / <b>--graphic</b>
           Enters  X-based  graphical  user  interface.  Requires  Perl-GTK.  This is the default if Perl-GTK is
           installed, the environment variable <u>$DISPLAY</u> is set and the opening of the X display succeeds.

       <b>-c</b> / <b>--curses</b>
           Enters full screen, curses-based interface. This is the default if the X based  interface  cannot  be
           started, the environment variable <u>$TERM</u> is set and the terminal name is known.

       <b>--line</b>
           Enters  the  line-mode  user  interface.  This  is  the  default  if the X based and the curses based
           interfaces do not work.

           In this mode, the program executes each line from standard input according to the  current  mode  and
           language,  and prints results to standard output.  A line starting with a backspark is interpreted as
           a command to the calculator. Use backspark-g to GIVE UP (you'll need to do it twice), or  backspark-h
           to  display  the  ehm,  help  page.  Things  which are available via menu entries on the Curses and X
           interfaces are also available via the backspark. For now, you can refer to  the  source  code  for  a
           list.

           Command-line  editing  and  command  history  is provided by the readline library. Command completion
           works if the underlying compiler supports it (the compilers provided with the distributions do).

       <b>--batch</b>
           Avoids entering interactive mode. This is the default if  the  standard  input  and  output  are  not
           connected to a terminal and the X based interface cannot be started. This mode is very similar to the
           line mode except that command-line editing and command history are not implemented. Backspark escapes
           work just the same.

       <b>-i</b><u>type</u> / <b>--interface</b>=<u>type</u>
           Selects  the  user interface <u>type</u>. Currently, only <u>X</u>, <u>Curses</u>, <u>Line</u> and <u>None</u> are defined, but more can
           be installed as compiler plug-ins. If the interface selected is <u>None</u>, <b>intercalc</b> will  work  in  batch
           mode. In addition, an empty string will reinstate the default behaviour.

   <b>Source</b> <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>compilation</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>--bug</b>=<u>number</u>
           Selects a different probability for the compiler bug. The compiler bug is implemented by initialising
           the  compiler's  state  with  the  required  probability:  when  a  statement is compiled (usually at
           runtime), a "BUG" instruction is emitted with the required probability. The default is 1%.

       <b>--ubug</b>=<u>number</u>
           Selects a probability for the unexplainable compiler bug. This is the compiler bug which occurs  when
           the  probability  of  a  (explainable)  compiler  bug is zero.  Only wimps would use this option. The
           default is 0.01%.

       <b>-I</b><u>path</u> / <b>--include</b>=<u>path</u>
           Adds a directory before the standard search path for compiler objects and source code. If a  file  is
           accessible from the current directory, it is never searched in any include path.

           If  this  option  is  repeated,  the given paths will be searched in the order given, followed by the
           standard paths.

       <b>-l</b><u>language</u> / <b>--language</b>=<u>language</u>
           Selects the language to use when interpreting user input. This should correspond to  the  name  of  a
           compiler,  which  is  an  INTERCAL object which was originally built by <u>iacc</u>. Only the expression and
           statement parsers are used, so it is possible to test  incomplete  compilers  by  loading  them  into
           <u>intercalc</u>  even  if  they  don't  work  with  <u>sick</u>.  The  default  is obtained from the <u>sickrc</u> option
           <u>.INTERCALC.LANGUAGE</u>.

       -<b>-o</b><u>option</u> -<b>--option</b>=<u>option</u>
           Adds a language option. For example, -<b>-o</b><u>3</u> selects base 3 calculation, and -<b>-o</b><u>wimp</u> selects wimp  mode.
           If  no  options  are  provided,  and the default language was taken from the <u>sickrc</u> file, the default
           options are taken from the <u>sickrc</u> file. Note that if an option or a  language  is  specified  on  the
           command line, the <u>sickrc</u> defaults are ignored.

           Unlike previous versions of <u>intercalc</u>, this version checks that the options make sense in the context
           of  the  calculator;  for  example  trying to load a compiler as an option will cause an error, but a
           compiler extension will be OK.

       <b>-m</b><u>mode</u> / <b>--mode</b>=<u>mode</u>
           Select operation mode. Currently, the only valid modes are <u>full</u>, <u>expr</u> and <u>one</u>. See "Operating Modes".
           If this is not specified, the default is taken from the <u>sickrc</u> option <u>..INTERCALC.MODE</u>.

       <b>--interpreter</b>=<u>module</u>
           Uses an alternative CLC-INTERCAL Interpreter; the selected Interpreter must provide methods to access
           its internal state so that the calculator can display results. The default  is  whichever  compatible
           Interpreter is considered the best at the time the program is distributed.

   <b>Misc</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-r</b><u>name</u> / <b>--rcfile</b>=<u>name</u>
           Executes  commands  from  file <u>name</u> before starting to accept input.  This option can be repeated, to
           execute more than one file. If it is not specified, the standard library, the current directory,  and
           the  current  user's  home directory are searched for files with name <u>system.sickrc</u> or <u>.sickrc</u>, which
           are then executed. The order for this search is: specified library (<b>--include</b>), system library,  home
           directory,  current  directory. This is different from the search order used when looking for objects
           or source code. If a directory contains both <u>.sickrc</u> and <u>system.sickrc</u>, the <u>system.sickrc</u> is executed
           first, followed by <u>.sickrc</u>. Also note that if the current directory or the home directory  appear  in
           the search path and contain one of these files, they will be executed twice.

           If  filenames  are explicitly specified, they must be fully qualified: the search path is not used to
           find them.

       <b>--nouserrc</b>
           Prevents loading a user rcfile (.sickrc); also limits loading  of  system.sickrc  to  the  first  one
           found.  This option is normally only used when testing the installation, to prevent interference from
           previous versions of CLC-INTERCAL.

       <b>--nosystemrc</b>
           Prevents loading system rcfiles (usually in <u>/etc/sick</u>) if any exist.  This option  is  normally  only
           used during installation, to prevent interference from previous versions of CLC-INTERCAL.

       <b>-R</b><u>verb</u> / -<b>--rcskip</b>=<u>verb</u>
           Makes the program ignore the <u>verb</u> in a sickrc file.

</pre><h4><b>Operating</b> <b>Modes</b></h4><pre>
       The calculator can operate in the following modes:

       full Fully functional INTERCAL interpreter.
            The calculator can parse and execute any statement or expression.

            Statements  are  compiled  as a one-statement program, and executed; any register value etc. will be
            preserved between statements, so entering a list of statements is equivalent to running a program in
            which all these statements are executed in sequence.

            It is important to note that some statements will not execute in the normal manner. For  example,  a
            COME FROM will be parsed but have no effect, unless it is something like:

                (1) PLEASE COME FROM (1)

            which  causes the calculator to hang. On the other hand, an ABSTAIN FROM or a REINSTATE will work as
            expected, as will CREATE and DESTROY.  A GIVE UP does not cause the  calculator  to  terminate.  One
            final  difference  is  that comments are not parsed, and therefore you get a "Syntax Error" from the
            calculator rather than a splat *000 from the INTERCAL interpreter.

            For expressions, the calculator READs OUT  the  expression's  result.   Any  side  effects  will  be
            remembered, so if the expression contains overloads they will remain to haunt the calculator.

       expr INTERCAL expression interpreter
            The  calculator can only parse expressions or assignments. In either case, the calculated values are
            READ OUT; assignments will also store the value to the  destination,  while  expressions  will  then
            discard the result.

       oic The <b>O</b>ne <b>I</b>nstruction <b>C</b>alculator.
            This  is  something we've made up one early morning while discussing desk calculators (as one does).
            It is not INTERCAL at all, in fact it is inspired from the One Instruction Set Computer.

            The calculator has a number of memories (default 100 - these can be changed by appending a number to
            the operating mode, for  example  <u>oic10</u>  will  use  a  10-memory  calculator).  These  memories  are
            identified  by  the  letter <b>m</b> followed by a number; in the default 100-memory version, the first two
            digits after <b>m</b> are the memory, and any subsequent digit forms part  of  the  next  operand.  At  the
            start, all memories are initialised to 0.

            Since  there  is only one operation, there is no need to specify it, so an "operation" is a sequence
            of three operands and a result. The result must be a memory, while each operand can be a number or a
            memory, with the limitation that consecutive numbers are acceptable only if the parser can determine
            where one ends and the next one starts. So for example "1-0" is two numeric operands, 1 and -0  (aka
            0); "1.2.3" is also two operands, 1.2 and 3; "12" is a single operand, even if you intended it to be
            two  operands, 1 and 2, and even if you put spaces: "1 2" is still interpreted as the single operand
            12.

            The operation performed is the difference between the first two operands, divided by the third.  For
            example, the three operations:

                7 m01 2 M01
                1 m02 1 m02
                m1 .5 m2 m03

            will  produce  results m01=3.5 ((7-0)/2); m02=1 ((1-0)/1); m03=3 ((3.5-.5)/1).  and will produce the
            following output if the calculator is running in batch mode:

                m01                  3.5     (7 - m01) / 2
                m02                    1     (1 - m02) / 1
                m03                    3     (m01 - .5) / m02
