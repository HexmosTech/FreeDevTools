</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gp - The PARI calculator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gp</b>  [<b>-s</b>  <u>stacksize</u>]  [<b>-p</b>  <u>primelimit</u>]  [<b>--emacs</b>] [<b>-f</b>|<b>--fast</b>] [<b>-q</b>|<b>--quiet</b>] [<b>-D</b>|<b>--default</b> <u>key=val</u>] [<b>--help</b>]
       [<b>--test</b>] [<b>--texmacs</b>] [<b>--version</b>] [<b>--version-short</b>] [ file1 file2 ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Invokes the PARI-GP calculator <b>gp</b>; gp is an advanced  programmable  calculator,  specializing  in  number
       theory,  which computes symbolically as long as possible, numerically where needed, and contains a wealth
       of arithmetic functions: factorizations, elliptic curves, Galois  theory,  class  field  theory,  modular
       forms,  etc.   Commands,  written  in  the  GP scripting language, are input interactively or loaded from
       files.

       If present at the end of the command line, files 'file1', 'file2', ...  are loaded on startup; they  must
       be written in the GP language.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Command line options are available in both short form (-f) and POSIX-like (--fast). Numeric arguments can
       be  followed  by a modifier <b>k</b> , <b>M</b> or <b>G</b> at the user's convenience; in that case the argument is multiplied
       by 10^3, 10^6, or 10^9 respectively.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--fast</b>
              Fast start (or factory settings). Do not read <b>.gprc</b> (see below) upon startup.

       <b>-p</b> <b>limit</b>
              [DEPRECATED] Upon  startup,  gp  computes  a  table  of  small  primes  used  in  number-theoretic
              applications.  If  <u>primelimit</u>  is  set,  the  table include primes up to that bound instead of the
              default (= 500000). It is now mostly useless to change this value.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Quiet mode. Do not print headers or history numbers and do not say goodbye.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--default</b> <b>key=val</b>
              performs <b>default(key,</b> <b>val)</b>; on startup, overriding values from the <b>gprc</b>  preferences  file.  'val'
              must  be  a  constant value and is not allowed to involve any computation (e.g. 1+1 is forbidden).
              Any number of such default-setting statements may appear on the command line. A  key  may  be  set
              multiple times, the last setting taking precedence

       <b>-s</b> <b>limit</b>
              Size  of  gp  internal  stack  allocated  on startup. When gp runs out of space, it interrupts the
              current computation and raises a <b>stack</b> <b>overflow</b> exception. If this occurs frequently, start with a
              bigger stack. The stack size can also be increased from within gp, using  <b>default(parisize,</b>limit)<b>;</b>
              it  is  convenient  to  set  <b>parisize</b>  from  your  <b>.gprc</b>  to that the setting is persistent across
              sessions; a value of 80MB is sensible.  We strongly advise to also set <b>parisizemax</b> to a  positive,
              much  larger, value in your <b>.gprc</b> (about what you believe your machine can stand, usually half the
              available RAM or so): this strives to fit computation in the  parisize  range  but  allows  it  to
              temporarily  go beyond it (up to parisizemax).  Note that computations with a <b>smaller</b> stack may be
              more efficient due to better data locality. Finally, <b>threadsize</b> and <b>threadsizemax</b>  play  analogous
              roles in the parallel version of gp.

       <b>--emacs</b>
              gp can be run in an <u>Emacs</u> shell (see GP User's manual for details). This flag is then required for
              smooth  interaction  with  the <u>PariEmacs</u> package (pari.el). It is set automatically by the pari.el
              package, and will produce display oddities if you set it outside of an <u>Emacs</u> session.

       <b>--help</b> print a summary of available command-line options.

       <b>--test</b> run gp in test mode: suppress printing of history numbers and  wrap  long  output  lines  (to  get
              readable diff output). For benches only.

       <b>--texmacs</b>
              gp  can  be  run  from  a <u>TeXmacs</u> frontend. This flag is set by TeXmacs, to enable special purpose
              communication channels. Do not set it yourself.

       <b>--version</b>
              output version info (banner) then exit.

       <b>--version-short</b>
              output version number then exit.

</pre><h4><b>USE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>?</b>      to get online help.

       <b>??</b>     to get extended online help (more precisely, to call the external help program, <b>gphelp</b> by default)

       <b>quit</b>   (or \q), or <b>EOF</b> (Ctrl-D) to quit <b>gp</b>.

       The following works only when gp was linked with GNU <u>readline</u> library:

       arrow keys
              for editing and viewing the input history.

       <b>TAB</b>
               for automatic completion

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>gp</u>     main executable

       <u>$HOME/.gprc</u>
              (or $GPRC if set) user preference file, read at beginning of execution by each <b>gp</b> shell. A default
              gprc  <u>gprc.dft</u>  is  provided  with  the  distribution.  If this file cannot be found, <u>/etc/gprc</u> is
              checked instead.

       <u>&lt;logfile&gt;</u>
              a file used to log in all commands and results; default: <b>pari.log</b> (you need to set the <b>log</b> default
              in your gprc or interactively)

       <u>&lt;psfile&gt;</u>
              a file used to dump PostScript drawings; default: <b>pari.ps</b>

       <u>&lt;histfile&gt;</u>
              a file where gp will keep a history of all input commands (you need to set the <b>histfile</b> default in
              the gprc file)

       <u>gphelp</u> default external help program (as above)

       <u>*.gp</u>   GP programs

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$GPRC</u>  place to look for the user's preference file (gprc); if the file does not exist, we then check  in
              $HOME/.gprc, /etc/gprc, and finally for a file named 'gprc' in PARI's <b>datadir.</b>

       <u>$GP_DATA_DIR</u>
              directory containing data installed by optional PARI packages.  For example, the Galois resolvents
              files  in  directory <u>galdata/</u> needed by the <b>polgalois</b> function, in degrees 8 to 11; or the modular
              polynomials in <u>seadata/</u> used by the  <b>ellap</b>  function  for  large  base  fields.  This  environment
              variable overrides PARI's 'datadir', defined at Configure time.

       <u>$GP_POSTSCRIPT_VIEWER</u>
              an application able to display PostScript files, used by the <u>plotps</u> graphic engine. This engine is
              a  fallback used to output hi-res plots even when no compatible graphical library was available on
              your platform at Configure time. (Dumps the graph to a temporary file, then open the file.)

       <u>$GP_SVG_VIEWER</u>
              an application able to display SVG images files, used by the <u>plotsvg</u> graphic engine.  This  engine
              is  a fallback used to output hi-res plots even when no compatible graphical library was available
              on your platform at Configure time. (Dumps the graph to a temporary file, then open the file.)

       <u>$GPHELP</u>
              name of the external help program invoked by ?? and ??? shortcuts.

       <u>$GPTMPDIR</u>
              name of the directory where temporary files will be generated.

</pre><h4><b>TRIVIA</b></h4><pre>
       Despite  the  leading  G, GP has nothing to do with GNU. The first version was originally called GPC, for
       Great Programmable Calculator. When people started calling it "the GPC Calculator", the  trailing  C  was
       dropped.

       PARI  has  nothing to do with the French capital. The name is a pun about the project's early stages when
       the authors started to implement a library for "Pascal ARIthmetic" in the  PASCAL  programming  language.
       They quickly switched to C.

       For  the  benefit  of  non-native  French speakers, here's a slightly expanded explanation: <b>Blaise</b> <b>Pascal</b>
       (1623-1662) was a famous French mathematician and philosopher who was one of the founders of  probability
       and  devised  one  of  the  first  "arithmetic  machines".  He once proposed the following "proof" of the
       existence of God for the unbelievers: whether He exists or not  I  lose  nothing  by  believing  in  Him,
       whereas if He does and I misbehave... This is the so-called "pari de Pascal" (Pascal's Wager).

       Note that PARI also means "fairy" in Persian.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       PARI  was  originally  written by Christian Batut, Dominique Bernardi, Henri Cohen, and Michel Olivier in
       Laboratoire A2X (Universite Bordeaux I, France), and was maintained by Henri Cohen up to version  1.39.15
       (1995), and by Karim Belabas since then.

       A great number of people have contributed to the successive improvements which eventually resulted in the
       present version. See the AUTHORS file in the distribution.
