       perltrap - Perl traps for the unwary

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The biggest trap of all is forgetting to "use warnings" or use the <b>-w</b> switch; see warnings and "-w" in
       perlrun. The second biggest trap is not making your entire program runnable under "use strict".  The
       third biggest trap is not reading the list of changes in this version of Perl; see perldelta.

   <b>Awk</b> <b>Traps</b>
       Accustomed <b>awk</b> users should take special note of the following:

       •   A  Perl  program  executes only once, not once for each input line.  You can do an implicit loop with
           "-n" or "-p".

       •   The English module, loaded via

               use English;

           allows you to refer to special variables (like $/) with names (like $RS), as though they were in <b>awk</b>;
           see perlvar for details.

       •   Semicolons are required after all simple statements in Perl (except at the end of a block).   Newline
           is not a statement delimiter.

       •   Curly brackets are required on "if"s and "while"s.

       •   Variables begin with "$", "@" or "%" in Perl.

       •   Arrays index from 0.  Likewise string positions in <b>substr()</b> and <b>index()</b>.

       •   You have to decide whether your array has numeric or string indices.

       •   Hash values do not spring into existence upon mere reference.

       •   You have to decide whether you want to use string or numeric comparisons.

       •   Reading  an input line does not split it for you.  You get to split it to an array yourself.  And the
           <b>split()</b> operator has different arguments than <b>awk</b>'s.

       •   The current input line is normally in $_, not $0.  It generally does not have the  newline  stripped.
           ($0 is the name of the program executed.)  See perlvar.

       •   $&lt;<u>digit</u>&gt; does not refer to fields--it refers to substrings matched by the last match pattern.

       •   The  <b>print()</b>  statement does not add field and record separators unless you set $, and "$\".  You can
           set $OFS and $ORS if you're using the English module.

       •   You must open your files before you print to them.

       •   The range operator is "..", not comma.  The comma operator works as in C.

       •   The match operator is "=~", not "~".  ("~" is the one's complement operator, as in C.)

       •   The exponentiation operator is "**", not "^".  "^" is the XOR operator, as  in  C.   (You  know,  one
           could get the feeling that <b>awk</b> is basically incompatible with C.)

       •   The  concatenation  operator is ".", not the null string.  (Using the null string would render "/pat/
           /pat/" unparsable, because the third slash would be interpreted as a division operator--the tokenizer
           is in fact slightly context sensitive for operators like "/", "?", and "&gt;".  And in fact, "."  itself
           can be the beginning of a number.)

       •   The "next", "exit", and "continue" keywords work differently.

       •   The following variables work differently:

                 Awk       Perl
                 ARGC      scalar @ARGV (compare with $#ARGV)
                 ARGV[0]   $0
                 FILENAME  $ARGV
                 FNR       $. - something
                 FS        (whatever you like)
                 NF        $#Fld, or some such
                 NR        $.
                 OFMT      $#
                 OFS       $,
                 ORS       $\
                 RLENGTH   length($&amp;)
                 RS        $/
                 RSTART    length($`)
                 SUBSEP    $;

       •   You cannot set $RS to a pattern, only a string.

       •   When in doubt, run the <b>awk</b> construct through <b>a2p</b> and see what it gives you.

   <b>C/C++</b> <b>Traps</b>
       Cerebral C and C++ programmers should take note of the following:

       •   Curly brackets are required on "if"'s and "while"'s.

       •   You must use "elsif" rather than "else if".

       •   The "break" and "continue" keywords from C become in Perl "last" and "next", respectively.  Unlike in
           C, these do <u>not</u> work within a "do { } while" construct.  See "Loop Control" in perlsyn.

       •   The  switch statement is called "given"/"when" and only available in perl 5.10 or newer.  See "Switch
           Statements" in perlsyn.

       •   Variables begin with "$", "@" or "%" in Perl.

       •   Comments begin with "#", not "/*" or "//".  Perl may interpret C/C++ comments as division  operators,
           unterminated regular expressions or the defined-or operator.

       •   You  can't  take the address of anything, although a similar operator in Perl is the backslash, which
           creates a reference.

       •   "ARGV" must be capitalized.  $ARGV[0] is C's "argv[1]", and "argv[0]" ends up in $0.

       •   System calls such as <b>link()</b>, <b>unlink()</b>, <b>rename()</b>, etc. return nonzero for success, not  0.  (<b>system()</b>,
           however, returns zero for success.)

       •   Signal  handlers  deal  with  signal  names,  not numbers.  Use "kill -l" to find their names on your
           system.

   <b>JavaScript</b> <b>Traps</b>
       Judicious JavaScript programmers should take note of the following:

       •   In Perl, binary "+" is always addition.  "$string1 + $string2" converts both strings to  numbers  and
           then adds them.  To concatenate two strings, use the "." operator.

       •   The "+" unary operator doesn't do anything in Perl.  It exists to avoid syntactic ambiguities.

       •   Unlike  "for...in",  Perl's "for" (also spelled "foreach") does not allow the left-hand side to be an
           arbitrary expression.  It must be a variable:

              for my $variable (keys %hash) {
                   ...
              }

           Furthermore, don't forget the "keys" in there, as "foreach my $kv (%hash) {}" iterates over the  keys
           and values, and is generally not useful ($kv would be a key, then a value, and so on).

       •   To  iterate  over  the  indices  of  an array, use "foreach my $i (0 .. $#array) {}".  "foreach my $v
           (@array) {}" iterates over the values.

       •   Perl requires braces following "if", "while", "foreach", etc.

       •   In Perl, "else if" is spelled "elsif".

       •   "? :" has higher precedence than assignment.  In JavaScript, one can write:

               condition ? do_something() : variable = 3

           and the variable is only assigned if the condition is false.  In Perl, you need parentheses:

               $condition ? do_something() : ($variable = 3);

           Or just use "if".

       •   Perl requires semicolons to separate statements.

       •   Variables declared with "my" only affect code <u>after</u> the declaration.  You cannot write "$x  =  1;  my
           $x;"  and  expect  the first assignment to affect the same variable.  It will instead assign to an $x
           declared previously in an outer scope, or to a global variable.

           Note also that the variable is not visible until the following <u>statement</u>.  This means that in "my  $x
           = 1 + $x" the second $x refers to one declared previously.

       •   "my"  variables are scoped to the current block, not to the current function.  If you write "{my $x;}
           $x;", the second $x does not refer to the one declared inside the block.

       •   An object's members cannot  be  made  accessible  as  variables.   The  closest  Perl  equivalent  to
           "with(object) { method() }" is "for", which can alias $_ to the object:

               for ($object) {
                   $_-&gt;method;
               }

       •   The  object or class on which a method is called is passed as one of the method's arguments, not as a
           separate "this" value.

   <b>Sed</b> <b>Traps</b>
       Seasoned <b>sed</b> programmers should take note of the following:

       •   A Perl program executes only once, not once for each input line.  You can do an  implicit  loop  with
           "-n" or "-p".

       •   Backreferences in substitutions use "$" rather than "\".

       •   The pattern matching metacharacters "(", ")", and "|" do not have backslashes in front.

       •   The range operator is "...", rather than comma.

   <b>Shell</b> <b>Traps</b>
       Sharp shell programmers should take note of the following:

       •   The  backtick operator does variable interpolation without regard to the presence of single quotes in
           the command.

       •   The backtick operator does no translation of the return value, unlike <b>csh</b>.

       •   Shells (especially <b>csh</b>)  do  several  levels  of  substitution  on  each  command  line.   Perl  does
           substitution  in only certain constructs such as double quotes, backticks, angle brackets, and search
           patterns.

       •   Shells interpret scripts a little bit at a time.  Perl compiles the entire program  before  executing
           it (except for "BEGIN" blocks, which execute at compile time).

       •   The arguments are available via @ARGV, not $1, $2, etc.

       •   The environment is not automatically made available as separate scalar variables.

       •   The  shell's  "test"  uses  "=", "!=", "&lt;" etc for string comparisons and "-eq", "-ne", "-lt" etc for
           numeric comparisons. This is the reverse of Perl, which uses "eq", "ne", "lt" for string comparisons,
           and "==", "!=" "&lt;" etc for numeric comparisons.

   <b>Perl</b> <b>Traps</b>
       Practicing Perl Programmers should take note of the following:

       •   Remember that many operations behave differently in a list context than they do in a scalar one.  See
           perldata for details.

       •   Avoid barewords if you can, especially all lowercase ones.  You can't tell  by  just  looking  at  it
           whether a bareword is a function or a string.  By using quotes on strings and parentheses on function
           calls, you won't ever get them confused.

       •   You  cannot discern from mere inspection which builtins are unary operators (like <b>chop()</b> and <b>chdir()</b>)
           and which  are  list  operators  (like  <b>print()</b>  and  <b>unlink()</b>).   (Unless  prototyped,  user-defined
           subroutines can <b>only</b> be list operators, never unary ones.)  See perlop and perlsub.

       •   People  have  a  hard  time remembering that some functions default to $_, or @ARGV, or whatever, but
           that others which you might expect to do not.

       •   The &lt;FH&gt; construct is not the name of the filehandle, it is a readline operation on that handle.  The
           data read is assigned to $_ only if the file read is the sole condition in a while loop:

               while (&lt;FH&gt;)      { }
               while (defined($_ = &lt;FH&gt;)) { }..
               &lt;FH&gt;;  # data discarded!

       •   Remember not to use "=" when you need "=~"; these two constructs are quite different:

               $x =  /foo/;
               $x =~ /foo/;

       •   The "do {}" construct isn't a real loop that you can use loop control on.

       •   Use my() for local variables whenever you can get away with  it  (but  see  perlform  for  where  you
           can't).   Using  local()  actually gives a local value to a global variable, which leaves you open to
           unforeseen side-effects of dynamic scoping.

       •   If you localize an exported variable in a module, its exported value will not change.  The local name
           becomes an alias to a new value but the external name is still an alias for the original.

       As always, if any of these are ever officially declared as bugs, they'll be fixed and removed.
