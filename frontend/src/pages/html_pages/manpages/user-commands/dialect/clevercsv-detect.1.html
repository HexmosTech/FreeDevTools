       Detect the dialect of a CSV file.

       -c, --consistency
           By default, the dialect of CSV files is detected using atwo-step process. First, a strict set of
           checks is used to see if the file adheres to a very basic format (for example, when all cells in the
           file are integers). If none of these checks succeed, the data consistency measure of Van den Burg, et
           al. (2019) is used to detect the dialect. With this option, you can force the detection to always use
           the data consistency measure. This can be useful for testing or research purposes, for instance.

       -e, --encoding
           The file encoding of the given CSV file is automatically detected using chardet. While chardet is
           incredibly accurate, it is not perfect. In the rare cases that it makes a mistake in detecting the
           file encoding, you can override the encoding by providing it through this flag. Moreover, when you
           have a number of CSV files with a known file encoding, you can use this option to speed up the code
           generation process.

       -n, --num-chars
           On large CSV files, dialect detection can sometimes be a bit slow due to the large number of possible
           dialects to consider. To alleviate this, you can limit the number of characters to use for detection.

           One aspect to keep in mind is that CleverCSV may need to read a specific number of characters to be
           able to correctly infer the dialect. For example, in the ``imdb.csv`` file in the GitHub repository,
           the correct dialect can only be found after at least 66 lines of the file are read. Therefore, if
           there is availability to run CleverCSV on the entire file, that is generally recommended.

       -p, --plain
           Print the components of the dialect on separate lines

       -j, --json
           Print the dialect to standard output in the form of a JSON object. This object will always have the
           'delimiter', 'quotechar', 'escapechar', and 'strict' keys. If --add-runtime is specified, it will
           also have a 'runtime' key.

       --no-skip
           The data consistency score used for dialect detection consists of two components: a pattern score and
           a type score. The type score lies between 0 and 1. When computing the data consistency measures for
           different dialects, we skip the computation of the type score if we see that the pattern score is
           lower than the best data consistency score we've seen so far. This option can be used to disable this
           behaviour and compute the type score for all dialects. This is mainly useful for debugging and
           testing purposes.

       --add-runtime
           Add the runtime of the detection to the detection output.
