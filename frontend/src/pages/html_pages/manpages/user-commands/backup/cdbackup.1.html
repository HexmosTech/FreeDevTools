</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cdbackup - Streaming backup to CD-R(W)/DVR-R(W)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       cdbackup [-mvwCDRVX] [-d <u>device</u>] [-r <u>scsi-dev</u>] [-s <u>speed</u>]
                [-i <u>image</u>] [-p <u>num</u>] [-l <u>size</u>] [-a <u>label</u>]
                [-c <u>command</u>] [-E <u>cdrecord</u>] [-- <u>cdrecord-options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       cdbackup is a utility to make streaming backups to CD-R(W)/DVD-R(W) disks. It's designed to work with any
       backup tool which writes the backup to stdout (like tar/cpio/afio).

       <u>NOTE:</u>  this program REQUIRES that a recent version of <b><a href="../man1/cdrecord.1.html">cdrecord</a></b>(1) (or cdrecord-ProDVD for DVD support) is
       present in the PATH.

       While you can perfectly append several sessions on CD-R(W) media, I didn't manage to make  this  work  on
       DVD-R(W)  media.  To  allow  multiple, separate backups on these media, the concept of virtual images has
       been introduced.
       A virtual image is a plain file on your harddisk. You can append several backups to an  image  and  after
       completing your backup session, the image is dumped to CDR/DVD media in one burning session. You can dump
       the same image multiple times too, if you want redundancy on the CDR/DVD media.
       Virtual  image files are never deleted by cdbackup. After dumping an image, you have to delete it by your
       self.

       <u>WARNING!</u> When using this program under Linux, be sure not to use dump on a mounted filesystem. This has a
       high potential for creating corrupted backups. As of kernel version 2.4.19, this has not been  fixed  and
       it    may    not    be    fixed    at    all.    You   can   read   Linus   statement   about   this   at
       &lt;<a href="http://search.alphanet.ch/cgi-bin/search.cgi">http://search.alphanet.ch/cgi-bin/search.cgi</a>?max_results=10&amp;type=long&amp;msgid=<a href="mailto:Pine.LNX.4.21.0104270953280.2067-100000@penguin.transmeta.com">Pine.LNX.4.21.0104270953280.2067-100000@penguin.transmeta.com</a>&amp;domain=ml-linux-kernel&gt;

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b> <u>device</u>
              The device name which is used for reading things like the TOC from a (partly written) media.
              (default: /dev/burner)

       <b>-r</b> <u>scsi-device</u>
              The scsi device which is passed to <b><a href="../man1/cdrecord.1.html">cdrecord</a></b>(1) (via dev=<u>scsi-device</u>).  Must  be  given  as  three,
              comma separated numbers: <u>scsibus</u>,<u>target</u>,<u>lun</u>.
              (default: none or the contents of the environment variable CDR_DEVICE)

       <b>-s</b> <u>speed</u>
              The writing speed which is passed to <b><a href="../man1/cdrecord.1.html">cdrecord</a></b>(1) (via speed=<u>speed</u>).
              (default: 4 or the contents of the environment variable CDR_SPEED)

       <b>-p</b> <u>num</u> The number of sectors (of 2048 byte) to use for padding (see <b><a href="../man1/cdrecord.1.html">cdrecord</a></b>(1) padsize).
              (default: 15)

       <b>-X</b>     Enables  the use of CDROM XA2 mode in <b><a href="../man1/cdrecord.1.html">cdrecord</a></b>(1). By default CDROM mode 1 is used. The default is
              possibly causing problems during restore on certain kernel version/CDROM hardware combinations  at
              the  end  of  the  last  session  on  a  media.  Sony  drives doesn't support CDROM XA 2 mode (see
              <b><a href="../man1/cdrecord.1.html">cdrecord</a></b>(1) -multi).

       <b>-R</b>     Enables DVD writing mode. Make sure that your <b><a href="../man1/cdrecord.1.html">cdrecord</a></b>(1) version is able to burn DVD media.
              Remember that you cannot write multiple sessions to DVD media. Either you stick  with  one  backup
              per media or you have to use virtual images.
              In DVD mode the options -p and -X have no effect.

       <b>-E</b> <u>cdrecord</u>
              Set an alternate cdrecord executeable.
              (default: "cdrecord")

       <b>-i</b> <u>image</u>
              Enables  virtual  image  mode.  The  backup stream is written to the given image file. The file is
              created if it doesn't exist. It's mandatory to give an explicit media size with -l. Take care that
              the created virtual image isn't larger that the media size you want to dump it to later.  You  can
              add up to 96 backups to an virtual image.
              If  the  backup  extends the specified media size and you have enabled multi-disk mode, additional
              image files are created (the filenames are derived from the initial image name by adding a dot and
              a decimal number).
              (default: none)

       <b>-w</b>     Dump the virtual image specified with -i to real media. Image dumps are written as single sessions
              always. If you have enabled multi-disk mode and additional images are found, you're  prompted  for
              media change, so that you can dump all images in turn.
              Virtual images (even when dumped to media) are not compatible with older cdbackup versions.

       <b>-l</b> <u>size</u>
              For  normal  operation the media size is auto-detected from the cdrecord ATIP information. If this
              fails or for virtual image mode use this option to set the media size. This is used  to  calculate
              how much data can be stored on the media.
              By  default the given value is taken as megabytes. You can append a single letter to the number to
              select: (k)ilobytes, (m)egabytes, (g)igabytes or (s)ectors (e.g. 170k, 4488m, 350000s).
              (default: auto-detect)

       <b>-C</b>     Disables creation of the datablock CRC checksum. There is no  real  reason  to  use  this  option,
              unless you can't efford the extra 0,2% media space that is used to store the checksum.
              Although  the  on-disk  layout  of  checksummed  backups  is  different,  they are fully backwards
              compatible with older version of cdbackup, but obviously older versions  can't  check  the  backup
              integrity.

       <b>-a</b> <u>label</u>
              A  text label to identify the backup set. The first 32 characters of this string are save with the
              backup.
              (default: "CDBackup Track")

       <b>-c</b> <u>command</u>
              The command which is executed whenever cdbackup needs to request a new media in  multi-disk  mode.
              This  command  (or  script)  should prompt the user and return after the recording device is ready
              again. The command receives one argument, which is the device name passed with  <b>-d</b>.  This  can  be
              used to issue commands to the device like ejecting the media.
              (default: use internal diskchange prompt)

       <b>-m</b>     Enables  multi-disk  mode.  When the current media is filled, a new media is requested (see option
              <b>-c</b>) and the backup is continued. Backups can only be continued to  empty  media,  this  means  you
              cannot insert a partly filled media for continuation.

       <b>-v</b>     Enables verbose mode.

       <b>-D</b>     Enables DEBUG output (probably not useful for normal use).

       <b>-V</b>     Prints out version information and exits.

       <b>--</b> <u>cdrecord-options</u>
              Pass following options to <b><a href="../man1/cdrecord.1.html">cdrecord</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To create a tar archive of <a href="file:/home">/home</a> and output it to a 700 MB CD-R(W) on /dev/scd0 (scsi device 2,0):

              tar cvf - <a href="file:/home">/home</a> | cdbackup -d /dev/scd0 -r 2,0 -l 700 -a "Test Backup"

       To create a tar archive of <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> and output it to a series (multi-disk mode) of 650 MB CD-R(W) on /dev/sr1
       (scsi device 1,4,0) with writing speed 12 and verbose output:

              tar cf - <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> | cdbackup -d /dev/sr1 -r 1,4,0 -s 12 -m -v

       To create a backup on a virtual image:

              tar cf - <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> | cdbackup -i /tmp/vimage -l 4488m

       Add another backup to the same virtual image (with multi-disk mode):

              tar cf - <a href="file:/home">/home</a> | cdbackup -i /tmp/vimage -l 4488m

       Dump  the  virtual  image  to  one (or several) DVD media on /dev/cdrom (scsi-ide device 0,0,0), enabling
       BURNFREE:

              cdbackup -i /tmp/vimage -w -R -d /dev/cdrom -r 0,0,0 -s 4 -m -- driveropts=burnfree

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>PROBLEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Certain combinations of CDROM drivers and kernel versions are causing a problem when restoring data.  The
       restore process aborts with an read error close to the end of the session, while the data on the media is
       perfectly good.

       All  CDR  sessions written in track-at-once mode (which is unavoidable for multisessions) end in at least
       two unreadable runout sectors (for additional information refer to the file README.copy from the cdrecord
       package). As the kernel does some readahead on the device, it  stumbles  over  these  unreadable  sectors
       before reaching the actual end of data.

       Some drivers are reporting to syslog but doesn't pass the error to the application, while others make the
       application  fail.  From  user  feedback,  it  seems that pure SCSI setups are mostly working fine, while
       ide-scsi setups are likely to fail.

       The author isn't able to provide a full solution, but some hints which may help:

       1.     Update to a recent kernel.

       2.     Disable kernel readahead with option -R when restoring.

       3.     Increase the padsize with option -p. Use values &gt;= 128.

       4.     Use option -X if your writer supports this (Sony drives doesn't supports this mode).

       Please contact the author if you can contribute additional information about the problem.
