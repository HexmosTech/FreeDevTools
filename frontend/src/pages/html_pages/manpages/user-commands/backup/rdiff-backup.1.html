       rdiff-backup - local/remote mirror and incremental backup

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rdiff-backup</b> [options...] <u>action</u> [<u>sub-options</u>...] [<u>locations</u>...]
       <b>rdiff-backup</b> [<b>--new</b>] [<b>-h</b>|<b>--help</b>|<b>-V</b>|<b>--version</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       rdiff-backup is a script, written in <b><a href="../man1/python.1.html">python</a></b>(1) that backs up one directory to another. The target
       directory ends up a copy (mirror) of the source directory, but extra reverse diffs are stored in a
       special sub-directory of that target directory, so you can still recover files lost some time ago. The
       idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental backup. rdiff-backup also preserves
       symlinks, special files, hardlinks, permissions, uid/gid ownership, and modification times.

       rdiff-backup can also operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, like <b><a href="../man1/rsync.1.html">rsync</a></b>(1). Thus you can
       use ssh and rdiff-backup to securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, and only the differences
       will be transmitted. Using the default settings, rdiff-backup requires that the remote system accept ssh
       connections, and that rdiff-backup is installed in the user’s PATH on the remote system. See the REMOTE
       OPERATION section for details.

       Note that you should not write to the mirror directory except with rdiff-backup. Many of the increments
       are stored as reverse diffs, so if you delete or modify a file, you may lose the ability to restore
       previous versions of that file.

       Finally, this man page is intended more as a precise description of the behavior and syntax of
       rdiff-backup. New users may want to check out the <b>examples</b> file included in the rdiff-backup
       distribution.

       The rdiff-backup commands knows four types of parameters

        1. generic options valid for all actions,

        2. one action out of <b>backup</b>, <b>calculate</b>, <b>complete</b>, <b>compare</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>list</b>, <b>regress</b>, <b>remove</b>, <b>restore</b>, <b>server</b>,
           <b>test</b>, <b>verify</b>,

        3. sub-options applicable to each action specifically, even though some are common to multiple actions,

        4. zero, one, two or more location paths, either local or remote.

       Note that this documents the <u>new</u> command line interface of rdiff-backup since 2.1+; for the traditional
       one, check <b><a href="../man1/rdiff-backup-old.1.html">rdiff-backup-old</a>(1)</b> but consider that it is deprecated and will disappear.

   <b>Generic</b> <b>options</b>
       -h, --help
           Prints brief usage information and exits. Add <b>--new</b> to be sure to get this CLI description, and not
           the old one. Placed <u>after</u> the action, outputs the action’s specific help message.

       -V, --version
           Prints the current version number and exits.

       --api-version <u>apiversion</u>
           Sets the API version to the given integer between minimum and maximum versions as given by the <b>info</b>
           action. It is the responsibility of the user to make sure that this version is also supported by any
           server started by this client.

       --chars-to-quote, --override-chars-to-quote <u>chars</u>
           If the filesystem to which we are backing up is not case-sensitive, automatic "quoting" of characters
           occurs. For example, a file 'Developer.doc' will be converted into ';068eveloper.doc'. To quote other
           characters or force quoting, e.g. in case rdiff-backup doesn’t recognize a case-insensitive file
           system, you need to specify this option. <u>chars</u> is a string of characters fit to be used in regexp
           square brackets (e.g. 'A-Z' as in '[A-Z]').

               <b>Caution</b>

               do NOT change the chars to quote within the same repository! Actually, you only need to set this
               parameter when creating a new backup repository. Do also NOT quote any character used by
               rdiff-backup in <b>rdiff-backup-data</b> (any of 'a-z0-9._-')!

       --current-time <u>currenttime</u>
           This option is useful mainly for testing. If set, rdiff-backup will use it for the current time
           instead of consulting the clock. The argument is the number of seconds since the epoch.

       --force
           Authorize a more drastic modification of a directory than usual (for instance, when overwriting of a
           destination path, or when removing multiple sessions with <b>remove</b>). rdiff-backup will generally tell
           you if it needs this.

               <b>Caution</b>

               You can cause data loss if you mis-use this option. Furthermore, do NOT use this option when
               doing a restore, as it will DELETE files, unless you absolutely know what you are doing.

       --fsync, --no-fsync
           This will enable/disable issuing fsync from rdiff-backup altogether. This option is designed to
           optimize performance on busy backup systems.

               <b>Caution</b>

               This may render your backup unusable in case of filesystem failure. Default is hence for fsync to
               be enabled.

       --new, --no-new
           enforce (or not) the usage of the new parameters. The default currently is to show the old usage, but
           this will change in the near future.

       --null-separator
           Use nulls (\0) instead of newlines (\n) as line separators, which may help when dealing with
           filenames containing newlines. This affects the expected format of the files specified by the
           <b>--{include|exclude}-filelist[-stdin]</b> switches as well as the format of the files statistics.

       --parsable-output
           If set, rdiff-backup’s output will be tailored for easy parsing by computers, instead of convenience
           for humans. Currently this only applies when listing increments using the <b>list</b> <b>increments</b> action,
           where the time will be given in seconds since the epoch.

       --remote-schema <u>remoteschema</u>
           Specify an alternate method of connecting to a remote computer. This is necessary to get rdiff-backup
           not to use ssh for remote backups, or if, for instance, rdiff-backup is not in the PATH on the remote
           side. See the REMOTE OPERATION section for details.

       --remote-tempdir <u>dirpath</u>
           use path as temporary directory on the remote side of the connection. If set explicitly, remember
           that "no space left" error messages <u>might</u> apply to this directory.

       --ssh-compression, --no-ssh-compression
           use SSH with or without compression with default remote-schema. This option is ignored when using
           <b>--remote-schema</b>. Compression is on by default.

       --tempdir <u>dirpath</u>
           Sets the directory that rdiff-backup uses for temporary files to the given path. The environment
           variables TMPDIR, TEMP, and TMP can also be used to set the temporary files directory. See the
           documentation of the Python tempfile module for more information. If set explicitly, remember that
           "no space left" error messages <u>might</u> apply to this directory.

       --terminal-verbosity {<b>0</b>,<b>1</b>,<b>2</b>,<b>3</b>,<b>4</b>,<b>5</b>,<b>6</b>,<b>7</b>,<b>8</b>,<b>9</b>}
           select which verbosity to use for messages on the terminal, the default is given by <b>--verbosity</b>.

       --use-compatible-timestamps
           Create timestamps in which the hour/minute/second separator is a - (hyphen) instead of a : (colon).
           It is safe to use this option on one backup, and then not use it on another; rdiff-backup supports
           the intermingling of different timestamp formats. This option is enabled by default on platforms
           which require that the colon be escaped.

       -v, --verbosity {<b>0</b>,<b>1</b>,<b>2</b>,<b>3</b>,<b>4</b>,<b>5</b>,<b>6</b>,<b>7</b>,<b>8</b>,<b>9</b>}
           Specify verbosity level (0 is totally silent, 3 is the default, and 9 is noisiest). This determines
           how much is written to the log file, and without using <b>--terminal-verbosity</b> to the terminal..

   <b>Actions</b>
       backup [CREATION OPTIONS] [COMPRESSION OPTIONS] [SELECTION OPTIONS] [FILESYSTEM OPTIONS] [USER GROUP
       OPTIONS] [STATISTICS OPTIONS] <u>sourcedir</u> <u>targetdir</u>
           back-up a source directory to a target backup repository.

       calculate [--method <b>average</b>] <u>statfile1</u> <u>statfile2</u> [...]
           calculate average across multiple statistics files

           --method <b>average</b>
               there is currently only one method and it is the default, but it might change in the future.

       complete [--cword <u>index</u>] [--unique|--no-unique] <b>--</b> <u>words</u> [...]
           outputs a list of fitting options given already entered parameters. This option is of no relevance to
           backup tasks, it is only to be used to support programmatic completion like in bash. See the
           documentation for more details if you plan to write your own completion code, e.g. for an alternative
           shell.

           --cword <u>index</u>
               index where the cursor currently is within the list of words.

           --unique,--no-unique
               should parameters already entered by the user be offered again, or not?

       compare [SELECTION OPTIONS] [--method <u>method</u>] [--at <u>time</u>] <u>sourcedir</u> <u>targetdir</u>
           Compare a directory with the backup set at the given time. This can be useful to see how archived
           data differs from current data, or to check that a backup is current.

           --method <u>method</u>
               method used to compare can be either <b>meta</b>, <b>full</b> or <b>hash</b>, where the default is <b>meta</b>, which is also
               how rdiff-backup decides which file needs to be backed-up. Note that with <b>full</b>, the repository
               data will be copied in its entirety to the source side and compared byte by byte. This is the
               slowest but most complete compare method. With <b>hash</b> only the SHA1 checksum of regular files will
               be compared. With <b>meta</b> only the metadata of files will be compared (name, size, date, type, etc).

           --at <u>time</u>
               at which <u>time</u> of the back-up directory should the comparaison take place. The default is <b>now</b>,
               meaning the latest version. See TIME FORMATS for details.

       info
           outputs information about the current system in YAML format, so that it can be used in a bug report,
           and exits.

       list <b>files</b> [<b>--changed-since</b> <u>time</u>|<b>--at</b> <u>time</u>] <u>repository</u>
           list modified or existing files in a given back-up repository.

           --changed-since <u>time</u>
               List the files that have changed in the destination directory since the given time. See TIME
               FORMATS for the format of time. If a directory in the archive is specified, list only the files
               under that directory. This option does not read the source directory; it is used to compare the
               contents of two different rdiff-backup sessions. See TIME FORMATS for details.

           --at <u>time</u>
               List the files in the archive that were present at the given time. If a directory in the archive
               is specified, list only the files under that directory. See TIME FORMATS for details.

       list <b>increments</b> [<b>--no-size</b>|<b>--size</b>] <u>repository</u>
           list increments with date in a given back-up repository.

           --no-size,--size
               Show or not the size of each increment in the repository. The default is to <u>not</u> show sizes. When
               showing sizes, it becomes allowable to specify a directory within a repository, then only the
               cumulated sizes of that directory will be shown.

       regress [COMPRESSION OPTIONS] [USER GROUP OPTIONS] [TIMESTAMP OPTIONS] <u>repository</u>
           If an rdiff-backup session fails, this action will undo the failed directory. This happens
           automatically if you attempt to back-up to a directory and the last backup failed. You can use the
           <b>--force</b> option to undo the last backup even if it wasn’t failed (starting with API 201, use
           <b>--api-version</b> if necessary).

       remove <b>increments</b> <b>--older-than</b> <u>time</u> [<b>--size</b>] <u>repository</u>
           Remove the incremental backup information in the destination directory that has been around longer
           than the given time, or the oldest one if no time is provided.

           By default, rdiff-backup will only delete information from one session at a time. To remove two or
           more sessions at the same time, supply the <b>--force</b> option (rdiff-backup will tell you if it is
           required).

           Note that snapshots of deleted files are covered by this operation. Thus if you deleted a file two
           weeks ago, backed up immediately afterwards, and then ran rdiff-backup with 'remove increments
           --older-than 10D' today, no trace of that file would remain.

           --older-than <u>time</u>
               all the increments older than the given time will be deleted. See TIME FORMATS for details.

           --size
               Show the size of each increment being removed. The default is to <u>not</u> show sizes.

       restore [CREATION OPTIONS] [COMPRESSION OPTIONS] [SELECTION OPTIONS] [FILESYSTEM OPTIONS] [USER GROUP
       OPTIONS] [<b>--at</b> <u>time</u>|<b>--increment</b>] <u>source</u> <u>targetdir</u>
           restore a source backup repository at a specific time or a specific     source increment to a target
           directory. See RESTORING for details.

           --at <u>time</u>
               the <u>source</u> parameter is interpreted as a back-up directory, and the content is restored from the
               given time. See TIME FORMATS for details.

           --increment
               the <u>source</u> parameter is expected to be an increment within a back-up repository, to be restored
               into the given target directory.

       server [RESTRICT OPTIONS] [<b>--debug</b>]
           Enter server mode (not to be invoked directly, but instead used by another rdiff-backup process on a
           remote computer).

           --debug
               Start the server in debug mode so that it stops on an early breakpoint and can be remotely
               debugged using rpdb &lt;https://github.com/tamentis/rpdb&gt;. See the developer’s documentation
               &lt;https://github.com/rdiff-backup/rdiff-backup/blob/master/docs/DEVELOP.adoc#debug-client-server-mode&gt;
               for details.

       test <u>remote_location_1</u> [<u>remote_location_2</u> ...]
           Test for the presence of a compatible rdiff-backup server as specified in the remote location
           argument(s) (of which the filename section will be checked for existence). See the REMOTE OPERATION
           section for details.

       verify [<b>--at</b> <u>time</u>] <u>location</u>
           Check all the data in the repository at the given time by computing the SHA1 hash of all the regular
           files and comparing them with the hashes stored in the metadata file.

           --at <u>time</u>
               the time of the data which needs to be verified. See TIME FORMATS for details.

</pre><h4><b>COMPRESSION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --compression, --no-compression
           Enable or disable the default gzip compression of most of the .snapshot and .diff increment files
           stored in the <b>rdiff-backup-data</b> directory. A backup volume can contain compressed and uncompressed
           increments, so using this option inconsistently is fine. Default is to compress all files, except
           those excluded as noted below.

       --not-compressed-regexp <u>regexp</u>
           Do not compress increments based on files whose filenames match regexp. The default includes many
           common audiovisual and archive files, and may be found from the help.

</pre><h4><b>CREATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --create-full-path
           Normally only the final directory of the destination path will be created if it does not exist. With
           this option, all missing directories on the destination path will be created. Use this option with
           care: if there is a typo in the remote path, the remote filesystem could fill up very quickly (by
           creating a duplicate backup tree). For this reason this option is primarily aimed at scripts which
           automate backups.

</pre><h4><b>FILESYSTEM</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --acls, --no-acls
           enable/disable back-up of Access Control Lists.

       --carbonfile, --no-carbonfile
           enable/disable back-up of carbon files (MacOS X).

       --eas, --no-eas
           enable/disable back-up of Extended Attributes.

       --resource-forks, --no-resource-forks
           enable/disable back-up of resource forks (MacOS X).

       --hard-links, --no-hard-links
           do (or not) keep hard-link relationships between files. Disabling hard-links generally increases the
           disk space usage but decreases memory usage. Hard-links are disabled by default if the backup source
           or restore destination is running on native Windows.

       --compare-inode, --no-compare-inode
           This option prevents rdiff-backup from flagging a hardlinked file as changed when its device number
           and/or inode changes. This option is useful in situations where the source filesystem lacks
           persistent device and/or inode numbering. For example, network filesystems may have mount-to-mount
           differences in their device number (but possibly stable inode numbers); USB/1394 devices may come up
           at different device numbers each remount (but would generally have same inode number); and there are
           filesystems which don’t even have the same inode numbers from use to use. Without the option
           rdiff-backup may generate unnecessary numbers of tiny diff files.

       --never-drop-acls
           Exit with error instead of dropping ACLs or ACL entries. Normally this may happen (with a warning)
           because the destination does not support them or because the relevant user/group names do not exist
           on the destination side.

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --restrict-path <u>dirpath</u>
           Require that all file access be inside the given path. This switch, and <b>--restrict-mode</b>, are intended
           to be used with the <b>server</b> action to provide a bit more protection when doing automated remote
           backups.

               <b>Caution</b>

               Those options are <u>not</u> intended as your only line of defense so please don’t do something silly
               like allow public access to an rdiff-backup server run with <b>--restrict-mode</b> <b>read-only</b>.

       --restrict-mode {<b>read-write</b>,<b>read-only</b>,<b>update-only</b>}
           restriction mode for the directory given by <b>--restrict-path</b>, either full access (aka read-write),
           read-only, or only to update incrementally an already existing back-up (default is <b>read-write</b>).

</pre><h4><b>SELECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This section only quickly lists the existing options, the section FILE SELECTION explains those more in
       details.

   <b>Globs,</b> <b>Regex,</b> <b>File</b> <b>lists</b> <b>selection</b>
       --include,--exclude <u>glob</u>
           Include/exclude the file or files matched by <u>glob</u> (also known as shell pattern). If a directory is
           excluded, then files under that directory will also be excluded.

       --include-globbing-filelist,--exclude-globbing-filelist <u>globsfile</u>
           Include/exclude according to the listed globs, similar to <b>--include</b> or <b>--exclude</b>.

       --include-globbing-filelist-stdin,--exclude-globbing-filelist-stdin
           Like the previous option but the list of globs is coming from standard input.

       --include-regexp,--exclude-regexp <u>regexp</u>
           Include/exclude files matching the given regexp (according to Python rules).

       --include-filelist,--exclude-filelist <u>listfile</u>
           Include/exclude the files listed in <u>filelist</u>. This is a best fit for an automatically generated list
           of files, else use globbing.

       --include-filelist-stdin,--exclude-filelist-stdin
           Like the previous but the filelist is coming from standard input.

   <b>Special</b> <b>files</b> <b>selection</b>
           <b>Note</b>

           All special files are included by default, so that including them explicitly isn’t generally
           required. Exceptions are described.

       --include-device-files,--exclude-device-files
           Include/exclude all device files. This can be useful for security/permissions reasons or if
           rdiff-backup is not handling device files correctly.

       --include-fifos,--exclude-fifos
           Include/exclude all fifo files.

       --include-sockets,--exclude-sockets
           Include/exclude all socket files.

       --include-symbolic-links,--exclude-symbolic-links
           Include/exclude all symbolic links. Contrary to the general rule, symlinks are excluded by default
           under Windows so that NTFS reparse points aren’t backed-up.

       --include-special-files,--exclude-special-files
           Include/exclude all the special files listed above.

   <b>Other</b> <b>selections</b>
       --include-other-filesystems,--exclude-other-filesystems
           Include/exclude files on file systems (identified by device number) other than the file system the
           root of the source directory is on. The default is to include other filesystems.

       --include-if-present,--exclude-if-present <u>filename</u>
           Include/exclude directories if they contain the given <u>filename</u>. Files directly in an included
           directory are also considered included. This doesn’t apply recursively though so that the <u>filename</u>
           must be present in <u>all</u> directories of a hierarchy for it to be fully included.

       --max-file-size <u>sizeinbytes</u>
           Exclude files that are larger than the given size in bytes.

       --min-file-size <u>sizeinbytes</u>
           Exclude files that are smaller than the given size in bytes.

</pre><h4><b>STATISTICS</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --file-statistics, --no-file-statistics
           Enable/disable writing to the 'file_statistics' file in the <b>rdiff-backup-data</b> directory. rdiff-backup
           will run slightly quicker and take up a bit less space. Default is to write the statistics file(s).

           See the FILES section for more information about statistics files.

       --no-print-statistics, --print-statistics
           Summary statistics will be printed (or not) after a successful backup. Even if disabled (the
           default), this information will still be available from the session statistics file.

</pre><h4><b>TIMESTAMP</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --allow-duplicate-timestamps
           This option is only to be used if you encounter the issue of metadata mirrors with the same
           timestamp. In such cases, you may use this flag to first recover from the failed backup with
           something like

               rdiff-backup regress --allow-duplicate-timestamps {targetdir}

           after which you will need to remove those old duplicate entries using the <b>remove</b> <b>increments</b> action.

</pre><h4><b>USER</b> <b>GROUP</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       See the USERS AND GROUPS section for more information.

       --group-mapping-file <u>mapfile</u>
           Map group names and IDs according to the group mapping file <u>mapfile</u>.

       --user-mapping-file <u>mapfile</u>
           Map user names and IDs according to the user mapping file <u>mapfile</u>.

       --preserve-numerical-ids
           If set, rdiff-backup will preserve uids/gids instead of trying to preserve unames and gnames.

</pre><h4><b>RESTORING</b></h4><pre>
       There are two ways to tell rdiff-backup to restore a file or directory:

        1. you can run rdiff-backup <b>restore</b> on a mirror file and define a time from which to restore (by default
           the latest one).

        2. you can run the <b>restore</b> action on an increment file with the sub-option <b>--increment</b>.

       For example, suppose in the past you have run:

           rdiff-backup backup <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> /usr.backup

       to back up the '<a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>' directory into the '/usr.backup' directory, and now want a copy of the '<a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>'
       directory the way it was 3 days ago placed at '/usr/local.old'.

       One way to do this is to run:

           rdiff-backup restore --at 3D /usr.backup/local /usr/local.old

       here above the '3D' means 3 days (for other ways to specify the time, see the TIME FORMATS section). The
       '/usr.backup/local' directory was selected, because that is the directory containing the current version
       of 'usr/local'.

       Note that the parameter of <b>--at</b> always specifies an exact time. (So '3D' refers to the moment 72 hours
       before the present). If there was no backup made at that time, rdiff-backup restores the state recorded
       for the previous backup. For instance, in the above case, if '3D' is used, and there are only backups
       from 2 days and 4 days ago, '<a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>' as it was 4 days ago will be restored.

       The second way to restore files involves finding the corresponding increment file. It would be in the
       '/backup/rdiff-backup-data/increments/usr' directory, and its name would be something like
       'local.2002-11-09T12:43:53-04:00.dir' where the time indicates it is from 3 days ago. Note that the
       increment files all end in '.diff', '.snapshot', '.dir', or '.missing', where '.missing' just means that
       the file didn’t exist at that time (finally, some of these may be gzip-compressed, and have an extra
       '.gz' to indicate this). Then running:

           rdiff-backup restore --increment \
               /backup/rdiff-backup-data/increments/usr/local.{time}.dir \
               /usr/local.old

       would also restore the file as desired.

       If you are not sure exactly which version of a file you need, it is probably easiest to either restore
       from the increments files as described immediately above, or to see which increments are available with
       'list increments', and then specify an exact time with <b>--at</b>.

</pre><h4><b>TIME</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       rdiff-backup uses time strings in two places.

       Firstly, all of the increment files rdiff-backup creates will have the time in their filenames in the w3
       datetime format as described in a w3 note at https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime. Basically they look
       like '2001-07-15T04:09:38-07:00', which is basically
       "{Year}-{Month}-{Day}T{Hours}:{Minutes}:{Seconds}{Timezone}", the time zone being 7 hours <u>behind</u> UTC in
       this example (hence the minus).

       Secondly, the <b>--at</b>, <b>--changed-since</b>, <b>--older-than</b> options take a time string, which can be given in any
       of several formats:

        1. the string 'now' (refers to the current time)

        2. a sequences of digits, like '123456890' (indicating the time in seconds after the epoch)

        3. A string like '2002-01-25T07:00:00+02:00' in datetime format

        4. An interval, which is a number followed by one of the characters s, m, h, D, W, M, or Y (indicating
           seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years respectively), or a series of such pairs. In
           this case the string refers to the time that preceded the current time by the length of the interval.
           For instance, '1h78m"' indicates the time that was one hour and 78 minutes ago. The calendar here is
           unsophisticated: a month is always 30 days, a year is always 365 days, and a day is always 86400
           seconds.

        5. A date format of the form "YYYY/MM/DD", "YYYY-MM-DD", "MM/DD/YYYY", or "MM-DD-YYYY", which indicates
           midnight on the day in question, relative to the current timezone settings. For instance, '2002/3/5',
           '03-05-2002', and '2002-3-05' all mean March 5th, 2002 (needless to say that starting with the year
           is less confusing for non-Americans).

        6. A backup session specification which is a non-negative integer followed by 'B'. For instance, '0B'
           specifies the time of the current mirror, and '3B' specifies the time of the 3rd newest increment.

</pre><h4><b>REMOTE</b> <b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       In order to access remote files, rdiff-backup opens up a pipe to a copy of rdiff-backup running on the
       remote machine. Thus rdiff-backup must be installed on both ends. To open this pipe, rdiff-backup first
       splits the location into 'host_info::pathname'. It then substitutes 'host_info' into the remote schema,
       and runs the resulting command, reading its input and output.

       The 'host_info' can be anything understood as a destination by your version of SSH. Assuming it is the
       standard OpenSSH, it can be:

       •   either '[user@]hostname'

       •   or a URI of the form 'ssh://[user@]hostname[:port]'.

       The default remote schema is 'ssh -C {h} rdiff-backup --server' where 'host_info' is substituted for
       '{h}'. So if the 'host_info' is '<a href="mailto:user@host.net">user@host.net</a>', then rdiff-backup runs 'ssh <a href="mailto:user@host.net">user@host.net</a> rdiff-backup
       --server'. Using <b>--remote-schema</b>, rdiff-backup can invoke an arbitrary command in order to open up a
       remote pipe. For instance,

           rdiff-backup --remote-schema 'cd <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>; {h}' backup \
                               foo 'rdiff-backup server'::bar

       is basically equivalent to (but slower than)

           rdiff-backup backup foo /usr/bar

       Concerning quoting, if for some reason you need to put two consecutive colons in the 'host_info' section
       of a 'host_info::pathname' argument, or in the pathname of a local file, you can quote one of them by
       prepending a backslash. So in 'a\::b::c', 'host_info' is 'a::b' and the pathname is 'c'. Similarly, if
       you want to refer to a local file whose filename contains two consecutive colons, like 'strange::file',
       you’ll have to quote one of the colons as in 'strange\::file'. Because the backslash is a quote character
       in these circumstances, it too must be quoted to get a literal backslash, so 'foo\::\\bar' evaluates to
       'foo::\bar'. To make things more complicated, because the backslash is also a common shell quoting
       character, you may need to type in '\\\\' at the shell prompt to get a literal backslash.

       You may also use the placehoders '{Vx}', '{Vy}' and '{Vz}' for the 'x.y.z' version of rdiff-backup, so
       that you can have multiple versions of rdiff-backup installed on the server, and automatically targeted
       from the client.

       For example, if you have rdiff-backup 2.1.5 and 2.2.1 installed in virtual environments on the server,
       respectively under '/usr/local/lib/rdiff-backup-2.0' and '/usr/local/lib/rdiff-backup-2.1' (we assume
       that the z-Version isn’t relevant to any kind of compatibility), then the client may be called with the
       following remote schema:

           ssh -C {h} /usr/local/lib/rdiff-backup-{Vx}.{Vy} --server

       The client will then use the correct version of rdiff-backup based on its own version 'x.y.z'. You’ll
       find more explanations in the <b>migration</b> file in the documentation.

       If you need to include a literal '%' in the string specified by <b>--remote-schema</b>, quote it with another
       '%', as in '%%' (this is due to the compatibility with the deprecated host placeholder '%s', which you
       shouldn’t use anymore).

       And finally, if you need to include literal '{ }' (curly braces) in the the string specified by
       <b>--remote-schema</b>, quote them (both) by doubling each of them up, as in '{{ foo=0; }}'.

       Although ssh itself may be secure, using rdiff-backup in the default way presents some security risks.
       For instance if the server is run as root, then an attacker who compromised the client could then use
       rdiff-backup to overwrite arbitrary server files by "backing up" over them. Such a setup can be made more
       secure by using the sshd configuration option 'command="rdiff-backup server"' possibly along with the
       <b>--restrict-path</b> and <b>--restrict-mode</b> options to rdiff-backup. For more information, see the web page, the
       wiki, and the entries for those options on this man page.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>SELECTION</b></h4><pre>
       rdiff-backup has a number of file selection options. When rdiff-backup is run, it searches through the
       given source directory and backs up all the files matching the specified options. This selection system
       may appear complicated, but it is supposed to be flexible and easy-to-use. If you just want to learn the
       basics, first look at the selection examples in the <b>examples</b> file included in the package, or on the web
       at https://rdiff-backup.net/examples.html.

       rdiff-backup’s selection system was originally inspired by <b><a href="../man1/rsync.1.html">rsync</a></b>(1), but there are many differences. For
       instance, trailing backslashes have no special significance.

           <b>Important</b>

           include and exclude patterns under Windows solely support slashes '/' as file separators, given that
           backslashes '\' have a special meaning in regex/glob patterns.

       All the available file selection conditions are listed under SELECTION OPTIONS.

       Two principles need to be understood before really starting:

        1. pattern matching is stupid about paths, it just does pattern matching and can’t interpret patterns
           like path, especially it can’t resolve absolute into relative paths and vice-versa (compare with the
           '-path' option of find).

        2. pattern matching is done on the complete path of each found file (no partial matching and no file
           name matching). Beware that complete path does <u>not</u> mean full path, it can be a complete relative
           path.

       For example, the pattern 'bar' matches the path 'bar', but doesn’t match the path 'foo/bar' and neither
       the path './bar'. Both are matched by the pattern '*/bar', as well as by '**/bar'. This last pattern
       would match any path containing the file 'bar', e.g. 'foo/boz/bar'.

       Each file selection condition either matches or doesn’t match a given file. A given file is excluded by
       the file selection system exactly when the first matching file selection condition specifies that the
       file be excluded; otherwise the file is included. When backing up, if a file is excluded, rdiff-backup
       acts as if that file does not exist in the source directory. When restoring, an excluded file is
       considered not to exist in either the source or target directories.

       For instance,

           rdiff-backup backup --include <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> \
                               --exclude <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> /backup

       is exactly the same as

           rdiff-backup backup <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> /backup

       because the include and exclude directives match exactly the same files, and the <b>--include</b> comes first,
       giving it precedence. Similarly,

           rdiff-backup backup --include <a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a> \
                               --exclude <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a> <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> /backup

       would backup the '<a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>' directory (and its contents), but not '/usr/local/doc'.

       The include, exclude, include-globbing-filelist, and exclude-globbing-filelist options accept extended
       shell globbing patterns. These patterns can contain the special patterns '*', '**', '?', and '[...]'. As
       in a normal shell, '*' can be expanded to any string of characters not containing '/', '?' expands to any
       character except '/', and '[...]' expands to a single character of those characters specified (ranges are
       acceptable). The new special pattern, '**', expands to any string of characters whether or not it
       contains '/'. Furthermore, if the pattern starts with 'ignorecase:' (case insensitive), then this prefix
       will be removed and any character in the string can be replaced with an upper or lowercase version of
       itself.

       If you need to match filenames which contain the above globbing characters, they may be escaped using a
       backslash '\'. The backslash will only escape the character following it so for '**' you will need to use
       '\*\*' to avoid escaping it to the '*' globbing character.

       Remember that you may need to quote these characters when typing them into a shell, so the shell does not
       interpret the globbing patterns before rdiff-backup sees them.

       The <b>--exclude</b> <u>pattern</u> option matches a file if and only if:

        1. pattern can be expanded into the file’s filename, or

        2. the file is inside a directory matched by the option.

       Conversely, <b>--include</b> <u>pattern</u> matches a file if and only if:

        1. pattern can be expanded into the file’s filename,

        2. the file is inside a directory matched by the option, or

        3. the file is a directory which contains a file matched by  the option.

       For example,

           --exclude <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>

       matches '<a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>', '<a href="file:/usr/local/lib">/usr/local/lib</a>', and '/usr/local/lib/netscape'. It is the same as

           --exclude <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a> --exclude '<a href="file:/usr/local/">/usr/local/</a>**'

       And similarly:

           --include <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>

       specifies that '<a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>', '<a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>', '<a href="file:/usr/local/lib">/usr/local/lib</a>', and '/usr/local/lib/netscape' (but not '/usr/doc')
       all be backed up. Thus you don’t have to worry about including parent directories to make sure that
       included subdirectories have somewhere to go. Finally,

           --include ignorecase:'<a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>[a-z0-9]foo/*/**.py'

       would match a file like '/usr/5fOO/hello/there/world.py'. If it did match anything, it would also match
       '<a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>'. If there is no existing file that the given pattern can be expanded into, the option will not
       match '<a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>'.

       The <b>--include-filelist</b>, <b>--exclude-filelist</b>, <b>--include-filelist-stdin</b>, and <b>--exclude-filelist-stdin</b>
       options also introduce file selection conditions. They direct rdiff-backup to read in a file, each line
       of which is a file specification, and to include or exclude the matching files. Lines are separated by
       newlines or nulls, depending on whether the <b>--null-separator</b> switch was given. Each line in a filelist is
       interpreted similarly to the way extended shell patterns are, with a few exceptions:

        1. Globbing patterns like '*', '**', '?', and '[...]' are not expanded.

        2. Include patterns do not match files in a directory that is included. So '<a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>' in an include
           file will not match '/usr/local/doc'.

        3. Lines starting with '+ [...]' (plus followed by a space) are interpreted as include directives, even
           if found in a filelist referenced by <b>--exclude-filelist</b>. Similarly, lines starting with '- [...]'
           (minus followed by a space) exclude files even if they are found within an include filelist.

       For example, if the file 'list.txt' contains the lines:

           <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>
           - /usr/local/doc
           <a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>
           + <a href="file:/var">/var</a>
           - <a href="file:/var">/var</a>

       then '--include-filelist list.txt' would include '<a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>', '<a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>', and '<a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>'. It would
       exclude '/usr/local/doc', '/usr/local/doc/python', etc. It neither excludes nor includes
       '<a href="file:/usr/local/man">/usr/local/man</a>', leaving the fate of this directory to the next specification condition. Finally, it is
       undefined what happens with '<a href="file:/var">/var</a>'. A single file list should not contain conflicting file
       specifications.

       The <b>--include-globbing-filelist</b> and <b>--exclude-globbing-filelist</b> options also specify filelists, but each
       line in the filelist will be interpreted as a globbing pattern the way <b>--include</b> and <b>--exclude</b> options
       are interpreted (although '+ ' and '- ' prefixing is still allowed). For instance, if the file
       'globbing-list.txt' contains the lines:

           dir/foo

       Then '--include-globbing-filelist globbing-list.txt' would be exactly the same as specifying on the
       command line:

           --include dir/foo --include dir/bar --exclude **

       Finally, the <b>--include-regexp</b> and <b>--exclude-regexp</b> allow files to be included and excluded if their
       filenames match a python regular expression. Regular expression syntax is too complicated to explain
       here, but is covered in Python’s library reference. Unlike the <b>--include</b> and <b>--exclude</b> options, the
       regular expression options don’t match files containing or contained in matched files. So for instance

           --include '[0-9]{7}(?!foo)'

       matches any files whose full pathnames contain 7 consecutive digits which aren’t followed by 'foo'.
       However, it wouldn’t match '<a href="file:/home">/home</a>' even if '/home/ben/1234567' existed.

</pre><h4><b>USERS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>GROUPS</b></h4><pre>
       There can be complications preserving ownership across systems. For instance the username that owns a
       file on the source system may not exist on the destination. Here is how rdiff-backup maps ownership on
       the source to the destination (or vice-versa, in the case of restoring):

        1. If the <b>--preserve-numerical-ids</b> option is given, the remote files will always have the same uid and
           gid, both for ownership and ACL entries. This may cause unames and gnames to change.

        2. Otherwise, attempt to preserve the user and group names for ownership and in ACLs. This may result in
           files having different uids and gids across systems.

        3. If a name cannot be preserved (e.g. because the username does not exist), preserve the original id,
           but only in cases of user and group ownership. For ACLs, omit any entry that has a bad user or group
           name.

        4. The <b>--user-mapping-file</b> and <b>--group-mapping-file</b> options override this behavior. If either of these
           options is given, the policy described in 2 and 3 above will be followed, but with the mapped user
           and group instead of the original. If you specify both <b>--preserve-numerical-ids</b> and one of the
           mapping options, the behavior is undefined.

       The user and group mapping files both have the same format:

           old_name_or_id1:new_name_or_id1
           old_name_or_id2:new_name_or_id2
           [...etc...]

       Each line should contain a name or id, followed by a colon ':', followed by another name or id. If a name
       or id is not listed, they are treated in the default way described above.

       When restoring, the above behavior is also followed, but note that the original source user/group
       information will be the input, not the already mapped user/group information present in the backup
       repository. For instance, suppose you have mapped all the files owned by alice in the source so that they
       are owned by ben in the repository, and now you want to restore, making sure the files owned originally
       by alice are still owned by alice. In this case there is no need to use any of the mapping options.
       However, if you wanted to restore the files so that the files originally owned by alice on the source are
       now owned by ben, you would have to use the mapping options, even though you just want the unames of the
       repository’s files preserved in the restored files.

       See USER GROUP OPTIONS for a list and description of related options.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>any-config-file</u>
           you can create a file with one option/action/sub-option per line and use it on the command line with
           an at sign prefix like <u>@any-config-file</u> and its content will be interpreted as if given on the
           command line.

           For example, creating a file 'mybackup' with following content:

               --verbosity
               5
               backup
               source_dir
               target_dir

           and calling 'rdiff-backup @mybackup' will be the same as calling 'rdiff-backup --verbosity 5 backup
           source_dir target_dir'.

       <b>session_statistics</b>, <b>file_statistics</b>
           Every session rdiff-backup saves various statistics into two files, the session statistics file at
           'rdiff-backup-data/session_statistics.{datetime}.data' and the files statistics at
           'rdiff-backup-data/directory_statistics.{datetime}.data'. They are both text files and contain
           similar information: how many files changed, how many were deleted, the total size of increment files
           created, etc. However, the session statistics file is intended to be very readable and only describes
           the session as a whole. The files statistics file is more compact (and slightly less readable) but
           describes every directory backed up. It also may be compressed to save space.

           See also STATISTICS OPTIONS and the <b>--null-separator</b> option.

       <b>backup.log</b>, <b>restore.log</b>, <b>error_log</b>
           rdiff-backup will save various messages to the log file, which is 'rdiff-backup-data/backup.log' for
           backup sessions and 'rdiff-backup-data/restore.log' for restore sessions. Generally what is written
           to this file will coincide with the messages displayed to stdout or stderr, although this can be
           changed with the <b>--terminal-verbosity</b> option.

           Errors during backup are also written to a file 'rdiff-backup-data/error_log.{datetime}.data'.

           The log files are not compressed and can become quite large if rdiff-backup is run with high
           verbosity.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       RDIFF_BACKUP_VERBOSITY=<u>[0-9]</u>
           the default verbosity for log file and terminal, can be overwritten by the corresponding options
           <b>-v/--verbosity</b> and <b>--terminal-verbosity</b>.

       RDIFF_BACKUP_DEBUG=[<u>address</u>][:<u>port</u>]
           set a non-default listening address and/or port (default is 127.0.0.1:4444) for  rpdb. Valid values
           are <u>address</u>, <u>address:port</u> or <u>:port</u>.

       RDIFF_BACKUP_API_VERSION={[<u>dictionary</u>]}
           Overwrite the 'actual', 'default', 'max' and/or 'min' value of the API VERSION using a YAML object,
           e.g. {actual: 201, default: 201}. This environment variable is rather meant for development and test
           purposes to change the values without modifying the code, so use with care.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       The following return codes have not been fully implemented so test before you rely on them. Also note
       that they can be combined, so that for example a return code 3 might be returned if a warning was found,
       then an error.

       0 - OK
           the action was completely successful

       1 - ERROR
           something fatal happened, the whole action failed

       2 - WARNING
           any kind of unexpected behavior without complete failure

       4 - FILE ERROR
           the action failed on a single file (or more), but it wasn’t the reason for a complete failure

       8 - FILE WARNING
           the action stumbled on a single file (or more), or detected differences in a comparaison

           <b>Tip</b>

           any other error code can and should be reported as a bug.
