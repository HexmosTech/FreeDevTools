</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sonic - Speech speed manipulator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sonic</b> <b>[OPTION]...</b> <b>inFile</b> <b>outFile</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sonic  is used to make wav files of speech faster or slower.  The primary advance in sonic is the ability
       to speed speech up by much more than 2X, with minimal distortion.  However, sonic can be  used  for  both
       speeding up and slowing down speech files.  Additionally, sonic can change the pitch and volume.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>     Modify  pitch  by  emulating vocal chords vibrating faster or slower.  This causes more distortion
              than the default pitch scaling, but sounds more like the same person  trying  to  talk  higher  or
              lower.   The  default  pitch  changes  makes  the voice sound like a larger or smaller person, but
              introduces little distortion.

       <b>-p</b> <b>pitch</b>
              Set pitch scaling factor.  1.3 means 30%% higher.

       <b>-q</b>     Disable all speed-up heuristics, possibly improving the quality slightly.  This is mainly used for
              debugging the speed-up heuristics.

       <b>-r</b> <b>rate</b>
              Adjust the speed of playback.  This scales both the pitch and speed equally.

       <b>-s</b> <b>speed</b>
              Set speed up factor.  1.0 means no change, 2.0 means 2X faster.

       <b>-v</b> <b>scaleFactor</b>
              Scale volume by scaleFactor.  1.5 increases by 50%.  Clips if the maximum range is exceeded.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sonic</b> <b>-s</b> <b>3.2</b> <b>book.wav</b> <b>book_fast.wav</b>

       The above command would increase the speed of an audio book called book.wav by a factor of 3.2, and write
       the result in book_fast.wav.

       <b>sonic</b> <b>-s</b> <b>0.5</b> <b>-v</b> <b>1.5</b> <b>spanish.wav</b> <b>spanish_slow.wav</b>

       This would slow down the file spanish.wav by a factor of 2, make the volume 50%  louder,  and  write  the
       result to spanish_slow.wav.

       <b>sonic</b> <b>-p</b> <b>2.0</b> <b>low.wav</b> <b>high.wav</b>

       This would make a low voice sound very high pitched.
