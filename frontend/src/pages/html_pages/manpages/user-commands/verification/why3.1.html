</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Why3 - software verification platform

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>why3</b> [<u>general</u> <u>options</u>] <u>&lt;command&gt;</u> [<u>command</u> <u>options</u>] [<u>command</u> <u>arguments</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  summarizes  basic  information about the <b>why3</b> command.  Please refer to the Reference
       Manual for complete information.

       Why3 is a platform for deductive program verification. It provides a rich language for specification  and
       programming,  called  whyml,  and  relies on external theorem provers, both automated and interactive, to
       discharge verification conditions. Why3 comes with a standard library of logical  theories  (integer  and
       real  arithmetic, Boolean operations, sets and maps, etc.) and basic programming data structures (arrays,
       queues, hash tables, etc.). A user can write whyml  programs  directly  and  get  correct-by-construction
       OCaml  programs through an automated extraction mechanism. whyml is also used as an intermediate language
       for the verification of C, Java, or Ada programs.

       <b>--help</b> same as <b>-h</b>

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>config</b> creates a why3 configuration file <u><a href="file:~/.why3.conf">~/.why3.conf</a></u>,
              containing in particular information about available provers and  plugins.  If  this  file  exists
              already,  config  will  only  reset  unset  variables to default value, but will not try to detect
              provers.

              The subcommand <b>detect</b> forces Why3 to detect again the available provers and to replace them in the
              configuration file.

              If a supported prover is installed under a name that  is  not  automatically  recognized  by  why3
              config,  the  subcommand  <b>add-prover</b> adds a specified binary to the configuration. For example, an
              Alt-Ergo executable /home/me/bin/alt-ergo-trunk can be added as follows:

                why3 config add-prover alt-ergo /home/me/bin/alt-ergo-trunk

       <b>doc</b>    produces HTML pages from Why3 source code.

       <b>execute</b>
              symbolically executes programs written in the WhyML language

       <b>extract</b>
              extracts OCaml code from programs written in the WhyML language

       <b>ide</b>    launches the graphical user interface of the why3 platform.

              There are no specific command options. However, at least one command argument must be given.  More
              precisely,  the  first  argument  must  be the directory of the session. If the directory does not
              exist, it is created. The other arguments should be existing files that are going to be  added  to
              the  session.  For  convenience,  if there is only one argument, it can be an existing file and in
              this case the session directory is obtained by removing the extension from the file name.

       <b>prove</b>  launches <b>why3</b> in batch mode on a an input file

       <b>realize</b>
              produces skeleton files for proof assistants

       <b>replay</b> executes the proofs stored in a Why3 session file, as produced by the IDE.

       <b>session</b>

       <b>wc</b>     produces statistics about Why3 and WhyML source codes.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       The information on this manpage was extracted from the complete Why3 reference manual.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       On a debian system, the full documentation for <b>why3</b> is distributed in PDF and HTML format in the packages
       <b>why3-doc-html</b> and <b>why3-doc-pdf</b>.  It is also available from the why3 homepage &lt;<a href="http://why3.lri.fr">http://why3.lri.fr</a>&gt;.
