</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       exult_studio - a world editor for Exult

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>exult_studio</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>exult_studio</b> can be used to view graphics and map snippets of Exult games. Used in conjunction with <b>exult</b>
       the map can be changed as well.

       Currently  it  is  not feasable to create a game from scratch. You must point <b>exult_studio</b> at an existing
       game instead, either via the <b>-d</b> commandline option (see below), or by selecting  <u>Open</u>  <u>static...</u>  in  the
       <u>File</u> menu. The latter will pop up a file requester, where you can choose an appropriate directory.

       Once an appropriate directory has been located, a tree of game files is displayed to the left of the main
       window,  while the currently selected file is viewed in detail to the right. At the moment, the following
       types of files are supported:

   <b>Shape</b> <b>files</b>
       <u>Shapes</u> are the basic graphical elements of the game. Each shape has one or  more  frames  that  typically
       represent  different  states  or  angles  of  the  same  thing. E.g. a button shape could have frames for
       pressed, and released; a character could have frames depicting her sitting, standing up facing  one  way,
       or another, swinging a punch, etc.

       When  a  shape  file  is  selected,  the right part of the main window will show frame zero of the shapes
       contained therein. Shapes can be selected by clicking, which will show there number,  number  of  frames,
       and name if known. Other frames can be viewed by changing the frame number.

   <b>Map</b> <b>files</b>
       These files contain so called <u>chunks</u> that serve as templates in the final map. The chunks of the selected
       map file are shown to the right of the main window.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b> <u>DIRECTORY</u>
              specifies <u>DIRECTORY</u> as the game base directory.

       <b>-x</b> <u>DIRECTORY</u>
              tells  <b>exult_studio</b> to look in DIRECTORY for its user-interface specification. This option is only
              useful to developers.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/usr/share/exult/exult_studio.glade</b>
              Default location of the user-interface specification.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       For more help and information with <b>exult_studio</b> go to:

       <a href="http://exult.sourceforge.net/">http://exult.sourceforge.net/</a>

       <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/exult/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/exult/</a>

       Editing a copyrighted game may or may not be allowed. Please exercise caution.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Closing the directory selector (via Ok or Cancel) induces a crash.  Double clicking the directory  works,
       just move the selector out of the way after that.

       Invalid arguments to commandline options will not be taken lightly.  Avoid that for now.

       More bugs? Surely! Please report them at:

       (Be  sure  to  mention information about your operating system, and which version of <b>exult_studio</b> you are
       running!)

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>exult_studio</b> started it's life as a map-browser for Ultima VII and has evolved from there, thanks to  the
       open source-model, and contributions of time and code from many people.
