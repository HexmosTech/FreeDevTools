</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       goaccess - fast web log analyzer and interactive viewer.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>goaccess</b> <b>[filename]</b> <b>[options...]</b> <b>[-c][-M][-H][-q][-d][...]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>goaccess</b>  GoAccess  is  an  open  source real-time web log analyzer and interactive viewer that runs in a
       <u>terminal</u> in *nix systems or through your <u>browser.</u>

       It provides fast and valuable HTTP statistics for system administrators  that  require  a  visual  server
       report on the fly.

       GoAccess parses the specified web log file and outputs the data to the X terminal. Features include:

       General Statistics:
              This  panel  gives a summary of several metrics, such as the number of valid and invalid requests,
              time taken to analyze the dataset, unique visitors, requested files, static files (CSS, ICO,  JPG,
              etc) HTTP referrers, 404s, size of the parsed log file and bandwidth consumption.

       Unique visitors
              This  panel  shows  metrics  such as hits, unique visitors and cumulative bandwidth per date. HTTP
              requests containing the same IP, the same date, and the same user agent are  considered  a  unique
              visitor. By default, it includes web crawlers/spiders.

              Optionally,  date specificity can be set to the hour level using <u>--date-spec=hr</u> which will display
              dates such as 05/Jun/2016:16, or to the minute level producing 05/Jun/2016:16:59. This is great if
              you want to track your daily traffic at the hour or minute level.

       Requested files
              This panel displays the most requested (non-static) files on your  web  server.   It  shows  hits,
              unique  visitors,  and  percentage, along with the cumulative bandwidth, protocol, and the request
              method used.

       Requested static files
              Lists the most frequently static files such as: JPG, CSS, SWF, JS, GIF, and PNG file types,  along
              with the same metrics as the last panel. Additional static files can be added to the configuration
              file.

       404 or Not Found
              Displays  the  same  metrics  as the previous request panels, however, its data contains all pages
              that were not found on the server, or commonly known as 404 status code.

       Hosts  This panel has detailed information on the hosts themselves. This is great for spotting aggressive
              crawlers and identifying who's eating your bandwidth.

              Expanding the panel can display more information such as host's reverse DNS lookup result, country
              of origin and city. If the <u>-a</u> argument is enabled, a list of  user  agents  can  be  displayed  by
              selecting the desired IP address, and then pressing ENTER.

       Operating Systems
              This panel will report which operating system the host used when it hit the server. It attempts to
              provide the most specific version of each operating system.

       Browsers
              This  panel will report which browser the host used when it hit the server. It attempts to provide
              the most specific version of each browser.

       Visit Times
              This panel will display an hourly report. This option displays 24 data points, one for  each  hour
              of the day.

              Optionally,  hour specificity can be set to the tenth of an hour level using <u>--hour-spec=min</u> which
              will display hours as 16:4 This is great if you want to spot peaks of traffic on your server.

       Virtual Hosts
              This panel will display all the different virtual hosts parsed from the access log. This panel  is
              displayed if <u>%v</u> is used within the log-format string.

       Referrers URLs
              If the host in question accessed the site via another resource, or was linked/diverted to you from
              another host, the URL they were referred from will be provided in this panel. See `--ignore-panel`
              in your configuration file to enable it.  <u>disabled</u> by default.

       Referring Sites
              This  panel  will display only the host part but not the whole URL. The URL where the request came
              from.

       Keyphrases
              It reports keyphrases used on Google search, Google cache, and Google translate that have lead  to
              your web server. At present, it only supports Google search queries via HTTP. See `--ignore-panel`
              in your configuration file to enable it.  <u>disabled</u> by default.

       Geo Location
              Determines  where an IP address is geographically located. Statistics are broken down by continent
              and country. It needs to be compiled with GeoLocation support.

       HTTP Status Codes
              The values of the numeric status code to HTTP requests.

       ASN    This panel displays ASN (Autonomous System Numbers) data for GeoIP2 and  legacy  databases.  Great
              for detecting malicious traffic and blocking accordingly.

       Remote User (HTTP authentication)
              This  is the userid of the person requesting the document as determined by HTTP authentication. If
              the document is not password protected, this part will be "-" just like  the  previous  one.  This
              panel is not enabled unless <u>%e</u> is given within the log-format variable.

       Cache Status
              If  you  are  using caching on your server, you may be at the point where you want to know if your
              request is being cached and served from the cache. This panel shows the cache status of the object
              the server served. This panel is not enabled unless <u>%C</u> is given within  the  log-format  variable.
              The status can be either
               `MISS`, `BYPASS`, `EXPIRED`, `STALE`, `UPDATING`, `REVALIDATED` or `HIT`

       MIME Types
              This  panel  specifies Media Types (formerly known as MIME types) and Media Subtypes which will be
              assigned and listed underneath. This panel is not enabled unless <u>%M</u> is given within the log-format
              variable. See https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml for more details.

       Encryption Settings
              This panel shows the SSL/TLS protocol used along the Cipher Suites.  This  panel  is  not  enabled
              unless <u>%K</u> is given within the log-format variable.

       <u>NOTE:</u> Optionally and if configured, all panels can display the average time taken to serve the request.

</pre><h4><b>STORAGE</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  three  storage  options  that  can  be  used  with GoAccess. Choosing one will depend on your
       environment and needs.

       Default Hash Tables
              In-memory storage provides better performance at the cost of limiting  the  dataset  size  to  the
              amount  of available physical memory. GoAccess uses in-memory hash tables. It has very good memory
              usage and pretty good performance. This storage has support for on-disk persistence.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Multiple options can be used to configure GoAccess. For a complete up-to-date list of configure  options,
       run <u>./configure</u> <u>--help</u>

       <b>--enable-debug</b>
              Compile with debugging symbols and turn off compiler optimizations.

       <b>--enable-utf8</b>
              Compile with wide character support. Ncursesw is required.

       <b>--enable-geoip=&lt;legacy|mmdb&gt;</b>
              Compile  with  GeoLocation support. MaxMind's GeoIP is required.  <u>legacy</u> will utilize the original
              GeoIP databases.  <u>mmdb</u> will utilize the enhanced GeoIP2 databases.

       <b>--with-getline</b>
              Dynamically expands line buffer in order to parse full line requests instead of using a fixed size
              buffer of 4096.

       <b>--with-openssl</b>
              Compile GoAccess with OpenSSL support for its WebSocket server.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options can be supplied to the command or specified in the configuration file. If specified
       in the configuration file, long options need to be used without prepending -- and without using the equal
       sign =.

   <b>LOG/DATE/TIME</b> <b>FORMAT</b>
       <b>--time-format=&lt;timeformat&gt;</b>
              The time-format variable followed by a space, specifies the log format time  containing  either  a
              name  of  a  predefined  format  (see  options below) or any combination of regular characters and
              special format specifiers.

              They all begin with a percentage (%) sign. See `man strftime`.  <u>%T</u> <u>or</u> <u>%H:%M:%S.</u>

              Note that if a timestamp is given in microseconds,  <u>%f</u>  must  be  used  as  time-format.   If  the
              timestamp is given in milliseconds <u>%*</u> must be used as time-format.

       <b>--date-format=&lt;dateformat&gt;</b>
              The  date-format  variable  followed by a space, specifies the log format time containing either a
              name of a predefined format (see options below) or  any  combination  of  regular  characters  and
              special format specifiers.

              They all begin with a percentage (%) sign. See `man strftime`.  <u>%Y-%m-%d.</u>

              Note  that  if  a  timestamp  is  given  in  microseconds, <u>%f</u> must be used as date-format.  If the
              timestamp is given in milliseconds <u>%*</u> must be used as date-format.

       <b>--datetime-format=&lt;date_time_format&gt;</b>
              The date and time format combines the two variables into a single option. This gives  the  ability
              to  get  the  timezone  from  a  request  and  convert  it  to  another  timezone  for output. See
              <u>--tz=&lt;timezone&gt;</u>

              They all begin with a percentage (%) sign. See `man strftime`. e.g., <u>%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S</u> <u>%z.</u>

              Note that if --datetime-format is used, <u>%x</u> must be passed in the log-format variable to  represent
              the date and time field.

       <b>--log-format=&lt;logformat&gt;</b>
              The  log-format  variable  followed  by  a space or <u>\t</u> for tab-delimited, specifies the log format
              string.

              Note that if there are spaces within the format, the string needs to be enclosed in  single/double
              quotes. Inner quotes need to be escaped.

              In  addition  to  specifying  the  raw log/date/time formats, for simplicity, any of the following
              predefined log format names can be supplied to the log/date/time-format  variables.  GoAccess  can
              also handle one predefined name in one variable and another predefined name in another variable.

                COMBINED     - Combined Log Format,
                VCOMBINED    - Combined Log Format with Virtual Host,
                COMMON       - Common Log Format,
                VCOMMON      - Common Log Format with Virtual Host,
                W3C          - W3C Extended Log File Format,

                AWSALB       - Amazon Application Load Balancer
                CADDY        - Caddy's JSON Structured format (local/info format)
                TRAEFIKCLF   - Traefik's CLF flavor

              <u>Note:</u>  Generally,  you need quotes around values that include white spaces, commas, pipes, quotes,
              and/or brackets. Inner quotes must be escaped.

              <u>Note:</u> Piping data into GoAccess won't prompt a log/date/time configuration dialog, you  will  need
              to previously define it in your configuration file or in the command line.

              <u>Note:</u>  The  default GoAccess format for CADDY is the 'local/info' format. Nevertheless, if needed,
              you  have  the  option  to  utilize  a  custom  GoAccess  log  format  to  match  your  particular
              configuration.

   <b>USER</b> <b>INTERFACE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-c</b> <b>--config-dialog</b>
              Prompt log/time/date configuration window on program start. Only when curses is initialized.

               BG# = background color [-1...255] (-1 = default term color)

              Optionally,  it  is  possible to apply color attributes (multiple attributes are comma separated),
              such as: <u>bold,</u> <u>underline,</u> <u>normal,</u> <u>reverse,</u> <u>blink</u>

              If desired, it is possible to apply custom colors per panel, that is, a  metric  in  the  REQUESTS

       <b>--color-scheme=&lt;1|2|3&gt;</b>
              Choose  among  color  schemes.  <u>1</u> for the default grey scheme.  <u>2</u> for the green scheme.  <u>3</u> for the
              Monokai scheme (shown only if terminal supports 256 colors).

       <b>--crawlers-only</b>
              Parse and display only crawlers (bots).

       <b>--html-custom-css=&lt;path/custom.css&gt;</b>
              Specifies a custom CSS file path to load in the HTML report.

       <b>--html-custom-js=&lt;path/custom.js&gt;</b>
              Specifies a custom JS file path to load in the HTML report.

       <b>--html-report-title=&lt;title&gt;</b>
              Set HTML report page title and header.

       <b>--html-refresh=&lt;secs&gt;</b>
              Refresh the HTML report every X seconds. The value has to be between 1 and 60 seconds. The default
              is set to refresh the HTML report every 1 second.

       <b>--html-prefs=&lt;JSON&gt;</b>
              Set HTML report default preferences. Supply a valid JSON object containing the  HTML  preferences.
              It allows the ability to customize each panel plot. See example below.

              <u>Note:</u> The JSON object passed needs to be a one line JSON string. For instance,

              --html-prefs='{"theme":"bright","perPage":5,"layout":"horizontal","showTables":true,"visitors":{"plot":{"chartType":"bar"}}}'

       <b>--json-pretty-print</b>
              Format JSON output using tabs and newlines.

              <u>Note:</u>  This is not recommended when outputting a real-time HTML report since the WebSocket payload
              will much much larger.

       <b>--max-items=&lt;number&gt;</b>
              The maximum number of items to display per panel. The maximum can be a number between 1 and n.

              <u>Note:</u> Only the CSV and JSON output allow a maximum number greater than the default  value  of  366
              (or 50 in the real-time HTML output) items per panel.

       <b>--no-color</b>
              Turn off colored output. This is the default output on terminals that do not support colors.

       <b>--no-column-names</b>
              Don't  write  column  names  in the terminal output. By default, it displays column names for each
              available metric in every panel.

       <b>--no-csv-summary</b>
              Disable summary metrics on the CSV output.

       <b>--no-progress</b>
              Disable progress metrics [total requests/requests per second].

       <b>--no-tab-scroll</b>
              Disable scrolling through panels when TAB is pressed or when a panel is selected using  a  numeric
              key.

       <b>--no-html-last-updated</b>
              Do not show the last updated field displayed in the HTML generated report.

       <b>--no-parsing-spinner</b>
              Do now show the progress metrics and parsing spinner.

       <b>--tz=&lt;timezone&gt;</b>
              Outputs  the report date/time data in the given timezone. Note that it uses the canonical timezone
              name. e.g., <u>Europe/Berlin</u> or <u>America/Chicago</u> or <u>Africa/Cairo</u> If an invalid timezone name is given,
              the output will be in GMT. See <u>--datetime-format</u> in order to properly specify a  timezone  in  the
              date/time format.

   <b>SERVER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <u>Note</u> This is just a WebSocket server to provide the raw real-time data.  It is not a WebServer itself. To
       access  your  reports  html file, you will still need your own HTTP server, place the generated report in
       it's document root dir and open the html file in  your  browser.  The  browser  will  then  open  another
       WebSocket-connection to the ws-server you may setup here, to keep the dashboard up-to-date.

       <b>--addr</b> Specify IP address to bind the server to. Otherwise it binds to 0.0.0.0.

              Usually  there  is no need to specify the address, unless you intentionally would like to bind the
              server to a different address within your server.

       <b>--daemonize</b>
              Run GoAccess as daemon (only if <b>--real-time-html</b> <b>enabled).</b>

              Note: It's important to make use of absolute paths across GoAccess' configuration.

       <b>--user-name=&lt;username&gt;</b>
              Run GoAccess as the specified user.

              Note: It's important to ensure the user or the users' group can access the input and output  files
              as  well  as  any  other files needed.  Other groups the user belongs to will be ignored.  As such
              it's advised to run GoAccess behind a SSL proxy as it's unlikely this  user  can  access  the  SSL
              certificates.

       <b>--origin=&lt;url&gt;</b>
              Ensure clients send the specified origin header upon the WebSocket handshake.

       <b>--pid-file=&lt;path/goaccess.pid&gt;</b>
              Write the daemon PID to a file when used along the --daemonize option.

       <b>--port=&lt;port&gt;</b>
              Specify the port to use. By default GoAccess' WebSocket server listens on port 7890.

       <b>--real-time-html</b>
              Enable real-time HTML output.

              GoAccess  uses  its  own  WebSocket  server  to  push  the data from the server to the client. See
              <a href="http://gwsocket.io">http://gwsocket.io</a> for more details how the WebSocket server works.

       <b>--ws-url=&lt;[scheme://]url[:port]&gt;</b>
              URL to which the WebSocket server responds. This is the URL supplied to the WebSocket  constructor
              on the client side.

              Optionally,  it  is  possible  to  specify  the  WebSocket URI scheme, such as <u>ws://</u> or <u>wss://</u> for
              unencrypted and encrypted connections. e.g., <u>wss://goaccess.io</u>

              If GoAccess is running behind a proxy, you could set the client side to  connect  to  a  different
              port by specifying the host followed by a colon and the port.  e.g., <u>goaccess.io:9999</u>

              By  default, it will attempt to connect to the generated report's hostname. If GoAccess is running
              on a remote server, the host of the remote server should be specified here. Also, make sure it  is
              a valid host and NOT an http address.

       <b>--ping-interval=&lt;secs&gt;</b>
              Enable  WebSocket  ping  with  specified  interval in seconds. This helps prevent idle connections
              getting disconnected.

       <b>--fifo-in=&lt;path/file&gt;</b>
              Creates a named pipe (FIFO) that reads from on the given path/file.

       <b>--fifo-out=&lt;path/file&gt;</b>
              Creates a named pipe (FIFO) that writes to the given path/file.

       <b>--ssl-cert=&lt;cert.crt&gt;</b>
              Path to TLS/SSL certificate. In order to enable TLS/SSL support, GoAccess requires that --ssl-cert
              and --ssl-key are used.

              Only if configured using --with-openssl

       <b>--ssl-key=&lt;priv.key&gt;</b>
              Path to TLS/SSL private key. In order to enable TLS/SSL support, GoAccess requires that --ssl-cert
              and --ssl-key are used.

              Only if configured using --with-openssl

   <b>FILE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-</b>      The log file to parse is read from stdin.

       <b>-f</b> <b>--log-file=&lt;logfile&gt;</b>
              Specify the path to the input log file. If set in the config file, it will take priority  over  -f
              from the command line.

       <b>-S</b> <b>--log-size=&lt;bytes&gt;</b>
              Specify  the log size in bytes. This is useful when piping in logs for processing in which the log
              size can be explicitly set.

       <b>-l</b> <b>--debug-file=&lt;debugfile&gt;</b>
              Send all debug messages to the specified file.

       <b>-p</b> <b>--config-file=&lt;configfile&gt;</b>
              Specify a custom configuration file to use.  If  set,  it  will  take  priority  over  the  global
              configuration file (if any).

       <b>--external-assets</b>
              Output  HTML  assets to external JS/CSS files. Great if you are setting up Content Security Policy
              (CSP). This will create two separate files, <u>goaccess.js</u> and <u>goaccess.css</u> , in the  same  directory
              as your report.html file.

       <b>--invalid-requests=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Log invalid requests to the specified file.

       <b>--unknowns-log=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Log unknown browsers and OSs to the specified file.

       <b>--no-global-config</b>
              Do  not  load  the  global  configuration  file. This directory should normally be <a href="file:/usr/local/etc">/usr/local/etc</a>,
              unless specified with <u>--sysconfdir=/dir.</u>  See --dcf option for finding the  default  configuration
              file.

   <b>PARSE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-a</b> <b>--agent-list</b>
              Enable a list of user-agents by host. For faster parsing, do not enable this flag.

       <b>-d</b> <b>--with-output-resolver</b>
              Enable IP resolver on HTML|JSON output.

       <b>-e</b> <b>--exclude-ip=&lt;IP|IP-range&gt;</b>
              Exclude  an  IPv4 or IPv6 from being counted. Applicable solely during access log data processing,
              it does not exclude persisted data.  Ranges can be included as well using a dash  in  between  the
              IPs (start-end).

              <u>Examples:</u>
                exclude-ip 127.0.0.1
                exclude-ip 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.100
                exclude-ip ::1
                exclude-ip 0:0:0:0:0:ffff:808:804-0:0:0:0:0:ffff:808:808

       <b>-j</b> <b>--jobs=&lt;1-6&gt;</b>
              This  specifies  the  number of parallel processing threads to be used during the execution of the
              program. It determines the degree of concurrency when analyzing log data,  allowing  for  parallel
              processing  of  multiple  tasks  simultaneously.  It  defaults to 1 thread. It's common to set the
              number of jobs based on the available hardware resources, such as the number of CPU cores.

       <b>-H</b> <b>--http-protocol=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Set/unset HTTP request protocol. This will create a request key containing the request protocol  +
              the actual request.

       <b>-M</b> <b>--http-method=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Set/unset  HTTP request method. This will create a request key containing the request method + the
              actual request.

       <b>-o</b> <b>--output=&lt;path/file.[json|csv|html]&gt;</b>
              Write output to stdout given one of the following files and the corresponding  extension  for  the
              output format:

                /path/file.csv - Comma-separated values (CSV)
                /path/file.json - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
                /path/file.html - HTML

       <b>-q</b> <b>--no-query-string</b>
              Ignore request's query string. i.e., www.google.com/page.htm?query =&gt; www.google.com/page.htm.

              <u>Note:</u> Removing the query string can greatly decrease memory consumption, especially on timestamped
              requests.

       <b>-r</b> <b>--no-term-resolver</b>
              Disable IP resolver on terminal output.

       <b>--444-as-404</b>
              Treat non-standard status code 444 as 404.

       <b>--4xx-to-unique-count</b>
              Add 4xx client errors to the unique visitors count.

       <b>--anonymize-ip</b>
              Anonymize  the  client IP address. The IP anonymization option sets the last octet of IPv4 user IP
              addresses and the last 80 bits of IPv6 addresses to zeros.  e.g., 192.168.20.100  =&gt;  192.168.20.0
              e.g., 2a03:2880:2110:df07:face:b00c::1 =&gt; 2a03:2880:2110:df07::

              <u>Note:</u> This deactivates -a.

       <b>--chunk-size=&lt;256-32768&gt;</b>
              This  determines  the number of lines that form a chunk. This parameter influences the size of the
              data processed concurrently by each thread, allowing for parallelization of the file  reading  and
              processing  tasks.  The  value of chunk-size affects the efficiency of the parallel processing and
              can be adjusted based on factors such as system resources and the  characteristics  of  the  input
              data.

              Low Values: If chunk-size is set too low, it might result in inefficient processing. For instance,
              if  each  chunk  contains  a very small number of lines, the overhead of managing and coordinating
              parallel processing might outweigh the benefits.

              Large Values: Conversely, if chunk-size is set too high, it could  lead  to  resource  exhaustion.
              Each chunk represents a portion of data that a thread processes in parallel. Setting chunk-size to
              an  excessively  large  value  might  cause memory issues, particularly if there are many parallel
              threads running simultaneously.

       <b>--anonymize-level</b>
              Specifies the anonymization levels: 1 =&gt; default, 2 =&gt; strong, 3 =&gt; pedantic.
              ┌─────────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
              │ <b>Bits-hidden</b> │ <b>Level</b> <b>1</b> │ <b>Level</b> <b>2</b> │ <b>Level</b> <b>3</b> │

       <b>--all-static-files</b>
              Include static files that contain a query string. e.g., /fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff?v=4.0.3

       <b>--browsers-file=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              By default GoAccess parses an "essential/basic" curated list of browsers &amp; crawlers. If  you  need
              to   add  additional  browsers,  use  this  option.   Include  an  additional  delimited  list  of
              browsers/crawlers/feeds    etc.     See     config/browsers.list     for     an     example     or
              https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allinurl/goaccess/master/config/browsers.list

       <b>--date-spec=&lt;date|hr|min&gt;</b>
              Set  the  date specificity to either date (default), hr to display hours or min to display minutes
              appended to the date.

              This is used in the visitors panel. It's useful for tracking  visitors  at  the  hour  level.  For
              instance,  an  hour  specificity  would  yield  to  display  traffic  as  18/Dec/2010:19 or minute
              specificity 18/Dec/2010:19:59.

       <b>--double-decode</b>
              Decode double-encoded values. This includes, user-agent, request, and referrer.

       <b>--enable-panel=&lt;PANEL&gt;</b>
              Enable parsing and displaying the given panel.

       <b>--fname-as-vhost=&lt;regex&gt;</b>
              Use log filename(s) as virtual host(s). POSIX regex is passed to extract the virtual host from the
              filename. e.g.,  <u>--fname-as-vhost='[a-z]*.[a-z]*'</u>  can  be  used  to  extract  awesome.com.log  =&gt;
              awesome.com.

       <b>--hide-referrer=&lt;NEEDLE&gt;</b>
              Hide a referrer but still count it. Wild cards are allowed in the needle. i.e., *.bing.com.

       <b>--hour-spec=&lt;hr|min&gt;</b>
              Set  the time specificity to either hour (default) or min to display the tenth of an hour appended
              to the hour.

              This is used in the time distribution panel. It's useful for tracking peaks  of  traffic  on  your

                Only ignore request from valid requests

              <u>panels</u>
                Ignore request from panels.

                Note that it will count them towards the total number of requests

       <b>--ignore-status=&lt;CODE&gt;</b>
              Ignore  parsing and displaying one or multiple status code(s). For multiple status codes, use this
              option multiple times.

       <b>--keep-last=&lt;num_days&gt;</b>
              Keep the last specified number of days in storage. This will recycle  the  storage  tables.  e.g.,
              keep &amp; show only the last 7 days.

       <b>--no-ip-validation</b>
              Disable  client  IP  validation.  Useful if IP addresses have been obfuscated before being logged.
              The log still needs to contain a placeholder for <u>%h</u> usually it's a resolved IP. e.g.  <u>ord37s19-in-</u>
              <u>f14.1e100.net.</u>

       <b>--no-strict-status</b>
              Disable HTTP status code validation. Some servers would record this value only if a connection was
              established to the target and the target sent a response.  Otherwise, it could be recorded as -.

       <b>--num-tests=&lt;number&gt;</b>
              Number of lines from the access log to test against the provided log/date/time format. By default,
              the parser is set to test 10 lines. If set to 0, the parser won't test any lines  and  will  parse
              the whole access log. If a line matches the given log/date/time format before it reaches <u>&lt;number&gt;,</u>
              the  parser  will  consider  the  log to be valid, otherwise GoAccess will return EXIT_FAILURE and
              display the relevant error messages.

       <b>--process-and-exit</b>
              Parse log and exit without outputting data. Useful if we are looking to only add new data  to  the
              on-disk database without outputting to a file or a terminal.

   <b>GEOLOCATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-g</b> <b>--std-geoip</b>
              Standard GeoIP database for less memory usage.

       <b>--geoip-database=&lt;geofile&gt;</b>
              Specify path to GeoIP database file. i.e., GeoLiteCity.dat.

              If using GeoIP2, you will need to download the GeoLite2 City or Country database from  MaxMind.com
              and  use  the  option  --geoip-database to specify the database. You can also get updated database
              files for GeoIP legacy, you can find these as GeoLite Legacy Databases from MaxMind.com. IPv4  and
              IPv6  files  are  supported  as  well.  For  updated  DB  URLs,  please  see  the default GoAccess
              configuration file.

              <u>Note:</u> --geoip-city-data is an alias of --geoip-database.

   <b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-h</b> <b>--help</b>

       <b>--dcf</b>  Display the path of the default config file when `-p` is not used.

   <b>PERSISTENCE</b> <b>STORAGE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--persist</b>
              Persist parsed data into disk. If database files exist, files will be overwritten. This should  be
              set to the first dataset. See examples below.

       <b>--restore</b>
              Load  previously stored data from disk. If reading persisted data only, the database files need to
              exist. See <u>--persist</u> and examples below.

       <b>--db-path=&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Path where the on-disk database files are stored. The default value is the <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> directory.

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOM</b> <b>LOG/DATE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       GoAccess can parse virtually any web log format.

       Predefined options include, Common Log Format (CLF), Combined Log  Format  (XLF/ELF),  including  virtual
       host, Amazon CloudFront (Download Distribution), Google Cloud Storage and W3C format (IIS).

       GoAccess allows any custom format string as well.

       There  are  two  ways  to  configure  the log format.  The easiest is to run GoAccess with <u>-c</u> to prompt a
       configuration window. Otherwise, it can be configured under <a href="file:~/.goaccessrc">~/.goaccessrc</a> or the %sysconfdir%.

       time-format
              The <u>time-format</u> variable followed by a  space,  specifies  the  log  format  time  containing  any
              combination of regular characters and special format specifiers.  They all begin with a percentage
              (%) sign. See `man strftime`.  <u>%T</u> <u>or</u> <u>%H:%M:%S.</u>

              <u>Note:</u>  If  a  timestamp  is  given  in  microseconds,  <u>%f</u> must be used as <u>time-format</u> or <u>%*</u> if the
              timestamp is given in milliseconds.

       date-format
              The <u>date-format</u> variable followed by a  space,  specifies  the  log  format  date  containing  any
              combination  of regular characters and special format specifiers. They all begin with a percentage
              (%) sign. See `man strftime`. e.g., <u>%Y-%m-%d.</u>

              <u>Note:</u> If a timestamp is given in microseconds, <u>%f</u> must  be  used  as  <u>date-format</u>  or  <u>%*</u>  if  the
              timestamp is given in milliseconds.

       log-format
              The <u>log-format</u> variable followed by a space or <u>\t</u> , specifies the log format string.

       %x     A  date and time field matching the <u>time-format</u> and <u>date-format</u> variables. This is used when given
              a timestamp or the date  &amp;  time  are  concatenated  as  a  single  string  (e.g.,  1501647332  or
              20170801235000) instead of the date and time being in two separated variables.

       %t     time field matching the <u>time-format</u> variable.

       %d     date field matching the <u>date-format</u> variable.

       %v     The canonical Server Name of the server serving the request (Virtual Host).

       %e     This is the userid of the person requesting the document as determined by HTTP authentication.

       %C     The cache status of the object the server served.

       %h     host (the client IP address, either IPv4 or IPv6)

       %r     The  request line from the client. This requires specific delimiters around the request (as single
              quotes, double quotes, or anything else) to be parsable. If not, we have to use a  combination  of
              special format specifiers as %m %U %H.

       %q     The query string.

       %m     The request method.

       %U     The URL path requested.

              <u>Note:</u>  If  the  query string is in %U, there is no need to use <u>%q.</u>  However, if the URL path, does
              not include any query string, you may use <u>%q</u> and the query string will be appended to the request.

       %H     The request protocol.

       %s     The status code that the server sends back to the client.

       %b     The size of the object returned to the client.

       %R     The "Referrer" HTTP request header.

       %u     The user-agent HTTP request header.

       %K     The TLS encryption settings chosen for the connection. (In Apache LogFormat: %{SSL_PROTOCOL}x)

       %k     The TLS encryption settings chosen for the connection. (In Apache LogFormat: %{SSL_CIPHER}x)

       %M     The MIME-type of the requested resource. (In Apache LogFormat: %{Content-Type}o)

       %D     The time taken to serve the request, in microseconds as a decimal number.

       %T     The time taken to serve the request, in seconds with milliseconds resolution.

       %L     The time taken to serve the request, in milliseconds as a decimal number.

       %n     The time taken to serve the request, in nanoseconds.

       %^     Ignore this field.

       %~     Move forward through the log string until a non-space (!isspace) char is found.

       ~h     The host (the client IP address, either IPv4 or IPv6) in a X-Forwarded-For (XFF) field.

              It uses a special specifier which consists of a tilde before the host specifier, followed  by  the
              character(s) that delimit the XFF field, which are enclosed by curly braces. i.e., "~h{, }

              For  example,  "~h{,  }"  is  used  in  order  to  parse "11.25.11.53, 17.68.33.17" field which is
              delimited by a comma and a space (enclosed by double quotes).

              ┌──────────────────────────────────────┬───────────┐

       <u>Note:</u> In order to get the average, cumulative and maximum time served in GoAccess, you will need to start
       logging response times in your web server. In Nginx you can add <u>$request_time</u> to your log format,  or  <u>%D</u>
       in Apache.

       <u>Important:</u>  If  multiple  time served specifiers are used at the same time, the first option specified in
       the format string will take priority over the other specifiers.

       GoAccess <u>requires</u> the following fields:

              <u>%h</u> a valid IPv4/6

              <u>%d</u> a valid date

              <u>%r</u> the request

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Note:</u> Piping data into GoAccess won't prompt a log/date/time  configuration  dialog,  you  will  need  to
       previously define it in your configuration file or in the command line.

   <b>DIFFERENT</b> <b>OUTPUTS</b>
       To output to a terminal and generate an interactive report:

              # goaccess access.log

       To generate an HTML report:

              # goaccess access.log -a -o report.html

       To generate a JSON report:

              # goaccess access.log -a -d -o report.json

       To generate a CSV file:

              # goaccess access.log --no-csv-summary -o report.csv

       GoAccess  also  allows  great  flexibility  for real-time filtering and parsing. For instance, to quickly
       diagnose issues by monitoring logs since goaccess was started:

              # tail -f access.log | goaccess -

       And even better, to filter while maintaining opened a pipe to preserve real-time analysis,  we  can  make
       use of <u>tail</u> <u>-f</u> and a matching pattern tool such as <u>grep,</u> <u>awk,</u> <u>sed,</u> etc:

              # tail -f access.log | grep -i --line-buffered 'firefox' | goaccess --log-format=COMBINED -

       or to parse from the beginning of the file while maintaining the pipe opened and applying a filter

              # tail -f -n +0 access.log | grep -i --line-buffered 'firefox' | goaccess --log-format=COMBINED -o
              report.html --real-time-html -

       or to convert the log date timezone to a different timezone, e.g., Europe/Berlin

              #   goaccess   access.log   --log-format='%h   %^[%x]   "%r"   %s   %b   "%R"   "%u"'  --datetime-
              format='%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z' --tz=Europe/Berlin --date-spec=min

   <b>MULTIPLE</b> <b>LOG</b> <b>FILES</b>
       There are several ways to parse multiple logs with GoAccess. The simplest is to pass multiple  log  files
       to the command line:

              # goaccess access.log access.log.1

       It's even possible to parse files from a pipe while reading regular files:

              # cat access.log.2 | goaccess access.log access.log.1 -

       <u>Note</u>  that  the single dash is appended to the command line to let GoAccess know that it should read from
       the pipe.

       Now if we want to add more flexibility to GoAccess, we can do a series of  pipes.  For  instance,  if  we
       would  like  to  process all compressed log files <u>access.log.*.gz</u> in addition to the current log file, we
       can do:

              # zcat access.log.*.gz | goaccess access.log -

       <u>Note:</u> On Mac OS X, use gunzip -c instead of zcat.

   <b>REAL</b> <b>TIME</b> <b>HTML</b> <b>OUTPUT</b>
       GoAccess has the ability to output real-time data in the HTML report. You can even email  the  HTML  file
       since it is composed of a single file with no external file dependencies, how neat is that!

       The  process  of  generating  a real-time HTML report is very similar to the process of creating a static
       report. Only --real-time-html is needed to make it real-time.

              # goaccess access.log -o /usr/share/nginx/html/site/report.html --real-time-html

       By default, GoAccess will use the host name of the generated report.  Optionally, you can specify the URL
       to which the client's browser will connect to. See https://goaccess.io/faq for a more detailed example.

              # goaccess access.log -o report.html --real-time-html --ws-url=goaccess.io

       By default, GoAccess listens on port 7890, to use a different port other than 7890, you can specify it as
       (make sure the port is opened):

              # goaccess access.log -o report.html --real-time-html --port=9870

       And to bind the WebSocket server to a different address other than 0.0.0.0, you can specify it as:

              # goaccess access.log -o report.html --real-time-html --addr=127.0.0.1

       <u>Note:</u> To output real time data over a TLS/SSL connection,  you  need  to  use  <u>--ssl-cert=&lt;cert.crt&gt;</u>  and
       <u>--ssl-key=&lt;priv.key&gt;.</u>

   <b>WORKING</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>DATES</b>
       Another useful pipe would be filtering dates out of the web log

       The following will get all HTTP requests starting on 05/Dec/2010 until the end of the file.

              # sed -n '/05Dec2010/,$ p' access.log | goaccess -a -

       or using relative dates such as yesterdays or tomorrows day:

              # sed -n '/'$(date '+%d%b%Y' -d '1 week ago')'/,$ p' access.log | goaccess -a -

       If we want to parse only a certain time-frame from DATE a to DATE b, we can do:

              # sed -n '/5Nov2010/,/5Dec2010/ p' access.log | goaccess -a -

       If we want to preserve only certain amount of data and recycle storage, we can keep only a certain number
       of days. For instance to keep &amp; show the last 5 days:

              # goaccess access.log --keep-last=5

   <b>VIRTUAL</b> <b>HOSTS</b>
       Assuming your log contains the virtual host (server blocks) field. For instance:

              vhost.com:80 10.131.40.139 - - [02/Mar/2016:08:14:04 -0600] "GET /shop/bag-p-20 HTTP/1.1" 200 6715
              "-" "Apache (internal dummy connection)"

       And  you  would like to append the virtual host to the request in order to see which virtual host the top
       urls belong to

              awk '$8=$1$8' access.log | goaccess -a -

       To exclude a list of virtual hosts you can do the following:

              # grep -v "`cat exclude_vhost_list_file`" vhost_access.log | goaccess -

   <b>FILES</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>STATUS</b> <b>CODES</b>
       To parse specific pages, e.g., page views, html, htm, php, etc. within a request:

              # awk '$7~/.html|.htm|.php/' access.log | goaccess -

       Note, <u>$7</u> is the request field for the common and combined log format, (without Virtual Host), if your log
       includes Virtual Host, then you probably want to use <u>$8</u> instead. It's best to check which field  you  are
       shooting for, e.g.:

              # tail -10 access.log | awk '{print $8}'

       Or to parse a specific status code, e.g., 500 (Internal Server Error):

              # awk '$9~/500/' access.log | goaccess -

   <b>SERVER</b>
       Also, it is worth pointing out that if we want to run GoAccess at lower priority, we can run it as:

              # nice -n 19 goaccess -f access.log -a

       and if you don't want to install it on your server, you can still run it from your local machine:

              # ssh -n root@server 'tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log' | goaccess -

       Note: SSH requires <u>-n</u> so GoAccess can read from stdin. Also, make sure to use SSH keys for authentication
       as it won't work if a passphrase is required.

   <b>INCREMENTAL</b> <b>LOG</b> <b>PROCESSING</b>
       GoAccess  has the ability to process logs incrementally through its internal storage and dump its data to
       disk. It works in the following way:

       1  A dataset must be persisted first with <u>--persist,</u> then the same dataset can be loaded with

       2  <u>--restore.</u>  If new data is passed (piped or through a log file), it will append  it  to  the  original
          dataset.

       NOTES

       GoAccess  keeps  track  of  inodes  of  all  the  files  processed  (assuming files will stay on the same
       partition), in addition, it extracts a snippet of data from the log along with the last  line  parsed  of
       each file and the timestamp of the last line parsed. e.g., inode:29627417|line:20012|ts:20171231235059

       First  it  compares  if  the  snippet matches the log being parsed, if it does, it assumes the log hasn't
       changed dramatically, e.g., hasn't been truncated. If the inode does  not  match  the  current  file,  it
       parses  all  lines.  If the current file matches the inode, it then reads the remaining lines and updates
       the count of lines parsed and the timestamp. As an extra precaution, it won't  parse  log  lines  with  a
       timestamp ≤ than the one stored.

       Piped  data  works based off the timestamp of the last line read. For instance, it will parse and discard
       all incoming entries until it finds a timestamp &gt;= than the one stored.

       For instance:

              // last month access log
              # goaccess access.log.1 --persist

       then, load it with

              // append this month access log, and preserve new data
              # goaccess access.log --restore --persist

       To read persisted data only (without parsing new data)

              # goaccess --restore

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Each active panel has a total of 366 items or 50 in the real-time HTML report.  The number  of  items  is
       customizable  using <u>max-items</u> Note that HTML, CSV and JSON output allow a maximum number greater than the
       default value of 366 items per panel.

       A hit is a request (line in the access log), e.g., 10 requests = 10 hits. HTTP requests with the same IP,
       date, and user agent are considered a unique visit.

       If you want to enable dual-stack support, please use <u>--addr=::</u> instead of the default <u>--addr=0.0.0.0.</u>

       The generated report will attempt to reconnect to the WebSocket server after 1  second  with  exponential
       backoff. It will attempt to connect 20 times.
