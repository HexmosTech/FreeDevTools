</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sitecopy - maintain remote copies of web sites

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sitecopy</b> <b>[options]</b> <b>[operation</b> <b>mode]</b> <u>sitename</u> <b>...</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>sitecopy</u>  is  for  copying  locally stored web sites to remote web servers.  A single command will upload
       files to the server which have changed locally, and delete files from the server which have been  removed
       locally,  to  keep  the remote site synchronized with the local site.  The aim is to remove the hassle of
       uploading and deleting individual files using an FTP client.  sitecopy will also optionally try  to  spot
       files you move locally, and move them remotely.

       FTP,  SFTP,  WebDAV  and  other  HTTP-based  authoring  servers  (for  instance,  AOLserver  and Netscape
       Enterprise) are supported.

</pre><h4><b>GETTING</b> <b>STARTED</b></h4><pre>
       This section covers how to start maintaining a web site using sitecopy.  After  introducing  the  basics,
       two  situations  are covered: first, where you have already upload the site to the remote server; second,
       where you haven't.  Lastly, normal site maintenance activities are explained.

   <b>Introducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Basics</b>
       If you have not already done so, you need to create an rcfile, which will  store  information  about  the
       sites  you wish to administer. You also need to create a storage directory, which sitecopy uses to record
       the state of the files on each of the remote sites.  The  rcfile  and  storage  directory  must  both  be
       accessible  only  by  you  -  sitecopy  will not run otherwise.  To create the storage directory with the
       correct permissions, use the command
            <b>mkdir</b> <b>-m</b> <b>700</b> <b>.sitecopy</b>
       from your home directory. To create the rcfile, use the commands
            <b>touch</b> <b>.sitecopyrc</b>
            <b>chmod</b> <b>600</b> <b>.sitecopyrc</b>
       from your home directory. Once this is done, edit the rcfile to enter your site details as shown  in  the
       CONFIGURATION section.

   <b>Existing</b> <b>Remote</b> <b>Site</b>
       If you have already uploaded the site to the remote server, ensure your local files are synchronized with
       the remote files. Then, run
            <b>sitecopy</b> <b>--catchup</b> <b>sitename</b>
       where sitename is the name of the site you used after the <b>site</b> keyword in the rcfile.

       If  you  do  not have a local copy of the remote site, then you can use <b>fetch</b> <b>mode</b> to discover what is on
       the remote site, and <b>synchronize</b> <b>mode</b> to download it. Fetch mode works well for WebDAV servers, and might
       work if you're lucky for FTP servers. Run
            <b>sitecopy</b> <b>--fetch</b> <b>sitename</b>
       to fetch the site - if this succeeds, then run
            <b>sitecopy</b> <b>--synch</b> <b>sitename</b>
       to download a local copy.  Do NOT do this if you already have a local copy of your site.

   <b>New</b> <b>Remote</b> <b>Site</b>
       Ensure that the root directory of the site has been created on the server by  the  server  administrator.
       Run
            <b>sitecopy</b> <b>--init</b> <b>sitename</b>
       where sitename is the name of the site you used after the <b>site</b> keyword in the rcfile.

   <b>Site</b> <b>Maintenance</b>
       After setting up the site as given in one of the two above sections, you can now start editing your local
       files  as  normal. When you have finished a set of changes, and you want to update the remote copy of the
       site, run:
            <b>sitecopy</b> <b>--update</b> <b>sitename</b>
       and all the changed files will be uploaded to the server. Any files you delete locally  will  be  deleted
       remotely  too,  unless  the  <b>nodelete</b>  option  is  specified in the rcfile. If you move any files between
       directories, the remote files will be deleted from the server then uploaded again unless you specify  the
       <b>checkmoved</b> option in the rcfile.

       At  any  time, if you wish to see what changes you have made to the local site since the last update, you
       can run
            <b>sitecopy</b> <b>sitename</b>
       which will display the list of differences.

   <b>Synchronization</b> <b>Problems</b>
       In some circumstances, the actual files which make up  the  remote  site  will  be  different  from  what
       sitecopy  <u>thinks</u> is on the remote site. This can happen, for instance, if the connection to the server is
       broken during an update. When this situation arises, <b>Fetch</b> <b>Mode</b> should be used to fetch the list of files
       making up the site from the remote server.

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b></h4><pre>
       In normal operation, specify a <u>single</u> operation mode, followed by any options you  choose,  then  one  or
       more site names. For instance,
            <b>sitecopy</b> <b>--update</b> <b>--quiet</b> <b>mainsite</b> <b>anothersite</b>
       will quietly update the sites named 'mainsite' and 'anothersite'.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATION</b> <b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       -l, --list
              <b>List</b>  <b>Mode</b> - produces a listing of all the differences between the local files and the remote copy
              for the specified sites.

       -ll, --flatlist
              <b>Flat</b> <b>list</b> <b>Mode</b> - like list mode, except the output produced is suitable for parsing by an external
              script or program. An AWK script, <b>changes.awk.</b>  is provided which produces an HTML page from  this
              mode.

       -u, --update
              <b>Update</b> <b>Mode</b> - updates the remote copy of the specified sites.

       -f, --fetch
              <b>Fetch</b>  <b>Mode</b>  -  fetches  the  list  of files from the remote server.  Note that this mode has only
              limited support in FTP - the server must accept the <b>MDTM</b> command, and use a  Unix-style  'ls'  for
              LIST implementation.

       -s, --synchronize
              <b>Synchronize</b>  <b>Mode</b>  -  updates  the <u>local</u> site from the remote copy.  <b>WARNING:</b> This mode overwrites
              local files. Use with care.

       -i, --initialize
              <b>Initialization</b> <b>Mode</b> - initializes the sites specified - making sitecopy think there are  NO  files
              on the remote server.

       -c, --catchup
              <b>Catchup</b> <b>Mode</b> - makes sitecopy think the local site is exactly the same as the remote copy.

       -v, --view
              <b>View</b> <b>Mode</b> - displays all the site definitions from the rcfile.

       -e, --verify
               Verify stored state of site matches real remote state

       -h, --help
              Display help information.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -y, --prompting

       -g, --logfile=FILE
               Append debugging messages to FILE (else use stderr)

       -x, --create-remote
               Create root for remote site

       -n, --dry-run
               Display  but  do not carry out the operation Applicable in <b>Update</b> <b>Mode</b> only, will prompt the user
              for confirmation for each update (i.e., creating a directory, uploading a file etc.).

       -r RCFILE, --rcfile=RCFILE
              Specify an alternate run control file location.

       -p PATH, --storepath=PATH
              Specify an alternate location to use for the remote site storage directory.

       -q, --quiet
              Quiet output - display the filename only for each update performed.

       -qq, --silent
              Very quiet output - display nothing for each update performed.

       -o, --show-progress
              Applicable in <b>Update</b> <b>Mode</b> only, displays the progress (percentage complete) of data transfer.

       -k, --keep-going
              Keep going past errors in <b>Update</b> <b>Mode</b> or <b>Synch</b> <b>Mode</b>

       -a, --allsites
              Perform the given operation on all sites - applicable for all modes except <b>View</b> <b>Mode,</b> for which it
              has no effect.

       -d MASK, --debug=KEY[,KEY...]
              Turns on debugging.  A list of comma-separated keywords should be given. Each keyword may  be  one
              of:
                socket    Socket handling
                files     File handling
                rcfile    rcfile parser
                http      HTTP driver
                httpbody  Display response bodies in HTTP
                ftp       FTP driver
                sftp      SFTP driver
                xml       XML parsing information
                xmlparse  Low-level XML parsing information
                httpauth  HTTP authentication information
                cleartext Display passwords in plain text

              Passwords  will  be  obscured in the debug output unless the cleartext keyword is used. An example
              use of debugging is to debug FTP fetch mode:

                   <b>sitecopy</b> <b>--debug=ftp,socket</b> <b>--fetch</b> <b>sitename</b>

</pre><h4><b>CONCEPTS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>stored</b> <b>state</b> of a site is the snapshot of the state of the site  saved  into  the  storage  directory
       (<a href="file:~/.sitecopy/">~/.sitecopy/</a>).  The  <b>storage</b>  <b>file</b>  is  used  to  record this state between invocations. In update mode,
       sitecopy builds up a <b>files</b> <b>list</b> for each site by scanning the local  directory,  reading  in  the  stored
       state, and comparing the two - determining which files have changed, which have moved, and so on.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration  is  performed  via  the  run  control  file  (rcfile).   This  file contains a set of site
       definitions.  A unique name is assigned to every site definition, which is used on the  command  line  to
       refer to the site.

       Each  site  definition  contains  the  details  of  the server the site is stored on, how the site may be
       accessed at that server, where the site is held locally and remotely, and any other options for the site.

   <b>Site</b> <b>Definition</b>
       A site definition is made up of a series of lines:

       <b>site</b> sitename
          <b>server</b> server-name
          <b>remote</b> remote-root-directory
          <b>local</b> local-root-directory
        [ <b>port</b> port-number ]
        [ <b>username</b> username ]
        [ <b>password</b> password ]
        [ <b>proxy-server</b> proxy-name
          <b>proxy-port</b> port-number ]
        [ <b>url</b> siteURL ]
        [ <b>protocol</b> { ftp | sftp | webdav } ]
        [ <b>ftp</b> nopasv ]
        [ <b>ftp</b> showquit ]
        [ <b>ftp</b> { usecwd | nousecwd } ]
        [ <b>http</b> expect ]
        [ <b>http</b> secure ]
        [ <b>safe</b> ]
        [ <b>state</b> { checksum | timesize } ]
        [ <b>permissions</b> { ignore | exec | all | dir } ]
        [ <b>symlinks</b> { ignore | follow | maintain } ]
        [ <b>nodelete</b> ]
        [ <b>nooverwrite</b> ]
        [ <b>checkmoved</b> [renames] ]
        [ <b>tempupload</b> ]
        [ <b>exclude</b> pattern ]...
        [ <b>ignore</b> pattern ]...
        [ <b>ascii</b> pattern ]...

       Anything after a hash (#) in a line is ignored as a comment.  Values may be quoted and characters may  be
       backslash-escaped.  For example, to use the <b>exclude</b> pattern *#, use the following line:
            <b>exclude</b> "*#"

   <b>Remote</b> <b>Server</b> <b>Options</b>
       The <b>server</b> key is used to specify the remote server the site is stored on.  This may be either a DNS name
       or  IP address. A connection is made to the default port for the protocol used, or that given by the <b>port</b>
       key.  sitecopy supports the WebDAV or (S)FTP protocols - the <b>protocol</b> key specifies which to use,  taking
       the value of either <b>webdav</b> or <b>ftp/sftp</b> respectively. By default, FTP will be used.

       The  <b>proxy-server</b>  and  <b>proxy-port</b>  keys  may be used to specify a proxy server to use. Proxy servers are
       currently only supported for WebDAV.

       If the FTP server does not support passive (PASV) mode, then the key  <b>ftp</b>  <b>nopasv</b>  should  be  used.   To
       display  the  message  returned by the server on closing the connection, use the <b>ftp</b> <b>showquit</b> option.  If
       the server only supports uploading files in the  current  working  directory,  use  the  key  <b>ftp</b>  <b>usecwd</b>
       (possible  symptom: "overwrite permission denied").  Note that the remote-directory (keyword <b>remote</b>) must
       be an absolute path (starting with '/'), or <b>usecwd</b> will be ignored.

       If the WebDAV server correctly supports the 100-continue expectation, e.g. Apache 1.3.9  and  later,  the
       key <b>http</b> <b>expect</b> should be used. Doing so can save some bandwidth and time in an update.

       If  the  WebDAV server supports access via SSL, the key <b>http</b> <b>secure</b> can be used.  Doing so will cause the
       transfers between sitecopy and the host to be performed using an secure, encrypted link.  The first  time
       SSL  is  used  to access the server, the user will be prompted to verify the SSL certificate, if it's not
       signed by a CA trusted in the system's CA root bundle.

       To authenticate the user with the server, the <b>username</b> and <b>password</b> keys are  used.  If  it  exists,  the
       <b><a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a></b> will be searched for a password if one is not specified. See <a href="../man1/ftp.1.html">ftp</a>(1) for the syntax of this file.

       Basic and digest authentication are supported for WebDAV. Note that basic authentication must not be used
       unless the connection is known to be secure.

       The  full  URL  that  is used to access the site can optionally be specified in the <b>url</b> key. This is used
       only in flat list mode, so the site URL can be inserted in 'Recent Changes' pages. The URL must <u>not</u>  have
       a trailing slash; a valid example is
            <b>url</b> <a href="http://www.site.com/mysite">http://www.site.com/mysite</a>

       If  the  <b>tempupload</b>  option is given, new or changed files are upload with a ".in." prefix, then moved to
       the true filename when the upload is complete.

   <b>File</b> <b>State</b>
       File state is stored in the storage files (<a href="file:~/.sitecopy/">~/.sitecopy/</a>*), and is used to discover when a file  has  been
       changed.   Two  methods are supported, and can be selected using the <b>state</b> option, with either parameter:
       <b>timesize</b> (the default), and <b>checksum.</b>

       <b>timesize</b> uses the last-modification date and the  size  of  files  to  detect  when  they  have  changed.
       <b>checksum</b> uses an MD5 checksum to detect any changes to the file contents.

       Note that MD5 checksumming involves reading in the entire file, and is slower than simply using the last-
       modification  date and size. It may be useful for instance if a versioning system is in use which updates
       the last-modification date on a 'checkout', but this doesn't actually change the file contents.

   <b>Safe</b> <b>Mode</b>
       <b>Safe</b> <b>Mode</b> is enabled by using the <b>safe</b> key. When enabled, each time a file is uploaded to the server, the
       modification time of the file <b>as</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>server</b> is recorded. Subsequently, whenever  this  file  has  been
       changed  locally  and is to be uploaded again, the current modification time of the file on the server is
       retrieved, and compared with the stored value. If these differ, then the remote copy of the file has been
       altered by a foreign party.  A warning message is issued, and your local copy of the  file  will  not  be
       uploaded over it, to prevent losing any changes.

       Safe  Mode can be used with FTP or WebDAV servers, but if Apache/mod_dav is used, mod_dav 0.9.11 or later
       is required.

       <b>Note</b> Safe mode cannot be used in conjunction with the <b>nooverwrite</b> option (see below).

   <b>File</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>Locations</b>
       The <b>remote</b> key specifies the root directory of the remote copy of the site.  It may be in the form of  an
       absolute pathname, e.g.
            <b>remote</b> /www/mysite/
       For  FTP,  the  directory may also be specified relative to the login directory, in which case it must be
       prefixed by "~/", for example:
            <b>remote</b> <a href="file:~/public_html/">~/public_html/</a>

       The <b>local</b> key specifies the directory in which the site is stored locally.  This may be given relative to
       your home directory (as given by the environment variable $HOME), again using the "~/" prefix.
            <b>local</b> <a href="file:~/html/foosite/">~/html/foosite/</a>
            <b>local</b> /home/fred/html/foosite/
       are equivalent, if $HOME is set to "/home/fred".

       For both the local and remote keywords, a trailing slash may be used, but is not required.

   <b>File</b> <b>Permissions</b> <b>Handling</b>
       File permissions handling is dictated by the <b>permissions</b> key, which may be given one of three values:

       <b>ignore</b> to ignore file permissions completely (the default),

       <b>exec</b>   to mirror the permissions of executable files only,

       <b>all</b>    to mirror the permissions of all files.

       This can be used, for instance, to ensure the permissions of CGI files are set. The option  is  currently
       ignored for WebDAV servers. For FTP servers, a <b>chmod</b> is performed remotely to set the permissions.

       To handle directory permissions, the key:
          <b>permissions</b> <b>dir</b>
       may  be  used  in  addition to a <b>permissions</b> key of either <b>exec,</b> <b>local</b> or <b>all.</b>  Note that <b>permissions</b> <b>all</b>
       does not imply <b>permissions</b> <b>dir.</b>

   <b>Symbolic</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Handling</b>
       Symlinks found in the local site can be either ignored, followed, or maintained. In  'follow'  mode,  the
       files  references  by  the symlinks will be uploaded in their place. In 'maintain' mode, the link will be
       created remotely as well, see below for more information. The mode used for each site is  specified  with
       the  <b>symlinks</b>  rcfile  key,  which may take the value of <b>ignore,</b> <b>follow</b> or <b>maintain</b> to select the mode as
       appropriate.

       The default mode is <b>follow,</b> i.e. symbolic links found in the local site are followed.

   <b>Symbolic</b> <b>link</b> <b>Maintain</b> <b>Mode</b>
       This mode is currently only supported by the WebDAV  driver,  and  will  work  only  with  servers  which
       implement  WebDAV Advanced Collections, which is a work-in-progress. The target of the link on the server
       is literally copied from the target of the symlink. Hint: you can use URL's if you like:
            <b>ln</b> <b>-s</b> <b>"<a href="http://www.somewhere.org/">http://www.somewhere.org/</a>"</b> <b>somewherehome</b>

       In this way, a "302 Redirect" can be easily set up from the client, without having to  alter  the  server
       configuration.

   <b>Deleting</b> <b>and</b> <b>Moving</b> <b>Remote</b> <b>Files</b>
       The  <b>nodelete</b>  option  may be used to prevent remote files from ever being deleted. This may be useful if
       you keep large amounts of data on the remote server which you do not need to store locally as well.

       If your server does not allow you to upload changed files over existing  files,  then  you  can  use  the
       <b>nooverwrite</b> option. When this is used, before uploading a changed file, the remote file will be deleted.

       If  the <b>checkmoved</b> option is used, sitecopy will look for any files which have been moved locally. If any
       are found, when the remote site is updated, the files will be moved remotely.

       If the <b>checkmoved</b> <b>renames</b> option is used, sitecopy will look for any  files  which  have  been  moved  or
       renamed locally. This option may only be used in conjunction with the <b>state</b> <b>checksum</b> option.

       <b>WARNING</b>

       If  you  are  not using MD5 checksumming (i.e. the <b>state</b> <b>checksum</b> option) to determine file state, do NOT
       use the <b>checkmoved</b> option if you tend to hold  files  in  different  directories  with  identical  sizes,
       modification  times  and  names  and ever move them about. This seems unlikely, but don't say you haven't
       been warned.

   <b>Excluding</b> <b>Files</b>
       Files may be excluded from the files list by use of the <b>exclude</b> key, which accepts  shell-style  globbing
       patterns. For example, use
            <b>exclude</b> *.bak
            <b>exclude</b> *~
            <b>exclude</b> "#*#"
       to  exclude  all  files which have a .bak extension, end in a tilde (~) character, or which begin and end
       with a a hash. Don't forget to quote or escape the value if it includes a hash!

       To exclude certain files within an particular directory, simply prefix the  pattern  with  the  directory
       name - including a leading slash. For instance:
            <b>exclude</b> /docs/*.m4
            <b>exclude</b> /files/*.gz
       which will exclude all files with the .m4 extension in the 'docs' subdirectory of the site, and all files
       with the .gz extension in the files subdirectory.

       An  entire  directory  can  also  be excluded - simply use the directory name with no trailing slash. For
       example
            <b>exclude</b> /foo/bar
            <b>exclude</b> /where/else
       to exclude the 'foo/bar' and 'where/else' subdirectories of the site.

       Exclude patterns are consulted when scanning the local directory,  and  when  scanning  the  remote  site
       during a --fetch.  Any file which matches any exclude pattern is not added to the files list.  This means
       that a file which has already been uploaded by sitecopy, and subsequently matches an exclude pattern will
       be deleted from the server.

   <b>Ignoring</b> <b>Local</b> <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Files</b>
       The <b>ignore</b> option is used to instruct sitecopy to ignore any local changes made to a file. If a change is
       made  to  the  contents  of an ignored file, this file will <b>not</b> be uploaded by update mode. Ignored files
       will be created, moved and deleted as normal.

       The <b>ignore</b> option is used in the same way as the <b>exclude</b> option.

       Note that synchronize mode <b>will</b> overwrite changes made to ignored files.

   <b>FTP</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Mode</b>
       To specify the FTP transfer mode for files, use the <b>ascii</b> key. Any  files  which  are  transferred  using
       ASCII mode have CRLF/LF translation performed appropriately. For example, use
            <b>ascii</b> *.pl
       to  upload  all  files  with  the  .pl  extension  as  ASCII  text.   This  key has no effect with WebDAV
       (currently).

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       Return values are specified for different operation modes. If multiple sites are specified on the command
       line, the return value is in respect to the last site given.

   <b>Update</b> <b>Mode</b>
        -1 ... update never even started - configuration problem
         0 ... update was entirely successful.
         1 ... update went wrong somewhere
         2 ... could not connect or login to server

   <b>List</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>(default</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation)</b>
        -1 ... could not form list - configuration problem
         0 ... the remote site does not need updating
         1 ... the remote site needs updating

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b> <b>RCFILE</b> <b>CONTENTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>FTP</b> <b>Server,</b> <b>Simple</b> <b>Usage</b>
       Fred's site is uploaded to the FTP server 'my.server.com' and held in the directory 'public_html',  which
       is in the login directory. The site is stored locally in the directory /home/fred/html.

       site mysite
         server my.server.com
         url <a href="http://www.server.com/fred">http://www.server.com/fred</a>
         username fred
         password juniper
         local /home/fred/html/
         remote <a href="file:~/public_html/">~/public_html/</a>

   <b>FTP</b> <b>Server,</b> <b>Complex</b> <b>Usage</b>
       Here,  Freda's  site is uploaded to the FTP server ´ftp.elsewhere.com´, where it is held in the directory
       /www/freda/. The local site is stored in /home/freda/sites/elsewhere/

       site anothersite
         server ftp.elsewhere.com
         username freda
         password blahblahblah
         local /home/freda/sites/elsewhere/
         remote /www/freda/
         # Freda wants files with a .bak extension or a
         # trailing ~ to be ignored:
         exclude *.bak
         exclude *~

   <b>WebDAV</b> <b>Server,</b> <b>Simple</b> <b>Usage</b>
       This example shows use of a WebDAV server.

       site supersite
         server dav.wow.com
         protocol webdav
         username pow
         password zap
         local /home/joe/www/super/
         remote /

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.sitecopyrc">~/.sitecopyrc</a></u> Default run control file location.

       <u><a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a></u> Remote server accounts information

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Known problems: Fetch + synch modes are NOT reliable for FTP.  If you need reliable operation of fetch or
       synch modes, you shouldn't be using sitecopy.  Try rsync instead.

       Please send bug reports and feature requests to &lt;<a href="mailto:sitecopy@lyra.org">sitecopy@lyra.org</a>&gt; rather than to the author, since  the
       mailing list is archived and can be a useful resource for others.
