       THESIAS - Testing Haplotype Effects In Association Studies

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  objectif  of  the  THESIAS program is to performed haplotype-based association analysis in unrelated
       individuals. This program is based on the maximum likelihood model described in Tregouet et al. 2002 (Hum
       Mol Genet 2002,11: 2015-2023) and is linked to the SEM algorithm (Tregouet et al. Ann Hum Genet  2004,68:
       165-177).   THESIAS allows one to simultaneous estimate haplotype frequencies and their associate effects
       on the phenotype of interest.  In this new  THESIAS  release,  quantitative,  qualitative  (logistic  and
       matched-pair  analysis), categorical and survival outcomes can be studied. X-linked haplotype analysis is
       also feasible.  Covariate-adjusted haplotype effects as well as haplotype x  covariate  interactions  can
       also be investigated.

       THESIAS was written by David-Alexandre Trégouët.
