</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       weston - the reference Wayland server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>weston</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>weston</b>  is  the  reference  implementation  of  a Wayland server. A Wayland server is a display server, a
       window manager, and a compositor all in one. Weston has several backends as loadable modules: it can  run
       on Linux KMS (kernel modesetting via DRM), as an X client, or inside another Wayland server instance.

       Weston supports fundamentally different graphical user interface paradigms via shell plugins. Two plugins
       are provided: the desktop shell, and the kiosk shell.

       Weston also supports X clients via <b>Xwayland</b>, see below.

</pre><h4><b>BACKENDS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>drm</u>    The  DRM  backend  uses  Linux  KMS  for output and evdev devices for input.  It supports multiple
              monitors in a unified desktop with DPMS. See <b><a href="../man7/weston-drm.7.html">weston-drm</a></b>(7), if installed.

       <u>wayland</u>
              The Wayland backend runs on another Wayland server, a  different  Weston  instance,  for  example.
              Weston shows up as a single desktop window on the parent server.

       <u>x11</u>    The  X11  backend runs on an X server. Each Weston output becomes an X window. This is a cheap way
              to test multi-monitor support of a Wayland shell, desktop, or applications.

       <u>rdp</u>    The RDP backend runs in memory without the need of graphical hardware. Access to  the  desktop  is
              done  by  using the RDP protocol. Each connecting client has its own seat making it a cheap way to
              test multi-seat support. See <b><a href="../man7/weston-rdp.7.html">weston-rdp</a></b>(7), if installed.

       <u>vnc</u>    The VNC backend runs in memory without the need of graphical hardware. Access to  the  desktop  is
              done  by  using  the  RFB protocol. Currently only one connecting client is supported. See <b><a href="../man7/westonvnc.7.html">weston-</a></b>
              <b><a href="../man7/westonvnc.7.html">vnc</a></b>(7), if installed.

       <u>pipewire</u>
              The PipeWire backend runs in memory without the need of graphical hardware and creates a  PipeWire
              node  for  each  output.  It  can  be  used  to capture Weston outputs for processing with another
              application.

       <u>headless</u>
              The headless backend runs in memory. It can be used to capture Weston outputs or  to  test  client
              applications.

</pre><h4><b>SHELLS</b></h4><pre>
       Weston's  user  interface  is implemented by individual 'shell' plugins.  A number of shells are provided
       for different usecases.

       <u>desktop</u>
              The desktop shell is Weston's default mode. It provides an example of a desktop-like  environment,
              featuring  a  panel  with  launchers  and a clock, a background, and an interactive task switcher.
              Whilst not intended to be a full-fledged desktop environment in and of itself, it is an example of
              how such an environment can be built.

       <u>kiosk</u>  The kiosk shell is intended for environments which want to run a single  application  at  a  time.
              Applications will be made full screen and activated as they are started.

       <u>fullscreen</u>
              The  fullscreen  shell  is  a  deprecated  implementation  of the ideas behind the kiosk shell. It
              requires specific client support for the <u>zwp_fullscreen_shell_v1</u> interface.

       <u>ivi</u>    The IVI shell is a special-purpose shell which exposes an API compatible  with  the  GENIVI  Layer
              Manager  to  user-provided  HMI  controller  modules.   It  is  intended  for  use  in  automotive
              environments.

</pre><h4><b>XWAYLAND</b></h4><pre>
       Weston can support X11 clients running within a Weston session via an X server called <b>Xwayland</b>.  Xwayland
       is built as a separate executable, provided by X.Org. Once built and installed, it can be activated  with
       the  <b>--xwayland</b>  option. Weston will listen on a new X11 display socket and export it through the <b>DISPLAY</b>
       environment variable.

       It has also its own X window manager where cursor themes and sizes can be chosen using  <b>XCURSOR_PATH</b>  and
       <b>XCURSOR_SIZE</b> environment variables. See <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Weston</b> <b>core</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-B</b><u>backend1,backend2</u>, <b>--backend</b>=<u>backend1,backend2</u>
              Load  the  comma-separated  list  of  backends  instead of the default backend, see <u>BACKENDS</u>.  The
              backend modules are searched for in <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/weston</u>.  The default backend is  <u>drm</u>
              unless  the environment suggests otherwise, see <u>DISPLAY</u> and <u>WAYLAND_DISPLAY</u>.  The first backend is
              the primary backend, and it provides the renderer.  Not  all  backends  support  being  loaded  as
              secondary backends, which reuse the primary backend's renderer.

       <b>-c</b><u>config.ini</u>, <b>--config</b>=<u>config.ini</u>
              Load  <u>config.ini</u> instead of <u>weston.ini</u>.  The argument can also be an absolute path starting with a
              <u>/</u>.  If the  path  is  not  absolute,  it  will  be  searched  in  the  normal  config  paths,  see
              <b><a href="../man5/weston.ini.5.html">weston.ini</a></b>(5).  This option is ignored if the <b>--no-config</b> option is passed.

       <b>--debug</b>
              Enable  debug  protocol  extension  <u>weston_debug_v1</u>  which any client can use to receive debugging
              messages from the compositor.

              <b>WARNING:</b> This is risky for two reasons. First, a client may cause a denial-of-service blocking the
              compositor by providing an unsuitable file descriptor, and second, the debug messages  may  expose
              sensitive  information.  Additionally this will expose weston-screenshooter interface allowing the
              user to take screenshots of the outputs using weston-screenshooter application, which can lead  to
              silently leaking the output contents.  This option should not be used in production.

       <b>-f</b><u>scope1,scope2</u>, <b>--flight-rec-scopes</b>=<u>scope1,scope2</u>
              Specify  to  which  scopes should subscribe to. Useful to control which streams to write data into
              the flight recorder. Flight recorder has limited space, once the flight recorder is full new  data
              will  overwrite  the  old  data.  Without  any  scopes specified, it subscribes to 'log' and 'drm-
              backend' scopes. Passing an empty value would disable the flight recorder entirely.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print a summary of command line options, and quit.

       <b>-i</b><u>N</u>, <b>--idle-time</b>=<u>N</u>
              Set the idle timeout to <u>N</u> seconds. The default timeout is 300 seconds. When there has not been any
              user input for the idle timeout, Weston enters an  inactive  mode.  The  screen  fades  to  black,
              monitors  may  switch  off, and the shell may lock the session.  A value of 0 effectively disables
              the timeout.

       <b>--log</b>=<u>file.log</u>
              Append log messages to the file <u>file.log</u> instead of writing them to stderr.

       <b>-l</b><u>scope1,scope2</u>, <b>--logger-scopes</b>=<u>scope1,scope2</u>
              Specify to which log scopes should subscribe to. When no scopes are supplied, the log "log"  scope
              will  be  subscribed by default. Useful to control which streams to write data into the logger and
              can be helpful in diagnosing early start-up code.

       <b>--modules</b>=<u>module1.so,module2.so</u>
              Load the comma-separated list of modules. Only used by the test suite. The file is searched for in
              <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/weston</u>, or you can pass an absolute path.

       <b>--no-config</b>
              Do not read <u>weston.ini</u> for  the  compositor.  Avoids  e.g.  loading  compositor  modules  via  the
              configuration file, which is useful for unit tests.

       <b>--renderer</b>=<u>renderer</u>
              Select which renderer to use for Weston's internal composition. Defaults to automatic selection.

       <b>--shell</b>=<u>shell</u>
              Select which shell to load to provide Weston's user interface. See <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>.

       <b>-S</b><u>name</u>, <b>--socket</b>=<u>name</u>
              Weston  will  listen  in  the Wayland socket called <u>name</u>.  Weston will export <b>WAYLAND_DISPLAY</b> with
              this value in the environment for all child processes to allow them to connect to the right server
              automatically.  <b>--version</b> Print the program version.

       <b>--wait-for-debugger</b>
              Raises SIGSTOP before initializing the compositor. This allows the user to attach with a  debugger
              and  continue  execution by sending SIGCONT. This is useful for debugging a crash on start-up when
              it would be inconvenient to launch weston directly from a debugger. There  is  also  a  <u>weston.ini</u>
              option to do the same.

       <b>--xwayland</b>
              Support X11 clients through the Xwayland server.

   <b>DRM</b> <b>backend</b> <b>options:</b>
       See <b><a href="../man7/weston-drm.7.html">weston-drm</a></b>(7).

   <b>Wayland</b> <b>backend</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>--display</b>=<u>display</u>
              Name of the Wayland display to connect to, see also <u>WAYLAND_DISPLAY</u> of the environment.

       <b>--fullscreen</b>
              Create a single fullscreen output

       <b>--output-count</b>=<u>N</u>
              Create <u>N</u> Wayland windows to emulate the same number of outputs.

       <b>--width</b>=<u>W</u>, <b>--height</b>=<u>H</u>
              Make all outputs have a size of <u>W</u>x<u>H</u> pixels.

       <b>--scale</b>=<u>N</u>
              Give all outputs a scale factor of <u>N.</u>

       <b>--use-pixman</b>
              Deprecated  in  favour of the <b>--renderer</b> option.  Use the pixman renderer.  By default weston will
              try to use EGL and GLES2 for rendering and  will  fall  back  to  the  pixman-based  renderer  for
              software  compositing  if  EGL  cannot  be used.  Passing this option will force weston to use the
              pixman renderer.

   <b>X11</b> <b>backend</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>--fullscreen</b>

       <b>--no-input</b>
              Do not provide any input devices. Used for testing input-less Weston.

       <b>--output-count</b>=<u>N</u>
              Create <u>N</u> X windows to emulate the same number of outputs.

       <b>--width</b>=<u>W</u>, <b>--height</b>=<u>H</u>
              Make the default size of each X window <u>W</u>x<u>H</u> pixels.

       <b>--scale</b>=<u>N</u>
              Give all outputs a scale factor of <u>N.</u>

       <b>--use-pixman</b>
              Deprecated in favour of the <b>--renderer</b> option.  Use the pixman renderer.  By default  weston  will
              try  to  use  EGL  and  GLES2  for rendering.  Passing this option will make weston use the pixman
              library for software compsiting.

   <b>RDP</b> <b>backend</b> <b>options:</b>
       See <b><a href="../man7/weston-rdp.7.html">weston-rdp</a></b>(7).

   <b>VNC</b> <b>backend</b> <b>options:</b>
       See <b><a href="../man7/weston-vnc.7.html">weston-vnc</a></b>(7).

   <b>headless</b> <b>backend</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>--width</b>=<u>W</u>, <b>--height</b>=<u>H</u>
              Make the default size of each output <u>W</u>x<u>H</u> pixels.

       <b>--scale</b>=<u>N</u>
              Give all outputs a scale factor of <u>N</u>.

       <b>--transform</b>=<u>transform</u>
              Transform for the output, which can be rotated in 90-degree steps and possibly  flipped.  Possible
              values  are  <b>normal</b>,  <b>rotate-90</b>,  <b>rotate-180</b>,  <b>rotate-270</b>,  <b>flipped</b>,  <b>flipped-rotate-90</b>,  <b>flipped-</b>
              <b>rotate-180</b>, and <b>flipped-rotate-270</b>.

       <b>--no-outputs</b>
              Do not create any virtual outputs.

       <b>--refresh-rate</b>=<u>N</u>
              Give all outputs a refresh rate of <u>N</u> mHz (60,000 mHz by default).  Supported values range  from  0
              mHz  to  1,000,000 mHz. 0 is a special value that repaints as soon as possible on capture requests
              only, not on damages.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       If the environment variable is set, the configuration file is read from the respective path.

       <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b><u>/weston.ini</u>
       <b>$HOME</b><u>/.config/weston.ini</u>

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b>
              The X display. If <b>DISPLAY</b> is set, and <b>WAYLAND_DISPLAY</b> is not set, the default backend becomes <u>x11</u>.

       <b>WAYLAND_DEBUG</b>
              If set to any value, causes libwayland to print the live protocol to stderr.

       <b>WAYLAND_DISPLAY</b>
              The name of the display (socket) of an already running  Wayland  server,  without  the  path.  The
              directory  path  is  always taken from <b>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</b>.  If <b>WAYLAND_DISPLAY</b> is not set, the socket
              name is "wayland-0".

              If <b>WAYLAND_DISPLAY</b> is already set, the default backend becomes  <u>wayland</u>.   This  allows  launching
              Weston as a nested server.

       <b>WAYLAND_SOCKET</b>
              For Wayland clients, holds the file descriptor of an open local socket to a Wayland server.

       <b>WESTON_CONFIG_FILE</b>
              Weston sets this variable to the absolute path of the configuration file it loads, or to the empty
              string  if  no  file  is  used.  Programs that use <u>weston.ini</u> will read the file specified by this
              variable instead, or do not read any file if it is empty. Unset variable causes  falling  back  to
              the default name <u>weston.ini</u>.

       <b>XCURSOR_PATH</b>
              Set the list of paths to look for cursors in. It changes both libwayland-cursor and libXcursor, so
              it affects both Wayland and X11 based clients. See <b>xcursor</b> (3).

       <b>XCURSOR_SIZE</b>
              This  variable can be set for choosing an specific size of cursor. Affect Wayland and X11 clients.
              See <b>xcursor</b> (3).

       <b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b>
              If set, specifies the directory where to look for <b>weston.ini</b>.

       <b>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</b>
              The directory for Weston's socket and lock files.  Wayland clients will automatically use this.

</pre><h4><b>PROGRAM</b> <b>EXECUTION</b></h4><pre>
       It is possible to execute a program that will be run by Weston.

       By using this syntax :
              weston [options] -- [program [arguments]]

       The '--' here is mandatory to execute a program. There are examples in the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
