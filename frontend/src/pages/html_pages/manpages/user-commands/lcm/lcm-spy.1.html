</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lcm-spy - traffic inspection tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lcm-spy</b> <u>[options]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lcm-spy</b>  is the Lightweight Communications and Marshalling traffic inspection utility.  It is a graphical
       tool for viewing messages received on an LCM network, and is analogous to tools  like  Ethereal/Wireshark
       and  tcpdump  in  that  it  is  able  to  inspect  all  LCM messages received and provide information and
       statistics on the channels used.

       When given appropriate LCM type definitions, <b>lcm-spy</b> is able to automatically detect and decode messages,
       and can display the  individual  fields  of  recognized  messages.   <b>lcm-spy</b>  is  limited  to  displaying
       statistics for unrecognized messages.

       <b>lcm-spy</b> collects the following statistics for each channel:

       - Channel name

       - Number of messages received

       - Message Rate (Hz)

       - Bandwidth (KB/s)

         On  its  own,  this  information can often be used to verify that messages are being transmitted on the
         expected channels, and at the expected data rates.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are provided by <b>lcm-spy</b>

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--lcm-url=</b><u>URL</u>
              Use the specified LCM URL

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--title</b> <b>[LABEL]</b>
              Display LABEL in the window title

       <b>--title-url</b>
              Display the LCM URL in the title

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Shows some help text and exits

</pre><h4><b>AUTOMATIC</b> <b>MESSAGE</b> <b>DECODING</b></h4><pre>
       If a Java class generated by <b>lcm-gen</b> for an LCM type definition is contained within a JAR file that is on
       the Java classpath, <b>lcm-spy</b> automatically detects the class  and  uses  Java  reflection  to  insert  the
       corresponding  LCM type definitions into a type database.  Subsequently, <b>lcm-spy</b> is able to automatically
       recognize and decode messages received that correspond to all such types.
