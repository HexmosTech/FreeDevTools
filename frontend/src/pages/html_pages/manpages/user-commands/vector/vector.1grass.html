       <b>Geographic</b>  <b>Resources</b>  <b>Analysis</b>  <b>Support</b>  <b>System</b>,  commonly  referred  to  as  GRASS GIS, is a Geographic
       Information  System  (GIS)  used  for  geospatial  data  management  and  analysis,   image   processing,
       graphics/maps  production,  spatial  modeling, and visualization. GRASS is currently used in academic and
       commercial settings around the world,  as  well  as  by  many  governmental  agencies  and  environmental
       consulting companies.

       This  reference  manual details the use of modules distributed with Geographic Resources Analysis Support
       System (GRASS), an open source (GNU GPLed), image processing and geographic information system (GIS).  Go
