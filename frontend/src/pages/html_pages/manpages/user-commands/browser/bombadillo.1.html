</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bombadillo</b> - a non-web browser

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bombadillo</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>url</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bombadillo</b>  is  a  non-web browser for the terminal. It features a full terminal user interface, vim-like
       keybindings, document pager, configurable settings, and a robust command selection.

       <b>bombadillo</b> supports the following protocols as first class citizens: gopher, gemini, finger, and local (a
       userâ€™s file system). Support for telnet, http and https is also available via integration with third
       party applications.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Display usage help and exit. Provides a list of all command line options with a short  description
              and exits.

       <b>-t</b>     Set  the window title to 'Bombadillo'. Can be used in a GUI environment, however not all terminals
              support this feature.

       <b>-v</b>     Display version information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>PROTOCOL</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       All of the below protocols are supported. With the exception of gopher, the protocol name must be present
       as the scheme component of a url in the form of <u>[protocol]://[the</u> <u>rest</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>url]</u>.

       <b>gopher</b> Gopher is the default protocol for <b>bombadillo</b>. Any textual item types will be visited and shown to
              the user and any non-text types will be downloaded. Type 7 (querying) is fully supported.  As  the
              default  protocol,  any  url  that is not prefixed with the scheme section of a url (<u>gopher://</u> for
              example) will be treated as gopher urls.

       <b>gemini</b> Gemini is supported, but as a new protocol with an incomplete specification, features  may  change
              over time. At present Bombadillo supports TLS with a trust on first use certificate pinning system
              (similar  to SSH). Gemini maps and other text types are rendered in the browser and non-text types
              will be downloaded.

       <b>finger</b> Basic    support    is    provided    for    the    finger    protocol.     The     format     is:
              <u>finger://[[username@]][hostname]</u>.  Many  servers  still support finger and it can be fun to see if
              friends are online or read about the users whose phlogs you follow.

       <b>local</b>  Local is similar to the <u>file</u> protocol used in web browsers or the like,  with  a  smaller  set  of
              features.  Users  can  use  the  local scheme to view files on their local system. Directories are
              supported as viewable text object as well as any files. Wildcards and globbing are not  supported.
              Using  <u>~</u> to represent a user's home directory, as well as relative paths, are supported. The <u>color</u>
              theme has no effect on this protocol and all terminal escape sequences will  be  rendered  to  the
              screen literally.

       <b>telnet</b> Telnet  is  not  supported  directly, but addresses will be followed and opened as a subprocess by
              whatever telnet client a user sets in their settings (defaulting to <u>telnet</u>). In  some  cases  this
              behavior may be buggy.

       <b>http,</b> <b>https</b>
              Neither  of  the  world wide web protocols are supported directly. <b>bombadillo</b> can be configured to
              open web links in a user's default graphical web browser. It  is  also  possible  to  display  web
              content  directly  in <b>bombadillo</b> using lynx, w3m, or elinks terminal web browsers to render pages.
              Opening http/https links is opt-in only, controlled by the <u>webmode</u> setting.

              Opening links in a default graphical web browser will only work in a GUI environment.

              Displaying web content directly in <b>bombadillo</b> requires lynx, w3m or elinks terminal  web  browsers
              are installed on the system.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>KEY</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These commands work as a single keypress anytime <b>bombadillo</b> is not taking in a line based command or when
       the user is being prompted for action. This is the default command mode of <b>bombadillo</b>.

       <b>b,</b> <b>h</b>   Navigate back one place in your document history.

       <b>B</b>      Toggle the bookmarks panel open/closed.

       <b>d</b>      Scroll down an amount corresponding to 75% of your terminal window height in the current document.

       <b>f,</b> <b>l</b>   Navigate forward one place in your document history.

       <b>g</b>      Scroll to the top of the current document.

       <b>G</b>      Scroll to the bottom of the current document.

       <b>j</b>      Scroll down a single line in the current document.

       <b>k</b>      Scroll up a single line.

       <b>n</b>      Jump to next found text item.

       <b>q</b>      Quit <b>bombadillo</b>.

       <b>R</b>      Reload the current page (does not destroy forward history).

       <b>1,</b> <b>2,</b> <b>3,</b> <b>4,</b> <b>5,</b> <b>6,</b> <b>7,</b> <b>8,</b> <b>9,</b> <b>0</b>
              Quick  navigation  to  the  first 10 links on a page. The 0 key will navigate to the link numbered
              '10', all other numbers navigate to their matching link number.

       <b>U</b>      Move up a level in the current url path. <u>/mydir/mysubdir/myfile.txt</u> would become <u>/mydir/mysubdir/</u>,
              and so on.

       <b>u</b>      Scroll up an amount corresponding to 75% of your terminal window height in the current document.

       <b>/</b>      Search for text within current document. / followed by a  text  query  will  highlight  and  allow
              navigation of found text. / with an empty query will clear the current query.

   <b>LINE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These  commands  are  typed  in by the user to perform an action of some sort. As listed in KEY COMMANDS,
       this mode is initiated by pressing : or &lt;space&gt;. The command names themselves  are  not  case  sensitive,
       though the arguments supplied to them may be.

              file saves to the directory set by the <u>savelocation</u> setting. <u>w</u> can be entered rather than the full
              <u>write</u>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bombadillo</b>  keeps  a  hidden  configuration  file  in a user's XDG configuration directory. The file is a
       simplified ini file titled <u>.bombadillo.ini</u>. It is generated when a user first  loads  <b>bombadillo</b>  and  is
       updated  with bookmarks and settings as a user adds them. The file can be directly edited, but it is best
       to use the SET command to update settings whenever possible. To return to the state of a  fresh  install,
       simply  remove  the file and a new one will be generated with the <b>bombadillo</b> defaults. On some systems an
       administrator may set the configuration file location to somewhere other than the default setting. If you
       do not see the file  where  you  expect  it,  or  if  your  settings  are  not  being  read,  try  <u>:check</u>
       <u>configlocation</u>  to  see  where  the  file  should  be,  or  contact  your  system  administrator for more
       information.

</pre><h4><b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The following is a list of the settings that <b>bombadillo</b> recognizes, as well as  a  description  of  their
       valid values.

       <b>configlocation</b>
              The path to the directory that the <u>.bombadillo.ini</u> configuration file is stored in. This is a <b>read</b>
              <b>only</b>  setting  and  cannot  be  changed  with  the  <u>set</u> command, but it can be read with the <u>check</u>
              command.

       <b>defaultscheme</b>
              The scheme that should be used when no scheme is present in a given URL. <u>gopher</u>, <u>gemini</u>, <u>http</u>, and
              <u>https</u> are valid values.

       <b>geminiblocks</b>
              Determines how to treat preformatted text blocks in text/gemini documents.  <u>block</u>  will  show  the
              contents of the block, <u>alt</u> will show any available alt text for the block, <u>both</u> will show both the
              content  and  the alt text, and <u>neither</u> will show neither. Unlike other settings, a change to this
              value will require a fresh page load to see the change.

       <b>homeurl</b>
              The url that <b>bombadillo</b> navigates to when the program loads or when the <u>home</u> or <u>h</u> LINE COMMAND  is
              issued. This should be a valid url. If a scheme/protocol is not included, gopher will be assumed.

       <b>maxwidth</b>
              The  number  of  characters at which lines should be wrapped. If this is bigger than the available
              terminal width, the full width of the terminal will be used. If a non-integer or an  integer  less
              than 10 is given, a default value will be used.

       <b>savelocation</b>
              The path to the directory that <b>bombadillo</b> should write files to. This must be a valid filepath for
              the system, must be a directory, and must already exist.

       <b>searchengine</b>
              The  url  to  use  for  the  LINE  COMMAND <u>search</u>. Should be a valid search path that terms may be
              appended to.

       <b>telnetcommand</b>
              Tells the browser what command to use to start a  telnet  session.  Should  be  a  valid  command,
              including any flags. The address being navigated to will be added to the end of the command.

       <b>theme</b>  Can toggle between visual modes. Valid values are <u>normal</u>, <u>color</u>, and <u>inverse</u>. When set to inverse,
              the  normal  mode  colors  are  inverted. Both normal and inverse modes filter out terminal escape
              sequences. When set to color, Bombadillo will render terminal escape sequences representing colors
              when it finds them in documents.

       <b>timeout</b>
              The number of seconds after which connections to gopher or gemini servers should time out  if  the
              server has not responded.

       <b>webmode</b>
              Controls  behavior  when  following  web  links. The following values are valid: <u>none</u> will disable
              following web links, <u>gui</u> will have the browser attempt to open  web  links  in  a  user's  default
              graphical  web  browser;  <u>lynx</u>,  <u>w3m</u>, and <u>elinks</u> will have the browser attempt to use the selected
              terminal web browser to handle the rendering of web pages and will display the pages  directly  in
              Bombadillo.
