</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Vimb - Vim Browser - A modal web browser based on WebKit, inspired by Vim: the great editor.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vimb</b> [<b>OPTIONS</b>] [<u>URI</u>|<u>file</u>|<u>-</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Vimb  is  a  WebKit  based  web browser that behaves like the Vimperator plugin for Firefox and has usage
       paradigms from the great editor, Vim.  The goal  of  Vimb  is  to  build  a  completely  keyboard-driven,
       efficient and pleasurable browsing-experience.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If  no <u>URI</u> or <u>file</u> is given, Vimb will open the configured home-page.  If <u>URI</u> is '-', Vimb reads the HTML
       to display from stdin.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--cmd</b> <u>CMD</u>
              Run <u>CMD</u> as ex command line right before the first page is loaded.  If the flag is used  more  than
              one  time,  the  commands  are  called  in  order  they are given.  You could also pass several ex
              commands in one <u>CMD</u>, if they are separated by "|".

              vimb --cmd "set dark-mode=on|set header=Referer,DNT=1"

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--config</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Use custom configuration given as <u>FILE</u>.  This will also be applied on new spawned instances.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--embed</b> <u>WINID</u>
              <u>WINID</u> of an XEmbed-aware application, that Vimb will use as its parent.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--incognito</b>
              Start an instance with user data read-only (see <u>FILES</u> section).

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show help options.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--profile</b> <u>PROFILE-NAME</u>
              Create or open specified configuration profile.  Configuration data for the profile is stored in a
              directory named <u>PROFILE-NAME</u> under default directory for configuration data.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print build and version information and then quit.

       <b>--no-maximize</b>
              Do no attempt to maximize window.

       <b>--bug-info</b>
              Prints information about used libraries for bug reports and then quit.

</pre><h4><b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       Vimb is modal and has the following main modes:

       Normal Mode
              The default mode.  Pressing Escape always enter normal mode.

       Input Mode
              Used for editing text elements in a webpage.

       Command Mode
              Execute `ex` commands from the builtin inputbox (commandline).

       Pass-Through Mode
              In Pass-Through mode only the `&lt;Esc&gt;` and `&lt;C-[&gt;` keybindings are interpreted by Vimb,  all  other
              keystrokes are given to the webview to handle them.  This allows the use of a website's configured
              keybindings, that might otherwise be swallowed by Vimb.

</pre><h4><b>NORMAL</b> <b>MODE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Some  of  the Normal Model Commands can have a numeric count to multiply the effect of the command.  If a
       command supports the count this is shown as [<b>N</b>].

   <b>General</b>
       <b>:</b>      Start Command Mode and print `:' to the input box.

       <b>gi</b>     Set cursor to the first editable element in the page and switch to Input Mode.

       <b>i</b>      Set cursor to the last focused element in the page and switch to Input Mode.  If  no  element  was
              focused before the first element is focused like with `gi'.

       <b>'{</b><u>A-Z</u><b>}</b> Jump to the global mark {<u>A-Z</u>} on a (possibly) different page.

       <b>''</b>     Jumps to the position before the latest jump, or where the last "m'" command was given.

   <b>Hinting</b>
       Hinting in Vimb is how you accomplish the tasks that you would do with the mouse in  common  mouse-driven
       browsers:  open  a URI, yank a URI, save a page and so on. When hinting is started, the relevant elements
       on the page will be marked by labels generated from configured `hint-keys'.  Hints  can  be  selected  by
       using &lt;Tab&gt;, &lt;C-I&gt; or &lt;C-Tab&gt;, &lt;C-O&gt;, by typing the chars of the label, or filtering the elements by some
       text  that  is part of the hinted element (like URI, link text, button label) or any combination of these
       methods.  If &lt;enter&gt; is pressed, the current active hint will  be  fired.   If  only  one  possible  hint
       remains, this will be fired automatically.

       <b>Syntax:</b> ;{mode}{hint}

       Start  Hints mode.  Different elements depending on <u>mode</u> are highlighted and `numbered'.  Elements can be
       selected either by typing their label, or by typing part of their text (<u>hint</u>) to narrow down the  result.
       When  an element has been selected, it is automatically clicked or used (depending on <u>mode</u>) and hint mode
       ends.

       The filtering of hints by text splits the query at ' ' and use the single parts as  separate  queries  to
       filter  the hints.  This is useful for hints that have a lot of filterable chars in common and many chars
       are required to make a distinct selection.  For example ';over tw' will easily select the second hint out
       of {'very long link text one', 'very long link text two'}.

       The following keys have special meanings in Hints modes:
       <b>&lt;CR&gt;</b>   Selects the first highlighted element, or the current focused.
       <b>&lt;Tab&gt;</b>  Moves the focus to the next hint element.
       <b>&lt;S-Tab&gt;</b>
              Moves the focus to the previous hint element.
       <b>&lt;Esc&gt;,</b> <b>CTRL-C,</b> <b>CTRL-[</b>
              Exits Hints mode without selecting an element.

       <b>Hint</b> <b>modes:</b>
              <b>f</b>      Is an alias for the <b>;o</b> hint mode.
              <b>F</b>      Is an alias for the <b>;t</b> hint mode.
              <b>;o</b>     Open hint's location in the current window.
              <b>;t</b>     Open hint's location in a new window.
              <b>;s</b>     Saves the hint's destination under the configured `download-path'.
              <b>;O</b>     Generate an `:open' prompt with hint's URI.
              <b>;T</b>     Generate an `:tabopen' prompt with hint's URI.
              <b>;e</b>     Open the configured editor (`editor-command') with the hinted form element's  content.   If
                     the  file in editor is saved and the editor is closed, the file content will be put back in
                     the form field.
              <b>;i</b>     Open hinted image in the current window.
              <b>;I</b>     Open hinted image in a new window.
              <b>;k</b>     Kill (remove) hinted element from the page.
              <b>;p</b>     Push the hint's URI to the end of the Read It Later queue like the `:qpush' command.   This
                     is only available if Vimb was compiled with the QUEUE feature.
              <b>;P</b>     Push  the  hint's  URI  to  the  beginning  of the Read It Later queue like the `:qunshift'
                     command.  This is only available if Vimb was compiled with the QUEUE feature.
              <b>;x</b>     Hints like ;o, but instead of opening the hinted URI, the `x-hint-command' is run in Vimb.
              <b>[</b><u>"x</u><b>];y</b> Yank hint's destination location into primary and secondary clipboard and into the register
                     <u>x</u>.
              <b>[</b><u>"x</u><b>];Y</b> Yank hint's text description or form text into primary and secondary clipboard and into the
                     register <u>x</u>.

       <b>Syntax:</b> g;{mode}{hint}
              Start an extended hints mode and stay there until &lt;Esc&gt; is pressed.  Like normal  hinting,  except
              that  after  a hint is selected, hints remain visible so that another one can be selected with the
              same action as the first.  Note that the  extended  hint  mode  can  only  be  combined  with  the
              following hint modes <u>I</u> <u>o</u> <u>p</u> <u>P</u> <u>s</u> <u>t</u> <u>y</u> <u>Y</u>.

       <b>Motion</b>
              Motions  commands  are  like those for normal mode except that CTRL is used as modifier.  But they
              can not be used together with a count.

              <b>CTRL-F</b> Scroll one page down.
              <b>CTRL-B</b> Scroll one page up.
              <b>CTRL-D</b> Scroll half page down.
              <b>CTRL-U</b> Scroll half page up.
              <b>CTRL-J</b> Scroll one step down.
              <b>CTRL-K</b> Scroll one step up.

   <b>Searching</b>
       <b>/</b><u>QUERY</u><b>,</b> <b>?</b><u>QUERY</u>
              Start searching for <u>QUERY</u> in the current page.  <u>/</u> start search forward, <u>?</u> in backward direction.

       <b>*</b>, <b>#</b>   Start searching for the current selected text, or if no text is selected for the  content  of  the
              primary  or  secondary  clipboard.   <u>*</u>  start  the  search  in forward direction and <u>#</u> in backward
              direction.

              Note that these commands will yank the text selection into the  clipboard  and  may  remove  other
              content from there!

       <b>[</b><u>N</u><b>]n</b>   Search for <u>N</u>nth next search result depending on current search direction.

       <b>[</b><u>N</u><b>]N</b>   Search for <u>N</u>nth previous search result depending on current search

       <b>&lt;CR&gt;</b>   Perform a click on element containing the current highlighted search result.  direction.

   <b>Zooming</b>
       <b>[</b><u>N</u><b>]zi</b>  Zoom-In the text of the page by <u>N</u> steps.

       <b>[</b><u>N</u><b>]zo</b>  Zoom-Out the text of the page by <u>N</u> steps.

       <b>[</b><u>N</u><b>]zI</b>  Full-Content Zoom-In the page by <u>N</u> steps.

       <b>[</b><u>N</u><b>]zO</b>  Full-Content Zoom-Out the page by <u>N</u> steps.

       <b>zz</b>     Reset Zoom.

   <b>Yank</b>
       <b>[</b><u>"x</u><b>]y</b>  Yank the URI or current page into register <u>x</u> and clipboard.

       <b>[</b><u>"x</u><b>]Y</b>  Yank the current selection into register x and clipboard.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       Commands that are listed below are ex-commands like in Vim, that are typed into the inputbox (the command
       line  of  vimb).   The  commands may vary in their syntax or in the parts they allow, but in general they
       follow a simple syntax.

       <b>Syntax:</b> :[:| ][N]cmd[name][!][ lhs][ rhs]

       Where <u>lhs</u> (left hand side) must not contain any unescaped space.  The syntax of the rhs (right hand side)
       if this is available depends on the command.  At the moment the count parts [N] of  commands  is  parsed,
       but currently there is no command that uses the count.

       Commands  that  are typed interactivly are normally recorded into command history and register.  To avoid
       this, the commands can be prefixed by one or more additional `:' or whitespace.

       Multiple commands, separated by a `|' can be given  in  a  single  command  line  and  will  be  executed
       consecutively.  The pipe can be included as an argument to a command by escaping it with a backslash.
       Following commands process the entire command-line string literally.  These commands will include any `|'
       as part of their argument string and so can not be followed by another command.

       - autocmd
       - cmap, cnoremap, imap, inoremap, nmap, nnoremap
       - eval
       - normal
       - open, tabopen
       - shellcmd

   <b>Command</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Editing</b>
       <b>&lt;Esc&gt;,</b> <b>CTRL-[,</b> <b>CTRL-C</b>
              Ignore all typed content and switch back to normal mode.

       <b>&lt;CR&gt;</b>   Submit the entered `ex` command or search query to run it.

       <b>CTRL-H</b> Deletes the char before the cursor.

       <b>CTRL-W</b> Deletes the last word before the cursor.

       <b>CTRL-U</b> Remove everything between cursor and prompt.

       <b>CTRL-B</b> Moves the cursor directly behind the prompt `:'.

       <b>CTRL-E</b> Moves the cursor after the prompt in inputbox.

       <b>CTRL-V</b> Pass the next key press directly to GTK.

       <b>CTRL-R</b> <b>{a-z"%:/;}</b>
              Insert  the  content  of  given register at cursor position.  See also section about `:reg[ister]'
              command.

   <b>Command</b> <b>Line</b> <b>History</b>
       <b>&lt;Tab&gt;</b>  Start completion of the content in the inputbox in forward direction.

       <b>&lt;S-Tab&gt;</b>
              Start completion of the content in the inputbox in backward direction.

       <b>&lt;Up&gt;</b>   Step backward in the command history.

       <b>&lt;Down&gt;</b> Step forward in the command history.  Yank the current selection into register <u>x</u> and clipboard.

   <b>Open</b>
       <b>:o[pen]</b> <b>[</b><u>URI</u><b>]</b>
              Open the give <u>URI</u> in the current window.  If <u>URI</u> is empty, the configured 'home-page' is opened.

       <b>:t[abopen]</b> <b>[</b><u>URI</u><b>]</b>
              Open the give <u>URI</u> in a new window.  If <u>URI</u> is empty, the configured 'home-page' is opened.

   <b>Key</b> <b>Mapping</b>
       Key mappings allow users to alter the actions of key presses.  Each key mapping is associated with a mode
       and only has effect when the mode is active.  The following commands allow the  user  to  substitute  one
       sequence of key presses by another.

       <b>Syntax:</b> :{m}map {lhs} {rhs}

       Note  that  the <u>lhs</u> ends with the first found space.  If you want to use space also in the {lhs} you have
       to escape this with a single '\', as shown in the examples.

       The <u>rhs</u> starts with the first non-space char. If you want a <u>rhs</u> that starts with a space, you have to use
       "&lt;Space&gt;".

       Standard key mapping commands are provided for these modes <u>m</u>:
       <b>n</b>      Normal mode: when browsing normally.
       <b>i</b>      Insert mode: when interacting with text fields on a website.
       <b>c</b>      Command Line mode: when typing into Vimb's command line.

       Most keys in key sequences are represented simply by the character that you see on the  screen  when  you
       type  them.  However, as a number of these characters have special meanings, and a number of keys have no
       visual representation, a special notation is required.

       As special key names have the format <u>&lt;...&gt;</u>.  The following  special  keys  can  be  used:  &lt;Left&gt;,  &lt;Up&gt;,
       &lt;Right&gt;,  &lt;Down&gt;  for the cursor keys, &lt;Tab&gt;, &lt;Esc&gt;, &lt;CR&gt;, &lt;Space&gt;, &lt;BS&gt;, &lt;F1&gt;-&lt;F12&gt; and &lt;C-A&gt;-&lt;C-Z&gt;.  If
       you want an actual sequence of keys like "&lt;", "C", "R", "&gt;" then escape with a backslash: "&lt;CR&gt;". If  you
       want a backslash followed by a special key then use &lt;Bslash&gt;.

       <b>:nm[ap]</b> <b>{</b><u>lhs</u><b>}</b> <b>{</b><u>rhs</u><b>}</b>
       <b>:im[ap]</b> <b>{</b><u>lhs</u><b>}</b> <b>{</b><u>rhs</u><b>}</b>
       <b>:cm[ap]</b> <b>{</b><u>lhs</u><b>}</b> <b>{</b><u>rhs</u><b>}</b>
              Map  the  key  sequence  <u>lhs</u>  to  <u>rhs</u>  for  the  modes where the map command applies.  The result,
              including <u>rhs</u>, is then further scanned for mappings.  This allows for nested and recursive use  of
              mappings.

              :cmap &lt;C-G&gt;h /home/user/downloads/
                     Adds  a  keybind  to  insert  a file path into the input box.  This could be useful for the
                     `:save' command that could be used as ":save ^Gh".
              :nmap &lt;F1&gt; :set scripts=on&lt;CR&gt;:open !glib&lt;Tab&gt;&lt;CR&gt;
                     This will enable scripts and lookup the first bookmarked URI with the tag `glib'  and  open
                     it immediately if F1 key is pressed.
              :nmap \ \  50G
                     Example which maps two spaces to go to 50% of the page.
       <b>:nn[oremap]</b> <b>{</b><u>lhs</u><b>}</b> <b>{</b><u>rhs</u><b>}</b>
       <b>:ino[remap]</b> <b>{</b><u>lhs</u><b>}</b> <b>{</b><u>rhs</u><b>}</b>
       <b>:cno[remap]</b> <b>{</b><u>lhs</u><b>}</b> <b>{</b><u>rhs</u><b>}</b>
              Map  the  key sequence <u>lhs</u> to <u>rhs</u> for the mode where the map command applies.  Disallow mapping of
              <u>rhs</u>, to avoid nested and recursive mappings.  Often used to redefine a command.
       <b>:nu[nmap]</b> <b>{</b><u>lhs</u><b>}</b>
       <b>:iu[nmap]</b> <b>{</b><u>lhs</u><b>}</b>
       <b>:cu[nmap]</b> <b>{</b><u>lhs</u><b>}</b>
              Remove the mapping of <u>lhs</u> for the applicable mode.

   <b>Bookmarks</b>
       <b>:bma</b> <b>[</b><u>tags</u><b>]</b>
              Save the current opened URI with <u>tags</u> to the bookmark file.

       <b>:bmr</b> <b>[</b><u>URI</u><b>]</b>
              Removes all bookmarks for given <u>URI</u> or, if not given, the current opened page.

   <b>Handlers</b>
       Handlers allow specifying external scripts to handle alternative URI methods.

       <b>:handler-add</b> <u>handler</u><b>=</b><u>cmd</u>
              Adds a handler to direct <u>handler</u> links to the external <u>cmd</u>.  The <u>cmd</u> can contain  one  placeholder
              `%s` that will be filled by the full URI given when the command is called.

              :handler-add mailto=urxvt -e mutt %s
                     to start email client for mailto links.
              :handler-add magnet=xdg-open %s
                     to open magnet links with xdg-open.
              :handler-add ftp=urxvt -e wget %s -P <a href="file:~/ftp-downloads">~/ftp-downloads</a>
                     to handle ftp downloads via wget.

       <b>:handler-remove</b> <u>handler</u>
              Remove the handler for the given URI <u>handler</u>.

   <b>Shortcuts</b>
       Shortcuts  allow  the  opening of an URI built up from a named template with additional parameters.  If a
       shortcut named 'dd' is defined, you can use it with `:open dd list of parameters' to open  the  generated
       URI.

       Shortcuts  are convenient to use with search engines where the URI is standardised and a single parameter
       is user defined.

       <b>:shortcut-add</b> <u>shortcut</u><b>=</b><u>URI</u>
              Adds a shortcut with the <u>shortcut</u> and <u>URI</u> template.  The <u>URI</u>  can  contain  multiple  placeholders
              $0-$9  that  will  be  filled by the parameters given when the shortcut is called.  The parameters
              given when the shortcut is called will be split into as many  parameters  like  the  highest  used
              placeholder.

              To  use  spaces  within  the  parameters,  the  parameters can be grouped by surrounding them with
              single-or double quotes-as shown in example shortcut `map'.

              :shortcut-add dl=https://duckduckgo.com/lite/?q=$0
                     to setup a search engine.  Can be called by `:open dl my search phrase'.
              :shortcut-add gh=https://github.com/$0/$1
                     to build URIs from given parameters.  Can be called `:open gh fanglingsu vimb'.
              :shortcut-add map=https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=$0&amp;daddr=$1
                     to search for a route, all but the last parameter must be quoted  if  they  contain  spaces
                     like `:open map "city hall, London" railway station, London'

       <b>:shortcut-remove</b> <u>shortcut</u>
              Remove the search engine to the given <u>shortcut</u>.

       <b>:shortcut-default</b> <u>shortcut</u>
              Set the shortcut for given <u>shortcut</u> as the default, that is the shortcut to be used if no shortcut
              is given and the string to open is not an URI. It doesn't matter if the <u>shortcut</u> is already in use
              or not to be able to set it.

   <b>Settings</b>
       <b>:se[t]</b> <u>var</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>
              Set  configuration  values  named  by  <u>var</u>.  To set boolean variable you should use 'on', 'off' or
              'true' and 'false'.  Colors are given as hexadecimal value like '#f57700'. Spaces or  more  equals
              signs in <u>value</u> just work without quotes: for example, ":set sans-serif-font=Some Sans Font".

       <b>:se[t]</b> <u>var</u><b>+=</b><u>value</u>
              Add  the  <u>value</u>  to a number option, or append the <u>value</u> to a string option.  When the option is a
              comma separated list, a comma is added, unless the value was empty.

       <b>:se[t]</b> <u>var</u><b>^=</b><u>value</u>
              Multiply the <u>value</u> to a number option, or prepend the <u>value</u> to a string option.  When  the  option
              is a comma separated list, a comma is added, unless the value was empty.

       <b>:se[t]</b> <u>var</u><b>-=</b><u>value</u>
              Subtract the <u>value</u> from a number option, or remove the <u>value</u> from a string option, if it is there.
              When the option is a comma separated list, a comma is deleted, unless the option becomes empty.

       <b>:se[t]</b> <u>var</u><b>?</b>
              Show the current set value of variable.  <u>VAR</u>.

       <b>:se[t]</b> <u>var</u><b>!</b>
              Toggle the value of boolean variable <u>var</u> and display the new set value.

   <b>Queue</b>
       The queue allows the marking of URIs for later reading.  This list is shared between the single instances
       of Vimb.

       <b>:qpu[sh]</b> <b>[</b><u>URI</u><b>]</b>
              Push <u>URI</u> or, if not given, the current URI to the end of the queue.

       <b>:qun[shift]</b> <b>[</b><u>URI</u><b>]</b>
              Push <u>URI</u> or, if not given, the current URI to the beginning of the queue.

       <b>:qp[op]</b>
              Open the oldest queue entry in the current browser window and remove it from the queue.

       <b>:qc[lear]</b>
              Removes all entries from queue.

   <b>Automatic</b> <b>commands</b>
       An autocommand is a command that is executed automatically in response to some event, such as a URI being
       opened.   Autocommands  are  very  powerful.  Use them with care and they will help you avoid typing many
       commands.

       Autocommands are built with following properties.

       <u>group</u>  When the [<u>group</u>] argument is not given, Vimb uses the current group as  defined  with  ':augroup',
              otherwise, Vimb uses the group defined with [<u>group</u>].  Groups are useful to remove multiple grouped
              autocommands.

       <u>event</u>  You can specify a comma separated list of event names.  No white space can be used in this list.

              Events:
              <b>LoadStarting</b>
                     Fired  before a new page is going to be opened.  No data has been sent or received yet, the
                     load may still fail for transport issues.
              <b>LoadStarted</b>
                     Fired if a new page is going to be opened.  No data has been received  yet,  the  load  may
                     still fail for transport issues.
              <b>LoadCommitted</b>
                     Fired  if  first  data chunk has arrived, meaning that the necessary transport requirements
                     are established, and the load is being performed.   This  is  the  right  event  to  toggle
                     content related setting like 'scripts', 'plugins' and such things.
              <b>LoadFinished</b>
                     Fires when everything that was required to display on the page has been loaded.
              <b>DownloadStarted</b>
                     Fired right after a download is started.
              <b>DownloadFinished</b>
                     Fired if a Vimb managed download is finished.
              <b>DownloadFailed</b>
                     Fired if a Vimb managed download failed.

       <u>pat</u>    Comma  separated  list  of patterns, matches in order to check if a autocommand applies to the URI
              associated to an event.  To use ',' within the single patterns this must be escaped as '\,'.

              Patterns:
              <b>*</b>      Matches any sequence of characters.  This includes also '/' in contrast to shell patterns.
              <b>?</b>      Matches any single character except of '/'.
              <b>{one,two}</b>
                     Matches 'one' or 'two'.  Any '{', ',' and '}' within this pattern must be escaped by a '\'.
                     '*' and '?' have no special meaning within the curly braces.
              <b>\</b>      Use backslash to escape the special meaning of '?*{},' in the pattern or pattern list.

       <u>cmd</u>    Any `ex` command vimb understands.  The leading ':' is not required.   Multiple  commands  can  be
              separated by '|'.

       <b>:au[tocmd]</b> <b>[</b><u>group</u><b>]</b> <b>{</b><u>event</u><b>}</b> <b>{</b><u>pat</u><b>}</b> <b>{</b><u>cmd</u><b>}</b>
              Add  <u>cmd</u>  to the list of commands that Vimb will execute automatically on <u>event</u> for a URI matching
              <u>pat</u> autocmd-patterns.  Vimb  always  adds  the  <u>cmd</u>  after  existing  autocommands,  so  that  the
              autocommands are executed in the order in which they were given.

       <b>:au[tocmd]!</b> <b>[</b><u>group</u><b>]</b> <b>{</b><u>event</u><b>}</b> <b>{</b><u>pat</u><b>}</b> <b>{</b><u>cmd</u><b>}</b>
              Remove  all  autocommands  associated  with <u>event</u> and which pattern match <u>pat</u>, and add the command
              <u>cmd</u>.  Note that the pattern is not matched literally to find  autocommands  to  remove,  like  Vim
              does.   Vimb  matches  the  autocommand  pattern  with  <u>pat</u>.   If  [<u>group</u>]  is  not given, deletes
              autocommands in current group, as noted above.

       <b>:au[tocmd]!</b> <b>[</b><u>group</u><b>]</b> <b>{</b><u>event</u><b>}</b> <b>{</b><u>pat</u><b>}</b>
              Remove all autocommands associated with <u>event</u>  and  which  pattern  matches  <u>pat</u>  in  given  group
              (current group by default).

       <b>:au[tocmd]!</b> <b>[</b><u>group</u><b>]</b> <b>*</b> <b>{</b><u>pat</u><b>}</b>
              Remove all autocommands with patterns matching <u>pat</u> for all events in given group (current group by
              default).

       <b>:au[tocmd]!</b> <b>[</b><u>group</u><b>]</b> <b>{</b><u>event</u><b>}</b>
              Remove all autocommands for <u>event</u> in given group (current group by default).

       <b>:au[tocmd]!</b> <b>[</b><u>group</u><b>]</b>
              Remove all autocommands in given group (current group by default).

       <b>:aug[roup]</b> <b>{</b><u>name</u><b>}</b>
              Define  the  autocmd group <u>name</u> for the following ":autocmd" commands.  The name "end" selects the
              default group.

       <b>:aug[roup]!</b> <b>{</b><u>name</u><b>}</b>
              Delete the autocmd group <u>name</u>.

       Example:
       :aug github
       :  au LoadCommitted * set scripts=off|set cookie-accept=never
       :  au LoadCommitted http{s,}://github.com/* set scripts=on
       :aug end

   <b>Misc</b>
       <b>:cl[eardata]</b> <b>[</b><u>dataTypes</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>timespan</u><b>]</b>
              Asynchronously clears the website data of the  given  list  of  <u>dataTypes</u>  modified  in  the  past
              <u>timespan</u>.  Note that the <u>dataTypes</u> must not contain spaces.  If <u>timespan</u> is not given, all website
              data will be removed.  Note that this effects all running instances of vimb.

              The <u>dataTypes</u> is a comma separated list of following types.

                     HTTP Strict Transport Security cache.
              <b>-</b>      Can be used to clear all known data types in case a <u>timespan</u> is used.

              The <u>timespan</u> is given as sequence of '[multiplier]<u>unit</u>' tupels with following units.
              <b>y</b>      year (365 days)

       <b>:sh[ellcmd]</b> <u>cmd</u>
              Runs  the  given  shell <u>cmd</u> syncron and print the output into inputbox.  The following patterns in
              <u>cmd</u> are expanded: '~username', '~/', '$VAR' and '${VAR}'.  A '\' before  these  patterns  disables
              the expansion.

              The following environment variables are set for called shell commands.
              <b>VIMB_URI</b>
                     This variable is set by Vimb every time a new page is opened to the URI of the page.

              <b>VIMB_XID</b>
                     Holds  the  X-Window  id  of the Vimb window or of the embedding window if Vimb is compiled
                     with XEMBED and started with the -e option.
       <b>:sh[ellcmd]!</b> <u>cmd</u>
              Like :sh[ellcmd] but asynchronous.

              Example:
              :sh! <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> -c 'echo "`date` $VIMB_URI" &gt;&gt; myhistory.txt'
       <b>:s[ave]</b> <b>[</b><u>path</u><b>]</b>
              Download current opened page into configured download directory.  If <u>path</u> is given, download under
              this file name or path.  <u>path</u> is expanded and can therefore contain  '~/',  '${ENV}'  and  '~user'
              pattern.
       <b>:so[urce]</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u><b>]</b>
              Read ex commands from <u>file</u>.

       <b>:reg[ister]</b>
              Display the contents of all registers.
              Registers:
              <b>"a</b> — <b>"z</b>
                     26 named registers "a to "z.  Vimb fills these registers only when you say so.
              <b>":</b>     Last executed `ex` command.
              <b>""</b>     Last yanked content.
              <b>"%</b>     Curent opened URI.
              <b>"/</b>     Last search phrase.

              Example: :eval document.cookie

       <b>:e[val]!</b> <u>javascript</u>
              Like :eval, but there is nothing print to the input box.

       <b>:no[rmal]</b> <b>[</b><u>cmds</u><b>]</b>
              Execute  normal  mode commands <u>cmds</u>.  This makes it possible to execute normal mode commands typed
              on the input box.

              <u>cmds</u> cannot start with a space.  Put a count of 1 (one) before it, "1 " is one space.

              Example: :set scripts!|no! R

       <b>:no[rmal]!</b> <b>[</b><u>cmds</u><b>]</b>
              Like :normal, but no mapping is applied to <u>cmds</u>.

       <b>:ha[rdcopy]</b>
              Print current document.  Open a GUI dialog where you can select the  printer,  number  of  copies,
              orientation, etc.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>&lt;Esc&gt;</b>, <b>CTRL-[</b>
              Switch back to normal mode.

       <b>CTRL-O</b> Executes the next command as normal mode command and return to input mode.

       <b>CTRL-T</b> Open configured editor with content of current form field.

       <b>CTRL-V</b> Pass the next key press directly to WebKit.

       <b>CTRL-Z</b> Enter the pass-through mode.

</pre><h4><b>COMPLETIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  completions  are triggered by pressing `&lt;Tab&gt;` or `&lt;S-Tab&gt;` in the activated inputbox.  Depending of
       the current inserted content different completions are started.  The completion  takes  additional  typed
       chars to filter the completion list that is shown.

       <b>commands</b>
              The  completion  for  commands are started when at least `:` is shown in the inputbox.  If initial
              chars are passed, the completion will lookup those commands that begin with the given chars.

       <b>settings</b>
              The setting name completion is started if at least `:set ` is shown  in  inputbox  and  does  also
              match settings that begins with already typed setting prefix.

       <b>history</b>
              The  history of URIs is shown for the `:open ` and `:tabopen ` commands.  This completion looks up
              every given word in the history URI and titles.  Only those history items  are  shown,  where  the
              title or URI contains all tags.

              :open foo bar&lt;Tab&gt;
                     will complete only URIs that contain the words foo and bar.

       <b>bookmarks</b>
              The  bookmark completion is similar to the history completion, but does match only the tags of the
              bookmarks.  The bookmark completion is started by `:open <b>!</b>`, `:tabopen <b>!</b>` or `:bmr `  and  does  a
              prefix search for all given words in the bookmark tags.

              :open <b>!</b>foo ba
                     will match all bookmarks that have tags starting with "foo" and "ba".  If the bookmark does
                     not have any tags set, the URL is split on `.' and `/' into tags.

              :bmr tag
                     will match all bookmarks that have tags starting with "tag".

       <b>bookmark</b> <b>tags</b>
              The  bookmark  tag  completion  allows  the  insertion  of  already used bookmarks for the `:bma `
              commands.

       <b>search</b> The search completion allows a filtered list of already done searches.  This completion starts  by
              `/` or `?` in inputbox and performs a prefix comparison for further typed chars.

                     The URI of the current opened page, normally the page where the download was started  from,
                     also known as referer.
              <b>$VIMB_DOWNLOAD_PATH</b>
                     Setting value of 'download-path' which would be used normally for downloads.

       <b>download-path</b> <b>(string)</b>
              Path to the default download directory.  If no download directory is set, download will be written
              into  current  directory.  The following pattern will be expanded if the download is started '~/',
              '~user', '$VAR' and '${VAR}'.

       <b>download-use-external</b> <b>(bool)</b>
              Indicates if the external download tool  set  as  'download-command'  should  be  used  to  handle

              to run it in the foreground.

       <b>font-size</b> <b>(int)</b>
              The default font size used to display text.

       <b>frame-flattening</b> <b>(bool)</b>
              Whether to enable the Frame Flattening.  With this  setting  each  subframe  is  expanded  to  its
              contents, which will flatten all the frames to become one scrollable page.

       <b>fullscreen</b> <b>(bool)</b>
              Show the current window full-screen.

       <b>hardware-acceleration-policy</b> <b>(string)</b>

              <b>ondemand</b>
                     enables the hardware acceleration when the web contents request it, disabling it again when
                     no longer needed.
              <b>always</b> enforce hardware acceleration to be enabled.
              <b>never</b>  disables  it  completely.   Note  that  disabling  hardware  acceleration  might cause some
                     websites to not render correctly or consume more CPU.

       <b>header</b> <b>(list)</b>
              Comma separated list of headers that replaces default header sent by WebKit or new  headers.   The
              format for the header list elements is `name[=[value]]'.

              Note  that  these  headers  will  replace  already existing headers.  If there is no '=' after the
              header name, then the complete header will be removed from the request,  if  the  '='  is  present
              means that the header value is set to empty value.

              Note  that  webkit  reused  already  set  headers  in case of a reload of a page.  So if there are
              headers removed that where previously use to access a certain page and the  page  is  reloaded  or
              opened  via  back/forward  history the header will still be sent.  To apply the new header setting
              properly it's required to request another page or to open current page new by `O&lt;Cr&gt;`.

              To use '=' within a header value the value must be quoted like shown in  Example  for  the  Cookie
              header.

              :set header=DNT=1,User-Agent,Cookie='name=value'
                     Send  the  'Do  Not  Track'  header  with  each  request  and  remove the User-Agent Header
                     completely from request.

       <b>hint-follow-last</b> <b>(bool)</b>
              If on, vimb automatically follows the last remaining hint on the page.  If  off  hints  are  fired
              only if enter is pressed.

       <b>hint-keys-same-length</b> <b>(bool)</b>
              If on, all hint labels will have the same length, so no hints will be ambiguous.

       <b>hint-timeout</b> <b>(int)</b>
              Timeout  before  automatically  following  a  non-unique  numerical hint.  To disable auto fire of
              hints, set this value to 0.

       <b>hint-keys</b> <b>(string)</b>
              The keys used to label and select hints.  With its default value, each hint  has  a  unique  label
              which  can  be  typed  to  select it, while all other characters are used to filter hints based on
              their text.  With a value such as asdfg;lkjh, each hint is `labeled' based on  the  characters  of
              the home row.

              If  the  hint-keys string starts with a '0' the keys are considered to follow the rules of numeric
              labeling. So that the ifrst char of the label will never start with the '0'.

              Note that the hint matching by label built of hint-keys is case sensitive.  In this  vimb  differs
              from some other browsers that show hint labels in upper case, but match them lowercase.

              To  have  upper  case  hint  labels, it's possible to add following css to the `style.css' file in
              vimb's configuration directory.

              "span[vimbhint="label"] {text-transform: uppercase !important;}"

       <b>hint-match-element</b> <b>(bool)</b>
              If this is set to 'true' typed chars that are not part of the set 'hint-keys' are used  to  filter
              hinted  DOM  elements  by their text value.  If 'hint-keys' are set to chars instead of numbers it
              might be useful to disable matching of the elements by 'hint-match-element=false'.

       <b>history-max-items</b> <b>(int)</b>
              Maximum number of unique items stored in search-, command or URI history.  If history-max-items is
              set to 0, the history file will not be changed.  This setting has no effect if option  --incognito
              is set.

       <b>home-page</b> <b>(string)</b>
              Homepage that vimb opens if started without a URI.
