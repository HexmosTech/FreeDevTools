       <b>LAMMPS</b> - Molecular Dynamics Simulator.  Version 7 February 2024

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lmp</b> -in &lt;input file&gt; [OPTIONS] ...

       or

       mpirun -np 2 <b>lmp</b> -in &lt;input file&gt; [OPTIONS] ...

       or

       <b>lmp</b> -r2data file.restart file.data

       or

       <b>lmp</b> -h

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>LAMMPS</b>  is a classical molecular dynamics code, and an acronym for <b>L</b>arge-scale <b>A</b>tomic/<b>M</b>olecular <b>M</b>assively
       <b>P</b>arallel <b>S</b>imulator.  <b>LAMMPS</b> has potentials for soft materials (bio-molecules, polymers)  and  solid-state
       materials  (metals,  semiconductors)  and  coarse-grained  or mesoscopic systems. It can be used to model
       atoms or, more generically, as a parallel particle simulator at the atomic, meso, or continuum scale.

       See https://www.lammps.org/ for more information and documentation.

</pre><h4><b>EXECUTABLE</b> <b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>LAMMPS</b> executable can have  different  names  depending  on  how  it  was  configured,  compiled  and
       installed.  It  will  be  either <b>lmp</b> or <b>lmp_&lt;machine</b> <b>name&gt;.</b>  The &lt;machine name&gt; suffix corresponds to the
       (machine specific) makefile used to compile <b>LAMMPS</b>  when  using  the  conventional  build  process.  When
       building  <b>LAMMPS</b>  using  <b>CMake</b>  this  &lt;machine name&gt; parameter can be chosen arbitrarily at configuration
       time, but more common is to just use <b>lmp</b> without a suffix. In this man page we will use <b>lmp</b> to  represent
       any of those names.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b> or <b>-help</b>
              Print  a  brief  help summary and a list of settings and options compiled into this executable. It
              also explicitly lists all LAMMPS styles (atom_style, fix, compute,  pair_style,  bond_style,  etc)
              available  in  the  specific  executable.  This  can  tell  you if the command you want to use was
              included via the appropriate package at compile time.  LAMMPS will print the info and  immediately
              exit if this switch is used.

       <b>-e</b> or <b>-echo</b>
              Set  the  style  of command echoing. The style can be <b>none</b> or <b>screen</b> or <b>log</b> or <b>both.</b>  Depending on
              the style, each command read from the input script will be echoed to the  screen  and/or  logfile.
              This can be useful to figure out which line of your script is causing an input error.  The default
              value is <b>log.</b>

       <b>-i</b> <b>&lt;input</b> <b>file&gt;</b> or <b>-in</b> <b>&lt;input</b> <b>file&gt;</b>
              Specify  a  file  to  use as an input script. If it is not specified, LAMMPS reads its script from
              standard input. This is a required switch when running LAMMPS in multi-partition mode.

       <b>-k</b> <b>on/off</b> <b>[keyword</b> <b>value]</b> or <b>-kokkos</b> <b>on/off</b> <b>[keyword</b> <b>value]</b>
              Enable or disable general KOKKOS support, as provided by the KOKKOS package.  Even  if  LAMMPS  is
              built  with  this  package,  this  switch  must be set to <b>on</b> to enable running with KOKKOS-enabled
              styles. More details on this switch and  its  optional  keyword  value  pairs  are  discussed  at:
              https://docs.lammps.org/Run_options.html

       <b>-l</b> <b>&lt;log</b> <b>file&gt;</b> or <b>-log</b> <b>&lt;log</b> <b>file&gt;</b>
              Specify  a log file for LAMMPS to write status information to.  The default value is "log.lammps".
              If the file name "none" is used, <b>LAMMPS</b> will not write a log file. In  multi-partition  mode  only
              some  high-level  all-partition  information is written to the "&lt;log file&gt;" file, the remainder is
              written in a per-partition file "&lt;log file&gt;.N" with "N" being  the  respective  partition  number,
              unless overridden by the -plog flag (see below).

       <b>-m</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b> or <b>-mpicolor</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b>
              If used, this must be the first command-line argument after the <b>LAMMPS</b> executable name. It is only
              used  when  <b>LAMMPS</b>  is  launched  by  an  mpirun  command  which  also  launches one or more other
              executable(s) at the same time.  <b>LAMMPS</b> and the other executable(s) perform  an  MPI_Comm_split(),
              each with their own different colors, to split the MPI_COMM_WORLD communicator for each executable
              to  the  subset of processors they are supposed to be actually running on. Currently, this is only
              used in <b>LAMMPS</b> to perform client/server messaging with another application.   <b>LAMMPS</b>  can  act  as
              either a client or server (or both).

       <b>-mdi</b> <b>'&lt;mdi_flags&gt;'</b>
              This  flag  is  only  recognized  and used when <b>LAMMPS</b> has support for the MolSSI Driver Interface
              (MDI) included as part of the MDI package.  This flag is specific to the MDI library and  controls
              how  <b>LAMMPS</b> interacts with MDI.  There are usually multiple flags that have to follow it and those
              have to be placed in quotation marks.  For more information about how  to  launch  LAMMPS  in  MDI
              client/server mode please refer to the MDI How-to at  https://docs.lammps.org/Howto_mdi.html

       <b>-c</b> or <b>-cite</b> <b>&lt;style</b> <b>or</b> <b>filename&gt;</b>
              Select  how and where to output a reminder about citing contributions to the <b>LAMMPS</b> code that were
              used during the run. Available keywords for styles are "both", "none", "screen",  or  "log".   Any
              other  keyword  will  be  considered a file name to write the detailed citation info to instead of
              logfile or screen.  Default is the "log" style where there is a short summary in the screen output
              and detailed citations in BibTeX format in the logfile.  The option "both"  selects  the  detailed
              output  for  both, "none", the short output for both, and "screen" will write the detailed info to
              the screen and the short version to the log file.  If a dedicated citation info file is requested,
              the screen and log file output will be in the short format (same as with "none").

              See https://docs.lammps.org/Intro_citing.html for more details on how to correctly  reference  and
              cite <b>LAMMPS</b>

       <b>-nc</b> or <b>-nocite</b>
              Disable  writing  the  "log.cite"  file  which is normally written to list references for specific
              cite-able features used during a <b>LAMMPS</b> run.

       <b>-pk</b> <b>&lt;style&gt;</b> <b>[options]</b> or <b>-package</b> <b>&lt;style&gt;</b> <b>[options]</b>
              Invoke the <b>package</b> command with &lt;style&gt; and optional arguments.  The syntax is the same as if  the
              command  appeared  in  an input script.  For example "-pk gpu 2" is the same as "package gpu 2" in
              the input script. The possible styles and options are discussed  in  the  <b>LAMMPS</b>  manual  for  the
              "package"  command.  This switch can be used multiple times, e.g. to set options for the INTEL and
              OPENMP packages when used together. Along with the "-sf" or "-suffix" switch, this is a convenient
              mechanism for invoking accelerator packages and their options without  having  to  edit  an  input
              script.

       <b>-p</b> or <b>-partition</b>
              Invoke  <b>LAMMPS</b>  in  multi-partition mode. Without this, <b>LAMMPS</b> uses all P processors allocated via
              MPI to run a single simulation.  If this switch is used, the P processors are split into  separate
              partitions  and  each  partition  runs its own simulation. The arguments to the switch specify the
              number of processors in each partition.  Arguments of the form "MxN" mean M partitions, each  with
              N  processors.   Arguments  of the form "N" mean a single partition with N processors.  The sum of
              processors in all partitions must be equal P. Thus  the  command  “-partition  8x2  4  5”  has  10
              partitions and runs on a total of 25 processors.  Running with multiple partitions is required for
              multi-replica simulations, where each replica runs on on one or more few processors.

       <b>-pl</b> <b>&lt;basename&gt;</b> or <b>-plog</b> <b>&lt;basename&gt;</b>
              Specify  the  base name for the per-partition log files in multi-partition runs, where partition N
              writes log information to &lt;basename&gt;.N.  If basename is set to "none", then no  per-partition  log
              files are created.  This overrides the name specified in the -log command-line option.

       <b>-ps</b> <b>&lt;basename&gt;</b> or <b>-pscreen</b> <b>&lt;basename&gt;</b>
              Specify  the base name for the per-partition screen files in multi-partition runs, where partition
              N writes screen output to &lt;basename&gt;.N.  If basename is  set  to  "none",  then  no  per-partition
              screen files are created.  The default value is "screen" or whatever is set by the -screen flag.

       <b>-r2data</b> <b>&lt;restart</b> <b>file&gt;</b> <b>[remap]</b> <b>&lt;data</b> <b>file&gt;</b> or
              <b>-restart2data</b>  <b>&lt;restart</b>  <b>file&gt;</b>  <b>[remap]</b>  <b>&lt;data</b>  <b>file&gt;</b> Convert &lt;restart file&gt; previously written by
              <b>LAMMPS</b> into a data file and immediately exit. This option has replaced the  external  restart2data
              executable. Following &lt;restart file&gt; argument, the optional word "remap" may be used. This has the
              same effect like adding it to a "read_restart" command.  The syntax following the &lt;data file&gt; name
              is  identical  to  the arguments of the "write_data" command. See the <b>LAMMPS</b> manual for details on
              either of the two commands.

       <b>-r2dump</b> <b>&lt;restart</b> <b>file&gt;</b> <b>[remap]</b> <b>&lt;dump</b> <b>file&gt;</b> or
              <b>-restart2dump</b> <b>&lt;restart</b> <b>file&gt;</b> <b>[remap]</b> <b>&lt;dump</b> <b>file&gt;</b> Convert  &lt;restart  file&gt;  previously  written  by
              <b>LAMMPS</b> into a dump file and immediately exit. Following &lt;restart file&gt; argument, the optional word
              "remap"  may  be  used.  This has the same effect like adding it to a "read_restart" command.  The
              syntax following the &lt;dump file&gt; name is identical to the arguments of the "dump" command. See the
              <b>LAMMPS</b> manual for details on either of the two commands.

       <b>-sc</b> <b>&lt;file</b> <b>name&gt;</b> or <b>-screen</b> <b>&lt;file</b> <b>name&gt;</b>
              Specify a file for <b>LAMMPS</b> to write its screen  information  to.  By  default,  this  will  be  the
              standard  output.  If  &lt;file  name&gt; is "none", (most) screen output will be suppressed.  In multi-
              partition mode only some high-level all-partition information is written to the screen  or  "&lt;file
              name&gt;"  file,  the remainder is written in a per-partition file "screen.N" or "&lt;file name&gt;.N" with
              "N" being the respective partition number, and unless overridden by the -pscreen flag (see above).

       <b>-sf</b> <b>&lt;suffix&gt;</b> or <b>-suffix</b> <b>&lt;suffix&gt;</b>
              Use variants of various styles in the input, if they exist.  This  is  achieved  by  transparently
              trying to convert a style named &lt;my/style&gt; into &lt;my/style/suffix&gt; if that latter style exists, but
              otherwise  fall  back  to  the  former. The most useful suffixes are  "gpu", "intel", "kk", "omp",
              "opt", or "hybrid". These refer to styles from optional packages that LAMMPS can  be  built  with.
              The  hybrid  suffix  is  special, as it enables, having two suffixes tried (e.g. first "intel" and
              then "omp") and thus requires two arguments. Along with the "-package" command-line  switch,  this
              is  a convenient mechanism for invoking styles from accelerator packages and setting their options
              without having to edit an input script.

       <b>-sr</b> or <b>-skiprun</b>
              Insert the command "timer timeout 0 every 1" at the beginning of an input file or after a  "clear"
              command.   This  has the effect that the entire <b>LAMMPS</b> input script is processed without executing
              actual "run" or "minimize" or similar commands (their  main  loops  are  skipped).   This  can  be
              helpful and convenient to test input scripts of long running calculations for correctness to avoid
              having them crash after a long time due to a typo or syntax error in the middle or at the end.

              See  https://docs.lammps.org/Run_options.html  for  additional details and discussions on command-
              line options.

</pre><h4><b>LAMMPS</b> <b>BASICS</b></h4><pre>
       LAMMPS executes by reading commands from a input script (text file), one line at a time.  When the  input
       script  ends,  LAMMPS  exits.   Each  command causes LAMMPS to take some action.  It may set or change an
       internal, read and parse a file, or run a simulation.  Most commands have default settings,  which  means
       you only need to use the command if you wish to change the default.

       The  ordering of commands in an input script is usually not very important unless a command like "run" is
       encountered, which starts some calculation using the current internal state. Also, if a  "pair_style"  or
       "bond_style"  other  similar  style  command is issued that has a different name from what was previously
       active, it will replace the previous style and wipe out all corresponding "pair_coeff" or "bond_coeff" or
       equivalent settings.  Some commands are only valid when they follow  other  commands.   For  example  you
       cannot  set the temperature of a group of atoms until atoms have been defined and a group command is used
       to define which atoms belong to the group of a given name. Sometimes command B will use values  that  can
       be set by command A. This means command A must precede command B in the input to have the desired effect.
       Some  commands  must  be issued <b>before</b> the simulation box is defined and others can only be issued <b>after.</b>
       Many input script errors are detected by <b>LAMMPS</b>  and  an  ERROR  or  WARNING  message  is  printed.   The
       documentation  for  each  command  lists  restrictions on how the command can be used, and the chapter on
       errors in the <b>LAMMPS</b> manual gives some additional information about error messages, if possible.
