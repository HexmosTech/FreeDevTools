</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       collect  is  an  sos  subcommand  to collect sos reports from multiple nodes and package them in a single
       useful tar archive.

       sos collect can be run either on a workstation that has SSH key authentication setup for the nodes  in  a
       given cluster, or from a "primary" node in a cluster that has SSH keys configured for the other nodes.

       Some  sos  report  options are supported by sos-collect and are passed directly to the sos report command
       run on each node.

       <b>Note:</b> the <b>sos-collector</b> command has been deprecated and will be removed  in  sos-4.9.  Use  the  new  <b>sos</b>
       <b>collect</b> syntax instead.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>, <b>--alloptions</b>
              Enables all sos report options.

              This does NOT enable all sos collect options.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--become</b>
              Become the root user on the remote node when connecting as a non-root user.

       <b>--batch</b>
              Run in non-interactive mode. This will skip prompts for user input.

       <b>--all-logs</b>
              Report option. Collects all logs regardless of size.

              Default: no

       <b>-c</b> CLUSTER_OPTIONS
              Specify options used by cluster profiles. The format is 'profile.option_name=value'.

              For example, for the ovirt plugin if you wanted to restrict node enumeration to a specific cluster
              you would use <b>'-c</b> <b>ovirt.cluster=example_cluster'</b>.

              Available cluster options can be listed by running <b>'sos</b> <b>collect</b> <b>-l'</b>.

       <b>--chroot</b> CHROOT
              Report  option.  Set  the  chroot  mode. When <b>--sysroot</b> is used commands default to executing with
              SYSROOT as the root directory. This can be overridden by  setting  <b>--chroot</b>  to  "always"  (always
              chroot) or "never" (always run in the host namespace).

       <b>--case-id</b> CASE_ID
              Report option. Specifies a case number identifier.

       <b>--cluster-type</b> CLUSTER_TYPE
              When  run  by  itself,  sos collect will attempt to identify the type of cluster at play.  This is
              done by checking package or configuration information against the localhost, or the  primary  node
              if  <b>"--primary"</b> is supplied.

              Setting <b>--cluster-type</b> skips this step and forcibly sets a particular profile.

              Using  a  value  of  <b>none</b>  or  <b>jbon</b>  (just a bunch of nodes) will effectively disable all cluster-
              specific checks, and cause sos collect to only use the nodes specified by the <b>--nodes</b> option. Note
              that in this scenario, regex string(s) for node names will be ignored.

              Example: <b>sos</b> <b>collect</b> <b>--cluster-type=kubernetes</b> will force the kubernetes profile to  be  run,  and
              thus set sos report options and attempt to determine a list of nodes using that profile.

       <b>--container-runtime</b> RUNTIME
               <b>sos</b>  <b>report</b>  option. Using this with <b>collect</b> will pass this option thru to nodes with sos version
              4.3 or later. This option controls the default container runtime plugins will use for collections.
              See <b>man</b> <b>sos-report</b>.

       <b>-e</b> ENABLE_PLUGINS, <b>--enable-plugins</b> ENABLE_PLUGINS
              Report option. Use this to enable a plugin that would otherwise not be run.

              This option supports providing a comma-delimited list of plugins.

       <b>--encrypt-key</b> <b>KEY</b>
              Encrypts the resulting archive that sos collect produces using GPG. KEY must be an existing key in
              the user's keyring as GPG does not allow for keyfiles.  KEY can be any  value  accepted  by  gpg's
              'recipient' option.

              Note that the user running sos collect must match the user owning the keyring from which keys will
              be  obtained.  In  particular this means that if sudo is used to run sos collect, the keyring must
              also be set up using sudo (or direct shell access to the account).

              Users should be aware that encrypting the final archive will result in sos using double the amount
              of temporary disk space - the encrypted archive  must  be  written  as  a  separate,  rather  than
              replacement,  file  within  the  temp directory that sos writes the archive to. However, since the
              encrypted archive will be the same size as the original archive,  there  is  no  additional  space
              consumption once the temporary directory is removed at the end of execution.

              This means that only the encrypted archive is present on disk after sos finishes running.

              If encryption fails for any reason, the original unencrypted archive is preserved instead.

              IMPORTANT:  As of this version of sos collect, only the final archive on the local machine running
              sos collect will be encrypted. The individual sos reports that are collected on the nodes will  be
              collected unencrypted.

       <b>--encrypt-pass</b> <b>PASS</b>
              The same as --encrypt-key, but use the provided PASS for symmetric encryption rather than key-pair
              encryption.

       <b>--group</b> GROUP
              Specify an existing host group definition to use.

              Host  groups  are pre-defined settings for the cluster-type, primary node, and nodes options saved
              in JSON-formatted files under <a href="file:/etc/sos/groups.d/">/etc/sos/groups.d/</a>&lt;GROUP&gt;.

              If cluster_type and/or primary are set in the group, sos collect behaves as if these  values  were
              specified on the command-line.

              If  nodes  is  defined,  sos collect <b>extends</b> the <b>--nodes</b> option, if set, with the nodes or regexes
              listed in the group.

              Note that sos collect will only write group definitions to <a href="file:/etc/sos/groups.d/">/etc/sos/groups.d/</a>  however  the  GROUP
              value  may  be a filename for any group definitions that exist outside of the default location. If
              you are manually writing these files, use the value <b>null</b>  when  a  python  NoneType  is  expected.
              Caveat: use <b>string</b> 'none' if setting cluster_type to none.

       <b>--save-group</b> GROUP
              Save the results of this run of sos collect to a host group definition.

              sos-collector  will  write  a  JSON-formatted  file with name GROUP to <a href="file:/etc/sos/groups.d/">/etc/sos/groups.d/</a> with the
              settings for cluster-type, primary, and the node list as discovered by cluster enumeration.   Note
              that this means regexes are not directly saved to host groups, but the results of matching against
              those regexes are.

       <b>-j</b> JOBS <b>--jobs</b> JOBS
              Specify the number of concurrent node collections that should be run.

              If  the  number  of  nodes  enumerated  exceeds  the  number  of JOBS, then sos collect will start
              collecting from the first X number of nodes and then continue to  iterate  through  the  remaining
              nodes as sos report collection finishes.

              Defaults to 4.

       <b>--nopasswd-sudo</b>
              Use this option when connecting as a non-root user that has passwordless sudo configured.

              If  this  option  is  omitted and a bogus sudo password is supplied, collection of sos reports may
              exhibit unexpected behavior and/or fail entirely.

       <b>-k</b> PLUGIN_OPTION, <b>--plugin-option</b> PLUGIN_OPTION
              Report  option.  Set  a  plugin  option  to  a  particular  value.  This   takes   the   form   of
              plugin_name.option_name=value.

              Example: To enable the kubernetes "all" option in sos report use <b>-k</b> <b>kubernetes.all=on</b>.

       <b>--label</b> LABEL
              Specify  a  label  to  be  added  to the archive names. This label will be applied to both the sos
              collect archive and the sos report archives.

              If a cluster sets a default label, the user-provided  label  will  be  appended  to  that  cluster
              default.

        <b>--log-size</b> SIZE
              Places  a  limit  on  the  size  of collected logs and output in MiB. Note that this causes sos to
              capture the last X amount of the file or command output collected.

              By default, this is set to 25 MiB and applies to all files and command output collected  with  the
              exception of journal collections, which are limited to 100 MiB.

              Setting  this value to 0 removes all size limitations, and any files or commands collected will be
              collected in their entirety, which may drastically increase the  size  of  the  final  sos  report
              tarball  and  the  memory  usage of sos during collection of commands, such as very large journals
              that may be several GiB in size.

       <b>-n</b> SKIP_PLUGINS, <b>--skip-plugins</b> SKIP_PLUGINS
              Report option. Disable (skip) a particular plugin that would otherwise run.  This is useful  if  a
              particular plugin is prone to hanging for one reason or another.

              This option supports providing a comma-delimited list of plugins.

       <b>--nodes</b> NODES
              Provide  a comma-delimited list of nodes to collect sos reports from, or a regex string to be used
              to compare discovered node names against. If using a regex, only nodes matching the regex will  be
              used - i.e. it can be used as a whitelist but not a blacklist.

              This  option  can  be  handed multiple regex strings separated by commas. Additionally, both whole
              node names/addresses and regex strings may be provided at the same time.

       <b>--no-pkg-check</b>
              Do not perform package checks. Most cluster profiles check against installed packages to determine
              if the cluster profile should be applied or not.

              Use this with <b>--cluster-type</b> if there are rpm or apt issues on the primary/local node.

       <b>--no-local</b>
              Do not collect a sos report from the local system.

              If <b>--primary</b> is not supplied, it is assumed that the host  running  sos  report  is  part  of  the
              cluster that is to be collected. Use this option to skip collection of a local sos report.

              This option is NOT needed if <b>--primary</b> is provided.

       <b>--primary</b> PRIMARY
              Specify a primary node IP address or hostname for the cluster.

              If provided, then sos collect will check the primary node, not localhost, for determining the type
              of cluster in use.

       <b>--image</b> <b>IMAGE</b>
              Specify an image to use for the temporary container created for collections on containerized host,
              if  you do not want to use the default image specified by the host's policy. Note that this should
              include the registry.

       <b>--force-pull-image</b> <b>TOGGLE,</b> <b>--pull</b> <b>TOGGLE</b>
              When collecting an sos report from a containerized  host,  force  the  host  to  always  pull  the
              specified image, even if that image already exists on the host.  This is useful to ensure that the
              latest version of that image is always in use.  Disabling this option will use whatever version of
              the image is present on the node, and only attempt a pull if there is no copy of the image present
              at all.

              Enable with true/on/yes or disable with false/off/no

              Default: true

       <b>--registry-user</b> <b>USER</b>
              Specify the username to authenticate to the registry with in order to pull the container image

       <b>--registry-password</b> <b>PASSWORD</b>
              Specify the password to authenticate to the registry with in order to pull the container image. If
              no password is required, leave this blank.

       <b>--registry-authfile</b> <b>FILE</b>
              Specify  the  filename to use for providing authentication credentials to the registry to pull the
              container image.

              Note that this file must exist on the node(s) performing the pull operations, not  the  node  from
              which <b>sos</b> <b>collect</b> was run.

       <b>-o</b> ONLY_PLUGINS, <b>--only-plugins</b> ONLY_PLUGINS
              Report option. Run ONLY the plugins listed.

              Note  that  a  cluster  profile  will  NOT  override  this  option. This may cause the sos reports
              generated to not contain the relevant output for a given type of cluster.

              This option supports providing a comma-delimited list of plugins.

       <b>--password</b>
              Specifying this option will cause sos collect to prompt the user for an SSH password that will  be
              used to connect to all nodes.

              If  you have differing passwords for the same user across cluster nodes, you should ideally deploy
              SSH keys, but the --password-per-node option is also available.

       <b>--password-per-node</b>
              When using this option, sos collect will prompt the user for the SSH password for each  node  that
              will have an sos report collected from it individually before attempting to connect to the nodes.

       <b>--preset</b> PRESET
              Specify a sos preset to use, note that this requires sos-3.6 or later to be installed on the node.
              The given preset must also exist on the remote node - local presets are not used.

              If  <b>--preset</b>  is  specified  and  a  given node either does not have that preset defined, or has a
              version of sos prior to 3.6, this option is ignored for that node.

       <b>-p</b> SSH_PORT, <b>--ssh-port</b> SSH_PORT
              Specify SSH port for all nodes. Use this if SSH runs on any port other than 22.

       <b>--skip-commands</b> COMMANDS
              A comma delimited list of commands to skip execution of, but still allowing the rest of the plugin
              that calls the command to run. This will generally need  to  be  some  form  of  UNIX  shell-style
              wildcard  matching.  For  example,  using  a value of <b>hostname</b> will skip only that single command,
              while using <b>hostname*</b> will skip all commands with names that begin with the string "hostname".

       <b>--skip-files</b> FILES
              A comma delimited list of files or filepath wildcard matches to skip  collection  of.  Values  may
              either be exact filepaths or paths using UNIX shell-style wildcards, for example <b><a href="file:/etc/sos/">/etc/sos/</a>*</b>.

       <b>--ssh-user</b> SSH_USER
              Specify an SSH user for sos collect to connect to nodes with. Default is root.

              sos collect will prompt for a sudo password for non-root users.

       <b>-s</b> SYSROOT, <b>--sysroot</b> SYSROOT
              Report option. Specify an alternate root file system path.

       <b>-t</b> THREADS <b>--threads</b> THREADS
              Report option. Specify the number of collection threads to run.

              The  report  process  on  each  node  will  run  THREADS number of plugins concurrently during the
              collection process.

              Defaults to 4.

       <b>--timeout</b> TIMEOUT
              Timeout for sos report generation on each node, in seconds.

              Note that sos reports are collected in parallel, so you can approximate the total runtime  of  sos
              collect via timeout*(number of nodes/jobs).

              Default is 180 seconds.

       <b>--transport</b> TRANSPORT
              Specify the type of remote transport to use to manage connections to remote nodes.

              <b>sos</b>  <b>collect</b> uses locally installed binaries to connect to and interact with remote nodes, instead
              of directly establishing those  connections.  By  default,  OpenSSH's  ControlPersist  feature  is
              preferred, however certain cluster types may have preferences of their own for how remote sessions
              should be established.

              The types of transports supported are currently as follows:

                  <b>auto</b>                  Allow the cluster type to determine the transport used
                  <b>control_persist</b>       Use OpenSSH's ControlPersist feature. This is the default behavior
                  <b>oc</b>                     Use  a  <b>locally</b>  configured  <b>oc</b> binary to deploy collection pods on OCP
              nodes

       <b>--tmp-dir</b> TMP_DIR
              Specify a temporary directory to save sos archives to. By default one will be created in <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>  and
              then removed after sos collect has finished running.

              This is NOT the same as specifying a temporary directory for sos report on the remote nodes.

       <b>-v</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Print debug information to screen.

       <b>--verify</b>
              Report  option. Passes the "--verify" option to sos report on the nodes which causes sos report to
              validate plugin-specific data during collection.

              Note that this option may considerably extend the time it takes sos report to run  on  the  nodes.
              Consider increasing <b>--timeout</b> when using this option.

       <b>-z</b> COMPRESSION, <b>--compression-type</b> COMPRESSION
              Report option. Override the default compression type.
