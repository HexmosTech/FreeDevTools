</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pw-top - The PipeWire process viewer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pw-top</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pw-top</u> program provides a dynamic real-time view of the pipewire node and device statistics.

       A hierarchical view is shown of Driver nodes and follower nodes. The Driver nodes are actively using a
       timer to schedule dataflow in the followers. The followers of a driver node as shown below their driver
       with a + sign in a tree-like representation.

       The columns presented are as follows:

       <b>S</b>
           Node status.

           • E = ERROR

           • C = CREATING

           • S = SUSPENDED

           • I = IDLE

           • R = RUNNING

           • t = RUNNING + transport starting

           • T = RUNNING + transport running

       <b>ID</b>
           The ID of the pipewire node/device, as found in <u>pw-dump</u> and <u>pw-cli</u>

       <b>QUANT</b>
           The current quantum (for drivers) and the suggested quantum for follower nodes.

           The  quantum  by  itself  needs  to  be  divided  by  the  RATE column to calculate the duration of a
           scheduling period in fractions of a second.

           For a QUANT of 1024 and a RATE of 48000, the duration of one period in the  graph  is  1024/48000  or
           21.3 milliseconds.

           Follower nodes can have a 0 QUANT field, which means that the node does not have a suggestion for the
           quantum and thus uses what the driver selected.

           The  driver  will  use  the lowest quantum of any of the followers. If none of the followers select a
           quantum, the default quantum in the pipewire configuration file will be used.

           The QUANT on the drivers usually translates directly into the number of audio samples  processed  per
           processing cycle of the graph.

       <b>RATE</b>
           The current rate (for drivers) and the suggested rate for follower nodes.

           This  is  the rate at which the <u>graph</u> processes data and needs to be combined with the QUANT value to
           derive the duration of a processing cycle in the graph.

           Some nodes can have a 0 RATE, which means that they don\'t have any rate suggestion  for  the  graph.
           Nodes  that suggest a rate can make the graph switch rates if the graph is otherwise idle and the new
           rate is allowed as a possible graph rate (see the pipewire configuration file).

           The RATE on (audio) driver nodes usually also translates directly  to  the  samplerate  used  by  the
           device.  Although  some  devices  might not be able to operate at the given samplerate, in which case
           resampling will need to be done. The negotiated samplerate with the device and stream can be found in
           the FORMAT column.

       <b>WAIT</b>
           The waiting time of a node is the elapsed time between when the node is ready to start processing and
           when it actually started processing.

           For Driver nodes, this is the time between when the node wakes up to start processing the  graph  and
           when  the  driver  (and  thus also the graph) completes a cycle. The WAIT time for driver is thus the
           elapsed time processing the graph.

           For follower nodes, it is the time spent between being woken up (when all dependencies  of  the  node
           are  satisfied) and when processing starts. The WAIT time for follower nodes is thus mostly caused by
           context switching.

           A value of --- means that the node was not signaled. A value of +++ means that the node was  signaled
           but not awake.

       <b>BUSY</b>
           The  processing  time  is started when the node starts processing until it completes and wakes up the
           next nodes in the graph.

           A value of --- means that the node was not started. A value of +++ means that the  node  was  started
           but did not complete.

       <b>W/Q</b>
           Ratio of WAIT / QUANT.

           The  W/Q  time  of  the  driver node is a good measure of the graph load. The running averages of the
           driver W/Q ratios are used as the DSP load in other (JACK) tools.

           Values of --- and +++ are copied from the WAIT column.

       <b>B/Q</b>
           Ratio of BUSY / QUANT

           This is a good measure of the load of a particular driver or follower node.

           Values of --- and +++ are copied from the BUSY column.

       <b>ERR</b>
           Total of Xruns and Errors

           Xruns for drivers are when the graph did not complete a cycle. This can be  because  a  node  in  the
           graph  also  has an Xrun. It can also be caused when scheduling delays cause a deadline to be missed,
           causing a hardware Xrun.

           Xruns for followers are incremented when the node started processing but did not complete before  the
           end of the graph cycle deadline.

       <b>FORMAT</b>
           The  format  used  by  the driver node or the stream. This is the hardware format negotiated with the
           device or stream.

           If the stream of driver has a different rate than the graph, resampling will be done.

           For raw audio formats, the layout is &lt;sampleformat&gt; &lt;channels&gt; &lt;samplerate&gt;.

           For IEC958 passthrough audio formats, the layout is IEC958 &lt;codec&gt; &lt;samplerate&gt;.

           For DSD formats, the layout is &lt;dsd-rate&gt; &lt;channels&gt;.

           For Video formats, the layout is &lt;pixelformat&gt; &lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;.

       <b>NAME</b>
           Name assigned to the device/node, as found in <u>pw-dump</u> node.name

           Names are prefixed by <u>+</u> when they are linked to a driver (entry above with no +)
