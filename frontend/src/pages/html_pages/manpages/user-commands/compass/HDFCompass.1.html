       hdfcompass - HDF Compass Documentation

       This document provide information about the HDF Compass application.

</pre><h4><b>IN</b> <b>BRIEF</b></h4><pre>
       HDF  Compass is an experimental viewer program for HDF5 and related formats, designed to complement other
       more complex applications like HDFView.  Strong emphasis is placed on clean minimal design,  and  maximum
       extensibility through a plugin system for new formats.

       HDF Compass is written in Python, but ships as a native application on Windows, OS X, and Linux, by using
       PyInstaller and Py2App to package the app.

   <b>Data</b> <b>Model</b> <u><b>[developer]</b></u>
   <b>Introduction</b>
       This  document  describes  the  publically  accessible  data model package which is used by HDFCompass to
       display objects in a file, OpenDAP server or other resource.

       The data model is implemented as a collection of classes in a top-level  Python  package,  <b>compass_model</b>,
       which  is  completely  independent  of  the  GUI code.  It has no dependencies beyond the Python standard
       library.  This makes it possible to develop and test new plugins independently  of  GUI  development;  in
       particular,  the  automated  Python unit-testing framework can be used, which is impossible for code that
       depends on the GUI.

       The classes in <b>compass_model</b> are abstract, and define a standard interface for objects  like  containers,
       regular   multidimensional  arrays,  images,  and  key/value  stores.   "Plug-ins"  consist  of  concrete
       implementations which satisfy this interface.  For example, the built-in HDF5  plugin  which  ships  with
       HDFCompass  implements  a  <b>Group</b>  class  which inherits from <b>compass_model.Container</b>, and a Dataset class
       which inherits from <b>compass_model.Array</b>.

       The GUI has a collection of viewers which can display any object  following  the  interfaces  defined  in
       <b>compass_model</b>.   For  example,  <b>compass_model.Container</b>  implementations are displayed in a browser-style
       view, with list, icon, and tree displays possible.   Likewise,  <b>compass_model.Array</b>  implementations  are
       displayed in a spreadsheet-like view, with facilities for plotting data.

       Multiple  concrete  classes  can  handle  the  same  object  in  a  file.   For example, an HDF5 image is
       implemented as a dataset with special attributes.  Three classes  in  the  HDF5  plugin  are  capable  of
       handling  such  an  object, which inherit respectively from <b>compass_model.Image</b>, <b>compass_model.Array</b>, and
       <b>compass_model.KeyValue</b>; the last represents HDF5 attributes.

       When an icon in the GUI is double-clicked, the default (last-registered) class is used to open to  object
       in  the  file.  The other classes are made available in a context menu, for example, if the user wants to
       open an image with the Array viewer or see the HDF5 attributes.

       Numeric types (integers, floats, multidimensional data) are handled with the NumPy type model, which  can
       represent nearly all formats.  Python strings (byte and Unicode) are also supported.

   <b>Data</b> <b>stores</b>
       <b>class</b> <b>Store</b>
              Represents  a  file  or  remote  resource which contains objects.  Objects within the store can be
              retrieved using <u>keys</u>, which may be any  hashable  Python  object.   For  example,  an  HDF5  store
              generally  uses  string  keys representing paths in the file, although object and region reference
              objects are also valid.

              Objects may be retrieved using the __getitem__ syntax (<b>obj</b> <b>=</b> <b>store[key]</b>).  The retrieved object is
              a Node instance.  The exact class depends on the order in which Node handlers were registered; see
              the <u>push</u> method below.

   <b>Methods</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plugin</b> <b>system</b>
       Typically, a model will implement several classes based on the <b>compass_model</b>  abstract  classes  such  as
       <b>Container</b>  or  <b>Array</b>.   This rasises the question: when an object is retrieved from the data store, which
       class should be used?

       The answer is that each <b>Node</b> subclass you write should be "registered" with your <b>Store</b> subclass, and have
       a static method called <b>canhandle</b>.  When an object is opened, by  default  the  most  recently  registered
       class which reports it can understand the object is used.

       All registered subclasses may be retrieved via the <b>gethandlers</b> function, which an optionally request that
       only  subclasses  capable  of  handling <u>key</u> be returned.  This is the basis for the right-click "Open As"
       menu in the GUI.

       <b>classmethod</b> <b>Store.push(nodeclass)</b>
              Register a Node subclass.  These are kept in a list inside the class; when an object is  retrieved
              from  the  store,  the  first  class  for  which  <u>nodeclass.canhandle(store,</u>  <u>key)</u> returns True is
              instantiated and returned.

       <b>Store.__getitem__(key)</b>
              Open an object in the store, using the last registered class which reports it can open the key.

       <b>Store.gethandlers(key=None)</b>
              Retrieve all registered Node subclasses, optionally filtering  by  those  which  report  they  can
              handle <u>key</u>.

       <b>Store.__contains__(key)</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b> True if <u>key</u> is exists in the store, False otherwise.

   <b>Other</b> <b>methods</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>properties</b>
       <b>static</b> <b>Store.canhandle(url)</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b>  Return True if this class can make sense of <u>url</u>, False otherwise.  This method is used
              by the GUI when determining which Store implementation to use when opening a file.   For  example,
              the HDF5 plugin uses <b>h5py.is_hdf5(filename)</b>.

       <b>Store.__init__(url)</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b>  Create  a  new  store  instance  from  the  data  at  <u>url</u>.   URLs  are  given  in  the
              <b>scheme://locator</b>   fashion.    For   example,   an    HDF5    file    might    be    located    by
              <b>file:///path/to/file.hdf5</b>.

       <b>Store.close():</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b> Discontinue access to the data store.

       <b>Store.get_parent(key)</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b> Return the object which contains <u>key</u>, or None if no such object exists.

       <b>Store.url</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b> The URL used to open the store

       <b>Store.displayname</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b> A short name used for the store (e.g. <b>basename(filepath)</b>).

       <b>Store.root</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b> A Node instance representing the starting point in the file.  For hierarchical formats,
              this  would  be the root container.  For scalar formats (FITS, for example), this could be e.g. an
              Array or Image instance.

       <b>Store.file_extensions</b>
              For plugins that support local file access, this is a dictionary mapping file kinds  to  lists  of
              extensions in "glob" format, e.g.  <b>{'HDF5</b> <b>File':</b> <b>['.h5',</b> <b>'.hdf5']}</b>.  This will be used to populate
              the filter in the file-open dialog, among other things.

   <b>Nodes</b>
       A "node" is any object which lives in the data store.  The Node class defined below is the base class for
       more interesting abstract classes like containers and arrays.  It defines much of the interface.

       <b>class</b> <b>Node</b>
              Base class for all objects which live in a data store.

              You  generally  shouldn't  inherit  from  Node  directly,  but  from  one  of the more useful Node
              subclasses in this file.  Direct Node subclasses can't do anything interesting  in  the  GUI;  all
              they do is show up in the browser.

       <b>Node.icons</b>
              Class  attribute  containing  a  dict for icon support.  Keys should be integers giving icon size;
              values are a callable returning a byte string with PNG image data.   Example:       <b>icons</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>{16:</b>
              <b>get_png_16,</b>  <b>32:</b>  <b>get_png_32}</b>.   Since  icons  are a pain to handle, default icons are provided by
              <b>compass_model</b> and this attribute is optional.

       <b>Node.classkind</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b> A short string (2 or 3 words) describing what the class represents.  This will show  up
              in e.g. the "Open As" context menu.  Example:  "HDF5 Image" or "Swath".

       <b>static</b> <b>Node.canhandle(store,</b> <b>key)</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b> Determine whether this class can usefully represent the object.  Keep in mind that keys
              are not technically required to be strings.

       <b>Node.__init__(store,</b> <b>key):</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b> Create a new instance representing the object pointed to by <u>key</u> in <u>store</u>.

       <b>Node.key</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b> Unique key which identifies this object in the store.  Keys may be any hashable object,
              although strings are the most common.

       <b>Node.store</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b> The data store to which the object belongs.

       <b>Node.displayname</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b> A short name for display purposes (16 chars or so; more will be ellipsized).

       <b>Node.description</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b> Descriptive string (possibly multi-line).

   <b>Containers</b>
       <b>class</b> <b>Container(Node)</b>
              Represents  an  object  which  holds  other objects, like an HDF5 group or a filesystem directory.
              Implementations will be displayed using the browser view.

       <b>Container.__len__()</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b> Get the number of objects directly attached to the container.

       <b>Container.__getitem__(index)</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b> Retrieve the node at <u>index</u>.  Note this returns a Node instance, not a key.

   <b>Arrays</b>
       <b>class</b> <b>Array(Node)</b>
              The array type represents a multidimensional array, using an interface inspired by Numpy arrays.

              Implementations will be displayed in a spreadsheet-style viewer with controls for  subsetting  and
              plotting.

       <b>Array.shape</b>
              Shape of the array, as a Python tuple.

       <b>Array.dtype</b>
              NumPy data type object representing the type of the array.

       <b>Array.__getitem__(indices)</b>
              Retrieve  data  from  the  array, using the standard array-slicing syntax <b>data</b> <b>=</b> <b>array[idx1,</b> <b>idx2,</b>
              <b>idx3]</b>.  <u>indices</u> are the slicing arguments.  Only integer indexes and slice  objects  (representing
              ranges) are supported.

   <b>Key-Value</b> <b>lists</b>
       <b>class</b> <b>KeyValue(Node)</b>
              Represents  an  object  which contains a sequence of key: value attributes.  Keys must be strings.
              Values may be Python or NumPy objects.   Implementations  will  be  displayed  using  a  list-like
              control.

       <b>KeyValue.keys</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b> A list containing all (string) keys contained in the object.

       <b>KeyValue.__getitem__(name)</b>
              <b>(Abstract)</b> Retrieve the value associated with string <u>name</u>.

   <b>Images</b>
       <b>class</b> <b>Image(Node)</b>
              Represents an image.  The current interface supports only true-color RGB images with the origin at
              upper  left,  although  this  could  easily  be extended to more complex formats including RGBA or
              palette-based images.

              Implementations are displayed in an image viewer.

       <b>Image.width</b>
              Image width in pixels

       <b>Image.height</b>
              Image height in pixels

       <b>Image.data</b>
              Image data.  Currently RGB, pixel-interlaced.

   <b>Top-level</b> <b>functions</b>
       One public function is defined in <b>compass_model</b>:

       <b>push(storeclass)</b>
              Register a new Store subclass with HDFCompass.  When a URL is being  opened,  the  class  will  be
              queried (via <b>storeclass.canhandle</b>) to see if it can make sense of the URL.

       • hdf_compass/utils/__init__.py

   <b>PyInstaller</b>
       For  the  <u>HDFCompass.1file.spec</u>  file, you need to verify that the following parameters are passed to the
       <b>EXE()</b> function:

       • <b>console=False</b>: to avoid that a console window is opened at run-time for standard I/O

       • <b>debug=False</b>: to avoid that the boot-loader issues progress messages while initializing and starting the
         bundled app

   <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>freeze</b> <u><b>[developer]</b></u>
       TBD
