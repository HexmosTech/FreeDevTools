</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       llvm-ar - LLVM archiver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>llvm-ar</b> [-]{dmpqrstx}[abcDilLNoOPsSTuUvV] [relpos] [count] archive [files…]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>llvm-ar</b> command is similar to the common Unix utility, <b>ar</b>. It archives several files, such as objects
       and  LLVM  bitcode  files  into  a single archive library that can be linked into a program. However, the
       archive can contain any kind of file. By default, <b>llvm-ar</b> generates a symbol  table  that  makes  linking
       faster  because  only  the  symbol  table  needs  to be consulted, not each individual file member of the
       archive.

       The <b>llvm-ar</b> command can be used to <u>read</u> archive files in SVR4, GNU, BSD , Big Archive, and Darwin format,
       and <u>write</u> in the GNU, BSD, Big Archive, and Darwin style archive files. If an SVR4 format archive is used
       with the <u>r</u> (replace), <u>d</u> (delete),  <u>m</u>  (move)  or  <u>q</u>  (quick  update)  operations,  the  archive  will  be
       reconstructed in the format defined by <u>--format</u>.

       Here’s where <b>llvm-ar</b> departs from previous <b>ar</b> implementations:

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>option</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>supported</u>
          [f] - truncate inserted filenames

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>options</u> <u>are</u> <u>ignored</u> <u>for</u> <u>compatibility</u>
          –plugin=&lt;string&gt; - load a plugin which adds support for other file formats

          [l] - ignored in <b>ar</b>

       <u>Symbol</u> <u>Table</u>
          Since  <b>llvm-ar</b>  supports  bitcode  files, the symbol table it creates includes both native and bitcode
          symbols.

       <u>Deterministic</u> <u>Archives</u>
          By default, <b>llvm-ar</b> always uses zero for timestamps and UIDs/GIDs to write archives in a deterministic
          mode. This is equivalent to the <u>D</u>  modifier  being  enabled  by  default.  If  you  wish  to  maintain
          compatibility  with  other  <b>ar</b> implementations, you can pass the <u>U</u> modifier to write actual timestamps
          and UIDs/GIDs.

       <u>Windows</u> <u>Paths</u>
          When on Windows <b>llvm-ar</b> treats the names of archived <u>files</u> in the same case sensitive  manner  as  the
          operating system. When on a non-Windows machine <b>llvm-ar</b> does not consider character case.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>llvm-ar</b>  operations  are compatible with other <b>ar</b> implementations. However, there are a few modifiers (<u>L</u>)
       that are not found in other <b>ar</b> implementations. The options for <b>llvm-ar</b> specify a single basic  Operation
       to  perform  on the archive, a variety of Modifiers for that Operation, the name of the archive file, and
       an optional list of file names. If the <u>files</u> option is not specified, it generally means either “none” or
       “all” members, depending on the operation. The Options, Operations and Modifiers  are  explained  in  the
       sections below.

       The minimal set of options is at least one operator and the name of the archive.

   <b>Operations</b>
       <b>d</b> <b>[NT]</b> Delete  files  from  the <b>archive</b>. The <u>N</u> and <u>T</u> modifiers apply to this operation. The <u>files</u> options
              specify which members should be removed from the archive. It is not an error if a  specified  file
              does not appear in the archive. If no <u>files</u> are specified, the archive is not modified.

       <b>m</b> <b>[abi]</b>
              Move  files  from  one location in the <b>archive</b> to another. The <u>a</u>, <u>b</u>, and <u>i</u> modifiers apply to this
              operation. The <u>files</u> will all be moved to the location given by the modifiers. If no modifiers are
              used, the files will be moved to the end of the archive. If no <u>files</u> are specified, the archive is
              not modified.

       <b>p</b> <b>[v]</b>  Print <u>files</u> to the standard output stream. If no  <u>files</u>  are  specified,  the  entire  <b>archive</b>  is
              printed.  With the <u>v</u> modifier, <b>llvm-ar</b> also prints out the name of the file being output. Printing
              binary files is  ill-advised as they might confuse your terminal settings. The <u>p</u>  operation  never
              modifies the archive.

       <b>q</b> <b>[LT]</b> Quickly  append  files  to  the  end  of  the <b>archive</b> without removing duplicates. If no <u>files</u> are
              specified, the archive is not modified. The behavior when appending one archive to another depends
              upon whether the <u>L</u> and <u>T</u> modifiers are used:

              • Appending a regular archive to a regular archive will append the archive file. If the <u>L</u> modifier
                is specified the members will be appended instead.

              • Appending a regular archive to a thin archive requires  the  <u>T</u>  modifier  and  will  append  the
                archive file. The <u>L</u> modifier is not supported.

              • Appending  a  thin archive to a regular archive will append the archive file.  If the <u>L</u> modifier
                is specified the members will be appended instead.

              • Appending a thin archive to a thin archive will always quick append its members.

       <b>r</b> <b>[abTu]</b>
              Replace existing <u>files</u> or insert them at the end of the <b>archive</b> if they do not exist. The <u>a</u>, <u>b</u>,  <u>T</u>
              and <u>u</u> modifiers apply to this operation. If no <u>files</u> are specified, the archive is not modified.

       t[v] .. option:: t [vO]
          Print  the  table  of  contents.  Without  any  modifiers, this operation just prints the names of the
          members to the standard output stream. With the <u>v</u> modifier, <b>llvm-ar</b> also  prints  out  the  file  type
          (B=bitcode, S=symbol table, blank=regular file), the permission mode, the owner and group, are ignored
          when  extracting  <u>files</u>  and  set  to  placeholder  values  when adding size, and the date. With the <u>O</u>
          modifier, display member offsets. If any <u>files</u> are specified, the listing is only for those files.  If
          no <u>files</u> are specified, the table of contents for the whole archive is printed.

       <b>V</b>      A synonym for the <u>--version</u> option.

       <b>x</b> <b>[oP]</b> Extract  <b>archive</b>  members  back to files. The <u>o</u> modifier applies to this operation. This operation
              retrieves the indicated <u>files</u> from the archive and writes them back to the operating system’s file
              system. If no <u>files</u> are specified, the entire archive is extracted.

   <b>Modifiers</b> <b>(operation</b> <b>specific)</b>
       The modifiers below are specific to certain operations. See the Operations  section  to  determine  which
       modifiers are applicable to which operations.

       <b>a</b>      When  inserting  or moving member files, this option specifies the destination of the new files as
              being after the <u>relpos</u> member. If <u>relpos</u> is not found, the files are placed  at  the  end  of  the
              <b>archive</b>. <u>relpos</u> cannot be consumed without either <u>a</u>, <u>b</u> or <u>i</u>.

       <b>b</b>      When  inserting  or moving member files, this option specifies the destination of the new files as
              being before the <u>relpos</u> member. If <u>relpos</u> is not found, the files are placed at  the  end  of  the
              <b>archive</b>.  <u>relpos</u>  cannot be consumed without either <u>a</u>, <u>b</u> or <u>i</u>. This modifier is identical to the <u>i</u>
              modifier.

       <b>i</b>      A synonym for the <u>b</u> option.

       <b>L</b>      When quick appending an <b>archive</b>, instead quick append its members. This is a feature  for  <b>llvm-ar</b>
              that is not found in gnu-ar.

       <b>N</b>      When extracting or deleting a member that shares its name with another member, the <u>count</u> parameter
              allows you to supply a positive whole number that selects the instance of the given name, with “1”
              indicating  the  first  instance.  If  <u>N</u>  is  not  specified the first member of that name will be
              selected. If <u>count</u> is not supplied, the operation fails.*count* cannot be

       <b>o</b>      When extracting files, use the modification times of any <u>files</u> as they appear in the  <b>archive</b>.  By
              default <u>files</u> extracted from the archive use the time of extraction.

       <b>O</b>      Display member offsets inside the archive.

       <b>T</b>      Alias  for  <b>--thin</b>.  In  many ar implementations <b>T</b> has a different meaning, as specified by X/Open
              System interface.

       <b>v</b>      When printing <u>files</u> or the <b>archive</b> table of contents, this modifier instructs <b>llvm-ar</b>  to  include
              additional information in the output.

   <b>Modifiers</b> <b>(generic)</b>
       The modifiers below may be applied to any operation.

       <b>c</b>      For  the  <u>r</u> (replace)and <u>q</u> (quick update) operations, <b>llvm-ar</b> will always create the archive if it
              doesn’t exist.  Normally, <b>llvm-ar</b> will print a warning message  indicating  that  the  <b>archive</b>  is
              being created. Using this modifier turns off that warning.

       <b>D</b>      Use zero for timestamps and UIDs/GIDs. This is set by default.

       <b>P</b>      Use full paths when matching member names rather than just the file name.  This can be useful when
              manipulating  an  <b>archive</b> generated by another archiver, as some allow paths as member names. This
              is the default behavior for thin archives.

       <b>s</b>      This modifier requests that an archive index (or symbol table) be added  to  the  <b>archive</b>,  as  if
              using  ranlib.  The  symbol  table  will  contain  all the externally visible functions and global
              variables defined by all the bitcode files in the archive. By  default  <b>llvm-ar</b>  generates  symbol
              tables in archives. This can also be used as an operation.

       <b>S</b>      This  modifier  is  the  opposite  of the <u>s</u> modifier. It instructs <b>llvm-ar</b> to not build the symbol
              table. If both <u>s</u> and <u>S</u> are used, the last modifier to occur in the options will prevail.

       <b>u</b>      Only update <b>archive</b> members with <u>files</u> that have more recent timestamps.

       <b>U</b>      Use actual timestamps and UIDs/GIDs.

   <b>Other</b>
       <b>--format=&lt;type&gt;</b>
              This option allows for default, gnu, darwin or bsd  <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>  to  be  selected.   When  creating  an
              <b>archive</b>, <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> will default to that of the host machine.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print a summary of command-line options and their meanings.

       <b>-M</b>     This  option allows for MRI scripts to be read through the standard input stream. No other options
              are compatible with this option.

       <b>--output=&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Specify a directory where archive members should be extracted to. By default the  current  working
              directory is used.

       <b>--rsp-quoting=&lt;type&gt;</b>

       <b>This</b> <b>option</b> <b>selects</b> <b>the</b> <b>quoting</b> <b>style</b> <b>``&lt;type&gt;``</b> <b>for</b> <b>response</b> <b>files,</b> <b>either</b>

       <b>``posix``</b> <b>or</b> <b>``windows``.</b> <b>The</b> <b>default</b> <b>when</b> <b>on</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>is</b> <b>``windows``,</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>the</b>

       <b>default</b> <b>is</b> <b>``posix``.</b>

       <b>--thin</b> When  creating  or  modifying  an archive, this option specifies that the <b>archive</b> will be thin. By
              default, archives are not created as thin archives and when modifying a thin archive, it  will  be
              converted to a regular archive.

       <b>--version</b>
              Display the version of the <b>llvm-ar</b> executable.

       <b>-X</b> <b>mode</b>
              Specifies the type of object file <b>llvm-ar</b> will recognise. The mode must be one of the following:

                 <b>32</b>     Process only 32-bit object files.

                 <b>64</b>     Process only 64-bit object files.

                 <b>32_64</b>  Process both 32-bit and 64-bit object files.

                 <b>any</b>    Process all object files.

              The  default  is  to process 32-bit object files (ignore 64-bit objects). The mode can also be set
              with the OBJECT_MODE environment variable. For example, OBJECT_MODE=64 causes ar  to  process  any
              64-bit objects and ignore 32-bit objects. The -X flag overrides the OBJECT_MODE variable.

       <b>@&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              Read command-line options and commands from response file <b>&lt;FILE&gt;</b>.

</pre><h4><b>MRI</b> <b>SCRIPTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>llvm-ar</b>  understands a subset of the MRI scripting interface commonly supported by archivers following in
       the ar tradition. An MRI script contains a sequence of commands to be executed by the  archiver.  The  <u>-M</u>
       option allows for an MRI script to be passed to <b>llvm-ar</b> through the standard input stream.

       Note that <b>llvm-ar</b> has known limitations regarding the use of MRI scripts:

       • Each script can only create one archive.

       • Existing archives can not be modified.

   <b>MRI</b> <b>Script</b> <b>Commands</b>
       Each  command  begins  with  the  command’s  name  and  must  appear on its own line.  Some commands have
       arguments, which must be separated from the name by whitespace. An MRI script should begin with either  a
       <u>CREATE</u> or <u>CREATETHIN</u> command and will typically end with a <u>SAVE</u> command. Any text after either ‘*’ or ‘;’
       is treated as a comment.

       <b>CREATE</b> <b>archive</b>
              Begin  creation  of  a  regular archive with the specified name. Subsequent commands act upon this
              <b>archive</b>.

       <b>CREATETHIN</b> <b>archive</b>
              Begin creation of a thin archive with the  specified  name.  Subsequent  commands  act  upon  this
              <b>archive</b>.

       <b>ADDLIB</b> <b>archive</b>
              Append the contents of <b>archive</b> to the current archive.

       <b>ADDMOD</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Append <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> to the current archive.

       <b>DELETE</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Delete  the member of the current archive whose file name, excluding directory components, matches
              <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>.

       <b>SAVE</b>   Write the current archive to the path specified in the previous <u>CREATE</u>/<u>CREATETHIN</u> command.

       <b>END</b>    Ends the MRI script (optional).

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       If <b>llvm-ar</b> succeeds, it will exit with 0.  Otherwise, if an error occurs, it will exit  with  a  non-zero
       value.
