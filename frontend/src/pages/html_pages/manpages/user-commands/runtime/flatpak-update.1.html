</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       flatpak-update - Update an application or runtime

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>flatpak</b> <b>update</b> [OPTION...] [REF...]

       <b>flatpak</b> <b>update</b> [OPTION...] --appstream [REMOTE]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Updates applications and runtimes.  REF is a reference to the application or runtime to update. If no REF
       is given, everything is updated, as well as appstream info for all remotes.

       Each REF argument is a full or partial identifier in the flatpak ref format, which looks like
       "(app|runtime)/ID/ARCH/BRANCH". All elements except ID are optional and can be left out, including the
       slashes, so most of the time you need only specify ID. Any part left out will be matched against what is
       installed, and if there are multiple matches an error message will list the alternatives.

       By default this looks for both apps and runtimes with the given REF, but you can limit this by using the
       <b>--app</b> or <b>--runtime</b> option, or by supplying the initial element in the REF.

       Normally, this command updates the application to the tip of its branch. But it is possible to check out
       another commit, with the <b>--commit</b> option.

       If the configured remote for a ref being updated has a collection ID configured on it, Flatpak will
       search the sideload-repos directories configured either with the <b>--sideload-repo</b> option, or on a
       per-installation or system-wide basis (see <b><a href="../man1/flatpak.1.html">flatpak</a></b>(1)).

       Note that updating a runtime is different from installing a different branch, and runtime updates are
       expected to keep strict compatibility. If an application update does cause a problem, it is possible to
       go back to the previous version, with the <b>--commit</b> option.

       In addition to updates, this command will offer to uninstall any unused end-of-life runtimes. Runtimes
       that were explicitly installed (not as a dependency) or explicitly pinned (see <b><a href="../man1/flatpak-pin.1.html">flatpak-pin</a></b>(1)) are left
       installed even if unused and end-of-life.

       Unless overridden with the <b>--user</b>, <b>--system</b> or <b>--installation</b> option, this command updates any matching
       refs in the standard system-wide installation and the per-user one.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>
           Update a per-user installation.

       <b>--system</b>
           Update the default system-wide installation.

       <b>--installation=NAME</b>
           Updates a system-wide installation specified by NAME among those defined in
           /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using <b>--installation=default</b> is equivalent to using <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--arch=ARCH</b>
           The architecture to update for. See <b>flatpak</b> <b>--supported-arches</b> for architectures supported by the
           host.

       <b>--subpath=PATH</b>
           Install only a subpath of the ref. This is mainly used to install a subset of locales. This can be
           added multiple times to install multiple subpaths. If this is not specified the subpaths specified at
           install time are reused.

       <b>--commit=COMMIT</b>
           Update to this commit, instead of the tip of the branch. You can find commits using <b>flatpak</b>
           <b>remote-info</b> <b>--log</b> <b>REMOTE</b> <b>REF</b>.

       <b>--no-deploy</b>
           Download the latest version, but don't deploy it.

       <b>--no-pull</b>
           Don't download the latest version, deploy whatever is locally available.

       <b>--no-related</b>
           Don't download related extensions, such as the locale data.

       <b>--no-deps</b>
           Don't update or install runtime dependencies when installing.

       <b>--app</b>
           Only look for an app with the given name.

       <b>--appstream</b>
           Update appstream for REMOTE, or all remotes if no remote is specified.

       <b>--runtime</b>
           Only look for a runtime with the given name.

       <b>--sideload-repo=PATH</b>
           Adds an extra local ostree repo as a source for installation. This is equivalent to using the
           sideload-repos directories (see <b><a href="../man1/flatpak.1.html">flatpak</a></b>(1)), but can be done on a per-command basis. Any path added
           here is used in addition to ones in those directories.

       <b>-y</b>, <b>--assumeyes</b>
           Automatically answer yes to all questions (or pick the most prioritized answer). This is useful for
           automation.

       <b>--noninteractive</b>
           Produce minimal output and avoid most questions. This is suitable for use in non-interactive
           situations, e.g. in a build script.

       <b>--force-remove</b>
           Remove old files even if they're in use by a running application.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print debug information during command processing.

       <b>--ostree-verbose</b>
           Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
