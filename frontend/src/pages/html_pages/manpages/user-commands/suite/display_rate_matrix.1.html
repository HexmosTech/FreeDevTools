       display_rate_matrix - this tool is part of the PHAST suite

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-t</b> &lt;t&gt;: Output P(t) = exp(Qt) instead of Q.
              Requires t &gt;= 0.

              Use "-t A" to output a matrix for each branch of the tree.

       <b>-f</b>:    Show  equilibrium  frequencies as an additional table row.  In list node they are shown with first
              tuple being -.

       <b>-e</b>:    Show "exchangeabilities" instead of raw matrix elements (that  is,  divide  each  element  by  the
              equilibrium frequency of its column).  Not available with <b>-t</b>.

       <b>-d</b>:    Suppress printing of elements on main diagonal.

       <b>-L</b>:    Format table for typesetting with LATEX.  Incompatible with <b>-l</b>.

       <b>-l</b>:    Show  matrix  elements  as  a  list rather than as a table.  When <b>-t</b> is not specified (rate matrix
              case), only off-diagonal elements will be printed.

       <b>-i</b>:    (For use with <b>-l</b> only) Report whether each substitution is a transition or a transversion.

       <b>-z</b>:    (For use with <b>-l</b>) Report elements equal to zero (omitted by default, except with <b>-t</b>).  Implied  by
              <b>-a</b>.

       <b>-S</b>:    (For use with <b>-l</b>)  Assume a symmetric matrix and report half as many lines.  Useful with <b>-e</b>.

       <b>-E</b>:    (for use with <b>-l</b>) Print rates and probabilities in scientific notation (format %e instead of %f).

       <b>-a</b>:    (Requires  a  model  of  order  3).  Replace a matrix of codon substitution rates with the induced
              matrix of amino acid substitution rates, according to  the  universal  genetic  code.   See  Yang,
              Nielsen, and Hasegawa, 1998.

       <b>-s</b>:    (For use with <b>-a</b>)  Include stop codons (by default suppressed).

       <b>-M</b> &lt;f&gt;: (For use with <b>-l</b> only; implies <b>-a</b>) Read an amino-acid

              substitution  matrix  from file &lt;f&gt; and report values from this matrix with the induced amino acid
              substitution rates.  Matrix should be in the format used by BLAST (as produced by the  NCBI  "pam"
              program)

       <b>-N</b> &lt;f&gt;
              Like  <b>-M</b>  but  for matrices in the format used by the PAML package for amino acid substitution and
              rate matrices.

       <b>-A</b> &lt;f&gt;: (For use with <b>-l</b> only and not with <b>-M</b>/-N)
              Read alternative

              substitution scores from file &lt;f&gt; and report  values  in  output.   File  &lt;f&gt;  should  have  three
              columns:  a "from" tuple, a "to" tuple, and a real-valued score.  Substitutions not listed will be
              given null scores and reported as "NA".

       <b>-B</b> &lt;f&gt; Like <b>-A</b> but compares to rates of a single-nucleotide model  (order  1).   File  &lt;f&gt;  should  be  a
              standard tree model (.mod) file.

       <b>-C</b>     Report  context-dependent  transition/transversion  rates, as shown in Tables 2 and 3 of Morton et
              al., JME 45:227-231, 1997.  Requires a model of order 3 with a DNA alphabet.

       <b>-h</b>     Print this help message.
