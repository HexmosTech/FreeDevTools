</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       plc  -  Qualcomm  Atheros  Powerline  Toolkit:  tools  to manage and control HomePlug 1.0 and HomePlug AV
       devices

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       A summary of Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit commands.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>HomePlug</b> <b>1.0</b> and <b>HomePlug</b> <b>AV</b> are industry standard  protocols  for  powerline  communications.   Qualcomm
       Atheros  manufactures  a  family  of  chipsets that conform to these standards and have various USB, PCI,
       Ethernet, MII, SPI and UART host interfaces.

       The <b>HomePlug</b> <b>1.0</b> protocol is based on IEEE-802.3, has ethertype 0x887B and uses special message formats.

       The <b>HomePlug</b> <b>AV</b> protocol is based on IEEE-802.3, has ethertype 0x88E1 and  special  message  formats.   A
       subset  of  those message formats are left unspecified so that chipset vendors can define message formats
       for their own products.  QCA vendor  specific  management  message  formats  are  described  in  the  QCA
       HomePlugAV Firmware Technical Reference Manual.  This toolkit uses these messages to communicate with QCA
       powerline  devices.   Customers  may  use the toolkit to send these messages, explore device behavior and
       develop their own applications.

       Each program in the toolkit deals with a narrow aspect of QCA powerline device management but they can be
       called from shell scripts to perform complex tasks.  With them, one can  identify  chipset  hardware  and
       firmware  version,  reset  devices, flash devices, identify other QCA network devices, validate *.pib and
       *.nvm files, sniff HomePlug AV Ethernet frames, send generic Ethernet frames and so on.

       The source code is designed to demonstrate and educate and may be modified without obligation to Qualcomm
       Atheros.  The QCA Application Engineering Team would appreciate feedback concerning changes that  improve
       the  usability,  reliability  or  efficiency.  Keep in mind that these tools are supposed to be small and
       simple.

</pre><h4><b>TOOLS</b></h4><pre>
       There are  many  independent  programs  in  this  package.   Significant  ones  are  listed  below.   See
       <b>html/overview.html</b> for more information about the Atheros Powerline Toolkit.

       <b>ampboot</b>
              A  command line utility to start, and optionally flash, newer Atheros Powerline Devices.  It is an
              alternative to program <b>int6kboot</b> that may have additional options specific to the <b>AR7400</b>.

       <b>amphost</b>
              A example embedded host emulator that responds to VS_HST_ACTION messages sent  from  a  flash-less
              device  to  a  local  host  processor.   It  can  be used to investigate and verify device-to-host
              interaction.  The  Atheros  embedded  API  can  perform  similar  functionality  in  a  production
              environment.

       <b>ampsnif</b>
              A command line utility to enable or disable sniffer mode on an Atheros Powerline Device.

       <b>amptest</b>
              A  command  line utility to download and execute a sequence of test applets to the local powerline
              device.  It is not for general use because there are  no  interlocks  to  prevent  loading  images
              designed  for  other platforms or loading images in illogical order.  It is an alternative to, and
              replacement for, program <b>int6ktest</b>.

       <b>amptool</b>
              A basic device manager used to inspect and control Atheros  powerline  devices  connected  to  the
              local host.  It is similar to <b>int6k</b> but is specific to the <b>AR7400</b> chipsets.

       <b>ampwait</b>
              A  command line utility used to pause shell scripts at critical points where a device must be in a
              known state before proceeding.  Typical cases involve waiting for device power off or reset, power
              on or restart and network device association.

       <b>ar8236mdioblock</b>
              Produce an MDIO block from Atheros AR8236 special register instructions.  The output  is  suitable

       <b>chknvm</b> A  command  line  utility that validates NVM files based on internal header information, filesize,
              checksums and other general characteristics.  Optionally, it can be  used  to  display  all  image
              headers within an NVM file or the firmware revision contained in the file.

       <b>chkpib</b> A  command  line  utility that validates PIB files based on internal header information, filesize,
              checksum, and other general characteristics.  It can also be used to produce a text catalog of PIB
              files contained in a directory.

              hexadecimal  byte  codes  having  optional  comments and whitespace.  Comments and white space are
              stripped from the input file and the hexadecimal byte codes are transmitted as Ethernet frames.

       <b>ethcat</b> Send on or more files to a remote UART-enabled powerline device using IEEE 802.2 Ethernet  frames.
              Transmitted  frames are assembled into a serial data stream and forwarded to the local host by the
              remote device.

       <b>fp</b>     A command line utility that prints the SHA256 digest for one or more files based on their content.
              Output can be used to compare files or identify files based solely on their  content  despite  any
              filename changes.

       <b>getpib</b> A  command line utility for extracting data from a valid PIB file based on data offset, length and
              format.  It is a companion to program <b>setpib</b>.   Both  programs  are  intended  for  use  in  shell
              scripts.  Users must have some knowledge about the data they are extracting.

       <b>hpav</b>   An  basic  packet sniffer that displays incoming HomePlug AV protocol frames addressed to the host
              as they arrive.  The program may be run in the background as a daemon.

              is similar to <b>hpavkeys</b>  but converts a limited number of pass phrases at one time.

       <b>hpavkeys</b>
              A HomePlug AV key generator.  This program is similar to <b>hpavkey</b> but converts large number of pass
              phrases, read from stdin, and converts them to either DAKs, NMKs or NIDs.

       <b>int6k</b>  A  basic device manager used to inspect and control Atheros INT6x00 devices connected to the local
              host.  It is similar to <b>amptool</b> and <b>plctool</b> but is implemented for <b>INT6000</b>,  <b>INT6300</b>  and  <b>INT6400</b>

              memory or corrupted memory.  It interacts with the Atheros  BootLoader  to  configure  SDRAM  then
              download  runtime  firmware  and  PIB  and start firmware execution.  It can also be used to <b>force</b>
              <b>flash</b> blank or corrupted flash memory.

              configuration, runtime firmware and PIB.  It can also be used to <b>force</b> <b>flash</b>  blank  or  corrupted
              flash memory.

              A  example  embedded  host emulator that responds to VS_HST_ACTION messages sent from a flash-less
              device to a local host processor.  It  can  be  used  to  investigate  and  verify  device-to-host
              interaction.   The  Atheros  embedded  API  can  perform  similar  functionality  in  a production
              environment.

       <b>int6khost64</b>

              A  command  line  utility  to download and execute a series of test applets to the local powerline
              device.  It is not for general use because there are  no  interlocks  to  prevent  loading  images
