</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tkremind - graphical front-end to Remind calendar program

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tkremind</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>read_file</u> [<u>write_file</u> [<u>config_file</u>]]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>TkRemind</b>  is  a  graphical  front-end  to the <b>Remind</b> program.  It provides a friendly graphical interface
       which allows you to view your calendar and add reminders without learning the syntax of <b>Remind</b>.  Although
       not all of <b>Remind</b>'s features are available with <b>TkRemind</b>, <b>TkRemind</b> gives you an opportunity to  edit  the
       reminder commands which it creates.  This allows you to learn <b>Remind</b>'s syntax and then add extra features
       as you become a more sophisticated <b>Remind</b> programmer.

       <b>TkRemind</b>  is  written  in  Tcl, and requires version 8.5 (or higher) as well as the tcllib extension.  It
       also requires a <b>wish</b> binary.  If you are using Tcl/Tk 8.5, you may also need either the Img or the  tkpng
       extension to handle PNG images.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>TkRemind</b>  itself  has  no  command-line  options.   However, it passes certain options on to <b>Remind</b>.  The
       options it passes are <b>-b</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>-x</b>, <b>-i</b> and <b>-m</b>.  See the <b>Remind</b> man page  for  details  about  the  options.
       Note that <b>TkRemind</b> will respect the <b>-m</b> and <b>-b1</b> options and adjust its appearance accordingly.

       <u>Read_file</u>  is the file from which <b>TkRemind</b> reads reminders.  It is in standard <b>Remind</b> format.  <u>Write_file</u>
       is the file to which <b>TkRemind</b> writes reminders which you add using the GUI.  If <u>Read_file</u> is omitted,  it
       defaults to <b>$HOME/.reminders</b>.  If <u>Write_file</u> is omitted, it defaults to <u>Read_file</u>.

       You  may  wish  to  have  a  different <u>Write_file</u> from <u>Read_file</u> if you want to collect all of <b>TkRemind</b>'s
       reminders in one place.  Suppose your main file is <u>$HOME/.reminders</u> and you  want  <b>TkRemind</b>  to  put  its
       reminders in <u>$HOME/.tkreminders</u>.  In <u>$HOME/.reminders</u>, include the line:

            INCLUDE [getenv("HOME")]/.tkreminders

       <u>Config_file</u>  is  the  file  in  which  <b>TkRemind</b>  stores  its  options.   If it is omitted, it defaults to
       <u>$HOME/.config/tkremindrc</u>.

       If <b>$HOME/.reminders</b> is a <u>directory</u>, then <b>TkRemind</b> defaults to reading <b>$HOME/.reminders</b>  and  writing  new
       reminders  to  <b>$HOME/.reminders/100-tkremind.rem</b>.   If  you  want  to  keep your reminders in a directory
       <b>$HOME/.reminders</b>, you should create that directory before starting <b>TkRemind</b>.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>CALENDAR</b> <b>WINDOW</b></h4><pre>
       When you start <b>TkRemind</b>, it displays a calendar for the current month,  with  today's  date  highlighted.
       Reminders  are filled into each box on the calendar.  If a box contains many reminders, you can scroll it
       up and down by dragging mouse button 2 in the box.  Note that there is no specific indication of an over-
       full box; you'll just have to notice that the box appears completely full.

</pre><h4><b>NAVIGATING</b></h4><pre>
       To change to the previous or next month, click the <b>&lt;-</b> or <b>-&gt;</b> button, respectively.  You can also  use  the
       left/right arrow keys or PageUp/PageDown to navigate.

       To change back to the current month, click <b>Today</b> or press the Home key.  To go to a specific month, click
       <b>Go</b>  <b>To</b>  <b>Date...</b>.   This  pops  up a dialog box which allows you to select a month and enter a year.  Once
       you've done this, click <b>Go</b> to go to the date, or <b>Cancel</b> to cancel.

       To exit <b>TkRemind</b>, click <b>Quit</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ADDING</b> <b>REMINDERS</b></h4><pre>
       To add a reminder, click button 1 in any day number in the calendar.  The <b>Add</b> <b>Reminder...</b> dialog will pop
       up, with values preselected for the day you clicked.

       The dialog has six basic groups of controls.  The  first  three  lines  select  one  of  three  types  of
       reminders.   Choose  the  type  of  reminder  with  the radio buttons, and choose the values of the days,
       months, and years by selecting values from pull-down menus.  The pull-down menus appear  when  you  click
       the raised value buttons.

       The  next control specifies an expiry date for the reminder.  Select the check button to enable an expiry
       date, and fill in the values using pull-down menus.

       The third control specifies how much advance notice you want (if any), and whether or  not  weekends  and
       holidays are counted when computing advance notice.

       The  fourth  control  specifies  which days <b>Remind</b> considers as part of the weekend.  This can affect the
       interpretation of "weekday" in the second and third types of reminders.

       The fifth control associates a time with the reminder.  You can also  specify  advance  notice,  possibly
       repeating.

       The sixth control specifies what <b>Remind</b> should do if a reminder falls on a holiday or weekend.

       Enter  the  body  of the reminder into the <b>Summary:</b> text entry.  If you want, you can enter a location, a
       URL, and and longer description in the <b>Location:</b>, <b>URL:</b> and <b>Description:</b> boxes.   If  you  enter  anything
       here, they will be added as <b>INFO</b> items to the reminder.

       To add the reminder to the reminder file, click <b>Add</b> <b>to</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>file</b>.  To close the dialog without adding
       the  reminder  to the file, click <b>Cancel</b>.  To preview the reminder, click <b>Preview</b> <b>reminder</b>.  This pops up
       the <b>Preview</b> <b>reminder</b> dialog box.

</pre><h4><b>PREVIEWING</b> <b>REMINDERS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Preview</b> <b>reminder</b> dialog box is an excellent way to learn <b>Remind</b>.   It  displays  the  <b>Remind</b>  command
       which  realizes  the  reminder  you entered using the <b>Add</b> <b>Reminder...</b> dialog.  You can edit the reminder,
       thereby gaining access to advanced features of <b>Remind</b>.  You can also use it simply  to  play  around  and
       discover <b>Remind</b>'s idioms for expressing different types of reminders.

</pre><h4><b>PRINTING</b></h4><pre>
       To  print  the  current month's calendar, click <b>Print...</b> on the main calendar window.  This brings up the
       print dialog.  Printing either produces a PostScript file or sends PostScript to a UNIX command.  (If you
       have <b>rem2pdf</b> installed, you can choose to produce PDF output rather than PostScript.)

       Select the print destination by choosing either <b>To</b> <b>file:</b> or <b>To</b>  <b>command:</b>  in  the  print  dialog.   Press
       <b>Browse...</b>  to  bring up a file browser.  In the file browser, you can enter a filename in the text entry,
       double-click on a filename in the listbox, or double-click on a directory to navigate  the  file  system.
       You  can  also  type  the  first  few  characters of a file name in the text entry box and press space to
       complete the name to the first matching entry.

       The <b>Match:</b> box contains a filename wildcard which filters files in  the  listbox.   You  can  change  the
       filter and press enter to rescan the directory.

       Select  the  appropriate paper size and orientation.  Activate <b>Fill</b> <b>page</b> if you want the calendar to fill
       the page.  This should be the normal case unless you have many reminders in a particular day.   (See  the
       <b>Rem2PS</b> or <b>rem2pdf</b> documentation.)

       Finally,  click <b>Print</b> to print or <b>Cancel</b> to cancel.  Note that during printing, <b>Remind</b> is called with the
       <b>-itkremind=1</b> option and also an additional <b>-itkprint=1</b> option.  If you are producing PDF output, then the
       option <b>-itkpdf=1</b> is also supplied to <b>Remind</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EDITING</b> <b>REMINDERS</b></h4><pre>
       If you created a reminder with <b>TkRemind</b>, it will turn red as the mouse  cursor  passes  over  it  in  the
       calendar  window.   Click button-1 over the reminder and you will be presented with a dialog window whose
       state is identical to the one used to create the reminder.  At this point, you can change the reminder by
       editing the dialog entries and selecting <b>Replace</b> <b>reminder</b>.  You  can  delete  the  reminder  entirely  by
       selecting <b>Delete</b> <b>reminder</b>.  The remaining buttons, <b>Preview</b> <b>reminder</b> and <b>Cancel</b> operate identically to the
       dialog in "ADDING REMINDERS."

       Note  that  if  you  edit a reminder (using <b>Preview</b> <b>reminder</b>), any edits you made are <u>not</u> retained in the
       dialog box.  You should not attempt to edit such reminders; you  have  to  retype  them  in  the  <b>Preview</b>
       <b>reminder</b> dialog.

       If the reminder was not created with <b>TkRemind</b>, you can't edit it with <b>TkRemind</b>.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>A</b> <b>TEXT</b> <b>EDITOR</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  have  set  the "text editor" option correctly, right-clicking on a reminder will bring up a text
       editor on the file containing the reminder.  The cursor will be positioned on the line that generated the
       reminder.  In addition, if you have a reminder that is editable with an editor but was not created  using
       <b>TkRemind</b>, it will be underlined when you move the cursor over it, and you can edit it in a text editor by
       either left- or right-clicking on the reminder.

       If  a  reminder  has  location  or  description <b>INFO</b> items, then hovering over the reminder will pop up a
       window containing the location and/or description information.

</pre><h4><b>HYPERLINKS</b></h4><pre>
       If a reminder has a "Url:" INFO string set, then middle-clicking will open the URL using <b>xdg-open</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       If there are any errors in your reminder file, the "Queue..." button changes to  "Errors...".   Click  on
       "Errors..."  to see the Remind error output.  Click "OK" to close the error window; this makes the button
       in the main TkRemind window to revert to "Queue..."  You can click on any error message to open an editor
       on the file and line number that caused the error.

</pre><h4><b>BACKGROUND</b> <b>REMINDERS</b></h4><pre>
       If you create "timed" reminders, <b>TkRemind</b> will queue them in the background and pop up boxes as they  are
       triggered.   Additionally,  if  you  created the reminder using <b>TkRemind</b>, you will be given the option of
       "turning off" the reminder for the rest of the day.  <b>TkRemind</b> achieves queuing of background reminders by
       running <b>Remind</b> in <u>server</u> <u>mode</u>, described later.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The final button on the calendar window, <b>Options</b>, lets you configure certain aspects  of  <b>TkRemind</b>.   The
       configuration options are:

       <b>Start</b> <b>up</b> <b>Iconified</b>
              If this is selected, <b>TkRemind</b> starts up iconified.  Otherwise, it starts up in a normal window.

       <b>Show</b> <b>Today's</b> <b>Reminders</b> <b>on</b> <b>Startup</b>
              If  this  is  selected, <b>TkRemind</b> shows a text window containing reminders which would be issued by
              "remind -q -a -r" on startup, and when the date changes at midnight.

       <b>Confirm</b> <b>Quit</b>
              If this is selected, you will be asked to confirm when you press <b>Quit</b>.   If  not,  <b>TkRemind</b>  quits
              without prompting.

       <b>Automatically</b> <b>close</b> <b>pop-up</b> <b>reminders</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b>
              If  this  is  selected,  pop-up  reminder  boxes  will  be  closed  after  one minute has elapsed.
              Otherwise, they remain on your screen forever until you explicitly dismiss them.

       <b>Use</b> <b>system</b> <b>notifications</b> <b>when</b> <b>issuing</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b>
              This option is available only for Tcl/Tk version 9.0 or later, or  if  you  have  the  <b>notify-send</b>
              program  installed;  it will be greyed out if neither condition is true.  If selected, then when a
              reminder is popped up, it will also  be  sent  to  the  desktop  notification  system,  causing  a
              notification to appear.

       <b>Beep</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>when</b> <b>popping</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b>
              If selected, <b>TkRemind</b> beeps the terminal bell when a queued reminder pops up.

       <b>Deiconify</b> <b>calendar</b> <b>window</b> <b>when</b> <b>popping</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b>
              If selected, does what it says.

       <b>Run</b> <b>command</b> <b>when</b> <b>popping</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b>
              If this entry is not blank, the specified command is run whenever a background reminder pops up.

       <b>Feed</b> <b>popped-up</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>to</b> <b>command's</b> <b>standard</b> <b>input</b>
              If  selected,  feeds  the  text  of  the reminder to the command described above.  The text of the
              reminder is prefixed by "HH:MM ", where HH:MM is the time of the reminder.

       <b>E-mail</b> <b>reminders</b> <b>here</b> <b>if</b> <b>popup</b> <b>not</b> <b>dismissed</b>
              If you enter a non-blank e-mail address in this field, then <b>TkRemind</b> will e-mail you a reminder if
              you don't dismiss the popup box within one minute.  This is useful  if  you  need  to  leave  your
              terminal but want your reminders to "follow" you via e-mail.

       <b>Name</b> <b>or</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMTP</b> <b>server</b>
              <b>TkRemind</b>  uses  a  direct  SMTP connection to send mail.  Enter the IP address of your SMTP server
              here.

       <b>Text</b> <b>Editor</b>
              This specifies a text editor to invoke when a reminder is right-clicked.  The characters "%d"  are
              replaced with the lined number of the file containing the reminder, and "%s" are replaced with the
              file name.  Useful strings might be "emacs +%d %s" or "gvim +%d %s"

       <b>Extra</b> <b>Argument</b> <b>for</b> <b>Remind</b>
              This  specifies  any extra arguments that should be passed to Remind when <b>TkRemind</b> invokes <b>remind</b>.
              Unless you know what you are doing, leave this blank.

       <b>Change</b> <b>entry</b> <b>font...</b>
              This button pops up a font selection dialog that lets you change the font used  to  draw  calendar
              items in the calendar boxes.

       <b>Change</b> <b>heading</b> <b>font...</b>
              Similar to Change entry font, but applies to calendar heading (the month and day names and the day
              numbers.)

       Once  you've  configured  the options the way you like them, press <b>Apply</b> <b>Options</b> to put them into effect,
       <b>Save</b> <b>Options</b> to put them into effect and save them in $HOME/.config/tkremindrc, or <b>Cancel</b> to  cancel  any
       changes you made.

</pre><h4><b>KEYBOARD</b> <b>SHORTCUTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>TkRemind</b>'s main window includes the following keyboard shortcuts:

       <b>Ctrl-Q</b> Quit

       <b>Left</b> <b>Arrow</b>
              Previous Month

       <b>Right</b> <b>Arrow</b>
              Next Month

       <b>Home</b>   Today

</pre><h4><b>IMMEDIATE</b> <b>UPDATES</b></h4><pre>
       If  you are running <b>TkRemind</b> on Linux and <b>Remind</b> has been compiled with <b><a href="../man7/inotify.7.html">inotify</a></b>(7) support, then <b>TkRemind</b>
       redraws the calendar window <u>immediately</u> if <b>$HOME/.reminders</b> changes (or, if it is a directory, any  files
       in that directory change.)

       This lets <b>TkRemind</b> react immediately to hand-edited reminders or to reminder files that are imported from
       another  calendar  system  (for  example,  you  may have a cron job that periodically imports your Google
       Calendar entries into Remind format.)

</pre><h4><b>ODDS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>TkRemind</b> performs some basic consistency checks when you add or preview a reminder.  However, if you edit
       a reminder in the previewer, <b>TkRemind</b> does <u>not</u> check  the  edited  reminder.   You  can  produce  illegal
       reminders  which  may  cause  problems.   (This  is  one good reason to isolate <b>TkRemind</b>'s reminders in a
       separate file.)

       <b>TkRemind</b> does <u>not</u> check the body of the reminder in any way.  You can use the normal <b>Remind</b>  substitution
       sequences  in  the  body.   Furthermore,  if  you  use  expression-pasting in the body, <b>TkRemind</b> does <u>not</u>
       validate the expressions.

       When <b>TkRemind</b> invokes <b>Remind</b>, it supplies the option:

            -itkremind=1

       on the command line.  So, in your <b>Remind</b> file, you can include:

            IF defined("tkremind")
                 # Then I'm probably being invoked by TkRemind
            ENDIF

       You can use this to activate certain reminders in different ways for <b>TkRemind</b> (for example).

       <b>TkRemind</b> uses tags to keep track of reminders in the script file. You can  certainly  mix  "hand-crafted"
       reminders with reminders created by <b>TkRemind</b> if you are aware of the following rules and limitations:

       o      <b>TkRemind</b>  uses  <b>TAG</b>s  of the form <b>TKTAG</b><u>nnn</u> where <u>nnn</u> is a number.  You should not use such <b>TAG</b>s in
              hand-crafted reminders.

       o      Hand-crafted reminders cannot be edited with <b>TkRemind</b>, and for hand-crafted timed  reminders,  you
              will not be presented with the "Don't remind me again" option when they pop up.

       However,  rather  than  mixing  hand-edited  files  with  <b>TkRemind</b>-generated  ones,  it is better to make
       <b>$HOME/.reminders</b> a directory and keep your hand-edited files in a separate  <b>*.rem</b>  file  than  <b>TkRemind</b>'s
       <b>100-tkremind.rem</b> file.

</pre><h4><b>SERVER</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Remind</b>  has  a special mode for interacting with programs like <b>TkRemind</b>.  This mode is called <u>server</u> <u>mode</u>
       and is selected by supplying the <b>-zj</b> option to <b>Remind</b>.

       In server mode, <b>Remind</b> operates similar to daemon mode, except it reads  commands  (one  per  line)  from
       standard input and writes status lines to standard output.  Each status line is a JSON object.

       The commands accepted in server mode are:

       EXIT   Terminate  the  <b>Remind</b>  process.   EOF  on  standard  input  does  the  same  thing.  <b>Remind</b> exits
              immediately without printing a JSON status line.

       STATUS Return the number of queued reminders.  The JSON object looks something like this:

              {"response":"queued","nqueued":n,"command":"STATUS"}

              where <u>n</u> is the number of reminders queued.

       QUEUE or JSONQUEUE
              Returns the contents of the queue.  The JSON object looks something like this:

              {"response":"queue","queue":[ ... ],"command":"QUEUE"}

              The value of the <b>queue</b> key is an array of JSON objects, each representing a queued reminder.

       TRANSLATE Any string goes here
              Returns the translation of "Any string goes here" according to <b>Remind</b>'s translation  table.   Note
              that  there must be exactly one space after TRANSLATE and before the string you wish to translate.
              The JSON object that results from "TRANSLATE New Moon" might look like this:

              {"response":"translate","translation":{"New Moon":"Nieuwe maan"},"command":"TRANSLATE"}

              As you see, the value of the <b>translation</b> key is an object whose key is the original text and value
              is the translated text.  A front-end can use TRANSLATE  do  its  own  localization;  for  example,
              TkRemind uses it to localize the moon phase popup window for the SPECIAL MOON display.

              If  the  argument  to  TRANSLATE  is  not in the translation table, then <b>Remind</b> <u>will</u> <u>not</u> <u>issue</u> <u>any</u>
              <u>response</u> <u>at</u> <u>all</u> to the TRANSLATE command.

       TRANSLATE_DUMP
              Returns the contents of the translation table.  The JSON object looks like this:

              {"response":"translate_dump","table":{...},"command":"TRANSLATE_DUMP"}

              The value of the <b>table</b> key is a dictionary of original-to-translated strings.

       DEL <u>qid</u>
              Delete the reminder with queue-id <u>qid</u> from the queue.

       REREAD Re-read the reminder file.  Returns the following status line:

              {"response":"reread","command":"REREAD"}

       Additional status lines written are as follows:

       {"response":"reminder","ttime":tt,"now":now,"tags":tags,"qid":qid,"body":body}

              In this line, <u>tt</u> is the trigger time of the reminder (expressed as a string), <u>now</u> is  the  current
              time,  <u>tags</u>  (if present) is the tag or tags associated with the reminder, and <u>body</u> is the body of
              the reminder.  This response causes <b>TkRemind</b> to pop up a reminder notification.  <u>qid</u> is  a  unique
              identifier  for  this  reminder.  You may delete it from the queue by sending a <b>DEL</b> <u>qid</u> command to
              the server.  Note that <u>qid</u>s are not stable across re-reads; if <b>Remind</b> restarts itself  to  re-read
              the  reminder  file, then the <u>qid</u> values are likely to change, and any reminder deleted with a <b>DEL</b>
              <u>qid</u> command is likely to be re-queued.

       {"response":"newdate"}

              This line is emitted whenever <b>Remind</b> has detected a rollover of the system  date.   The  front-end
              program should redraw its calendar or take whatever other action is needed.

       {"response":"reread","command":"inotify"}

              If  <b>Remind</b>  was compiled with support for <b><a href="../man7/inotify.7.html">inotify</a></b>(7), then if it detects a change to the top-level
              reminder file or directory, it issues  the  above  response.   The  front-end  should  redraw  its
              calendar  since  this  response  indicates  that  a  change  has been made to the reminder file or
              directory.

       Please note that <b>Remind</b> can write a status message <u>at</u> <u>any</u> <u>time</u> and not just in response to a command sent
       to its standard input.  Therefore, a program that runs <b>Remind</b> in server mode must be prepared  to  handle
       asynchronous status messages.
