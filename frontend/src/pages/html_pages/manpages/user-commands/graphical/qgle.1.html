</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       qgle — A Graphical Interface to GLE

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>qgle</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>qgle</b> command.

       This  manual  page  was  written for the <b>Debian</b> distribution because the original program does not have a
       manual page.  Instead, it  has  documentation  in  the  PDF  format  at  /usr/share/doc/gle-graphics/gle-
       manual.pdf.

       <b>qgle</b>  is  a  graphical  interface  to  GLE.   The  current GUI contains a preview window that can receive
       messages from GLE and display the resulting EPS file.  In  addition,  it  can  open  GLE  and  EPS  files
       directly (using Ghostscript and GLE).  It now has the capability to add and edit simple objects, such as,
       lines,  circles  and  arcs (snapping to a grid if required). It can also change various properties of the
       objects, such as, line width, and color. The perpendicular line and tangential line commands can be  used
       to  produce a line starting perpendicular or tangential to an existing object.  OSnap can be used for the
       end point of a line.
