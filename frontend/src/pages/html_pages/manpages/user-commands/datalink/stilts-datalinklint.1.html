</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       stilts-datalinklint - Validates DataLink documents

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>stilts</b> <b>datalinklint</b> [votable=<u>&lt;filename&gt;|&lt;URL&gt;|-</u>] [version=<u>1.0|1.1</u>] [format=<u>text|json</u>] [report=<u>[EWISF]+</u>]
                           [maxrepeat=<u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>] [truncate=<u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>] [debug=<u>true|false</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>datalinklint</u> runs a series of tests on a VOTable that is supposed to conform to the {links}-response for‐
       mat  defined in the IVOA DataLink specification, and reports the results. This is not likely to be of use
       to normal users, it is intended for people developing or operating DataLink-compliant services to  assess
       correctness, perhaps with a view to improving compliance.

       To  run it, you point it at the URL or filename of a VOTable of interest, and it runs various tests on it
       and reports them to standard output. Only the input table itself, and if the input location uses HTTP the
       HTTP headers, are tested, this validator does not inspect any other  resources.  As  well  as  validation
       checks,  some  reporting  of the table's content (such as a summary of the link defined by each row and a
       listing of the defined service descriptors) is provided as INFO-level output for convenience. This can be
       suppressed if preferred by use of the <u>report</u> parameter.

       This operates in much the same way as the <u>taplint</u> command, and the output has a  similar  format,  though
       unlike  <u>taplint</u> this command does not divide the testing up into stages. Each report line is of the form:
       T-MMMMxN aaaaa... where the parts have the following meanings:

         * <u>T</u>: Report type, one of E(rror), W(arning), I(nfo), S(ummary), F(ailure). See the documentation of the
           <u>report</u> parameter for further description of what these mean. The <u>report</u> parameter can be used to sup‐
           press some of these; only <u>E</u> indicates actual service compliance errors, but including the others  may
           make it easier to see what's going on.

         * <u>MMMM</u>:  Message  label,  which  is always the same for messages generated by the same test, is usually
           different for messages generated by different tests, and may be somewhat mnemonic.

         * <u>x</u>: Continuation indicator, either "<u>-</u>" or "<u>+</u>". In most cases it is "<u>-</u>", indicating the first line of a
           message, but multi-line messages (rare) use "<u>-</u>" for the first  line  and  "<u>+</u>"  for  any  continuation
           lines.

         * <u>N</u>:  Sequence  number,  which is 1 for the first time message <u>T-MMMM</u> is reported, and increases by one
           for each subsequent appearance. After a certain maximum (determined by the <u>maxrepeat</u> parameter) addi‐
           tional reports with the same code are no longer output individually, but a summary of the  number  of
           reports  so  discarded is written at the end of the section with the character "<u>x</u>" instead of the se‐
           quence number. This behaviour prevents the output being swamped by multiple reports of the  same  is‐
           sue.  If the <u>maxrepeat</u> parameter is increased above 9, more than one digit will be used here (so e.g.
           for maxrepeat=999, the format would be <u>NNN</u> not <u>N</u>).

         * <u>aaaaa...</u>: Message text, a free text description of what is being reported.

       If you don't like that format, others may be selected using the <u>format</u> parameter,  which  currently  also
       supports JSON. For more flexible interaction with the output you can invoke <u>datalinklint</u> programmatically
       and supply your own instance.

       As  with  any  validator,  this command does not guarantee to pick up everything wrong with the indicated
       VOTable, but it tries as hard as it can to check against the rules set out in the DataLink  specification
       and other related documents as appropriate. A non-exhaustive list of the items checked is:

         * VOTable validation à la <u>votlint</u>

         * Correct RESOURCE structure of VOTable document

         * All required columns are present with mandated metadata

         * Optional but documented columns have mandated metadata if present

         * Each row contains one of <u>access_url</u>, <u>service_def</u>, <u>error_message</u>

         * Service descriptors correctly specified and referenced

         * Syntax of <u>error_message</u> column values

         * Syntax of <u>content_type</u> column values

         * Syntax of <u>semantics</u> column values

         * Values of <u>content_qualifier</u> column values if present

         * Syntax of <u>link_auth</u> column values if present

         * Results for the same ID are contiguous (DataLink 1.1)

         * StandardID INFO is present and correct (Datalink 1.1)

         * Reported HTTP content-type, if applicable

         * Correct serialization (TABLEDATA) is used

         * DALI error-response checking, if applicable
        At  present  <b>no</b>  <b>checking</b> is performed on the link targets; tests are confined to the presented document
       itself.

       HTTP connections made by this validator are flagged in the <u>User-Agent</u> field with the token "<u>(IVOA-test)</u>".

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>votable=</b><u>&lt;filename&gt;|&lt;URL&gt;|-</u>
              Location of the DataLink VOTable document to check. This may be a URL, or a filename, or the  spe‐
              cial value "<u>-</u>" to indicate standard input.

       <b>version=</b><u>1.0|1.1</u>
              Selects  the  version of the DataLink standard which the input document is supposed to conform to.
              If left blank, the default, then the version will be determined from the document itself if possi‐
              ble, otherwise a default value for the application will be used.

              Options are currently:

                * <u>1.0</u>: REC-DataLink-1.0

                * <u>1.1</u>: REC-DataLink-1.1

              If a non-null version is specified and it conflicts with declarations in the document itself, this
              conflict will be reported as an error.

       <b>format=</b><u>text|json</u>
              Determines the format of the output. Possible values are <u>text</u>, <u>json</u>.

              Note not all of the other parameters may be applicable to all output formats.

       <b>report=</b><u>[EWISF]+</u>
              Letters indicating which message types should be listed. Each character of the string  is  one  of
              the letters <u>E</u>, <u>W</u>, <u>I</u>, <u>S</u>, <u>F</u> with the following meanings:

                * <u>E</u>: Error in operation or standard compliance of the service.

                * <u>W</u>:  Warning  that service behaviour is questionable, or contravenes a standard recommendation,
                  but is not in actual violation of the standard.

                * <u>I</u>: Information about progress, for instance details of queries made.

                * <u>S</u>: Summary of previous successful/unsuccessful reports.

                * <u>F</u>: Failure of the validator to perform some testing. The cause is either some  error  internal
                  to the validator, or some error or missing functionality in the service which has already been
                  reported.

       <b>maxrepeat=</b><u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>
              Puts  a  limit  on  the number of times that a single message will be repeated. By setting this to
              some reasonably small number, you can ensure that the output does not get cluttered up by millions
              of repetitions of essentially the same error.

       <b>truncate=</b><u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>
              Limits the line length written to the output.

       <b>debug=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true, debugging output including stack traces will be output along with the  normal  validation
              messages.
