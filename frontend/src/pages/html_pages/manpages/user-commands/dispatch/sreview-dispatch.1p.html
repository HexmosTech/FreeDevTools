</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sreview-dispatch - Watch the database for talks that need work done, and schedule jobs for them

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       sreview-dispatch

</pre><h4><b>DESCRITPION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sreview-dispatch</b> is the central script for SReview. It can be used in two ways:

       1.  Either  you  run  it  with  an external scheduler (e.g., gridengine, slurm, PBS, torque). This is the
           recommended  way  of  using  SReview  for  large  installations.   In   this   mode   of   operation,
           "sreview-dispatch"  should  be  run  once  in the entire network, and the "query_limit" configuration
           value should be set to 0.

       2.  Or you run it with no external scheduler. This is the default. In  this  mode  of  operation,  it  is
           recommended  that  the  "query_limit"  configuration  parameter  is  set  to a nonzero value, so that
           individual "sreview-dispatch" instances do not take all the work, keeping  all  the  other  instances
           idle.  In this mode of operation, one "sreview-dispatch" instance should be run per CPU core on every
           machine that is used for performing work.

           This mode works, but using an external scheduler allows for operating more flexibly on pending  jobs,
           and on the addition or removal of extra nodes.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.  "sreview-dispatch" uses the system-wide SReview configuration.  For more information, see sreview-
       config

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       "sreview-dispatch" considers the following configuration values:

       dbistring
           The database connection string

       state_actions
           A hash table of shell commands to execute when a talk  is  found  in  a  particular  state  with  the
           "waiting" progress value. The hash key should be the state name.

           If  a  state  is  not specified in the "state_actions" hash, then "sreview-dispatch" will <u>ignore</u> that
           state. This allows for handling particular states on particular hosts, if necessary.

           The shell commands can use the following template variables:

           &lt;%== $talkid %&gt;
               The database ID of the talk to work on

           &lt;%== $output_dir %&gt;
               The value of the "script_output" configuration item, i.e., where to redirect output to.

       query_limit
           The maximum number of requests that should be handled per loop. Should be set to 0 (meaning infinity)
           when using an external scheduler; should probably be set to 1 when not.

       event
           The event in use for this instance of SReview. In previous versions of SReview, the dispatcher  would
           run things for every event in the database; since version 0.4 this is no longer the case. This allows
           multiple instances of SReview to exist on the same host, sharing the same database if wanted.

       script_output
           The location where stderr and stdout output should be written to. This is supposed to be a directory;
           it is reasonable to create a file for stderr and a file for stdout for each script run.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       "sreview-dispatch"  currently  polls  the  database every 10 seconds. This should be changed to an event-
       based system based on PostgreSQL asynchronous notifications.
