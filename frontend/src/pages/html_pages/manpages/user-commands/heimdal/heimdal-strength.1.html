</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       heimdal-strength - Heimdal password quality check embedding CrackLib

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>heimdal-strength</b> [<u>principal</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>heimdal-strength</b> is an external password quality check program for Heimdal that verifies the strength of
       a password.  Passwords can be tested with CrackLib, checked against a CDB database of known weak
       passwords, checked for length, checked for non-printable or non-ASCII characters that may be difficult to
       enter reproducibly, required to contain particular character classes, or any combination of these tests.
       It is normally run via <b><a href="../man8/kpasswdd.8.html">kpasswdd</a></b>(8) using the Heimdal password quality check interface rather than
       directly.

       To use this program, it must be configured in <u>krb5.conf</u> via settings in "[appdefaults]" for the
       application name "krb5-strength".  A typical setting would be:

           krb5-strength = {
               password_dictionary = /usr/local/lib/kadmind/dictionary
           }

       which says to check passwords with CrackLib using the given path as the base path of the CrackLib
       dictionary.  See "CONFIGURATION" below for details on the supported configuration options.

       <b>heimdal-strength</b> then expects the Heimdal password quality check information on standard input,
       specifically:

           principal: &lt;principal&gt;
           new-password: &lt;password&gt;
           end

       where &lt;principal&gt; is the principal whose password would be changed and &lt;password&gt; is the new password.
       If the password appears to be strong, it prints "APPROVED" on standard output and exits with a status of
       0.  If the password is rejected as being too weak, it will print the reason for rejecting the password on
       standard error and exit with a status of 0.  If some fatal error occurs, it will print that error to
       standard error and exit with a non-zero status.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The following <u>krb5.conf</u> configuration options are supported:

       cracklib_maxlen
           Normally,  all  passwords  are  checked  with CrackLib if a CrackLib dictionary is defined.  However,
           CrackLib's rules were designed for a world in which most passwords  were  four  to  eight  characters
           long,  and tends to spuriously reject a lot of passphrases.  If this option is set to something other
           than its default of 0, passwords longer than that length bypass CrackLib  checks.   (Using  a  SQLite
           dictionary for longer passwords is strongly recommended.)

       minimum_different
           If  set  to  a  numeric  value,  passwords  with  fewer than this number of unique characters will be
           rejected.  This can be used to reject, for example, passwords that  are  long  strings  of  the  same
           character or repetitions of small numbers of characters, which may be too easy to guess.

       minimum_length
           If  set  to  a  numeric  value, passwords with fewer than that number of characters will be rejected,
           independent of any length restrictions in CrackLib.  Note that  this  setting  does  not  bypass  the
           minimum length requirements in CrackLib itself.

       password_dictionary
           Specifies  the  base  path  to  a  CrackLib  dictionary  and  enables password strength testing using
           CrackLib.  The provided path should be the full path to the dictionary files, omitting  the  trailing
           <u>*.hwm</u>, <u>*.pwd</u>, and <u>*.pwi</u> extensions for the CrackLib dictionary.

       password_dictionary_cdb
           Specifies  the  base  path to a CDB dictionary and enables CDB password dictionary lookups.  The path
           must point to a CDB-format database whose keys are the known  passwords  or  dictionary  words.   The
           values are ignored.  You can use the <b>krb5-strength-wordlist</b> utility to generate the CDB database from
           a word list.

           The  CDB dictionary lookups do not do the complex password mangling that CrackLib does.  Instead, the
           password itself will be checked against the dictionary, and then variations of the password formed by
           removing the first character, the last character, the  first  and  last  characters,  the  first  two
           characters,  and the last two characters.  If any of these strings are found in the CDB database, the
           password will be rejected; otherwise, it will be accepted, at least by this check.

           A CrackLib dictionary, a CDB dictionary, and a SQLite dictionary may all be configured  at  the  same
           time or in any combination, in which case CrackLib will be run first, followed by CDB and then SQLite
           as appropriate.

       password_dictionary_sqlite
           Specifies  the  base path to a SQLite dictionary and enables SQLite password dictionary lookups.  The
           path must point to a SQLite 3 database with a table named "passwords".  This table  should  have  two
           columns,  "password" and "drowssap", which, for each dictionary word, holds the word and the reversed
           form of the word.  You can use the <b>krb5-strength-wordlist</b> utility to  generate  the  SQLite  database
           from a word list.

           The  SQLite  dictionary  lookups do not do the complex password mangling that CrackLib does, but they
           will detect and reject any password that is within edit distance one of a  word  in  the  dictionary,
           meaning  that the dictionary word can be formed from the password by adding, deleting, or modifying a
           single character.

           A CrackLib dictionary, a CDB dictionary, and a SQLite dictionary may all be configured  at  the  same
           time or in any combination, in which case CrackLib will be run first, followed by CDB and then SQLite
           as appropriate.

       require_ascii_printable
           If  set  to  a  true  boolean value, rejects any password that contains non-ASCII characters or ASCII
           control characters.  Spaces are allowed; tabs are not (at least assuming the  POSIX  C  locale).   No
           canonicalization  or  character  set is defined for Kerberos passwords in general, so you may want to
           reject non-ASCII characters to avoid interoperability problems with computers with different  default
           character sets or Unicode normalization forms.

       require_classes
           This  option  allows  specification  of more complex character class requirements.  The value of this
           parameter should be one or more whitespace-separated rule.  Each rule has the syntax:

               [&lt;min&gt;-&lt;max&gt;:]&lt;class&gt;[,&lt;class&gt;...]

           where &lt;class&gt; is one of "upper", "lower", "digit",  or  "symbol".   The  symbol  class  includes  all
           characters  other  than  alphanumeric characters, including space.  The listed classes must appear in
           the password.  Separate multiple required classes with a comma (and no space).

           The character class checks will be done in whatever locale the plugin or password  check  program  is
           run  in,  which  will  normally  be  the  POSIX  C  locale  but  may  be different depending on local
           configuration.

           A simple example:

               require_classes = upper,lower,digit

           This requires all passwords contain at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, and
           at least one digit.

           If present, &lt;min&gt; and &lt;max&gt; specify the minimum password length and maximum password length to  which
           this rule applies.  This allows one to specify character class requirements that change with password
           length.  So, for example:

               require_classes = 8-19:upper,lower 8-15:digit 8-11:symbol

           requires  all  passwords  from  8 to 11 characters long contain all four character classes, passwords
           from 12 to 15 characters long contain upper and lower case and a digit, and passwords from 16  to  19
           characters  long  contain  both  upper  and  lower case.  Passwords longer than 20 characters have no
           character class restrictions.  (This example is probably used in conjunction  with  minimum_length  =
           8.)

       require_non_letter
           If set to a true boolean value, the password must contain at least one character that is not a letter
           (uppercase  or lowercase) or a space.  This may be helpful in combination with passphrases; users may
           choose a stock English phrase, and this will force at least some additional complexity.
