</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mia-mesh-to-maskimage - Create a binary mask from the mesh surfac.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mia-mesh-to-maskimage</b> <b>-i</b> <b>&lt;in-file&gt;</b> <b>-o</b> <b>&lt;out-file&gt;</b> <b>[options]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mia-mesh-to-maskimage</b> This program converts a 3D mesh into a binary mask comprising the mesh surface. The
       output image size is either given on the command line or deducted from the mesh dimensions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>File</b> <b>I/O</b>
              -i --in-file=(input, required); io
                     input mesh to be adapted
                      For supported file types see PLUGINS:mesh/io

              -o --out-file=(output, required); io
                     output image containing the binary mask
                      For supported file types see PLUGINS:3dimage/io

                     the number of logical processor cores in the machine. (-1: automatic estimation).

   <b>Properties</b>
                 --origin=[0,0,0]
