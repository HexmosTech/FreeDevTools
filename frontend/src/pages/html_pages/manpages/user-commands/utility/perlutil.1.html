       perlutil - utilities packaged with the Perl distribution

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Along with the Perl interpreter itself, the Perl distribution installs a range of utilities on your
       system. There are also several utilities which are used by the Perl distribution itself as part of the
       install process. This document exists to list all of these utilities, explain what they are for and
       provide pointers to each module's documentation, if appropriate.

</pre><h4><b>LIST</b> <b>OF</b> <b>UTILITIES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Documentation</b>
       perldoc
          The main interface to Perl's documentation is <u>perldoc</u>, although if you're reading this, it's more than
          likely  that  you've already found it. <u>perldoc</u> will extract and format the documentation from any file
          in the current  directory,  any  Perl  module  installed  on  the  system,  or  any  of  the  standard
          documentation pages, such as this one. Use "perldoc &lt;name&gt;" to get information on any of the utilities
          described in this document.

       pod2man
       pod2text
          If  it's  run  from  a  terminal,  <u>perldoc</u>  will  usually  call  <u>pod2man</u>  to  translate POD (Plain Old
          Documentation - see perlpod for an explanation) into a manpage, and then run <u>man</u> to display it; if <u>man</u>
          isn't available, <u>pod2text</u> will be used instead and the output piped through your favourite pager.

       pod2html
          As well as these two, there is another converter: <u>pod2html</u> will produce HTML pages from POD.

       pod2usage
          If you just want to know how to use the utilities described here,  <u>pod2usage</u>  will  just  extract  the
          "USAGE"  section;  some of the utilities will automatically call <u>pod2usage</u> on themselves when you call
          them with "-help".

       podchecker
          If you're writing your own documentation in POD, the <u>podchecker</u> utility will look for errors  in  your
          markup.

       splain
          <u>splain</u> is an interface to perldiag - paste in your error message to it, and it'll explain it for you.

       <u>roffitall</u>
          The  <u>roffitall</u>  utility  is  not installed on your system but lives in the <u>pod/</u> directory of your Perl
          source kit; it converts all the documentation from the distribution to <u>*roff</u> format,  and  produces  a
          typeset PostScript or text file of the whole lot.

   <b>Converters</b>
       pl2pm
          To  help you convert legacy programs to more modern Perl, the <u>pl2pm</u> utility will help you convert old-
          style Perl 4 libraries to new-style Perl5 modules.

   <b>Administration</b>
       libnetcfg
          To display and change the libnet configuration run the libnetcfg command.

       perlivp
          The <u>perlivp</u> program is set up at Perl source code build time to test the Perl  version  it  was  built
          under.   It  can  be  used  after  running "make install" (or your platform's equivalent procedure) to
          verify that perl and its libraries have been installed correctly.

   <b>Development</b>
       There are a set of utilities which help you in developing Perl programs,  and  in  particular,  extending
       Perl with C.

       perlbug
          <u>perlbug</u>  used  to  be  the recommended way to report bugs in the perl interpreter itself or any of the
          standard library modules back to the developers; bug reports and patches should now  be  submitted  to
          &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.

       perlthanks
          This  program  provides an easy way to send a thank-you message back to the authors and maintainers of
          perl. It's just <u>perlbug</u> installed under another name.

       h2ph
          Back before Perl had the XS system for connecting with C libraries, programmers used  to  get  library
          constants  by  reading through the C header files. You may still see "require 'syscall.ph'" or similar
          around - the <u>.ph</u> file should be created by running <u>h2ph</u> on the corresponding <u>.h</u>  file.  See  the  h2ph
          documentation for more on how to convert a whole bunch of header files at once.

       h2xs
          <u>h2xs</u>  converts C header files into XS modules, and will try and write as much glue between C libraries
          and Perl modules as it can. It's also very useful for creating skeletons of pure Perl modules.

       enc2xs
          <u>enc2xs</u> builds a Perl extension for use by Encode from either Unicode Character Mapping files (.ucm) or
          Tcl Encoding Files (.enc).  Besides being used internally during  the  build  process  of  the  Encode
          module, you can use <u>enc2xs</u> to add your own encoding to perl.  No knowledge of XS is necessary.

       xsubpp
          <u>xsubpp</u>  is  a  compiler  to  convert  Perl  XS code into C code.  It is typically run by the makefiles
          created by ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

          <u>xsubpp</u> will compile XS code into C code by embedding the  constructs  necessary  to  let  C  functions
          manipulate Perl values and creates the glue necessary to let Perl access those functions.

       prove
          <u>prove</u>  is  a  command-line  interface  to  the  test-running  functionality of Test::Harness.  It's an
          alternative to "make test".

       corelist
          A command-line front-end to Module::CoreList, to query what modules were shipped with  given  versions
          of perl.

   <b>General</b> <b>tools</b>
       A few general-purpose tools are shipped with perl, mostly because they came along modules included in the
       perl distribution.

       encguess
          <u>encguess</u> will attempt to guess the character encoding of files.

       json_pp
          <u>json_pp</u> is a pure Perl JSON converter and formatter.

       piconv
          <u>piconv</u>  is  a  Perl  version  of <b><a href="../man1/iconv.1.html">iconv</a></b>(1), a character encoding converter widely available for various
          Unixen today.  This script was primarily a technology demonstrator for Perl v5.8.0, but  you  can  use
          piconv in the place of iconv for virtually any case.

       ptar
          <u>ptar</u> is a tar-like program, written in pure Perl.

       ptardiff
          <u>ptardiff</u>  is a small utility that produces a diff between an extracted archive and an unextracted one.
          (Note that this utility requires the  Text::Diff  module  to  function  properly;  this  module  isn't
          distributed with perl, but is available from the CPAN.)

       ptargrep
          <u>ptargrep</u> is a utility to apply pattern matching to the contents of files in a tar archive.

       shasum
          This utility, that comes with the Digest::SHA module, is used to print or verify SHA checksums.

       streamzip
          <u>streamzip</u> compresses data streamed to STDIN into a streamed zip container.

       zipdetails
          <u>zipdetails</u>  displays  information  about  the  internal  record  structure of the zip file.  It is not
          concerned with displaying any details of the compressed data stored in the zip file.

   <b>Installation</b>
       These utilities help manage extra Perl modules that don't come with the perl distribution.

       cpan
          <u>cpan</u> is a command-line interface to CPAN.pm.  It allows you to install modules or  distributions  from
          CPAN,  or  just get information about them, and a lot more.  It is similar to the command line mode of
          the CPAN module,

              perl -MCPAN -e shell

       instmodsh
          A little interface to ExtUtils::Installed to examine installed modules, validate  your  packlists  and
          even create a tarball from an installed module.
