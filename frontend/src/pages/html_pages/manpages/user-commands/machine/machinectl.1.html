</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       machinectl - Control the systemd machine manager

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>machinectl</b> [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND} [NAME...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>machinectl</b> may be used to introspect and control the state of the <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) virtual machine and
       container registration manager <b><a href="../man8/systemd-machined.service.8.html">systemd-machined.service</a></b>(8).

       <b>machinectl</b> may be used to execute operations on machines and images. Machines in this sense are
       considered running instances of:

       •   Virtual Machines (VMs) that virtualize hardware to run full operating system (OS) instances
           (including their kernels) in a virtualized environment on top of the host OS.

       •   Containers that share the hardware and OS kernel with the host OS, in order to run OS userspace
           instances on top the host OS.

       •   The host system itself.

       Machines are identified by names that follow the same rules as UNIX and DNS hostnames. For details, see
       below.

       Machines are instantiated from disk or file system images that frequently — but not necessarily — carry
       the same name as machines running from them. Images in this sense may be:

       •   Directory trees containing an OS, including the top-level directories <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>, <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>, and so on.

       •   btrfs subvolumes containing OS trees, similar to regular directory trees.

       •   Binary "raw" disk image files containing MBR or GPT partition tables and Linux file systems.

       •   Similarly, block devices containing MBR or GPT partition tables and file systems.

       •   The file system tree of the host OS itself.

       Images may be downloaded, imported and exported via the <b><a href="../man1/importctl.1.html">importctl</a></b>(1) tool.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following commands are understood:

   <b>Machine</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>list</b>
           List currently running (online) virtual machines and containers. To enumerate machine images that can
           be started, use <b>list-images</b> (see below). Note that this command hides the special ".host" machine by
           default. Use the <b>--all</b> switch to show it.

           Added in version 206.

       <b>status</b> <u>NAME</u>...
           Show runtime status information about one or more virtual machines and containers, followed by the
           most recent log data from the journal. This function is intended to generate human-readable output.
           If you are looking for computer-parsable output, use <b>show</b> instead. Note that the log data shown is
           reported by the virtual machine or container manager, and frequently contains console output of the
           machine, but not necessarily journal contents of the machine itself.

           Added in version 206.

       <b>show</b> [<u>NAME</u>...]
           Show properties of one or more registered virtual machines or containers or the manager itself. If no
           argument is specified, properties of the manager will be shown. If a NAME is specified, properties of
           this virtual machine or container are shown. By default, empty properties are suppressed. Use <b>--all</b>
           to show those too. To select specific properties to show, use <b>--property=</b>. This command is intended
           to be used whenever computer-parsable output is required, and does not print the control group tree
           or journal entries. Use <b>status</b> if you are looking for formatted human-readable output.

           Added in version 206.

       <b>start</b> <u>NAME</u>...
           Start a container as a system service, using <b><a href="../man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn</a></b>(1). This starts systemd-nspawn@.service,
           instantiated for the specified machine name, similar to the effect of <b>systemctl</b> <b>start</b> on the service
           name.  <b>systemd-nspawn</b> looks for a container image by the specified name in /var/lib/machines/ (and
           other search paths, see below) and runs it. Use <b>list-images</b> (see below) for listing available
           container images to start.

           Note that <b><a href="../man8/systemd-machined.service.8.html">systemd-machined.service</a></b>(8) also interfaces with a variety of other container and VM
           managers, <b>systemd-nspawn</b> is just one implementation of it. Most of the commands available in
           <b>machinectl</b> may be used on containers or VMs controlled by other managers, not just <b>systemd-nspawn</b>.
           Starting VMs and container images on those managers requires manager-specific tools.

           To interactively start a container on the command line with full access to the container's console,
           please invoke <b>systemd-nspawn</b> directly. To stop a running container use <b>machinectl</b> <b>poweroff</b>.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>login</b> [<u>NAME</u>]
           Open an interactive terminal login session in a container or on the local host. If an argument is
           supplied, it refers to the container machine to connect to. If none is specified, or the container
           name is specified as the empty string, or the special machine name ".host" (see below) is specified,
           the connection is made to the local host instead. This will create a TTY connection to a specific
           container or the local host and asks for the execution of a getty on it. Note that this is only
           supported for containers running <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) as init system.

           This command will open a full login prompt on the container or the local host, which then asks for
           username and password. Use <b>shell</b> (see below) or <b><a href="../man1/systemd-run.1.html">systemd-run</a></b>(1) with the <b>--machine=</b> switch to directly
           invoke a single command, either interactively or in the background.

           Added in version 209.

       <b>shell</b> [[<u>NAME</u>@]<u>NAME</u> [<u>PATH</u> [<u>ARGUMENTS</u>...]]]
           Open an interactive shell session in a container or on the local host. The first argument refers to
           the container machine to connect to. If none is specified, or the machine name is specified as the
           empty string, or the special machine name ".host" (see below) is specified, the connection is made to
           the local host instead. This works similarly to <b>login</b>, but immediately invokes a user process. This
           command runs the specified executable with the specified arguments, or the default shell for the user
           if none is specified, or <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> if no default shell is found. By default, <b>--uid=</b>, or by prefixing
           the machine name with a username and an "@" character, a different user may be selected. Use
           <b>--setenv=</b> to set environment variables for the executed process.

           Note that <b>machinectl</b> <b>shell</b> does not propagate the exit code/status of the invoked shell process. Use
           <b>systemd-run</b> instead if that information is required (see below).

           Using the <b>shell</b> command without arguments (thus invoking the executed shell or command on the local
           host), is in many ways similar to a <b><a href="../man1/su.1.html">su</a></b>(1) session, but, unlike <b>su</b>, completely isolates the new
           session from the originating session, so that it shares no process or session properties and is in a
           clean well-defined state. It will be tracked in a new utmp, login, audit, security, and keyring
           sessions, and will not inherit any environment variables or resource limits, among other properties.

           Note that <b><a href="../man1/systemd-run.1.html">systemd-run</a></b>(1) with its <b>--machine=</b> switch may be used in place of the <b>machinectl</b> <b>shell</b>
           command, and allows non-interactive operation, more detailed and low-level configuration of the
           invoked unit, as well as access to runtime and exit code/status information of the invoked shell
           process. In particular, use <b>systemd-run</b>'s <b>--wait</b> switch to propagate exit status information of the
           invoked process. Use <b>systemd-run</b>'s <b>--pty</b> switch to acquire an interactive shell, similarly to
           <b>machinectl</b> <b>shell</b>. In general, <b>systemd-run</b> is preferable for scripting purposes. However, note that
           <b>systemd-run</b> might require higher privileges than <b>machinectl</b> <b>shell</b>.

           Added in version 225.

       <b>enable</b> <u>NAME</u>..., <b>disable</b> <u>NAME</u>...
           Enable or disable a container as a system service to start at system boot, using <b><a href="../man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn</a></b>(1).
           This enables or disables systemd-nspawn@.service, instantiated for the specified machine name,
           similarly to the effect of <b>systemctl</b> <b>enable</b> or <b>systemctl</b> <b>disable</b> on the service name.

           This command implicitly reloads the system manager configuration after completing the operation. Note
           that this command does not implicitly start or power off the containers that are being operated on.
           If this is desired, combine the command with the <b>--now</b> switch.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>poweroff</b> <u>NAME</u>...
           Power off one or more containers. This will trigger a shutdown by sending SIGRTMIN+4 to the
           container's init process, which causes systemd-compatible init systems to shut down cleanly. Use <b>stop</b>
           as alias for <b>poweroff</b>. This operation does not work on containers that do not run a
           <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1)-compatible init system, such as sysvinit. Use <b>terminate</b> (see below) to immediately
           terminate a container or VM, without cleanly shutting it down.

           Added in version 212.

       <b>reboot</b> <u>NAME</u>...
           Reboot one or more containers. This will trigger a reboot by sending SIGINT to the container's init
           process, which is roughly equivalent to pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del on a non-containerized system, and is
           compatible with containers running any system manager. Use <b>restart</b> as alias for <b>reboot</b>.

           Added in version 209.

       <b>terminate</b> <u>NAME</u>...
           Immediately terminates a virtual machine or container, without cleanly shutting it down. This kills
           all processes of the virtual machine or container and deallocates all resources attached to that
           instance. Use <b>poweroff</b> to issue a clean shutdown request.

           Added in version 206.

       <b>kill</b> <u>NAME</u>...
           Send a signal to one or more processes of the virtual machine or container. This means processes as
           seen by the host, not the processes inside the virtual machine or container. Use <b>--kill-whom=</b> to
           select which process to kill. Use <b>--signal=</b> to select the signal to send.

           Added in version 206.

       <b>bind</b> <u>NAME</u> <u>PATH</u> [<u>PATH</u>]
           Bind mounts a file or directory from the host into the specified container. The first path argument
           is the source file or directory on the host, the second path argument is the destination file or
           directory in the container. When the latter is omitted, the destination path in the container is the
           same as the source path on the host. When combined with the <b>--read-only</b> switch, a ready-only bind
           mount is created. When combined with the <b>--mkdir</b> switch, the destination path is first created before
           the mount is applied. Note that this option is currently only supported for <b><a href="../man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn</a></b>(1)
           containers, and only if user namespacing (<b>--private-users</b>) is not used. This command supports bind
           mounting directories, regular files, device nodes, <b>AF_UNIX</b> socket nodes, as well as FIFOs.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>copy-to</b> <u>NAME</u> <u>PATH</u> [<u>PATH</u>] <b>--force</b>
           Copies files or directories from the host system into a running container. Takes a container name,
           followed by the source path on the host and the destination path in the container. If the destination
           path is omitted, the same as the source path is used.

           If host and container share the same user and group namespace, file ownership by numeric user ID and
           group ID is preserved for the copy, otherwise all files and directories in the copy will be owned by
           the root user and group (UID/GID 0).

           Added in version 219.

       <b>copy-from</b> <u>NAME</u> <u>PATH</u> [<u>PATH</u>] <b>--force</b>
           Copies files or directories from a container into the host system. Takes a container name, followed
           by the source path in the container and the destination path on the host. If the destination path is
           omitted, the same as the source path is used.

           If host and container share the same user and group namespace, file ownership by numeric user ID and
           group ID is preserved for the copy, otherwise all files and directories in the copy will be owned by
           the root user and group (UID/GID 0).

           Added in version 219.

   <b>Image</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>list-images</b>
           Show a list of locally installed container and VM images. This enumerates all raw disk images and
           container directories and subvolumes in /var/lib/machines/ (and other search paths, see below). Use
           <b>start</b> (see above) to run a container off one of the listed images. Note that, by default, containers
           whose name begins with a dot (".") are not shown. To show these too, specify <b>--all</b>. Note that a
           special image ".host" always implicitly exists and refers to the image the host itself is booted
           from.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>image-status</b> [<u>NAME</u>...]
           Show terse status information about one or more container or VM images. This function is intended to
           generate human-readable output. Use <b>show-image</b> (see below) to generate computer-parsable output
           instead.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>show-image</b> [<u>NAME</u>...]
           Show properties of one or more registered virtual machine or container images, or the manager itself.
           If no argument is specified, properties of the manager will be shown. If a NAME is specified,
           properties of this virtual machine or container image are shown. By default, empty properties are
           suppressed. Use <b>--all</b> to show those too. To select specific properties to show, use <b>--property=</b>. This
           command is intended to be used whenever computer-parsable output is required. Use <b>image-status</b> if you
           are looking for formatted human-readable output.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>edit</b> <u>NAME|FILE</u>
           Edit the settings file of the specified machines. For the format of the settings file, refer to
           <b><a href="../man5/systemd.nspawn.5.html">systemd.nspawn</a></b>(5). If an existing settings file of the given machine can't be found, <b>edit</b>
           automatically create a new settings file from scratch under /etc/systemd/nspawn/.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>cat</b> <u>NAME|FILE</u>
           Show the settings file of the specified machines.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>clone</b> <u>NAME</u> <u>NAME</u>
           Clones a container or VM image. The arguments specify the name of the image to clone and the name of
           the newly cloned image. Note that plain directory container images are cloned into btrfs subvolume
           images with this command, if the underlying file system supports this. Note that cloning a container
           or VM image is optimized for file systems that support copy-on-write, and might not be efficient on
           others, due to file system limitations.

           Note that this command leaves hostname, machine ID and all other settings that could identify the
           instance unmodified. The original image and the cloned copy will hence share these credentials, and
           it might be necessary to manually change them in the copy.

           If combined with the <b>--read-only</b> switch a read-only cloned image is created.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>rename</b> <u>NAME</u> <u>NAME</u>
           Renames a container or VM image. The arguments specify the name of the image to rename and the new
           name of the image.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>read-only</b> <u>NAME</u> [<u>BOOL</u>]
           Marks or (unmarks) a container or VM image read-only. Takes a VM or container image name, followed by
           a boolean as arguments. If the boolean is omitted, positive is implied, i.e. the image is marked
           read-only.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>remove</b> <u>NAME</u>...
           Removes one or more container or VM images. The special image ".host", which refers to the host's own
           directory tree, may not be removed.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>set-limit</b> [<u>NAME</u>] <u>BYTES</u>
           Sets the maximum size in bytes that a specific container or VM image, or all images, may grow up to
           on disk (disk quota). Takes either one or two parameters. The first, optional parameter refers to a
           container or VM image name. If specified, the size limit of the specified image is changed. If
           omitted, the overall size limit of the sum of all images stored locally is changed. The final
           argument specifies the size limit in bytes, possibly suffixed by the usual K, M, G, T units. If the
           size limit shall be disabled, specify "-" as size.

           Note that per-container size limits are only supported on btrfs file systems.

           Added in version 220.

       <b>clean</b>
           Remove hidden VM or container images (or all). This command removes all hidden machine images from
           /var/lib/machines/, i.e. those whose name begins with a dot. Use <b>machinectl</b> <b>list-images</b> <b>--all</b> to see
           a list of all machine images, including the hidden ones.

           When combined with the <b>--all</b> switch removes all images, not just hidden ones. This command
           effectively empties /var/lib/machines/.

           Note that commands such as <b>importctl</b> <b>pull-tar</b> or <b>importctl</b> <b>pull-raw</b> usually create hidden, read-only,
           unmodified machine images from the downloaded image first, before cloning a writable working copy of
           it, in order to avoid duplicate downloads in case of images that are reused multiple times. Use
           <b>machinectl</b> <b>clean</b> to remove old, hidden images created this way.

           Added in version 230.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--property=</b>
           When showing machine or image properties, limit the output to certain properties as specified by the
           argument. If not specified, all set properties are shown. The argument should be a property name,
           such as "Name". If specified more than once, all properties with the specified names are shown.

           Added in version 206.

       <b>--value</b>
           When printing properties with <b>show</b>, only print the value, and skip the property name and "=".

           Added in version 230.

       <b>-P</b>
           Equivalent to <b>--value</b> <b>--property=</b>, i.e. shows the value of the property without the property name or
           "=". Note that using <b>-P</b> once will also affect all properties listed with <b>-p</b>/<b>--property=</b>.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
           When showing machine or image properties, show all properties regardless of whether they are set or
           not.

           When listing VM or container images, do not suppress images beginning in a dot character (".").

           When cleaning VM or container images, remove all images, not just hidden ones.

           Added in version 206.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--full</b>
           Do not ellipsize process tree entries or table. This implies <b>--max-addresses=full</b>.

           Added in version 206.

       <b>--kill-whom=</b>
           When used with <b>kill</b>, choose which processes to kill. Must be one of <b>leader</b>, or <b>all</b> to select whether
           to kill only the leader process of the machine or all processes of the machine. If omitted, defaults
           to <b>all</b>.

           Added in version 206.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--signal=</b>
           When used with <b>kill</b>, choose which signal to send to selected processes. Must be one of the well-known
           signal specifiers such as <b>SIGTERM</b>, <b>SIGINT</b> or <b>SIGSTOP</b>. If omitted, defaults to <b>SIGTERM</b>.

           The special value "help" will list the known values and the program will exit immediately, and the
           special value "list" will list known values along with the numerical signal numbers and the program
           will exit immediately.

       <b>--uid=</b>
           When used with the <b>shell</b> command, chooses the user ID to open the interactive shell session as. If
           the argument to the <b>shell</b> command also specifies a user name, this option is ignored. If the name is
           not specified in either way, "root" will be used by default. Note that this switch is not supported
           for the <b>login</b> command (see below).

           Added in version 225.

       <b>-E</b> <u>NAME</u><b>[=</b><u>VALUE</u><b>]</b>, <b>--setenv=</b><u>NAME</u><b>[=</b><u>VALUE</u><b>]</b>
           When used with the <b>shell</b> command, sets an environment variable for the executed shell. This option
           may be used more than once to set multiple variables. When "=" and <u>VALUE</u> are omitted, the value of
           the variable with the same name in the program environment will be used.

           Note that this option is not supported for the <b>login</b> command.

           Added in version 230.

       <b>--mkdir</b>
           When used with <b>bind</b>, creates the destination file or directory before applying the bind mount. Note
           that even though the name of this option suggests that it is suitable only for directories, this
           option also creates the destination file node to mount over if the object to mount is not a
           directory, but a regular file, device node, socket or FIFO.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>--read-only</b>
           When used with <b>bind</b>, creates a read-only bind mount.

           When used with <b>clone</b> a read-only container or VM image is created.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--lines=</b>
           When used with <b>status</b>, controls the number of journal lines to show, counting from the most recent
           ones. Takes a positive integer argument. Defaults to 10.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output=</b>
           When used with <b>status</b>, controls the formatting of the journal entries that are shown. For the
           available choices, see <b><a href="../man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl</a></b>(1). Defaults to "short".

           Added in version 219.

       <b>--runner=nspawn</b>|<b>vmspawn</b>
           When operating on machines choose whether to use <b><a href="../man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/systemd-vmspawn.1.html">systemd-vmspawn</a></b>(1). By default
           <b><a href="../man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn</a></b>(1) is used.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>-V</b>
           <b>-V</b> is a shorthand for <b>--runner=vmspawn</b>.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--now</b>
           When used with <b>enable</b> or <b>disable</b>, the containers will also be started or powered off. The start or
           poweroff operation is only carried out when the respective enable or disable operation has been
           successful.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>--force</b>
           Replace target file when copying files.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>--max-addresses=</b>
           When used with the <b>list-machines</b> command, limits the number of IP addresses shown for every machine.
           Defaults to 1. All addresses can be requested with "all". If the limit is 0, the address column is
           not shown. Otherwise, if the machine has more addresses than shown, "..."  follows the last address.

           Added in version 232.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Suppresses additional informational output while running.

           Added in version 236.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--host=</b>
           Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a username and hostname separated by "@", to
           connect to. The hostname may optionally be suffixed by a port ssh is listening on, separated by ":",
           and then a container name, separated by "/", which connects directly to a specific container on the
           specified host. This will use SSH to talk to the remote machine manager instance. Container names may
           be enumerated with <b>machinectl</b> <b>-H</b> <u>HOST</u>. Put IPv6 addresses in brackets.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--machine=</b>
           Connect to <b><a href="../man8/systemd-machined.service.8.html">systemd-machined.service</a></b>(8) running in a local container, to perform the specified
           operation within the container.

           Added in version 235.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       <b>--no-legend</b>
           Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer with hints.

       <b>--no-ask-password</b>
           Do not query the user for authentication for privileged operations.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

</pre><h4><b>MACHINE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>machinectl</b> tool operates on machines and images whose names must be chosen following strict rules.
       Machine names must be suitable for use as hostnames following a conservative subset of DNS and UNIX/Linux
       semantics. Specifically, they must consist of one or more non-empty label strings, separated by dots. No
       leading or trailing dots are allowed. No sequences of multiple dots are allowed. The label strings may
       only consist of alphanumeric characters as well as the dash and underscore. The maximum length of a
       machine name is 64 characters.

       A special machine with the name ".host" refers to the running host system itself. This is useful for
       execution operations or inspecting the host system as well. Note that <b>machinectl</b> <b>list</b> will not show this
       special machine unless the <b>--all</b> switch is specified.

       Requirements on image names are less strict, however, they must be valid UTF-8, must be suitable as file
       names (hence not be the single or double dot, and not include a slash), and may not contain control
       characters. Since many operations search for an image by the name of a requested machine, it is
       recommended to name images in the same strict fashion as machines.

       A special image with the name ".host" refers to the image of the running host system. It hence
       conceptually maps to the special ".host" machine name described above. Note that <b>machinectl</b> <b>list-images</b>
       will not show this special image either, unless <b>--all</b> is specified.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b></h4><pre>
       Machine images are preferably stored in /var/lib/machines/, but are also searched for in
       /usr/local/lib/machines/ and /usr/lib/machines/. For compatibility reasons, the directory
       /var/lib/container/ is searched, too. Note that images stored below <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> are always considered
       read-only. It is possible to symlink machines images from other directories into /var/lib/machines/ to
       make them available for control with <b>machinectl</b>.

       Note that some image operations are only supported, efficient or atomic on btrfs file systems.

       Disk images are understood by <b><a href="../man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn</a></b>(1) and <b>machinectl</b> in three formats:

       •   A simple directory tree, containing the files and directories of the container to boot.

       •   Subvolumes (on btrfs file systems), which are similar to the simple directories, described above.
           However, they have additional benefits, such as efficient cloning and quota reporting.

       •   "Raw" disk images, i.e. binary images of disks with a GPT or MBR partition table. Images of this type
           are regular files with the suffix ".raw".

       See <b><a href="../man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn</a></b>(1) for more information on image formats, in particular its <b>--directory=</b> and <b>--image=</b>
       options.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Example</b> <b>1.</b> <b>Download</b> <b>an</b> <b>Ubuntu</b> <b>RAW</b> <b>image,</b> <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>root</b> <b>password</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> <b>start</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>service</b>

           # importctl pull-raw -mN \
                 https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/jammy/current/jammy-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk-kvm.img \
                 jammy
           # systemd-firstboot --image=/var/lib/machines/jammy.raw --prompt-root-password --force
           # machinectl start jammy
           # machinectl login jammy

       This downloads the specified .raw image and makes it available under the local name "jammy". Then, a root
       password is set with <b><a href="../man1/systemd-firstboot.1.html">systemd-firstboot</a></b>(1). Afterwards the machine is started as system service. With the
       last command a login prompt into the container is requested.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL</u>
           The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a higher log level, i.e. less important
           ones, will be suppressed). Takes a comma-separated list of values. A value may be either one of (in
           order of decreasing importance) <b>emerg</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>crit</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>debug</b>, or an integer
           in the range 0...7. See <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3) for more information. Each value may optionally be prefixed with
           one of <b>console</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>kmsg</b> or <b>journal</b> followed by a colon to set the maximum log level for that
           specific log target (e.g.  <b>SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug,console:info</b> specifies to log at debug level
           except when logging to the console which should be at info level). Note that the global maximum log
           level takes priority over any per target maximum log levels.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be colored according to priority.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the terminal, because <b><a href="../man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl</a></b>(1)
           and other tools that display logs will color messages based on the log level on their own.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME</u>
           A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed with a timestamp.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the terminal or a file, because
           <b><a href="../man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl</a></b>(1) and other tools that display logs will attach timestamps based on the entry metadata on
           their own.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename and line number in the source code
           where the message originates.

           Note that the log location is often attached as metadata to journal entries anyway. Including it
           directly in the message text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TID</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with the current numerical thread ID (TID).

           Note that the this information is attached as metadata to journal entries anyway. Including it
           directly in the message text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET</u>
           The destination for log messages. One of <b>console</b> (log to the attached tty), <b>console-prefixed</b> (log to
           the attached tty but with prefixes encoding the log level and "facility", see <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3), <b>kmsg</b> (log to
           the kernel circular log buffer), <b>journal</b> (log to the journal), <b>journal-or-kmsg</b> (log to the journal if
           available, and to kmsg otherwise), <b>auto</b> (determine the appropriate log target automatically, the
           default), <b>null</b> (disable log output).

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_RATELIMIT_KMSG</u>
           Whether to ratelimit kmsg or not. Takes a boolean. Defaults to "true". If disabled, systemd will not
           ratelimit messages written to kmsg.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u>
           Pager to use when <b>--no-pager</b> is not given; overrides <u>$PAGER</u>. If neither <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> nor <u>$PAGER</u> are
           set, a set of well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></b>(1),
           until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting this
           environment variable to an empty string or the value "cat" is equivalent to passing <b>--no-pager</b>.

           Note: if <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set, <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> (as well as <u>$PAGER</u>) will be silently
           ignored.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LESS</u>
           Override the options passed to <b>less</b> (by default "FRSXMK").

           Users might want to change two options in particular:

           <b>K</b>
               This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when Ctrl+C is pressed. To allow <b>less</b> to
               handle Ctrl+C itself to switch back to the pager command prompt, unset this option.

               If the value of <u>$SYSTEMD_LESS</u> does not include "K", and the pager that is invoked is <b>less</b>, Ctrl+C
               will be ignored by the executable, and needs to be handled by the pager.

           <b>X</b>
               This option instructs the pager to not send termcap initialization and deinitialization strings
               to the terminal. It is set by default to allow command output to remain visible in the terminal
               even after the pager exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager functionality from working, in
               particular paged output cannot be scrolled with the mouse.

           Note that setting the regular <u>$LESS</u> environment variable has no effect for <b>less</b> invocations by
           systemd tools.

           See <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) for more discussion.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET</u>
           Override the charset passed to <b>less</b> (by default "utf-8", if the invoking terminal is determined to be
           UTF-8 compatible).

           Note that setting the regular <u>$LESSCHARSET</u> environment variable has no effect for <b>less</b> invocations by
           systemd tools.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, the "secure" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled.
           If <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the
           same as the owner of the login session, see <b><a href="../man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid</a></b>(2) and <b><a href="../man3/sd_pid_get_owner_uid.3.html">sd_pid_get_owner_uid</a></b>(3). In secure mode,
           <b>LESSSECURE=1</b> will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or
           create new files or start new subprocesses. When <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set at all, pagers which
           are not known to implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) implements secure
           mode.)

           Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for example under <b><a href="../man8/sudo.8.html">sudo</a></b>(8) or <b><a href="../man1/pkexec.1.html">pkexec</a></b>(1),
           care must be taken to ensure that unintended interactive features are not enabled. "Secure" mode for
           the pager may be enabled automatically as describe above. Setting <u>SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0</u> or not
           removing it from the inherited environment allows the user to invoke arbitrary commands. Note that if
           the <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> or <u>$PAGER</u> variables are to be honoured, <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> must be set too. It
           might be reasonable to completely disable the pager using <b>--no-pager</b> instead.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_COLORS</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, <b>systemd</b> and related utilities will use colors in their output,
           otherwise the output will be monochrome. Additionally, the variable can take one of the following
           special values: "16", "256" to restrict the use of colors to the base 16 or 256 ANSI colors,
           respectively. This can be specified to override the automatic decision based on <u>$TERM</u> and what the
           console is connected to.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_URLIFY</u>
           The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should be generated in the output for
           terminal emulators supporting this. This can be specified to override the decision that <b>systemd</b> makes
           based on <u>$TERM</u> and other conditions.
