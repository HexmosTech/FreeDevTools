</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sa-awl - examine and manipulate SpamAssassin's auto-welcomelist db

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sa-awl</b> [--clean] [--dry-run] [--min n] [dbfile]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Check or clean a SpamAssassin auto-welcomelist (AWL) database file.

       The name of the file is specified after any options, as "dbfile".  The default is
       "$HOME/.spamassassin/auto-welcomelist".

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --clean
           Clean  out  infrequently-used AWL entries.  The "--min" switch can be used to select the threshold at
           which entries are kept or deleted.

       --dry-run
           When specified with th "--clean" option it displays the infrequently-used AWL entries  that  will  be
           deleted. The "--min" switch can be used to select the threshold at which entries are kept or deleted.

       --min n
           Select  the threshold at which entries are kept or deleted when "--clean" is used.  The default is 2,
           so entries that have only been seen once are deleted.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The output looks like this:

            AVG  (TOTSCORE/COUNT)  --  EMAIL|ip=IPBASE

       For example:

            0.0         (0.0/7)  --  <a href="mailto:dawson@example.com">dawson@example.com</a>|ip=208.192
           21.8        (43.7/2)  --  <a href="mailto:mcdaniel_2s2000@example.com">mcdaniel_2s2000@example.com</a>|ip=200.106

       "AVG" is the average score;  "TOTSCORE" is the total score of all mails seen  so  far;   "COUNT"  is  the
       number of messages seen from that sender;  "EMAIL" is the sender's email address, and "IPBASE" is the <b>AWL</b>
       <b>base</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address</b>.

       <b>AWL</b>  <b>base</b>  <b>IP</b>  <b>address</b>  is  a  way  to  identify the sender's IP address they frequently send from, in an
       approximate way, but remaining hard for spammers to spoof.  The algorithm is as follows:

         - take the last Received header that contains a public IP address -- namely
           one which is not in private, unrouted IP space.

         - chop off the last two octets, assuming that the user may be in an ISP's
           dynamic address pool.
