       output - Yagi-Uda project antenna display program

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>output</b> [ <b>-</b> <b>cehps</b> ] [ <b>-E</b><u>E_max</u> ] [ <b>-H</b><u>Hmax</u> ] [ <b>-r</b><u>minimum</u> ] [ <b>-R</b><u>maximum</u> ] [ <b>-Z</b><u>Zo</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  <u>output</u>  is  one  of  a  number of executable programs that forms part of a set of programs,
       collectively known as the <u>Yagi-Uda</u> <u>project</u> , which were designed for analysis and optimisation  of  Yagi-
       Uda  antennas.   <u>output</u>  calculates  the  gain,  FB ratio, input impedance etc etc of an antenna that was
       described by the program <u>input</u> or <u>first</u> and has had the element currents calculated with the program <u>yagi</u>
       The data about the forward gain, VSWR, FB ratio, input impedance etc is written to  a  file  <u>filename.dat</u>
       Angular data, giving the variation of gain with theta and phi is put into a file <u>filename.gai</u>
       Sometimes  the  program  fails  to  find  the  3dB bandwidths in the E and H planes, and bombs out with a
       'zbrent' error. This can occur if:
       (1) The antenna has an almost isotropic pattern, in which case its never 3dB down, so the  3dB  point  is
       undefined.
       (2) The 3dB point is outside the assumed angular range.  You then have to either:
       (a) Calculate with the -e option, which avoids calculation of the 3dB E-plane beamwidth or
       (b)  Do  (a) above, then find approximately where the 3dB point is (from the .gai file - see later), then
       set options -E and -H so the program calculates them properly.

       The DOS .EXE files as distributed require a 387 maths coprocessor to be present and will not run  without
       it.  A 486, Pentium, and I assume later processors of this series will run it without any extra hardware.
       The DOS files are no longer being maintained, so are out of sync with the latest source.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>     Calculate the maximum level of any sidelobe - not just the rear on as the FB ratio  tells  us.  If
              the  sidelobe  and  FB  ratio  are  equal,  it  means the biggest sidelobe is the rear one. If the
              Sidelobe is less than the FB ratio, then another lobe is more significant. Look in the '.gai' file
              (see below) to see where it is. This option slows the program quite a bit.

       <b>-e</b>     Suppress calculation of the 3dB E-plane bandwidth. This is sometimes necessary if the programme is
              unable to find the 3 dB beamwidth, to prevent an error occuring.

       <b>-h</b>     Suppress calculation of the 3dB H-plane bandwidth. This is sometimes necessary if the programme is
              unable to find the 3 dB beamwidth, to prevent an error occuring.

       <b>-p</b>     Put data into a file filename.freq for reading into gnuplot, and a commmand file  filename.gc  for
              gnuplot to use. (run 'output -p filename' then 'gnuplot filename.gc' )

       <b>-s</b>     Suppress all diagnostic output. By default, the program print the percentage of the job completed.

       <b>-E</b><u>E_max</u>
              When  the  program  computes the E-plane 3dB beamwidth, it assumes the antenna pattern is 3dB down
              somewhere in the range 90 to Emax, where E_max is by default 179 degrees. This can fail if  it  is
              never  3dB  down  in  the  range,  or if it happened to go 3dB down in two or more points. You can
              change E_max, if you need to, but rarely if every should need to. I've never seen a failure  here,
              but  are  guarding  against  one.  If you don't want the pattern, use the -e option instead, which
              skips it. See also '-H' below.

       <b>-H</b><u>H_max</u>
              When the program computes the H-plane 3dB beamwidth, it assumes the antenna pattern  is  3dB  down
              somewhere  in  the  range  0 to Hmax, where H_max is by defualt 60 degrees. This can fail if it is
              never 3dB down in the range, or if it happended to go 3dB down in two or more points. Also, if  it
              goes  more  than 3dB down, but that starts to come up again. You can change H_max, if you need to,
              as failures do occasionally occur. If you don't want the pattern use -h option instead, which will
              skip it.
              An obvious example of an antenna where you cant find the 3dB bandwidth for the H-plane is the 1ele
              dipole. The radiation is symmetrical about its axis, so the level is the same everywhere in the  H
              plane. The program automatically avoids calculating it for a 1 ele beam.

       <b>-Z</b><u>Zo</u>   Zo  is  the  characteristic impedance used when calculating the VSWR. By default it's 50 Ohms, but
              can be changed to any real, positive value.

        <u>filename</u>
              is the name of the file containing the antenna description. It is  expected  to  be  in  a  format
              created  by  <u>input</u> or <u>first</u> - two other programs in the <u>Yagi-Uda</u> <u>project.</u>  The is also expected to
              exist a binary file <u>filename.out</u> created by typing <u>yagi</u> <u>filename</u>

</pre><h4><b>Limitations</b></h4><pre>
       I'm not aware of any limitations, apart from  that  filenames,  including  full  path,  can't  exceed  90
       characters.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       filename        ASCII file with antenna description.
       filename.out    Binary data file, created by yagi.
       filename.dat    ASCII file with gain, FB ratio etc.
       filename.gai    ASCII file with angular dependence of gain.

</pre><h4><b>PLATFORMS</b></h4><pre>
       Both  DOS  and Unix versions have been built. The DOS version as distributed requires a 386 PC with a 387
       maths coprocessor.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Bugs should be reported to <b><a href="mailto:david.kirkby@onetel.net">david.kirkby@onetel.net</a></b>.  Bugs tend actually  to  be  fixed  if  they  can  be
       isolated, so it is in your interest to report them in such a way that they can be easily reproduced.  The
       program  gives  errors  if  element  lengths  are well away from a half-wave (by a factor of ~3) due to a
       breakdown in the equations.  If the input file is edited manually and  done  incorrectly,  there  can  be
       unpredictable results.
