</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       first - Yagi-Uda project quick antenna builder

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>first</b> filename  elements f_min f_design f_max f_step diameter

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  <b>first</b>  is  one  of  a  number  of executable programs that forms part of a set of programs,
       collectively known as the <u>Yagi-Uda</u> <u>project</u> , which were designed for analysis and optimisation  of  Yagi-
       Uda  antennas.   <u>first</u>  is  used  to  define an antenna quickly, if you are not interested in analysing a
       specific design (in which case use <u>input</u> ) but need to get a design that is half-way reasonable  so  that
       it  may  be  optimised.  It  is  much  faster  in  use  (since its not interactive) than <u>input</u> The design
       methodology that <u>first</u> is the DL6WU antenna designs, which are valid for 10 or  more  elements,  although
       <u>first</u>  will  calculate for any number of elements. DL6WU reccomends a folded dipole, but the designs here
       are for a simple dipole, since I don't yet know how to calculate the self and mutual impedances of folded
       dipoles.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Filenames, including full path, can't exceed 90 characters.

       Does not take into account the variation of impedance of a dipole with change in  wavelength/diameter  of
       elements.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       filename          Yagi description, created by first.
       filename.out      Binary data file, created by yagi.
       filename.dat      Performance of antenna, created by output.
       filename.gai      Gain of antenna, created by output.

       The  DOS .EXE files as distributed require a 387 maths coprocessor to be present and will not run without
       it. A 486, Pentium, and I assume later processors of this series will run it without any extra hardware.

</pre><h4><b>PLATFORMS</b></h4><pre>
       Both DOS and and Unix versions have been built. The DOS version as distributed requires a 386 PC  with  a
       387 maths coprocessor. The DOS version is no longer being developed, so the DOS executables included with
       the distribution are not upto date with the current source code.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       Dr.  David  Kirkby  G8WRB  (<a href="mailto:david.kirkby@onetel.net">david.kirkby@onetel.net</a>).   with  help  with  the  conversion  to  the DOS/PC
       environment from Dr. Joe Mack NA3T (<a href="mailto:mack@fcrfv2.ncifcrf.gov">mack@fcrfv2.ncifcrf.gov</a>)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Bugs should be reported to: David Kirkby G8WRB (<a href="mailto:david.kirkby@onetel.net">david.kirkby@onetel.net</a>).  Bugs tend actually to be fixed
       if they can be isolated, so it is in your interest to report them in such a way that they can  be  easily
       reproduced.

       If the input file is edited manually and done incorrectly, there can be unpredictable results.

       Options are not checked for sensible numbers. A negative length can be entered!
