</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       s3qllock - Make trees on an S3QL file system immutable

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          s3qllock [options] &lt;directory&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       S3QL  is  a  file  system  for  online  data  storage.  Before  using S3QL, make sure to consult the full
       documentation (rather than just the man  pages  which  only  briefly  document  the  available  userspace
       commands).

       The  <b>s3qllock</b>  command  makes  a  directory tree in an S3QL file system immutable. Immutable trees can no
       longer be changed in any way whatsoever. You can not add new files or directories and you can not  change
       or  delete  existing  files  and  directories. The only way to get rid of an immutable tree is to use the
       <b>s3qlrm</b> command.

       <b>s3qllock</b> can only be called by the user that mounted the file system and (if the file system was  mounted
       with <b>--allow-other</b> or <b>--allow-root</b>) the root user.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Immutability  is  a  feature designed for backups. Traditionally, backups have been made on external tape
       drives. Once a backup was made, the tape drive was removed and locked away somewhere. This means that the
       contents of the backup are permanently fixed. Nothing (short  of  physical  destruction)  can  change  or
       delete files in the backup.

       In  contrast,  when  backing  up into an online storage system like S3QL, all backups are available every
       time the file system is mounted.  Nothing prevents a file in an old backup from being changed again later
       on. In the worst case, this may make your entire backup system worthless. Imagine that your  system  gets
       infected  by a virus that simply deletes all files it can find -- if the virus is active while the backup
       file system is mounted, the virus will destroy all backups together with the originals.

       Even in the absence of malware,, being able to change a backup after it has been made is generally not  a
       good idea. A common S3QL use case is to keep the file system mounted at all times and periodically create
       backups  with  <b>rsync</b> <b>-a</b>. This allows every user to recover her files from a backup without having to call
       the system administrator. However, this also allows every user to accidentally change or delete files  <u>in</u>
       one of the old backups.

       Making a backup immutable protects you against all these problems.  Unless you happen to run into a virus
       that  was specifically programmed to attack S3QL file systems, backups can be neither deleted nor changed
       after they have been made immutable.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>s3qllock</b> command accepts the following options:

          <b>--log</b> <u>&lt;target&gt;</u>
                 Destination for log messages. Specify <b>none</b> for standard output or <b>syslog</b> for the system logging
                 daemon. Anything else will be interpreted as a file name. Log files will be rotated  when  they
                 reach 1 MiB, and at most 5 old log files will be kept. Default: <b>None</b>

          <b>--debug-modules</b> <u>&lt;modules&gt;</u>
                 Activate  debugging  output  from  specified  modules (use commas to separate multiple modules,
                 'all' for everything). Debug messages will be written to the  target  specified  by  the  <b>--log</b>
                 option.

          <b>--debug</b>
                 Activate  debugging  output from all S3QL modules. Debug messages will be written to the target
                 specified by the <b>--log</b> option.

          <b>--quiet</b>
                 be really quiet

          <b>--version</b>
                 just print program version and exit

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>s3qllock</b> may terminate with the following exit codes:

       <b>0</b>      Everything went well.

       <b>1</b>      An unexpected error occurred. This may indicate a bug in the program.

       <b>2</b>      Invalid command line argument or configuration file key.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The S3QL homepage is at <u>https://github.com/s3ql/s3ql/</u>.

       The full S3QL documentation should also be installed somewhere  on  your  system,  common  locations  are
       <b>/usr/share/doc/s3ql</b> or <b>/usr/local/doc/s3ql</b>.
