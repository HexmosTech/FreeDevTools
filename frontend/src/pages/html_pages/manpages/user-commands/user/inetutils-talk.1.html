</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       talk — talk to another user

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>talk</b> <u>person</u> [<u>ttyname</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Talk</b> is a visual communication program which copies lines from your terminal to that of another user.

       Options available:

       <u>person</u>   If you wish to talk to someone on your own machine, then <u>person</u> is just the person's login name.
                If you wish to talk to a user on another host, then <u>person</u> is of the form ‘user@host’.

       <u>ttyname</u>  If  you wish to talk to a user who is logged in more than once, the <u>ttyname</u> argument may be used
                to indicate the appropriate terminal name, where <u>ttyname</u> is of the form ‘ttyXX’.

       When first called, <b>talk</b> sends the message
             Message from TalkDaemon@his_machine...
             talk: connection requested by your_name@your_machine.
             talk: respond with: talk your_name@your_machine

       to the user you wish to talk to. At this point, the recipient of the message should reply by typing

             <b>talk</b>  <b>your_name@your_machine</b>

       It doesn't matter from which machine the recipient replies, as long as his login-name is the same.   Once
       communication  is  established,  the  two parties may type simultaneously, with their output appearing in
       separate windows.  Typing control-L ‘^L’ will cause the screen to be reprinted, while your  erase,  kill,
       and  word  kill  characters will behave normally.  To exit, just type your interrupt character; <b>talk</b> then
       moves the cursor to the bottom of the screen and restores the terminal to its previous state.

       Permission to talk may be denied or granted by use of the <u><a href="../man1/mesg.1.html">mesg</a></u>(1) command.   At  the  outset  talking  is
       allowed.  Certain commands, in particular <u><a href="../man1/nroff.1.html">nroff</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/pr.1.html">pr</a></u>(1), disallow messages in order to prevent messy
       output.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></u>
                  to find the recipient's machine
       <u><a href="file:/run/utmp">/run/utmp</a></u>  to find the recipient's tty

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man1/mail.1.html">mail</a></u>(1), <u><a href="../man1/mesg.1.html">mesg</a></u>(1), <u><a href="../man1/who.1.html">who</a></u>(1), <u><a href="../man1/write.1.html">write</a></u>(1)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  version  of <u><a href="../man1/talk.1.html">talk</a></u>(1) released with 4.3BSD uses a protocol that is incompatible with the protocol used
       in the version released with 4.2BSD.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>talk</b> command appeared in 4.2BSD.
