</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       upload  is  an  sos  subcommand  to upload sos reports, logs, vmcores, or other files to a policy defined
       remote location, or a user defined one.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIRED</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FILE</b>

       The path to the archive that is to be uploaded.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--case-id</b> <b>NUMBER</b>
              Specify a case identifier to associate with the archive.   Identifiers  may  include  alphanumeric
              characters, commas and periods ('.').  This applies only to Red Hat uploads.

       <b>--upload-url</b> <b>URL</b>
              If a vendor does not provide a default upload location, or if you would like to upload the archive
              to a different location, specify the address here.

              An  upload  protocol  MUST  be  specified in this URL. Currently uploading is supported for HTTPS,
              SFTP, and FTP protocols.

              If your destination server listens on a non-standard port, specify the listening port in the URL.

       <b>--upload-user</b> <b>USER</b>
              If a vendor does not provide a default user for uploading, specify the username here.

              If --batch is used and this option is omitted, no username will be collected and thus uploads will
              fail if no vendor default is set.

              You also have the option of providing this value via the SOSUPLOADUSER  environment  variable.  If
              this  variable  is  set,  then  no username prompt will occur and --batch may be used provided all
              other required values (case number, upload password) are provided.

       <b>--upload-pass</b> <b>PASS</b>
              Specify the password to use for authentication with the destination server.

              If this option is omitted and upload is requested, you will be prompted for one.

              If --batch is used, this prompt will not occur, so any uploads are  likely  to  fail  unless  this
              option is used.

              Note  that this will result in the plaintext string appearing in `ps` output that may be collected
              by sos and be in the archive. If a password must be provided by you for uploading, it is  strongly
              recommended to not use --batch and enter the password when prompted rather than using this option.

              You  also  have the option of providing this value via the SOSUPLOADPASSWORD environment variable.
              If this variable is set, then no password prompt will occur and --batch may be used  provided  all
              other required values (case number, upload user) are provided.

       <b>--upload-directory</b> <b>DIR</b>
              Specify  a directory to upload to, if one is not specified by a vendor default location or if your
              destination server does not allow writes to '/'.

       <b>--upload-method</b> <b>METHOD</b>
              Specify the HTTP method to use for uploading to the provided --upload-url. Valid values are 'auto'
              (default), 'put', or 'post'. The use of 'auto' will default to the method required by the  policy-
              default upload location, if one exists.

              This option has no effect on upload protocols other than HTTPS.

       <b>--upload-no-ssl-verify</b>
              Disable  SSL verification for HTTPS uploads. This may be used to allow uploading to locations that
              have self-signed certificates, or certificates that are otherwise untrusted by the local system.

              Default behavior is to perform SSL verification against all upload locations.

       <b>--upload-protocol</b> <b>PROTO</b>
              Manually specify the protocol to use for uploading to the target <b>upload-url</b>.

              Normally this is determined via the upload address, assuming that the  protocol  is  part  of  the
              address  provided,  e.g.  'https://example.com'.  By using this option, sos will skip the protocol
              check and use the method defined for the specified PROTO.

              For RHEL systems, setting this option to <b>sftp</b> will skip the initial attempt to upload to  the  Red
              Hat  Customer Portal, and only attempt an upload to Red Hat's SFTP server, which is typically used
              as a fallback target.

              Valid values for PROTO are: 'auto' (default), 'https', 'ftp', 'sftp', 's3'.

       <b>--upload-target</b> <b>TARGET</b>
              Manually specify the upload target to use for uploading. Possible targets are: redhat,  canonical,
              generic,  local.  If this option is not called, sos will try to determine the local target and use
              it for uploads.
