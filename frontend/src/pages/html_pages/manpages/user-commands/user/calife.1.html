</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       calife — becomes root (or another user) legally.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>calife</b> [<u>-</u>] [<u>login</u>]

              or

       <b>...</b> [<u>-</u>] [<u>login</u>] for some sites (check with your administrator).

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Calife</b>  requests  <u>user's</u> <u>own</u> password for becoming <u>login</u> (or <u>root</u>, if no login is provided), and switches
       to that user and group ID after verifying proper rights to do so.  A shell is then executed.   If  <b>calife</b>
       is executed by root, no password is requested and a shell with the appropriate user ID is executed.

       The  invoked  shell  is  the  user's  own  except  when  a  shell  is specified in the configuration file
       <b>calife.auth</b>.

       If <b>``-''</b> is specified on the command line, user's profile files are read as if it was a login shell.

       This is <b>not</b> the traditional behavior of <b>su</b>.

       Only users specified in <b>calife.auth</b> can use <b>calife</b> to become another one with this method.

       You can specify in the <b>calife.auth</b> file the list of logins allowed for  users  when  using  <b>calife</b>.   See
       <u><a href="../man5/calife.auth.5.html">calife.auth</a></u>(5) for more details.

       <b>calife.auth</b> is installed as <u>/etc/calife.auth</u>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/calife.auth</u>  List of users authorized to use <b>calife</b> and the users they can become.
       <u>/etc/calife.out</u>   This script is executed just after getting out of <b>calife</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  original  environment  is  kept.  This is <b>not</b> a security problem as you have to be yourself at login
       (i.e. it does not have the same security implications as in <u><a href="../man1/su.1.html">su</a></u>(1) ).

       Environment variables used by <b>calife</b>:

       HOME  Default home directory of real user ID.

       PATH  Default search path of real user ID unless modified as specified above.

       TERM  Provides terminal type which may be retained for the substituted user ID.

       USER  The user ID is always the effective ID (the target user ID) after an <b>su</b> unless the  user  ID  is  0
             (root).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  MD5-based  <u><a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt</a></u>(3) function is slower and probably stronger than the DES-based one but it is usable
       only among FreeBSD 2.0+ systems.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       A <b>calife</b> command appeared in DG/UX, written for Antenne 2 in 1991. It has evolved considerably since this
       period with more OS support, user lists handling and improved logging.

       PAM support was introduced in 2005 to port it to MacOS X variants (Panther and up).
