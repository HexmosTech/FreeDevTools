       ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Zwrite</u> sends a message from you to another user through the <u><a href="../man1/zephyr.1.html">zephyr</a>(1)</u>  notification  service.   The  user
       must have subscribed to messages of the appropriate class and instance using the <u><a href="../man1/zctl.1.html">zctl</a>(1)</u> program.

       <u>Zwrite</u> understands the following options.

       <b>-a</b>          Causes   <u>zwrite</u>   to   send   the  message  authenticated,  using  <u>Kerberos</u>  to  perform  the
                   authentication.  This is the default.

       <b>-d</b>          Causes <u>zwrite</u> to send the message unauthenticated.

       <b>-v</b>          Causes <u>zwrite</u> to print what type of message  it  is  sending,  and  whether  or  not  it  was
                   successful.

       <b>-q</b>          Forces <u>zwrite</u> to suppress information about whether or not the message was sent.

       <b>-t</b>          Prevents  <u>zwrite</u> from expanding tabs in the message into appropriate spaces.  Normally <u>zwrite</u>
                   will expand any tabs it finds into the appropriate number of spaces  to  maintain  separation
                   based on 8-character tab stops.

       <b>-l</b>          Causes  <u>zwrite</u>  to  ignore  `.' on a line by itself in the input and only end a typed message
                   when the user types the end-of-file character (usually control-D).  When the input is  not  a
                   terminal, this is the default action.

       <b>-u</b>          Sends an urgent message.  This changes the <u>zephyr</u> instance of the message to ``URGENT''.

       <b>-o</b>          Causes  <u>zwrite</u>  to  ignore  the Zephyr variables <u>zwrite-class</u>, <u>zwrite-inst</u>, and <u>zwrite-opcode</u>
                   when picking a default class, instance, and opcode.

       <b>-n</b>          prevents <u>zwrite</u> from sending a PING  message  to  verify  the  recipient  is  subscribing  to
                   messages.   By  default,  <u>zwrite</u>  will  send a notice to the destination class, instance, and
                   recipient, with opcode ``PING'' before sending the message.  If the PING  is  sent,  and  the
                   server  response  indicates  there are no recipients subscribed to your message, <u>zwrite</u> exits
                   without sending a message.  When the <b>-n</b> option is used, no PING is sent.

       <b>-C</b>          prepends a "CC:" line to the body of the message indicating the recipients  of  the  message.
                   This is strictly a convenience: the presence of a "CC:" line at the top of a zephyr body does
                   not  necessarily  indicate  that this option was used, or that the message really was sent to
                   the listed users, and its lack doesn't indicate that the message was  not  sent  to  multiple
                   users.

       <b>-U</b>          Send an unacked message.  <u>zwrite</u> will not wait for acknowledgement that the message was sent,
                   nor will it issue a PING before sending.

       <b>-s</b> <u>signature</u>
                   sets  the  signature  to be included in the message.  This overrides both the user's name (as
                   found in the password  file)  and  any  setting  of  the  Zephyr  variable  <u>zwrite-signature</u>.
                   <u>signature</u> must be a single argument, hence when using a shell it should be quoted with double
                   quotes.  A <u>signature</u> argument of "" leaves the signature in the message empty.

       <b>-c</b> <u>class</u>    Allows a user to specify a different class for the message.  This allows a message to be sent
                   to  a large group of people with some degree of security.  See <u><a href="../man1/zephyr.1.html">zephyr</a>(1)</u> and <u><a href="../man8/zephyrd.8.html">zephyrd</a>(8)</u> for a
                   description of how to restrict access to classes.  When this option is specified, the message
                   is sent to recipient "*" unless an additional list of recipients is specified.
                   This argument may not be used in conjunction with the -f option.

       <b>-i</b> <u>instance</u> Allows a user to specify a different instance than the default.  When this  option  is  used,
                   the  message  is  sent to recipient "*" unless an additional list of recipients is specified.
                   This allows a message to be sent to a large group of people (e.g. a development  group)  just
                   by  having  the members subscribe to messages of class "MESSAGE", the specified instance, and
                   recipient "*".
                   This argument may not be used in conjunction with the -f option.

       <b>-r</b> <u>realm</u>    Allows a user to specify a different realm for the message, if the server supports interrealm
                   Zephyr.

       <b>-S</b> <u>sender</u>   Specify a sender.  The message will be sent unauthenticated.

       <b>-F</b> <u>format</u>   Allows a user to specify a different default format for the message.

       <b>-O</b> <u>opcode</u>   Allows a user to specify a different opcode for the  message.   Some  Zephyr  notice  display
                   programs may use the opcode to decide how to display a notice.

       <b>-f</b> <u>arg</u>      Allows  a  user  to specify an argument to be interpreted as a filesystem specification.  The
                   class is set to <b>FILSRV</b>.  he instance is set to <u>arg</u> as modified: If  <u>arg</u>  contains  no  colons
                   (`:'),  it  is  assumed to be a host name, and it is converted into an official host name via
                   <u><a href="../man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname</a>(3).</u>  If <u>arg</u> contains a colon, the portion preceding the colon is treated  as  a
                   host  name,  and  the colon and any trailing characters are appended to the offical host name
                   returned by <u>gethostbyname.</u>  If the name fails to resolve into  an  official  host  name,  the
                   instance is set to <u>arg</u> unmodified.
                   This option may not be used in conjunction with the -c or -i option.

       <b>-m</b>          <u>Zwrite</u> sends the remaining arguments on the command line as the message.

       If  the  <u>-m</u> option is not specified, the user is prompted for the message to be sent.  The message may be
       terminated by typing ^D or ``.'' on a line by itself.

       The default class for messages is ``MESSAGE'', the  default  instance  is  ``PERSONAL'',  andthe  default
       opcode  is  ``''  (an  empty  string).   These defaults can be overridden by setting the Zephyr variables
       <u>zwrite-class</u>, <u>zwrite-inst</u>, and  <u>zwrite-opcode</u>,  respectively.   Command-line  options  can  override  the
       defaults.

       If  the  class  is ``MESSAGE'' and the instance is either ``PERSONAL'' or ``URGENT'', a recipient must be
       specified.  These comparisons are case-sensitive.

       Unless the <b>-s</b> option is used, the contents of the Zephyr variable <u>zwrite-signature</u> are  used  to  augment
       the  user's  username in the message.  If <u>zwrite-signature</u> is not set and the <b>-s</b> option is not specified,
       the user's full name (as specified in the password file) is used instead.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tab expansion should really be done by the receiver of the message.
       The -u option is provided for compatibility with old versions of <u>zwrite</u> and is not necessarily useful for
       sending messages to users who do not have old subscription files.
