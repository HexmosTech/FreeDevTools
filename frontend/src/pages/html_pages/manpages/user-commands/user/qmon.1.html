</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       qmon - X-Windows OSF/Motif graphical user interface for Grid Engine

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>qmon</b> [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Qmon</u>  allows  administrators and users to manipulate the Grid Engine system from an X-Window environment.
       <u>Qmon</u> provides various dialogues linked together in multiple ways.  For  each  task  the  user  wishes  to
       accomplish  via  <u>qmon</u> a corresponding dialogue is provided. There are multiple ways to address the proper
       dialogue for a certain task:

       •  The <u>qmon</u>  main  window  that  comes  up  first  on  start-up  contains  icon  buttons  for  all  major
          administrative  and  user  tasks.  A functionality tooltip is displayed when pointing at the different
          icons.

       •  A <b>Task</b> pulldown menu button appears in the <u>qmon</u> main window menu bar. Clicking on it opens a  list  of
          available tasks. Selecting one of them opens the corresponding dialogue.

       •  The  <b>Task</b>  pulldown  menu  also  contains  the  key  accelerators which can be used to invoke the task
          dialogues directly from the main window by pressing a certain sequence on the keyboard.

       •  While navigating through a certain dialogue and its dialogue sub-hierarchy, links to  other  dialogues
          occur  whenever  a connection between both dialogues is obvious. Pushing the buttons that identify the
          links opens up the other dialogues.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The supported options are  the  standard  X  Toolkit  options  as  described  in  <u><a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a></u>(1)  section  <b>Options</b>.
       Furthermore, <u>qmon</u> supports:

       <b>-cmap</b>  Installs  a  private  color  map  for  <u>qmon</u>.   This is sometimes useful if other applications have
              already allocated lots of colors and if <u>qmon</u>, therefore prints corresponding error messages. <b>Note</b>,
              however, that using a private color map will result in color map switches whenever  you  enter  or
              leave <u>qmon</u> windows.

       <b>-fontFamily</b> <b>{big|medium|small}</b>
              Notifies <u>qmon</u> to use different size font families for different resolution sizes.

       <b>-help</b>  Displays usage information.

       <b>-nologo</b>
              Startup without logo.

</pre><h4><b>DIALOGUES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Job</b> <b>Control</b>
       The  <b>Job</b> <b>Control</b> dialogue provides a folder of tabulated lists of the still pending jobs, already running
       jobs and recently finished jobs.  The dialogue allows for detailed information on the jobs as well as for
       the deletion and suspension of jobs being selected.  In addition the job control dialogue offers links to
       the <b>Submit</b> dialogue in order to submit new jobs or to change attributes of pending jobs (<b>Qalter</b>  button).
       The  fields  displayed  in  the  tabular display and the jobs displayed can be customized by pressing the
       <b>Customize</b> button. This customization can be  saved  to  the  <u><a href="file:~/.qmon_preferences">~/.qmon_preferences</a></u>  file  and  is  used  on
       following startup for the initial configuration of the <b>Job</b> <b>Control</b> dialogue.

   <b>Queue</b> <b>Control</b>
       The  <b>Queue</b> <b>Control</b> dialogue with its sub-dialogue hierarchy enables the user to control the status of the
       Grid Engine queues actually configured in the system and allows the administrator to add new queues or to
       modify or delete existing ones. The <b>Queue</b> <b>Control</b> dialogue shows a tabbed view of Cluster Queues or their
       corresponding Queue Instances in a tabular way.

       By pushing the <b>Add</b>, <b>Clone</b> or <b>Modify</b> button, a sub-dialogue for configuring Grid Engine queues is  opened.
       A queue needs to be selected to use the clone and modify operation. The configuration sub-dialogue allows
       for  definition  of  the  queue and its attributes.  The configuration sub-dialogue contains in the upper
       section the queue name and a list of hosts or hostgroups for which this queue contains the configuration.
       The lower section contains a list of hosts or hostgroups at the left, where the  default  attributes  are
       shown  when  the  "@/" entry is highlighted.  These default attributes can be overruled on a hostgroup or
       host basis by enabling attributes and changing their values after this hostgroup or host entry  has  been
       added  in  the  "Attributes  for  Host/Hostgroup"  listbox.   The  queue  configuration  parameters  (see
       <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5)) are subdivided  into  different  categories  (<b>General</b>  <b>Configuration</b>,  <b>Execution</b>  <b>Methods</b>,
       <b>Checkpointing</b>,  <b>Load/Suspend</b>  <b>Thresholds</b>,  <b>Limits</b>,  <b>Complexes</b>,  <b>User</b>  <b>Access</b>, <b>Project</b> <b>Access,</b> <b>Subordinate</b>
       <b>Queues,</b> <b>Owners)</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab</b> <b>widget</b> <b>area</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>region</b>  <b>of</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>queue</b>
       <b>configuration</b>  <b>sub-dialogue.</b>   <b>The</b>  <b>administrator</b>  <b>may</b> <b>select</b> <b>previously-configured</b> <b>settings</b> <b>from</b> <b>already</b>
       <b>existing</b> <b>queues</b>  <b>(Clone</b>  <b>button).</b>  <b>By</b>  <b>pushing</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>Ok</b>  <b>button,</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>definitions</b>  <b>are</b>  <b>registered</b>  <b>with</b>
       <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8).   The  <b>Queue</b>  <b>Control</b>  dialogue  can  be  customized  in a similar way as the <b>Job</b> <b>Control</b>
       dialogue. The settings applied here are also saved in <u><a href="file:~/.qmon_preferences">~/.qmon_preferences</a></u>.

   <b>Submit</b>
       The <b>Job</b> <b>Submission</b> dialogue serves for submitting batch and interactive jobs and  is  also  invoked  when
       changing  attributes  of  pending  jobs from the <b>Job</b> <b>Control</b> dialogue explained above (<b>Qalter</b> button). To
       toggle between batch and interactive jobs please use the <b>Batch/Interactive</b>  button  at  the  top  of  the
       button column on the right side of the <b>Job</b> <b>Submission</b> screen.

       The dialogue consists of a folder containing two job preparation dialogue pages. The most frequently used
       parameters  in  the  course  of  a job submission are offered on the <b>General</b> page. A job script has to be
       defined; all other fields are optional. If the job demands specification of  advanced  requirements,  the
       <b>Advanced</b> tab can be used to switch to an enhanced parameter display.

       If  resource  requirements are mandatory for the job, the <b>Request</b> <b>Resources</b> icon button has to be used to
       pop up the <b>Requested</b> <b>Resources</b> sub-dialogue.  This sub-dialogue allows  for  selection  of  the  required
       resources of the job and for definition of the quantities in which this resources are to be provided. The
       <b>Available</b>  <b>Resources</b>  are  constituted from those complex attributes declared <u>requestable</u> (see <u><a href="../man5/complex.5.html">complex</a></u>(5)
       for details). Resource requirements can be made <b>Hard</b>, i.e. they must be met before a job can  be  started
       in a queue, or <b>Soft</b>, i.e. they are granted on an as-available basis.

       Closing the <b>Requested</b> <b>Resources</b> sub-dialogue with the done button books the specified requirement for the
       job. Pushing the <b>Submit</b> button on the top level <b>Submit</b> dialogue submits the job.

   <b>Complex</b> <b>Config</b>
       The <b>Complex</b> <b>Config</b> allows the administrator to add new complex attributes or to modify or delete existing
       ones  (see  <u><a href="../man5/complex.5.html">complex</a></u>(5)).   The  complex  configuration  dialogue provides a tabulated list of the complex
       attribute entries and an input region for the declaration of new or  modified  entries.  The  <b>Add</b>  button
       updates the tabulated list with a new attribute.  The <b>Modify</b> button changes a highlighted existing entry.
       The  <b>Delete</b>  button  removes  the  highlighted  attributes.   The  <b>Load</b>  <b>and</b> <b>Save</b> buttons allow saving or
       reloading the whole attribute list to or from file.  The <b>Ok</b> button registers the additional  or  modified
       complex attributes with <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8).

   <b>Host</b> <b>Config</b>
       Four types of host related lists can be maintained via the <b>Host</b> <b>Config</b> dialogue:

              Administration Hosts
              Submit Hosts
              Host Groups
              Execution Hosts

       The  host  list  to be manipulated is selected via clicking at one of the tabs named correspondingly. The
       first two host lists only provide for adding or deleting  entries,  thereby  allowing  administrative  or
       submit  permission for the hosts on the lists, or denying it otherwise respectively.  The host group list
       allows the manipulation of host groups. Host groups can reference either other host groups or hosts.  The
       execution host list entries in addition provide the ability  to  define  scaling  factors  for  the  load
       sensors, consumable complex attributes and access attributes (access, xaccess and projects, xprojects) as
       described  in  <u><a href="../man5/complex.5.html">complex</a></u>(5).  CPU, memory and I/O usage reported for running jobs can be scaled in addition
       and the relative performance of  a  host  can  be  defined  with  the  <b>Resource</b>  <b>Capability</b>  <b>Factor</b>  (see
       <u><a href="../man5/host_conf.5.html">host_conf</a></u>(5)).

   <b>Cluster</b> <b>Config</b>
       This  dialogue  maintains  the  cluster  global  configuration  as well as host specific derivatives (see
       <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5)).  When opened,  the  dialogue  displays  a  selection  list  for  all  hosts  which  have  a
       configuration  assigned. The special name "global" refers to the cluster global configuration. By pushing
       the  <b>Add/Modify</b>  button  a  sub-dialogue  is  opened,  which  allows  for  modification  of  the  cluster
       configuration.  For  host specific configurations the 'global' host specific configuration fields are set
       insensitive and only the allowed parameters can be manipulated.

   <b>Scheduler</b> <b>Config</b>
       The <b>Scheduler</b> <b>Configuration</b> dialogue provides the means  to  change  the  behavior  of  the  Grid  Engine
       scheduler  thread  part  of  <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8)  process.   The  dialogue  contains  a representation for all
       scheduler configuration parameters as described in <u><a href="../man5/sched_conf.5.html">sched_conf</a></u>(5).  It is subdivided in the  two  sections
       <b>General</b> <b>Parameters</b> and <b>Load</b> <b>Adjustments</b>, which can be selected via the corresponding tabs.  The <b>Ok</b> button
       registers any changes with <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8).

   <b>Calendar</b> <b>Config</b>
       The  <b>Calendar</b>  <b>Config</b>  allows the administrator to add new calendars or to modify or delete existing ones
       (see <u><a href="../man5/calendar_conf.5.html">calendar_conf</a></u>(5)).  The dialogue offers a selection list for the existing calendars and displays the
       configuration of the one being selected. By pushing the <b>Delete</b> button, the selected calendar  is  deleted
       from  the configuration. Pushing the <b>Add</b>/<b>Modify</b> button will open a calendar configuration dialogue, which
       allows to create new calendars or which provides the means to change the existing  ones.  The  <b>Ok</b>  button
       registers the additional or modified calendar with <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8).

   <b>User</b> <b>Config</b>
       User  permissions are controlled via the <b>User</b> <b>Config</b> dialogue.  The tab widget in the left section of the
       dialogue allows for selecting between

              Configuration of <b>Manager</b> accounts.
              Configuration of <b>Operator</b> accounts.
              Definition of <b>Usersets</b>.
              Definition of <b>User</b> accounts.

       Those user accounts added to the list of manager or operator accounts are  given  permission  to  act  as
       managers or operators respectively when accessing Grid Engine under their own account.

       The  userset lists are used together with the <b>user_lists</b> and <b>xuser_lists</b> host, queue, project and cluster
       configuration parameters (see <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5), <u><a href="../man5/project.5.html">project</a></u>(5) and <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5)) to control access  of  users  to
       hosts,  queues,  projects  and the entire cluster.  A userset is just a collection of user names and UNIX
       group names. Group names are identified by prefixing them with a "@" sign. The  already-defined  usersets
       are  displayed  in a selection list. These lists can be modified, and new lists can be created, using the
       <b>Userset</b> definition dialogue.

       Usersets can be used as <b>Access</b> <b>List</b> and/or as <b>Department</b> required for the so called <b>Functional</b> <b>Policy</b> and
       <b>Override</b> <b>Policy</b> (see <b>Ticket</b> <b>Config</b> below).

       User names can be added to the system as entries to the Grid Engine user database (see <u><a href="../man5/user.5.html">user</a></u>(5));  here  a
       default project can be attached to the user too.  This can be done with the <b>User</b> sub-dialogue.

       The  <b>Tickets</b> button in the button list on the right side of the dialogue opens the <b>Ticket</b> <b>Config</b> dialogue
       (see below).

   <b>PE</b> <b>Config</b>
       Parallel environment (PE) interfaces can be configured with this dialogue.  PE interfaces  are  necessary
       to  describe  how  parallel  programming  environments  like PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine), MPI (Message
       Passing Interface), or shared memory parallel systems, are  to  be  instantiated  and  to  impose  access
       restrictions  onto  the  PEs.  When  the  dialogue  is  opened a list of the configured PEs is displayed,
       together with the current configuration (see <u><a href="../man5/sge_pe.5.html">sge_pe</a></u>(5)) of the selected PE  interface.   To  add  new  PE
       interfaces,  or  to  modify  existing  ones,  an  <b>Add</b>  and  a <b>Modify</b> button are available which open a PE
       interface configuration sub-dialogue. After applying the changes and quitting this sub-dialogue with  the
       <b>OK</b> button, the new or modified PE interface is registered with <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8).

   <b>Checkpoint</b> <b>Config</b>
       Checkpointing  environment  interfaces  can be configured with this dialogue.  Checkpointing environments
       are necessary to describe the attributes which the different checkpointing methods and their  derivatives
       on  various  operating system platforms supported by Grid Engine have. When the dialogue is opened a list
       of the already configured checkpointing environments is displayed together with the current configuration
       (see <u><a href="../man5/checkpoint.5.html">checkpoint</a></u>(5)) of the selected checkpointing environment. To add new checkpointing environments,  or
       to  modify existing ones, an <b>Add</b> and a <b>Modify</b> button is available which opens a checkpointing environment
       configuration sub-dialogue. After applying the changes and quitting this sub-dialogue with the <b>OK</b> button,
       the new or modified checkpointing environment is registered with <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8).

   <b>Ticket</b> <b>Conf</b>
       This dialogue offers an overview and editing screen for allocating tickets to the share-based, functional
       and override scheduling policies.

       The <b>Deadline</b> <b>Job</b> button opens the <b>User</b> <b>Conf</b> dialogue box.  Please change to the Userset sub-dialogue  and
       select the userset named "deadlineusers".  Only users of this userset may submit deadline jobs.

       The  <b>Share</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>Policy</b> button opens the dialogue for creating and editing the Grid Engine share tree (see
       <u><a href="../man5/share_tree.5.html">share_tree</a></u>(5) and <u><a href="../man5/sched_conf.5.html">sched_conf</a></u>(5) for a description of the configuration parameters).

       The <b>Functional</b> <b>Policy</b> button opens the dialogue for creating and editing the allocation of the functional
       shares (see <u><a href="../man5/sched_conf.5.html">sched_conf</a></u>(5), <u><a href="../man5/access_list.5.html">access_list</a></u>(5), <u><a href="../man5/project.5.html">project</a></u>(5), <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5) and <u><a href="../man5/user.5.html">user</a></u>(5) for a description of the
       different types of functional shares and the configurable weighting parameters).

       The <b>Override</b> <b>Policy</b> button opens the dialogue for creating and editing the allocation of override tickets
       (see <u><a href="../man5/access_list.5.html">access_list</a></u>(5), <u><a href="../man5/project.5.html">project</a></u>(5), <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5) and <u><a href="../man5/user.5.html">user</a></u>(5) for a description of the  different  types  of
       override tickets).

   <b>Project</b> <b>Conf</b>
       This button opens a dialog for creating projects.
       The  dialogue offers a selection list for the existing projects and displays the configuration of the one
       being selected. By pushing the <b>Delete</b> button, the selected project is  deleted  from  the  configuration.
       Pushing  the  <b>Add</b>/<b>Modify</b>  button  will  open  a project configuration dialogue, which allows creating new
       projects changing existing ones. Project configuration in essence means giving or  denying  access  to  a
       project for usersets (see <b>User</b> <b>Conf</b> above as well as <u><a href="../man5/project.5.html">project</a></u>(5)).  The Ok button registers the additional
       or modified project with <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8).

   <b>Browser</b>
       The  <b>Object</b>  <b>Browser</b> dialogue's purpose is manifold: First of all, Grid Engine and <u>qmon</u> Messages, such as
       notification of error or success concerning a previously taken action, can be displayed in the dialogue's
       output window.  Also the standard output and the standard error output of <u>qmon</u> can  be  diverted  to  the
       <b>Object</b> <b>Browser</b> output window.

       Additionally  the  <b>Object</b> <b>Browser</b> can be used to display continuous information about Grid Engine objects
       as the mouse pointer moves over their representation as icons or table entries in other  <u>qmon</u>  dialogues.
       Currently,  only the display of the configuration of two Grid Engine objects in two separate dialogues is
       supported:

       •  Queue configurations are displayed as soon as the mouse pointer enters a queue icon in the  top  level
          <b>Queue</b>  <b>Control</b>  dialogue  (see  above).  This facility is activated by pushing the <b>Queue</b> button in the
          <b>Object</b> <b>Browser</b> dialogue.

       •  Detailed job information is printed as soon as the user moves the mouse pointer over a line in the <b>Job</b>
          <b>Control</b> dialogue (see above) assigned to a running or pending job.

       •  Additionally job scheduling information is displayed in the browser if the  <b>Why?</b>  button  in  the  <b>Job</b>
          <b>Control</b> dialogue is pressed. In this case the Browser dialogue is opened implicitly and any scheduling
          related information is displayed.

   <b>Exit</b>
       The  <b>Exit</b>  icon  button  is  not  linked  with  a  dialogue. Its sole purpose is to close all active <u>qmon</u>
       dialogues and to exit the application.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       The available resources, their meaning and the syntax  to  be  followed  in  order  to  modify  them  are
       described in the default <u>qmon</u> resource file (see the section <b>Files</b> below for the location of the resource
       file).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SGE_ROOT</b>       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard configuration files.

       <b>SGE_CELL</b>       If  set,  specifies  the default Grid Engine cell. To address a Grid Engine cell <u>qmon</u> uses
                      (in the order of precedence):

                      The name of the cell specified in the environment variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                      The name of the default cell, i.e. <b>default</b>.

       <b>SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</b>
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be written  to  stderr.  In  addition  the
                      level of detail in which debug information is generated is defined.

       <b>SGE_QMASTER_PORT</b>
                      If  set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which  <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8)  is  expected to listen for
                      communication requests.  Most installations will use  a  services  map  entry  instead  to
                      define that port.

       <b>SGE_LOAD_AVG</b>   Specify  a  load  parameter  (see  <u><a href="../man5/load_parameters.5.html">load_parameters</a></u>(5))  to  use  instead  of <b>load_avg</b> when
                      displaying/selecting load values.

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If the line to be entered in an editing window is longer than the width of the window, then the text just
       runs off the end of the window.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>&lt;sge_root&gt;/qmon/Qmon</u>           <u>Qmon</u> sample resources file
       <u>/usr/lib/X11/defaults/Qmon</u>     <u>Qmon</u> system resources file
