</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       whowatch - console, interactive, process and users monitoring tool.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Whowatch</b> is an console, interactive users and process monitoring tool.  It displays information about the
       users  currently  logged on to the machine, in real-time.  Besides standard information (login name, tty,
       host, user's process), the type of the connection (ie. telnet or ssh) is shown.  Display of users command
       line can be switch to tty idle time.  Certain user can be selected and his processes tree may  be  viewed
       as well as tree of all system processes. Tree may be displayed with additional column that shows owner of
       each  process.   In  the process tree mode SIGINT, SIGHUP, SIGTERM and SIGKILL signals can be sent to the
       selected process. Killing processes is just as simple and fun as deleting lines on the screen.

       <b>Whowatch</b> has no command line options or configuration file.  All actions are performed in  real  time  by
       pressing following keys:

       Users list mode:

       <b>'up'</b> <b>'down'</b>
              cursor movement

       <b>'i'</b>    toggle between user command line and idle time

       <b>'c'</b>    full  command  line  on/off.  Disabling full command line can save CPU time.  It can give you also
              some additional information about process executable.

       <b>'enter'</b>
              view selected user's processes tree.

       <b>'t'</b>    all system processes (init tree)

       Tree mode:

       <b>'up'</b> <b>'down'</b>
              cursor movement

       <b>'enter'</b>
              go back to users list

       <b>'o'</b>    show processes owners

       <b>'c'</b>    full command line on/off. Disabling full command line can save CPU time.  It  can  give  you  also
              some additional information about process executable.

       <b>'Ctrl-I'</b>
              send INT signal to selected process

       <b>'Ctrl-K'</b>
              send KILL signal to selected process

       <b>'Ctrl-U'</b>
              send HUP signal to selected process

       <b>'Ctrl-T'</b>
              send TERM signal to selected process

</pre><h4><b>PLUGINS</b></h4><pre>
       Whowatch has ability to load plugin during program run.  Plugin prints information inside details window.
       Plugins  gives  flexibility:  if  some  specific information about process, user or system is needed then
       separate program could be written to obtain such information.  Since there are  three  kinds  of  deatils
       window  (process,  user and system) maximum three plugins can be loaded.  Whowatch has very simple API to
       write plugins.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Program reads <u><a href="file:/var/log/wtmp">/var/log/wtmp</a></u>, <u><a href="file:/var/run/utmp">/var/run/utmp</a></u>. Under Linux program also reads files  from  <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u>  directory.
       Without read access to these files <b>whowatch</b> funcionality will be limited or program will not even start.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Because  lack  of  ut_pid  in  utmp and wtmp structures in *BSD systems, program tries to obtain pid of a
       login shell by analyzing processes controlling terminal and processes names. Under some conditions it may
       lead to incorrect results ie. there will be incorrect processes tree associated with user's session.
