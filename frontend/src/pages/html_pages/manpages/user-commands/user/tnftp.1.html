</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tnftp</b>  is  the user interface to the Internet standard File Transfer Protocol.  The program allows a user
       to transfer files to and from a remote network site.

       The last five arguments will fetch a file using the FTP or HTTP protocols, or by direct copying, into the
       current directory.   This  is  ideal  for  scripts.   Refer  to  “AUTO-FETCHING  FILES”  below  for  more
       information.

       Options may be specified at the command line, or to the command interpreter.

       <b>-4</b>          Forces <b>tnftp</b> to only use IPv4 addresses.

       <b>-6</b>          Forces <b>tnftp</b> to only use IPv6 addresses.

       <b>-A</b>          Force  active  mode FTP.  By default, <b>tnftp</b> will try to use passive mode FTP and fall back to
                   active mode if passive is not supported by the server.  This option causes  <b>tnftp</b>  to  always
                   use  an  active connection.  It is only useful for connecting to very old servers that do not
                   implement passive mode properly.

       <b>-a</b>          Causes <b>tnftp</b> to bypass normal login procedure, and use an anonymous login instead.

       <b>-d</b>          Enables debugging.

       <b>-e</b>          Disables command line editing.  This is useful for Emacs ange-ftp mode.

       <b>-f</b>          Forces a cache reload for transfers that go through the FTP or HTTP proxies.

       <b>-g</b>          Disables file name globbing.

       <b>-i</b>          Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.

       <b>-N</b> <u>netrc</u>    Use <u>netrc</u> instead of <u><a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a></u>.  Refer to “THE .netrc FILE” for more information.

       <b>-n</b>          Restrains <b>tnftp</b> from attempting “auto-login”  upon  initial  connection  for  non  auto-fetch
                   transfers.   If  auto-login  is  enabled, <b>tnftp</b> will check the <u>.netrc</u> (see below) file in the
                   user's home directory for an entry describing an account on the remote machine.  If no  entry
                   exists,  <b>tnftp</b> will prompt for the remote machine login name (default is the user identity on
                   the local machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a password and an  account  with  which  to
                   login.   To  override  the  auto-login  for  auto-fetch  transfers, specify the username (and
                   optionally, password) as appropriate.

       <b>-o</b> <u>output</u>   When auto-fetching files, save the contents in <u>output</u>.  <u>output</u> is  parsed  according  to  the
                   “FILE  NAMING  CONVENTIONS” below.  If <u>output</u> is not ‘<b>-</b>’ or doesn't start with ‘<b>|</b>’, then only
                   the first file specified will be retrieved into <u>output</u>; all other  files  will  be  retrieved
                   into the basename of their remote name.

       <b>-P</b> <u>port</u>     Sets the port number to <u>port</u>.

       <b>-p</b>          Enable passive mode operation for use behind connection filtering firewalls.  This option has
                   been  deprecated  as  <b>tnftp</b>  now tries to use passive mode by default, falling back to active
                   mode if the server does not support passive connections.

       <b>-q</b> <u>quittime</u>
                   Quit if the connection has stalled for <u>quittime</u> seconds.

       <b>-R</b>          Restart all non-proxied auto-fetches.

       <b>-r</b> <u>wait</u>     Retry the connection attempt if it failed, pausing for <u>wait</u> seconds.

       <b>-s</b> <u>srcaddr</u>  Uses <u>srcaddr</u> as the local IP address for all connections.

       <b>-t</b>          Enables packet tracing.

       <b>-T</b> <u>direction</u><b>,</b><u>maximum</u>[<b>,</b><u>increment</u>]
                   Set the maximum transfer rate for <u>direction</u> to <u>maximum</u> bytes/second, and  if  specified,  the
                   increment to <u>increment</u> bytes/second.  Refer to <b>rate</b> for more information.

       <b>-u</b> <u>url</u> <u>file</u> <u>...</u>
                   Upload  files  on  the  command  line  to  <u>url</u>  where <u>url</u> is one of the ‘ftp://’ URL types as
                   supported by auto-fetch (with an optional target filename for single file uploads), and  <u>file</u>
                   is one or more local files to be uploaded.

       <b>-V</b>          Disable <b>verbose</b> and <b>progress</b>, overriding the default of enabled when output is to a terminal.

       <b>-v</b>          Enable <b>verbose</b> and <b>progress</b>.  This is the default if output is to a terminal (and in the case
                   of  <b>progress</b>,  <b>tnftp</b> is the foreground process).  Forces <b>tnftp</b> to show all responses from the
                   remote server, as well as report on data transfer statistics.

       <b>-x</b> <u>xfersize</u>
                   Set the size of the socket send and receive buffers to <u>xfersize</u>.  Refer to <b>xferbuf</b>  for  more
                   information.

       <b>-?</b>          Display help to stdout, and exit.

       The  client  host  with  which  <b>tnftp</b> is to communicate may be specified on the command line.  If this is
       done, <b>tnftp</b> will immediately attempt to establish a connection to an FTP server on that host;  otherwise,
       <b>tnftp</b>  will  enter  its command interpreter and await instructions from the user.  When <b>tnftp</b> is awaiting
       commands from the user the prompt ‘ftp&gt;’ is provided to the user.  The following commands are  recognized
       by <b>tnftp</b>:

       <b>!</b> [<u>command</u> [<u>args</u>]]
                   Invoke an interactive shell on the local machine.  If there are arguments, the first is taken
                   to be a command to execute directly, with the rest of the arguments as its arguments.

       <b>$</b> <u>macro-name</u> [<u>args</u>]
                   Execute  the macro <u>macro-name</u> that was defined with the <b>macdef</b> command.  Arguments are passed
                   to the macro unglobbed.

       <b>account</b> [<u>passwd</u>]
                   Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system for access  to  resources  once  a
                   login has been successfully completed.  If no argument is included, the user will be prompted
                   for an account password in a non-echoing input mode.

       <b>append</b> <u>local-file</u> [<u>remote-file</u>]
                   Append a local file to a file on the remote machine.  If <u>remote-file</u> is left unspecified, the
                   local  file  name is used in naming the remote file after being altered by any <b>ntrans</b> or <b>nmap</b>
                   setting.  File transfer uses the current settings for <b>type</b>, <b>format</b>, <b>mode</b>, and <b>structure</b>.

       <b>ascii</b>       Set the file transfer <b>type</b> to network ASCII.  This is the default type.

       <b>bell</b>        Arrange that a bell be sounded after each file transfer command is completed.

       <b>binary</b>      Set the file transfer <b>type</b> to support binary image transfer.

       <b>bye</b>         Terminate the FTP session with the remote server and exit <b>tnftp</b>.  An end of  file  will  also
                   terminate the session and exit.

       <b>case</b>        Toggle  remote computer file name case mapping during <b>get</b>, <b>mget</b> and <b>mput</b> commands.  When <b>case</b>
                   is on (default is off), remote computer file names with all letters in upper case are written
                   in the local directory with the letters mapped to lower case.

       <b>cd</b> <u>remote-directory</u>
                   Change the working directory on the remote machine to <u>remote-directory</u>.

       <b>cdup</b>        Change the remote machine working directory to the  parent  of  the  current  remote  machine
                   working directory.

       <b>chmod</b> <u>mode</u> <u>remote-file</u>
                   Change the permission modes of the file <u>remote-file</u> on the remote system to <u>mode</u>.

       <b>close</b>       Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and return to the command interpreter.  Any
                   defined macros are erased.

       <b>cr</b>          Toggle  carriage return stripping during ascii type file retrieval.  Records are denoted by a
                   carriage return/linefeed sequence during ascii type  file  transfer.   When  <b>cr</b>  is  on  (the
                   default),  carriage  returns  are stripped from this sequence to conform with the Unix single
                   linefeed record delimiter.  Records on non-Unix remote systems may contain single  linefeeds;
                   when  an  ascii  type  transfer  is  made, these linefeeds may be distinguished from a record
                   delimiter only when <b>cr</b> is off.

       <b>debug</b> [<u>debug-value</u>]
                   Toggle debugging mode.  If an optional <u>debug-value</u>  is  specified  it  is  used  to  set  the
                   debugging level.  When debugging is on, <b>tnftp</b> prints each command sent to the remote machine,
                   preceded by the string ‘--&gt;’.

       <b>delete</b> <u>remote-file</u>
                   Delete the file <u>remote-file</u> on the remote machine.

       <b>dir</b> [<u>remote-path</u> [<u>local-file</u>]]
                   Print  a  listing of the contents of a directory on the remote machine.  The listing includes
                   any system-dependent information that the server chooses to include; for example,  most  Unix
                   systems  will  produce  output from the command ‘ls -l’.  If <u>remote-path</u> is left unspecified,
                   the current working directory is used.  If interactive prompting is on, <b>tnftp</b> will prompt the
                   user to verify that the last argument is indeed the  target  local  file  for  receiving  <b>dir</b>
                   output.   If  no  local file is specified, or if <u>local-file</u> is ‘<b>-</b>’, the output is sent to the
                   terminal.

       <b>disconnect</b>  A synonym for <b>close</b>.

       <b>edit</b>        Toggle command line editing, and context sensitive command  and  file  completion.   This  is
                   automatically enabled if input is from a terminal, and disabled otherwise.

       <b>epsv</b>, <b>epsv4</b>, <b>epsv6</b>
                   Toggle  the  use of the extended EPSV and EPRT commands on all IP, IPv4, and IPv6 connections
                   respectively.  First try EPSV/EPRT, and then PASV/PORT.  This is enabled by default.   If  an
                   extended  command fails then this option will be temporarily disabled for the duration of the
                   current connection, or until <b>epsv</b>, <b>epsv4</b>, or <b>epsv6</b> is executed again.

       <b>exit</b>        A synonym for <b>bye</b>.

       <b>features</b>    Display what features the remote server supports (using the FEAT command).

       <b>fget</b> <u>localfile</u>
                   Retrieve the files listed in <u>localfile</u>, which has one line per filename.

       <b>form</b> <u>format</u>
                   Set the  file  transfer  <b>form</b>  to  <u>format</u>.   The  default  (and  only  supported)  format  is
                   ‘non-print’.

       <b>ftp</b> <u>host</u> [<u>port</u>]
                   A synonym for <b>open</b>.

       <b>gate</b> [<u>host</u> [<u>port</u>]]
                   Toggle  gate-ftp  mode,  which used to connect through the TIS FWTK and Gauntlet FTP proxies.
                   This will not be permitted if the gate-ftp server hasn't been set (either explicitly  by  the
                   user, or from the FTPSERVER environment variable).  If <u>host</u> is given, then gate-ftp mode will
                   be enabled, and the gate-ftp server will be set to <u>host</u>.  If <u>port</u> is also given, that will be
                   used as the port to connect to on the gate-ftp server.

       <b>get</b> <u>remote-file</u> [<u>local-file</u>]
                   Retrieve  the  <u>remote-file</u>  and store it on the local machine.  If the local file name is not
                   specified, it is given the same name it has on the remote machine, subject to  alteration  by
                   the  current <b>case</b>, <b>ntrans</b>, and <b>nmap</b> settings.  The current settings for <b>type</b>, <b>form</b>, <b>mode</b>, and
                   <b>structure</b> are used while transferring the file.

       <b>glob</b>        Toggle filename expansion for <b>mdelete</b>, <b>mget</b>, <b>mput</b>, and <b>mreget</b>.  If  globbing  is  turned  off
                   with  <b>glob</b>,  the file name arguments are taken literally and not expanded.  Globbing for <b>mput</b>
                   is done as in <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1).  For <b>mdelete</b>, <b>mget</b>, and <b>mreget</b>,  each  remote  file  name  is  expanded
                   separately on the remote machine and the lists are not merged.  Expansion of a directory name
                   is  likely  to  be different from expansion of the name of an ordinary file: the exact result
                   depends on the foreign operating system and FTP server, and can be previewed  by  doing  ‘<b>mls</b>
                   <b>remote-files</b>  <b>-</b>’.   Note:  <b>mget</b>,  <b>mput</b>  and <b>mreget</b> are not meant to transfer entire directory
                   subtrees of files.  That can be done by transferring a <u><a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a></u>(1)  archive  of  the  subtree  (in
                   binary mode).

       <b>hash</b> [<u>size</u>]
                   Toggle  hash-sign  (‘#’)  printing for each data block transferred.  The size of a data block
                   defaults to 1024 bytes.  This can be changed by specifying  <u>size</u>  in  bytes.   Enabling  <b>hash</b>
                   disables <b>progress</b>.

       <b>help</b> [<u>command</u>]
                   Print  an  informative  message about the meaning of <u>command</u>.  If no argument is given, <b>tnftp</b>
                   prints a list of the known commands.

       <b>idle</b> [<u>seconds</u>]
                   Set the inactivity timer on the remote server to <u>seconds</u> seconds.  If <u>seconds</u> is omitted, the
                   current inactivity timer is printed.

       <b>image</b>       A synonym for <b>binary</b>.

       <b>lcd</b> [<u>directory</u>]
                   Change the working directory on the local machine.  If no <u>directory</u> is specified, the  user's
                   home directory is used.

       <b>less</b> <u>file</u>   A synonym for <b>page</b>.

       <b>lpage</b> <u>local-file</u>
                   Display <u>local-file</u> with the program specified by the <b>set</b> <b>pager</b> option.

       <b>lpwd</b>        Print the working directory on the local machine.

       <b>ls</b> [<u>remote-path</u> [<u>local-file</u>]]
                   A synonym for <b>dir</b>.

       <b>macdef</b> <u>macro-name</u>
                   Define  a  macro.   Subsequent  lines  are  stored  as  the  macro  <u>macro-name</u>;  a  null line
                   (consecutive newline characters in a file or carriage returns from the  terminal)  terminates
                   macro  input  mode.   There  is a limit of 16 macros and 4096 total characters in all defined
                   macros.  Macro names can be a maximum of 8 characters.  Macros are  only  applicable  to  the
                   current  session  they  are  defined  within (or if defined outside a session, to the session
                   invoked with the next <b>open</b> command), and remain defined until a <b>close</b>  command  is  executed.
                   To invoke a macro, use the <b>$</b> command (see above).

                   The macro processor interprets ‘$’ and ‘\’ as special characters.  A ‘$’ followed by a number
                   (or  numbers) is replaced by the corresponding argument on the macro invocation command line.
                   A ‘$’ followed by an ‘i’ signals the macro processor  that  the  executing  macro  is  to  be
                   looped.   On  the  first  pass ‘$i’ is replaced by the first argument on the macro invocation
                   command line, on the second pass it is replaced by the second argument, and  so  on.   A  ‘\’
                   followed  by  any  character  is  replaced by that character.  Use the ‘\’ to prevent special
                   treatment of the ‘$’.

       <b>mdelete</b> [<u>remote-files</u>]
                   Delete the <u>remote-files</u> on the remote machine.

       <b>mdir</b> <u>remote-files</u> <u>local-file</u>
                   Like <b>dir</b>, except multiple remote files may be specified.  If  interactive  prompting  is  on,
                   <b>tnftp</b>  will  prompt the user to verify that the last argument is indeed the target local file
                   for receiving <b>mdir</b> output.

       <b>mget</b> <u>remote-files</u>
                   Expand the <u>remote-files</u> on the remote machine and do a <b>get</b> for each file name thus  produced.
                   See  <b>glob</b> for details on the filename expansion.  Resulting file names will then be processed
                   according to <b>case</b>, <b>ntrans</b>, and <b>nmap</b> settings.  Files are transferred into the  local  working
                   directory, which can be changed with <b>lcd</b> <u>directory</u>; new local directories can be created with
                   <b>!</b> <b>mkdir</b> <u>directory</u>.

       <b>mkdir</b> <u>directory-name</u>
                   Make a directory on the remote machine.

       <b>mls</b> <u>remote-files</u> <u>local-file</u>
                   Like <b>ls</b>, except multiple remote files may be specified, and the <u>local-file</u> must be specified.
                   If  interactive  prompting is on, <b>tnftp</b> will prompt the user to verify that the last argument
                   is indeed the target local file for receiving <b>mls</b> output.

       <b>mlsd</b> [<u>remote-path</u>]
                   Display the contents of <u>remote-path</u> (which should default to the  current  directory  if  not
                   given)  in  a  machine-parsable  form, using MLSD.  The format of display can be changed with
                   ‘<b>remopts</b> <b>mlst</b> <u>...</u>’.

       <b>mlst</b> [<u>remote-path</u>]
                   Display the details about <u>remote-path</u> (which should default to the current directory  if  not
                   given)  in  a  machine-parsable  form, using MLST.  The format of display can be changed with
                   ‘<b>remopts</b> <b>mlst</b> <u>...</u>’.

       <b>mode</b> <u>mode-name</u>
                   Set the file transfer <b>mode</b> to <u>mode-name</u>.  The default (and only supported) mode is ‘stream’.

       <b>modtime</b> <u>remote-file</u>
                   Show the last modification time of the file on the remote machine, in <b>RFC</b> <b>2822</b> format.

       <b>more</b> <u>file</u>   A synonym for <b>page</b>.

       <b>mput</b> <u>local-files</u>
                   Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as arguments and do a <b>put</b> for each file in
                   the resulting list.  See <b>glob</b> for details of filename expansion.  Resulting file  names  will
                   then be processed according to <b>ntrans</b> and <b>nmap</b> settings.

       <b>mreget</b> <u>remote-files</u>
                   As per <b>mget</b>, but performs a <b>reget</b> instead of <b>get</b>.

       <b>msend</b> <u>local-files</u>
                   A synonym for <b>mput</b>.

       <b>newer</b> <u>remote-file</u> [<u>local-file</u>]
                   Get the file only if the modification time of the remote file is more recent that the file on
                   the  current  system.   If  the file does not exist on the current system, the remote file is
                   considered <b>newer</b>.  Otherwise, this command is identical to <b>get</b>.

       <b>nlist</b> [<u>remote-path</u> [<u>local-file</u>]]
                   A synonym for <b>ls</b>.

       <b>nmap</b> [<u>inpattern</u> <u>outpattern</u>]
                   Set or unset the filename mapping mechanism.  If no arguments  are  specified,  the  filename
                   mapping  mechanism  is unset.  If arguments are specified, remote filenames are mapped during
                   <b>mput</b> commands and <b>put</b> commands  issued  without  a  specified  remote  target  filename.   If
                   arguments  are  specified,  local  filenames are mapped during <b>mget</b> commands and <b>get</b> commands
                   issued without a specified local target filename.  This command is useful when connecting  to
                   a  non-Unix remote computer with different file naming conventions or practices.  The mapping
                   follows the pattern set by <u>inpattern</u> and <u>outpattern</u>.

                   <u>inpattern</u> is a template for  incoming  filenames  (which  may  have  already  been  processed
                   according to the <b>ntrans</b> and <b>case</b> settings).  Variable templating is accomplished by including
                   the  sequences ‘$1’, ‘$2’, ..., ‘$9’ in <u>inpattern</u>.  Use ‘\’ to prevent this special treatment
                   of the ‘$’ character.  All other characters are treated literally, and are used to  determine
                   the  <b>nmap</b>  [<u>inpattern</u>]  variable values.  For example, given <u>inpattern</u> ‘$1.$2’ and the remote
                   file name ‘mydata.data’, ‘$1’ would have the value ‘mydata’, and ‘$2’ would  have  the  value
                   ‘data’.

                   The <u>outpattern</u> determines the resulting mapped filename.  The sequences ‘$1’, ‘$2’, ..., ‘$9’
                   are  replaced  by  any  value  resulting  from  the <u>inpattern</u> template.  The sequence ‘$0’ is
                   replaced by the original filename.  Additionally, the sequence  <b>[</b><u>seq1</u><b>,</b><u>seq2</u><b>]</b>  is  replaced  by
                   <u>seq1</u>  if  <u>seq1</u>  is  not  a  null  string; otherwise it is replaced by <u>seq2</u>.  For example, the
                   command

                         <b>nmap</b> <b>$1.$2.$3</b> <b>[$1,$2].[$2,file]</b>

                   would  yield  the  output  filename  ‘myfile.data’  for  input  filenames  ‘myfile.data’  and
                   ‘myfile.data.old’, ‘myfile.file’ for the input filename ‘myfile’, and ‘myfile.myfile’ for the
                   input filename ‘.myfile’.  Spaces may be included in <u>outpattern</u>, as in the example:

                         <b>nmap</b> <b>$1</b> <b>sed</b> <b>s/</b>  <b>*$//</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>$1</b>

                   Use the ‘\’ character to prevent special treatment of the ‘$’, ‘[’, ‘]’, and ‘,’ characters.

       <b>ntrans</b> [<u>inchars</u> [<u>outchars</u>]]
                   Set  or  unset  the filename character translation mechanism.  If no arguments are specified,
                   the  filename  character  translation  mechanism  is  unset.   If  arguments  are  specified,
                   characters  in  remote  filenames are translated during <b>mput</b> commands and <b>put</b> commands issued
                   without a specified remote target filename.  If arguments are specified, characters in  local
                   filenames  are  translated  during  <b>mget</b> commands and <b>get</b> commands issued without a specified
                   local target filename.  This command is useful when connecting to a non-Unix remote  computer
                   with  different  file  naming  conventions or practices.  Characters in a filename matching a
                   character in <u>inchars</u> are replaced with the  corresponding  character  in  <u>outchars</u>.   If  the
                   character's  position  in  <u>inchars</u>  is  longer  than the length of <u>outchars</u>, the character is
                   deleted from the file name.

       <b>open</b> <u>host</u> [<u>port</u>]
                   Establish a connection to the specified <u>host</u> FTP server.  An  optional  port  number  may  be
                   supplied,  in  which  case, <b>tnftp</b> will attempt to contact an FTP server at that port.  If the
                   <b>set</b> <b>auto-login</b> option is on (default), <b>tnftp</b> will also attempt to automatically log the  user
                   in to the FTP server (see below).

       <b>page</b> <u>file</u>   Retrieve <b>file</b> and display with the program specified by the <b>set</b> <b>pager</b> option.

       <b>passive</b> [<b>auto</b>]
                   Toggle  passive mode (if no arguments are given).  If <b>auto</b> is given, act as if FTPMODE is set
                   to ‘auto’.  If passive mode is turned on (default), <b>tnftp</b> will send a PASV  command  for  all
                   data connections instead of a PORT command.  The PASV command requests that the remote server
                   open  a  port for the data connection and return the address of that port.  The remote server
                   listens on that port and the client connects to it.  When using  the  more  traditional  PORT
                   command,  the  client  listens  on  a  port  and sends that address to the remote server, who
                   connects back to it.  Passive mode is useful when using <b>tnftp</b> through  a  gateway  router  or
                   host that controls the directionality of traffic.  (Note that though FTP servers are required
                   to support the PASV command by <b>RFC</b> <b>1123</b>, some do not.)

       <b>pdir</b> [<u>remote-path</u>]
                   Perform <b>dir</b> [<u>remote-path</u>], and display the result with the program specified by the <b>set</b> <b>pager</b>
                   option.

       <b>pls</b> [<u>remote-path</u>]
                   Perform  <b>ls</b> [<u>remote-path</u>], and display the result with the program specified by the <b>set</b> <b>pager</b>
                   option.

       <b>pmlsd</b> [<u>remote-path</u>]
                   Perform <b>mlsd</b> [<u>remote-path</u>], and display the result with the  program  specified  by  the  <b>set</b>
                   <b>pager</b> option.

       <b>preserve</b>    Toggle preservation of modification times on retrieved files.

       <b>progress</b>    Toggle  display  of  transfer progress bar.  The progress bar will be disabled for a transfer
                   that has <u>local-file</u> as ‘<b>-</b>’ or a  command  that  starts  with  ‘|’.   Refer  to  “FILE  NAMING
                   CONVENTIONS” for more information.  Enabling <b>progress</b> disables <b>hash</b>.

       <b>prompt</b>      Toggle interactive prompting.  Interactive prompting occurs during multiple file transfers to
                   allow  the  user to selectively retrieve or store files.  If prompting is turned off (default
                   is on), any <b>mget</b> or <b>mput</b> will transfer all files, and any <b>mdelete</b> will delete all files.

                   When prompting is on, the following commands are available at a prompt:

                         <b>a</b>   Answer ‘yes’ to the current file, and automatically answer ‘yes’ to  any  remaining
                             files for the current command.

                         <b>n</b>   Answer ‘no’, and do not transfer the file.

                         <b>p</b>   Answer  ‘yes’  to  the current file, and turn off prompt mode (as if <b>prompt</b> <b>off</b> had
                             been given).

                         <b>q</b>   Terminate the current operation.

                         <b>y</b>   Answer ‘yes’, and transfer the file.

                         <b>?</b>   Display a help message.

                   Any other response will answer ‘yes’ to the current file.

       <b>proxy</b> <u>ftp-command</u>
                   Execute an FTP command on a secondary control connection.  This command  allows  simultaneous
                   connection  to  two  remote  FTP servers for transferring files between the two servers.  The
                   first <b>proxy</b> command should be an <b>open</b>, to establish the secondary control connection.   Enter
                   the  command ‘<b>proxy</b> <b>?</b>’ to see other FTP commands executable on the secondary connection.  The
                   following commands behave differently when prefaced by <b>proxy</b>: <b>open</b> will not define new macros
                   during the auto-login process, <b>close</b> will not erase existing macro definitions, <b>get</b> and  <b>mget</b>
                   transfer  files  from the host on the primary control connection to the host on the secondary
                   control connection, and <b>put</b>, <b>mput</b>, and <b>append</b> transfer files from the host on  the  secondary
                   control connection to the host on the primary control connection.  Third party file transfers
                   depend  upon  support of the FTP protocol PASV command by the server on the secondary control
                   connection.

       <b>put</b> <u>local-file</u> [<u>remote-file</u>]
                   Store a local file on the remote machine.  If <u>remote-file</u> is left unspecified, the local file
                   name is used after processing according to any <b>ntrans</b> or <b>nmap</b> settings in naming  the  remote
                   file.  File transfer uses the current settings for <b>type</b>, <b>format</b>, <b>mode</b>, and <b>structure</b>.

       <b>pwd</b>         Print the name of the current working directory on the remote machine.

       <b>quit</b>        A synonym for <b>bye</b>.

       <b>quote</b> [<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>]
                   The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote FTP server.

       <b>rate</b> <u>direction</u> [<u>maximum</u> [<u>increment</u>]]
                   Throttle  the  maximum  transfer  rate to <u>maximum</u> bytes/second.  If <u>maximum</u> is 0, disable the
                   throttle.

                   <u>direction</u> may be one of:
                         <b>all</b>  Both directions.
                         <b>get</b>  Incoming transfers.
                         <b>put</b>  Outgoing transfers.

                   <u>maximum</u> can be modified on the fly by <u>increment</u> bytes  (default:  1024)  each  time  a  given
                   signal is received:

                         SIGUSR1  Increment <u>maximum</u> by <u>increment</u> bytes.

                         SIGUSR2  Decrement <u>maximum</u> by <u>increment</u> bytes.  The result must be a positive number.

                   If <u>maximum</u> is not supplied, the current throttle rates are displayed.

                   Note: <b>rate</b> is not yet implemented for ascii mode transfers.

       <b>rcvbuf</b> <u>size</u>
                   Set the size of the socket receive buffer to <u>size</u>.

       <b>recv</b> <u>remote-file</u> [<u>local-file</u>]
                   A synonym for <b>get</b>.

       <b>reget</b> <u>remote-file</u> [<u>local-file</u>]
                   <b>reget</b>  acts  like  <b>get</b>,  except  that  if  <u>local-file</u> exists and is smaller than <u>remote-file</u>,
                   <u>local-file</u> is presumed to be a partially transferred copy of <u>remote-file</u> and the transfer  is
                   continued  from the apparent point of failure.  This command is useful when transferring very
                   large files over networks that are prone to dropping connections.

       <b>remopts</b> <u>command</u> [<u>command-options</u>]
                   Set options on the remote FTP server for <u>command</u> to <u>command-options</u> (whose absence is handled
                   on a command-specific basis).  Remote FTP commands known to  support  options  include:  MLST
                   (used for MLSD and MLST).

       <b>rename</b> [<u>from</u> [<u>to</u>]]
                   Rename the file <u>from</u> on the remote machine, to the file <u>to</u>.

       <b>reset</b>       Clear reply queue.  This command re-synchronizes command/reply sequencing with the remote FTP
                   server.   Resynchronization may be necessary following a violation of the FTP protocol by the
                   remote server.

       <b>restart</b> <u>marker</u>
                   Restart the immediately following <b>get</b> or <b>put</b> at  the  indicated  <u>marker</u>.   On  Unix  systems,
                   marker is usually a byte offset into the file.

       <b>rhelp</b> [<u>command-name</u>]
                   Request  help  from  the remote FTP server.  If a <u>command-name</u> is specified it is supplied to
                   the server as well.

       <b>rmdir</b> <u>directory-name</u>
                   Delete a directory on the remote machine.

       <b>rstatus</b> [<u>remote-file</u>]
                   With no arguments, show status of remote machine.  If <u>remote-file</u> is specified,  show  status
                   of <u>remote-file</u> on remote machine.

       <b>runique</b>     Toggle  storing of files on the local system with unique filenames.  If a file already exists
                   with a name equal to the target local filename for a <b>get</b> or <b>mget</b> command, a ‘.1’ is  appended
                   to  the name.  If the resulting name matches another existing file, a ‘.2’ is appended to the
                   original name.  If this process continues up to ‘.99’, an error message is printed,  and  the
                   transfer  does  not  take  place.  The generated unique filename will be reported.  Note that
                   <b>runique</b> will not affect local files generated from a shell command (see below).  The  default
                   value is off.

       <b>send</b> <u>local-file</u> [<u>remote-file</u>]
                   A synonym for <b>put</b>.

       <b>sendport</b>    Toggle  the  use of PORT commands.  By default, <b>tnftp</b> will attempt to use a PORT command when
                   establishing a connection for each data transfer.  The  use  of  PORT  commands  can  prevent
                   delays  when  performing  multiple file transfers.  If the PORT command fails, <b>tnftp</b> will use
                   the default data port.  When the use of PORT commands is disabled, no attempt will be made to
                   use PORT commands for each data transfer.  This is useful  for  certain  FTP  implementations
                   which do ignore PORT commands but, incorrectly, indicate they've been accepted.

       <b>set</b> [<u>option</u> <u>value</u>]
                   Set <u>option</u> to <u>value</u>.  If <u>option</u> and <u>value</u> are not given, display all of the options and their
                   values.  The currently supported options are:

                         <b>anonpass</b>     Defaults to $FTPANONPASS

                         <b>ftp_proxy</b>    Defaults to $ftp_proxy.

                         <b>http_proxy</b>   Defaults to $http_proxy.

                         <b>https_proxy</b>  Defaults to $https_proxy.

                         <b>no_proxy</b>     Defaults to $no_proxy.

                         <b>pager</b>        Defaults to $PAGER.

                         <b>prompt</b>       Defaults to $FTPPROMPT.

                         <b>rprompt</b>      Defaults to $FTPRPROMPT.

                         <b>sslnoverify</b>  Defaults to $FTPSSLNOVERIFY.

       <b>site</b> [<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>]
                   The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote FTP server as a SITE command.

       <b>size</b> <u>remote-file</u>
                   Return size of <u>remote-file</u> on remote machine.

       <b>sndbuf</b> <u>size</u>
                   Set the size of the socket send buffer to <u>size</u>.

       <b>status</b>      Show the current status of <b>tnftp</b>.

       <b>struct</b> <u>struct-name</u>
                   Set  the  file transfer <u>structure</u> to <u>struct-name</u>.  The default (and only supported) structure
                   is ‘file’.

       <b>sunique</b>     Toggle storing of files on remote machine under unique file names.   The  remote  FTP  server
                   must  support  FTP  protocol  STOU command for successful completion.  The remote server will
                   report unique name.  Default value is off.

       <b>system</b>      Show the type of operating system running on the remote machine.

       <b>tenex</b>       Set the file transfer type to that needed to talk to TENEX machines.

       <b>throttle</b>    A synonym for <b>rate</b>.

       <b>trace</b>       Toggle packet tracing.

       <b>type</b> [<u>type-name</u>]
                   Set the file transfer <b>type</b> to <u>type-name</u>.  If no  type  is  specified,  the  current  type  is
                   printed.  The default type is network ASCII.

       <b>umask</b> [<u>newmask</u>]
                   Set  the  default  umask on the remote server to <u>newmask</u>.  If <u>newmask</u> is omitted, the current
                   umask is printed.

       <b>unset</b> <u>option</u>
                   Unset <u>option</u>.  Refer to <b>set</b> for more information.

       <b>usage</b> <u>command</u>
                   Print the usage message for <u>command</u>.

       <b>user</b> <u>user-name</u> [<u>password</u> [<u>account</u>]]
                   Identify yourself to the remote FTP server.  If the <u>password</u> is not specified and the  server
                   requires  it,  <b>tnftp</b> will prompt the user for it (after disabling local echo).  If an <u>account</u>
                   field is not specified, and the FTP server requires it, the user will be prompted for it.  If
                   an <u>account</u> field is specified, an account command will be relayed to the remote server  after
                   the  login  sequence  is  completed  if  the remote server did not require it for logging in.
                   Unless <b>tnftp</b> is invoked with “auto-login” disabled, this process  is  done  automatically  on
                   initial connection to the FTP server.

       <b>verbose</b>     Toggle verbose mode.  In verbose mode, all responses from the FTP server are displayed to the
                   user.   In  addition,  if verbose is on, when a file transfer completes, statistics regarding
                   the efficiency of the transfer are reported.  By default, verbose is on.

       <b>xferbuf</b> <u>size</u>
                   Set the size of the socket send and receive buffers to <u>size</u>.

       <b>?</b> [<u>command</u>]
                   A synonym for <b>help</b>.

       Command arguments which have embedded spaces may be quoted with quote ‘"’ marks.

       Commands which  toggle  settings  can  take  an  explicit  <b>on</b>  or  <b>off</b>  argument  to  force  the  setting
       appropriately.

       Commands  which  take  a  byte  count  as an argument (e.g., <b>hash</b>, <b>rate</b>, and <b>xferbuf</b>) support an optional
       suffix on the argument which changes the interpretation of the argument.  Supported suffixes are:
             <b>b</b>    Causes no modification.  (Optional)
             <b>k</b>    Kilo; multiply the argument by 1024
             <b>m</b>    Mega; multiply the argument by 1048576
             <b>g</b>    Giga; multiply the argument by 1073741824

       If <b>tnftp</b> receives a SIGINFO (see the <b>status</b> argument of <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1)) or SIGQUIT signal whilst a  transfer  is
       in  progress,  the  current transfer rate statistics will be written to the standard error output, in the
       same format as the standard completion message.

</pre><h4><b>AUTO-FETCHING</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to standard commands, this version of <b>tnftp</b> supports an auto-fetch feature.  To enable  auto-
       fetch, simply pass the list of hostnames/files on the command line.

       The following formats are valid syntax for an auto-fetch element:

       [<u>user</u><b>@</b>]<u>host</u><b>:</b>[<u>path</u>][<b>/</b>]
             “Classic” FTP format.

             If  <u>path</u> contains a glob character and globbing is enabled, (see <b>glob</b>), then the equivalent of <b>mget</b>
             <u>path</u> is performed.

             If the directory component of <u>path</u> contains no globbing characters, it is stored locally  with  the
             name basename (see <u><a href="../man1/basename.1.html">basename</a></u>(1)) of <b>path</b>, in the current directory.  Otherwise, the full remote name
             is used as the local name, relative to the local root directory.

       <b>ftp://</b>[<u>user</u>[<b>:</b><u>password</u>]<b>@</b>]<u>host</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]<b>/</b><u>path</u>[<b>/</b>][<b>;type=</b><u>type</u>]
             An  FTP  URL, retrieved using the FTP protocol if <b>set</b> <b>ftp_proxy</b> isn't defined.  Otherwise, transfer
             the URL using HTTP via the proxy defined in <b>set</b> <b>ftp_proxy</b>.  If <b>set</b> <b>ftp_proxy</b> isn't defined and <u>user</u>
             is given, login as <u>user</u>.  In this case, use <u>password</u> if supplied, otherwise  prompt  the  user  for
             one.

             If  a suffix of ‘;type=A’ or ‘;type=I’ is supplied, then the transfer type will take place as ascii
             or binary (respectively).  The default transfer type is binary.

             In order to be compliant with <b>RFC</b> <b>3986</b>, <b>tnftp</b> interprets the <u>path</u> part of  an  ‘ftp://’  auto-fetch
             URL as follows:

             <b>•</b>   The  ‘/’  immediately  after the <u>host</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>] is interpreted as a separator before the <u>path</u>, and
                 not as part of the <u>path</u> itself.

             <b>•</b>   The <u>path</u> is interpreted as a ‘<b>/</b>’-separated list of name components.  For all but the last  such
                 component,  <b>tnftp</b>  performs the equivalent of a <b>cd</b> command.  For the last path component, <b>tnftp</b>
                 performs the equivalent of a <b>get</b> command.

             <b>•</b>   Empty name components, which result from ‘//’ within the <u>path</u>, or from  an  extra  ‘/’  at  the
                 beginning  of  the  <u>path</u>,  will  cause the equivalent of a <b>cd</b> command without a directory name.
                 This is unlikely to be useful.

             <b>•</b>   Any ‘<b>%</b><u>XX</u>’ codes (per <b>RFC</b> <b>3986</b>) within the path components are decoded, with <u>XX</u>  representing  a
                 character  code  in  hexadecimal.  This decoding takes place after the <u>path</u> has been split into
                 components, but before each component is used in the equivalent of a <b>cd</b> or <b>get</b>  command.   Some
                 often-used codes are ‘%2F’ (which represents ‘/’) and ‘%7E’ (which represents ‘~’).

             The above interpretation has the following consequences:

             <b>•</b>   The path is interpreted relative to the default login directory of the specified user or of the
                 ‘anonymous’  user.   If  the <u>/</u> directory is required, use a leading path of ‘%2F’.  If a user's
                 home directory is required (and the remote server supports the syntax), use a leading  path  of
                 ‘%7E<u>user</u><b>/</b>’.   For example, to retrieve <u>/etc/motd</u> from ‘localhost’ as the user ‘myname’ with the
                 password ‘mypass’, use ‘<a href="ftp://myname">ftp://myname</a>:mypass@localhost/%2fetc/motd’

             <b>•</b>   The exact <b>cd</b> and <b>get</b> commands can be controlled by careful choice of where to use ‘/’ and where
                 to use ‘%2F’ (or ‘%2f’).  For example, the following URLs correspond to the equivalents of  the
                 indicated commands:

                 <b>ftp://</b><u>host</u><b>/</b><u>dir1</u><b>/</b><u>dir2</u><b>/</b><u>file</u>         <b>cd</b> <u>dir1</u>, <b>cd</b> <u>dir2</u>, <b>get</b> <u>file</u>.

                 <b>ftp://</b><u>host</u><b>/%2F</b><u>dir1</u><b>/</b><u>dir2</u><b>/</b><u>file</u>      <b>cd</b> <b>/</b><u>dir1</u>, <b>cd</b> <u>dir2</u>, <b>get</b> <u>file</u>.

                 <b>ftp://</b><u>host</u><b>/</b><u>dir1</u><b>%2F</b><u>dir2</u><b>/</b><u>file</u>       <b>cd</b> <u>dir1</u><b>/</b><u>dir2</u>, <b>get</b> <u>file</u>.

             <b>•</b>   You  must  have  appropriate access permission for each of the intermediate directories that is
                 used in the equivalent of a <b>cd</b> command.

       <b>http://</b>[<u>user</u>[<b>:</b><u>password</u>]<b>@</b>]<u>host</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]<b>/</b><u>path</u>
             An HTTP URL, retrieved using the HTTP protocol.  If <b>set</b> <b>http_proxy</b> is defined, it is used as a  URL
             to  an  HTTP  proxy  server.   If  HTTP  authorization  is required to retrieve <u>path</u>, and <u>user</u> (and
             optionally <u>password</u>) is in the URL, use them for the first attempt to authenticate.

       <b>https://</b>[<u>user</u>[<b>:</b><u>password</u>]<b>@</b>]<u>host</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]<b>/</b><u>path</u>
             An HTTPS URL, retrieved using the HTTPS protocol.  If <b>set</b> <b>https_proxy</b> is defined, it is used  as  a
             URL  to  an HTTPS proxy server.  If HTTPS authorization is required to retrieve <u>path</u>, and <u>user</u> (and
             optionally <u>password</u>) is in the URL, use them for the  first  attempt  to  authenticate.   There  is
             currently no certificate validation and verification.

       <b>file:///</b><u>path</u>
             A local URL, copied from <u>/path</u> on the local host.

       <b>about:</b><u>topic</u>
             Display information regarding <u>topic</u>; no file is retrieved for this auto-fetched element.  Supported
             values include:

             <b>about:ftp</b>      Information about <b>tnftp</b>.

             <b>about:version</b>  The version of <b>tnftp</b>.  Useful to provide when reporting problems.

       Unless  noted otherwise above, and <b>-o</b> <u>output</u> is not given, the file is stored in the current directory as
       the <u><a href="../man1/basename.1.html">basename</a></u>(1) of <u>path</u>.  Note that if a HTTP redirect is received, the fetch is retried  using  the  new
       target  URL  supplied  by  the  server,  with  a  corresponding new <u>path</u>.  Using an explicit <b>-o</b> <u>output</u> is
       recommended, to avoid writing to unexpected file names.

       If a classic format or an FTP URL format has a trailing ‘/’ or an empty <u>path</u> component, then  <b>tnftp</b>  will
       connect  to  the  site  and <b>cd</b> to the directory given as the path, and leave the user in interactive mode
       ready for further input.  This will not work if <b>set</b> <b>ftp_proxy</b> is being used.

       Direct HTTP transfers use HTTP 1.1.  Proxied FTP and HTTP transfers use HTTP 1.0.

       If <b>-R</b> is given, all auto-fetches that don't go via the FTP or HTTP proxies will be restarted.   For  FTP,
       this  is  implemented  by using <b>reget</b> instead of <b>get</b>.  For HTTP, this is implemented by using the ‘Range:
       bytes=’ HTTP/1.1 directive.

       If WWW or proxy WWW authentication is required, you will be prompted to enter a username and password  to
       authenticate with.

       When  specifying  IPv6  numeric  addresses in a URL, you need to surround the address in square brackets.
       E.g.: ‘ftp://[::1]:21/’.  This is because colons are used in IPv6 numeric address as well  as  being  the
       separator for the port number.

</pre><h4><b>ABORTING</b> <b>A</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>TRANSFER</b></h4><pre>
       To  abort  a  file  transfer, use the terminal interrupt key (usually Ctrl-C).  Sending transfers will be
       immediately halted.  Receiving transfers will be halted by sending an FTP protocol ABOR  command  to  the
       remote server, and discarding any further data received.  The speed at which this is accomplished depends
       upon  the  remote  server's  support for ABOR processing.  If the remote server does not support the ABOR
       command, the prompt will not appear until the remote server has completed sending the requested file.

       If the terminal interrupt key sequence is used whilst <b>tnftp</b> is awaiting a reply from  the  remote  server
       for  the  ABOR  processing,  then  the connection will be closed.  This is different from the traditional
       behaviour (which ignores the terminal interrupt during this phase), but is considered more useful.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>NAMING</b> <b>CONVENTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Files specified as arguments to <b>tnftp</b> commands are processed according to the following rules.

       1.   If the file name ‘<b>-</b>’ is specified, the <u>stdin</u> (for reading) or <u>stdout</u> (for writing) is used.

       2.   If the first character of the file name is ‘|’, the remainder of the argument is  interpreted  as  a
            shell  command.   <b>tnftp</b>  then  forks  a  shell, using <u><a href="../man3/popen.3.html">popen</a></u>(3) with the argument supplied, and reads
            (writes) from the stdout (stdin).  If the shell  command  includes  spaces,  the  argument  must  be
            quoted; e.g.  ‘"| ls -lt"’.  A particularly useful example of this mechanism is: ‘dir "" |more’.

       3.   Failing  the  above  checks,  if globbing is enabled, local file names are expanded according to the
            rules used in the <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1); see the <b>glob</b> command.  If the <b>tnftp</b> command expects a  single  local  file
            (e.g.  <b>put</b>), only the first filename generated by the globbing operation is used.

       4.   For  <b>mget</b>  commands  and  <b>get</b>  commands with unspecified local file names, the local filename is the
            remote filename, which may be altered by a <b>case</b>, <b>ntrans</b>, or <b>nmap</b> setting.   The  resulting  filename
            may then be altered if <b>runique</b> is on.

       5.   For  <b>mput</b>  commands  and <b>put</b> commands with unspecified remote file names, the remote filename is the
            local filename, which may be altered by a <b>ntrans</b> or <b>nmap</b> setting.  The resulting filename  may  then
            be altered by the remote server if <b>sunique</b> is on.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>TRANSFER</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       The FTP specification specifies many parameters which may affect a file transfer.  The <b>type</b> may be one of
       “ascii”,  “image”  (binary),  “ebcdic”,  and “local byte size” (for PDP-10's and PDP-20's mostly).  <b>tnftp</b>
       supports the ascii and image types of file transfer, plus local byte size 8 for <b>tenex</b> mode transfers.

       <b>tnftp</b> supports only the default values for the  remaining  file  transfer  parameters:  <b>mode</b>,  <b>form</b>,  and
       <b>struct</b>.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>.netrc</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>.netrc</u> file contains login and initialization information used by the auto-login process.  It resides
       in  the  user's  home  directory,  unless  overridden with the <b>-N</b> <u>netrc</u> option, or specified in the NETRC
       environment variable.  The following tokens are recognized; they may be separated  by  spaces,  tabs,  or
       new-lines:

       <b>machine</b> <u>name</u>
                 Identify  a remote machine <u>name</u>.  The auto-login process searches the <u>.netrc</u> file for a <b>machine</b>
                 token that matches the remote machine specified on the <b>tnftp</b> command line or as an <b>open</b> command
                 argument.  Once a match is made, the subsequent <u>.netrc</u> tokens are processed, stopping when  the
                 end of file is reached or another <b>machine</b> or a <b>default</b> token is encountered.

       <b>default</b>   This  is  the same as <b>machine</b> <u>name</u> except that <b>default</b> matches any name.  There can be only one
                 <b>default</b> token, and it must be after all <b>machine</b> tokens.  This is normally used as:

                       <b>default</b> <b>login</b> <b>anonymous</b> <b>password</b> <b>user@site</b>

                 thereby giving the user an automatic anonymous FTP login to machines not specified  in  <u>.netrc</u>.
                 This can be overridden by using the <b>-n</b> flag to disable auto-login.

       <b>login</b> <u>name</u>
                 Identify  a  user on the remote machine.  If this token is present, the auto-login process will
                 initiate a login using the specified <u>name</u>.

       <b>password</b> <u>string</u>
                 Supply a password.  If this token is present, the auto-login process will supply the  specified
                 string  if  the  remote  server requires a password as part of the login process.  Note that if
                 this token is present in the <u>.netrc</u> file for any user other than <u>anonymous</u>,  <b>tnftp</b>  will  abort
                 the auto-login process if the <u>.netrc</u> is readable by anyone besides the user.

       <b>account</b> <u>string</u>
                 Supply  an  additional account password.  If this token is present, the auto-login process will
                 supply the specified string if the remote server requires an additional  account  password,  or
                 the auto-login process will initiate an ACCT command if it does not.

       <b>macdef</b> <u>name</u>
                 Define  a  macro.   This  token  functions like the <b>tnftp</b> <b>macdef</b> command functions.  A macro is
                 defined with the specified name; its contents begin with the  next  <u>.netrc</u>  line  and  continue
                 until  a blank line (consecutive new-line characters) is encountered.  Like the other tokens in
                 the <u>.netrc</u> file, a <b>macdef</b> is applicable only to the <b>machine</b> definition preceding it.  A  <b>macdef</b>
                 entry cannot be used by multiple <b>machine</b> definitions; rather, it must be defined following each
                 <b>machine</b>  it is intended to be used with.  If a macro named <b>init</b> is defined, it is automatically
                 executed as the last step in the auto-login process.  For example,

                       default
                       macdef init
                       epsv4 off

                 followed by a blank line.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>EDITING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tnftp</b> supports interactive command line editing, via the <u><a href="../man3/editline.3.html">editline</a></u>(3) library.  It  is  enabled  with  the
       <b>edit</b>  command,  and  is  enabled  by  default if input is from a tty.  Previous lines can be recalled and
       edited with the arrow keys, and other GNU Emacs-style editing keys may be used as well.

       The <u><a href="../man3/editline.3.html">editline</a></u>(3) library is configured with a <u>.editrc</u> file — refer to <u><a href="../man5/editrc.5.html">editrc</a></u>(5) for more information.

       An extra key binding is available to <b>tnftp</b> to provide context sensitive command and  filename  completion
       (including remote file completion).  To use this, bind a key to the <u><a href="../man3/editline.3.html">editline</a></u>(3) command <b>ftp-complete</b>.  By
       default, this is bound to the TAB key.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>PROMPT</b></h4><pre>
       By  default,  <b>tnftp</b>  displays a command line prompt of ‘<b>ftp&gt;</b> ’ to the user.  This can be changed with the
       <b>set</b> <b>prompt</b> command.

       A prompt can be displayed on the right side of the screen (after the command input) with the <b>set</b>  <b>rprompt</b>
       command.

       The following formatting sequences are replaced by the given information:

             <b>%/</b>   The current remote working directory.

             <b>%c</b>[[<b>0</b>]<u>n</u>], <b>%.</b>[[<b>0</b>]<u>n</u>]
                  The  trailing component of the current remote working directory, or <u>n</u> trailing components if a
                  digit <u>n</u> is given.  If <u>n</u> begins with ‘0’, the number of skipped components precede the trailing
                  component(s) in the format “<b>/&lt;</b><u>number</u><b>&gt;</b><u>trailing</u>” (for ‘%c’) or “<b>...</b><u>trailing</u>” (for ‘%.’).

             <b>%M</b>   The remote host name.

             <b>%m</b>   The remote host name, up to the first dot ‘.’.

             <b>%n</b>   The remote user name.

             <b>%%</b>   A single percent character ‘%’.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tnftp</b> uses the following environment variables.

       FTPANONPASS    Password to send in an anonymous FTP transfer.  Defaults to “<b>`whoami`@</b>”.

       FTPMODE        Overrides the default operation mode.  Support values are:

                      <b>active</b>   active mode FTP only

                      <b>auto</b>     automatic determination of passive or active (this is the default)

                      <b>gate</b>     gate-ftp mode

                      <b>passive</b>  passive mode FTP only

       FTPPROMPT      Command-line prompt to use.  Defaults to ‘<b>ftp&gt;</b> ’.  Refer to “COMMAND LINE PROMPT” for more
                      information.

       FTPRPROMPT     Command-line right side prompt to use.  Defaults to empty string.  Refer to “COMMAND  LINE
                      PROMPT” for more information.

       FTPSERVER      Host to use as gate-ftp server when <b>gate</b> is enabled.

       FTPSERVERPORT  Port  to  use  when  connecting  to gate-ftp server when <b>gate</b> is enabled.  Default is port
                      returned by a <u><a href="../man3/getservbyname.3.html">getservbyname</a></u>(3) lookup of “<b>ftpgate/tcp</b>”.

       FTPUSERAGENT   The value to send for the HTTP User-Agent header.

       FTPSSLNOVERIFY
                      Set to 1 to not verify SSL certificates.

       HOME           For default location of a <u>.netrc</u> file, if one exists.

       NETRC          An alternate location of the <u>.netrc</u> file.

       PAGER          Used by various commands to display files.  Defaults to <u><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></u>(1) if empty or not set.

       SHELL          For default shell.

       ftp_proxy      URL of FTP proxy to use when making FTP URL requests (if not defined, use the standard FTP
                      protocol).

                      See http_proxy for further notes about proxy use.

       http_proxy     URL of HTTP proxy to use when making  HTTP  URL  requests.   If  proxy  authentication  is
                      required and there is a username and password in this URL, they will automatically be used
                      in the first attempt to authenticate to the proxy.

                      If  “unsafe”  URL  characters are required in the username or password (for example ‘@’ or
                      ‘/’), encode them with <b>RFC</b> <b>3986</b> ‘%<u>XX</u>’ encoding.

                      Note that the use  of  a  username  and  password  in  ftp_proxy  and  http_proxy  may  be
                      incompatible with other programs that use it (such as <u><a href="../man1/lynx.1.html">lynx</a></u>(1)).

                      <u>NOTE</u>: this is not used for interactive sessions, only for command-line fetches.

       https_proxy    URL of HTTPS proxy to use when making HTTPS URL requests.

                      See http_proxy for further notes about proxy use.

       no_proxy       A  space  or  comma  separated  list of hosts (or domains) for which proxying is not to be
                      used.  Each entry may have an optional trailing ‘:<u>port</u>’, which restricts the  matching  to
                      connections to that port.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>PASSIVE</b> <b>MODE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>FIREWALLS</b></h4><pre>
       Some  firewall  configurations  do not allow <b>tnftp</b> to use extended passive mode.  If you find that even a
       simple <b>ls</b> appears to hang after printing a message such as this:

             <b>229</b> <b>Entering</b> <b>Extended</b> <b>Passive</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>(|||58551|)</b>

       then you will need to disable extended passive mode with <b>epsv4</b> <b>off</b>.  See the above  section  “The  .netrc
       File” for an example of how to make this automatic.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>tnftp</b> command appeared in 4.2BSD.

       Various  features  such  as  command line editing, context sensitive command and file completion, dynamic
       progress bar, automatic fetching of  files  and  URLs,  modification  time  preservation,  transfer  rate
       throttling,  configurable  command  line  prompt, and other enhancements over the standard BSD <b>tnftp</b> were
       implemented in NetBSD 1.3 and later releases by Luke Mewburn ⟨<a href="mailto:lukem@NetBSD.org">lukem@NetBSD.org</a>⟩.

       IPv6 support was added by the WIDE/KAME project (but may not be present in  all  non-NetBSD  versions  of
       this program, depending if the operating system supports IPv6 in a similar manner to KAME).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Correct execution of many commands depends upon proper behavior by the remote server.

       An  error in the treatment of carriage returns in the 4.2BSD ascii-mode transfer code has been corrected.
       This correction may result in incorrect transfers of binary files to and from 4.2BSD  servers  using  the
       ascii type.  Avoid this problem by using the binary image type.

       <b>tnftp</b>  assumes  that all IPv4 mapped addresses (IPv6 addresses with a form like <b>::ffff:10.1.1.1</b>) indicate
       IPv4  destinations  which  can  be  handled  by  AF_INET  sockets.   However,  in  certain  IPv6  network
       configurations,  this  assumption  is  not  true.   In such an environment, IPv4 mapped addresses must be
       passed to AF_INET6 sockets directly.  For example, if your site uses a SIIT translator  for  IPv6-to-IPv4
       translation, <b>tnftp</b> is unable to support your configuration.
