</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       intro - introduction to user commands

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Section  1 of the manual describes user commands and tools, for example, file manipulation tools, shells,
       compilers, web browsers, file and image viewers and editors, and so on.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Linux is a flavor of UNIX, and user commands under UNIX work similarly under Linux  (and  lots  of  other
       UNIX-like systems too, like FreeBSD).

       Under  Linux,  there  are  GUIs  (graphical user interfaces), where you can point and click and drag, and
       hopefully get work done without first reading lots of documentation.  The traditional UNIX environment is
       a CLI (command line interface), where you type commands to tell the computer what to do.  This is  faster
       and  more  powerful, but requires finding out what the commands are and how to use them.  Below is a bare
       minimum guide to get you started.

   <b>Login</b>
       In order to start working, you'll probably first have to open a session.  The program <b><a href="../man1/login.1.html">login</a></b>(1) will  wait
       for  you  to type your username and password, and after that, it will start a <u>shell</u> (command interpreter)
       for you.  In case of a graphical login, you get a screen with menus or icons and a mouse click will start
       a shell in a window.  See also <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1).

   <b>The</b> <b>shell</b>
       One types commands into the <u>shell</u>, the command interpreter.  It is  not  built-in;  it  is  just  another
       program.   You  can  change  your  shell,  and everybody has their own favorite one.  The standard one is
       called <u>sh</u>.  See also <b><a href="../man1/ash.1.html">ash</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/chsh.1.html">chsh</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/dash.1.html">dash</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/ksh.1.html">ksh</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/zsh.1.html">zsh</a></b>(1).

       A session might look like this:

           knuth login: <b>aeb</b>
           Password: <b>********</b>
           $ <b>date</b>

           $ <b>mv</b> <b>tel</b> <b>tel1</b>
           $ <b>ls</b> <b>-l</b>
           total 3
           drwxr-xr-x   2 aeb       1024 Aug  6 23:51 bin
           -rw-r--r--   1 aeb         37 Aug  6 23:52 tel1
           -rw-r--r--   1 aeb         37 Aug  6 23:53 tel2
           $ <b>diff</b> <b>tel1</b> <b>tel2</b>
           $ <b>rm</b> <b>tel1</b>
           $ <b>grep</b> <b>maja</b> <b>tel2</b>
           maja    0501-1136285
           $

       Here typing Control-D ended the session.

       The <b>$</b> here was the command prompt—it is the shell's way of indicating that  it  is  ready  for  the  next
       command.   The  prompt  can  be  customized  in  lots of ways, and one might include stuff like username,
       machine name, current directory, time, and so on.  An assignment PS1="What next, master? "  would  change
       the prompt as indicated.

       We see that there are commands <u>date</u> (that gives date and time), and <u>cal</u> (that gives a calendar).

       The  command  <u>ls</u> lists the contents of the current directory—it tells you what files you have.  With a <u>-l</u>
       option it gives a long listing, that includes  the  owner  and  size  and  date  of  the  file,  and  the
       permissions  people  have  for  reading and/or changing the file.  For example, the file "tel" here is 37
       bytes long, owned by aeb and the owner can read and write  it,  others  can  only  read  it.   Owner  and
       permissions can be changed by the commands <u>chown</u> and <u>chmod</u>.

       The  command  <u>cat</u> will show the contents of a file.  (The name is from "concatenate and print": all files
       given as parameters are concatenated and sent to "standard output" (see  <b><a href="../man3/stdout.3.html">stdout</a></b>(3)),  here  the  terminal
       screen.)

       The command <u>cp</u> (from "copy") will copy a file.

       The command <u>mv</u> (from "move"), on the other hand, only renames it.

       The command <u>diff</u> lists the differences between two files.  Here there was no output because there were no
       differences.

       The  command  <u>rm</u>  (from  "remove") deletes the file, and be careful! it is gone.  No wastepaper basket or
       anything.  Deleted means lost.

       The command <u>grep</u> (from "g/re/p") finds occurrences of a string in one  or  more  files.   Here  it  finds
       Maja's telephone number.

   <b>Pathnames</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>directory</b>
       Files live in a large tree, the file hierarchy.  Each has a <u>pathname</u> describing the path from the root of
       the  tree  (which  is  called  <u>/</u>) to the file.  For example, such a full pathname might be <u>/home/aeb/tel</u>.
       Always using full pathnames would be inconvenient, and the name of a file in the current directory may be
       abbreviated by giving only the last component.  That is why <u>/home/aeb/tel</u> can be abbreviated to <u>tel</u>  when
       the current directory is <u>/home/aeb</u>.

       The command <u>pwd</u> prints the current directory.

       The command <u>cd</u> changes the current directory.

       Try alternatively <u>cd</u> and <u>pwd</u> commands and explore <u>cd</u> usage: "cd", "cd .", "cd ..", "cd /", and "cd ~".

   <b>Directories</b>
       The command <u>mkdir</u> makes a new directory.

       The command <u>rmdir</u> removes a directory if it is empty, and complains otherwise.

       The command <u>find</u> (with a rather baroque syntax) will find files with given name or other properties.  For
       example,  "find  .  -name tel" would find the file <u>tel</u> starting in the present directory (which is called
       <u>.</u>).  And "find / -name tel" would do the same, but starting at the root of the tree.  Large searches on a
       multi-GB disk will be time-consuming, and it may be better to use <b><a href="../man1/locate.1.html">locate</a></b>(1).

   <b>Disks</b> <b>and</b> <b>filesystems</b>
       The command <u>mount</u> will attach the filesystem found on some disk (or floppy, or CDROM or so)  to  the  big
       filesystem  hierarchy.  And <u>umount</u> detaches it again.  The command <u>df</u> will tell you how much of your disk
       is still free.

   <b>Processes</b>
       On a UNIX system many user and system processes run simultaneously.  The one you are talking to  runs  in
       the  <u>foreground</u>,  the  others in the <u>background</u>.  The command <u>ps</u> will show you which processes are active
       and what numbers these processes have.  The command <u>kill</u> allows you to get rid of them.   Without  option
       this  is  a  friendly request: please go away.  And "kill -9" followed by the number of the process is an
       immediate kill.  Foreground processes can often be killed by typing Control-C.

   <b>Getting</b> <b>information</b>
       There are thousands of commands, each with many options.  Traditionally commands are  documented  on  <u>man</u>
       <u>pages</u>,  (like  this one), so that the command "man kill" will document the use of the command "kill" (and
       "man man" document the command "man").  The program <u>man</u> sends the text through some <u>pager</u>, usually  <u>less</u>.
       Hit the space bar to get the next page, hit q to quit.

       In  documentation  it  is  customary  to  refer to man pages by giving the name and section number, as in
       <b><a href="../man1/man.1.html">man</a></b>(1).  Man pages are terse, and allow you to find quickly some  forgotten  detail.   For  newcomers  an
       introductory text with more examples and explanations is useful.

       A  lot  of GNU/FSF software is provided with info files.  Type "info info" for an introduction on the use
       of the program <u>info</u>.

       Special topics are often treated in HOWTOs.  Look in <u>/usr/share/doc/howto/en</u> and use  a  browser  if  you
       find HTML files there.
