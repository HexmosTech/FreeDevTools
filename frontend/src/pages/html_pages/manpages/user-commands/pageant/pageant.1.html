</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pageant</b>  is  both  an SSH authentication agent, and also a tool for communicating with an already-running
       agent.

       When running as an SSH agent, it listens on a Unix-domain socket for connections  from  client  processes
       running  under your user id. Clients can load SSH private keys into the agent, or request signatures on a
       given message from a key already in the agent.  This  permits  one-touch  authentication  by  SSH  client
       programs, if Pageant is holding a key that the server they are connecting to will accept.

       <b>pageant</b>  can  also  act as a client program itself, communicating with an already-running agent to add or
       remove keys, list the keys, or extract their public half.

       The agent protocol used by <b>pageant</b> is compatible with the PuTTY tools and also with other implementations
       such as OpenSSH's SSH client and <b>ssh-agent</b>(<u>1</u>).  Some  <b>pageant</b>  features  are  implemented  with  protocol
       extensions, so will only work if <b>pageant</b> is on both ends.

       To  run <b>pageant</b> as an agent, you must provide an option to tell it what its <u>lifetime</u> should be. Typically
       you would probably want Pageant to last for the duration of a login session, in which case you should use
       either <b>-X</b> or <b>-T</b>, depending on whether your login session is GUI or  purely  terminal-based  respectively.
       For example, in your X session startup script you might write

       <b>eval</b> <b>$(pageant</b> <b>-X)</b>

       which  will  cause  Pageant to start running, monitor the X server to notice when your session terminates
       (and then it will terminate too), and print on standard output some shell  commands  to  set  environment
       variables that client processes will need to find the running agent.

       In a terminal-based login, you could do almost exactly the same thing but with <b>-T</b>:

       <b>eval</b> <b>$(pageant</b> <b>-T)</b>

       This  will  cause Pageant to tie its lifetime to that of your controlling terminal: when you log out, and
       the terminal device ceases to be associated with your  session,  Pageant  will  notice  that  it  has  no
       controlling terminal any more, and will terminate automatically.

       In either of these modes, you can also add one or more private keys as extra command-line arguments, e.g.

       <b>eval</b> <b>$(pageant</b> <b>-T</b> <b><a href="file:~/.ssh/key.ppk">~/.ssh/key.ppk</a>)</b>

       in which case Pageant will immediately prompt for the keys' passphrases (if any) and start the agent with
       those  keys already loaded in cleartext form. Passphrase prompts will use the controlling terminal if one
       is available, or failing that the GUI if one of those is available. (The prompt method can be  overridden
       with  the  <b>--gui-prompt</b> or <b>--tty-prompt</b> options.) If neither is available, no passphrase prompting can be
       done.

       Alternatively, you can start an agent with keys stored in encrypted form:

       <b>eval</b> <b>$(pageant</b> <b>-T</b> <b>--encrypted</b> <b><a href="file:~/.ssh/key.ppk">~/.ssh/key.ppk</a>)</b>

       In this case, Pageant will not prompt for a passphrase at startup; instead, it will prompt the first time
       a client tries to use the key. (Pageant will need access to a GUI so that it  can  pop  up  a  passphrase
       prompt when required, unless it's running in <b>--debug</b> mode.)

       To use Pageant to talk to an existing agent, you can add new keys using <b>-a</b>, list the current set of keys'
       fingerprints  and  comments  with <b>-l</b>, extract the full public half of any key using <b>--public</b> or <b>--public-</b>
       <b>openssh</b>, delete a specific key or all keys using <b>-d</b> or <b>-D</b> respectively, or  request  re-encryption  of  a
       specific key or all keys using <b>-r</b> or <b>-R</b> respectively.

</pre><h4><b>LIFETIME</b></h4><pre>
       The  following options are called <u>lifetime</u> <u>modes</u>. They all request Pageant to operate in agent mode; each
       one specifies a different method for Pageant to start up and know when to shut down.

       <b>-X</b>     Pageant will open a connection to your X display, and  when  that  connection  is  lost,  it  will
              terminate.  This  gives  it  the  same  lifetime  as your GUI login session, so in this mode it is
              suitable for running from a startup  script  such  as  <b>.xsession</b>.  The  actual  agent  will  be  a
              subprocess;  the  main  Pageant  process  will  terminate immediately, after printing environment-
              variable setting commands on standard output which should be installed in any process  wanting  to
              communicate with the agent.

              The usual approach would be to run

              <b>eval</b> <b>$(pageant</b> <b>-X)</b>

              in an X session startup script. However, other possibilities exist, such as directing the standard
              output of `<b>pageant</b> <b>-X</b>' to a file which is then sourced by any new shell.

       <b>-T</b>     Pageant will tie its lifetime to that of the login session running on its controlling terminal, by
              noticing  when it ceases to have a controlling terminal (which will automatically happen as a side
              effect of the session leader process  terminating).  Like  <b>-X</b>,  Pageant  will  print  environment-
              variable commands on standard output.

       <b>--exec</b> <u>command</u>
              Pageant  will run the provided command as a subprocess, preloaded with the appropriate environment
              variables to access the agent it starts up. When the subprocess terminates, Pageant will terminate
              as well.

              All arguments on Pageant's command line after <b>--exec</b> will be treated as part  of  the  command  to
              run, even if they look like other valid Pageant options or key files.

       <b>--permanent</b>
              Pageant  will  fork  off  a subprocess to be the agent, and print environment-variable commands on
              standard output, like <b>-X</b> and <b>-T</b>. However, in this case, it  will  make  no  effort  to  limit  its
              lifetime  in  any  way;  it  will  simply run permanently, unless manually killed. The environment
              variable <b>SSH_AGENT_PID</b>, set by the commands printed by Pageant, permits the agent  process  to  be
              found for this purpose.

              This  option is not recommended, because any method of manually killing the agent carries the risk
              of the session terminating unexpectedly before it manages to happen.

       <b>--debug</b>
              Pageant will run in the foreground, without forking. It will print its environment variable  setup
              commands  on  standard output, and then it will log all agent activity to standard output as well;
              any passphrase prompts will need to be answered on standard input. This is  useful  for  debugging
              what Pageant itself is doing, or what another process is doing to it.

       <b>--foreground</b>
              Like  <b>--debug</b>,  Pageant will run in the foreground, without forking. It will print its environment
              variable setup commands on standard output. Unlike <b>--debug</b>, Pageant  will  not  automatically  log
              agent activity to standard output, nor will it force passphrase prompts to standard input. This is
              useful  if  Pageant  is  spawned  by  a parent process that controls or otherwise programmatically
              interfaces with Pageant.

              After Pageant prints its environment setup commands, it closes its  standard  output.  So  if  the
              parent process has run it in a pipe to retrieve the environment setup commands, it can simply read
              until it receives EOF, instead of having to know how many lines of output to expect.

</pre><h4><b>CLIENT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  options  tell  Pageant  to  operate  in  client  mode,  contacting  an existing agent via
       environment variables that it should already have set.

       <b>-a</b> <u>key-files</u>
              Load the specified private  key  file(s)  and  add  them  to  the  already-running  agent.  Unless
              <b>--encrypted</b>  is  also  specified,  <b>pageant</b>  will  decrypt them if necessary by prompting for their
              passphrases (with the same choice of user interfaces as in agent mode).

              The private key files must be in PuTTY's <b>.ppk</b> file format.

       <b>-l</b>     List the keys currently in the running agent. Each key's fingerprint and comment  string  will  be
              shown. (Use the <b>-E</b> option to change the fingerprint format.)

              Keys  that will require a passphrase on their next use are listed as `encrypted'. Keys that can be
              returned to this state with <b>-r</b> are listed as `re-encryptable'.

       <b>--public</b> <u>key-identifiers</u>
              Print the public half of each specified key, in the RFC  4716  standard  format  (multiple  lines,
              starting with `<b>----</b> <b>BEGIN</b> <b>SSH2</b> <b>PUBLIC</b> <b>KEY</b> <b>----</b>').

              Each <u>key-identifier</u> can be any of the following:

              <b>•</b>      The  name of a file containing the key, either the whole key (again in <b>.ppk</b> format) or just
                     its public half.

              <b>•</b>      The key's comment string, as shown by <b>pageant</b> <b>-l</b>.

              <b>•</b>      Enough of one of the key's fingerprint formats to be unique  among  keys  currently  loaded
                     into the agent.

              If  Pageant can uniquely identify one key by interpreting the <u>key-identifier</u> in any of these ways,
              it will assume that key was the one you meant. If it cannot, you will have to specify more detail.

              If you find that your desired <u>key-identifier</u> string can be validly interpreted as more than one of
              the above <u>kinds</u> of identification, you can disambiguate by prefixing it as follows:

              `<b>file:</b>'
                     to indicate that it is a filename

              `<b>comment:</b>'
                     to indicate that it is a comment string

              `<b>fp:</b>'  to indicate that it is a fingerprint; any fingerprint format will be matched

              `<b>sha256:</b>' or `<b>md5:</b>'
                     to indicate that it is a fingerprint of a specific format

              `<b>sha256-cert:</b>' or `<b>md5-cert:</b>'
                     to indicate that it is a fingerprint of a specific format,  and  specifically  matches  the
                     fingerprint of the public key <u>including</u> a certificate if any

       <b>--public-openssh</b> <u>key-identifiers</u>, <b>-L</b> <u>key-identifiers</u>
              Print  the public half of each specified key, in the one-line format used by OpenSSH, suitable for
              putting in <b>.ssh/authorized_keys</b> files.

       <b>-d</b> <u>key-identifiers</u>
              Delete each specified key from the agent's memory, so that the agent will no longer  serve  it  to
              clients unless it is loaded in again using <b>pageant</b> <b>-a</b>.

       <b>-D</b>     Delete all keys from the agent's memory, leaving it completely empty.

       <b>-r</b> <u>key-identifiers</u>
              `Re-encrypt'  each specified key in the agent's memory - that is, forget any cleartext version, so
              that the user will be prompted for a passphrase again next time the key is used. (For this  to  be
              possible, the key must previously have been added with the <b>--encrypted</b> option.)

              (Holding  encrypted  keys  is a Pageant extension, so this option and <b>-R</b> are unlikely to work with
              other agents.)

       <b>-R</b>     `Re-encrypt' all possible keys in the agent's memory. (This may leave some keys in  cleartext,  if
              they were not previously added with the <b>--encrypted</b> option.)

       <b>--test-sign</b> <u>key-identifier</u>

       <b>--test-sign-with-flags=</b><u>flags</u> <u>key-identifier</u>
              Sign arbitrary data with the given key. This mode is only likely to be useful when testing <b>pageant</b>
              itself.

              The data to sign is taken from standard input, signed by the agent with the key identified by <u>key-</u>
              <u>identifier</u>, and the resulting signature emitted on standard output (as a binary blob in the format
              defined by the SSH specifications).

              <u>flags</u> is a number representing a combination of flag bits defined by the SSH agent protocol.

</pre><h4><b>SSH-ASKPASS</b> <b>REPLACEMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--askpass</b> <u>prompt</u>
              With  this  option,  <b>pageant</b> acts as an <b>ssh-askpass</b>(<u>1</u>) replacement, rather than performing any SSH
              agent functionality. This may be useful if you prefer Pageant's GUI prompt style, which  minimises
              information  leakage  about  your passphrase length in its visual feedback, compared to other <b>ssh-</b>
              <b>askpass</b>(<u>1</u>) implementations.

              <b>pageant</b> <b>--askpass</b> implements the standard <b>ssh-askpass</b>(<u>1</u>) interface: it can be passed a  prompt  to
              display  (as  a  single argument) and, if successful, prints the passphrase on standard output and
              returns a zero exit status. Typically you would use the environment variable <b>SSH_ASKPASS</b>  to  tell
              other programs to use <b>pageant</b> in this way.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v</b>     Verbose  mode. When Pageant runs in agent mode, this option causes it to log all agent activity to
              its standard error. For example, you might run

              <b>eval</b> <b>$(pageant</b> <b>-X</b> <b>-v</b> <b>2&gt;<a href="file:~/.pageant.log">~/.pageant.log</a>)</b>

              and expect a list of all signatures requested by agent clients to build up in that log file.

              The log information is the same as that produced by the <b>--debug</b> lifetime option, but <b>--debug</b> sends
              it to standard output (since that is the main point of debugging mode) whereas  <b>-v</b>  in  all  other
              lifetime modes sends the same log data to standard error (being a by-product of the program's main
              purpose). Using <b>-v</b> in <b>--debug</b> mode has no effect: the log still goes to standard output.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>-c</b> Force  Pageant to output its environment setup commands in the style of POSIX / Bourne shells (<b>-s</b>)
              or C shells (<b>-c</b>) respectively. If neither option is given, Pageant will guess based on whether the
              environment variable <b>SHELL</b> has a value ending in `<b>csh</b>'.

       <b>--symlink</b> <u>fixed-path</u>
              When operating in agent mode, as well as creating a uniquely named listening socket, <b>pageant</b>  will
              also create (or update) a symbolic link at <u>fixed-path</u> pointing to that socket.

              This  allows  access  to  an  agent  instance by setting the <b>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</b> environment variable to
              <u>fixed-path</u>, rather than having to use the value invented by <b>pageant</b> when it  starts.  It's  mainly
              expected to be useful for debugging.

       <b>--encrypted</b>, <b>--no-decrypt</b>
              When  adding  keys to the agent (at startup or later), keep them in encrypted form until the first
              attempt to use them; the user will be prompted for a passphrase then. Once decrypted, a  key  that
              was added in this way can be `re-encrypted' with the <b>-r</b> or <b>-R</b> client options.

              The <b>--encrypted</b> option makes no difference for key files which do not have a passphrase.

              (Storing  keys  in encrypted form is a Pageant extension; other agent implementations are unlikely
              to support it.)

       <b>-E</b> <u>fingerprint-type</u>, <b>--fptype</b> <u>fingerprint-type</u>
              Specify the fingerprint format to print. Only applicable when listing fingerprints  with  <b>-l</b>.  The
              available formats are <b>sha256</b> (the default) and <b>md5</b>.

       <b>--gui-prompt</b>, <b>--tty-prompt</b>
              Force Pageant to prompt for key passphrases with a particular method (GUI or terminal) rather than
              trying  to  guess  the  most  appropriate  method  as described above. (These options are relevant
              whenever a key file is specified to <b>pageant</b> that needs  immediate  decryption,  and  in  <b>--askpass</b>
              mode.)

       <b>--help</b> Print a brief summary of command-line options and terminate.

       <b>--version</b>, <b>-V</b>
              Print the version of Pageant.

       <b>--</b>     Cause all subsequent arguments to be treated as key file names, even if they look like options.
