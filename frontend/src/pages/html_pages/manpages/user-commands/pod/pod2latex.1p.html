</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pod2latex - convert pod documentation to latex format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         pod2latex *.pm

         pod2latex -out mytex.tex *.pod

         pod2latex -full -sections 'DESCRIPTION|NAME' SomeDir

         pod2latex -prefile h.tex -postfile t.tex my.pod

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "pod2latex" is a program to convert POD format documentation (perlpod) into latex. It can process
       multiple input documents at a time and either generate a latex file per input document or a single
       combined output file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes the supported command line options. Minimum matching is supported.

       <b>-out</b>
           Name of the output file to be used. If there are multiple input pods it is assumed that the intention
           is  to  write  all  translated  output into a single file. ".tex" is appended if not present.  If the
           argument is not supplied, a single document will be created for each input file.

       <b>-full</b>
           Creates a complete "latex" file that can be processed immediately  (unless  "=for/=begin"  directives
           are  used that rely on extra packages).  Table of contents and index generation commands are included
           in the wrapper "latex" code.

       <b>-sections</b>
           Specify  pod  sections  to  include  (or  remove  if  negated)  in  the  translation.   See  "SECTION
           SPECIFICATIONS"  in  Pod::Select  for  the  format  to use for <u>section-spec</u>. This option may be given
           multiple times on the command line.This is identical to  the  similar  option  in  the  "podselect()"
           command.

       <b>-modify</b>
           This  option  causes  the  output "latex" to be slightly modified from the input pod such that when a
           "=head1 NAME" is encountered a section is created containing the actual pod name (rather  than  <b>NAME</b>)
           and  all  subsequent  "=head1" directives are treated as subsections. This has the advantage that the
           description of a module will be in its own section which is helpful for including module descriptions
           in documentation.  Also forces "latex" label and index entries to be prefixed  by  the  name  of  the
           module.

       <b>-h1level</b>
           Specifies  the "latex" section that is equivalent to a "H1" pod directive. This is an integer between
           0 and 5 with 0 equivalent to a "latex" chapter, 1 equivalent to a "latex" section etc. The default is
           1 ("H1" equivalent to a latex section).

       <b>-help</b>
           Print a brief help message and exit.

       <b>-man</b>
           Print the manual page and exit.

       <b>-verbose</b>
           Print information messages as each document is processed.

       <b>-preamble</b>
           A user-supplied preamble for the LaTeX code. Multiple values are  supported  and  appended  in  order
           separated by "\n".  See <b>-prefile</b> for reading the preamble from a file.

       <b>-postamble</b>
           A  user  supplied  postamble  for the LaTeX code. Multiple values are supported and appended in order
           separated by "\n".  See <b>-postfile</b> for reading the postamble from a file.

       <b>-prefile</b>
           A user-supplied preamble for the LaTeX code to be read from  the  named  file.  Multiple  values  are
           supported and appended in order. See <b>-preamble</b>.

       <b>-postfile</b>
           A  user-supplied  postamble  for  the  LaTeX code to be read from the named file. Multiple values are
           supported and appended in order. See <b>-postamble</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Known bugs are:

       •   Cross references between documents are not resolved when multiple pod documents are converted into  a
           single output "latex" file.

       •   Functions  and variables are not automatically recognized and they will therefore not be marked up in
           any special way unless instructed by an explicit pod command.
