</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       scheme48 - a Scheme interpreter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scheme48</b> [-i image] [-h heapsize] [-a argument]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scheme48</b>  is an implementation of the Scheme programming language as described in the <u>Revised^5</u> <u>Report</u> <u>on</u>
       <u>the</u> <u>Algorithmic</u> <u>Language</u> <u>Scheme.</u>  A runnable system  requires  two  parts,  an  executable  program  that
       implements  the  Scheme  48  virtual  machine,  and  an image that is used to initialize the store of the
       virtual machine.  <b>scheme48</b> is a shell script that starts the virtual machine with an image that runs in a
       Scheme command loop.

       The <b>scheme48</b> command loop reads Scheme expressions, evaluates them, and prints their  results.   It  also
       executes commands, which are identified by an initial comma character.  Type the command <u>,help</u> to receive
       a list of available commands.

       The  meaning  of  the <b>-h</b> option depends on the type of garbage collector that was chosen at configuration
       time.  If <u>heapsize</u> is a positive number, it specifies the number of words that can be live at  any  given
       time.   One  word  is  four bytes.  Cons cells are currently 3 words, so if you want to make sure you can
       allocate, say, a million cons cells, you should specify <b>-h</b> 3000000 (actually a little  more,  to  account
       for the initial heap image and breathing room).

       If  you specify a maximum smaller than the memory needed to load the image file, the maximum is increased
       accordingly and a message is written to the console.

       For the BIBOP garbage collector, <u>heapsize</u> may be 0.  This means the heap will possibly keep growing until
       your system runs out of memory. Because of this risk, a warning message is written to the console if  you
       specify <b>-h</b> 0.

       The  <u>,dump</u>  and <u>,build</u> commands put heap images in files.  The <b>-i</b> option causes the initial heap image to
       be taken from file <u>image</u>.  The <b>-a</b> option causes a list of strings to be passed  as  the  argument  to  an
       image generated using the <u>,build</u> command.  The first argument to <u>,build</u> is a procedure that is passed the
       arguments  following  <b>-a</b>  and  which should return an integer (which is the return value of the Scheme 48
       process).

            &gt; ,build (lambda (a) (display a) (newline) 0) foo.image
            &gt; ,exit
            $ scheme48 -i foo.image -a mumble
            mumble
            $

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/usr/lib/scheme48-1.9.2/scheme48vm</b>      the virtual machine.

       <b>/usr/lib/scheme48-1.9.2/scheme48.image</b>  the default image.

                                                                                                     <u><a href="../man1/scheme48.1.html">scheme48</a></u>(1)
