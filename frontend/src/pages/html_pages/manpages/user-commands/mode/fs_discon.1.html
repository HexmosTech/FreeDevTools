       fs_discon - Manage client "disconnected mode"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fs</b> <b>discon</b> <b>-mode</b> &lt;offline | online&gt;
           [<b>-policy</b> &lt;client | server&gt;]
           [<b>-force</b>]
           [<b>-uid</b> &lt;<u>uid</u>&gt;]
           [<b>-help</b>]

       <b>fs</b> <b>disc</b> <b>-m</b> &lt;offline | online&gt;
           [<b>-p</b> &lt;client | server&gt;]
           [<b>-f</b>]
           [<b>-u</b> &lt;<u>uid</u>&gt;]
           [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>fs</b> <b>discon</b> command configures "disconnected mode" in the OpenAFS Cache Manager. Disconnected mode
       allows you to keep reading and writing files in AFS without a network connection, and any changes to
       files are recorded locally.  When the network connection is restored and disconnected mode is turned off,
       any locally recorded changes are sent to the relevant server.

       This command was introduced in OpenAFS 1.5.38.

</pre><h4><b>CAUTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The "disconnected mode" of the OpenAFS cache manager is still considered an experimental feature. It can
       be a bit rough around the edges, and you may lose or corrupt data you have written while in disconnected
       mode. Use with caution.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-mode</b> &lt;offline | online&gt;
           This  turns  "disconnected  mode"  on  or  off.  If  "offline"  is specified, the client will go into
           disconnected mode, and the client will no longer make  any  effort  to  reach  any  server  over  the
           network.

           If "online" is specified, the client will come out of disconnected mode, and any pending changes will
           be  sent  to  the  relevant server. If there are errors when synchronizing changes to the server, the
           client will stay in disconnected mode, unless the <b>-force</b> flag is also given. See <b>-force</b>.

       <b>-policy</b> &lt;client | server&gt;
           This specifies the conflict resolution policy when resynchronizing data afer coming  back  online.  A
           conflict  resolution  policy  is  needed  when  changes have been made locally on the client while in
           disconnected mode, and different changes have occurred on the server while we  were  in  disconnected
           mode. When this happens, there are two different possible results:

           If  "client"  is specified, the local changes on the client will overwrite any conflicting changes on
           the server. This means that if we change a file locally while in disconnected mode, and another  user
           changes the same file in the same place on the fileserver while we are disconnected, the other user's
           changes will be lost.

           If  "server"  is  specified,  the conflicting changes on the server will overwrite our local changes.
           This means that if we change a file locally while in disconnected mode, and another user changes  the
           same  file  in  the same place on the fileserver while we are disconnected, our local changes will be
           lost.

           The default value is "server".

       <b>-force</b>
           If <b>-force</b> is specified when coming back online, any errors during resynchronization  are  ignored  by
           throwing  away  our  local  changes. That is, if we write our local pending changes to a server while
           coming back online, and there is an error while writing those changes, those changes will be lost.

           Without <b>-force</b>, such an error causes the client to stay offline.

       <b>-uid</b> &lt;<u>uid</u>&gt;
           When resynchronizing local pending changes  to  the  relevant  fileserver,  by  default  we  use  the
           credentials  of  the  user  issuing  <b>fs</b>  <b>discon</b>  to  send  the  changes to the fileserver. If <b>-uid</b> is
           specified, we will instead use the credentials for the specified uid.

           Note that this will only use the PAG-less credentials of the  specified  uid.  It  is  currently  not
           possible to specify an arbitrary PAG here.

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.
