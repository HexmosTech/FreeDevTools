</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-annex-sim - simulate a network of repositories

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       git annex sim start [my.sim]

       git annex sim command

       git annex sim show

       git annex sim end

       git annex sim run my.sim

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  command  simulates  the behavior of git-annex in a network of repositories, determining which files
       would reach which repositories according to the configuration  of  preferred  content,  numcopies,  trust
       level, etc.

       The  input to the simulation is a sim file, and/or sim commands that are run after starting it. These are
       in the form "git annex sim command" with the command in the same format used in the  sim  file  (see  sim
       commands list below). For example, "git annex sim step 1" runs the simulation one step.

       The simulation keeps a log as it runs, which contains the entire simulation input, as well as the actions
       performed  in  the simulation, and the results of the simulation. Use "git-annex sim show" to display the
       log. This allows re-running the  same  simulation  later,  as  well  as  analyzing  the  results  of  the
       simulation.

       Use "git annex sim end" to finish the simulation, and clean up.

       As  a  convenience,  to  run  a sim from a file, and then stop it, use "git-annex sim run". If there is a
       problem running the sim, it will be shown before it is stopped.

       Note that interrupting this command while it is running may  leave  the  simulation  in  an  inconsistent
       state.  And  running  multiple sim commands at the same time can as well, although it is safe to run "git
       annex sim visit" while running other sim commands.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>SIM</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       This text file is used to configure the simulation and also to report on the results of  the  simulation.
       Each  line  takes the form of a command followed by parameters to the command. Lines starting with "#" or
       "--" are comments.

       Here is an example sim file:

        # add repositories to the simulation and connect them as remotes
        init foo
        init bar
        connect foo &lt;-&gt; bar

        # add a special remote
        initremote baz
        connect foo -&gt; baz &lt;- bar

        # configure repositories
        numcopies 2
        group foo client
        wanted foo standard
        group bar archive
        wanted bar standard
        wanted baz include=*.mp3

        # add annexed files in the working tree to the simulation, as if they
        # were just added to repository foo
        addtree foo include=*.mp3
        addtree foo include=*.jpg
        addtree foo include=bigfiles/

        # add simulated annexed files
        add bigfile 100gb bar
        add hugefile 10tb foo

        # run the simulation forward by ten steps
        step 10

        # remove foo's remote bar and see if a new file added to foo reaches bar
        disconnect foo -&gt; bar
        add foo.mp3 2mb foo
        step 5

</pre><h4><b>SIM</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       This is the full set of commands that can be used in the sim file as well as passed to  "git  annex  sim"
       while a simulation is running.

       <b>init</b> <b>name</b>
              Initialize a simulated repository, giving it a name that will be used in the simulation.

       <b>initremote</b> <b>name</b>
              Initialize a simulated special remote.

       <b>use</b> <b>name</b> <b>here|remote|description|uuid</b>
              Use  an  existing  repository  in  the  simulation,  with its existing configuration (trust level,
              groups, preferred and required content, maxsize, and the groupwanted configuration of its groups).

              The repository is given a name for the purposes of the simulation.  The repository to use  can  be
              specified by remote name, uuid, etc.  Example: "use myrepo here"

       <b>visit</b> <b>repo</b> <b>[command]</b>
              Runs the specified shell command inside the simulated repository, and waits for it to exit.

              When no shell command is specified, it runs an interactive shell.

              The  command is run in a git repository whosegit-annex branch contains the state of that simulated
              repository. This allows running any git-annex commands, such as <b>git-annex</b> <b>whereis</b> to  examine  the
              state of the simulation. You should avoid making any changes to git-annex state.

       <b>connect</b> <b>repo</b> <b>[&lt;-|-&gt;|&lt;-&gt;]</b> <b>repo</b> <b>[...]</b>
              Add  a  connection  between  two  or  more  repositories.  The arrow indicates which direction the
              connection runs, and it can be bidirectional. For example, "connect foo -&gt; bar"  makes  bar  be  a
              remote  of  foo,  while  "connect  foo  &lt;-&gt; bar" makes each be the remote of the other. A chain of
              connections can extend to many repositories, eg "connect foo -&gt; bar -&gt; baz -&gt; foo"

       <b>disconnect</b> <b>repo</b> <b>[&lt;-|-&gt;|&lt;-&gt;]</b> <b>repo</b> <b>[...]</b>
              Removes connections between repositories.

              For example, "disconnect foo -&gt; bar" makes foo no longer have bar as a remote.

       <b>addtree</b> <b>repo</b> <b>expression</b>
              Adds annexed files from the git repository to  the  simulation  making  them  be  present  in  the
              specified repository.

              The  expression  is a preferred content expression (see <a href="../man1/git-annex-preferred-content.1.html">git-annex-preferred-content</a>(1)) specifying
              which annexed files to add. While it is possible to include all or a large number  of  files  this
              way,  note  that  often  it's  more  efficient to simulate a small quantity of files that have the
              particular properties you are interested in.

              When run in a subdirectory of the repository, only files in that subdirectory are  considered  for
              addition.

              This  can  be  used  with  the  same  files  more  than once, to make multiple repositories in the
              simulation contain the same files.

       <b>add</b> <b>filename</b> <b>size</b> <b>repo</b> <b>[repo</b> <b>...]</b>
              Create a simulated annexed file with the specified filename and  size,  that  is  present  in  the
              specified repository, or repositories.

              The size can be specified using any usual units, eg "10mb" or "3.3terabytes"

              The filename cannot contain a space.

              This stages a file in the index, so that regular git-annex commands can be used to query the state
              of  the  simulated  annexed  file.  If  there  is already an annexed file by that name, it will be
              overwritten with the new file.

              Note that the simulation does not cover adding conflicting files to  different  repositories.  The
              files in the simulation are the same across all simulated repositories.

       addmulti N suffix minsize maxsize repo [repo ...]
              Add multiple simulated annexed files, with random sizes in the range between minsize and maxsize.

              The files are named by combining the number, which starts at 1 and goes up to N, with the suffix.

              For example:

               addmulti 100 testfile.jpg 100kb 10mb foo

              That adds files named "1testfile.jpg", 2testfile.jpg", etc.

              Note  that adding a large number of files to the simulation can slow it down and make it use a lot
              of memory.

       <b>step</b> <b>N</b> Run the simulation forward by this many steps.

              On each step of the simulation, one file is  either  transferred  or  dropped,  according  to  the
              preferred content and other configuration.

              If  there  are  no  more  files that can be either transferred or dropped according to the current
              configuration, a message will be displayed to indicate that the simulation has stabilized.

              This also simulates git pull and git push being run in each repository, as needed in order to find
              additional things to do.

       <b>stepstable</b> <b>N</b>
              Run the simulation forward by this many steps, at which point it is expected to have stabilized.

              If the simulation does not stabilize, the command will exit with a nonzero exit state.

       <b>action</b> <b>repo</b> <b>getwanted</b> <b>remote</b>
              Simulate the repository getting files it wants from the remote.

       <b>action</b> <b>repo</b> <b>dropunwanted</b>
              Simulate the repository dropping files it does not want, when it is able to verify  enough  copies
              exist on remotes.

       <b>action</b> <b>repo</b> <b>dropunwantedfrom</b> <b>remote</b>
              Simulate  the  repository dropping files from the remote that the remote does not want, when it is
              able to verify enouh copies exist.

       <b>action</b> <b>repo</b> <b>sendwanted</b> <b>remote</b>
              Simulate the repository sending files that the remote wants to it.

       <b>action</b> <b>repo</b> <b>gitpush</b> <b>remote</b>
              Simulate the repository pushing the git-annex branch to the remote.

       <b>action</b> <b>repo</b> <b>gitpull</b> <b>remote</b>
              Simulate the repository pulling the git-annex branch from the remote.

       <b>action</b> <b>repo</b> <b>pull</b> <b>remote</b>
              Simulate the equivilant of <a href="../man1/git-annex-pull.1.html">git-annex-pull</a>(1), by combining the  actions  gitpull,  getwanted,  and
              dropunwanted.

       <b>action</b> <b>repo</b> <b>push</b> <b>remote</b>
              Simulate   the   equivilant   of   <a href="../man1/git-annex-push.1.html">git-annex-push</a>(1)   by   combining   the   actions  sendwanted,
              dropunwantedfrom, and gitpush.

       <b>action</b> <b>repo</b> <b>sync</b> <b>remote</b>
              Simulate the  equivilant  of  <a href="../man1/git-annex-sync.1.html">git-annex-sync</a>(1)  by  combining  the  actions  gitpull,  getwanted,
              sendwanted, dropunwanted, and gitpush.

       <b>action</b> <b>[...]</b> <b>while</b> <b>action</b> <b>[...]</b>
              Simulate  running  the  two actions concurrently. While the simulation only actually simulates one
              thing happening at a time, when  the  actions  each  operate  on  multiple  files,  they  will  be
              interleaved randomly.

              Any number of actions can be combined this way.

              For example:

               action foo dropunwanted while action bar getwanted foo

              In this example, bar may or may not get a file before foo drops it.

       <b>seed</b> <b>N</b> Sets  the  random  seed  to  a  given number. Using this should make the results of the simulation
              deterministic. The output sim file always has the random seed included in it, so it can be used to
              replay the simulation.

       <b>present</b> <b>repo</b> <b>file</b>
              This indicates the expected state of the simulation at this point. The repository  should  contain
              the  content of the file. If it does not, the discrepancy will be indicated on standard error, and
              the <b>git-annex</b> <b>sim</b> command will eventually exit nonzero.

              This is added to the output sim file as the simulation runs.

       <b>notpresent</b> <b>repo</b> <b>file</b>
              This indicates the expected state of the simulation at  this  point.  The  repository  should  not
              contain  the content of the file. If it does, the discrepancy will be indicated on standard error,
              and the <b>git-annex</b> <b>sim</b> command will eventually exit nonzero.

              This is added to the output sim file as the simulation runs.

       <b>numcopies</b> <b>N</b>
              Sets the desired number of copies. This is equivilant to <a href="../man1/git-annex-numcopies.1.html">git-annex-numcopies</a>(1).

              Note that other configuration that sets numcopies, such as .gitattributes files, is  not  used  by
              the simulation.

       <b>mincopies</b> <b>N</b>
              Sets the minimum number of copies. This is equivilant to <a href="../man1/git-annex-mincopies.1.html">git-annex-mincopies</a>(1).

       <b>trustlevel</b> <b>repo</b> <b>trusted|untrusted|semitrusted|dead</b>
              Sets  the  trust  level  of  the  repository.  This  is  equivilant  to  <a href="../man1/git-annex-trust.1.html">git-annex-trust</a>(1),  <a href="../man1/gitannex-untrust.1.html">git-</a>
              <a href="../man1/gitannex-untrust.1.html">annex-untrust</a>(1), etc.

       <b>wanted</b> <b>repo</b> <b>expression</b>
              Configure the preferred content of a repository. This is equivilant to <a href="../man1/git-annex-wanted.1.html">git-annex-wanted</a>(1).

       <b>required</b> <b>repo</b> <b>expression</b>
              Configure the required content of a repository. This is equivilant to <a href="../man1/git-annex-required.1.html">git-annex-required</a>(1).

       <b>groupwanted</b> <b>group</b> <b>expression</b>
              Configure the groupwanted expression. This is equivilant to <a href="../man1/git-annex-groupwanted.1.html">git-annex-groupwanted</a>(1).

       <b>randomwanted</b> <b>repo</b> <b>term...</b>
              Configure the preferred content of a repository to a random expression generated  by  combining  a
              random selection of the provided terms with "and", "or", and "not".

              For  example,  "randomwanted  foo  exclude=*.x  include=*.x  largerthan=100kb"  might  generate an
              expression of "exclude=*.x or not largerthan=100kb  and  include=*.x"  or  it  might  generate  an
              expression of "include=*.x and exclude=*.x"

       <b>randomrequired</b> <b>repo</b> <b>term...</b>
              Configure the required content of a repository to a random expression.

       <b>randomgroupwanted</b> <b>group</b> <b>term...</b>
              Configure the groupwanted to a random expression.

       <b>group</b> <b>repo</b> <b>group</b>
              Add a repository to a group. This is equivilant to <a href="../man1/git-annex-group.1.html">git-annex-group</a>(1).

       <b>ungroup</b> <b>repo</b> <b>group</b>
              Remove a repository from a group. This is equivilant to <a href="../man1/git-annex-ungroup.1.html">git-annex-ungroup</a>(1).

       <b>metadata</b> <b>filename</b> <b>expression</b>
              Change  the  metadata  of  the  simulated  file. The expression is in the same format as the --set
              option of the git-annex-metadata command. For example: <b>metadata</b> <b>foo</b> <b>year=2025</b>

       <b>maxsize</b> <b>repo</b> <b>size</b>
              Configure the maximum size of a repository. This is equivilant to <a href="../man1/git-annex-maxsize.1.html">git-annex-maxsize</a>(1).

       <b>rebalance</b> <b>[on|off]</b>
              Setting "rebalance on" is the equivilant of passing the --rebalance option to  git-annex.  Setting
              "rebalance off" undoes that.

              For example:

               maxsize foo 1tb
               rebalance on
               step 100
               rebalance off

       <b>clusternode</b> <b>name</b> <b>repo</b>
              Simulate  a  repository  being  a  node of a cluster, which can be referred to using the specified
              name.

              Rather than a cluster gateway being simulated as a separate entity, any connection  to  a  cluster
              node with that name is treated as accessing that repository via the same cluster gateway.

              Since  a  cluster  gateway knows about all changes that are made to nodes via it, every repository
              that has a connection to a cluster node will immediately know about changes that are made via that
              node, without needing a simulated git pull.

              To simulate a repository being a node of more than one cluster, or behind multiple gateways in the
              same cluster, use this command to give it multiple names.
