</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           ipmctl show [OPTIONS] -system -capabilities

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Shows the capabilities of the current platform as determined by platform firmware (BIOS) and this
       application.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

           Shows all attributes.

           <b>Note</b>

           The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

       -d (attributes), -display (attributes)
           Filters the returned attributes by explicitly specifying a comma separated list of any of the

           Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

           <b>Note</b>

           The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

       -o (text|nvmxml), -output (text|nvmxml)
           Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Displays the supported PMem module capabilities

           ipmctl show -system -capabilities

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       The default behavior is to return the default attributes listed below; the options can be used to expand
       or restrict the output.

       PlatformConfigSupported
           (Default) Whether the platform level configuration of PMem modules can be modified with the host
           software. One of:

           •   0: Changes must be made in the BIOS.

           •   1: The command [Create Memory Allocation Goal] is supported.

       Alignment
           (Default) Capacity alignment requirement for all memory types as reported by the BIOS.

       AllowedVolatileMode
           (Default) The volatile mode allowed as determined by BIOS setup. One of:

           •   1LM: One-level volatile mode. All configured PMem module resources on the platform assigned for
               memory usage are not in use.

           •   2LM: Two-level volatile mode/Memory Mode. PMem module resources configured as memory act as
               system memory. Any DDR on the platform will act as a cache working in conjunction with the PMem
               modules.

           •   Unknown: The allowed volatile mode cannot be determined.

       CurrentVolatileMode
           (Default) The current volatile mode. One of:

           •   1LM: One-level volatile mode. All configured PMem module resources on the platform assigned for
               memory usage are not in use.

           •   2LM: Two-level volatile mode/Memory Mode. PMem module resources configured as memory act as
               system memory. Any DDR on the platform will act as a cache working in conjunction with the PMem
               modules.

           •   Unknown: The current volatile mode cannot be determined.

       AllowedAppDirectMode
           (Default) The App Direct mode allowed as determined by BIOS setup. One of:

           •   Disabled: App Direct support is currently disabled by the BIOS.

           •   App Direct: App Direct support is currently enabled by the BIOS.

           •   Unknown: The current App Direct support cannot be determined.

       ModesSupported
           A list of PMem module modes supported by the BIOS. Refer to the command [Show Dimm] to determine the

           •   1LM: One-level volatile mode. All configured PMem module resources on the platform assigned for
               memory usage are not in use.

           •   2LM: Two-level volatile mode/Memory Mode. PMem module resources configured as memory act as
               system memory. Any DDR on the platform will act as a cache working in conjunction with the PMem
               modules.

           •   App Direct: PMem module resources are under direct load/store control of the application. DDR is
               unaffected.
