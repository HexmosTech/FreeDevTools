</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cap - tool to perform capistrano tasks

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cap</b> &lt;command&gt; [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       cap  â€” cap is an utility to invoke capistrano tasks.  Capistrano is a utility and framework for executing
       commands in parallel on multiple remote machines, via SSH. It uses a simple DSL (borrowed  in  part  from
       Rake,  <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">http://rake.rubyforge.org/</a>) that allows you to define _tasks_, which may be applied to machines in
       certain roles. It also supports tunneling connections via some gateway machine to allow operations to  be
       performed behind VPN's and firewalls.

       Capistrano was originally designed to simplify and automate deployment of web applications to distributed
       environments,  and originally came bundled with a set of tasks designed for deploying Rails applications.
       The deployment tasks are now (as of Capistrano 2.0) opt-in and require clients to  explicitly  put  "load
       'deploy'" in their recipes.

       Capistrano  is   a  self-documenting program by giving you an extensive help listing for each command. If
       you think that this manual page is outdated, simply running

       cap -h

</pre><h4><b>ASSUMPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Capistrano is "opinionated software", which means it has very firm ideas about how  things  ought  to  be
       done, and tries to force those ideas on you. Some of the assumptions behind these opinions are:

         * You are using SSH to access the remote servers.
         *  You  either have the same password to all target machines, or you have public keys in place to allow
       passwordless access to them.

       Do not expect these assumptions to change.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Capistrano  is extensible configurable, and it has the following configuration options:

       <b>-e</b>           <b>--explain</b> <b>TAKS</b>
                 Displays help (if available) for the task.

       <b>-F</b>           <b>--default-config</b>
                 Always use default config, even with -f.

       <b>-f</b>           <b>--file</b> <b>FILE</b>
                 A recipe file to load. May be given more than once.

       <b>-H</b>           <b>--long-help</b>
                 Explain these options.

       <b>-h</b>           <b>--help</b>
                 Display this help message.

       <b>-p</b>           <b>--password</b>
                 Immediately prompt for the password.

       <b>-q</b>           <b>--quiet</b>
                 Make the output as quiet as possible.

       <b>-S</b>           <b>--set-before</b> <b>NAME=VALUE</b>
                 Set a variable before the recipes are loaded.

       <b>-s</b>           <b>--set</b> <b>NAME=VALUE</b>
                 Set a variable after the recipes are loaded.

       <b>-T</b>           <b>--taks</b>
                 List all tasks in the loaded recipe files.

       <b>-V</b>           <b>--version</b>
                 Display the Capistrano version, and exit.

       <b>-v</b>           <b>--verbose</b>
