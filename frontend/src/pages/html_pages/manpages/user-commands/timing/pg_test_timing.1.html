       pg_test_timing - measure timing overhead

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>pg_test_timing</b> [<u>option</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pg_test_timing is a tool to measure the timing overhead on your system and confirm that the system time
       never moves backwards. Systems that are slow to collect timing data can give less accurate <b>EXPLAIN</b>
       <b>ANALYZE</b> results.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       pg_test_timing accepts the following command-line options:

       <b>-d</b> <u>duration</u>
       <b>--duration=</b><u>duration</u>
           Specifies the test duration, in seconds. Longer durations give slightly better accuracy, and are more
           likely to discover problems with the system clock moving backwards. The default test duration is 3
           seconds.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
           Print the pg_test_timing version and exit.

       <b>-?</b>
       <b>--help</b>
           Show help about pg_test_timing command line arguments, and exit.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Interpreting</b> <b>Results</b>
       Good results will show most (&gt;90%) individual timing calls take less than one microsecond. Average per
       loop overhead will be even lower, below 100 nanoseconds. This example from an Intel i7-860 system using a
       TSC clock source shows excellent performance:

           Testing timing overhead for 3 seconds.
           Per loop time including overhead: 35.96 ns
           Histogram of timing durations:
             &lt; us   % of total      count
                1     96.40465   80435604
                2      3.59518    2999652
                4      0.00015        126
                8      0.00002         13
               16      0.00000          2

       Note that different units are used for the per loop time than the histogram. The loop can have resolution
       within a few nanoseconds (ns), while the individual timing calls can only resolve down to one microsecond
       (us).

   <b>Measuring</b> <b>Executor</b> <b>Timing</b> <b>Overhead</b>
       When the query executor is running a statement using <b>EXPLAIN</b> <b>ANALYZE</b>, individual operations are timed as
       well as showing a summary. The overhead of your system can be checked by counting rows with the psql
       program:

           CREATE TABLE t AS SELECT * FROM generate_series(1,100000);
           \timing
           SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t;
           EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t;

       The i7-860 system measured runs the count query in 9.8 ms while the <b>EXPLAIN</b> <b>ANALYZE</b> version takes 16.6
       ms, each processing just over 100,000 rows. That 6.8 ms difference means the timing overhead per row is
       68 ns, about twice what pg_test_timing estimated it would be. Even that relatively small amount of
       overhead is making the fully timed count statement take almost 70% longer. On more substantial queries,
       the timing overhead would be less problematic.

   <b>Changing</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Sources</b>
       On some newer Linux systems, it's possible to change the clock source used to collect timing data at any
       time. A second example shows the slowdown possible from switching to the slower acpi_pm time source, on
       the same system used for the fast results above:

           # cat <a href="file:/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource">/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource</a>
           tsc hpet acpi_pm
           # echo acpi_pm &gt; <a href="file:/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource">/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource</a>
           # pg_test_timing
           Per loop time including overhead: 722.92 ns
           Histogram of timing durations:
             &lt; us   % of total      count
                1     27.84870    1155682
                2     72.05956    2990371
                4      0.07810       3241
                8      0.01357        563
               16      0.00007          3

       In this configuration, the sample <b>EXPLAIN</b> <b>ANALYZE</b> above takes 115.9 ms. That's 1061 ns of timing
       overhead, again a small multiple of what's measured directly by this utility. That much timing overhead
       means the actual query itself is only taking a tiny fraction of the accounted for time, most of it is
       being consumed in overhead instead. In this configuration, any <b>EXPLAIN</b> <b>ANALYZE</b> totals involving many
       timed operations would be inflated significantly by timing overhead.

       FreeBSD also allows changing the time source on the fly, and it logs information about the timer selected
       during boot:

           # dmesg | grep "Timecounter"
           Timecounter "ACPI-fast" frequency 3579545 Hz quality 900
           Timecounter "i8254" frequency 1193182 Hz quality 0
           Timecounters tick every 10.000 msec
           Timecounter "TSC" frequency 2531787134 Hz quality 800
           # sysctl kern.timecounter.hardware=TSC
           kern.timecounter.hardware: ACPI-fast -&gt; TSC

       Other systems may only allow setting the time source on boot. On older Linux systems the "clock" kernel
       setting is the only way to make this sort of change. And even on some more recent ones, the only option
       you'll see for a clock source is "jiffies". Jiffies are the older Linux software clock implementation,
       which can have good resolution when it's backed by fast enough timing hardware, as in this example:

           $ cat <a href="file:/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource">/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource</a>
           jiffies
           $ dmesg | grep time.c
           time.c: Using 3.579545 MHz WALL PM GTOD PIT/TSC timer.
           time.c: Detected 2400.153 MHz processor.
           $ pg_test_timing
           Testing timing overhead for 3 seconds.
           Per timing duration including loop overhead: 97.75 ns
           Histogram of timing durations:
             &lt; us   % of total      count
                1     90.23734   27694571
                2      9.75277    2993204
                4      0.00981       3010
                8      0.00007         22
               16      0.00000          1
               32      0.00000          1

   <b>Clock</b> <b>Hardware</b> <b>and</b> <b>Timing</b> <b>Accuracy</b>
       Collecting accurate timing information is normally done on computers using hardware clocks with various
       levels of accuracy. With some hardware the operating systems can pass the system clock time almost
       directly to programs. A system clock can also be derived from a chip that simply provides timing
       interrupts, periodic ticks at some known time interval. In either case, operating system kernels provide
       a clock source that hides these details. But the accuracy of that clock source and how quickly it can
       return results varies based on the underlying hardware.

       Inaccurate time keeping can result in system instability. Test any change to the clock source very
       carefully. Operating system defaults are sometimes made to favor reliability over best accuracy. And if
       you are using a virtual machine, look into the recommended time sources compatible with it. Virtual
       hardware faces additional difficulties when emulating timers, and there are often per operating system
       settings suggested by vendors.

       The Time Stamp Counter (TSC) clock source is the most accurate one available on current generation CPUs.
       It's the preferred way to track the system time when it's supported by the operating system and the TSC
       clock is reliable. There are several ways that TSC can fail to provide an accurate timing source, making
       it unreliable. Older systems can have a TSC clock that varies based on the CPU temperature, making it
       unusable for timing. Trying to use TSC on some older multicore CPUs can give a reported time that's
       inconsistent among multiple cores. This can result in the time going backwards, a problem this program
       checks for. And even the newest systems can fail to provide accurate TSC timing with very aggressive
       power saving configurations.

       Newer operating systems may check for the known TSC problems and switch to a slower, more stable clock
       source when they are seen. If your system supports TSC time but doesn't default to that, it may be
       disabled for a good reason. And some operating systems may not detect all the possible problems
       correctly, or will allow using TSC even in situations where it's known to be inaccurate.

       The High Precision Event Timer (HPET) is the preferred timer on systems where it's available and TSC is
       not accurate. The timer chip itself is programmable to allow up to 100 nanosecond resolution, but you may
       not see that much accuracy in your system clock.

       Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) provides a Power Management (PM) Timer, which Linux
       refers to as the acpi_pm. The clock derived from acpi_pm will at best provide 300 nanosecond resolution.

       Timers used on older PC hardware include the 8254 Programmable Interval Timer (PIT), the real-time clock
       (RTC), the Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) timer, and the Cyclone timer. These timers
       aim for millisecond resolution.
