</pre><h4><b>ABOUT</b></h4><pre>
         Chronicle is a simple tool to convert a collection of text files,
        located within a single directory, into a blog consisting of static
        HTML files.

         It supports only the bare minimum of features which are required
        to be useful:

          * Tagging support.

          * RSS support.

          * Archive support.

         The obvious deficiencies are:

          * Lack of support for instant commenting.

          * Lack of pingback/trackback support.

         Having said that it is a robust, stable, and useful system.

</pre><h4><b>BLOG</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
         The format of the text files we process is critical to the output
        pages.  Each entry should look something like this:

           Title:  This is the title of the blog post
           Date:  2nd March 2007
           Tags: one, two, three, long tag

           The text of your entry goes here.

         NOTE: The header MUST be separated from the body of the entry by at least a
        single empty line.

         In this example we can see that the entry itself has been prefaced
        with a small header.  An entry header is contains three optional lines,
        if these are not present then there are sensible defaults as described
        below.

          The formatting of the output dates may be changed via the use of the
        B&lt;--lang&gt; command line option (or the matching "lang=french" option in the
        configuration file), but the date of the entry itself should be specified in
        English.

       Title: Describes the title of the post.  If not present the filename of the entry is used instead.
       "Subject:" may also be used.
       Subject: This is a synonym for 'Title:'.
       Date: The date the post was written.  If not present the creation time of the file is used instead.
       Publish: This header is removed from all entries, and is used by the chronicle-spooler script.
       Tags: Any tags which should be associated with the entry, separated by commas.

         The format of the entry is assumed to be HTML, however there is support
        for writing your entries in both textile and markdown formats.

         The format of entries is specified via the B&lt;--format&gt; argument, or
        via a "format: foo" setting in your chroniclerc file.

         The format of entries is assumed to be global; that is all your entries
        will be assumed to be in the same format.  However you can add a
        "format: foo" pseudo header to specific entries if you wish to write
        specific entries in a different format.

         To allow flexibility in the handling of entries each blog entry will
        be passed through the filter script B&lt;chronicle-entry-filter&gt;
        which allows you to modify this handling in a single location. This
        script allows entries to be updated via filters both before and after
        the conversion to HTML.  For further details please see the manpage for
        that script.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
         The configuration of the software is minimal, and generally performed
        via the command line arguments.  However it is possible to save settings
        either in the file global /etc/chroniclerc or the per-user <a href="file:~/.chroniclerc">~/.chroniclerc</a>
        file.

         If you wish you may pass the name of another configuration file to
        the script with the B&lt;--config&gt; flag.  This will be read after the
        previous two files, and may override any settings which are present.

         The configuration file contains lines like these:

          input  = /home/me/blog

          output = /var/www/blog

          format = markdown

         Keys which are unknown are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONAL</b> <b>CACHING</b></h4><pre>
         To speed the rebuilding of a large blog the compiler may use a local
        Memcached daemon, if installed and available.

         To install this, under a Debian GNU/Linux system please run:

           apt-get update
           apt-get install memcached libcache-memcached-perl

         You may disable this caching behaviour with --no-cache, and see the
        effect with --verbose.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONAL</b> <b>CALENDAR</b></h4><pre>
         If the 'HTML::CalendarMonthSimple' module is available each blog will
        contain a simple month-view of the current month upon the index.

         To disable this invoke the program with '--no-calendar'.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONAL</b> <b>COMMENTING</b></h4><pre>
         Included with the chronicle code you should find the file
        cgi-bin/comments.cgi.

         This file is designed to write submitted comments to the local
        filesystem of your web-server.  If you install that, and edit the
        path at the start of the script you should be able to include
        comments in your blog.

         In short there are three things you need to do:

       Install the CGI script and edit the path at the start.
       Copy the output comments to your local blog source.
       Run this script again with --comments=./path/to/comments

         This should include the comments in the static output.  More
        explicit instructions are provided within the file 'COMMENTS'
        included within the distribution.
