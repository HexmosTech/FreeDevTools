</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       regina-gui - Regina's graphical user interface

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>regina-gui</b> [ <u>file</u> <u>...</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Regina  is  a  software  package  for  studying 3-manifold triangulations and normal surfaces.  Other key
       features include angle structures, census enumeration, combinatorial recognition of  triangulations,  and
       high-level  tasks such as 3-sphere recognition and connected sum decomposition.  Regina comes with a full
       graphical user interface, and also offers Python bindings and a low-level C++ programming interface.

       This starts the full graphical user interface, and is the usual way of starting Regina.  Any files passed
       on the command-line will be opened on startup.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables influence the behaviour of this program.

       <u>REGINA_PYLIBDIR</u>
              The directory containing the Python module <u>regina</u>.

              If you have installed Regina's Python module in a  standard  Python  location  (i.e.,  Python  can
              import  it  directly  without  extending  sys.path),  then <u>REGINA_PYLIBDIR</u> should be left empty or
              undefined.

              Normally you should not need to set this option yourself.  This program should know  how  to  find
              Regina's Python module in standard situations, which include fixed filesystem installations (e.g.,
              <b>GNU/Linux</b>  and  <b>Windows</b>),  relocatable  app  bundles  (e.g., <b>macOS</b>), and running directly from the
              source tree.

       <u>REGINA_HOME</u>
              The directory beneath which Regina's data files  are  installed.   These  include  (amongst  other
              things)  example  files in <u>$REGINA_HOME/examples/</u>, API documentation in <u>$REGINA_HOME/engine-docs/</u>,
              and census databases in <u>$REGINA_HOME/data/census/</u>.

              Normally you should not need to set this option yourself.  This program should know  how  to  find
              its  data  files  in  standard  situations,  which  include  fixed filesystem installations (e.g.,
              <b>GNU/Linux</b> and <b>Windows</b>), relocatable app bundles (e.g.,  <b>macOS</b>),  and  running  directly  from  the
              source tree.

</pre><h4><b>MACOS</b> <b>USERS</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  downloaded  a  drag-and-drop  app  bundle,  this is the program that runs when you open it.  The
       executable itself is simply called <b>Regina</b>, not <b>regina-gui</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       regina-python.

       Regina comes with a rich users' handbook, which you can access via Help-&gt;Regina  Handbook  in  the  menu.
       You can also read the users' handbook online at <b><a href="http://regina-normal.github.io/docs/">http://regina-normal.github.io/docs/</a></b>.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       Many  people  have been involved in the development of Regina; see the users' handbook for a full list of
       credits.
