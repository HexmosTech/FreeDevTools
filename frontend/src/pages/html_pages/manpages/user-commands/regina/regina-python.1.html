       regina-python - Regina's command-line Python interface

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>regina-python</b> [ <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b> | <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b> ] [ <b>-n,</b> <b>--nolibs</b> ] [ <b>-a,</b> <b>--noautoimport</b> ]

       <b>regina-python</b> [ <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b> | <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b> ] [ <b>-n,</b> <b>--nolibs</b> ] [ <b>-a,</b> <b>--noautoimport</b> ] [ <b>-i,</b> <b>--interactive</b>
       ] <u>script</u> [ <u>script-args</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Regina  is  a  software  package  for  studying 3-manifold triangulations and normal surfaces.  Other key
       features include angle structures, census enumeration, combinatorial recognition of  triangulations,  and
       high-level  tasks such as 3-sphere recognition and connected sum decomposition.  Regina comes with a full
       graphical user interface, and also offers Python bindings and a low-level C++ programming interface.

       This command starts an interactive Python session  for  Regina.   This  will  be  a  command-line  Python
       session,  with  direct text input/output and no graphical user interface.  All of the objects, clases and
       methods from Regina's mathematical engine will be made available through the module <u>regina</u>, which will be
       imported on startup (effectively running import regina).  Moreover, unless the option  <b>--noautoimport</b>  is
       passed, all of Regina's objects, classes and methods will be imported directly into the current namespace
       (effectively running from regina import *).

       Instead  of  starting  an  interactive  Python  session,  you can pass a Python script (with arguments if
       desired).  In this case Regina will run the script (after first importing the  <u>regina</u>  module).   If  you
       pass  <b>--interactive</b>, Regina will leave you at a Python prompt once the script finishes; otherwise it will
       exit Python and return you to the command line.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-q</b>

       <b>--quiet</b>
              Start in quiet mode.  No output will be  produced  except  for  serious  errors.   In  particular,
              warnings will be suppressed.

              This is equivalent to setting the environment variable <u>REGINA_VERBOSITY</u>=0.

       <b>-v</b>

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Start in verbose mode.  Additional diagnostic information will be output.

              This is equivalent to setting the environment variable <u>REGINA_VERBOSITY</u>=2.

       <b>-a</b>

       <b>--noautoimport</b>
              Still  import  the <u>regina</u> module, but do not automatically import all of Regina's objects, classes
              and methods into the current namespace (that is, do not run from regina  import  *).   This  means
              that   (for   example)   the   main   3-manifold   triangulation   class   must   be  accessed  as
              regina.Triangulation3, not just Triangulation3.

       <b>-i</b>

       <b>--interactive</b>
              Run the script in interactive mode.  After executing the given script, Regina will  leave  you  in
              the Python interpreter to run your own additional commands.

              This option is only available when a script is passed.  If no script is passed, <b>regina-python</b> will
              always start in interactive mode.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following environment variables influence the behaviour of this program.  Most variables can also be
       set in the local configuration file <u><a href="file:~/.regina-python">~/.regina-python</a></u> using a line of the  form  <u>option</u>=<u>value</u>;  exceptions
       are noted below.  Environment variables take precedence over values in the configuration file.

       <u>REGINA_VERBOSITY</u>
              Specifies how much output should be generated.  Recognised values are:

              <b>0</b>      Display errors only; this is equivalent to passing the option <b>--quiet</b>.

              <b>1</b>      Display errors and warnings; this is the default.

              <b>2</b>      Display  errors,  warnings  and diagnostic output; this is equivalent to passing the option
                     <b>--verbose</b>.

       <u>REGINA_PYTHON</u>
              The command used to start the Python interpreter.

              In general you should use the same version of Python that  Regina  was  built  against;  otherwise
              Python might not be able to load the <u>regina</u> module.

              Normally  you  should  not need to set this option yourself.  By default, Regina will use the same
              Python installation that it was built against.

       <u>REGINA_PYLIBDIR</u>
              The directory containing the Python module <u>regina</u>.

              If you have installed Regina's Python module in a  standard  Python  location  (i.e.,  Python  can
              import  it  directly  without  extending  sys.path),  then <u>REGINA_PYLIBDIR</u> should be left empty or
              undefined.

              Normally you should not need to set this option yourself.  This program should know  how  to  find
              Regina's Python module in standard situations, which include fixed filesystem installations (e.g.,
              <b>GNU/Linux</b>  and  <b>Windows</b>),  relocatable  app  bundles  (e.g., <b>macOS</b>), and running directly from the
              source tree.

       <u>REGINA_HOME</u>
              The directory beneath which Regina's data files are installed.   In  particular,  Regina's  census
              lookup routines will look for the census databases in the subdirectory <u>$REGINA_HOME/data/census/</u>.

              This  option  can  only  be  set  from the environment: it cannot be set in the configuration file
              <u><a href="file:~/.regina-python">~/.regina-python</a></u>.

              Normally you should not need to set this option yourself.  This program should know  how  to  find
              its  data  files  in  standard  situations,  which  include  fixed filesystem installations (e.g.,
              <b>GNU/Linux</b> and <b>Windows</b>), relocatable app bundles (e.g.,  <b>macOS</b>),  and  running  directly  from  the
              source tree.

</pre><h4><b>MACOS</b> <b>USERS</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  downloaded a drag-and-drop app bundle, this utility is shipped inside it.  If you dragged Regina
       to the main Applications folder, you can run it as /Applications/Regina.app/Contents/MacOS/regina-python.

</pre><h4><b>WINDOWS</b> <b>USERS</b></h4><pre>
       The command <b>regina-python</b> is not available under <b>Windows</b>.  However, you can still use Python scripting in
       Regina's graphical user interface, by opening a graphical Python console or using script packets.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       regina-gui.

       Regina comes with thorough API documentation, which describes in detail all of the objects,  classes  and
       methods  that  Regina  makes available to Python.  You can access this documentation via Help-&gt;Python API
       Reference in the graphical user interface, or read it  online  at  <b><a href="http://regina-normal.github.io/engine">http://regina-normal.github.io/engine</a>-</b>
