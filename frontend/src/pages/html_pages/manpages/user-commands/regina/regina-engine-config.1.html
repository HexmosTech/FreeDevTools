</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       regina-engine-config - get information about the installed version of Regina

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>regina-engine-config</b> [<b>--prefix</b>[=<u>DIR</u>]] [<b>--exec-prefix</b>[=<u>DIR</u>]] [<b>--version</b>] [<b>--libs</b>] [<b>--cflags</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>regina-engine-config</u>  tells  you which compiler and linker flags should be used to build the mathematical
       engine of Regina into your own programs.  Regina's mathematical  engine  is  in  the  library  <u>libregina-</u>
       <u>engine.so</u>.

       Regina  is  a software package for 3-manifold and 4-manifold topologists, with a focus on triangulations,
       knots and links, normal surfaces, and angle structures.

       For 3-manifolds, it includes high-level tasks such as 3-sphere recognition, connected  sum  decomposition
       and  Hakenness  testing,  comes  with  a  rich database of census manifolds, and incorporates the SnapPea
       kernel for working with hyperbolic manifolds.  For 4-manifolds, it offers a range  of  combinatorial  and
       algebraic  tools,  plus  support  for  normal  hypersurfaces.   For  knots  and links, Regina can perform
       combinatorial manipulation, compute knot polynomials, and work with several import/export formats.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>regina-engine-config</u> accepts the following options.

       <b>--prefix</b>=<u>DIR</u>
              Use DIR instead of the installation prefix that Regina was built with when  computing  the  output
              for the --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used for the exec prefix if --exec-prefix
              is not specified.  This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.  If no DIR
              is specified then the current installation prefix will be written to standard output.

              Most people will not need this option.

       <b>--exec-prefix</b>=<u>DIR</u>
              Use  DIR  instead  of  the  installation exec prefix that Regina was built with when computing the
              output for the --cflags and --libs options.  This option must be specified before  any  --libs  or
              --cflags  options.   If  no  DIR  is  specified  then the current installation exec prefix will be
              written to standard output.

              Most people will not need this option.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the currently installed version of Regina.

       <b>--libs</b> Print the linker flags that are required to link a program against the Regina calculation engine.

       <b>--cflags</b>
              Print the compiler flags that are required to compile a program that uses the  Regina  calculation
              engine.
