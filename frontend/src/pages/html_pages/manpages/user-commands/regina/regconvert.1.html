</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       regconvert - Convert between different Regina file formats

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>regconvert</b> [ <b>-2</b> | <b>-3</b> ] [ <b>-x</b> | <b>-u</b> ] <u>old-file</u> [ <u>new-file</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This utility converts back and forth between different Regina file formats.

       Regina's file formats include:

       <b>Third-generation</b> <b>XML</b>
              This  is  the  modern  XML  format  introduced in Regina 7.0.  Older versions of Regina (6.0.1 and
              below) cannot read it at all.

       <b>Second-generation</b> <b>XML</b>
              This is the original XML format that was used  in  Regina  3.0-6.0.1  (from  2002-2021).   Current
              versions of Regina can still read and write this format if required.

       <b>First-generation</b> <b>binary</b> <b>format</b>
              This  is the ancient binary format that was used in Regina 2.x (from 2000-2002).  Support for this
              format was dropped completely in September 2013, and modern versions  of  Regina  cannot  read  or
              write it.

              If  you  still  have  ancient  files  that  use  this  format,  you  will  need  to find a copy of
              Regina 3.0-4.93 (from 2002-2012), which  can  convert  these  old  binary  files  to  the  second-
              generation XML format.

       The argument <u>old-file</u> should be the file to read and convert; the argument <u>new-file</u> should be the name of
       the new converted file to write.  These two filenames may be the same, in which case the old file will be
       replaced with the new.

       If  the  argument  <u>new-file</u> is missing then the new file will be written to standard output, which forces
       the output to be uncompressed XML (see option <b>-u</b>).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-2</b>     Convert to the older second-generation XML format, as used in Regina 3.0-6.0.1.

       <b>-3</b> <b>(default)</b>
              Convert to the modern third-generation XML format, introduced in Regina 7.0.

       <b>-x</b> <b>(default)</b>
              Write the output as compressed XML.

       <b>-u</b>     Write the output as uncompressed (plain text) XML.

</pre><h4><b>MACOS</b> <b>USERS</b></h4><pre>
       If you downloaded a drag-and-drop app bundle, this utility is shipped inside it.  If you  dragged  Regina
       to the main Applications folder, you can run it as /Applications/Regina.app/Contents/MacOS/regconvert.

</pre><h4><b>WINDOWS</b> <b>USERS</b></h4><pre>
       The  command-line  utilities  are  installed  beneath  the <u>Program</u> <u>Files</u> directory; on some machines this
       directory   is   called   <u>Program</u>   <u>Files</u>   <u>(x86)</u>.    You   can   start   this   utility    by    running
       c:\Program Files\Regina\Regina 7.0\bin\regconvert.exe.
