       apt-transport-mirror - APT transport for more automated mirror selection

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This APT transport isn't implementing a protocol to access local or remote repositories on its own, but
       acquires a mirrorlist and redirects all requests to the mirror(s) picked from this list, accessing them
       via other transports like <b><a href="../man1/apt-transport-http.1.html">apt-transport-http</a></b>(1). The basic functionality has been available since apt
       0.7.24, but was undocumented until apt 1.6 which contained a complete rework of the transport and its
       supported features. Note that a transport is never called directly by a user but used by APT tools based
       on user configuration.

       If the acquisition of a file via a mirror fails, the method ensures that another possible mirror from the
       list is automatically tried until either the file is retrieved or no mirror is left in the list,
       transparently handling server downtimes and similar problems.

       The security implications of the transport depend on the security considerations associated with the
       transport used to acquire the mirrorlist and the transports involved in accessing the chosen mirror(s) by
       the transport.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This transport has no configuration options at present. The mirror selection is based entirely on the
       mirrors offered in the mirrorlist and the files APT needs to acquire.

   <b>Mirrorlist</b> <b>format</b>
       A mirrorlist contains one or more lines each specifying a URI for a mirror. Empty lines and those
       starting with a hash character (#) are ignored. A URI always starts with a URI scheme which defines the
       transport used for this mirror. If for example the URI starts with http:, the responsible transport is
       <b><a href="../man1/apt-transport-http.1.html">apt-transport-http</a></b>(1) which might have specific requirements for the format of the remaining part of the
       URI.

       Metadata about a mirror can be given on the same line, separated from the URI by a tab. Multiple items of
       metadata can themselves be separated by either tabs or spaces. (This is an advanced feature only
       available with apt &gt;= 1.6. Earlier apt versions will fail to parse mirrorlists using this feature.)

       Since apt 1.6 the use of compressed mirrorlists is also supported. Note that the filename of the
       mirrorlist must specify the compression algorithm used; there is no auto-detection based on file
       contents.

   <b>Mirror</b> <b>selection</b> <b>by</b> <b>metadata</b>
       As specified in the format, a mirror can have additional metadata attached to prevent a mirror from being
       selected for acquiring a file not matching this metadata. This way the mirrorlist can e.g. contain
       partial mirrors serving only certain architectures and APT will automatically choose a different mirror
       for files requiring an unlisted architecture. Supported are limits for the architecture (arch), codename
       of the release (codename), component of the repository the file is in (component), language the file
       applies to (lang), suite name of the release (suite) and type of the file (type).

   <b>Fallback</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>mirrors</b>
       If no priority is given for a mirror via the metadata key priority, the order in which mirrors are
       contacted is random. If a certain set of mirrors should be tried first before any of another set is
       tried, a priority can be explicitly set. The mirrors with the lowest number are tried first. Mirrors
       which have no explicit priority set default to the highest possible number and are therefore tried last.
       The choice between mirrors with the same priority is again random.

   <b>Allowed</b> <b>transports</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirrorlist</b>
       The availability and choice of transports in a mirrorlist is limited by how the APT client is accessing
       the mirrorlist. If a local transport like file or copy is used, the mirrorlist can also include local
       sources, while a mirrorlist accessed via http can not. Additionally, a mirrorlist can not contain a
       mirrorlist or other wrapping transports (like apt-transport-tor). See the documentation of these
       transports on how to use them with the mirror method.

       Note that apt versions before 1.6 do not support any other transport than http.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Basic</b> <b>example</b>
       A basic mirrorlist example supported by all apt versions with a mirror method (&gt;= 0.7.24) in which the
       client will pick any of the three mirrors:

           <a href="http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/">http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/</a>
           <a href="http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/">http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/</a>
           <a href="http://deb.debian.org/debian/">http://deb.debian.org/debian/</a>

       Assuming a file with this content is stored as /etc/apt/mirrorlist.txt on your machine it can be used
       like this in <b><a href="../man5/sources.list.5.html">sources.list</a></b>(5) (since apt 1.6):

           deb mirror+file:/etc/apt/mirrorlist.txt trixie main

       All versions of the mirror method support a mirrorlist accessible via HTTP, so assuming it is available
       at <a href="http://apt.example.org/mirror.lst">http://apt.example.org/mirror.lst</a> the sources.list entry from above could instead be written as:

           deb mirror://apt.example.org/mirror.lst trixie main

       Note that since apt 1.6 the use of mirror+http should be preferred over mirror for uniformity. The
       functionality is the same.

   <b>Example</b> <b>with</b> <b>metadata-enhanced</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>selection</b>
       As explained in the format definition apt versions before 1.6 do not support this and will fail parsing
       the mirrorlist. The example mirrorlist is intentionally complicated to show some aspects of the
       selection. The following setup is assumed: The first mirror is a local mirror accessible via the file
       method, but potentially incomplete. The second mirror has a great connection, but is a partial mirror
       insofar as it only contains files related to the architectures amd64 and all. The remaining mirrors are
       average mirrors which should be contacted only if the earlier ones didn't work.

           file:/srv/local/debian/mirror/     priority:1 type:index
           <a href="http://partial.example.org/mirror/">http://partial.example.org/mirror/</a> priority:2 arch:amd64 arch:all type:deb
           <a href="http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/">http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/</a>   type:deb
           <a href="http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/">http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/</a>   type:deb
           https://deb.debian.org/debian/

       In this setup with this mirrorlist the first mirror will be used to download all index files assuming the
       mirrorlist itself is accessed via a local transport like file. If it isn't, if the mirror is otherwise
       inaccessible or if it does not contain the requested file another mirror will be used to acquire the
       file, chosen depending on the type of the file: An index file will be served by the last mirror in the
       list, while a package of architecture amd64 is served by the second and those of e.g. architecture i386
       by one of the last three.
