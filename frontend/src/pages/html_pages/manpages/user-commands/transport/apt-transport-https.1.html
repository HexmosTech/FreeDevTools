</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       apt-transport-https - APT transport for downloading via the HTTP Secure protocol (HTTPS)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This APT transport allows the use of repositories accessed via the HTTP Secure protocol (HTTPS), also
       referred to as HTTP over TLS. It is available by default since apt 1.5 and was available before that in
       the package apt-transport-https. Note that a transport is never called directly by a user but used by APT
       tools based on user configuration.

       HTTP is by itself an unencrypted transport protocol (compare <b><a href="../man1/apt-transport-http.1.html">apt-transport-http</a></b>(1)), which, as indicated
       by the appended S, is wrapped in an encrypted layer known as Transport Layer Security (TLS) to provide
       end-to-end encryption. A sufficiently capable attacker can still observe the communication partners and
       deeper analysis of the encrypted communication might still reveal important details. An overview over
       available alternative transport methods is given in <b><a href="../man5/sources.list.5.html">sources.list</a></b>(5).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The HTTPS protocol is based on the HTTP protocol, so all options supported by <b><a href="../man1/apt-transport-http.1.html">apt-transport-http</a></b>(1) are
       also available via Acquire::https and will default to the same values specified for Acquire::http. This
       manpage will only document the options <u>unique</u> <u>to</u> <u>https</u>.

   <b>Server</b> <b>credentials</b>
       By default all certificates trusted by the system (see ca-certificates package) are used for the
       verification of the server certificate. An alternative certificate authority (CA) can be configured with
       the Acquire::https::CAInfo option and its host-specific option Acquire::https::CAInfo::<u>host</u>. The CAInfo
       option specifies a file made up of CA certificates (in PEM format) concatenated together to create the
       chain which APT should use to verify the path from your self-signed root certificate. If the remote
       server provides the whole chain during the exchange, the file need only contain the root certificate.
       Otherwise, the whole chain is required. If you need to support multiple authorities, the only way is to
       concatenate everything.

       A custom certificate revocation list (CRL) can be configured with the options Acquire::https::CRLFile and
       Acquire::https::CRLFile::<u>host</u>. As with the previous option, a file in PEM format needs to be specified.

   <b>Disabling</b> <b>security</b>
       During server authentication, if certificate verification fails for some reason (expired, revoked, man in
       the middle, etc.), the connection fails. This is obviously what you want in all cases and what the
       default value (true) of the option Acquire::https::Verify-Peer and its host-specific variant provides. If
       you know <u>exactly</u> what you are doing, setting this option to "false" allows you to skip peer certificate
       verification and make the exchange succeed. Again, this option is for debugging or testing purposes only
       as it removes all security provided by the use of HTTPS.

       Similarly the option Acquire::https::Verify-Host and its host-specific variant can be used to deactivate
       a security feature: The certificate provided by the server includes the identity of the server which
       should match the DNS name used to access it. By default, as requested by RFC 2818, the name of the mirror
       is checked against the identity found in the certificate. This default behavior is safe and should not be
       changed, but if you know that the server you are using has a DNS name which does not match the identity
       in its certificate, you can set the option to "false", which will prevent the comparison from being
       performed.

   <b>Client</b> <b>authentication</b>
       Besides supporting password-based authentication (see <b><a href="../man5/apt_auth.conf.5.html">apt_auth.conf</a></b>(5)) HTTPS also supports
       authentication based on client certificates via Acquire::https::SSLCert and Acquire::https::SSLKey. These
       should be set respectively to the filename of the X.509 client certificate and the associated
       (unencrypted) private key, both in PEM format. In practice the use of the host-specific variants of both
       options is highly recommended.
