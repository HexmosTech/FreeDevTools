       poster - Scale and tile a postscript image to print on multiple pages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       poster &lt;options&gt; infile

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Poster</u>  can  be  used  to  create a large poster by building it from multiple pages and/or printing it on
       large media.  It expects as input a generic (encapsulated) postscript file, normally printing on a single
       page.  The output is again a postscript file, maybe  containing  multiple  pages  together  building  the
       poster.   The output pages bear cutmarks and have slightly overlapping images for easier assembling.  The
       input picture will be scaled to obtain the desired size.

       The program uses a brute-force method: it copies the entire input file for each output  page,  hence  the
       output  file  can be very large.  Since the program does not really bother about the input file contents,
       it clearly works for both black-and-white and color postscript.

       To control its operation, you need to specify either the size of the desired poster or a scale factor for
       the image:

       - Given the poster size, it calculates the required number of sheets to print on, and from that  a  scale
         factor to fill these sheets optimally with the input image.

       - Given  a scale factor, it derives the required number of pages from the input image size, and positions
         the scaled image centered on this area.

       Its input file should best be a real `Encapsulated Postscript' file (often  denoted  with  the  extension
       .eps  or  .epsf).   Such  files  can  be  generated from about all current drawing applications, and text
       processors like Word, Interleaf and Framemaker.
       However <u>poster</u> tries to behave properly also on more  relaxed,  general  postscript  files  containing  a
       single  page  definition.   Proper  operation  is obtained for instance on pages generated by (La)TeX and
       (g)troff.

       The media to print on can be selected independently from the input image size  and/or  the  poster  size.
       <u>Poster</u> will determine by itself whether it is beneficial to rotate the output image on the media.

       To  preview  the  output results of <u>poster</u> and/or to (re-)print individual output pages, you should use a
       postscript previewer like <a href="../man1/ghostview.1.html">ghostview</a>(1).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -v Be verbose. Tell about scaling, rotation and number of pages.
          Default is silent operation.

       -f Ask manual media feed on the plotting/printing device, instead of using its standard paper tray.
          Default is adhering to the device settings.

       -i &lt;box&gt;
          Specify the size of the input image.
          Default is reading the image size from the `%%BoundingBox' specification in the input file header.

       -m &lt;box&gt;
          Specify the desired media size to print on. See below for &lt;box&gt;.
          The default is obtained from the PAPERCONF environment variable.  If it is not set, it  is  read  from
          the  file whose name is in the PAPERSIZE environment variable.  If that too is not set, the default is
          read from the file /etc/papersize.  See <b><a href="../man5/papersize.5.html">papersize</a></b>(5) for a full  description  of  the  format  of  the
          config file.

       -p &lt;box&gt;
          Specify  the  poster  size.  See below for &lt;box&gt;.  Since <u>poster</u> will autonomously choose for rotation,
          always specify a `portrait' poster size (i.e. higher then wide).
          If you don't give the -s option, the default poster size is identical to the media size.

       -s &lt;number&gt;
          Specify a linear scaling factor to produce the  poster.   Together  with  the  input  image  size  and
          optional margins, this induces an output poster size. So don't specify both -s and -p.
          Default is deriving the scale factor to fit a given poster size.

       -c &lt;box&gt; <u>or</u> -c &lt;number&gt;%
          Specify the cut margin. This is the distance between the cutmarks and the paper edge. If the output is
          really  tiled  on  multiple  sheets, the cut marks indicate where to cut the paper for assembly.  This
          margin must be big enough to cover the non-printable margin which almost all printers have. For  &lt;box&gt;
          see below.
          Default  is 5%. Only when you specify identical poster and media sizes, the default cut margin becomes
          0, effectively removing the cutmarks.

       -w &lt;box&gt; <u>or</u> -w &lt;number&gt;%
          Specify a white margin around the output image.
          In the `ideal' situation (when an input `eps' file specifies an exact BoundingBox in its header),  the
          output  image  will  be scaled exactly to the edges of the resulting poster (minus cut margin). If you
          desire a certain margin to remain around the picture after poster assembly, you can specify this  with
          `-w'.
          (This  option is actually redundant, since you can obtain the same result using -s or -i. However some
          might find this more convenient.)
          Default is 0.

       -P &lt;pagespec&gt;
          Specify which pages of the poster to print. It consists of a comma-separated list of single  pages  or
          page  ranges  (using the dash). The order in which page number appears determines the final page order
          in the result PostScript file. Page numbering starts at 1, from right to left and bottom-up.
          Examples: 1-2 or 1,3-4,7

       -o &lt;outputfile&gt;
          Specify the name of the file to write the output into.
          (Only added for those poor people who cannot specify output redirection from their command line due to
          a silly OS.)
          Default is writing to standard output.

       The &lt;box&gt; mentioned above is a specification of horizontal and vertical size.  Only in  combination  with
       the `-i' option, the program also understands the offset specification in the &lt;box&gt;.
       In general:
            &lt;box&gt; = [&lt;multiplier&gt;][&lt;offset&gt;]&lt;unit&gt;
       with multiplier and offset being specified optionally.
            &lt;multiplier&gt; = &lt;number&gt;*&lt;number&gt;
            &lt;offset&gt; = +&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;
            &lt;unit&gt; = &lt;medianame&gt; or &lt;distancename&gt;

       Many  international  media  names  are  recognised  by  the  program, in upper and lower case, and can be
       shortened to their first few characters, as long as unique.  For instance `A0', `Let'.
       Distance names are like `cm', `i', `ft'.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following command prints an A4 input file on 8 A3 pages, forming an A0 poster:
                poster -v -iA4 -mA3 -pA0 infile &gt;outfile

       The next command prints an eps input image on a poster of 3x3 Letter pages:
                poster -v -mLet -p3x3Let  image.eps &gt; outfile

       The next command enlarges an eps input image to print on a large-media A0 capable device,  maintaining  2
       inch margins:
                poster -v -mA0 -w2x2i image.eps &gt; outfile

       Enlarge  a  postscript image exactly 4 times, print on the default A4 media, and let <u>poster</u> determine the
       number of pages required:
                poster -v -s4 image.eps &gt; outfile

       Scale a postscript image to a poster of about 1 square meter, printing on `Legal'  media,  maintaining  a
       10% of `Legal' size as white margin around the poster.
                poster -v -mLegal -p1x1m -w10% infile.ps &gt;outfile

</pre><h4><b>PROBLEMS</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>QUESTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>blurry</b> <b>image</b> <b>and/or</b> <b>interference</b> <b>patterns</b>
       If  your  input  file  contains  -or  consists  of- pixel images (as opposed to just vector data which is
       essentially resolution independent), you might have this problem.  Such pixel images are normally made to
       fit well to standard 300 (or 600) dpi devices.  Scaling such a picture with an carelessly chosen  factor,
       can easily lead to hazy edges and interference patterns on the output.  The solution is to provide <u>poster</u>
       with  an  exact  scaling  factor  (with  the  -s  option),  chosen  as  an integer. If integer scaling is
       impractical for your purpose, choose a fractional number made from a small integer denominator (2, 3, 4).

   <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>select</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>input</b> <b>picture?</b>
       Yes, for this purpose you can define both the size (width and height) and offset (from left  and  bottom)
       of a window on the input image.  Specify these numbers as argument to a `-i' command line option.
       One  way  to  obtain  such  numbers  is  previewing  the original image with ghostview, and observing the
       coordinate numbers which it continually displays.  These numbers are in postscript units (points),  named
       by <u>poster</u> as just `p'.

   <b>Poster</b> <b>doesn't</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>properly,</b> <b>output</b> <b>pages</b> <b>are</b> <b>empty</b>
       The  major  cause  for poster not to work correctly, is giving it postscript files which don't conform to
       proper 'eps'  behaviour.   Try  whether  your  application  (or  printer  driver)  cannot  generate  real
       'encapsulated postscript'.

   <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>50x50cm</b> <b>poster,</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>generates</b> <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b>
       Yes,  probably.  When  specifying  a desired output size with the `-p' option, <u>poster</u> first determines an
       array of sheets to cover such an area.  Then it determines a scale factor for the picture to  fill  these
       sheets  upto their edge. As result your requested size is used as rough guess only.  If you want an exact
       output size, specify the scaling factor yourself with the `-s' option (and omit the `-p').

   <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>space</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>original</b>
       <u>Poster</u> will as default use the input image bounding box, and scale/translate that to the  edges  of  your
       poster.   If  the program which generated your input file specifies an exact and tight %%BoundingBox, you
       will indeed loose your white margin.  To keep the original margin, specify a `-i' option with as argument
       the papersize on which the original document was formatted (such as  `-iA4').   Alternatively  specify  a
       smaller scale factor (with -s) or an explicit new margin (with -w).

</pre><h4><b>POSTER</b> <b>ASSEMBLY</b></h4><pre>
       Our preferred method for the assembly of a poster from multiple sheets is as follows:

       - Arrange the sheets in the proper order on a large table or on the floor.

       - Remove  from  all sheets, except from those in the leftmost column or bottom row, their left and bottom
         cutmargin.

       - In left-to-right and bottom-to-top order, glue the right (and top) cutmargin and stick the  right  (and
         upper) neighbouring page on top of that.

       - Turn  the  glued-together poster face bottom, and put adhesive tape on the sheet edges (on the backside
         of the poster) for more strength.

       - Remove the remaining cutmargin around the poster.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       For postscript level-2 capable printers/plotters, which is about all  modern  postscript  devices  today,
       <u>poster</u> will send device settings in its output file.  This consists of a `setpagedevice' call, setting:

       - the media size.
         This is required for all printers I know to get correct behaviour on different media/picture sizes.

       - duplexing off.
         Some  printers  will  otherwise  perform double-side printing by default.  Clearly that is not what you
         want to print a poster.

       - manual media feed.
         This is given only when <u>poster</u> was executed with the `-f' command line option.  This  is  a  convenient
         feature if you want to print your job on different media than normally installed in the paper tray, and
         you are submitting your job through a multi-user networking and spooling environment.

       These  settings  cause  proper  device  behaviour, without the need to manually interact with the printer
       settings, and has been here locally tested to work on devices like the HP300XL and HP650C.

       The settings thus passed in the postscript file, will affect the device for this job only.

</pre><h4><b>DSC</b> <b>CONFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Poster</u> will generate its own DSC header and other DSC lines in the output file, according  the  `Document
       Structuring Conventions - version 3.0', as written down in the `Postscript Language Reference Manual, 2nd
       ed.' from Adobe Systems Inc, Addison Wesley Publ comp., 1990.

       It  will  copy  any `%%Document...' line from the input file DSC header to its own header output. This is
       used here in particular for required nonresident fonts.

       However the copy(s) of the input file included in the output, are stripped from all lines starting with a
       `%%', since they tend to disturb our `ghostview' previewer and take useless space anyhow.
