       scanssh — scans the Internet for open proxies and SSH servers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scanssh</b> [<b>-VIERph</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>scanners,...</u>] [<b>-n</b> <u>ports,...</u>] [<b>-u</b> <u>socks</u> <u>hosts,...</u>] [<b>-e</b> <u>excludefile</u>] <u>addresses...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ScanSSH</b>  scans  the given addresses and networks for running services.  It mainly allows the detection of
       open proxies and Internet services.  For known services, <b>ScanSSH</b> will  query  their  version  number  and
       displays the results in a list.

       The  adresses can be either specified as an IPv4 address or an CIDR like IP prefix, <u>ipaddress/masklength</u>.
       Ports can be appended by adding a colon at the end of address specification.

       Additionally, the following two commands can be prefixed to the address:

       random(n[,seed])/  The random command selects random address  from  the  address  range  specified.   The
                          arguments  are  as follows: <u>n</u> is the number of address to randomly create in the given
                          network and <u>seed</u> is a seed for the pseudo random number generator.

       split(s,e)/        The split command is used to split the address range  in  several  unique  components.
                          This  can  be  use  to  scan  from  serveral  hosts in parallel.  The arguments are as
                          follows: <u>e</u> specifies the number of hosts scanning in parallel and <u>s</u> is the  number  of
                          the host this particular scan runs on.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-V</b>              Causes <b>scanssh</b> to print its version number.

       <b>-I</b>              Does not send a SSH identification string.

       <b>-E</b>              Exit the program, if the file containing the addresses for exclusion can not be found.

       <b>-R</b>              If  addresses  are  generated  at random, this flag causes the program to ignore excluded
                       addresses from the exclude file.  The default behaviour is to always exclude addresses.

       <b>-p</b>              Specifies that <b>ScanSSH</b> should operate as a proxy detector.  This flag  sets  the  default
                       modes and default scanners to detect open proxies.

       <b>-h</b>              Displays the usage of the program.

       <b>-n</b> <u>ports,...</u>    Specifies  the  port  numbers  to  scan.   Ports are separated by commas.  Each specified
                       scanner is run for each port in this list.  The default is 22.

       <b>-u</b> <u>socks</u> <u>hosts,...</u>
                       A list of comma separated host:port pairs of SOCKS proxies that  <b>scanssh</b>  should  use  to
                       scan through.

       <b>-s</b> <u>scanners</u>     Specifies  a number of scanners should be executed for each open port.  Multiple scanners
                       are separated by commas.  The following scanners are currently supported:

                       ssh            Finds versions for SSH, Web and SMTP servers.

                       socks5         Detects if a SOCKS V5 proxy is running on the port.

                       socks4         Detects if a SOCKS V4 proxy is running on the port.

                       http-proxy     Detects a HTTP get proxy.

                       http-connect   Detects a HTTP connect proxy.

                       telnet-proxy   Detects telnet based proxy servers.

       <b>-e</b> <u>excludefile</u>  Specifies the file that contains the addresses to be excluded from the scan.  The  syntax
                       is the same as for the addresses on the command line.

       The  output from <b>scanssh</b> contains only IP addresses.  However, the IP addresses can be converted to names
       with the <u><a href="../man8/logresolve.8.html">logresolve</a></u>(8) tool included in the Apache webserver.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following command scans the class C network 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.255 for open proxies:

       scanssh -p 10.0.0.0/24

       The next command scans for ssh servers on port 22 only:

       scanssh -n 22 -s ssh 192.168.0.0/16

       The following command can be used in a parallel scan.  Two hosts scan the  specified  networks  randomly,
       where this is the first host:

       scanssh 'random(0,rsd)/split(1,2)/(192.168.0.0/16 10.1.0.0/24):22,80'

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       At  the  moment,  <b>scanssh</b>  leaves a one line entry in the log file of the ssh server.  It is probably not
       possible to avoid that.
