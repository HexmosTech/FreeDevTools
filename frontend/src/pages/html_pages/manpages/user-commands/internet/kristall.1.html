</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kristall</b> - a cross-platform graphical small-internet client.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kristall</b> [<u>FLAGS</u>]... [<u>URL</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kristall</b>  is  a  small-Internet  browser  primarily  designed for browsing geminispace, but also supports
       gopher, finger, and basic HTTP/S.  It tries to fill the hole of graphical browsers for these  alternative
       Internet  protocols,  with  a  high  usability,  feature  richness,  and  somewhat familiar interface for
       newcomers.

</pre><h4><b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Displays help information

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Displays version information

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--new-window</b>
              Opens <u>URL</u> in a new window if another Kristall session is already running (instead of opening a new
              tab).

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--isolated</b>
              Starts the instance of Kristall as an isolated session that cannot communicate with other Kristall
              windows.

       The main interface of Kristall consists of three parts:

       * the navigation bar on top,

       * the content view in the center

       * and the status bar on the bottom

       ### Navigation bar

       In the navigation bar, you have some buttons and your URL bar.

       You can enter any supported URL in the URL bar, press <u>Return</u> and Kristall will then load the page in  the
       content view. You usually need to specify the url scheme to navigate to a specific site, but you can omit
       the  gemini://  prefix  for gemini pages. If you enter a URL with no scheme, and it looks like a URL (e.g
       "tilde.pink"), Kristall will assume that it is in fact a gemini URL. If you enter something  in  the  URL
       bar  that  <u>doesn't</u>  look  like  a URL (e.g "i like dogs"), it will be assumed a search query, and will be
       forwarded to the search engine that is set in the Settings.

       The two buttons on the left of the navigation bar that give you the ability to navigate back and forth in
       your browsing history. The button with the round arrow is the refresh button and allows you to reload the
       currently displayed site. While a site is loading, it is replaced with the stop button (square icon) that
       allows you to cancel the current request. Tip: Some  additional  buttons  can  also  be  enabled  in  the
       settings, to quickly navigate to the home page, and even the 'root' and 'parent' of the current URL! (See
       <b>Additional</b> <b>Toolbar</b> <b>Items</b> in Settings)

       On the right side of the URL bar you will find two buttons:

       * The button with the small heart icon in it will add or remove this page to your favourites, this can be
       done  as  well  by pressing <u>Ctrl-D</u>. When the heart on the button is filled, the site is contained in your
       favourites. If not, the heart has only a outline display. Clicking this button will open a small menu  to
       allow  you  to  quickly place the favourite in a folder of your choosing (by default 'Unsorted'). You can
       press <u>Return</u> in this menu to quickly affirm the options displayed in it.

       * The button with the shield icon toggles the use of client certificates.  Pressing  it  when  no  client
       certificate  is  enabled,  a  dialog  will  pop  up  asking you to select or create a certificate. When a
       certificate is enabled, the button will have a filled shield with a small lock in it. Pressing the button
       now will disable the currently used certificate. Note that  if  you're  using  a  transient  certificate,
       Kristall will ask you a safety question before destroying the certificate.

       ### Content view

       The  content  view  renders the requested document. For hypertext documents (i.e gemtext, markdown, etc),
       you get a nicely rendered version of those documents, other text files are displayed in monospace.  Audio
       and  video  files  are  played  in a small built-in media player that allows you to play/pause the media,
       scroll around in the time line and mute/unmute audio. Images are rendered in an  interactive  view  where
       you can drag the image around and zoom in/out with the mouse wheel.

       Documents  that can't be rendered will be displayed with file size and mime type, so you can save them to
       disk and open the files with another program.

       Right-clicking in the content view  will  produce  a  menu  which  allows  you  to  copy  text,  navigate
       back/forward in history, and copy or open links which are being hovered over. If you right click a HTTP/S
       link you will also see an option "Open with external web browser" which allows you to open these pages in
       your default WWW browser.

       ### Status bar

       The status bar displays auxiliary information:

       On  the  left,  you can see the link target when you hover a link. On the right, you can see the document
       size, time needed to load the document and the mime type of the content.  This  is  especially  important
       when  Kristall  is not able to render the document nicely. A "(cached)" indicator will appear to the left
       of the mime type, indicating that the page has been read from cache.

       ## Menus

       This chapter explains what each menu button does. I hope that most stuff isn't surprising 😉

       ### File

       <b>New</b> <b>Tab</b> will open a new tab to surf.

       <b>New</b> <b>Window</b> will open a new window to browse in.

       <b>Save</b> <b>as</b> allows you to save the currently displayed file to your disk.

       <b>Close</b> <b>Tab</b> will close the current tab. Does the same as clicking the small (×) button on the tab itself.

       <b>Manage</b> <b>Certificates</b> will bring  up  a  dialog  that  allows  you  to  create,  delete  or  change  client
       certificates.

       <b>Settings</b> will open a dialog that helps you configure Kristall to your likings.

       <b>Quit</b> will close Kristall.

       ### Navigation

       This menu contains means to navigate the internet.

       <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> <b>home</b> will navigate your current tab to your home page.

       <b>Backward</b> will navigate one page back in your history.

       <b>Foreward</b> will navigate one page foreward in your history.

       <b>Root</b>  will  take  you  to  the  root  directory  of  the  current  site.  e.g  if  you  are  currently at
       gemini://example.com/gemlog/some-document.gmi, you will be taken to gemini://example.com/

       <b>Parent</b>  will  take  you  to  the  'parent'  directory  of  the  current  site.  e.g   if   you   are   at
       gemini://example.com/parent/some-document.gmi, you will be taken to gemini://example.com/parent/

       <b>Refresh</b> will reload the current page. This may be necessary for CGI scripts or other interactive content.

       <b>Add</b> <b>to</b> <b>favourites</b> will add or remove the current page to/from your list of favourites.

       ### View

       This menu allows you to show/hide dockable dialogs.

       <b>Document</b>  <b>Outline</b>  toggles  the  document  outline.  Documents  with text/gemini get an automatic outline
       generation that can be used to navigate larger documents quicker. If you're reading  this  help  document
       inside of Kristall, this is a good place to try this feature out!

       <b>Favourites</b>  opens  a  dock  containing  a  list of all your favourite (a.k.a bookmarked) sites. Open your
       favourites into a new tab by double-clicking or pressing <u>Return</u> on the entries. If you right click on  an
       entry  you  will  be  presented  with  a menu in which you can edit the name or location of the entry, or
       delete it. Right-clicking in the window (not on an entry, not on a group) will allow you to create a  new
       "group"  of  entries. Right clicking on a group will allow you to rename the group, or recursively delete
       it (be careful!).

       <b>History</b> shows the surfing history of the current tab. Double-clicking an entry navigates back  and  forth
       in your history without disturbing the list.

       ### Help

       This menu contains some stuff that provides help or information about Kristall.

       <b>Help</b> displays the help manual (this document).

       <b>Changelog</b> will open a document that lists the changes in Kristall in a bulleted list.

       <b>About</b> shows a dialog with some information about Kristall.

       <b>About</b> <b>Qt</b> shows a dialog containing legal information about the Qt version used.

       ## Settings

       Kristall offers a vast amount of settings. You can style the documents to your liking, changing fonts and
       colors.  You  can  also  fine-tune the behaviour of Kristall to match your likings and keep track of your
       trusted pages. Please note that Kristall has been designed mostly for browsing geminispace, thus many  of
       these settings are specific or exclusive to Gemini only.

       ### Generic

       This tab contains an unsorted list of settings that allow you to tweak Kristalls behaviour.

       <b>Start</b>  <b>Page</b>  is  the  URL  to  the  page  that  will  be  loaded  for  new  tabs  and windows. Default is
       <b>about:favourites</b>.

       <b>Search</b> <b>Engine</b> is the search engine to use when typing non-URLs in the URL bar. A handful of Gemini search
       engines are provided as a drop-down. If you would like to specify  your  own,  specify  it  in  a  format
       similar to the following:

              gemini://example.com/search?%1

       Note the "%1" at the end of the URL. This is where search queries will be inserted. This <u>must</u> be provided
       in  order  for  Kristall  to  work with the search engine correctly. Be aware that search engine URLs can
       vary. For example, a different search engine may appear like so:

              gemini://example2.com/search/another/%1

       <b>Additional</b> <b>Toolbar</b> <b>Items</b> contains various additional toolbar items which some may find useful.

       * <b>Home</b> button opens the configured home page in the current tab.

       * <b>New</b> <b>tab</b> button appears to the right of the tab bar. This simply adds a new tab to the current window.

       * <b>Root</b> button takes you to the root directory of the current  site.  (See  Menus&gt;Navigation  section  for
       explanation of what this does).

       *  <b>Parent</b> button takes you to the parent directory of the current site. (See Menus&gt;Navigation section for
       explanation of what this does).

       <b>UI</b> <b>Theme</b> controls whether the Qt interface is displayed in a dark or a light theme.  Selecting  <b>Light</b>  or
       <b>Dark</b> will use the provided Qt light/dark themes. <b>OS</b> <b>Default</b> will use your system theme.

       <b>Icon</b>  <b>Theme</b>  controls  the  specific  icon  set that the Qt interface will use. Usually, the default <b>Auto</b>
       option should be good enough, however for those using the <b>OS</b> <b>Default</b> UI theme, this option may be useful.

       <b>UI</b> <b>Density</b> controls the margin of the toolbar buttons.

       * <b>Compact</b> has a very low margin

       * <b>Classic</b> has the original big margin

       <b>Enabled</b> <b>Protocols</b> allows you to fine-tune which protocols are  fetched  by  Kristall.  By  default,  only
       Gemini  is  enabled,  all  other  protocols  are  disabled. Disabled protocols are either not served, and
       produce an error message, or are forwarded to your OS handler for that URL scheme.

       <b>Unknown</b> <b>Scheme</b> changes the behaviour how Kristall handles unknown/disabled URL schemes.  <b>Use</b>  <b>OS</b>  <b>default</b>
       <b>handler</b>  will  invoke  your OS default, <b>Display</b> <b>error</b> <b>message</b> will just pop up a message box and tell you
       that Kristall cannot handle this URL.

       <b>Max.</b> <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> <b>Redirections</b> is a setting that allows you to restrict sites to redirect you only a certain
       number of times before erroring out. Setting this to 0 will disable redirections  completely,  displaying
       an error with the target URL.

       <b>Redirection</b>  <b>Handling</b>  allows  you to fine-tune the way Kristall allows redirections. Each of the options
       defines if Kristall should ask you to allow  the  redirect  or  do  it  silently.  <b>Ask</b>  <b>for</b>  <b>cross-scheme</b>
       <b>redirection</b>  will  pop  up  a message box if a host tries to redirect you from one URL scheme to another,
       e.g. when a web server redirects you from HTTP to HTTPS. <b>Ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>cross-host</b> <b>redirection</b> will pop  up  the
       message  box  for  all  redirections  through  host  boundaries,  e.g.  when example.com redirects you to
       www.example.com. <b>Ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>cross-scheme</b>  <b>or</b>  <b>cross-host</b>  <b>redirection</b>  will  enable  both  of  the  previous
       behaviours,  asking  when  any cross-boundary redirection happens. <b>Ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>redirections</b> will pop up a
       message box every time a server tries to redirect you, keeping you in full control over all redirections.
       <b>Silently</b> <b>redirect</b> <b>everything</b> is the exact oppositve of that, accepting all redirections  without  warning
       or notice.

       <b>Network</b>  <b>Timeout</b>  is the time a server is allowed to <u>not</u> <u>respond</u> <u>anything</u> before a error message appears.
       As long as a server dripples some bytes to Kristall, no timeout will happen, so  having  a  slow  or  bad
       connection shouldn't yield timeouts.

       ### Display

       This  tabs  contains  tweaks  you can apply to the display behaviour. Change text effects or rendering of
       documents.

       <b>Render</b> <b>emojis</b> allows you to toggle whether to render emojis using installed emoji fonts.  Disabling  this
       can  help  prevent  text  rendering issues due to emojis. Note that emojis are only supported in Kristall
       builds with Qt 5.13 or later.

       <b>URL</b> <b>bar</b> <b>highlights</b> sets whether the URL bar should use "fancy" highlights. The highlighting simply  makes
       the  domain  of the site more prominent/visible, and the text around it slightly dimmed. This is purely a
       cosmetic feature.

       <b>Text</b> <b>Rendering</b> allows one to control whether Kristall parses text input files or not. This is usually set
       to <b>Fancy</b> which renders text/html, text/gemini, text/markdown and text/gophermap to  a  nice,  hyperlinked
       display.  When  set  to  <b>Always</b>  <b>plain</b>  <b>text</b>,  Kristall  will display all text/* files as plaintext files
       instead. This may be inconvenient, but necessary for misparsed sites.

       <b>Use</b> <b>typographer's</b> <b>quotes</b> sets whether to replace regular quotation marks, that is:

              "these", and 'these'

       with fancy Unicode quotes, which include the following:

              “these”, and ‘these’

       This is a purely cosmetic feature that may aid in readability.

       <b>ANSI</b> <b>Escape</b> <b>Sequences</b> determines the method of handling ANSI escape codes.  This  allows  a  document  to
       alter some of the format (colour, etc) of text.

       *  <b>Ignore</b>  ignores ANSI sequences and leaves them in the text. This option will often create eyesores out
       of pages that have fancy ANSI art!

       * <b>Interpret</b> <b>(preformatted</b>  <b>text</b>  <b>only)</b>  will  allow  Kristall  to  interpret  ANSI  escape  sequences  in
       <u>preformatted</u> text blocks.

       * <b>Strip</b> is a hybrid of the above. It strips ANSI sequences from the text, and displays the text normally,
       as if the escape sequences were not there.

       <b>Enable</b>  <b>text</b>  <b>highlights</b>  allows  you to enable <u>bolding</u> and <u>underlining</u> in text/gemini documents. Bolding
       **like this** also works.

       <b>Gopher</b> <b>Map</b> allows you to chose a modern iconized style for gopher maps or, if you are  an  old  schooler,
       just use a textual description of the item types in the map.

       <b>Hidden</b>  <b>files</b>  <b>in</b>  <b>file://</b>  <b>directories</b>  determines  whether hidden files will display in local directory
       listings (i.e file:// URLs which do not point to a specific document but rather a directory).

       <b>Strip</b> <b>&lt;nav&gt;</b> <b>from</b> <b>HTML</b> <b>pages</b> allows you to remove the &lt;nav&gt; tag from HTML pages. This might  make  certain
       pages more readable, others completely unusable.

       ### Cache

       Kristall  employs  a  small  cache  system  that makes forward/backward navigation much quicker. This tab
       provides controls to tweak the caching behaviour.

       <b>Total</b> <b>cache</b> <b>size</b> <b>limit</b> sets the total amount of memory that can be used by Kristall to  cache  pages.  By
       default  this is set to 500 KiB, but can be set to 0 to completely disable the caching system. The larger
       this number is, the more memory you are allowing Kristall to use.

       <b>Cached</b> <b>item</b> <b>size</b> <b>threshold</b> is the maximum size of a single cached item. By default this  is  set  to  400
       KiB. This prevents Kristall from caching any pages that are large from clogging up the in-memory cache.

       <b>Cached</b>  <b>item</b>  <b>life</b>  is the amount of time in minutes before a single cached item is considered "expired."
       When a cached item is "expired", it is not read from cache, but instead  re-retreived  from  the  server.
       Cache  life  can  be  disabled by enabling the <b>Unlimited</b> <b>item</b> <b>life</b> option. Note: <b>Cached</b> <b>item</b> <b>life</b> is only
       recommended if you desperately want to keep your memory usage to a minimum, otherwise,  having  <b>Unlimited</b>
       <b>item</b> <b>life</b> is usually a great convenience, and due to the usually very small size of pages in geminispace,
       gopherspace, etc - it doesn't require much memory.

       ### Style

       In this tab, you can customise the document rendering in Kristall. The left pane contains a vast array of
       options to tweak, and the right pane displays a preview of your currently-selected style.

       Many  items  in  the <u>Style</u> category have either a <b>Font</b>, <b>Color</b>, or both buttons. Click these to change the
       respective value.

       <b>Background</b> <b>Color</b> is the color that fills the empty space in a document.

       <b>Standard</b> <b>Font</b> allows you to change the font that is used for all non-preformatted and  non-heading  text.
       Choose the color and font family/size/style.

       <b>Preformatted</b>  <b>Font</b>  is  the  font  and text color that is used for all &lt;pre&gt; tags in HTML or preformatted
       blocks in text/gemini. This should be a monospace font, otherwise ASCII art will break horribly. Note  to
       MacOS X users: "Andale Mono" is a good font choice here.

       <b>H1</b> <b>Font</b> allows you to change the font and color for primary headings in documents.

       <b>H2</b> <b>Font</b> allows you to change the font and color for secondary headings in documents.

       <b>H3</b> <b>Font</b> allows you to change the font and color for ternary headings in documents.

       <b>Blockquote</b> <b>Font</b> allows you to change the font and colour for blockquotes in documents.

       <b>Local</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Color</b> is the color in which links that refer to the same host <u>and</u> protocol are rendered.

       <b>Foreign</b>  <b>Link</b>  <b>Color</b>  is  the  color in which links that refer to another host, but the same protocol are
       rendered. This helps to recognize when you change the content provider with a link.

       <b>Cross-Scheme-Color</b> is used for all links that change protocol. For example: If you are currently visiting
       a gemini-served page and are referred to a page in gopher space, this color will be used. This gives  you
       more control over your surfing experience.

       <b>Local</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Prefix</b> is a small string that is placed before a link to the same host.

       <b>Extern</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Prefix</b> is a small string that is placed before a link to a different host.

       <b>Block</b> <b>Quote</b> <b>Color</b> is the background color that allows you to highlight block quotes.

       <b>Auto-Theme</b> <b>Generation</b> is an experimental feature that can be set to <b>Disabled</b>, <b>Light</b> <b>Theme</b> and <b>Dark</b> <b>Theme</b>.
       When  not  set  to <b>Disabled</b>, Kristall will ignore all your beautiful color settings and tries to create a
       color scheme based on the current pages host name. This allows different styles for each host visited and
       brings some recognizability in gemini and gopher space.

       <b>Left/right</b> <b>Page</b> <b>Margin</b> is the distance of horizontal page content to the left/right borders. If you  have
       <b>Enable</b> <b>text</b> <b>width</b> <b>limit</b> enabled this value is only used when the window size is less than the set maximum
       text width.

       <b>Top/bottom</b> <b>Page</b> <b>Margin</b> is the distance of vertical page content to the top/bottom borders.

       <b>Other</b>  <b>options</b>  are  a  set  of  extra  options to enhance your reading experience (and just look cool in
       general).

       * <b>Justify</b> <b>text</b> will make text fill the lines they are on. Note that this only works on gemtext pages.

       * <b>Centre</b> <b>first</b> <b>H1</b> will centre-align the first top-level heading in gemtext pages. This  can  look  really
       cool with <b>Text</b> <b>width</b> <b>limit</b> enabled!

       <b>Text</b>  <b>width</b>  <b>limit</b>  sets  the maximum line length of text. By default this is set to 900px. If the window
       itself is smaller in width than the text width limit, the text width limit is "adjusted"  to  fit  inside
       the window. As mentioned above, horizontal margins will also be applied here. The <b>Enabled</b> checkbox to the
       right of this option toggles whether this option is enabled or not. (Enabled by default)

       <b>Line</b>  <b>height</b> <b>(paragraph)</b> is an additional spacing between paragraph text lines. By default this is set to
       5px, and can help with readability. (Gemtext-only feature)

       <b>Line</b> <b>height</b> <b>(header)</b> is an additional spacing between header text lines. By default this is set  to  5px.
       (Gemtext-only feature)

       <b>Indentation</b> is a set of options that control the level of indent in certain text parts in Gemini pages.

       * <b>Par</b> controls indent size of paragraphs (default: 1)

       * <b>Hea</b> controls indent size of headings (default: 0)

       * <b>Quo</b> controls indent size of blockquotes (default: 1)

       * <b>Lst</b> controls indent size of unordered lists (default: 2)

       <b>Indent</b>  <b>Size</b>  is  the  size  in  pixels  of a single indent. This affects how much of an effect the above
       <b>Indentation</b> settings have on the layout (default 15).

       <b>List</b> <b>item</b> <b>marker</b> simply lets you set what symbol is used in list items. By default this is set to  Filled
       Circle.

       <b>Presets</b>  is  a cool feature to save, restore and share your color themes. The dropdown contains a list of
       all previously created colors schemes. With the <b>+</b> button you can create a scheme with a unique name.  The
       floppy disk button will override the currently selected preset with all the settings displayed above. The
       folder  button  will  restore  a previously saved preset. The last two buttons allow you to import/export
       presets to disk and share them with your friends! Share all your beautiful color schemes with the world!

       The lone text with with the <b>host.name</b> text in it can be used to preview some  auto-generated  themes.  It
       only refreshes the preview and seeds the auto generator with a new host name.

       ### Gemini TLS and HTTPS TLS

       These  two  sites  contain the TLS settings for either Gemini or HTTPS. Both protocols are handled in the
       same way, but with different data sets, so each one has its own settings page.

       <b>Trust</b> <b>Level</b> defines how you trust hosts. <b>Trust</b> <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>encounter</b> is also known as <u>Trust</u> <u>On</u> <u>First</u> <u>Use</u> (or
       TOFU) and will store the servers public key in Kristalls database of trusted hosts. If a  host  is  later
       encountered that has changed its public key, an error will be displayed to the user that this host may be
       compromised  (as  the  changing of a public key can be a man-in-the-middle attack). <b>Trust</b> <b>everything</b> will
       just happily accept every TLS  server,  ignoring  the  certificate  issuer  completely.  <b>Manually</b>  <b>verify</b>
       <b>fingerprints</b> allows you to chose whether you trust a server or not based on its fingerprint. This will be
       displayed in the error page as well as the option to add that server to your list of trusted hosts.

       <b>Certificate</b>  <b>Authorities</b>  allows you to enable/disable the use of your systems CA trust store. Sites that
       can be enabled via the CA system will not be added to the list of trusted hosts (as it is only meant  for
       TOFU/manual  implementation),  but will not error out. <b>Use</b> <b>local</b> <b>certificate</b> <b>authorities</b> will enable that
       behaviour, <b>Don't</b> <b>use</b> <b>local</b> <b>certificate</b> <b>authorities</b> will disable it.

       <b>Trusted</b> <b>Hosts</b> displays your database of currently trusted hosts for either Gemini or HTTPS  servers.  You
       can  see  the  host name (which is used for identification), the date when you trusted the server and the
       type of the key that server is using.

       <b>Revoke</b> <b>trust</b> allows you to remove a server from your database. Select a server in the list and click  the
       button. Kristall will now act as it hasn't ever seen that server before and will now handle the server as
       an unknown one.

       ## Certificate Manager

       This  dialog  allows  you to manage your client certificates. There are options to import, export, delete
       and create new certificates as well as manage your existing ones.

       The window is separated in two halves:

       The left half is the overview over your certificates and your available actions.

       The right half contains information about the currently selected certificate.

       The overview displays your certificates managed in groups. Each certificate is contained in a group  that
       allows  you  to  structure  your  certificates better. Good groups for example is <u>Accounts</u>, <u>Access</u> <u>Token</u>,
       <u>Games</u>, ... You can move certificates between different  groups  by  using  drag'n'drop.  Just  click  the
       certificate and drag it over into another group.

       When selecting a certificate, its details are displayed on the right side of the screen:

       <b>Display</b>  <b>Name</b>  is  the  text you will see in the overview on the left and on the smaller dialog selection
       screen. You can type in here whatever you want, it's just for you. It's possible to edit this value.

       <b>Common</b> <b>Name</b> is the CN value that was used when creating the certificate. Its used as a identifier and the
       only required field when creating the cert. You cannot change this.

       <b>Expiration</b> <b>Date</b> is the date when your certificate expires.

       <b>Expires</b> <b>in</b> shows the numbe of days until your certificate expires. This may be  more  intuitive  to  work
       with, but communicating the expiration date is recommended.

       <b>Host</b>  <b>Filter</b> is a security-measurement to shield you from accidental identity exposure. You can type in a
       URL with wildcards, using ? for a single character, * for any number of characters, including zero and  <b>…</b>
       for  allowing a set of certain characters to be matched. When you try activating the certificate on a URL
       that does not match your Host Filter, Kristall will ask you if you really want to enable the certificate.
       This prevents you from accidentally using the certificate on a host or URL where it shouldn't be used.

       <b>Auto-Enable</b> <b>Certificate</b> is built on top of the Host Filter. When you  don't  have  a  client  certificate
       enabled  <u>and</u>  you visit a URL that matches the Host Filter property, Kristall will ask you if you want to
       enable that certificate. This is convenient when you need a certificate to visit  that  location  anyways
       and this allows you to quickly enable your default certificate.

       <b>Fingerprint</b> is the SHA256 fingerprint of this certificate.

       <b>Notes</b>  is a free-form text field for your private use. Kristall does not use this value what-so-ever. Use
       this field to make notes about that certificate.

       You can find more information about the wildcard syntax here:

               Wildcard Matching: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qregexp.html#qregexp-wildcard-matching

       Below the certificate overview are four buttons, described from left to the right:

       <b>Create</b> <b>certificate</b> will open up  the  certificate  creation  dialog  and  allows  you  to  create  a  new
       certificate.

       <b>Import</b>  <b>certificate</b>  will  open  up  the  certificate  i/o  dialog.  This allows you to import a existing
       certificate/key pair, supporting RSA and EC cryptography as well as PEM/DER encoded files.

       <b>Export</b> <b>certificate</b> will open up the certificate i/o dialog. This  allows  you  to  export  the  currently
       selected  certificate  into  a  certificate/key  pair.  This  allows PEM/DER encoded files and you should
       remember/note what kind of format your key has. Exporting allows you to  back  up  you  keys,  change  to
       another browser or share them with your friends (don't!).

       <b>Delete</b>  <b>certificate</b> will delete the currently selected certificate or group. You will get a security pop-
       up when deleting a certificate as this is  a  non-reversable  operation  (unless  you  made  a  back-up).
       Deleting empty groups is always allowed without pop-up, deleting non-empty groups is not allowed.

       Using passphrases for importing/exporting certificates is currently not supported.

       Please  note  that  changes  in  this dialog are immediaty applied and there is no way back when doing an
       action. This may change in the future, but will stay like this for now.

       ## Certificate Selection Dialog

       This dialog allows you to enable client certificates. It is opened by clicking the shield button  in  the
       navigation bar or it will automatically pop up when a site requests the use of a client certificate.

       In  the upper part, this dialog provides you with a list of all your persistent certificates. If you want
       to use one of those, select the certificate and click <b>Use</b>. Or simply double-click a certificate to  chose
       it.

       You can also ad-hoc create a new certificate with the click on <b>Create</b> <b>new</b> <b>identity</b>. This will open up the
       certificate creation dialog which allows you to create new identities.

       On  the lower part you can create temporary certificates that have a short lifespan and will be destroyed
       as soon as you disable the certificate or close your client.

       ## Certificate Creation Dialog

       This dialog provides means to create a new persistent identity.

       <b>Group</b> is the name of the group where this certificate should be stored. You can either chose an  existing
       group from the drop down or just enter a non-existing name to create a new group ad-hoc.

       <b>Display</b> <b>Name</b> is the title of the certificate that Kristall will show you. It will not be sent to a server
       ever.

       <b>Common</b> <b>Name</b> is the CN field in the X509 certificate. It's required for identitication to the hosts.

       <b>Expiration</b>  <b>Date</b>  is the date when your certificate becomes invalid. Kristall choses a default of "1 year
       from now on", but you can chose any time you want, even just 30 minutes. Better chose a long time  though
       if you don't know how long you need that certificate.

       With  a  click on <b>OK</b>, Kristall will create a new certificate and put it in your certificate store. It can
       then be selected from the certificate selection dialog or certificate manager.

       ## Certificate I/O Dialog

       This dialog enables you to import or export certificate-key-pairs into or from Kristall.

       <b>Key</b> <b>Type</b> contains the type of your key. If you import, you need to select the correct key type there,  if
       you export, it will be disabled, but shows the correct type of key for your identity.

       <b>Key</b>  <b>File</b>  needs  to  be a full path to either a .der or .pem file where Kristall will load/store the key
       from/to.

       <b>Certificate</b> <b>File</b> needs to be a full path to either a .der or .pem file where Kristall will load/store the
       certificate from/to.

       ## Shortcuts

       The following list contains all of Kristall's built-in shortcuts:

       ## Protocol support

       These protocols are currently supported via their respective URL schemes:

               Gemini: https://gemini.circumlunar.space/

               HTTP/HTTPS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol

               Gopher: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)

               Finger: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_protocol

       ### Gemini

       Kristall tries to implement the current feature set of the gemini specification. All response types of  a
       gemini server are relayed to the user and the user choses when to do certain actions or not. Redirections
       are followed automatically, and you will be prompted depending on your configured Settings.

       ### Gopher

       Kristall provides access to gopherspace and supports most modern/common file types:

       * Gophermaps / Directories

       * Text

       * Sound / Audio / Music

       * Images / GIFs

       * HTML

       * Mirrors

       There is currently no support for automatic redirection on URL: resources or special/oldschool file types
       like DOS/HexBin/UUencoded data.

       ### Local file browsing

       The  file://  scheme  can be used to browse local files and directories on your system. (This feature has
       not been well-tested on Windows systems)

       Browsing to a local directory, such as file:///home/user will create a "directory  listing",  with  links
       allowing you to navigate the file structure.

       Browsing  to an actual file, such as file:///home/user/file.txt will cause Kristall to attempt to display
       that file.

       ### Built-in sites

       There is also the scheme about: which can be used to access internal sites for  configuration,  usability
       or help (this is one of them!):

              about:blank

              about:favourites

              about:help

              about:updates

              about:style-preview

              about:style-display

              about:cache

       ## Security Concept

       Kristall has some built-in security measures to make your browsing experience safe and sane.

       ### Philosophy

       Kristall will always try to warn or ask you if anything critical will happen.

       Sneakily redirecting you to another host?

       You missed disabling your client certficiate when switching hosts?

       Kristall  will  ask  you  whether  you  want to keep your current settings and continue or if you want to
       disable that feature. These security measures are quite non-intrusive  and  help  you  "not  missing  the
       click".

       It  will  also  make  some  artificial  hurdles when you can <u>really</u> make something that is critical, like
       visiting a host with a mistrusted certificate or deleting your client certificates.

       ### Security Measures

       * Client certificates will be disabled when doing a host or protocol switch

       * Client certificates allow host filtering to double-opt-in for non-planned hosts

       * Redirects check for cross-scheme or cross-host redirections.

       * Fine-grained customizations

       * Trusting TLS connections based on manually built lists, TOFU method or using the certificate  authority
       system

       ## Caching

       Kristall  has an in-memory page caching system enabled by default. This allows for quick loading of pages
       that have already been visited. Currently, this cache is cleared when Kristall is exited.

       The caching system is fairly basic; when a page is loaded, it is pushed to the cache (if  it  is  smaller
       than <b>Cached</b> <b>item</b> <b>size</b> <b>threshold</b>). If the cache exceeds the <b>Total</b> <b>cache</b> <b>size</b> <b>limit</b>, the oldest item in the
       cache is removed. The <b>Cached</b> <b>item</b> <b>life</b> determines how long this cached pages will be valid for.

       When a page is read from cache, it is indicated in the Status Bar, to the left of the mime type.

       If  you  would  like  to disable page caching, set the <b>Total</b> <b>cache</b> <b>size</b> <b>limit</b> to 0. See <u>Settings</u> for more
       information
