</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "biber" - A bibtex replacement for users of biblatex

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         biber [options] file[.bcf]
         biber [options] --tool &lt;datasource&gt;

         Creates "file.bbl" using control file "file.bcf" (".bcf" extension is
         optional). Normally use with biblatex requires no options as they are
         all set in biblatex and passed via the ".bcf" file

         In "tool" mode (see B&lt;--tool&gt; option), takes a datasource (defaults to
         "bibtex" datasource) and outputs a copy of the datasource with any command-line
         or config file options applied.

         Please run "biber --help" for option details

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "biber" provides a replacement of the bibtex processor for users of biblatex.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--annotation-marker=[marker]</b>
           Sets  the  suffix which can be appended to a BibTeX data source field name to indicate that the value
           of the field is a data annotation. The default is "+an".

       <b>--cache</b>
           If running as a PAR::Packer binary, show the cache location and exit.

       <b>--clrmacros</b>
           Clears any BibTeX macros (@STRING) between BibLaTeX refsections. This prevents BibTeX warnings  about
           macro redefinitions if you are using the same datasource several times for different refsections.

       <b>--collate-options|-c</b> <b>[options]</b>
           Options to pass to the "Unicode::Collate" object used for sorting (default is 'level =&gt; "4", variable
           =&gt; "non-ignorable"').  See "perldoc Unicode::Collate" for details.

       <b>--configfile|-g</b> <b>[file]</b>
           Use <u>file</u> as the configuration file for "biber" instead of looking in the default locations which are,
           in order:

           * "biber.conf" or ".biber.conf" in the current directory

           * "$HOME/.biber.conf"

           * "$ENV{XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/biber/biber.conf"

           * "$HOME/.config/biber/biber.conf"

           * "$HOME/Library/biber/biber.conf" (Mac OSX only)

           * "$ENV{APPDATA}/biber.conf" (Windows only)

           * The output of "kpsewhich biber.conf" (if available on the system).

           In tool mode, (<b>--tool</b>) the <u>biber-tool.conf</u> installed with Biber is always used to set default options
           if  a user-defined config file is not specified. Use the <b>--tool-config</b> option to view the location of
           the default tool mode config file which may be useful as a source for writing your own.

       <b>--convert-control</b>
           Converts the <u>.bcf</u> control file into html using an XSLT transform. Can be useful for  debugging.  File
           is named by appending ".html" to <u>.bcf</u> file.

       <b>--decodecharsset=[recode</b> <b>set</b> <b>name]</b>
           The set of characters included in the conversion routine when decoding LaTeX macros into UTF-8 (which
           happens when <b>--bblencoding|-E</b> is set to UTF-8). Set to "full" to try harder with a much larger set or
           "base"  to  use  a  smaller basic set. Default is "base". You may want to try "full" if you have less
           common UTF-8 characters in your data source. The recode sets are defined in the reencoding data  file
           which can be customised.  See the <b>--recodedata</b> option and the PDF manual. The virtual set name "null"
           may be specified which effectively turns off macro decoding.

       <b>--debug|-D</b>
           Turn on debugging for "biber".

       <b>--dieondatamodel</b>
           Exit  immediately  with  error  if  using  "--validate-datamodel" and a datamodel validation error is
           found. Default is to warn and continue.

       <b>--dot-include=section,field,xdata,crossref,xref,related</b>
           Specifies the element to include in GraphViz DOT output format if the output format  is  'dot'.   You
           can  also  choose  to display crossref, xref, xdata and/or related entry connections.  The default if
           not specified is "--dot-include=section,xdata,crossref,xref".

       <b>--fixinits</b>
           Try to fix broken multiple initials when they have no space between them in BibTeX data sources. That
           is, "A.B. Clarke" becomes "A. B. Clarke" before name parsing.  This can slightly mess up things  like
           "{U.K. Government}" and other esoteric cases.

       <b>--help|-h</b>
           Show this help message.

       <b>--input-directory</b> <b>[directory]</b>
           <u>.bcf</u>  and  data  files will be looked for first in the <u>directory</u>. See the biber PDF documentation for
           the other possibilities and how this interacts with the "--output-directory" option.

       <b>--input-encoding|-e</b> <b>[encoding]</b>
           Specify the encoding of the data source file(s). Default is "UTF-8" Normally it's  not  necessary  to
           set  this  as  it's  passed  via  the  .bcf  file from biblatex's "bibencoding" option.  See "perldoc
           Encode::Supported" for a list of supported encodings.  The legacy option <b>--bibencoding</b>  is  supported
           as an alias.

       <b>--input-format=bibtex|biblatexml</b>
           Biber  input  format.  This option only means something in tool mode (see <b>tool</b> option) since normally
           the input format of a data source is specified in the <u>.bcf</u> file and therefore from the <b>\addbibresouce</b>
           macro in BibLaTeX.  The default value when in tool mode is 'bibtex'

       <b>--isbn10</b>
           Force all ISBNs to 10-digit versions on output. This will convert the  ISBN  internally  to  an  ISBN
           object which will not have hyphens on output. If you use this option and want an ISBN with hyphens in
           the correct place on output, use the <b>--isbn-normalise</b> option.

       <b>--isbn13</b>
           Force  all  ISBNs  to  13-digit  versions on output. This will convert the ISBN internally to an ISBN
           object which will not have hyphens on output. If you use this option and want an ISBN with hyphens in
           the correct place on output, use the <b>--isbn-normalise</b> option.

       <b>--isbn-normalise</b>
           Normalise ISBNs with hyphens in the correct places on output.

       <b>--logfile</b> <b>[file]</b>
           Use <u>file.blg</u> as the name of the logfile.

       <b>--listsep=[sep]</b>
           Use <u>sep</u> as the separator for BibTeX data source list fields. Defaults to BibTeX's usual 'and'.

       <b>--mincrossrefs|-m</b> <b>[number]</b>
           Set threshold for crossrefs.

       <b>--named-annotation-marker=[marker]</b>
           Sets the separator between the "--annotation-marker" and the name of a named annotation. The  default
           is ":".

       <b>--namesep=[sep]</b>
           Use <u>sep</u> as the separator for BibTeX data source name fields. Defaults to BibTeX's usual 'and'.

       <b>--no-bblxml-schema</b>
           When writing bblxml output, don't generate an RNG XML schema from the data model.

       <b>--no-bltxml-schema</b>
           When  reading  or  writing  biblatexml  data  sources, don't generate an RNG XML schema from the data
           model.

       <b>--noconf</b>
           Don't look for a configfile.

       <b>--no-default-datamodel</b>
           Do not load the default datamodel coming from either the <u>.bcf</u> or, when in tool mode, from the default
           tool mode config file. Use of this option implies that you will provide a  complete  datamodel  in  a
           config file. This option is useful when you wish to make major modifications to the datamodel because
           the  simple add/modify operations to the default datamodel via a user config file are not enough. For
           example, to remove things from the default  datamodel,  you  would  use  this  option  and  supply  a
           complete, reduced datamodel in the user config file.

       <b>--nodieonerror</b>
           Don't  exit  on errors, just log and continue as far as possible.  This can be useful if the error is
           something from, for example, the underlying BibTeX parsing C library which can complain about parsing
           errors which can be ignored.

       <b>--glob-datasources</b>
           By default, glob (expand according to pattern) any data source filenames.  Allows data sources to  be
           specified  like  <b>*.bib</b>  to  load  all <b>.bib</b> files in a directory. Can be overridden on a per-dataource
           basis with the <b>glob</b> option to <b>\addbibresource</b> in biblatex.

       <b>--nolog</b>
           Do not write any logfile.

       <b>--noskipduplicates</b>
           Don't skip duplicate bibliography keys if found. The detection of duplicate keys is done  across  all
           data  sources.  Sometimes  you  might  need duplicates when using several data sources across several
           refsections in which case you might need to use this option.

       <b>--nostdmacros</b>
           Don't automatically define any standard macros like month abbreviations.  If you  also  define  these
           yourself, this option can be used to suppress macro redefinition warnings.

       <b>--noremove-tmp-dir</b>
           Do  not  remove  the  temporary  directory  used  for various intermediate files and data before exit
           (default is false). Name of the directory can be obtained with the <b>--show-tmp-dir</b> option.

       <b>--noxname</b>
           Disable exended name processing in bibtex data sources. Can be useful if you don't use  this  and  it
           causes problems due to auto-detection of extended name format.

       <b>--onlylog</b>
           Do not write any message to screen.

       <b>--others-string=[string]</b>
           Use  <u>string</u>  as  the  final  name  in  a name field which implies "et al". Defaults to BibTeX's usual
           'others'.

       <b>--output-align</b>
           Align field values in neat columns in output. Effect depends on the output format. Default is  false.
           The legacy option <b>--tool-align</b> is supported as an alias.

       <b>--output-all-macrodefs</b>
           When outputting bibtex format, whether to output all found macro (@STRING entries) definitions rather
           than just definitions for macros which are actually used in the output entries. Default is false.

       <b>--output-annotation-marker=[marker]</b>
           As <b>--annotation-marker</b> but for tool mode bibtex output. The default is "+an".

       <b>--output-named-annotation-marker=[marker]</b>
           As <b>--named-annotation-marker</b> but for tool mode bibtex output. The default is ":".

       <b>--output-directory</b> <b>[directory]</b>
           Output  files  (including  log files) are output to <u>directory</u> instead of the current directory. Input
           files are also looked for in <u>directory</u> before current directory unless  "--input-directory"  is  also
           specified   in   which  case  input  files  are  only  looked  for  in  the  directory  specified  by
           "--input-directory".

       <b>--output-encoding|-E</b> <b>[encoding]</b>
           Specify the encoding of the output ".bbl" file. Default is "UTF-8".  Normally it's not  necessary  to
           set  this  as  it's  passed  via  the  .bcf  file from biblatex's "texencoding" option.  See "perldoc
           Encode::Supported" for a list of supported encodings.  The legacy option <b>--bblencoding</b>  is  supported
           as an alias.

       <b>--output-fieldcase=upper|lower|title</b>
           Case  for  field  names output. Effect depends on the output format. Defaults to 'upper'.  The legacy
           option <b>--tool-fieldcase</b> is supported as an alias.

       <b>--output-field-order=[field1,</b> <b>...</b> <b>fieldn]</b>
           When outputting bibtex format data in tool mode, this option allows the customisation of the order of
           fields within entries. The value is a comma-separated string of field names  or  classes  of  fields.
           Fields  not  mentioned  in  the  list  are output in sorted name order after the explicitly specified
           fields. The classes of fields are:

           'names' - All name list fields 'lists' - All non-name list fields 'dates' - All date fields

           By default, its value is 'options,abstract,names,lists,dates'.

       <b>--output-field-replace=[field1:replacefield1,</b> <b>...</b> <b>fieldn:replacefieldn]</b>
           When outputting bibtex format output "replacefieldn" instead of "fieldn".  This can be used to output
           legacy     formats     which     undo      the      default      driver      source      map      e.g
           <b>--output-field-replace=location:address,journaltitle:journal</b>.  See  <b>--output-legacy-dates</b>  if  legacy
           (YEAR/MONTH) date fields are required in bibtex format output.

       <b>--output-file|-O</b> <b>[file]</b>
           Output to <u>file</u> instead of <u>basename.bbl</u> <u>file</u> is relative to <b>--output-directory</b>, if set (absolute paths
           in this case are stripped to filename only). <u>file</u> can be absolute if <b>--output-directory</b> is  not  set.
           <u>file</u> can be '-' to output directly to STDOUT. The legacy option <b>--outfile</b> is supported as an alias.

       <b>--output-format=dot|bibtex|biblatexml|bbl|bblxml|bibjson</b>
           Biber  output  format.  Default  if not specified is of course, <u>bbl</u>. Use <u>dot</u> to output a GraphViz DOT
           file instead of <u>.bbl</u>. This is a directed graph of the  bibliography  data  showing  entries  and,  as
           requested,  sections  and fields.  You must process this file with "dot", e.g. "dot -Tsvg test.dot -o
           test.svg" to render the graph. See the <b>--dot-include</b> option to select what is  included  in  the  DOT
           output.  <u>bblxml</u> is an XML version of the <u>bbl</u> format which you could transform using XSLT. By default,
           when outputting <u>bblxml</u>, a RelaxNG XML schema is generated from the active data model and saved with a
           <u>rng</u> extension along with the output file name (unless the <b>--no-bblxml-schema</b>  option  is  specified).
           You  may  validate  the <u>bblxml</u> using the schema with the <b>--validate-bblxml</b> option.  The legacy option
           <b>--outformat</b> is supported as an alias.

       <b>--output-indent=[num][t]</b>
           Indentation for body of entries in output. Effect depends on the output format. Defaults  to  2.  The
           "num"  can  be  followed by 't' to specify tabs instead of spaces. The legacy option <b>--tool-indent</b> is
           supported as an alias.

       <b>--output-legacy-dates</b>
           When outputting bibtex format, output YEAR/MONTH fields instead of DATE.  This is not possible if the
           input is not convertible to legacy format, meaning that any date to be output with legacy fields  can
           only  have  a YEAR part and perhaps a MONTH part. If a DAY or ENDYEAR part are found, the date is not
           convertible and the legacy output format will be skipped. Default is false.

       <b>--output-listsep=[sep]</b>
           As <b>--listsep</b> but for tool mode bibtex output. Defaults to BibTeX's usual 'and'.

       <b>--output-namesep=[sep]</b>
           As <b>--namesep</b> but for tool mode bibtex output. Defaults to BibTeX's usual 'and'.

       <b>--output-no-macrodefs</b>
           When outputting BibTeX format, don't output macro definitions (@STRING entries).  You might not  want
           to output macro definitions if you keep them in a separate file.

       <b>--output-resolve</b>
           Convenience  option  to  set  all  of  the  <b>--output-resolve-*</b>  options  to 'true'. The legacy option
           <b>--tool-resolve</b> is supported as an alias.

       <b>--output-resolve-xdata</b>
           Whether to resolve XDATA inheritance in tool mode or when <b>--output-format=bibtex</b> in  non  tool  mode.
           Defaults to 'false'.

       <b>--output-resolve-crossrefs</b>
           Whether  to resolve CROSSREF/XREF inheritance in tool mode or when <b>--output-format=bibtex</b> in non tool
           mode. Defaults to 'false'.

       <b>--output-resolve-sets</b>
           Whether to resolve data sets in tool mode or when <b>--output-format=bibtex</b> in non tool  mode.  Defaults
           to 'false'.

       <b>--output-safechars</b>
           Try  to convert UTF-8 chars into LaTeX macros when writing the output.  This can prevent unknown char
           errors when using PDFLaTeX and inputenc as this doesn't understand all of UTF-8. Note, it  is  better
           to  switch  to  XeTeX  or  LuaTeX  to avoid this situation. By default uses the --output-safecharsset
           "base" set of characters.  The legacy option <b>--bblsafechars</b> is supported as an alias.

       <b>--output-safecharsset=[recode</b> <b>set</b> <b>name]</b>
           The set of characters included in the conversion routine for <b>--output-safechars</b>. Set to "full" to try
           harder with a much larger set or "base" to use a basic set. Default is "base" which is fine for  most
           use  cases. You may need to load more macro packages to deal with the results of "full" (Dings, Greek
           characters, special symbols etc.). The recode sets are defined in the reencoding data file which  can
           be  customised.  See the <b>--recodedata</b> option and the PDF manual.  The legacy option <b>--bblsafecharsset</b>
           is supported as an alias. The virtual set name "null" may be specified which  effectively  turns  off
           macro encoding.

       <b>--output-xdatamarker=[marker]</b>
           As <b>--xdatamarker</b> but for tool mode output. Default is 'xdata'.

       <b>--output-xdatasep=[sep]</b>
           As <b>--xdatasep</b> but for tool mode output. Default is '-'.

       <b>--output-xname</b>
           When  output  is  a  .bib  BibTeX file in tool mode, whether to output names the eXtended BibTeX name
           field format.

       <b>--output-xnamesep=[sep]</b>
           As <b>--xnamesep</b> but for tool mode bibtex output. Default is '='.

       <b>--quiet|-q</b>
           Log only errors. If this option is used more than once, don't even log errors.

       <b>--recodedata=[file]</b>
           The data file to use for the reencoding between UTF-8 and LaTeX macros. It defines the sets specified
           with the <b>--output-safecharsset</b> and <b>--decodecharsset</b> options.  It defaults to <u>recode_data.xml</u>  in  the
           same  directory  as Biber's <u>Recode.pm</u> module.  See the PDF documentation for the format of this file.
           If this option is used, then <u>file</u> should be somewhere "kpsewhich" can find it.

       <b>--show-tmp-dir</b>
           Prints the location of the temporary directory used for various intermediate  files  and  data.  Only
           useful if <b>--noremove-tmp-dir</b> is set to true.

       <b>--sortdebug</b>
           Add comments to output with sorting keys. Useful for debugging.

       <b>--sortcase=true|false</b>
           Case-sensitive sorting (default is true).

       <b>--sortlocale|-l</b> <b>[locale]</b>
           Set  the  locale  to  be  used  for sorting. The locale is used to add CLDR tailoring to the sort (if
           available for the locale).

       <b>--sortupper=true|false</b>
           Whether to sort uppercase before lowercase when sorting (default is true).

       <b>--ssl-nointernalca</b>
           Don't try to use the default Mozilla CA certificates when using HTTPS to  fetch  remote  data.   This
           assumes  that  the  user will set one of the perl LWP::UserAgent module environment variables to find
           the CA certs.

       <b>--ssl-noverify-host</b>
           Turn off host verification when using HTTPS to fetch remote data sources.  You may need this  if  the
           SSL certificate is self-signed for example.

       <b>--strip-comments</b>
           In tool mode, strip all comments from the output file.

       <b>--tool</b>
           Run  in  tool  mode.  This  mode  is  datasource  centric rather than document centric. biber reads a
           datasource (and a config file if specified), applies the command-line and config file options to  the
           datasource  and  writes  a  new  datasource. Essentially, this allows you to change your data sources
           using biber's transformation options (such as source mapping, sorting etc.)

       <b>--tool-config</b>
           Show the location of the default tool mode config file and exit. Useful when you need  to  copy  this
           file and customise it.

       <b>--tool-noremove-missing-dependants</b>
           Use  this  option in tool mode if you don't want to remove "XREF", "CROSSREF" and "XDATA" fields from
           the output which point to a missing entry.  Useful  if  you  have  split  datafiles  where  the  e.g.
           "CROSSREF"s are in another file that you are not including in the tool mode run.

       <b>--trace|-T</b>
           Turn  on  tracing.  Also  turns  on  <b>--debug|-D</b>  and additionally provides a lot of low-level tracing
           information in the log.

       <b>-u</b>  Alias for <b>--input-encoding=UTF-8</b>

       <b>-U</b>  Alias for <b>--output-encoding=UTF-8</b>

       <b>--validate-bblxml</b>
           Schema validate bblXML output against a schema auto-generated from the BibLaTeX datamodel. The schema
           will be auto-generated with the name of the <u>.bbl</u> file with a <u>.rng</u> extension. The generated schema can
           be kept and used with standard XML editors to validate the output during XSL development.

       <b>--validate-bltxml</b>
           Schema validate BibLaTeXML datasources against a schema auto-generated from the  BibLaTeX  datamodel.
           The schema will be auto-generated with the name of the <u>.bcf</u> file with a <u>.rng</u> extension. The generated
           schema  can  be  kept and used with standard XML editors to validate the datasource during datasource
           development. The schema validation does not validate all semantic aspects of the datamodel (i.e.  the
           data model constraints)---for this use the "--validate-datamodel" option.

       <b>--validate-config</b>
           Schema validate the biber config file.

       <b>--validate-control</b>
           Schema validate the <u>.bcf</u> biblatex control file.

       <b>--validate-datamodel|-V</b>
           Validate  the  data against a data model. By default, the data model used is the one in the <u>.bcf</u> file
           (normal mode) or in the default config file whose path can be shown with the  "--tool-config"  option
           (tool  mode).  Use  "--no-default-datamodel"  to  ignore the default data model completely if you are
           using a complete data model via your own config file (with "--configfile").

       <b>--version|-v</b>
           Display version number.

       <b>--winunicode|-W</b>
           In Windows 10 1803+, turning on the 'Use Unicode UTF8 for worldwide language  support'  option  makes
           Windows  use UTF-8 instead of UTF-16 for many system APIs. If that option is enabled, use this option
           to turn off biber's UTF-16 filename support on Windows. This will result in much improved handling of
           Unicode filenames.

       <b>--wraplines|-w=[column]</b>
           Wrap lines in the <u>.bbl</u> file (or output <u>.bib</u> file in tool mode) at column <u>column</u> (default 80).

       <b>--xdatamarker=[marker]</b>
           Use <u>marker</u> as the string before "--xdatasep" which introduces an XDATA  reference  in  BibTeX  format
           data  sources.  Not  used in BibLaTeXML data sources as it has a dedicated XML attribute "xdata"' for
           this. Default is 'xdata'.

       <b>--xdatasep=[sep]</b>
           Use <u>sep</u> as the separator between XDATA sub-entry parts in the eXtended name format. See  biber  docs.
           Default is '-'.

       <b>--xnamesep=[sep]</b>
           Use  <u>sep</u> as the separator between namepart names and the namepart values in the eXtended name format.
           Also applies to XDATA references as the separator between "--xdatamarker" and  the  XDATA  reference.
           See biber docs.  Default is '='.

       <b>--xsvsep=[sep]</b>
           Use  <u>sep</u>  as  the  separator  for fields of format type "xsv" in the data model. A Perl regexp can be
           specified. Defaults to a single comma surround by optional whitespace (\s*,\s*).
