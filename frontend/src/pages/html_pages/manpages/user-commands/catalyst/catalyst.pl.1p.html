</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       catalyst - Bootstrap a Catalyst application

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       catalyst.pl [options] application-name

       'catalyst.pl' creates a skeleton for a new application, and allows you to upgrade the skeleton of your
       old application.

        Options:
          -force      don't create a .new file where a file to be created exists
          -help       display this help and exit
          -makefile   only update Makefile.PL
          -scripts    only update helper scripts

        application-name must be a valid Perl module name and can include "::",
        which will be converted to '-' in the project name.

        Examples:
           catalyst.pl My::App
           catalyst.pl MyApp

        To upgrade your app to a new version of Catalyst:
           catalyst.pl -force -scripts MyApp

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "catalyst.pl" script bootstraps a Catalyst application, creating a directory structure populated with
       skeleton files.

       The application name must be a valid Perl module name.  The name of the directory created is formed from
       the application name supplied, with double colons replaced with hyphens (so, for example, the directory
       for "My::App" is "My-App").

       Using the example application name "My::App", the application directory will contain the following items:

       README
           a skeleton README file, which you are encouraged to expand on

       Changes
           a changes file with an initial entry for the creation of the application

       Makefile.PL
           Makefile.PL uses the "Module::Install" system for packaging and distribution of the application.

       lib contains  the  application  module  ("My/App.pm")  and subdirectories for model, view, and controller
           components ("My/App/M", "My/App/V", and "My/App/C").

       root
           root directory for your web document content.  This is left empty.

       script
           a directory containing helper scripts:

           "myapp_create.pl"
               helper script to generate new component modules

           "myapp_server.pl"
               runs the generated application within a Catalyst test server,  which  can  be  used  for  testing
               without resorting to a full-blown web server configuration.

           "myapp_cgi.pl"
               runs the generated application as a CGI script

           "myapp_fastcgi.pl"
               runs the generated application as a FastCGI script

           "myapp_test.pl"
               runs an action of the generated application from the command line.

       t   test directory

       The  application  module  generated  by the "catalyst.pl" script is functional, although it reacts to all
       requests by outputting a friendly welcome screen.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       Neither "catalyst.pl" nor the generated helper script will overwrite existing files.  In fact the scripts
       will generate new versions of any existing files, adding the  extension  ".new"  to  the  filename.   The
       ".new" file is not created if would be identical to the existing file.

       This  means  you  can  re-run the scripts for example to see if newer versions of Catalyst or its plugins
       generate different code, or to see how you may have changed the generated code (although you do of course
       have all your code in a version control system anyway, don't you ...).
