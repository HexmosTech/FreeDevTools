</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ru_tts - software Russian TTS engine

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ru_tts</b> [<u>options</u>]
       <b>ru_speak</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>ru_tts</b> and <b>ru_speak</b> commands.

       <b>ru_tts</b>  is a program that takes Russian text in <b>koi8-r</b> charset on its standard input and produces digital
       sound stream in the raw linear signed 8-bit 10 kHz format on the standard output.

       Symbols ‘+’ and ‘=’ immediately after a vowel in input text are treated as strong and  weak  stress  sign
       respectively.

       <b>ru_speak</b>  is a simple wrapper around <b>ru_tts</b>. It takes Russian text on its standard input, convert it into
       the spoken speech and plays produced sound via <b>play</b> utility from the <b>sox</b> package. It accepts  input  text
       in the current locale's character encoding taking care of proper recoding.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Both programs recognize the same set of options that for convenience can be divided onto several groups.

</pre><h4><b>SPEECH</b> <b>CONTROL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These options affect general speech parameters. The most of them accept numeric value as an argument. All
       numeric  values  serve  as factors applied to a default level of the corresponding parameter.  Thus, they
       must be positive numbers and the default value  is  1.0.   Greater  value  proportionally  increases  the
       parameter level, lesser value proportionally decreases it.  Reasonable value range for various options is
       different, but any out of range value will be automatically reduced to the acceptable range.

       <b>-r</b> <b>value</b>
              Set speech rate factor. Reasonable value range is from 0.2 up to 5.0.

       <b>-p</b> <b>value</b>
              Set voice pitch factor. Reasonable value range is from 0.5 up to 3.0.

       <b>-e</b> <b>value</b>
              Set  speech  emotionality  factor.  Reasonable value range is from 0.0 (absolutely monotone speech
              without intonations) up to 1.4.

       <b>-g</b> <b>value</b>
              Set interclause gaps duration factor. If this  value  is  immediately  prepended  by  one  of  the
              following  punctuations  ‘,’, ‘.’, ‘;’, ‘:’, ‘?’, ‘!’, the factor will be applied only to the gaps
              implied by that punctuation. If the value is  prepended  by  symbol  ‘-’,  it  will  be  used  for
              intonational  gaps not caused by any punctuation. Otherwise all interclause gaps will be affected.
              Use this option several times to adjust various gaps. Lower boundary of the reasonable value range
              is always 0.0, but the upper one greatly depends on the value prepending symbol and actual  speech
              rate.

       <b>-a</b>
              Use an alternative (female) voice instead of the default one.

</pre><h4><b>NUMBERS</b> <b>INTERPRETATION</b> <b>CONTROL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       By  default point and comma inside a number both are interpreted as decimal separator. But this behaviour
       can be changed.

       <b>-d.</b>
              Only point should be treated as decimal separator.

       <b>-d,</b>
              Only comma should be treated as decimal separator.

       <b>-d-</b>
              Disable decimal separators treating. In that case integer and fractional parts will be interpreted
              as two distinct integer numbers.

</pre><h4><b>PRONUNCIATION</b> <b>DICTIONARY</b> <b>RELATED</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-s</b> <b>path</b>
              Points location of  stress  and  pronunciation  dictionary  to  use.  You  may  use  pronunciation
              dictionary shipped with the package <b>rulex</b> here.

       <b>-l</b> <b>file</b>
              Save  words  that  were not found in the dictionary in specified file. It is useful for dictionary
              developing. This option does matter only when the pronunciation dictionary itself is used.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v</b>
              Show program name and version.

       <b>-h</b>
              Show summary of options.
