       pdb_tofasta - manual page for pdb_tofasta 2.5.1

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pdb_tofasta You provided an invalid option: '-help'

       Extracts the residue sequence in a PDB file to FASTA format.

       Canonical  amino  acids  and  nucleotides  are  represented by their one-letter code while all others are
       represented by 'X'.

       The <b>-multi</b> option splits the different chains into different records in the FASTA file.

   <b>Usage:</b>
              python pdb_tofasta.py [-multi] &lt;pdb file&gt;

   <b>Example:</b>
              python pdb_tofasta.py 1CTF.pdb

       This program is part of the `pdb-tools` suite of utilities and should not be distributed isolatedly.  The
       `pdb-tools`  were  created  to  quickly  manipulate  PDB  files  using  the  terminal,  and  can  be used
       sequentially, with one tool streaming data to another. They are based on  old  FORTRAN77  code  that  was
       taking too much effort to maintain and compile. RIP.
