</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       structure-synth - application for creating 3D structures

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>structure-synth</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Structure  Synth  is  an  application  for creating 3D structures from a set of user specified rules. The
       resulting structures can be viewed in the integrated OpenGL viewer or exported to  various  formats.  The
       program  was  inspired  by the CFDG syntax by Chris Coyne, and the Context Free GUI by Mark Lentczner and
       John Horigan.

</pre><h4><b>STATES,</b> <b>TRANSFORMATIONS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Structure Synth is all about states. A state describes the current  coordinate  system  and  the  current
       coloring  mode.  The  coordinate system determines the position, orientation and size of all object drawn
       while in the current state.

       States are modified by transformations. For instance we can move the coordinate system one  unit  in  the
       x-direction  by  applying  the  transformation: { x 1 }. Similarly we can rotate the coordinate system 90
       degrees about the x-axis by applying:{ rx 90 }. States are automatically combined while parsing, that  is
       { x 1 x 1 } is equal to { x 2 }.

       States  can  be combined with rule calls to create actions. { x 2 } box is an example of a transformation
       followed by a rule call. 'box' is a built-in rule. Not surprisingly, this rule draws  a  box  located  at
       (0,0,0) -&gt; (1,1,1) in the current coordinate system.

   <b>Iterated</b> <b>actions:</b>
       It  is possible to apply iterated actions, this is done using the multiplication symbol: for instance 3 *
       { x 2 } box would be equal to creating three actions:

         { x 2 } box
         { x 4 } box
         { x 6 } box

   <b>Color</b> <b>transformations:</b>
       Similar to the spatial transformations it is also possible to  transform  the  current  rendering  color.
       Structure  Synth  uses  HSV  (Hue, Saturation and Value) for representing colors - this is perhaps not as
       familiar as the RGB color model, but offers a slightly more intuitive representation once you get used to
       it (at least that is what some people claim - personally I still find it easier think in  terms  of  red,
       green  and  blue  components).  The  color  transformations are applied using the 'hue', 'saturation' and
       'value' operators.

       The next example demonstrates both iterated actions and color transformations to draw a nice color cube:

         10 * { x 1 hue 36 } 10 * { y 1 sat 0.9 } 10 * { z 1 b 0.9 } box

       Here is another example demonstrating different kinds of transformations:

         10 * { x 2 } box
         1 * { y 2 } 10 * { x 2 rx 6 } box
         1 * { y 4 } 10 * { x 2 hue 9 } box
         1 * { y 6 } 10 * { x 2 s 0.9 } box

   <b>Built-in</b> <b>rules:</b>
       The Box is an example of one the primitives - built-in rules - in Structure  Synth.  The  other  built-in
       rules are: Sphere, Dot, Grid, Line, Cylinder, Mesh, CylinderMesh.

</pre><h4><b>MAKING</b> <b>RULES</b></h4><pre>
       Custom  rules  are  the key to creating complex and sophisticated structures. Rules are created using the
       'rule' keyword. A rule can used the same way as any built-in primitive.  The  most  important  aspect  of
       rules are, that they are able to call themselves. Take a look at the following example:

         R1

         rule R1 {
           { x 0.9 rz 6 ry 6 s 0.99  sat 0.99  } R1
           { s 2 } sphere
         }

       Notice  that this rule recursively calls itself. It would never terminate - however Structure Synth has a
       default maximum recursion depth of 1000 recursions. This value can be changes  using  the  'set  maxdepth
       xxx'  command.  Another  way  to force termination would be using the 'set maxobjects xxx' keyword, which
       makes Structure Synth keep track of the number of objects drawn.

   <b>Adding</b> <b>some</b> <b>randomness:</b>
       Now, in order to things interesting, we will probably want to create something less static  -  by  adding
       some randomness. In Structure Synth this is achieved by creating multiple definitions for the same rule:

         R1

         rule R1 {
           { x 0.9 rz 6 ry 6 s 0.99  sat 0.99  } R1
           { s 2 } sphere
         }

         rule R1  {
           { x 0.9 rz -6 ry 6 s 0.99  sat 0.99  } R1
           { s 2 } sphere
         }

       Notice  the  'R1'  rule  has two definitions. Now, whenever the Structure Synth builder needs to call the
       'R1' rule, it will choose one of the definitions at random.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Actions:</b>
       Termination criteria:

       <b>set</b> <b>maxdepth</b> <b>[integer]:</b>
              Breaks after [integer] iterations (generations). This will also serve as a upper  recursion  limit
              for all rules.

       <b>set</b> <b>maxobjects</b> <b>[integer]:</b>
              After [integer] objects have been created, the construction is terminated.

       Other:

       <b>set</b> <b>seed</b> <b>[integer]:</b>
              Allows you to set the random seed. This makes it possible to reproduce creations.

       <b>set</b> <b>background</b> <b>[color]:</b>
              Allows  you  to  set  the background color. Colors are specified as text-strings parsed using Qt's
              color parsing, allowing for standard HTML RGB specifications (e.g. #F00 or #FF0000), but also  SVG
              keyword names (e.g. red or even lightgoldenrodyellow).

   <b>Rule</b> <b>modifiers:</b>
       <b>md</b> <b>/</b> <b>maxdepth</b> <b>[integer]:</b>
              Rule  Retirement.Sets  the  maximum recursive for the rule. The rule would not execute any actions
              after this limit has been reached.

       <b>md</b> <b>/</b> <b>maxdepth</b> <b>[integer]</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>[rulename]:</b>
              Rule Retirement with substitution.Sets the maximum recursive for the rule. After  this  limit  has
              been reached [rulename] will be executed instead this rule.

       <b>w</b> <b>/</b> <b>weight</b> <b>[float]:</b>
              Ambiguous  rules.If  several  rules  are defined with the same name, a random definition is chosen
              according to the weight specified here. If no weight is specified, the  default  weight  of  1  is
              used.

   <b>Transformations:</b>
       Geometrical transformations:

       <b>x</b> <b>[float]:</b>
              X  axis  translation.  The  float argument is the offset measured in units of the local coordinate
              system.

       <b>y</b> <b>[float]:</b>
              Y axis translation. As above.

       <b>z</b> <b>[float]:</b>
              Z axis translation. As above.

       <b>rx</b> <b>[float]:</b>
              Rotation about the x axis. The 'float' argument is the angle specified in  degrees.  The  rotation
              axis  is  centered  at  the  unit  cube  in the local coordinate system: that is the rotation axis
              contains the line segment from (0, 0.5, 0.5) -&gt; (1, 0.5, 0.5).

       <b>ry</b> <b>[float]:</b>
              Rotation about the y axis. As above.

       <b>rz</b> <b>[float]:</b>
              Rotation about the z axis. As above.

       <b>s</b> <b>[float]:</b>
              Resizes the local coordinate system. Notice that the center for  the  resize  is  located  at  the
              center of the unit cube in the local system (at (0.5,0.5,0.5)).

       <b>s</b> <b>[f1]</b> <b>[f2]</b> <b>[f3]:</b>
              Resizes the local coordinate system. As above but with separate scale for each dimension.

       <b>m</b> <b>[f1]</b> <b>...</b> <b>[f9]:</b>
              Applies  the  specified  3x3  rotation  matrix to the transformation matrix for the current state.
              About the argument order: [f1],[f2],[f3] defines the first row of the matrix.

       <b>fx:</b>    Mirrors the local coordinate system about the x-axis. As above the mirroring planes is centered at
              the cube.

       <b>fy:</b>    Mirrors the local coordinate system about the y-axis.

       <b>fz:</b>    Mirrors the local coordinate system about the z-axis.

       Color space transformations:

       <b>h</b> <b>/</b> <b>hue</b> <b>[float]:</b>
              Adds the 'float' value to the hue color parameter for the current state. Hues are measured from  0
              to 360 and wraps cyclicly - i.e. a hue of 400 is equal to a hue of 40.

       <b>sat</b> <b>[float]:</b>
              Multiplies the 'float' value with the saturation color parameter for the current state. Saturation
              is measured from 0 to 1 and is clamped to this interval (i.e. values larger then 1 are set to 1).

       <b>b</b> <b>/</b> <b>brightness</b> <b>[float]:</b>
              Multiples  the 'float' value with the brightness color parameter for the current state. Brightness
              is measured from 0 to 1 and is clamped to this interval. Notice that parameter is sometimes called
              'V' or 'Value' (and the color space is often referred to as HSV).

       <b>a</b> <b>/</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>[float]:</b>
              Multiplies the 'float' value with the alpha color  parameter  for  the  current  state.  Alpha  is
              measured  from  0  to  1  and  is  clamped  to this interval. An alpha value of zero is completely
              transparent, and an alpha value of one is completely opaque.

       <b>color</b> <b>[color]:</b>
              This commands sets the color to  an  absolute  color  (most  other  transformations  are  relative
              modifications  on the current state). Colors are specified as text-strings parsed using Qt's color
              parsing, allowing for standard HTML RGB specifications  (e.g.  #F00  or  #FF0000),  but  also  SVG
              keyword names (e.g. red or even lightgoldenrodyellow).

       Drawing primitives:

       <b>box:</b>   solid box

       <b>grid:</b>  wireframe box

       <b>sphere:</b>
              the round thingy (as of now this primitive has some issues - e.g. ellipsoids are not working.)

       <b>line:</b>  along x axis, centered in y,z plane.

       <b>point:</b> centered in coordinate system.

       <b>triangle:</b>
              creates a custom polygon. Specify the coordinates as follows: Triangle[0,0,0;1,0,0;0.5,0.5,0.5]

       <b>mesh:</b>  prototype mesh

       <b>cylinder:</b>
              the symmetry axis will be the current x axis. [Not implemented]

       <b>tube:</b>  polygonal cylinder (will be drawn smoothly as the coordinate system transforms). [Not implemented]

   <b>Preprocessor</b> <b>commands:</b>
       <b>#define</b> <b>varname</b> <b>value:</b>
              substitutes every occurrence of 'varname' with 'value'. Value may contain spaces.

   <b>For</b> <b>Context</b> <b>Free</b> <b>/</b> <b>CFDG</b> <b>users:</b>
       The EisenScript syntax in Structure Synth has a lot in common with CFDG.

       There are however a few important differences:

       <b>Context</b> <b>sensitivity:</b>
              A  CFDG  script  can  be  viewed as a grammar, where the production rules are independent of their
              context - or put differently - when choosing between rules CFDG does not have any knowledge of the
              history of system. This 'Context Free' property of CFDG was deliberately omitted  in  EisenScript,
              simply for pragmatic reasons: some structures would be difficult to create without having some way
              to change the rules after a certain number of recursions.

       <b>The</b> <b>'startrule'</b> <b>statement:</b>
              in  CFDG  startrules  are  explicitly  specified. In EisenScript, a more generic approach is used:
              statements which can be used in a rule definition, can also be used at the top-level scope, so  in
              order to specify a start-rule, just write the name of the rule.

       <b>Termination</b> <b>criteria:</b>
              in  CFDG recursion automatically terminates when the objects produced are too small to be visible.
              This is a very elegant solution, but it is not easy to do in a dynamic 3D world,  where  the  user
              can  move  and  zoom with the camera. Several options exist in Structure Synth for terminating the
              rendering.

       <b>Transformation</b> <b>order:</b>
              in CFDG transformations (which CFDG refers to as adjustments) in curly brackets are not applied in
              the order of appearance, and if multiple transformations of the same type are  applied,  only  the
              last  one is actually carried out. For transformations in square brackets in CFDG the order on the
              other hand is significant. In Structure Synth the  transformation  order  is  always  significant:
              transformations are applied starting from the right-most one.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Below is an EisenScript sample:

         /*
           Sample Torus.
         */

         set maxdepth 100
         r1
         36  * { x -2 ry 10   } r1

         rule r1 maxdepth 10 {
            2 * { y -1 } 3 * { rz 15 x 1 b 0.9 h -20  } r2
            { y 1 h 12 a 0.9  rx 36 }  r1
         }

         rule r2 {
            { s 0.9 0.1 1.1 hue 10 } box // a comment
         }

         rule r2 w 2 {
            { hue 113 sat 19 a 23 s 0.1 0.9 1.1 } box
         }
