</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       email-print-mime-structure - display a tree-like view of the MIME structure of an e-mail

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>email-print-mime-structure</b> &lt;<b>message.eml</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>email-print-mime-structure</b> reads a MIME message from stdin and produces a treelike representation to
       stdout.

       If the user wants the parts numbered, they can feed the output through something like "cat -n".

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--pgpkey=</b><u>KEYFILE</u>
           <u>KEYFILE</u>  should  name  an  OpenPGP  transferable  secret  key  that  is not password-protected.  If a
           PGP/MIME-encrypted message is found on standard input, this key will be tried for decryption.  May be
           used multiple times if you want to try decrypting with more than one secret key.

           OpenPGP secret keys listed in <b>--pgpkey=</b> are used ephemerally, and do  not  interact  with  any  local
           GnuPG keyring.

       <b>--cmskey=</b><u>KEYFILE</u>
           <u>KEYFILE</u>  should  name  a PEM- or DER-encoded X.509 private key that is not password-protected.  If an
           S/MIME-encrypted message that uses CMS is found on  standard  input,  this  key  will  be  tried  for
           decryption.  May be used multiple times if you want to try decrypting with more than one such key.

           X.509 private keys listed in <b>--cmskey=</b> are used ephemerally, and do not interact with any local GnuPG
           keyring.

       <b>--use-gpg-agent</b>
           If  this  flag  is present, and <b>email-print-mime-structure</b> encounters a PGP/MIME- or S/MIME-encrypted
           part, it will try to decrypt the part using the secret keys found in the local installation of GnuPG.

           If <b>--use-gpg-agent</b> is supplied along with either <b>--pgpkey=</b><u>KEYFILE</u> or <b>--cmskey=</b><u>KEYFILE</u> arguments,  the
           <u>KEYFILE</u> arguments will be tried before falling back to GnuPG.

           If  <b>email-print-mime-structure</b>  has  been asked to decrypt parts with either <b>--pgpkey=</b><u>KEYFILE</u> or with
           <b>--use-gpg-agent</b>, and it is unable to decrypt an encrypted part, it will emit a warning to stderr.

       <b>--no-use-gpg-agent</b>
           Don't try to decrypt PGP/MIME- or S/MIME-encrypted  parts  using  secret  keys  found  in  the  local
           installation of GnuPG.  This is the default.

       <b>--help</b>, <b>-h</b>
           Show usage instructions.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
           $ email-print-mime-structure &lt;test.eml
           └┬╴multipart/signed 6546 bytes
            ├─╴text/plain inline 895 bytes
            └─╴application/pgp-signature inline [signature.asc] 836 bytes

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>email-print-mime-structure</b>'s  output is not stable, and is not intended to be interpreted by machines, so
       please do not depend on it in scripts!

       <b>email-print-mime-structure</b> displays some data from within the e-mail, but does  not  sanitize  it  before
       display.   Some  particularly  cleverly-malformed  MIME  parameters  might  be  able  to  induce apparent
       formatting changes or emit arbitrary characters to stdout.

       <b>email-print-mime-structure</b> expects to be run in a UTF-8-friendly environment.
