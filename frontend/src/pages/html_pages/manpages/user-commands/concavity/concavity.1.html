</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       concavity - predictor of protein ligand binding sites from structure and conservation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       concavity [options] PDBFILE OUTPUT_NAME

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       ConCavity predicts protein ligand binding sites by combining evolutionary sequence conservation and 3D
       structure.

       ConCavity takes as input a PDB format protein structure <b>PDBFILE</b> and optionally files that characterize
       the evolutionary sequence conservation of the chains in the structure file.

       The following result files are produced by default:

       •   Residue ligand binding predictions for each chain (*.scores).

       •   Residue  ligand  binding  predictions in a PDB format file (residue scores placed in the temp. factor
           field, *_residue.pdb).

       •   Pocket prediction locations in a DX format file (*.dx).

       •   PyMOL script to visualize the predictions (*.pml).

       To visualize the predictions in PyMol (it if is installed on your system),  load  the  script  by  typing
       "pymol 1G6C_test1.pml" at the prompt or by loading it through the pymol interface.

       The  PDB  and DX files can be input into other molecular viewers if preferred.  Several additional output
       formats are available; see below. Note that the residue numbering in the .scores files may not match that
       of the PDB file.

       The ConCavity approach proceeds in three conceptual steps: grid creation, pocket extraction, and  residue
       mapping (see Methods in paper). First, the structural and evolutionary properties of the protein are used
       to  create  a  regular 3D grid surrounding the protein in which the score associated with each grid point
       represents an estimated likelihood that it overlaps a bound ligand atom. Second,  groups  of  contiguous,
       high-scoring  grid  points  are  clustered  to  extract  pockets  that  adhere  to  given  shape and size
       constraints. Finally, every protein residue is scored with an estimate of how likely it is to bind  to  a
       ligand based on its proximity to extracted pockets.

       Each of the algorithms described for these steps is implemented in concavity.  See the examples.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>PDBFILE</b> is a protein structure file in PDB format.  <b>OUTPUT_NAME</b> becomes part of the output file names and
       may not contain "/".  Output is written to the current directory.

   <b>Input</b>
       <b>-conservation</b> <u>PATH</u>
           If  the  "-conservation"  option is not given, then conservation information is not considered.  Note
           that there are separate conservation files for each protein chain in the structure, and the input  to
           the -conservation option is the prefix of these files.  Pre-computed conservation files available for
           almost  the  entire  PQS  on  the ConCavity web site.  If you'd like to compute sequence conservation
           values     for     your     own     alignments,     we     recommend     the      JSD      algorithm:
           &lt;<a href="http://compbio.cs.princeton.edu/conservation/">http://compbio.cs.princeton.edu/conservation/</a>&gt;,   available   as   <b><a href="../man1/score_conservation.1.html">score_conservation</a></b>(1)   from  the
           conservation-code package.

   <b>Grid</b> <b>Creation</b>
       <b>-grid_method</b> <u>ligsite|surfnet|pocketfinder|custom</u>
       <b>-resolution</b> <u>int</u> <u>int</u> <u>int</u>
           Set the grid resolution.

       <b>-spacing</b> <u>float</u>
           Set the grid spacing.

   <b>Pocket</b> <b>Extraction</b>
       <b>-extraction_method</b> <u>search|topn|custom</u>
       <b>-extraction_threshold_range_cutoff</b> <u>FLOAT</u>
           Stop the iterative <u>search</u> method when  the  diameter  of  the  binary  search  window  is  less  than
           <b>-extraction_threshold_range_cutoff</b> * upper_threshold. Recommended value: <u>1e-6</u>. Default: <u>0</u>.

   <b>Residue</b> <b>Mapping</b>
       <b>-res_map_method</b> <u>blur|dist|dist-thresh|custom</u>

       Each  of  these  algorithms is described in the text, and each has a number of additional parameters that
       change their behavior.  The "custom" option allows you to set the values of all parameters for each  step
       yourself.   The  presets (e.g. ligsite, search, blur) may override values you set on the command line, so
       use "custom" to have complete control.

   <b>Output</b>
       There are also several output format options.  Pocket  prediction  grid  values  can  be  output  in  the
       following formats:

       <b>-print_grid_dx</b> <u>0|1</u>
           DX format.  This is <u>1</u> by default.

       <b>-print_grid_pdb</b> <u>0|1</u>
           PDB  format.  The  residue predictions are output as a PDB file with the residue scores mapped to the
           temp. factor field and pocket numbers to the residue sequence field.

       <b>-print_grid_txt</b> <u>0|1</u>
           Raw text.

       <b>-v</b>  Verbose mode.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Note: you may have to copy and uncompress the example data files before running the following examples.

       1.  This will run concavity with default values (equivalent to ConCavity^L in the paper) on the structure
           1G6C.pdb and consider the conservation values found in conservation_data/.  This set  of  predictions
           will be called "test1".  This produces the following default result files in the current directory:

            concavity -conservation /usr/share/doc/concavity/examples/conservation_data/1G6C /usr/share/doc/concavity/examples/1G6C.pdb test1

       2.  For  example  to  score  the  structure 1G6C.pdb with ConCavity_Pocketfinder, Search, and Blur, you'd
           type:

            concavity -conservation /usr/share/doc/concavity/examples/conservation_data/1G6C -grid_method pocketfinder -extraction_method search -res_map_method blur /usr/share/doc/concavity/examples/1G6C.pdb cc-pocketfinder_search_blur

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The authors primarily use PyMol and Chimera for visualization, but the range of output formats means  you
       should  be able to import the data into most structural analysis program.  Let us know if there are other
       output formats you'd like to see.
