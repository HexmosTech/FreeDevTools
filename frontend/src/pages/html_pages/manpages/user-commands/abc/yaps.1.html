</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>YAPS</b> - converts an abc file to a PostScript file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       yaps  abc file  [-d]  [-e &lt;list&gt;]  [-E]  [-l]  [-M  XXXxYYY] [-N] [-k nn] [-o file name] [-P -ss] [-s XX]
       [-V][-ver] [-x] [-OCC]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b>     For debugging only. Displays the internal data structures used in the program.

       <b>-e</b> <b>&lt;list&gt;</b>
              Draws tunes with reference numbers in a comma separated list. Spaces are not allowed but  a  range
              of reference numbers can be specified. For example, 1,3,7-10.

       <b>-E</b>     Generates Encapsulated Postscript output.

       <b>-M</b> <b>XXXxYYY</b>
              Set margin sizes in points where 28.3 points = 1cm and 72 points = 1 inch.

       <b>-N</b>     Adds page numbering.

       <b>-k</b> <b>[nn]</b>
              Adds bar numbering. If number nn is included, then every nn'th bar is numbered. Otherwise all bars
              are numbered.

       <b>-o</b> <b>filename</b>
              Specifies the output postscript file name.

       <b>-P</b> <b>ss</b>  Specifies  the paper size where 0 is A4 and 1 is US Letter or XXXxYYY sets the paper size in point
              units.
               units.

       <b>-s</b> <b>XX</b>  Specifies the scaling factor (default is 0.7)

       <b>-V</b>     Voices are printed out separately for a multi-voice tune. Otherwise they
               are interleaved.

       <b>-ver</b>   Prints version number and exits.

       <b>-x</b>     Print tune number in X: field

       <b>-OCC</b>   Required if the tune uses the old convention for chords delineated with +..+ instead of [...].

</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       * Uses the abc2midi parsing code, so hopefully compatibility with abc2midi will be good.

       * Measures the width of lyric text for lyric typesetting.

       * Uses dynamically extensible data structures in  most  places,  so  you  should  not  be  restricted  by
       compiled-in limits.

       * Multiple voices drawn with notes played at the same time aligned.

       * Supports special characters using ISO latin 1 font. Special characters are created with a TeX-like code
       e.g. Â´E or a 3 digit octal code e.g. 315 .

       * Supports the following clefs : baritone, tenor, alto, mezzo, soprano, treble, bass. Recommended use is

       * Invisible rests (x) are displayed like normal rests.

       * Nonnumeric voice id's, eg. V: soprano are accepted.

         I:clef=bass

       To  make  it easier to enter tunes in clefs othan than treble clef, yaps supports I:octave=-1 to indicate
       that a C in the tune represents the note one octave below the pitch defined in the  abc  standard.  These
       may be combined in one I: statement e.g.

       I:clef=bass octave=-2

       You  can  also  use  clefs  that  are  one,  two  or three octaves higher or lower than normal using e.g.
       treble-8, treble+15, treble-22. The clef is drawn with a small 8, 15  or  22  above  or  below  the  clef
       symbol. The clef= and octave= commands may also go in the K: field e.g.

       K:G clef=bass-8 octave=-3

       Note  that  there  is an incompatibility between the behaviour of yaps and the behaviour of abc2ps 1.3.3.
       abc2ps 1.3.3 does not  support  the  I:octave=N  command,  but  selecting  certain  clefs  causes  it  to
       automatically transpose by several octaves. You can produce abc that works for both by following the clef
       change with an I:octave=N command to do the transpose that abc2ps does automatically.

       * Produces boxed part labels.

       * Supports the segno symbol with !segno! and coda with !coda! . Other musical instructions such as !fine!
       and  !D.C.!  come  out  as  text.  * Supports the U: field for abbreviating symbols to single characters.
       e.g.

       U:S = !segno!

       allows S to be used to produce the segno symbol. Currently this only allows new symbols to be defined and
       does not allow the existing pre-defined symbols M,L,R,H and T to be altered.

       * Supports the !red! and !black! instructions for switching from black to red or vice-versa.

       * Supports the following abc2ps extensions to abc :

          %%newpage  - start a new page,
          %%vskip N  - adds vertical space of N points. If N is followed by
                       'cm' or 'in' the units are taken as centimetres or
                       inches instead of points e.g. 4cm.
          %%text     - print text
          %%centre (or %%center for Americans) - print centred text.
          If %%text or %%centre appear in the header, the text appears above
          the tune.

          %%staffsep SIZE - set the vertical blank space between 2 consecutive
                            music staves.

          %%titleleft N - select title placed to the left or centred. N = 1
                          places the title on the left while N = 0 centres it.
          %%titlecaps - title is displayed in upper case (capital) letters.
          %%textfont NAME SIZE - select font called NAME and point size SIZE
          for text produced by %%text or %%centre. If only NAME is given, the
          font stays the same size. Likewise, if '-' is given as the NAME,
          only the font size changes.
          %%titlefont NAME SIZE - select font for title.
          %%subtitlefont NAME SIZE - select font for titles after the first
          title.
          %%composerfont NAME SIZE - select font for words in C: and O: fields
                                    and part specifier (P: in header).
          %%wordsfont NAME SIZE - select font for words in W: fields.
          %%partsfont NAME SIZE - select font for boxed parts and
          !instruction! .
          %%vocalfont NAME SIZE - select font for words in w: fields.
          %%gchordfont NAME SIZE - select font for guitar chords in the music.
          (It is advisable not to change the font name for the last two, since
           the program calculates the width of strings using default fonts)
          %%titlespace, %%subtitlespace, %%textspace, %%composerspace,
          %%wordsspace, %%partsspace, %%vocalspace and %%gchordspace
          determine the amount of space left above the relevant type
          of text. Each of these should be followed by a size in points
          or value in centrimetres or inches.
          e.g. %%composerfont 3
               %%titlefont 2cm

       * Supports placing of accompaniment chords either above or below the
         stave.

          %%chordsabove - places accompaniment chords above the stave
          (default).
          %%chordsbelow - places accompaniment chords below the stave.

       * Supports optional text enclosed in quotes before and after the
         tempo specification in the Q: field. This extension comes from
         abc2ps.
