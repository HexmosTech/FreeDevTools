</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-annex-resolvemerge - resolve merge conflicts

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       git annex resolvemerge

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Automatically  resolves  a  conflicted merge. This is done automatically when using <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>sync</b> or <b>git</b>
       <b>annex</b> <b>merge</b>.

       When two trees being merged contain conflicting versions of an annexed file, the merge conflict  will  be
       resolved by adding both versions to the tree, using variants of the filename.

       When one tree modified the file, and the other tree deleted the file, the merge conflict will be resolved
       by adding the modified file using a variant of the filename, leaving the original filename deleted.

       When  the  merge  conflict  involves  a file that is annexed in one tree, but is not annexed in the other
       tree, it is resolved by keeping the non-annexed file as-is,  and  adding  the  annexed  version  using  a
       variant of the filename.

       Note  that  only  merge  conflicts  that  involve one or more annexed files are resolved. Merge conflicts
       between two files that are not annexed will not be automatically resolved.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Suppose Alice commits a change to annexed file <b>foo</b>, and Bob commits a different change to the  same  file
       <b>foo</b>.

       Merging  between  them  will then fail, and git will present the merge conflict as a file <b>foo</b> pointing to
       one version of the git-annex symlink, with <b>git</b> <b>status</b> indicating that <b>foo</b> has an unresolved conflict.

       Running <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>resolvemerge</b> in this situation will resolve the merge conflict, by replacing  the  file
       <b>foo</b>  with  files  named like <b>foo.variant-c696</b> and <b>foo.variant-f16a</b>. One of the files has the content that
       Alice committed, and the other has the content that Bob committed.

       The user can then examine the two variants of the file, and either merge the two changes  into  a  single
       file, or rename one of them back to <b>foo</b> and delete the other.

       Now  suppose  Alice  commits  a change to annexed file <b>bar</b>, while Bob commits a deletion of the same file
       <b>bar</b>. Merging will fail. Running <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>resolvemerge</b> in this situation will resolve the merge  conflict
       by  making  a  file  with  a  name like <b>bar.variant-421f</b> containing Alice's version. The <b>bar</b> file remains
       deleted. The user can later examine the variant of the file and either rename it back to <b>bar</b>,  or  decide
       to delete it too.
