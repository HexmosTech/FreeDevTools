</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       chown - change file owner and group

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>chown</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>OWNER</u>][<u>:</u>[<u>GROUP</u>]] <u>FILE</u>...
       <b>chown</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... <u>--reference=RFILE</u> <u>FILE</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of <b>chown</b>.  <b>chown</b> changes the user and/or group ownership of
       each given file.  If only an owner (a user name or numeric user ID) is given, that user is made the owner
       of each given file, and the files' group is not changed.  If the owner is followed by a colon and a group
       name (or numeric group ID), with no spaces between them, the group ownership of the files is  changed  as
       well.   If  a colon but no group name follows the user name, that user is made the owner of the files and
       the group of the files is changed to that user's login group.  If the colon and group are given, but  the
       owner  is omitted, only the group of the files is changed; in this case, <b>chown</b> performs the same function
       as <b>chgrp</b>.  If only a colon is given, or if the entire operand is empty, neither the owner nor  the  group
       is changed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Change the owner and/or group of each FILE to OWNER and/or GROUP.  With <b>--reference</b>, change the owner and
       group of each FILE to those of RFILE.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--changes</b>
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--silent</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              suppress most error messages

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       <b>--dereference</b>
              affect  the  referent  of  each symbolic link (this is the default), rather than the symbolic link
              itself

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--no-dereference</b>
              affect symbolic links instead of any referenced file (useful only on systems that can  change  the
              ownership of a symlink)

       <b>--from</b>=<u>CURRENT_OWNER</u>:CURRENT_GROUP
              change  the  ownership  of  each file only if its current owner and/or group match those specified
              here. Either may be omitted, in which case a match is not required for the omitted attribute

       <b>--no-preserve-root</b>
              do not treat '/' specially (the default)

       <b>--preserve-root</b>
              fail to operate recursively on '/'

       <b>--reference</b>=<u>RFILE</u>
              use RFILE's ownership rather than specifying values RFILE is always  dereferenced  if  a  symbolic
              link.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
              operate on files and directories recursively

       The  following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when the <b>-R</b> option is also specified.  If more
       than one is specified, only the final one takes effect. '-P' is the default.

       <b>-H</b>     if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a directory, traverse it

       <b>-L</b>     traverse every symbolic link to a directory encountered

       <b>-P</b>     do not traverse any symbolic links

       <b>--help</b> display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       Owner is unchanged if missing.  Group is unchanged if missing, but changed to login group if implied by a
       ':' following a symbolic OWNER.  OWNER and GROUP may be numeric as well as symbolic.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       chown root /u
              Change the owner of /u to "root".

       chown root:staff /u
              Likewise, but also change its group to "staff".

       chown -hR root /u
              Change the owner of /u and subfiles to "root".
