       chmod - change file mode bits

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>chmod</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... <u>MODE</u>[<u>,MODE</u>]... <u>FILE</u>...
       <b>chmod</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... <u>OCTAL-MODE</u> <u>FILE</u>...
       <b>chmod</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... <u>--reference=RFILE</u> <u>FILE</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents the GNU version of <b>chmod</b>.  <b>chmod</b> changes the file mode bits of each given file
       according  to  <u>mode</u>, which can be either a symbolic representation of changes to make, or an octal number
       representing the bit pattern for the new mode bits.

       The format of a symbolic mode is [<b>ugoa</b>...][[<b>-+=</b>][<u>perms</u>...]...],  where  <u>perms</u>  is  either  zero  or  more
       letters  from the set <b>rwxXst</b>, or a single letter from the set <b>ugo</b>.  Multiple symbolic modes can be given,
       separated by commas.

       A combination of the letters <b>ugoa</b> controls which users' access to the file will be changed: the user  who
       owns  it  (<b>u</b>), other users in the file's group (<b>g</b>), other users not in the file's group (<b>o</b>), or all users
       (<b>a</b>).  If none of these are given, the effect is as if (<b>a</b>) were given, but bits that are set in the  umask
       are not affected.

       The  operator  <b>+</b>  causes  the  selected file mode bits to be added to the existing file mode bits of each
       file; <b>-</b> causes them to be removed; and <b>=</b> causes them to be  added  and  causes  unmentioned  bits  to  be
       removed except that a directory's unmentioned set user and group ID bits are not affected.

       The  letters <b>rwxXst</b> select file mode bits for the affected users: read (<b>r</b>), write (<b>w</b>), execute (or search
       for directories) (<b>x</b>), execute/search only if the file is a directory or already  has  execute  permission
       for  some  user  (<b>X</b>),  set user or group ID on execution (<b>s</b>), restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (<b>t</b>).
       Instead of one or more of these letters, you can specify exactly one of the letters <b>ugo</b>: the  permissions
       granted  to the user who owns the file (<b>u</b>), the permissions granted to other users who are members of the
       file's group (<b>g</b>), and the permissions granted  to  users  that  are  in  neither  of  the  two  preceding
       categories (<b>o</b>).

       A  numeric  mode  is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding up the bits with values 4, 2,
       and 1.  Omitted digits are assumed to be leading zeros.  The first digit selects the set user ID (4)  and
       set  group ID (2) and restricted deletion or sticky (1) attributes.  The second digit selects permissions
       for the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute (1); the third selects  permissions  for
       other  users  in the file's group, with the same values; and the fourth for other users not in the file's
       group, with the same values.

       <b>chmod</b> doesn't change the permissions of symbolic  links;  the  <b>chmod</b>  system  call  cannot  change  their
       permissions  on  most  systems, and most systems ignore permissions of symbolic links.  However, for each
       symbolic link listed on the command line, <b>chmod</b> changes the  permissions  of  the  pointed-to  file.   In
       contrast,  <b>chmod</b>  ignores  symbolic links encountered during recursive directory traversals. Options that
       modify this behavior are described in the <b>OPTIONS</b> section.

</pre><h4><b>SETUID</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SETGID</b> <b>BITS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>chmod</b> clears the set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the file's group ID  does  not  match  the  user's
       effective  group  ID  or  one  of  the  user's  supplementary  group IDs, unless the user has appropriate
       privileges.  Additional restrictions may cause the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of <u>MODE</u> or <u>RFILE</u>  to
       be  ignored.   This behavior depends on the policy and functionality of the underlying <b>chmod</b> system call.
       When in doubt, check the underlying system behavior.

       For directories  <b>chmod</b>  preserves  set-user-ID  and  set-group-ID  bits  unless  you  explicitly  specify
       otherwise.   You can set or clear the bits with symbolic modes like <b>u+s</b> and <b>g-s</b>.  To clear these bits for
       directories with a numeric mode requires an additional leading zero like <b>00755</b>, leading minus like <b>-6000</b>,
       or leading equals like <b>=755</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTED</b> <b>DELETION</b> <b>FLAG</b> <b>OR</b> <b>STICKY</b> <b>BIT</b></h4><pre>
       The restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose  interpretation  depends  on  the  file
       type.   For directories, it prevents unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file in the directory
       unless they own the file or the directory; this is called the <u>restricted</u> <u>deletion</u> <u>flag</u> for the directory,
       and is commonly found on world-writable directories like <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b>.  For regular files on some older  systems,
       the  bit saves the program's text image on the swap device so it will load more quickly when run; this is
       called the <u>sticky</u> <u>bit</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.  With <b>--reference</b>, change the mode of each FILE to that of RFILE.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--changes</b>
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--silent</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              suppress most error messages

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       <b>--dereference</b>
              affect the referent of each symbolic link, rather than the symbolic link itself

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--no-dereference</b>
              affect each symbolic link, rather than the referent

       <b>--no-preserve-root</b>
              do not treat '/' specially (the default)

       <b>--preserve-root</b>
              fail to operate recursively on '/'

       <b>--reference</b>=<u>RFILE</u>
              use RFILE's mode instead of specifying MODE values.  RFILE is always dereferenced  if  a  symbolic
              link.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
              change files and directories recursively

       The  following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when the <b>-R</b> option is also specified.  If more
       than one is specified, only the final one takes effect. '-H' is the default.

       <b>-H</b>     if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a directory, traverse it

       <b>-L</b>     traverse every symbolic link to a directory encountered

       <b>-P</b>     do not traverse any symbolic links

       <b>--help</b> display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       Each MODE is of the form '[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+|[-+=][0-7]+'.
