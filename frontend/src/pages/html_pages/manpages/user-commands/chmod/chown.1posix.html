</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       chown — change the file ownership

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       chown <b>[</b>-h<b>]</b> <u>owner</u><b>[</b>:<u>group</u><b>]</b> <u>file</u>...

       chown -R <b>[</b>-H|-L|-P<b>]</b> <u>owner</u><b>[</b>:<u>group</u><b>]</b> <u>file</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>chown</u>  utility shall set the user ID of the file named by each <u>file</u> operand to the user ID specified
       by the <u>owner</u> operand.

       For each <u>file</u> operand, or, if the <b>-R</b> option is used, each file encountered while  walking  the  directory
       trees  specified  by the <u>file</u> operands, the <u>chown</u> utility shall perform actions equivalent to the <u>chown</u>()
       function defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, called with the following arguments:

        1. The <u>file</u> operand shall be used as the <u>path</u> argument.

        2. The user ID indicated by the <u>owner</u> portion of the first operand shall be used as the <u>owner</u> argument.

        3. If the <u>group</u> portion of the first operand is given, the group ID indicated by it shall be used as the
           <u>group</u> argument; otherwise, the group ownership shall not be changed.

       Unless <u>chown</u> is invoked by a process with appropriate privileges, the set-user-ID and  set-group-ID  bits
       of  a  regular file shall be cleared upon successful completion; the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of
       other file types may be cleared.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>chown</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-h</b>        For  each  file operand that names a file of type symbolic link, <u>chown</u> shall attempt to set the
                 user ID of the symbolic link. If a group ID was specified, for each file operand that  names  a
                 file of type symbolic link, <u>chown</u> shall attempt to set the group ID of the symbolic link.

       <b>-H</b>        If  the  <b>-R</b>  option  is  specified  and a symbolic link referencing a file of type directory is
                 specified on the command line, <u>chown</u> shall change the user ID (and group ID, if  specified)  of
                 the directory referenced by the symbolic link and all files in the file hierarchy below it.

       <b>-L</b>        If  the  <b>-R</b>  option  is  specified  and a symbolic link referencing a file of type directory is
                 specified on the command line or encountered during the traversal of a  file  hierarchy,  <u>chown</u>
                 shall  change  the  user  ID  (and  group  ID, if specified) of the directory referenced by the
                 symbolic link and all files in the file hierarchy below it.

       <b>-P</b>        If the <b>-R</b> option is specified and  a  symbolic  link  is  specified  on  the  command  line  or
                 encountered  during  the  traversal  of  a file hierarchy, <u>chown</u> shall change the owner ID (and
                 group ID, if specified) of the symbolic link. The <u>chown</u> utility shall not follow  the  symbolic
                 link to any other part of the file hierarchy.

       <b>-R</b>        Recursively change file user and group IDs. For each <u>file</u> operand that names a directory, <u>chown</u>
                 shall  change  the  user  ID (and group ID, if specified) of the directory and all files in the
                 file hierarchy below it. Unless a <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b>, or <b>-P</b> option is specified, it is unspecified which of
                 these options will be used as the default.

       Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive options <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b>, and <b>-P</b>  shall  not  be  considered  an
       error. The last option specified shall determine the behavior of the utility.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>owner</u><b>[</b>:<u>group</u><b>]</b>
                 A  user  ID  and  optional  group ID to be assigned to <u>file</u>.  The <u>owner</u> portion of this operand
                 shall be a user name from the user database or a numeric user ID. Either specifies  a  user  ID
                 which shall be given to each file named by one of the <u>file</u> operands. If a numeric <u>owner</u> operand
                 exists  in  the user database as a user name, the user ID number associated with that user name
                 shall be used as the user ID. Similarly, if the <u>group</u> portion of this operand  is  present,  it
                 shall  be  a group name from the group database or a numeric group ID. Either specifies a group
                 ID which shall be given to each file. If a numeric group operand exists in the  group  database
                 as a group name, the group ID number associated with that group name shall be used as the group
                 ID.

       <u>file</u>      A pathname of a file whose user ID is to be modified.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>chown</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The utility executed successfully and all requested changes were made.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Only the owner of a file or the user with appropriate privileges may change the owner or group of a file.

       Some implementations restrict the use of <u>chown</u> to a user with appropriate privileges.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The System V and BSD versions use different exit status codes. Some implementations used the exit  status
       as  a  count of the number of errors that occurred; this practice is unworkable since it can overflow the
       range of valid exit status values. These are masked by specifying only 0 and &gt;0 as exit values.

       The functionality of <u>chown</u> is described substantially through  references  to  functions  in  the  System
       Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017. In this way, there is no duplication of effort required for describing
       the interactions of permissions, multiple groups, and so on.

       The  4.3  BSD  method  of  specifying  both  owner  and group was included in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017
       because:

        *  There are cases where the desired end condition could not be achieved using the <u>chgrp</u> and <u>chown</u> (that
           only changed the user ID) utilities. (If the current owner is not a member of the desired  group  and
           the  desired  owner is not a member of the current group, the <u>chown</u>() function could fail unless both
           owner and group are changed at the same time.)

        *  Even if they could be changed independently, in cases where both are being changed, there is  a  100%
           performance penalty caused by being forced to invoke both utilities.

       The  BSD  syntax  <u>user</u>[.<u>group</u>]  was  changed  to  <u>user</u>[:<u>group</u>] in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 because the
       &lt;period&gt; is a  valid  character  in  login  names  (as  specified  by  the  Base  Definitions  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017,  login  names  consist  of  characters in the portable filename character set). The &lt;colon&gt;
       character was chosen as the replacement for the &lt;period&gt; character because it would never be allowed as a
       character in a user name or group name on historical implementations.

       The <b>-R</b> option is considered by some observers as an undesirable departure from the historical UNIX system
       tools approach; since a tool, <u>find</u>, already exists to recurse over directories, there  seemed  to  be  no
       good  reason  to require other tools to have to duplicate that functionality.  However, the <b>-R</b> option was
       deemed an important user convenience, is far more efficient than forking  a  separate  process  for  each
       element of the directory hierarchy, and is in widespread historical use.
