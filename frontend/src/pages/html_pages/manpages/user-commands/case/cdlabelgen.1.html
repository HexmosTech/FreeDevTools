</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 4.2.0, April 2012

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       cdlabelgen's purpose in life is twofold:

       •   To  be run automatically and swiftly from a shell script and automatically generate a frontcard and a
           traycard for a cd--usually data archive cd's. The traycard (which  goes  behind  the  CD  itself)  is
           U-shaped  and  the ends of the CD case bear the label of what the CD is.  Inside inserts for DVDs are
           also supported.

       •   To have a minimum of dependencies--cdlabelgen only requires perl.

       cdlabelgen was designed to simplify the process of generating labels for CD's. It originated as a program
       to allow auto generation of  frontcards  and  traycards  for  CD's  burned  via  an  automated  mechanism
       (specifically for archiving data), but has now become popular for labelling CD compilations of mp3's, and
       copies of CDs. Note that cdlabelgen does not actually print anything--it just spits out postscript, which
       you  can  then  do  with  as  you please. It can also be combined with output from other programs such as
       "barcodegen" - to print a barcode as a tray overlay image.

       The   latest   version   of   cdlabelgen   as   well   as    this    document    can    be    found    at
       <a href="http://www.aczoom.com/tools/cdinsert/">http://www.aczoom.com/tools/cdinsert/</a>.  The  software  package  includes  CGI scripts that can be used to
       serve   cdlabelgen   over    the    internet.     An    older    version    may    be    available    at:
       <a href="http://www.red-bean.com/~bwf/software/cdlabelgen/">http://www.red-bean.com/~bwf/software/cdlabelgen/</a>.

       cdlabelgen  comes  with  several  eps  images for you to use on your labels. These images can be found in
       /usr/local/lib/cdlabelgen      or      /usr/share/cdlabelgen       or       /opt/lib/cdlabelgen/       or
       /usr/local/share/cdlabelgen,  depending on your installation. Included are a Recycling icon, an mp3 icon,
       the Compact Disc icon (with and without 'Digital' on it), Tux the penguin, and  the  new  Debian  'swirl'
       logo. Two color background images called Music Notes are also available.

       CDs:  cdlabelgen  prints  a  'tongue' as part of the traycard. This folds around and is viewable from the
       front in jewel boxes that are entirely clear (CD holder piece is not opaque). If you do not have a  clear
       CD  holder  in  your jewel box, you may find it easier to just cut the 'tongue' off--it's a bit easier to
       fold without it.

       Paper Sizes: Normal CD cases, Slim CD cases, DVD inside inserts can be printed on a letter  or  A4  sized
       page.  CD/DVD Envelopes and DVD outside inserts will not fit on a letter sized paper, a larger paper size
       will be needed to make it fit.

       cdlabelgen  requires  Perl  Version  5.003 or greater. Ghostscript is not required, but <b>is</b> recommended so
       that you can test out your labels without wasting paper.

</pre><h4><b>SWITCHES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c,</b> <b>--category</b> <b>&lt;category</b>&gt;
           Set the category (title) for the CD

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--subcategory</b> <b>&lt;subcategory</b>&gt;
           Set the subcategory (subtitle) for the CD

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--items</b> <b>&lt;items</b>&gt;
           'items' should be a '%' separated list of items to print on the traycard of the CD.  Note that if the
           number of items are too many to fit on the tray card, cdlabelgen will leave out  some  items  at  the
           end.   cdlabelgen  automatically  flows  the items into 2, 3, 4, or 5 columns and scales the fontsize
           accordingly, unless the "-P" option is used.  You can insert blank lines by inserting 2 percent signs
           in a row into the items list.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--items-from-file</b> <b>&lt;filename</b>&gt;
           Get item names from file named filename. Each item should be on its own line  separated  by  carriage
           returns.  cdlabelgen automatically flows the items into 2, 3, 4, or 5 columns and scales the fontsize
           or  clips  the  items  as needed.  You can insert blank lines by placing blank lines between items in
           this file.

           Special commands can be embedded in the file, all of these commands should be present starting at the
           first column of the line.  The codes are used to change the font for an item, the code itself is  not
           printed in the output.

            {#BI}     - make the item bold and italic
            {#I}      - make the item italic
            {#B}      - make the item bold
            {#M}      - make the item mono-spaced (Courier font)
            {#MB}     - make the item monospaced and bold (Courier-Bold font)

           Example:

            {#MB}    Text 1 Item
           would print the line "    Text 1 Item" in a monospaced bold font.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--cover-items</b> <b>&lt;number_of_items_for_cover</b>&gt;
           Normally,  all  the items are printed on the tray card.  But if you have a large number of items, you
           may wish to print some items on the cover, and rest on the tray card.  This option provides a way  of
           specifying  how  many  items should be printed on the cover. Default is 0 (i.e., print no item on the
           cover, print all items on the tray). The items to be printed on the cover are taken from the list  of
           items,  from  the top of the list.  Note that if the number of items is too many to fit on the cover,
           it will result in items being dropped. As of Jan 2002, around 250-300 items  can  be  fitted  on  the
           cover or the tray, depending on whether a title/subtitle/date is used or not.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--date</b> <b>&lt;date</b>&gt;
           Set the date to be used as 'date' if not set or not overridden with the <b>-D</b> flag, today's date will be
           used  (default  is  today's  date).  Use this option if you don't like cdlabelgen's default format of
           YYCC-MM-YY, for example.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--no-date</b>
           Do not print <b>any</b> date (overrides <b>-d</b> as well)

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--cover-image</b> <b>&lt;cover_epsfile</b>&gt;
           Filename of eps file to print on cover. Note that cdlabelgen requires that the  eps  file  contain  a
           proper  '%%BoundingBox  LLx LLy URx URy' declaration according to the PostScript Document Structuring
           Conventions. cdlabelgen uses this line to determine the dimensions of the eps graphic so that it  can
           position  it  appropriately  on  the  cover.  Note  that cdlabelgen first looks for this file in your
           working directory. If it doesn't find it there, it will look in the list  of  directories  where  the
           default  eps  files  are  stored  (see  @where_is_the_template). This makes it easy to use the images
           shipped with cdlabgelgen without typing miles of pathnames.

       <b>-S,</b> <b>--cover-image-scaleratio</b> <b>&lt;cover_eps_scaleratio</b> <b>[,image_x_offset,image_y_offset_inches]</b>&gt;
           The ratio by which you want to scale the epsfile that appears on the cover. If you  omit  this  flag,
           cdlabelgen  assumes  a  scaleratio  of  1.0. This flag allows you to squeeze larger graphics into the
           cover or expand smaller graphics to fill the cover. Scaleratio must be a number (int or float).

           If the scale value passed is 0 (or 0.0), then the logo is used as a background image  -  it  will  be
           scaled as required to fit the entire cover.

           The  -S option also takes optional translate arguments.  Normally images are printed on the cover and
           the tray so that the bottom-right of the image is anchored to the bottom-right of the cover or  tray.
           To move the images away from the bottom and right borders, use this option. For example, to leave two
           inches  of  gap between the image and the bottom border, and 0.5 inches from the left border, and use
           1.0 scaleratio, use this: <b>-S</b> <b>1.0,-2,0.5</b>

           This offset only applies when the image is being used as a logo - i.e., image is not  being  used  as
           background to fill the entire cover or tray.

       <b>-E,</b> <b>--tray-image</b> <b>&lt;tray_epsfile</b>&gt;
           Filename  of eps file to print on traycard. Note that cdlabelgen requires that the eps file contain a
           proper '%%BoundingBox LLx LLy URx URy' declaration according to the PostScript  Document  Structuring
           Conventions.  cdlabelgen uses this line to determine the dimensions of the eps graphic so that it can
           position it appropriately on the cover. Note that cdlabelgen  first  looks  for  this  file  in  your
           working  directory.  If  it  doesn't find it there, it will look in the list of directories where the
           default eps files are stored (see @where_is_the_template). This makes  it  easy  to  use  the  images
           shipped with cdlabgelgen without typing miles of pathnames.

       <b>-T,</b> <b>--tray-image-scaleratio</b> <b>&lt;tray_eps_scaleratio</b> <b>[,image_x_offset,image_y_offset_inches]</b>&gt;
           The ratio by which you want to scale the epsfile that appears on the traycard. If you omit this flag,
           cdlabelgen  assumes  a  scaleratio  of  1.  This  flag allows you to squeeze larger graphics into the
           traycard or expand smaller graphics to fill the traycard. Scaleratio must be a positive  number  (int
           or float) specifying the scale.

           If the scale value passed is the word <b>fill1</b>, then the image is used as a background - it is scaled so
           that it completely fills the interior tray card region.  The value <b>0</b> (or 0.0) works same as the <b>fill1</b>
           argument.

           If  the value passed is the word <b>fill2</b>, then the image is used as a background to fill more than just
           the tray.  For normal CD cases, the image is scaled so that it completely fills both  the  tray  card
           region,  and  the two endcaps (but not the extreme right-hand 'tongue-cap') for normal cd cases.  For
           Slim CD cases or DVD Inside/Outside covers, the tray image will fill both the tray and cover  regions
           (including  any  spines).   For directly printing on a CD (--create-cdlabel), fill2 option works like
           the fill1 option.

           The -T option also takes optional translate arguments.  Normally images are printed on the cover  and
           the  tray so that the bottom-right of the image is anchored to the bottom-right of the cover or tray.
           To move the images away from the bottom and right borders, use this option. For example, to leave two
           inches of gap between the image and the bottom border, and 0.5 inches from the left border,  and  use
           1.0 scaleratio, use this: <b>-T</b> <b>1.0,-2,0.5</b>

           This  offset  only  applies when the image is being used as a logo - i.e., image is not being used as
           background to fill the entire cover or tray.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--output-file</b> <b>&lt;outputfile</b>&gt;
           If the <b>-o</b> flag is used, cdlabelgen prints to outputfile instead of STDOUT.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--template</b> <b>&lt;template</b>&gt;
           Specify explicitly which template to use. This is useful if you need to debug the PostScript code  in
           the  template,  use  a different template, or if you have created your own template to use in lieu of
           the one provided with cdlabelgen.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--no-tray-plaque</b>
           Suppresses printing of the Plaque on the traycard, thus allowing you to either fit even more items on
           the traycard, or to use a slightly larger font size for the items.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--no-cover-plaque</b>
           Suppresses printing of the plaque on the front cover, thus allowing a  cover  image  that  fills  the
           front cover, but still displaying category and sub-category information in the other usual places.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
           print out the usage message

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--tray-word-wrap</b>
           Enables  word  wrapping  of the items that print on the traycard. Note that this is *not* extensively
           tested and may be buggy! Make sure that you preview your label before printing it  if  you  use  this
           flag.

           If there is a problem with "-w", the best option right now is to split lines in the input itself, and
           to omit the "-w" option.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--slim-case</b>
           Creates  covers  suitable for use in slim cd-cases, this means no tray card (the tray card is now the
           inside front cover).  This creates a two page, folding cover insert.  This  could  also  be  used  in
           normal cd cases as an inside insert.

           Slim  case  option can be used with outside dvd inserts ( --create-dvd-outside ) also - in which case
           the outside insert is created for half-height DVD case.

       <b>-O,</b> <b>--outside-foldout</b>
           Output slim cd cover cases (or dvd inserts) with the order of the pages switched so the folding  line
           lies on the outside of a normal case. Can be used when printing either the slim-cd-case or dvd-inside
           inserts.

           This option is best used along with option -m (--slim-case) or --create-dvd-inside.

       <b>--rotate-endcaps</b>
           Endcap text is rotated by 180 degrees, to flip the text around.

       <b>-M,</b> <b>--create-envelope</b>
           Creates covers suitable for use as envelopes for a CD. Guide lines are printed, to aid in folding the
           printout correctly.

       <b>--create-dvd-inside</b>
           Creates inserts suitable for use as inside insert for a normal DVD case.  Guide lines are printed, to
           aid  in  folding the printout correctly.  Note: DVD inserts may not print fully on Letter or A4 sized
           paper printers; it may require larger paper sizes.

       <b>--create-dvd-outside</b>
           Creates inserts suitable for use as outside cover inserts for a normal DVD  case.   Guide  lines  are
           printed,  to  aid in folding the printout correctly.  Note: DVD inserts may not print fully on Letter
           or A4 sized paper printers; it may require larger paper sizes.

           Slim case option ( --slim-case ) can be used with outside dvd  inserts  also  -  in  which  case  the
           outside insert is created for half-height DVD case.

       <b>--double-case</b>
           Create  covers  for  double-sided  DVD  cases  that  hold  6  DVDs.   Only double-width DVD cases are
           supported, double-width CD cases are not supported.  Therefore, using --double-case also implies  the
           --create-dvd-outside  option.   Note:  DVD  inserts  may  not print fully on Letter or A4 sized paper
           printers; it may require larger paper sizes.

       <b>--slim-double-case</b>
           Create covers for double-sided DVD cases that hold 6 DVDs in boxes 1.5 times the depth of normal  dvd
           cases.   Only DVD cases are supported with this option, slim-double-width CD cases are not supported.
           Therefore, using --slim-double-case also implies the --create-dvd-outside option.  Note: DVD  inserts
           may not print fully on Letter or A4 sized paper printers; it may require larger paper sizes.

       <b>--create-cdlabel</b>
           For  directly  printing on a CD or DVD. As of January 2005, there are inkjets printers that can print
           on certain types of blank CD/DVD discs.  Only a small number of items can be printed on the  CD,  and
           the number of characters in the title and subtitle is also limited.  Always check the output visually
           by using PostScript viewers or printing on paper, before printing on the CD.

           With  this  option, the top portion of the disc represents the "cover" area - so arguments related to
           the  cover:  title  (--category),   subtitle   (--subcategory),   --no-cover-plaque,   --cover-items,
           --cover-image,  etc  all apply to the top area.  The bottom portion of the disc represents the "tray"
           area, so arguments related to the tray: --no-tray-plaque, --tray-image, etc all apply to  the  bottom
           area.  The date (--date) string, if present, is printed along the bottom curved edge of the disc.

           Background  images  can  be  specified  using  the  --cover-image  option,  modified  as  need by the
           --cover-image-scaleratio.  If --tray-image is also specified, note that the cover  image  is  printed
           first,  then  the tray image overwrites the cover image. The title/items text is then finally printed
           over all the images.

           The --no-tray-plaque and/or --no-cover-plaque (along with --cover-items) option is  also  recommended
           with --create-cdlabel, otherwise there may be no space for any items to be printed on the disc.

           The --clip-items option is also recommended.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--clip-items</b>
           Enables  clipping  of  items;  uses fixed font size for all items.  Normally, the template.ps used by
           cdlabelgen will try to fit an item in a given column by reducing the font size if needed. This is  ok
           if  done  for one or two items, but if done too often, it makes the tray card look ugly, with text of
           varying font sizes.

           Use this option to use a fixed width font for all items. If the item is too large to fit in a column,
           the text will be clipped instead.

       <b>-y,</b> <b>--page-offset</b> <b>[&lt;page_x_offset_inches,]&lt;page_y_offset_inches</b>
           Use this to move the entire output up or down (y_offset), to make the output fit on appropriate sized
           paper. For letter sized paper, 0.8 works well, and for A4 paper, 1.5 works  well.  The  value  is  in
           units  of  inches.   An  optional  X-axis  offset  can also be specified.  Default values: 1 inch for
           X-axis, 0.8 inches for Y-axis.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--line-width</b> <b>&lt;line_width_points</b>&gt;
           Specify size in points of the edge and interior lines of the cover and tray card.  If this is 0, then
           the lines are omitted for both the cover and tray (but guide cut lines are still printed).  The  size
           is specified in points (1 point is 1/72 inch).

       <b>--plaque-color</b> <b>&lt;r,g,b</b>&gt;
           Specify  a color to fill plaque.  Color must be specified using the rgb components, each value should
           be between 0 and 255.

       <b>--category-color</b> <b>&lt;r,g,b</b>&gt;
           Specify a color for category.  Color must be specified using the rgb components, each value should be
           between 0 and 255.

       <b>--subcategory-color</b> <b>&lt;r,g,b</b>&gt;
           Specify a color for subcategory.  Color must be specified using the rgb components, each value should
           be between 0 and 255.

       <b>--text-color</b> <b>&lt;r,g,b</b>&gt;
           Specify a color for text - this is used for the list of items, and the date display under the  plaque
           and  in the end-caps.  Color must be specified using the rgb components, each value should be between
           0 and 255.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--number-in-set</b> <b>&lt;string</b>&gt;
           Append volume information to the end of the date string.  This should be a single string.  If used in
           conjunction with "-D", it will be in place of the date; otherwise, it is appended to the date as "  -
           &lt;number-in-set&gt;"

       <b>--rows-columns</b> <b>&lt;row_count_for_items,column_count_for_items</b>&gt;
           The --rows-columns options forces the list of items to be printed using that many rows, and that many
           columns.  Both numbers have to be provided, no spaces, for example: --rows-columns=11,3

           The  list  of items is laid out in top-down, left-to-right fashion.  Use blank items in the input, to
           get appropriately aligned columns.

           --rows-columns applies to the list of items wherever they are printed - normally on  the  tray  only,
           but  may  include  cover,  or  the top and bottom portions of the round printouts for direct CD label
           printing.  Same values apply to all these variations, so if you need different number of rows/columns
           for cover vs tray, you can use two different runs of cdlabelgen, to get  two  postscript  files,  and
           pick  the  cover  from one printout, and tray from the other.  This will work for jewel-case inserts,
           but may not work for direct CD label printing.

       <b>--tray-overlay</b> <b>overlay_epsfile</b>
           Filename of eps file to print as overlay on traycard. This image is printed over the background image
           (tray-image) as well as the list of items. Therefore, this is useful for things  like  barcodes.   In
           terms of EPS file requirements, see the --tray-image option description.

       <b>--tray-overlay-scaleratio</b> <b>tray_overlay_image_scaleratio[,image_x_offset,image_y_offset_inches]</b>
           The  ratio  by  which  you want to scale the epsfile that is used with the --tray-overlay option, and
           optionally to translate the overlay.  Normally overlay image is printed  on  the  tray  so  that  the
           bottom-right  of  the image is anchored to the bottom-right of the tray. To move the images away from
           the bottom and right borders, use this option. For example, to leave 0.1 inches of  gap  between  the
           image  and  the  bottom  border,  and  0.2  inches  from the right border, and use 1.0 scaleratio (no
           scaling), use this: <b>--tray-overlay-scaleratio</b> <b>1.0,-0.2,0.1</b>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
           cdlabelgen -c "My Filesystem"
                        -s "/usr/local/foo"
                        -e postscript/recycle.eps &gt; foo.ps

           cdlabelgen -c "title of cd"
                        -s "subtitle"
                        -i "Item 1%and Item 2%a third item here perhaps"
                        -e postscript/recycle.eps -o bar.ps

           cdlabelgen -c "Fitz"
                        -s "home directory"
                        -o qux.ps

           cdlabelgen -c "Backups"
                        -s "home directory"
                        -n "4 of 5"

           Direct printing on a CD or DVD, if file "example5.txt" has list of items:
           cdlabelgen --clip-items --no-tray-plaque --date "Jan 2005"
             -c "Collections 12" -s "- english songs -"
             --cover-image "music2.eps" --cover-image-scaleratio 0.0
             --tray-image "mp3.eps" --tray-image-scaleratio 0.5,-0.5,2
             --page-offset 0.5,0.5 -f example5.txt -o test.ps

</pre><h4><b>CHARACTER</b> <b>ENCODINGS</b> <b>-</b> <b>using</b> <b>ogonkify</b></h4><pre>
       cdlabelgen uses the Helvetica family of fonts for various text  items,  using  the  default  encoding  of
       ISO-Latin1.

       To  use  other  encodings,  the  "ogonkify"  program  can  be  used;  this  is  a  package  available  at
       <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/ogonkify/">http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/ogonkify/</a> The output from cdlabelgen can be piped into  ogonkify,
       example for Latin2 encoding:

          cdlabelgen &lt;args&gt;  | ogonkify -H -eL2    &gt; &lt;outputfilename&gt;

       See the man page for ogonkify for other possible values for the encoding.

       Hint:  if  you always work with a particular encoding, you can just run ogonkify on template.ps - and use
       the output as the new template.ps.

          ogonkify -H -eL2 template.ps &gt; template-enc.ps

       This way ogonkify has to be run only once, cdlabelgen output will contain  the  correctly  encoded  fonts
       from  the  modified template.ps. Use the -t cdlabelgen option to specify the new template-enc.ps file, or
       save the old template.ps and renmae template-enc.ps to template.ps.

</pre><h4><b>PRINTING</b></h4><pre>
       When using tools such as Adobe Acrobat to print the .ps or a .pdf file, make sure  that  "Fit  To  Paper"
       option  is  unchecked.   Also  uncheck  any option that will perform scaling up or down of the cdlabelgen
       output file.

       Failure to do so will result in incorrect size printouts.

       Paper Sizes: Normal CD cases, Slim CD cases, DVD inside inserts can be printed on a letter  or  A4  sized
       page.  CD/DVD Envelopes and DVD outside inserts will not fit on a letter sized paper, a larger paper size
       will be needed to make it fit.

       When    using    different   sized   paper,   experimentation   with   the   <b>-y</b>   (also:   <b>--page-offset</b>)
       [&lt;page_x_offset_inches,]&lt;page_y_offset_inches&gt; option may be required to place the image in the printable
       region of the paper.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
        ** Word wrap does not work well at all. It will clip lines, or it will
           auto-reduce the font size, both of which option look bad.

        ** Ability to change the text style on a given line:
           {#B}Track#  {#P}Title   {#I} Text...
           [Workaround available: just use multi columns input, use blank
            lines to spread out input items into columns]

        ** Ability to select or specify fonts for the text/items
