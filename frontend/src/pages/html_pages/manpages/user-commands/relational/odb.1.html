</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       odb - object-relational mapping (ORM) compiler for C++

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>odb</b> <b>[</b> <u>options</u> <b>]</b> <u>file</u> <b>[</b> <u>file...</u>  <b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Given  a  set  of C++ classes in a header file, <b>odb</b> generates C++ code that allows you to persist, query,
       and update objects of these classes in a relational database (RDBMS). The relational  database  that  the
       generated code should target is specified with the required <b>--database</b> option (see below).

       For  an  input  file  in  the  form  <b>name.hxx</b> (other file extensions can be used instead of <b>.hxx</b>), in the
       single-database mode (the default), the generated C++ files by default have the  following  names:  <b>name-</b>
       <b>odb.hxx</b>  (header  file), <b>name-odb.ixx</b> (inline file), and <b>name-odb.cxx</b> (source file). Additionally, if the
       <b>--generate-schema</b> option is specified and the <b>sql</b> schema format is requested (see  <b>--schema-format</b>),  the
       <b>name.sql</b>  database  schema  file  is  generated. If the <b>separate</b> schema format is requested, the database
       creation code is generated into the separate <b>name-schema.cxx</b> file.

       In the multi-database mode (see the <b>--multi-database</b> option below), the generated files corresponding  to
       the  <b>common</b>  database  have  the same names as in the single-database mode. For other databases, the file
       names include the database name:  <b>name-odb-</b><u>db</u><b>.hxx</b>,  <b>name-odb-</b><u>db</u><b>.ixx</b>,  <b>name-odb-</b><u>db</u><b>.cxx</b>,  <b>name-</b><u>db</u><b>.sql</b>,  and
       <b>name-schema-</b><u>db</u><b>.cxx</b> (where <u>db</u> is the database name).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b> Print usage information and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print version and exit.

       <b>-I</b> <u>dir</u> Add <u>dir</u> to the beginning of the list of directories to be searched for included header files.

       <b>-D</b> <u>name</u>[=<u>def</u>]
              Define macro <u>name</u> with definition <u>def</u>. If definition is omitted, define <u>name</u> to be 1.

       <b>-U</b> <u>name</u>
              Cancel any previous definitions of macro <u>name</u>, either built-in or provided with the <b>-D</b> option.

       <b>--database</b>|<b>-d</b> <u>db</u>
              Generate  code  for  the  <u>db</u>  database.  Valid values are <b>mssql</b>, <b>mysql</b>, <b>oracle</b>, <b>pgsql</b>, <b>sqlite</b>, and
              <b>common</b> (multi-database mode only).

       <b>--multi-database</b>|<b>-m</b> <u>type</u>
              Enable multi-database support and specify its type. Valid values for this option  are  <b>static</b>  and
              <b>dynamic</b>.

              In  the multi-database mode, options that determine the kind (for example, <b>--schema-format</b>), names
              (for example, <b>--odb-file-suffix</b>), or content (for example, prologue and epilogue options)  of  the
              output files can be prefixed with the database name followed by a colon, for example, <b>mysql:value</b>.
              This  restricts the value of such an option to only apply to generated files corresponding to this
              database.

       <b>--default-database</b> <u>db</u>
              When static multi-database support is used, specify the database that should be made the  default.
              When dynamic multi-database support is used, <b>common</b> is always made the default database.

       <b>--generate-query</b>|<b>-q</b>
              Generate  query  support code. Without this support you cannot use views and can only load objects
              via their ids.

       <b>--generate-prepared</b>
              Generate prepared query execution support code.

       <b>--omit-unprepared</b>
              Omit un-prepared (once-off) query execution support code.

       <b>--generate-session</b>|<b>-e</b>
              Generate session support code. With this option session support will be enabled by default for all
              the persistent classes except those for which it was explicitly  disabled  using  the  <b>db</b>  <b>session</b>
              pragma.

       <b>--generate-schema</b>|<b>-s</b>
              Generate  the  database  schema.  The database schema contains SQL statements that create database
              tables necessary to store persistent classes defined in the file  being  compiled.  Note  that  by
              applying this schema, all the existing information stored in such tables will be lost.

              Depending  on  the  database  being  used (<b>--database</b> option), the schema is generated either as a
              standalone SQL file or embedded into the generated C++ code. By default the SQL file is  generated
              for  the  MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server databases and the schema is embedded
              into the C++ code for the SQLite database. Use the <b>--schema-format</b> option  to  alter  the  default
              schema format.

              If  database schema evolution support is enabled (that is, the object model version is specified),
              then this option also triggers the generation  of  database  schema  migration  statements,  again
              either  as  standalong  SQL  files  or  embedded into the generated C++ code. You can suppress the
              generation of schema migration statements by specifying the <b>--suppress-migration</b> option.

       <b>--generate-schema-only</b>
              Generate only the database schema. Note that this option is only valid when generating schema as a
              standalone SQL file (see <b>--schema-format</b> for details).

       <b>--suppress-migration</b>
              Suppress the generation of database schema migration statements.

       <b>--suppress-schema-version</b>
              Suppress the generation of schema version table. If you specify this  option  then  you  are  also
              expected  to manually specify the database schema version and migration state at runtime using the
              <b>odb::database::schema_version()</b> function.

       <b>--schema-version-table</b> <u>name</u>
              Specify the alternative schema version table name instead of the default  <b>schema_version</b>.  If  you
              specify  this  option then you are also expected to manually specify the schema version table name
              at runtime using  the  <b>odb::database::schema_version_table()</b>  function.  The  table  name  can  be
              qualified.

       <b>--schema-format</b> <u>format</u>
              Generate  the database schema in the specified format. Pass <b>sql</b> as <u>format</u> to generate the database
              schema as a standalone SQL file or pass <b>embedded</b> to embed the schema into the generated C++  code.
              The  <b>separate</b>  value  is  similar  to <b>embedded</b> except the schema creation code is generated into a
              separate C++ file (<b>name-schema.cxx</b> by default). This value is primarily  useful  if  you  want  to
              place  the schema creation functionality into a separate program or library. Repeat this option to
              generate the same database schema in multiple formats.

       <b>--omit-drop</b>
              Omit <b>DROP</b> statements from the generated database schema.

       <b>--omit-create</b>
              Omit <b>CREATE</b> statements from the generated database schema.

       <b>--schema-name</b> <u>name</u>
              Use <u>name</u> as the database schema name. Schema names  are  primarily  used  to  distinguish  between
              multiple  embedded  schemas  in  the  schema  catalog.   They are not to be confused with database
              schemas (database namespaces) which are specified with the <b>--schema</b> option. If this option is  not
              specified, the empty name, which is the default schema name, is used.

       <b>--fkeys-deferrable-mode</b> <u>m</u>
              Use  constraint  checking  mode <u>m</u> in foreign keys generated for object relationships. Valid values
              for this option are <b>not_deferrable</b>, <b>immediate</b>, and <b>deferred</b> (default). MySQL and SQL Server do not
              support deferrable foreign keys and for these databases such keys  are  generated  commented  out.
              Other  foreign keys generated by the ODB compiler (such as the ones used to support containers and
              polymorphic hierarchies) are always generated as not deferrable.

              Note also that if you use either <b>not_deferrable</b> or <b>immediate</b> mode, then the  order  in  which  you
              persist, update, and erase objects within a transaction becomes important.

       <b>--default-pointer</b> <u>ptr</u>
              Use  <u>ptr</u>  as  the default pointer for persistent objects and views.  Objects and views that do not
              have a pointer assigned with the <b>db</b> <b>pointer</b> pragma will use this pointer by default. The value  of
              this  option  can  be  <b>*</b>  which denotes the raw pointer and is the default, or qualified name of a
              smart pointer class template, for example, <b>std::auto_ptr</b>. In the latter  case,  the  ODB  compiler
              constructs  the  object or view pointer by adding a single template argument of the object or view
              type to the qualified name, for example <b>std::auto_ptr&lt;object&gt;</b>.  The ODB runtime  uses  object  and
              view  pointers  to return, and, in case of objects, pass and cache dynamically allocated instances
              of object and view types.

              Except for the raw pointer and the standard smart pointers defined in the  <b>&lt;memory&gt;</b>  header  file,
              you  are  expected  to  include  the  definition  of  the  default pointer at the beginning of the
              generated header file. There are two common ways to achieve  this:  you  can  either  include  the
              necessary  header  in  the file being compiled or you can use the <b>--hxx-prologue</b> option to add the
              necessary <b>#include</b> directive to the generated code.

       <b>--session-type</b> <u>type</u>
              Use <u>type</u> as the alternative session type instead of the default <b>odb::session</b>. This option  can  be
              used to specify a custom session implementation to be use by the persistent classes. Note that you
              will  also  need  to  include  the definition of the custom session type into the generated header
              file. This is normally achieved with the <b>--hxx-prologue*</b> options.

       <b>--profile</b>|<b>-p</b> <u>name</u>
              Specify a profile that should be used during compilation. A profile is an options  file.  The  ODB
              compiler  first  looks  for a database-specific version with the name constructed by appending the
              <b>-</b><u>database</u><b>.options</b> suffix to <u>name</u>, where <u>database</u> is  the  database  name  as  specified  with  the
              <b>--database</b>  option.  If  this  file  is  not  found,  then  the ODB compiler looks for a database-
              independant version with the name constructed by appending just the <b>.options</b> suffix.

              The profile options files are searched for in the same set of directories as C++ headers  included
              with  the  <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;...&gt;</b> directive (built-in paths plus those specified with the <b>-I</b> options). The
              options file is first searched for in the directory itself and then in its <b>odb/</b> subdirectory.

              For the format of the options file refer to the <b>--options-file</b> option below. You can  repeat  this
              option to specify more than one profile.

       <b>--at-once</b>
              Generate  code for all the input files as well as for all the files that they include at once. The
              result is a single set of source/schema files that contain all the generated code.  If  more  than
              one  input  file is specified together with this option, then the <b>--input-name</b> option must also be
              specified in order to provide the base name for the output files. In this case, the directory part
              of such a base name is used as the location of the combined file. This can be  important  for  the
              <b>#include</b> directive resolution.

       <b>--schema</b> <u>schema</u>
              Specify  a  database schema (database namespace) that should be assigned to the persistent classes
              in the file being compiled. Database schemas are not to be confused  with  database  schema  names
              (schema catalog names) which are specified with the <b>--schema-name</b> option.

       <b>--export-symbol</b> <u>symbol</u>
              Insert     <u>symbol</u>     in     places     where     DLL     export/import     control     statements
              (<b>__declspec(dllexport/dllimport)</b>) are necessary. See also the <b>--extern-symbol</b> option below.

       <b>--extern-symbol</b> <u>symbol</u>
              If <u>symbol</u> is defined, insert it in places where a template instantiation must be declared  <b>extern</b>.
              This  option  is  normally used together with <b>--export-symbol</b> when both multi-database support and
              queries are enabled.

       <b>--std</b> <u>version</u>
              Specify the C++ standard that should be used during compilation. Valid values are <b>c++98</b> (default),
              <b>c++11</b>, and <b>c++14</b>.

       <b>--warn-hard-add</b>
              Warn about hard-added data members.

       <b>--warn-hard-delete</b>
              Warn about hard-deleted data members and persistent classes.

       <b>--warn-hard</b>
              Warn about both hard-added and hard-deleted data members and persistent classes.

       <b>--output-dir</b>|<b>-o</b> <u>dir</u>
              Write the generated files to <u>dir</u> instead of the current directory.

       <b>--input-name</b> <u>name</u>
              Use <u>name</u> instead of the input file to derive the names of the generated files.  If  the  <b>--at-once</b>
              option is specified, then the directory part of <u>name</u> is used as the location of the combined file.
              Refer to the <b>--at-once</b> option for details.

       <b>--changelog</b> <u>file</u>
              Read/write  changelog  from/to  <u>file</u>  instead of the default changelog file. The default changelog
              file name is derived from the input file name and it is placed into  the  same  directory  as  the
              input  file.  Note  that  the  <b>--output-dir</b> option does not affect the changelog file location. In
              other words, by default, the changelog file is treated as another input rather  than  output  even
              though  the  ODB  compiler  may  modify  it. Use the <b>--changelog-in</b> and <b>--changelog-out</b> options to
              specify different input and output chaneglog files.

       <b>--changelog-in</b> <u>file</u>
              Read changelog from <u>file</u> instead of the default changelog file. If this option is specified,  then
              you must also specify the output chanegelog file with <b>--changelog-out</b>.

       <b>--changelog-out</b> <u>file</u>
              Write  changelog  to <u>file</u> instead of the default changelog file. If this option is specified, then
              you must also specify the input chanegelog file with <b>--changelog-in</b>.

       <b>--changelog-dir</b> <u>dir</u>
              Use <u>dir</u> instead of the input file directory as the changelog file  directory.  This  directory  is
              also  added  to changelog files specified with the <b>--changelog</b>, <b>--changelog-in</b>, and <b>--changelog-in</b>
              options unless they are absolute paths.

       <b>--init-changelog</b>
              Force re-initialization of the changelog even if one exists (all the existing change history  will
              be lost). This option is primarily useful for automated testing.

       <b>--odb-file-suffix</b> <u>suffix</u>
              Use  <u>suffix</u>  to  construct  the  names of the generated C++ files. In the single-database mode the
              default value for this option is <b>-odb</b>. In the  multi-database  mode  it  is  <b>-odb</b>  for  the  files
              corresponding  to  the  <b>common</b>  database  and  <b>-odb-</b><u>db</u>  (where  <u>db</u> is the database name) for other
              databases.

       <b>--sql-file-suffix</b> <u>suffix</u>
              Use <u>suffix</u> to construct the name of the generated schema SQL file. In the single-database mode  by
              default  no  suffix  is  used. In the multi-database mode the default value for this option is <b>-</b><u>db</u>
              (where <u>db</u> is the database name).

       <b>--schema-file-suffix</b> <u>suffix</u>
              Use <u>suffix</u> to construct the name of the generated schema C++ source file. In  the  single-database
              mode  the  default  value  for this option is <b>-schema</b>. In the multi-database mode it is <b>-schema-</b><u>db</u>
              (where <u>db</u> is the database name). See the <b>--schema-format</b> option for details.

       <b>--changelog-file-suffix</b> <u>sfx</u>
              Use <u>sfx</u> to construct the name of the changelog file. In the single-database  mode  by  default  no
              suffix  is  used. In the multi-database mode the default value for this option is <b>-</b><u>db</u> (where <u>db</u> is
              the database name).

       <b>--hxx-suffix</b> <u>suffix</u>
              Use <u>suffix</u> instead of the default <b>.hxx</b> to construct the name of the generated C++ header file.

       <b>--ixx-suffix</b> <u>suffix</u>
              Use <u>suffix</u> instead of the default <b>.ixx</b> to construct the name of the generated C++ inline file.

       <b>--cxx-suffix</b> <u>suffix</u>
              Use <u>suffix</u> instead of the default <b>.cxx</b> to construct the name of the generated C++ source file.

       <b>--sql-suffix</b> <u>suffix</u>
              Use <u>suffix</u> instead of the default <b>.sql</b> to construct the name  of  the  generated  database  schema
              file.

       <b>--changelog-suffix</b> <u>suffix</u>
              Use <u>suffix</u> instead of the default <b>.xml</b> to construct the name of the changelog file.

       <b>--hxx-prologue</b> <u>text</u>
              Insert <u>text</u> at the beginning of the generated C++ header file.

       <b>--ixx-prologue</b> <u>text</u>
              Insert <u>text</u> at the beginning of the generated C++ inline file.

       <b>--cxx-prologue</b> <u>text</u>
              Insert <u>text</u> at the beginning of the generated C++ source file.

       <b>--schema-prologue</b> <u>text</u>
              Insert <u>text</u> at the beginning of the generated schema C++ source file.

       <b>--sql-prologue</b> <u>text</u>
              Insert <u>text</u> at the beginning of the generated database schema file.

       <b>--migration-prologue</b> <u>text</u>
              Insert <u>text</u> at the beginning of the generated database migration file.

       <b>--sql-interlude</b> <u>text</u>
              Insert  <u>text</u>  after all the <b>DROP</b> and before any <b>CREATE</b> statements in the generated database schema
              file.

       <b>--hxx-epilogue</b> <u>text</u>
              Insert <u>text</u> at the end of the generated C++ header file.

       <b>--ixx-epilogue</b> <u>text</u>
              Insert <u>text</u> at the end of the generated C++ inline file.

       <b>--cxx-epilogue</b> <u>text</u>
              Insert <u>text</u> at the end of the generated C++ source file.

       <b>--schema-epilogue</b> <u>text</u>
              Insert <u>text</u> at the end of the generated schema C++ source file.

       <b>--sql-epilogue</b> <u>text</u>
              Insert <u>text</u> at the end of the generated database schema file.

       <b>--migration-epilogue</b> <u>text</u>
              Insert <u>text</u> at the end of the generated database migration file.

       <b>--hxx-prologue-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Insert the content of <u>file</u> at the beginning of the generated C++ header file.

       <b>--ixx-prologue-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Insert the content of <u>file</u> at the beginning of the generated C++ inline file.

       <b>--cxx-prologue-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Insert the content of <u>file</u> at the beginning of the generated C++ source file.

       <b>--schema-prologue-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Insert the content of <u>file</u> at the beginning of the generated schema C++ source file.

       <b>--sql-prologue-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Insert the content of <u>file</u> at the beginning of the generated database schema file.

       <b>--migration-prologue-file</b> <u>f</u>
              Insert the content of file <u>f</u> at the beginning of the generated database migration file.

       <b>--sql-interlude-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Insert the content of <u>file</u> after all the <b>DROP</b> and before any <b>CREATE</b> statements  in  the  generated
              database schema file.

       <b>--hxx-epilogue-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Insert the content of <u>file</u> at the end of the generated C++ header file.

              Insert the content of <u>file</u> at the end of the generated C++ source file.

       <b>--schema-epilogue-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Insert the content of <u>file</u> at the end of the generated schema C++ source file.

       <b>--sql-epilogue-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Insert the content of <u>file</u> at the end of the generated database schema file.

       <b>--migration-epilogue-file</b> <u>f</u>
              Insert the content of file <u>f</u> at the end of the generated database migration file.

       <b>--odb-prologue</b> <u>text</u>
              Compile  <u>text</u> before the input header file. This option allows you to add additional declarations,
              such as custom traits specializations, to the ODB compilation process.

       <b>--odb-prologue-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Compile <u>file</u> contents before the input header file. Prologue files  are  compiled  after  all  the
              prologue text fragments (<b>--odb-prologue</b> option).

       <b>--odb-epilogue</b> <u>text</u>
              Compile  <u>text</u>  after the input header file. This option allows you to add additional declarations,
              such as custom traits specializations, to the ODB compilation process.

       <b>--odb-epilogue-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Compile <u>file</u> contents after the input header file. Epilogue  files  are  compiled  after  all  the
              epilogue text fragments (<b>--odb-epilogue</b> option).

       <b>--table-prefix</b> <u>prefix</u>
              Add  <u>prefix</u>  to table names and, for databases that have global index and/or foreign key names, to
              those names as well. The prefix is added to both names that were specified with the <b>db</b>  <b>table</b>  and
              <b>db</b>  <b>index</b>  pragmas  and those that were automatically derived from class and data member names. If
              you require a separator, such as an underscore, between the prefix and the name, then  you  should
              include it into the prefix value.

       <b>--index-suffix</b> <u>suffix</u>
              Use  <u>suffix</u> instead of the default <b>_i</b> to construct index names.  The suffix is only added to names
              that were automatically derived from data member names. If you require a  separator,  such  as  an
              underscore, between the name and the suffix, then you should include it into the suffix value.

       <b>--fkey-suffix</b> <u>suffix</u>
              Use  <u>suffix</u> instead of the default <b>_fk</b> to construct foreign key names. If you require a separator,
              such as an underscore, between the name and the suffix, then you should include it into the suffix
              value.

       <b>--sequence-suffix</b> <u>suffix</u>
              Use <u>suffix</u> instead of the default <b>_seq</b> to construct sequence names. If you  require  a  separator,
              such as an underscore, between the name and the suffix, then you should include it into the suffix
              value.

       <b>--sql-name-case</b> <u>case</u>
              Convert  all  automatically-derived SQL names to upper or lower case. Valid values for this option
              are  <b>upper</b> and <b>lower</b>.

       <b>--table-regex</b> <u>regex</u>
              Add <u>regex</u> to the list of regular expressions that is used to transform automatically-derived table

       <b>--accessor-regex</b> <u>regex</u>
              Add <u>regex</u> to the list of regular expressions used to transform data member names to function names
              when searching for a suitable accessor function. The  argument  to  this  option  is  a  Perl-like
              regular  expression  in  the  form <b>/</b><u>pattern</u><b>/</b><u>replacement</u><b>/</b>. Any character can be used as a delimiter
              instead of <b>/</b> and the delimiter can be escaped inside <u>pattern</u> and <u>replacement</u> with a backslash (<b>\</b>).
              You can specify multiple regular expressions by repeating this option.

              All the regular expressions are tried in  the  order  specified  and  the  first  expression  that
              produces  a  suitable  accessor  function  is used. Each expression is tried twice: first with the
              actual member name and then with the member's <u>public</u> <u>name</u> which is obtained by removing the common
              member name decorations, such as leading and trailing underscores, the <b>m_</b>  prefix,  etc.  The  ODB
              compiler  also includes a number of built-in expressions for commonly used accessor names, such as
              <b>get_foo</b>, <b>getFoo</b>, <b>getfoo</b>, and just <b>foo</b>. The built-in expressions are tried last.

              As an example, the following expression transforms data members with public names in the form  <b>foo</b>
              to accessor names in the form <b>GetFoo</b>:

       <b>--show-sloc</b>
              Print the number of generated physical source lines of code (SLOC).

       <b>--sloc-limit</b> <u>num</u>
              Check that the number of generated physical source lines of code (SLOC) does not exceed <u>num</u>.

       <b>--options-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Read  additional  options  from  <u>file</u>  with  each  option  appearing on a separate line optionally
              followed by space and an option value. Empty lines and lines starting with <b>#</b> are  ignored.  Option
              values  can  be  enclosed  in  double  (<b>"</b>)  or single (<b>'</b>) quotes  to preserve leading and trailing
              whitespaces as well as to specify empty values. If the value itself contains trailing  or  leading
              quotes,  enclose  it with an extra pair of quotes, for example <b>'"x"'</b>. Non-leading and non-trailing
              quotes are interpreted as being part of the option value.

              The semantics of providing options in a file is equivalent to providing the same set of options in
              the same order on the command line at the point  where  the  <b>--options-file</b>  option  is  specified
              except  that the shell escaping and quoting is not required. You can repeat this option to specify
              more than one options file.

       <b>-x</b> <u>option</u>
              Pass <u>option</u> to the underlying C++ compiler (<b>g++</b>). The <u>option</u> value that doesn't start  with  <b>-</b>  is
              considered the <b>g++</b> executable name.

       <b>-v</b>     Print the commands executed to run the stages of compilation.

       <b>--trace</b>
              Trace the compilation process.

       <b>--mysql-engine</b> <u>engine</u>
              Use  <u>engine</u>  instead  of  the  default  <b>InnoDB</b>  in  the  generated  database schema file. For more
              information on the storage engine options see the MySQL documentation. If you would  like  to  use
              the database-default engine, pass <b>default</b> as the value for this option.

       <b>--sqlite-override-null</b>
              Make  all columns in the generated database schema allow <b>NULL</b> values.  This is primarily useful in
              schema migration since SQLite does not support dropping of columns. By making all columns <b>NULL</b>  we
              can  later "delete" them by setting their values to <b>NULL</b>. Note that this option overrides even the
              <b>not_null</b> pragma.

       <b>--sqlite-lax-auto-id</b>
              Do not force  monotonically  increasing  automatically-assigned  object  ids.  In  this  mode  the
              generated  database  schema  omits  the  <b>AUTOINCREMENT</b>  keyword  which  results  in  faster object
              persistence but may lead to automatically-assigned ids not being in a  strictly  ascending  order.
              Refer to the SQLite documentation for details.

       <b>--pgsql-server-version</b> <u>ver</u>
              Specify the minimum PostgreSQL server version with which the generated C++ code and schema will be
              used.  This  information  is  used to enable version-specific optimizations and workarounds in the
              generated C++ code and schema. The version must be in the <u>major</u><b>.</b><u>minor</u> form, for example,  <b>9.1</b>.  If
              this option is not specified, then <b>7.4</b> or later is assumed.

       <b>--oracle-client-version</b> <u>ver</u>
              Specify  the minimum Oracle client library (OCI) version with which the generated C++ code will be
              linked. This information is used to enable version-specific optimizations and workarounds  in  the
              generated  C++  code.   The  version  must  be in the <u>major</u><b>.</b><u>minor</u> form, for example, <b>11.2</b>. If this
              option is not specified, then <b>10.1</b> or later is assumed.

       <b>--oracle-warn-truncation</b>
              Warn about SQL names that are longer than 30 characters and are  therefore  truncated.  Note  that
              during  database  schema  generation (<b>--generate-schema</b>) ODB detects when such truncations lead to
              name conflicts and issues diagnostics even without this option specified.

       <b>--mssql-server-version</b> <u>ver</u>
              Specify the minimum SQL Server server version with which the generated C++ code and schema will be
              used. This information is used to enable version-specific optimizations  and  workarounds  in  the
              generated  C++ code and schema. The version must be in the <u>major</u><b>.</b><u>minor</u> form, for example, <b>9.0</b> (SQL
              Server 2005), <b>10.5</b> (2008R2), or <b>11.0</b> (2012). If this option  is  not  specified,  then  <b>10.0</b>  (SQL
              Server 2008) or later is assumed.

       <b>--mssql-short-limit</b> <u>size</u>
              Specify  the  short data size limit. If a character, national character, or binary data type has a
              maximum length (in bytes) less than or equal to this limit, then it  is  treated  as  <u>short</u>  <u>data</u>,
              otherwise  it is <u>long</u> <u>data</u>. For short data ODB pre-allocates an intermediate buffer of the maximum
              size and binds it directly to a parameter or result column. This way the underlying API (ODBC) can
              read/write directly from/to this buffer.  In the case of long data, the data  is  read/written  in
              chunks  using  the  <b>SQLGetData()</b>/<b>SQLPutData()</b> ODBC functions. While the long data approach reduces
              the amount of memory used by the application, it may require greater CPU  resources.  The  default
              short  data  limit  is  1024  bytes.  When setting a custom short data limit, make sure that it is
              sufficiently large so that no object id in the application is treated as long data.

</pre><h4><b>SQL</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>TRANSFORMATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The ODB compiler provides a number of mechanisms for transforming automatically-derived SQL  names,  such
       as tables, columns, etc., to match a specific naming convention. At the higher level, we can add a prefix
       to  global  names  (tables  and, for some databases, indexes and/or foreign keys) with the <b>--table-prefix</b>
       option. Similarly, we can  specify  custom  suffixes  for  automatically-derived  index  (<b>--index-suffix</b>;
       default  is <b>_i</b>), foreign key (<b>--fkey-suffix</b>; default is <b>_fk</b>), and sequence (<b>--sequence-suffix</b>; default is
       <b>_seq</b>) names. Finally, we can also convert all the names to upper or lower case with  the  <b>--sql-name-case</b>
       option (valid values are <b>upper</b> and <b>lower</b>).

       At  the lower level we can specify a set of regular expressions to implement arbitrary transformations of
       the automatically-derived SQL names. If we want a particular  regular  expression  only  to  apply  to  a
       specific  name, for example, table or column, then we use one of the <b>--</b><u>kind</u><b>-regex</b> options, where <u>kind</u> can
       be <b>table</b>, <b>column</b>, <b>index</b>, <b>fkey</b>, <b>sequence</b>, or <b>statement</b>.  On  the  other  hand,  if  we  want  our  regular
       expressions to apply to all SQL names, then we use the <b>--sql-name-regex</b> option.

       The  interaction  between the higher and lower level transformations is as follows. Prefixes and suffixes
       are added first. Then the regular expression transformations are applied. Finally, if requested, the name
       is converted to upper or lower case. Note also that all of  these  transformations  except  for  <b>--table-</b>
       <b>prefix</b>  only  apply  to  automatically-derived  names. In other words, if a table, column, etc., name was
       explicitly specified with a pragma, then it is used as is, without applying any  (except  for  the  table
       prefix) transformations.

       The  value for the <b>--*-regex</b> options is a Perl-like regular expression in the form <b>/</b><u>pattern</u><b>/</b><u>replacement</u><b>/</b>.
       Any character can be used as a delimiter instead of <b>/</b> and the delimiter can be escaped inside <u>pattern</u> and
       <u>replacement</u> with a backslash (<b>\</b>).  You can also specify multiple regular expressions by  repeating  these
       options.

       All  the  regular  expressions  are  tried in the order specified with the name-specific expressions (for
       example, <b>--table-regex)</b> tried first followed by the generic expressions  (<b>--sql-name-regex</b>).   The  first
       expression that matches is used.

       As  an  example,  consider  a regular expression that transforms a class name in the form <b>CFoo</b> to a table
       name in the form <b>FOO:</b>

       <b>--table-regex</b> <b>'/C(.+)/\U$1/'</b>

       As a more interesting example, consider the transformation of class names that  follow  the  upper  camel
       case convention (for example, <b>FooBar</b>) to table names that follow the underscore-separated, all upper case
       convention (for example, <b>FOO_BAR</b>).  For this case we have to use separate expressions to handle one-word,
       two-word, etc., names:

       <b>--table-regex</b> <b>'/([A-z][a-z]+)/\U$1/'</b>

       <b>--table-regex</b> <b>'/([A-z][a-z]+)([A-z][a-z]+)/\U$1_$2/'</b>

       See also the REGEX AND SHELL QUOTING section below.

</pre><h4><b>REGEX</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SHELL</b> <b>QUOTING</b></h4><pre>
       When  entering  a  regular  expression  argument  in  the shell command line it is often necessary to use
       quoting (enclosing the argument in " " or ' ') in order to prevent the shell  from  interpreting  certain
       characters, for example, spaces as argument separators and $ as variable expansions.

       Unfortunately  it is hard to achieve this in a manner that is portable across POSIX shells, such as those
       found on GNU/Linux and UNIX, and Windows shell. For example, if you use " " for quoting you  will  get  a
       wrong  result  with  POSIX shells if your expression contains $. The standard way of dealing with this on
       POSIX systems is to use ' ' instead. Unfortunately, Windows shell does not remove  '  '   from  arguments
       when  they  are passed to applications. As a result you may have to use ' ' for POSIX and " " for Windows
       ($ is not treated as a special character on Windows).

       Alternatively, you can save regular expression options into a file, one option per  line,  and  use  this
       file with the <b>--options-file</b> option. With this approach you don't need to worry about shell quoting.
