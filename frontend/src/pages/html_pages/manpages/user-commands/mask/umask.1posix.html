</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       umask — get or set the file mode creation mask

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       umask <b>[</b>-S<b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>mask</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>umask</u>  utility shall set the file mode creation mask of the current shell execution environment (see
       <u>Section</u> <u>2.12</u>, <u>Shell</u> <u>Execution</u> <u>Environment</u>) to the value specified by the <u>mask</u> operand.  This  mask  shall
       affect the initial value of the file permission bits of subsequently created files. If <u>umask</u> is called in
       a subshell or separate utility execution environment, such as one of the following:

           (umask 002)
           nohup umask ...
           find . -exec umask ... \;

       it shall not affect the file mode creation mask of the caller's environment.

       If  the  <u>mask</u> operand is not specified, the <u>umask</u> utility shall write to standard output the value of the
       file mode creation mask of the invoking process.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>umask</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following option shall be supported:

       <b>-S</b>        Produce symbolic output.

       The  default  output style is unspecified, but shall be recognized on a subsequent invocation of <u>umask</u> on
       the same system as a <u>mask</u> operand to restore the previous file mode creation mask.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>mask</u>      A string specifying the new file mode creation mask. The string is treated in the same  way  as
                 the <u>mode</u> operand described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section for <u>chmod</u>.

                 For  a  <u>symbolic_mode</u>  value, the new value of the file mode creation mask shall be the logical
                 complement of the file permission bits portion of the file mode specified by the  <u>symbolic_mode</u>
                 string.

                 In  a  <u>symbolic_mode</u>  value,  the  permissions  <u>op</u>  characters <b>'+'</b> and <b>'-'</b> shall be interpreted
                 relative to the current file mode creation mask; <b>'+'</b> shall cause the  bits  for  the  indicated
                 permissions  to  be cleared in the mask; <b>'-'</b> shall cause the bits for the indicated permissions
                 to be set in the mask.

                 The interpretation of <u>mode</u> values that specify file mode bits other than  the  file  permission
                 bits is unspecified.

                 In the octal integer form of <u>mode</u>, the specified bits are set in the file mode creation mask.

                 The file mode creation mask shall be set to the resulting numeric value.

                 The default output of a prior invocation of <u>umask</u> on the same system with no operand also shall
                 be recognized as a <u>mask</u> operand.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>umask</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       When the <u>mask</u> operand is not specified, the <u>umask</u> utility shall write a message to standard  output  that
       can later be used as a <u>umask</u> <u>mask</u> operand.

       If <b>-S</b> is specified, the message shall be in the following format:

           "u=%s,g=%s,o=%s\n", &lt;<u>owner</u> <u>permissions</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>group</u> <u>permissions</u>&gt;,
               &lt;<u>other</u> <u>permissions</u>&gt;

       where  the three values shall be combinations of letters from the set {<u>r</u>, <u>w</u>, <u>x</u>}; the presence of a letter
       shall indicate that the corresponding bit is clear in the file mode creation mask.

       If a <u>mask</u> operand is specified, there shall be no output written to standard output.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The file mode creation mask was successfully changed, or no <u>mask</u> operand was supplied.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Since <u>umask</u> affects the current shell execution environment, it is generally provided as a shell  regular
       built-in.

       In contrast to the negative permission logic provided by the file mode creation mask and the octal number
       form  of  the  <u>mask</u> argument, the symbolic form of the <u>mask</u> argument specifies those permissions that are
       left alone.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Either of the commands:

           umask a=rx,ug+w

           umask 002

       sets the mode mask so that subsequently created files have their S_IWOTH bit cleared.

       After setting the mode mask with either of the above commands, the <u>umask</u> command can be used to write out
       the current value of the mode mask:

           <b>$</b> umask
           <b>0002</b>

       (The output format is unspecified, but historical implementations use the octal integer mode format.)

           <b>$</b> umask -S
           <b>u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx</b>

       Either of these outputs can be used as the mask operand to a subsequent invocation of the <u>umask</u> utility.

       Assuming the mode mask is set as above, the command:

           umask g-w

       sets the mode mask so that subsequently created files have their S_IWGRP and S_IWOTH bits cleared.

       The command:

           umask -- -w

       sets the mode mask so that subsequently created files have all their write bits cleared. Note  that  <u>mask</u>
       operands <b>-r</b>, <b>-w</b>, <b>-x</b> or anything beginning with a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;, must be preceded by <b>"--"</b> to keep it from
       being interpreted as an option.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Since  <u>umask</u> affects the current shell execution environment, it is generally provided as a shell regular
       built-in. If it is called in a subshell or separate utility execution environment, such  as  one  of  the
       following:

           (umask 002)
           nohup umask ...
           find . -exec umask ... \;

       it does not affect the file mode creation mask of the environment of the caller.

       The  description  of  the historical utility was modified to allow it to use the symbolic modes of <u>chmod</u>.
       The <b>-s</b> option used in early proposals was changed to <b>-S</b> because <b>-s</b> could be confused with a <u>symbolic_mode</u>
       form of mask referring to the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits.

       The default output style is unspecified to permit implementors to provide migration to the  new  symbolic
       style  at  the  time  most  appropriate  to their users. A <b>-o</b> flag to force octal mode output was omitted
       because the octal mode may not be sufficient to specify all of the information that may be present in the
       file mode creation mask when more secure file access permission checks are implemented.

       It has been suggested that trusted systems developers might appreciate ameliorating the requirement  that
       the  mode mask ``affects'' the file access permissions, since it seems access control lists might replace
       the mode mask to some degree. The wording has been changed to say that it  affects  the  file  permission
       bits,  and  it  leaves  the details of the behavior of how they affect the file access permissions to the
       description in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017.
