</pre><h4><b>KEYWORDS</b></h4><pre>
       general, GUI

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       GRASS  GIS functionality is organized into modules, which are standalone programs with defined interface.
       Their graphical user interface (GUI) is a dialog with several tabs which organize module parameters  into
       groups.

       Each  parameter can have different type of input fields, for example text entry or drop-down list.  Flags
       are represented as checkboxes. The parameter (or flag) name is visible on the right side  of  each  input
       field  so  that  it  is  simple to understand how the module dialog relates to the command representation
       which is used in the manuals and tutorials.  The commands can be used to call the module in  the  command
       line, Shell scripts or, with a slight modification, in a Python script.

   <b>Tabs</b>
       Module  parameters  and  flags  are  organized in tabs. Their names can depend on a module, however every
       module has <u>Command</u> <u>output</u> tab where the progress can be observed, and the module  output  including  text
       results  or  warnings  are  printed.  The last <u>Manual</u> tab contains description of module’s parameters and
       examples. The same information can be found in the online manual as well.

       The style of the tabs can be changed through <u>GUI</u> <u>settings</u> - <u>Appearance</u> - <u>Module</u> <u>dialog</u> <u>style</u>.  Note  that
       the  style  appearance  depends  on  the  platform  and  some styles might be more suitable for different
       platforms.
       Figure: Example of style "left" and "top" on Ubuntu.

   <b>Flags</b>
       Module flags are represented as checkboxes with description. There are three special flags  -  <u>overwrite</u>,
       <u>verbose</u>  and  <u>quiet</u>.   Flags <u>verbose</u> and <u>quiet</u> set the level of verbosity of the module (how detailed the
       messages should be).

       Modules which output a new map or a new file have  the  flag  <u>overwrite</u>  which  must  be  used  when  the
       specified  output map or file is already present.  If the map or file of the specified name already exist
       and <u>overwrite</u> flag is not used, an error message appears:
       r.slope.aspect elevation=elevation slope=slope
       ERROR: option &lt;slope&gt;: &lt;slope&gt; exists. To overwrite, use the --overwrite flag
       If using the command instead of GUI, these flags are unlike other flags prefixed with double dash:
       r.slope.aspect elevation=elevation slope=slope --overwrite --quiet

   <b>Current</b> <b>working</b> <b>directory</b>
       Certain modules require a file as input or output.  Either  the  full  path  to  the  file  needs  to  be
       specified or a path relative to the current working directory is enough, for example only the name of the
       file.  <b>Current</b> <b>working</b> <b>directory</b> is a directory where GRASS would look for or output files to if the full
       path  is  not specified.  By default working directory is user’s home folder.  It can be changed in wxGUI
       menu <u>Settings</u> - <u>GRASS</u> <u>working</u> <u>environment</u> - <u>Change</u> <u>working</u> <u>directory</u>, or by typing cd and pressing  Enter
       in  the  wxGUI Command console.  If the working directory is changed to a directory where the input files
       are, then it is enough to specify just the name of the file instead of the full path.

       This applies to external files such as text files or GeoTiff files.  This does not apply to raster  maps,
       vector  maps  and  other  geospatial  data  stored  in  GRASS  database  which do not need any path to be
       specified.

   <b>Special</b> <b>widgets</b>
       For raster, vector or 3D raster input, there is a special widget which after clicking on the arrow to the
       right pops up a list of existing maps from different mapsets.  Selecting a map from the popup  list  will
       add  it  to  the  entry  field.   In  case  multiple maps can be specified (denoted by <u>[multiple]</u> label),
       selecting a map from the popup list will append the map names with comma in between.

       If the input file is supposed to be a text file (for example color rules in r.colors), it is possible  to
       type the text in the provided box directly instead of creating a new file in a text editor and saving it.
       A  temporary file is created in this case. By pressing the <u>Save</u> <u>as</u> button, the content of the box is then
       saved into user specified file, so that user’s workflow can be reproduced later. With <u>Load</u> button we  can
       display the content of selected file and edit it directly in the box.

       Figure:  In the first image, user specified a full path to a file.  In the second image, user typed color
       rules conveniently into the box below, however the rules will not be stored permanently.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Dialogs are generated automatically based on module  interface  defined  using  g.parser.   Command  line
       interface  can be obtained when running the module with a <u>--help</u> flag. The options and flags are the same
       as in the module GUI.
       r.neighbors --help
       Description:
        Makes each cell category value a function of the category
       values assigned to the cells around it, and stores new cell
       values in an output raster map layer.
       Keywords:
        raster, algebra, statistics, aggregation, neighbor, focal
       statistics, filter
       Usage:
        r.neighbors [-ac] input=name [selection=name]
       output=name[,name,...]
          [method=string[,string,...]] [size=value] [title=phrase]
       [weight=name]
          [gauss=value] [quantile=value[,value,...]] [--overwrite]
       [--help]
          [--verbose] [--quiet] [--ui]
       Flags:
         -a   Do not align output with the input
         -c   Use circular neighborhood
        --o   Allow output files to overwrite existing files
        --h   Print usage summary
        --v   Verbose module output
        --q   Quiet module output

       cells which should be processed
