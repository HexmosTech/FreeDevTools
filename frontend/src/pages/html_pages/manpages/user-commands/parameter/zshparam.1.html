</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       zshparam - zsh parameters

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  parameter has a name, a value, and a number of attributes.  A name may be any sequence of alphanumeric
       characters and underscores, or the single characters `<b>*</b>', `<b>@</b>', `<b>#</b>', `<b>?</b>', `<b>-</b>', `<b>$</b>', or `<b>!</b>'.   A  parameter
       whose name begins with an alphanumeric or underscore is also referred to as a <u>variable</u>.

       The attributes of a parameter determine the <u>type</u> of its value, often referred to as the parameter type or
       variable  type, and also control other processing that may be applied to the value when it is referenced.
       The value type may be a <u>scalar</u> (a string, an integer, or a floating  point  number),  an  array  (indexed
       numerically),  or  an  <u>associative</u>  array  (an  unordered  set of name-value pairs, indexed by name, also
       referred to as a <u>hash</u>).

       Named scalar parameters may have the <u>exported</u>, <b>-x</b>, attribute, to copy them into the process  environment,
       which  is then passed from the shell to any new processes that it starts.  Exported parameters are called
       <u>environment</u> <u>variables</u>. The shell also <u>imports</u> environment variables at  startup  time  and  automatically
       marks  the corresponding parameters as exported.  Some environment variables are not imported for reasons
       of security or because they would interfere with the correct operation of other shell features.

       Parameters may also be <u>special</u>, that is, they  have  a  predetermined  meaning  to  the  shell.   Special
       parameters  cannot  have  their  type  changed  or  their readonly attribute turned off, and if a special
       parameter is unset, then later recreated, the special properties will be retained.

       To declare the type of a parameter, or to assign a string or numeric value to a scalar parameter, use the
       <b>typeset</b> builtin.

       The value of a scalar parameter may also be assigned by writing:

              <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>

       In scalar assignment, <u>value</u> is expanded as a single string, in which the elements of  arrays  are  joined
       together; filename expansion is not performed unless the option <b>GLOB_ASSIGN</b> is set.

       When  the  integer  attribute, <b>-i</b>, or a floating point attribute, <b>-E</b> or <b>-F</b>, is set for <u>name</u>, the <u>value</u> is
       subject to arithmetic  evaluation.   Furthermore,  by  replacing  `<b>=</b>'  with  `<b>+=</b>',  a  parameter  can  be
       incremented or appended to.  See the section `Array Parameters' and <u>Arithmetic</u> <u>Evaluation</u> (in <u><a href="../man1/zshmisc.1.html">zshmisc</a></u>(1))
       for additional forms of assignment.

       Note  that  assignment  may  implicitly  change  the attributes of a parameter.  For example, assigning a
       number to a variable in arithmetic evaluation  may  change  its  type  to  integer  or  float,  and  with
       <b>GLOB_ASSIGN</b> assigning a pattern to a variable may change its type to an array.

       To reference the value of a parameter, write `<b>$</b><u>name</u>' or `<b>${</b><u>name</u><b>}</b>'.  See <u>Parameter</u> <u>Expansion</u> in <u><a href="../man1/zshexpn.1.html">zshexpn</a></u>(1)
       for  complete  details.  That section also explains the effect of the difference between scalar and array
       assignment on parameter expansion.

</pre><h4><b>ARRAY</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       To assign an array value, write one of:

              <b>set</b> <b>-A</b> <u>name</u> <u>value</u> ...
              <u>name</u><b>=(</b><u>value</u> ...<b>)</b>
              <u>name</u><b>=([</b><u>key</u><b>]=</b><u>value</u> ...<b>)</b>

       If no parameter <u>name</u> exists, an ordinary array parameter is created.  If the parameter <u>name</u> exists and is
       a scalar, it is replaced by a new array.

       In the third form, <u>key</u> is an expression that will be evaluated in arithmetic  context  (in  its  simplest
       form,  an  integer)  that  gives  the  index  of the element to be assigned with <u>value</u>.  In this form any
       elements not explicitly mentioned that come before the largest index to which a  value  is  assigned  are
       assigned  an  empty  string.  The indices may be in any order.  Note that this syntax is strict: <b>[</b> and <b>]=</b>
       must not be quoted, and <u>key</u> may not consist of the unquoted string <b>]=</b>, but  is  otherwise  treated  as  a
       simple  string.  The enhanced forms of subscript expression that may be used when directly subscripting a
       variable name, described in the section `Array Subscripts' below, are not available.

       The syntaxes with and without the explicit key may be mixed.  An implicit <u>key</u> is deduced by  incrementing
       the  index  from  the  previously  assigned  element.   Note that it is not treated as an error if latter
       assignments in this form overwrite earlier assignments.

       For example, assuming the option <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is not set, the following:

              <b>array=(one</b> <b>[3]=three</b> <b>four)</b>

       causes the array variable <b>array</b> to contain four elements <b>one</b>, an empty string, <b>three</b> and  <b>four</b>,  in  that
       order.

       In the forms where only <u>value</u> is specified, full command line expansion is performed.

       In  the <b>[</b><u>key</u><b>]=</b><u>value</u> form, both <u>key</u> and <u>value</u> undergo all forms of expansion allowed for single word shell
       expansions (this does not include filename generation); these are as performed by the parameter expansion
       flag <b>(e)</b> as described in <u><a href="../man1/zshexpn.1.html">zshexpn</a></u>(1).  Nested parentheses may surround <u>value</u> and are included as  part  of
       the  value, which is joined into a plain string; this differs from ksh which allows the values themselves
       to be arrays.  A future version of zsh may support that.  To cause the brackets to be  interpreted  as  a
       character  class  for filename generation, and therefore to treat the resulting list of files as a set of
       values, quote the equal sign using any form of quoting.  Example:

              <u>name</u><b>=([a-z]'='*)</b>

       To append to an array without changing the existing values, use one of the following:

              <u>name</u><b>+=(</b><u>value</u> ...<b>)</b>
              <u>name</u><b>+=([</b><u>key</u><b>]=</b><u>value</u> ...<b>)</b>

       In the second form <u>key</u> may specify an existing index as well as an index off the end of  the  old  array;
       any  existing  value  is overwritten by <u>value</u>.  Also, it is possible to use <b>[</b><u>key</u><b>]+=</b><u>value</u> to append to the
       existing value at that index.

       Within the parentheses on the right hand side of either form of the assignment, newlines  and  semicolons
       are  treated  the  same  as  white space, separating individual <u>value</u>s.  Any consecutive sequence of such
       characters has the same effect.

       Ordinary array parameters may also be explicitly declared with:

              <b>typeset</b> <b>-a</b> <u>name</u>

       Associative arrays <u>must</u> be declared before assignment, by using:

              <b>typeset</b> <b>-A</b> <u>name</u>

       When <u>name</u> refers to an associative array, the list in an assignment is interpreted  as  alternating  keys
       and values:

              <b>set</b> <b>-A</b> <u>name</u> <u>key</u> <u>value</u> ...
              <u>name</u><b>=(</b><u>key</u> <u>value</u> ...<b>)</b>
              <u>name</u><b>=([</b><u>key</u><b>]=</b><u>value</u> ...<b>)</b>

       Note  that  only  one of the two syntaxes above may be used in any given assignment; the forms may not be
       mixed.  This is unlike the case of numerically indexed arrays.

       Every <u>key</u> must have a <u>value</u> in this case.  Note that this assigns  to  the  entire  array,  deleting  any
       elements that do not appear in the list.  The append syntax may also be used with an associative array:

              <u>name</u><b>+=(</b><u>key</u> <u>value</u> ...<b>)</b>
              <u>name</u><b>+=([</b><u>key</u><b>]=</b><u>value</u> ...<b>)</b>

       This adds a new key/value pair if the key is not already present, and replaces the value for the existing
       key if it is.  In the second form it is also possible to use <b>[</b><u>key</u><b>]+=</b><u>value</u> to append to the existing value
       at  that  key.   Expansion  is  performed  identically  to  the corresponding forms for normal arrays, as
       described above.

       To create an empty array (including associative arrays), use one of:

              <b>set</b> <b>-A</b> <u>name</u>
              <u>name</u><b>=()</b>

   <b>Array</b> <b>Subscripts</b>
       Individual elements of an array may be selected using a subscript.   A  subscript  of  the  form  `<b>[</b><u>exp</u><b>]</b>'
       selects the single element <u>exp</u>, where <u>exp</u> is an arithmetic expression which will be subject to arithmetic
       expansion as if it were surrounded by `<b>$((</b>...<b>))</b>'.  The elements are numbered beginning with 1, unless the
       <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> option is set in which case they are numbered from zero.

       Subscripts  may be used inside braces used to delimit a parameter name, thus `<b>${foo[2]}</b>' is equivalent to
       `<b>$foo[2]</b>'.  If the <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> option is set, the braced form is the only one  that  works,  as  bracketed
       expressions otherwise are not treated as subscripts.

       If  the  <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> option is not set, then by default accesses to an array element with a subscript that
       evaluates to zero return an empty string, while an attempt to write such an  element  is  treated  as  an
       error.   For  backward compatibility the <b>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT</b> option can be set to cause subscript values 0
       and 1 to be equivalent; see the description of the option in <u><a href="../man1/zshoptions.1.html">zshoptions</a></u>(1).

       The same subscripting syntax is used for associative arrays,  except  that  no  arithmetic  expansion  is
       applied to <u>exp</u>.  However, the parsing rules for arithmetic expressions still apply, which affects the way
       that  certain  special characters must be protected from interpretation.  See <u>Subscript</u> <u>Parsing</u> below for
       details.

       A subscript of the form `<b>[*]</b>' or `<b>[@]</b>' evaluates to all elements of an  array;  there  is  no  difference
       between the two except when they appear within double quotes.  `<b>"$foo[*]"</b>' evaluates to `<b>"$foo[1]</b> <b>$foo[2]</b>
       ...<b>"</b>',  whereas  `<b>"$foo[@]"</b>'  evaluates  to  `<b>"$foo[1]"</b> <b>"$foo[2]"</b> ...'.  For associative arrays, `<b>[*]</b>' or
       `<b>[@]</b>' evaluate to all the values, in no particular order.  Note that this does not substitute  the  keys;
       see  the  documentation  for  the  `<b>k</b>'  flag  under  <u>Parameter</u> <u>Expansion</u> <u>Flags</u> in <u><a href="../man1/zshexpn.1.html">zshexpn</a></u>(1) for complete
       details.  When an array  parameter  is  referenced  as  `<b>$</b><u>name</u>'  (with  no  subscript)  it  evaluates  to
       `<b>$</b><u>name</u><b>[*]</b>',  unless  the  <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b>  option  is  set  in which case it evaluates to `<b>${</b><u>name</u><b>[0]}</b>' (for an
       associative array, this means the value of the key `<b>0</b>', which may not exist even if there are values  for
       other keys).

       A  subscript  of  the  form  `<b>[</b><u>exp1</u><b>,</b><u>exp2</u><b>]</b>'  selects  all  elements  in the range <u>exp1</u> to <u>exp2</u>, inclusive.
       (Associative arrays are unordered, and so do not support ranges.) If one of the subscripts evaluates to a
       negative number, say <b>-</b><u>n</u>, then the <u>n</u>th element from the end of the array is used.  Thus `<b>$foo[-3]</b>' is  the
       third element from the end of the array <b>foo</b>, and `<b>$foo[1,-1]</b>' is the same as `<b>$foo[*]</b>'.

       Subscripting  may also be performed on non-array values, in which case the subscripts specify a substring
       to be extracted.  For example, if <b>FOO</b> is set to `<b>foobar</b>', then `<b>echo</b> <b>$FOO[2,5]</b>' prints `<b>ooba</b>'.  Note that
       some forms of subscripting described below perform pattern matching,  and  in  that  case  the  substring
       extends  from  the  start  of  the  match  of  the  first subscript to the end of the match of the second
       subscript.  For example,

              <b>string="abcdefghijklm"</b>
              <b>print</b> <b>${string[(r)d?,(r)h?]}</b>

       prints `<b>defghi</b>'.  This is an obvious generalisation of the rule  for  single-character  matches.   For  a
       single  subscript,  only  a  single  character  is referenced (not the range of characters covered by the
       match).

       Note that in substring operations the second subscript is handled differently by the <b>r</b>  and  <b>R</b>  subscript
       flags:  the former takes the shortest match as the length and the latter the longest match.  Hence in the
       former case a <b>*</b> at the end is redundant while in the latter case it matches the whole  remainder  of  the
       string.   This does not affect the result of the single subscript case as here the length of the match is
       irrelevant.

   <b>Array</b> <b>Element</b> <b>Assignment</b>
       A subscript may be used on the left side of an assignment like so:

              <u>name</u><b>[</b><u>exp</u><b>]=</b><u>value</u>

       In this form of assignment the element or range specified by <u>exp</u> is replaced by  the  expression  on  the
       right  side.  An array (but not an associative array) may be created by assignment to a range or element.
       Arrays do not nest, so assigning a parenthesized list of values to an element or range changes the number
       of elements in the array, shifting the other elements to  accommodate  the  new  values.   (This  is  not
       supported for associative arrays.)

       This syntax also works as an argument to the <b>typeset</b> command:

              <b>typeset</b> <b>"</b><u>name</u><b>[</b><u>exp</u><b>]"=</b><u>value</u>

       The  <u>value</u> may <u>not</u> be a parenthesized list in this case; only single-element assignments may be made with
       <b>typeset</b>.  Note that quotes are necessary in this case to prevent the brackets from being  interpreted  as
       filename generation operators.  The <b>noglob</b> precommand modifier could be used instead.

       To  delete  an  element  of  an  ordinary array, assign `<b>()</b>' to that element.  To delete an element of an
       associative array, use the <b>unset</b> command:

              <b>unset</b> <b>"</b><u>name</u><b>[</b><u>exp</u><b>]"</b>

   <b>Subscript</b> <b>Flags</b>
       If the opening bracket, or the comma in a range, in any subscript expression is directly followed  by  an
       opening parenthesis, the string up to the matching closing one is considered to be a list of flags, as in
       `<u>name</u><b>[(</b><u>flags</u><b>)</b><u>exp</u><b>]</b>'.

       The  flags  <b>s</b>,  <b>n</b>  and <b>b</b> take an argument; the delimiter is shown below as `<b>:</b>', but any character, or the
       matching pairs `<b>(</b>...<b>)</b>', `<b>{</b>...<b>}</b>', `<b>[</b>...<b>]</b>', or `<b>&lt;</b>...<b>&gt;</b>', may be used, but note that `<b>&lt;</b>...<b>&gt;</b>' can only be used
       if the subscript is inside a double quoted expression or a parameter substitution enclosed in  braces  as
       otherwise the expression is interpreted as a redirection.

       The flags currently understood are:

       <b>w</b>      If  the  parameter subscripted is a scalar then this flag makes subscripting work on words instead
              of characters.  The default word separator is whitespace.  When combined with the <b>i</b> or <b>I</b> flag, the
              effect is to produce the index of the first character of the first/last  word  which  matches  the
              given pattern; note that a failed match in this case always yields 0.

       <b>s:</b><u>string</u><b>:</b>
              This  gives  the <u>string</u> that separates words (for use with the <b>w</b> flag).  The delimiter character <b>:</b>
              is arbitrary; see above.

       <b>p</b>      Recognize the same escape sequences as the <b>print</b> builtin in the string argument  of  a  subsequent
              `<b>s</b>' flag.

       <b>f</b>      If  the  parameter subscripted is a scalar then this flag makes subscripting work on lines instead
              of characters, i.e. with elements separated by newlines.  This is a shorthand for `<b>pws:\n:</b>'.

       <b>r</b>      Reverse subscripting: if this flag is given, the <u>exp</u> is taken as a pattern and the result  is  the
              first  matching array element, substring or word (if the parameter is an array, if it is a scalar,
              or if it is a scalar and the `<b>w</b>' flag is given, respectively).  The subscript used is  the  number
              of   the   matching   element,   so   that   pairs  of  subscripts  such  as  `<b>$foo[(r)??,3]</b>'  and
              `<b>$foo[(r)??,(r)f*]</b>' are possible if the parameter is not an associative array.  If  the  parameter
              is  an  associative  array,  only  the value part of each pair is compared to the pattern, and the
              result is that value.

              If a search through an ordinary array failed, the search sets the subscript to one past the end of
              the array, and hence <b>${array[(r)</b><u>pattern</u><b>]}</b> will substitute the empty string.  Thus the success of a
              search can be tested by using the <b>(i)</b> flag, for example (assuming the option <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is not  in
              effect):

                     <b>[[</b> <b>${array[(i)pattern]}</b> <b>-le</b> <b>${#array}</b> <b>]]</b>

              If <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is in effect, the <b>-le</b> should be replaced by <b>-lt</b>.

       <b>R</b>      Like  `<b>r</b>',  but  gives the last match.  For associative arrays, gives all possible matches. May be
              used for assigning to ordinary array elements, but not for assigning to  associative  arrays.   On
              failure, for normal arrays this has the effect of returning the element corresponding to subscript
              0; this is empty unless one of the options <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> or <b>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT</b> is in effect.

              Note  that  in  subscripts  with  both `<b>r</b>' and `<b>R</b>' pattern characters are active even if they were
              substituted for a parameter (regardless of the setting of <b>GLOB_SUBST</b> which controls  this  feature
              in normal pattern matching).  The flag `<b>e</b>' can be added to inhibit pattern matching.  As this flag
              does  not  inhibit  other forms of substitution, care is still required; using a parameter to hold
              the key has the desired effect:

                     <b>key2='original</b> <b>key'</b>
                     <b>print</b> <b>${array[(Re)$key2]}</b>

       <b>i</b>      Like `<b>r</b>', but gives the index of the match instead;  this  may  not  be  combined  with  a  second
              argument.   On  the left side of an assignment, behaves like `<b>r</b>'.  For associative arrays, the key
              part of each pair is compared to the pattern, and the first matching key found is the result.   On
              failure  substitutes  the length of the array plus one, as discussed under the description of `<b>r</b>',
              or the empty string for an associative array.

              Note: Although `<b>i</b>' may be applied to a scalar substitution to find the offset of a substring,  the
              results  are  likely  to  be  misleading  when  searching within substitutions that yield an empty
              string, or when searching for the empty substring.

       <b>I</b>      Like `<b>i</b>', but gives the index of the last match, or all possible matching keys in  an  associative
              array.  On failure substitutes 0, or the empty string for an associative array.  This flag is best
              when testing for values or keys that do not exist.

              Note: If the option <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is in effect and no match is found, the result is indistinguishable
              from the case when the first element of the array matches.

       <b>k</b>      If  used  in  a  subscript on an associative array, this flag causes the keys to be interpreted as
              patterns, and returns the value for the first key found where <u>exp</u> is matched  by  the  key.   Note
              this  could  be  any such key as no ordering of associative arrays is defined.  This flag does not
              work on the left side of an assignment to an associative array element.  If used on  another  type
              of parameter, this behaves like `<b>r</b>'.

       <b>K</b>      On  an associative array this is like `<b>k</b>' but returns all values where <u>exp</u> is matched by the keys.
              On other types of parameters this has the same effect as `<b>R</b>'.

       <b>n:</b><u>expr</u><b>:</b>
              If combined with `<b>r</b>', `<b>R</b>', `<b>i</b>' or `<b>I</b>', makes them  give  the  <u>n</u>th  or  <u>n</u>th  last  match  (if  <u>expr</u>
              evaluates  to  <u>n</u>).  This flag is ignored when the array is associative.  The delimiter character <b>:</b>
              is arbitrary; see above.

       <b>b:</b><u>expr</u><b>:</b>
              If combined with `<b>r</b>', `<b>R</b>', `<b>i</b>' or `<b>I</b>', makes them begin at the <u>n</u>th or <u>n</u>th last element,  word,  or
              character  (if  <u>expr</u>  evaluates  to  <u>n</u>).  This flag is ignored when the array is associative.  The
              delimiter character <b>:</b> is arbitrary; see above.

       <b>e</b>      This flag causes any pattern matching that would be performed on the subscript to use plain string
              matching instead.  Hence `<b>${array[(re)*]}</b>' matches only the array element whose value is <b>*</b>.   Note
              that other forms of substitution such as parameter substitution are not inhibited.

              This  flag  can  also  be  used to force <b>*</b> or <b>@</b> to be interpreted as a single key rather than as a
              reference to all values.  It may be used for either purpose on the left side of an assignment.

       See <u>Parameter</u> <u>Expansion</u> <u>Flags</u> (<u><a href="../man1/zshexpn.1.html">zshexpn</a></u>(1)) for  additional  ways  to  manipulate  the  results  of  array
       subscripting.

   <b>Subscript</b> <b>Parsing</b>
       This  discussion  applies  mainly  to  associative  array  key  strings  and to patterns used for reverse
       subscripting (the `<b>r</b>', `<b>R</b>', `<b>i</b>', etc. flags), but it may also affect parameter substitutions that  appear
       as part of an arithmetic expression in an ordinary subscript.

       To  avoid  subscript  parsing  limitations  in  assignments to associative array elements, use the append
       syntax:

              <b>aa+=('key</b> <b>with</b> <b>"*strange*"</b> <b>characters'</b> <b>'value</b> <b>string')</b>

       The basic rule to remember when writing a subscript expression is that all text between the  opening  `<b>[</b>'
       and  the  closing  `<b>]</b>'  is  interpreted <u>as</u> <u>if</u> it were in double quotes (see <u><a href="../man1/zshmisc.1.html">zshmisc</a></u>(1)).  However, unlike
       double quotes which normally cannot nest, subscript expressions may appear inside  double-quoted  strings
       or inside other subscript expressions (or both!), so the rules have two important differences.

       The  first  difference  is  that  brackets  (`<b>[</b>'  and  `<b>]</b>')  must appear as balanced pairs in a subscript
       expression unless they are preceded by a backslash (`<b>\</b>').  Therefore, within a subscript expression  (and
       unlike  true double-quoting) the sequence `<b>\[</b>' becomes `<b>[</b>', and similarly `<b>\]</b>' becomes `<b>]</b>'.  This applies
       even in cases where a backslash is not normally required; for example, the pattern `<b>[^[]</b>' (to  match  any
       character other than an open bracket) should be written `<b>[^\[]</b>' in a reverse-subscript pattern.  However,
       note  that  `<b>\[^\[\]</b>'  and even `<b>\[^[]</b>' mean the <u>same</u> thing, because backslashes are always stripped when
       they appear before brackets!

       The same rule applies to parentheses (`<b>(</b>' and `<b>)</b>') and braces (`<b>{</b>' and `<b>}</b>'): they must appear  either  in
       balanced pairs or preceded by a backslash, and backslashes that protect parentheses or braces are removed
       during parsing.  This is because parameter expansions may be surrounded by balanced braces, and subscript
       flags are introduced by balanced parentheses.

       The  second  difference is that a double-quote (`<b>"</b>') may appear as part of a subscript expression without
       being preceded by a backslash, and therefore that the two characters `<b>\"</b>' remain as two characters in the
       subscript (in true double-quoting, `<b>\"</b>' becomes `<b>"</b>').  However, because of  the  standard  shell  quoting
       rules,  any  double-quotes that appear must occur in balanced pairs unless preceded by a backslash.  This
       makes it more difficult to write a subscript expression that  contains  an  odd  number  of  double-quote
       characters, but the reason for this difference is so that when a subscript expression appears inside true
       double-quotes, one can still write `<b>\"</b>' (rather than `<b>\\\"</b>') for `<b>"</b>'.

       To use an odd number of double quotes as a key in an assignment, use the <b>typeset</b> builtin and an enclosing
       pair of double quotes; to refer to the value of that key, again use double quotes:

              <b>typeset</b> <b>-A</b> <b>aa</b>
              <b>typeset</b> <b>"aa[one\"two\"three\"quotes]"=QQQ</b>
              <b>print</b> <b>"$aa[one\"two\"three\"quotes]"</b>

       It  is important to note that the quoting rules do not change when a parameter expansion with a subscript
       is nested inside another  subscript  expression.   That  is,  it  is  not  necessary  to  use  additional
       backslashes  within  the  inner  subscript  expression;  they  are  removed only once, from the innermost
       subscript outwards.  Parameters are also expanded from the innermost subscript first, as  each  expansion
       is encountered left to right in the outer expression.

       A  further  complication  arises from a way in which subscript parsing is <u>not</u> different from double quote
       parsing.  As in true double-quoting, the sequences `<b>\*</b>', and `<b>\@</b>' remain  as  two  characters  when  they
       appear  in a subscript expression.  To use a literal `<b>*</b>' or `<b>@</b>' as an associative array key, the `<b>e</b>' flag
       must be used:

              <b>typeset</b> <b>-A</b> <b>aa</b>
              <b>aa[(e)*]=star</b>
              <b>print</b> <b>$aa[(e)*]</b>

       A last detail must be considered when reverse subscripting is performed.   Parameters  appearing  in  the
       subscript  expression  are  first  expanded and then the complete expression is interpreted as a pattern.
       This has two effects: first, parameters behave as if <b>GLOB_SUBST</b> were on (and it cannot  be  turned  off);
       second,  backslashes  are interpreted twice, once when parsing the array subscript and again when parsing
       the pattern.  In a reverse subscript, it's necessary to use <u>four</u> backslashes to cause a single  backslash
       to  match  literally  in  the  pattern.   For complex patterns, it is often easiest to assign the desired
       pattern to a parameter and then refer to that parameter in the subscript, because then  the  backslashes,
       brackets,  parentheses,  etc.,  are seen only when the complete expression is converted to a pattern.  To
       match the value of a parameter  literally  in  a  reverse  subscript,  rather  than  as  a  pattern,  use
       `<b>${(q)</b><u>name</u><b>}</b>' (see <u><a href="../man1/zshexpn.1.html">zshexpn</a></u>(1)) to quote the expanded value.

       Note  that  the  `<b>k</b>'  and  `<b>K</b>'  flags are reverse subscripting for an ordinary array, but are <u>not</u> reverse
       subscripting for an associative array!  (For an associative array, the  keys  in  the  array  itself  are
       interpreted as patterns by those flags; the subscript is a plain string in that case.)

       One  final  note,  not  directly  related  to  subscripting:  the  numeric names of positional parameters
       (described below) are parsed specially, so for example `<b>$2foo</b>' is equivalent to `<b>${2}foo</b>'.  Therefore, to
       use subscript syntax to extract a substring from a positional parameter, the expansion must be surrounded
       by braces; for example, `<b>${2[3,5]}</b>' evaluates to  the  third  through  fifth  characters  of  the  second
       positional  parameter,  but  `<b>$2[3,5]</b>'  is  the  entire  second  parameter concatenated with the filename
       generation pattern `<b>[3,5]</b>'.

</pre><h4><b>POSITIONAL</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       The positional parameters provide access to the command-line arguments of a shell function, shell script,
       or the shell itself; see the section `Invocation', and also the section `Functions'.   The  parameter  <u>n</u>,
       where  <u>n</u>  is  a  number,  is the <u>n</u>th positional parameter.  The parameter `<b>$0</b>' is a special case, see the
       section `Parameters Set By The Shell'.

       The parameters <b>*</b>, <b>@</b> and <b>argv</b> are arrays containing all the positional parameters; thus `<b>$argv[</b><u>n</u><b>]</b>',  etc.,
       is  equivalent  to  simply  `<b>$</b><u>n</u>'.   Note that the options <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> or <b>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT</b> apply to these
       arrays as well, so with either of those options set, `<b>${argv[0]}</b>' is equivalent to `<b>$1</b>' and so on.

       Positional parameters may be changed after the shell or function starts by  using  the  <b>set</b>  builtin,  by
       assigning  to  the <b>argv</b> array, or by direct assignment of the form `<u>n</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>' where <u>n</u> is the number of the
       positional parameter to be changed.  This also creates (with empty values) any of the positions from 1 to
       <u>n</u> that do not already have values.  Note that, because the positional parameters form an array, an  array
       assignment  of  the  form  `<u>n</u><b>=(</b><u>value</u>  ...<b>)</b>'  is allowed, and has the effect of shifting all the values at
       positions greater than <u>n</u> by as many positions as necessary to accommodate the new values.

</pre><h4><b>LOCAL</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       Shell function executions delimit scopes for shell parameters.  (Parameters are dynamically scoped.)  The
       <b>typeset</b> builtin, and its alternative forms <b>declare</b>, <b>integer</b>, <b>local</b> and <b>readonly</b> (but not <b>export</b>), can  be
       used to declare a parameter as being local to the innermost scope.

       When  a  parameter  is read or assigned to, the innermost existing parameter of that name is used.  (That
       is, the local parameter hides any less-local parameter.)  However, assigning to a non-existent parameter,
       or declaring a new parameter with <b>export</b>, causes it to be created in the <u>outer</u>most scope.

       Local parameters disappear when their scope ends.  <b>unset</b> can be used to delete a parameter  while  it  is
       still in scope; any outer parameter of the same name remains hidden.

       Special  parameters  may  also  be  made  local;  they  retain their special attributes unless either the
       existing or the newly-created parameter has the <b>-h</b> (hide) attribute.  This may have  unexpected  effects:
       there  is no default value, so if there is no assignment at the point the variable is made local, it will
       be set to an empty value (or zero in the case of integers).  The following:

              <b>typeset</b> <b>PATH=/new/directory:$PATH</b>

       is valid for temporarily allowing the shell or  programmes  called  from  it  to  find  the  programs  in
       <b>/new/directory</b> inside a function.

       Note  that  the  restriction  in older versions of zsh that local parameters were never exported has been
       removed.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b> <b>SET</b> <b>BY</b> <b>THE</b> <b>SHELL</b></h4><pre>
       In the parameter lists that follow, the mark `&lt;S&gt;'  indicates  that  the  parameter  is  special.   `&lt;Z&gt;'
       indicates that the parameter does not exist when the shell initializes in <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b> emulation mode.

       The  parameters  `<b>!</b>',  `<b>#</b>',  `<b>*</b>',  `<b>-</b>',  `<b>?</b>',  `<b>@</b>',  `<b>$</b>',  `<b>ARGC</b>', `<b>HISTCMD</b>', `<b>LINENO</b>', `<b>PPID</b>', `<b>status</b>',
       `<b>TTYIDLE</b>', `<b>zsh_eval_context</b>', `<b>ZSH_EVAL_CONTEXT</b>', and `<b>ZSH_SUBSHELL</b>' are read-only and  thus  cannot  be
       restored  by  the  user,  so  they  are  not output by `<b>typeset</b> <b>-p</b>'.  This also applies to many read-only
       parameters loaded from modules.

       The following parameters are automatically set by the shell:

       <b>!</b> &lt;S&gt;  The process ID of the last command started in the background with <b>&amp;</b>, put into the background  with
              the <b>bg</b> builtin, or spawned with <b>coproc</b>.

       <b>#</b> &lt;S&gt;  The  number  of  positional  parameters  in  decimal.  Note that some confusion may occur with the
              syntax <b>$#</b><u>param</u> which substitutes the length of  <u>param</u>.   Use  <b>${#}</b>  to  resolve  ambiguities.   In
              particular,  the sequence `<b>$#-</b><u>...</u>' in an arithmetic expression is interpreted as the length of the
              parameter <b>-</b>, q.v.

       <b>ARGC</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Same as <b>#</b>.

       <b>$</b> &lt;S&gt;  The process ID of this shell, set when the shell initializes.  Processes  forked  from  the  shell
              without  executing  a  new program, such as command substitutions and commands grouped with <b>(</b><u>...</u><b>)</b>,
              are subshells that duplicate the current shell, and thus substitute the same value for <b>$$</b> as their
              parent shell.

       <b>-</b> &lt;S&gt;  Flags supplied to the shell on invocation or by the <b>set</b> or <b>setopt</b> commands.

       <b>*</b> &lt;S&gt;  An array containing the positional parameters.

       <b>argv</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Same as <b>*</b>.  Assigning to <b>argv</b> changes the local positional parameters, but <b>argv</b> is  <u>not</u>  itself  a
              local  parameter.   Deleting  <b>argv</b> with <b>unset</b> in any function deletes it everywhere, although only
              the innermost positional parameter array is deleted (so <b>*</b> and <b>@</b> in other scopes are not affected).

       <b>@</b> &lt;S&gt;  Same as <b>argv[@]</b>, even when <b>argv</b> is not set.

       <b>?</b> &lt;S&gt;  The exit status returned by the last command.

       <b>0</b> &lt;S&gt;  The name used to invoke the current  shell,  or  as  set  by  the  <b>-c</b>  command  line  option  upon
              invocation.   If  the  <b>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</b> option is set, <b>$0</b> is set upon entry to a shell function to
              the name of the function, and upon entry to a sourced script to the name of the script, and  reset
              to its previous value when the function or script returns.

       <b>status</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Same as <b>?</b>.

       <b>pipestatus</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              An array containing the exit statuses returned by all commands in the last pipeline.

       <b>_</b> &lt;S&gt;  The  last  argument  of  the  previous command.  Also, this parameter is set in the environment of
              every command executed to the full pathname of the command.

       <b>CPUTYPE</b>
              The machine type (microprocessor class or machine model), as determined at run time.

       <b>EGID</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The effective group ID of the shell process.  If you have sufficient privileges,  you  may  change
              the  effective  group  ID  of  the  shell  process by assigning to this parameter.  Also (assuming
              sufficient privileges), you may start a single command with a  different  effective  group  ID  by
              `<b>(EGID=</b><u>gid</u><b>;</b> <b>command)</b>'

              If this is made local, it is not implicitly set to 0, but may be explicitly set locally.

       <b>EUID</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The effective user ID of the shell process.  If you have sufficient privileges, you may change the
              effective  user ID of the shell process by assigning to this parameter.  Also (assuming sufficient
              privileges), you may start a single command with a different  effective  user  ID  by  `<b>(EUID=</b><u>uid</u><b>;</b>
              <b>command)</b>'

              If this is made local, it is not implicitly set to 0, but may be explicitly set locally.

       <b>ERRNO</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The  value  of <b>errno</b> (see <u><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></u>(3)) as set by the most recently failed system call.  This value is
              system dependent and is intended for debugging purposes.  It is also useful  with  the  <b>zsh/system</b>
              module which allows the number to be turned into a name or message.

              To  use  this  parameter, it must first be assigned a value (typically 0 (zero)).  It is initially
              unset for scripting compatibility.

       <b>FUNCNEST</b> &lt;S&gt;
              Integer.  If greater than or equal to zero, the maximum nesting depth of shell functions.  When it
              is exceeded, an error is raised at the point where a function is called.   The  default  value  is
              determined when the shell is configured, but is typically 500.  Increasing the value increases the
              danger of a runaway function recursion causing the shell to crash.  Setting a negative value turns
              off the check.

       <b>GID</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The  real  group  ID  of the shell process.  If you have sufficient privileges, you may change the
              group ID of the  shell  process  by  assigning  to  this  parameter.   Also  (assuming  sufficient
              privileges), you may start a single command under a different group ID by `<b>(GID=</b><u>gid</u><b>;</b> <b>command)</b>'

              If this is made local, it is not implicitly set to 0, but may be explicitly set locally.

       <b>HISTCMD</b>
              The  current history event number in an interactive shell, in other words the event number for the
              command that caused <b>$HISTCMD</b> to be read.  If the  current  history  event  modifies  the  history,
              <b>HISTCMD</b> changes to the new maximum history event number.

       <b>HOST</b>   The current hostname.

       <b>LINENO</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The  line  number  of  the current line within the current script, sourced file, or shell function
              being executed, whichever was started most recently.  Note that in the case of shell functions the
              line number refers to the function as it appeared in the original definition, not  necessarily  as
              displayed by the <b>functions</b> builtin.

       <b>LOGNAME</b>
              If the corresponding variable is not set in the environment of the shell, it is initialized to the
              login  name  corresponding to the current login session. This parameter is exported by default but
              this can be disabled using the <b>typeset</b> builtin.  The value is set to the string  returned  by  the
              <u><a href="../man3/getlogin.3.html">getlogin</a></u>(3) system call if that is available.

       <b>MACHTYPE</b>
              The machine type (microprocessor class or machine model), as determined at compile time.

       <b>OLDPWD</b> The previous working directory.  This is set when the shell initializes and whenever the directory
              changes.

       <b>OPTARG</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The value of the last option argument processed by the <b>getopts</b> command.

       <b>OPTIND</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The index of the last option argument processed by the <b>getopts</b> command.

       <b>OSTYPE</b> The operating system, as determined at compile time.

       <b>PPID</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The  process ID of the parent of the shell, set when the shell initializes.  As with <b>$$</b>, the value
              does not change in subshells created as a duplicate of the current shell.

       <b>PWD</b>    The present working directory.  This is set when the shell initializes and whenever the  directory
              changes.

       <b>RANDOM</b> &lt;S&gt;
              A  pseudo-random  integer from 0 to 32767, newly generated each time this parameter is referenced.
              The random number generator can be seeded by assigning a numeric value to <b>RANDOM</b>.

              The values of <b>RANDOM</b> form  an  intentionally-repeatable  pseudo-random  sequence;  subshells  that
              reference  <b>RANDOM</b>  will  result  in  identical  pseudo-random values unless the value of <b>RANDOM</b> is
              referenced or seeded in the parent shell in between subshell invocations.

       <b>SECONDS</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The number of seconds since shell invocation.  If this parameter is assigned  a  value,  then  the
              value returned upon reference will be the value that was assigned plus the number of seconds since
              the assignment.

              Unlike  other  special  parameters,  the  type  of  the <b>SECONDS</b> parameter can be changed using the
              <b>typeset</b> command.  The type may be changed only to one of the  floating  point  types  or  back  to
              integer.   For  example,  `<b>typeset</b> <b>-F</b> <b>SECONDS</b>' causes the value to be reported as a floating point
              number.  The value is available to microsecond accuracy, although the shell may show more or fewer
              digits depending on the use of  <b>typeset</b>.   See  the  documentation  for  the  builtin  <b>typeset</b>  in
              <u><a href="../man1/zshbuiltins.1.html">zshbuiltins</a></u>(1) for more details.

       <b>SHLVL</b> &lt;S&gt;
              Incremented by one each time a new shell is started.

       <b>signals</b>
              An  array containing the names of the signals.  Note that with the standard zsh numbering of array
              indices, where the first element has index 1, the signals are offset by 1 from the  signal  number
              used  by  the operating system.  For example, on typical Unix-like systems <b>HUP</b> is signal number 1,
              but is referred to as <b>$signals[2]</b>.  This is because of <b>EXIT</b> at position 1 in the array,  which  is
              used internally by zsh but is not known to the operating system.

       <b>TRY_BLOCK_ERROR</b> &lt;S&gt;
              In  an <b>always</b> block, indicates whether the preceding list of code caused an error.  The value is 1
              to indicate an error, 0 otherwise.  It may be reset, clearing the error  condition.   See  <u>Complex</u>
              <u>Commands</u> in <u><a href="../man1/zshmisc.1.html">zshmisc</a></u>(1)

       <b>TRY_BLOCK_INTERRUPT</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This variable works in a similar way to <b>TRY_BLOCK_ERROR</b>, but represents the status of an interrupt
              from the signal SIGINT, which typically comes from the keyboard when the user types <b>^C</b>.  If set to
              0,  any  such  interrupt  will  be  reset; otherwise, the interrupt is propagated after the <b>always</b>
              block.

              Note that it is possible that an interrupt arrives during the execution of the <b>always</b> block;  this
              interrupt is also propagated.

       <b>TTY</b>    The name of the tty associated with the shell, if any.

       <b>TTYIDLE</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The idle time of the tty associated with the shell in seconds or -1 if there is no such tty.

       <b>UID</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The real user ID of the shell process.  If you have sufficient privileges, you may change the user
              ID  of  the  shell by assigning to this parameter.  Also (assuming sufficient privileges), you may
              start a single command under a different user ID by `<b>(UID=</b><u>uid</u><b>;</b> <b>command)</b>'

              If this is made local, it is not implicitly set to 0, but may be explicitly set locally.

       <b>USERNAME</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The username corresponding to the real user ID of the  shell  process.   If  you  have  sufficient
              privileges,  you  may  change  the  username  (and  also the user ID and group ID) of the shell by
              assigning to this parameter.  Also (assuming  sufficient  privileges),  you  may  start  a  single
              command under a different username (and user ID and group ID) by `<b>(USERNAME=</b><u>username</u><b>;</b> <b>command)</b>'

       <b>VENDOR</b> The vendor, as determined at compile time.

       <b>zsh_eval_context</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>ZSH_EVAL_CONTEXT</b> &lt;S&gt;)
              An array (colon-separated list) indicating the context of shell code that is being run.  Each time
              a piece of shell code that is stored within the shell is executed a string is temporarily appended
              to  the  array to indicate the type of operation that is being performed.  Read in order the array
              gives an indication of the stack of operations being performed with  the  most  immediate  context
              last.

              Note  that  the  variable  does  not  give  information  on syntactic context such as pipelines or
              subshells.  Use <b>$ZSH_SUBSHELL</b> to detect subshells.

              The context is one of the following:
              <b>cmdarg</b> Code specified by the <b>-c</b> option to the command line that invoked the shell.

              <b>cmdsubst</b>
                     Command substitution using the <b>`</b><u>...</u><b>`</b> or <b>$(</b><u>...</u><b>)</b> construct.

              <b>equalsubst</b>
                     File substitution using the <b>=(</b><u>...</u><b>)</b> construct.

              <b>eval</b>   Code executed by the <b>eval</b> builtin.

              <b>evalautofunc</b>
                     Code executed with the <b>KSH_AUTOLOAD</b> mechanism in order to define an autoloaded function.

              <b>fc</b>     Code from the shell history executed by the <b>-e</b> option to the <b>fc</b> builtin.

              <b>file</b>   Lines of code being read directly from a file, for example by the <b>source</b> builtin.

              <b>filecode</b>
                     Lines of code being read from a <b>.zwc</b> file instead of directly from the source file.

              <b>globqual</b>
                     Code executed by the <b>e</b> or <b>+</b> glob qualifier.

              <b>globsort</b>
                     Code executed to order files by the <b>o</b> glob qualifier.

              <b>insubst</b>
                     File substitution using the <b>&lt;(</b><u>...</u><b>)</b> construct.

              <b>loadautofunc</b>
                     Code read directly from a file to define an autoloaded function.

              <b>outsubst</b>
                     File substitution using the <b>&gt;(</b><u>...</u><b>)</b> construct.

              <b>sched</b>  Code executed by the <b>sched</b> builtin.

              <b>shfunc</b> A shell function.

              <b>stty</b>   Code passed to <b>stty</b> by the <b>STTY</b> environment variable.  Normally this is passed directly  to
                     the system's <b>stty</b> command, so this value is unlikely to be seen in practice.

              <b>style</b>  Code executed as part of a style retrieved by the <b>zstyle</b> builtin from the <b>zsh/zutil</b> module.

              <b>toplevel</b>
                     The highest execution level of a script or interactive shell.

              <b>trap</b>   Code  executed  as a trap defined by the <b>trap</b> builtin.  Traps defined as functions have the
                     context <b>shfunc</b>.  As traps are asynchronous they may have a different hierarchy  from  other
                     code.

              <b>zpty</b>   Code executed by the <b>zpty</b> builtin from the <b>zsh/zpty</b> module.

              <b>zregexparse-guard</b>
                     Code executed as a guard by the <b>zregexparse</b> command from the <b>zsh/zutil</b> module.

              <b>zregexparse-action</b>
                     Code executed as an action by the <b>zregexparse</b> command from the <b>zsh/zutil</b> module.

       <b>ZSH_ARGZERO</b>
              If  zsh  was  invoked  to run a script, this is the name of the script.  Otherwise, it is the name
              used to invoke the current shell.  This is the same as the value  of  <b>$0</b>  when  the  <b>POSIX_ARGZERO</b>
              option is set, but is always available.

       <b>ZSH_EXECUTION_STRING</b>
              If  the  shell  was  started  with the option <b>-c</b>, this contains the argument passed to the option.
              Otherwise it is not set.

       <b>ZSH_NAME</b>
              Expands to the basename of the command used to invoke this instance of zsh.

       <b>ZSH_PATCHLEVEL</b>
              The output of `<b>git</b> <b>describe</b> <b>--tags</b> <b>--long</b>' for the zsh repository used to build the  shell.   This
              is  most  useful  in  order  to  keep  track  of  versions of the shell during development between
              releases; hence most users should not use it and should instead rely on <b>$ZSH_VERSION</b>.

       <b>zsh_scheduled_events</b>
              See the section `The zsh/sched Module' in <u><a href="../man1/zshmodules.1.html">zshmodules</a></u>(1).

       <b>ZSH_SCRIPT</b>
              If zsh was invoked to run a script, this is the name of the script, otherwise it is unset.

       <b>ZSH_SUBSHELL</b>
              Readonly integer.  Initially zero, incremented each time the shell forks to create a subshell  for
              executing  code.  Hence `<b>(print</b> <b>$ZSH_SUBSHELL)</b>' and `<b>print</b> <b>$(print</b> <b>$ZSH_SUBSHELL)</b>' output 1, while
              `<b>(</b> <b>(print</b> <b>$ZSH_SUBSHELL)</b> <b>)</b>' outputs 2.

       <b>ZSH_VERSION</b>
              The version number of the release of zsh.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b> <b>USED</b> <b>BY</b> <b>THE</b> <b>SHELL</b></h4><pre>
       The following parameters are used by the shell.  Again, `&lt;S&gt;' indicates that the parameter is special and
       `&lt;Z&gt;' indicates that the parameter does not exist when the shell initializes in <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b> emulation mode.

       In cases where there are two parameters with an upper- and lowercase form of the same name, such as  <b>path</b>
       and  <b>PATH</b>,  the  lowercase  form  is an array and the uppercase form is a scalar with the elements of the
       array joined together by colons.  These are similar to tied parameters created  via  `<b>typeset</b>  <b>-T</b>'.   The
       normal  use  for  the  colon-separated  form is for exporting to the environment, while the array form is
       easier to manipulate within the shell.  Note that unsetting either of the pair will unset the other; they
       retain their special properties when recreated, and recreating one of the pair will recreate the other.

       <b>ARGV0</b>  If exported, its value is used as the <b>argv[0]</b> of external commands.  Usually  used  in  constructs
              like `<b>ARGV0=emacs</b> <b>nethack</b>'.

       <b>BAUD</b>   The  rate  in  bits  per second at which data reaches the terminal.  The line editor will use this
              value in order to compensate for a  slow  terminal  by  delaying  updates  to  the  display  until
              necessary.   If  the  parameter is unset or the value is zero the compensation mechanism is turned
              off.  The parameter is not set by default.

              This parameter may be profitably set in some circumstances, e.g.  for slow modems dialing  into  a
              communications  server,  or on a slow wide area network.  It should be set to the baud rate of the
              slowest part of the link for best performance.

       <b>cdpath</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>CDPATH</b> &lt;S&gt;)
              An array (colon-separated list) of directories specifying the search path for the <b>cd</b> command.

       <b>COLUMNS</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The number of columns for this terminal session.  Used for printing select lists and for the  line
              editor.

       <b>CORRECT_IGNORE</b>
              If set, is treated as a pattern during spelling correction.  Any potential correction that matches
              the  pattern  is  ignored.  For example, if the value is `<b>_*</b>' then completion functions (which, by
              convention, have names beginning with `<b>_</b>') will never be offered  as  spelling  corrections.   The
              pattern  does  not apply to the correction of file names, as applied by the <b>CORRECT_ALL</b> option (so
              with the example just given files beginning with `<b>_</b>' in  the  current  directory  would  still  be
              completed).

       <b>CORRECT_IGNORE_FILE</b>
              If  set,  is  treated  as  a pattern during spelling correction of file names.  Any file name that
              matches the pattern is never offered as a correction.  For example, if the value is `<b>.*</b>' then  dot
              file  names  will  never  be offered as spelling corrections.  This is useful with the <b>CORRECT_ALL</b>
              option.

       <b>DIRSTACKSIZE</b>
              The maximum size of the directory stack, by default there is no limit.  If the stack  gets  larger
              than this, it will be truncated automatically.  This is useful with the <b>AUTO_PUSHD</b> option.

       <b>ENV</b>    If the <b>ENV</b> environment variable is set when zsh is invoked as <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b>, <b>$ENV</b> is sourced after the
              profile  scripts.  The value of <b>ENV</b> is subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and
              arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a pathname.  Note that <b>ENV</b> is <u>not</u> used unless the
              shell is interactive and zsh is emulating <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b>.

       <b>FCEDIT</b> The default editor for the <b>fc</b> builtin.  If <b>FCEDIT</b> is not set, the parameter  <b>EDITOR</b>  is  used;  if
              that is not set either, a builtin default, usually <b>vi</b>, is used.

       <b>fignore</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>FIGNORE</b> &lt;S&gt;)
              An  array  (colon  separated  list) containing the suffixes of files to be ignored during filename
              completion.  However, if completion only generates files with suffixes in this  list,  then  these
              files are completed anyway.

       <b>fpath</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>FPATH</b> &lt;S&gt;)
              An  array  (colon  separated  list)  of  directories  specifying  the  search  path  for  function
              definitions.  This path is searched when a function with the <b>-u</b> attribute is  referenced.   If  an
              executable file is found, then it is read and executed in the current environment.

       <b>histchars</b> &lt;S&gt;
              Three  characters used by the shell's history and lexical analysis mechanism.  The first character
              signals the start of a history expansion (default `<b>!</b>').  The second character signals the start of
              a quick history substitution (default `<b>^</b>').  The third character is the comment character (default
              `<b>#</b>').

              The characters must be in the ASCII character set; any attempt to set <b>histchars</b> to characters with
              a locale-dependent meaning will be rejected with an error message.

       <b>HISTCHARS</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Same as <b>histchars</b>.  (Deprecated.)

       <b>HISTFILE</b>
              The file to save the history in when an interactive shell exits.  If unset,  the  history  is  not
              saved.

       <b>HISTORY_IGNORE</b>
              If  set,  is  treated  as  a pattern at the time history files are written.  Any potential history
              entry that matches the pattern is skipped.  For example, if the value is `<b>fc</b> <b>*</b>' then commands that
              invoke the interactive history editor are never written to the history file.

              Note  that  <b>HISTORY_IGNORE</b>  defines  a  single  pattern:   to   specify   alternatives   use   the
              `<b>(</b><u>first</u><b>|</b><u>second</u><b>|</b><u>...</u><b>)</b>' syntax.

              Compare  the  <b>HIST_NO_STORE</b>  option  or the <b>zshaddhistory</b> hook, either of which would prevent such
              commands from being added to the interactive history at all.  If you wish to use <b>HISTORY_IGNORE</b> to
              stop history being added in the first place, you can define the following hook:

                     <b>zshaddhistory()</b> <b>{</b>
                       <b>emulate</b> <b>-L</b> <b>zsh</b>
                       <b>##</b> <b>uncomment</b> <b>if</b> <b>HISTORY_IGNORE</b>
                       <b>##</b> <b>should</b> <b>use</b> <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> <b>syntax</b>
                       <b>#</b> <b>setopt</b> <b>extendedglob</b>
                       <b>[[</b> <b>$1</b> <b>!=</b> <b>${~HISTORY_IGNORE}</b> <b>]]</b>
                     <b>}</b>

       <b>HISTSIZE</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The  maximum  number  of  events  stored  in  the  internal  history  list.   If   you   use   the
              <b>HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST</b>  option, setting this value larger than the <b>SAVEHIST</b> size will give you the
              difference as a cushion for saving duplicated history events.

              If this is made local, it is not implicitly set to 0, but may be explicitly set locally.

       <b>HOME</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The default argument for the <b>cd</b> command.  This is not set automatically by the shell in <b>sh</b>, <b>ksh</b> or
              <b>csh</b> emulation, but it is typically present in the environment anyway, and if it becomes set it has
              its usual special behaviour.

       <b>IFS</b> &lt;S&gt;
              Internal field separators (by default space, tab, newline and NUL),  that  are  used  to  separate
              words  which  result  from command or parameter expansion and words read by the <b>read</b> builtin.  Any
              characters from the set space, tab and newline that appear in the IFS are called <u>IFS</u> <u>white</u>  <u>space</u>.
              One  or  more  IFS  white  space characters or one non-IFS white space character together with any
              adjacent IFS white space character delimit a field.  If an IFS white space character appears twice
              consecutively in the IFS, this character is  treated  as  if  it  were  not  an  IFS  white  space
              character.

              If the parameter is unset, the default is used.  Note this has a different effect from setting the
              parameter to an empty string.

       <b>KEYBOARD_HACK</b>
              This  variable  defines  a  character  to  be  removed  from  the  end  of the command line before
              interpreting it (interactive shells only). It is intended to fix  the  problem  with  keys  placed
              annoyingly  close  to return and replaces the <b>SUNKEYBOARDHACK</b> option which did this for backquotes
              only.  Should the chosen character be one of singlequote, doublequote  or  backquote,  there  must
              also be an odd number of them on the command line for the last one to be removed.

              For  backward  compatibility,  if  the  <b>SUNKEYBOARDHACK</b>  option  is  explicitly  set, the value of
              <b>KEYBOARD_HACK</b> reverts to backquote.  If the option is explicitly unset, this variable  is  set  to
              empty.

       <b>KEYTIMEOUT</b>
              The  time  the  shell  waits, in hundredths of seconds, for another key to be pressed when reading
              bound multi-character sequences.

       <b>LANG</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This variable determines the locale category for any category  not  specifically  selected  via  a
              variable starting with `<b>LC_</b>'.

       <b>LC_ALL</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This  variable  overrides  the  value  of  the  `<b>LANG</b>'  variable and the value of any of the other
              variables starting with `<b>LC_</b>'.

       <b>LC_COLLATE</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This variable determines the locale category for character collation information within ranges  in
              glob brackets and for sorting.

       <b>LC_CTYPE</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This  variable  determines the locale category for character handling functions.  If the <b>MULTIBYTE</b>
              option is in effect this variable or <b>LANG</b> should contain a value that reflects the  character  set
              in  use,  even if it is a single-byte character set, unless only the 7-bit subset (ASCII) is used.
              For example, if the character set is ISO-8859-1, a suitable value might be <b>en_US.iso88591</b> (certain
              Linux distributions) or <b>en_US.ISO8859-1</b> (MacOS).

       <b>LC_MESSAGES</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This variable determines the language in which messages should be written.  Note that zsh does not
              use message catalogs.

       <b>LC_NUMERIC</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This variable affects the decimal point  character  and  thousands  separator  character  for  the
              formatted  input/output  functions  and  string  conversion functions.  Note that zsh ignores this
              setting when parsing floating point mathematical expressions.

       <b>LC_TIME</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This variable determines the locale category  for  date  and  time  formatting  in  prompt  escape
              sequences.

       <b>LINES</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The  number  of  lines for this terminal session.  Used for printing select lists and for the line
              editor.

       <b>LISTMAX</b>
              In the line editor, the number of matches to list without asking first. If the value is  negative,
              the  list  will be shown if it spans at most as many lines as given by the absolute value.  If set
              to zero, the shell asks only if the top of the listing would scroll off the screen.

       <b>MAIL</b>   If this parameter is set and <b>mailpath</b> is not set, the shell looks for mail in the specified file.

       <b>MAILCHECK</b>
              The interval in seconds between checks for new mail.

       <b>mailpath</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>MAILPATH</b> &lt;S&gt;)
              An array (colon-separated list) of filenames to check for new mail.  Each filename can be followed
              by a `<b>?</b>' and a message that will be  printed.   The  message  will  undergo  parameter  expansion,
              command substitution and arithmetic expansion with the variable <b>$_</b> defined as the name of the file
              that  has  changed.   The  default  message  is `<b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>new</b> <b>mail</b>'.  If an element is a directory
              instead of a file the shell will recursively  check  every  file  in  every  subdirectory  of  the
              element.

       <b>manpath</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>MANPATH</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;)
              An  array  (colon-separated  list) whose value is not used by the shell.  The <b>manpath</b> array can be
              useful, however, since setting it also sets <b>MANPATH</b>, and vice versa.

       <b>match</b>
       <b>mbegin</b>
       <b>mend</b>   Arrays set by the shell when the <b>b</b> globbing flag is used in pattern matches.  See  the  subsection
              <u>Globbing</u> <u>flags</u> in the documentation for <u>Filename</u> <u>Generation</u> in <u><a href="../man1/zshexpn.1.html">zshexpn</a></u>(1).

       <b>MATCH</b>
       <b>MBEGIN</b>
       <b>MEND</b>   Set by the shell when the <b>m</b> globbing flag is used in pattern matches.  See the subsection <u>Globbing</u>
              <u>flags</u> in the documentation for <u>Filename</u> <u>Generation</u> in <u><a href="../man1/zshexpn.1.html">zshexpn</a></u>(1).

       <b>module_path</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>MODULE_PATH</b> &lt;S&gt;)
              An  array  (colon-separated  list)  of directories that <b>zmodload</b> searches for dynamically loadable
              modules.  This is initialized to a standard pathname,  usually  `<b>/usr/local/lib/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION</b>'.
              (The  `<b><a href="file:/usr/local/lib">/usr/local/lib</a></b>'  part varies from installation to installation.)  For security reasons, any
              value set in the environment when the shell is started will be ignored.

              These parameters only exist if the installation supports dynamic module loading.

       <b>NULLCMD</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The command name to assume if a redirection is specified with no command.  Defaults to  <b>cat</b>.   For
              <b>sh</b>/<b>ksh</b>  behavior,  change  this to <b>:</b>.  For <b>csh</b>-like behavior, unset this parameter; the shell will
              print an error message if null commands are entered.

       <b>path</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>PATH</b> &lt;S&gt;)
              An array (colon-separated list) of directories to search for commands.   When  this  parameter  is
              set, each directory is scanned and all files found are put in a hash table.

       <b>POSTEDIT</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This  string  is  output  whenever  the line editor exits.  It usually contains termcap strings to
              reset the terminal.

       <b>PROMPT</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
       <b>PROMPT2</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
       <b>PROMPT3</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
       <b>PROMPT4</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Same as <b>PS1</b>, <b>PS2</b>, <b>PS3</b> and <b>PS4</b>, respectively.

       <b>prompt</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Same as <b>PS1</b>.

       <b>PROMPT_EOL_MARK</b>
              When the <b>PROMPT_CR</b> and <b>PROMPT_SP</b> options are set, the <b>PROMPT_EOL_MARK</b> parameter  can  be  used  to
              customize how the end of partial lines are shown.  This parameter undergoes prompt expansion, with
              the  <b>PROMPT_PERCENT</b>  option  set.   If  not  set,  the default behavior is equivalent to the value
              `<b>%B%S%#%s%b</b>'.

       <b>PS1</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The primary prompt string, printed before a command is read.   It  undergoes  a  special  form  of
              expansion before being displayed; see EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in <u><a href="../man1/zshmisc.1.html">zshmisc</a></u>(1).  The default is
              `<b>%m%#</b> '.

       <b>PS2</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The  secondary prompt, printed when the shell needs more information to complete a command.  It is
              expanded in the same way as <b>PS1</b>.  The default is `<b>%_&gt;</b> ', which displays any  shell  constructs  or
              quotation marks which are currently being processed.

       <b>PS3</b> &lt;S&gt;
              Selection  prompt  used within a <b>select</b> loop.  It is expanded in the same way as <b>PS1</b>.  The default
              is `<b>?#</b> '.

       <b>PS4</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The execution trace prompt.  Default is `<b>+%N:%i&gt;</b> ', which displays the name of the  current  shell
              structure and the line number within it.  In sh or ksh emulation, the default is `<b>+</b> '.

       <b>psvar</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>PSVAR</b> &lt;S&gt;)
              An  array (colon-separated list) whose elements can be used in <b>PROMPT</b> strings.  Setting <b>psvar</b> also
              sets <b>PSVAR</b>, and vice versa.

       <b>READNULLCMD</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The command name to assume if a single input redirection is specified with no  command.   Defaults
              to <b>more</b>.

       <b>REPORTMEMORY</b>
              If  nonnegative, commands whose maximum resident set size (roughly speaking, main memory usage) in
              kilobytes is greater than this value have timing statistics reported.  The format used  to  output
              statistics is the value of the <b>TIMEFMT</b> parameter, which is the same as for the <b>REPORTTIME</b> variable
              and the <b>time</b> builtin; note that by default this does not output memory usage.  Appending <b>"</b> <b>max</b> <b>RSS</b>
              <b>%M"</b>  to  the  value  of  <b>TIMEFMT</b>  causes  it  to  output  the value that triggered the report.  If
              <b>REPORTTIME</b> is also in use, at most a single report is printed for  both  triggers.   This  feature
              requires the <b>getrusage()</b> system call, commonly supported by modern Unix-like systems.

       <b>REPORTTIME</b>
              If  nonnegative, commands whose combined user and system execution times (measured in seconds) are
              greater than this value have timing  statistics  printed  for  them.   Output  is  suppressed  for
              commands  executed  within  the line editor, including completion; commands explicitly marked with
              the <b>time</b> keyword still cause the summary to be printed in this case.

       <b>REPLY</b>  This parameter is reserved by convention to pass string values between  shell  scripts  and  shell
              builtins  in  situations  where a function call or redirection are impossible or undesirable.  The
              <b>read</b> builtin and the <b>select</b> complex command may set <b>REPLY</b>, and filename generation both  sets  and
              examines  its  value  when  evaluating  certain  expressions.   Some modules also employ <b>REPLY</b> for
              similar purposes.

       <b>reply</b>  As <b>REPLY</b>, but for array values rather than strings.

       <b>RPROMPT</b> &lt;S&gt;
       <b>RPS1</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This prompt is displayed on the right-hand side of the screen when the  primary  prompt  is  being
              displayed  on  the left.  This does not work if the <b>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</b> option is set.  It is expanded
              in the same way as <b>PS1</b>.

       <b>RPROMPT2</b> &lt;S&gt;
       <b>RPS2</b> &lt;S&gt;
              This prompt is displayed on the right-hand side of the screen when the secondary prompt  is  being
              displayed  on  the left.  This does not work if the <b>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</b> option is set.  It is expanded
              in the same way as <b>PS2</b>.

       <b>SAVEHIST</b>
              The maximum number of history events to save in the history file.

              If this is made local, it is not implicitly set to 0, but may be explicitly set locally.

       <b>SPROMPT</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The prompt used for spelling correction.  The sequence `<b>%R</b>' expands to the string which presumably
              needs spelling correction, and `<b>%r</b>' expands to the proposed correction.  All other prompt  escapes
              are also allowed.

              The actions available at the prompt are <b>[nyae]</b>:
              <b>n</b> (`no') (default)
                     Discard the correction and run the command.
              <b>y</b> (`yes')
                     Make the correction and run the command.
              <b>a</b> (`abort')
                     Discard the entire command line without running it.
              <b>e</b> (`edit')
                     Resume editing the command line.

       <b>STTY</b>   If  this  parameter  is  set  in a command's environment, the shell runs the <b>stty</b> command with the
              value of this parameter as arguments in order to set up the terminal before executing the command.
              The modes apply only to the command, and are reset when  it  finishes  or  is  suspended.  If  the
              command  is  suspended  and  continued  later  with  the <b>fg</b> or <b>wait</b> builtins it will see the modes
              specified by <b>STTY</b>, as if it were not suspended.   This  (intentionally)  does  not  apply  if  the
              command  is  continued via `<b>kill</b> <b>-CONT</b>'.  <b>STTY</b> is ignored if the command is run in the background,
              or if it is in the environment of the shell but not explicitly assigned to in the input line. This
              avoids running stty at every external command by accidentally exporting it. Also  note  that  <b>STTY</b>
              should not be used for window size specifications; these will not be local to the command.

              If  the parameter is set and empty, all of the above applies except that <b>stty</b> is not run. This can
              be useful as a way to freeze the tty  around  a  single  command,  blocking  its  changes  to  tty
              settings, similar to the <b>ttyctl</b> builtin.

       <b>TERM</b> &lt;S&gt;
              The  type  of  terminal in use.  This is used when looking up termcap sequences.  An assignment to
              <b>TERM</b> causes zsh to  re-initialize  the  terminal,  even  if  the  value  does  not  change  (e.g.,
              `<b>TERM=$TERM</b>').   It  is  necessary  to  make  such  an  assignment upon any change to the terminal
              definition database or terminal type in order for the new settings to take effect.

       <b>TERMINFO</b> &lt;S&gt;
              A reference to your terminfo database, used by the `terminfo' library when the system has it;  see
              <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5).   If  set,  this causes the shell to reinitialise the terminal, making the workaround
              `<b>TERM=$TERM</b>' unnecessary.

       <b>TERMINFO_DIRS</b> &lt;S&gt;
              A colon-seprarated list of terminfo databases, used by the `terminfo' library when the system  has
              it;  see  <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5).  This  variable  is  only used by certain terminal libraries, in particular
              ncurses; see <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5) to check support on your system.   If  set,  this  causes  the  shell  to
              reinitialise the terminal, making the workaround `<b>TERM=$TERM</b>' unnecessary.  Note that unlike other
              colon-separated arrays this is not tied to a zsh array.

       <b>TIMEFMT</b>
              The  format  of process time reports with the <b>time</b> keyword.  The default is `<b>%J</b>  <b>%U</b> <b>user</b> <b>%S</b> <b>system</b>
              <b>%P</b> <b>cpu</b> <b>%*E</b> <b>total</b>'.  Recognizes the following escape sequences, although not all may  be  available
              on all systems, and some that are available may not be useful:

              <b>%%</b>     A `<b>%</b>'.
              <b>%U</b>     CPU seconds spent in user mode.
              <b>%S</b>     CPU seconds spent in kernel mode.
              <b>%E</b>     Elapsed time in seconds.
              <b>%P</b>     The CPU percentage, computed as 100*(<b>%U</b>+<b>%S</b>)/<b>%E</b>.
              <b>%W</b>     Number of times the process was swapped.
              <b>%X</b>     The average amount in (shared) text space used in kilobytes.
              <b>%D</b>     The average amount in (unshared) data/stack space used in kilobytes.
              <b>%K</b>     The total space used (<b>%X</b>+<b>%D</b>) in kilobytes.
              <b>%M</b>     The  maximum memory the process had in use at any time in kilobytes.
              <b>%F</b>     The number of major page faults (page needed to be brought from disk).
              <b>%R</b>     The number of minor page faults.
              <b>%I</b>     The number of input operations.
              <b>%O</b>     The number of output operations.
              <b>%r</b>     The number of socket messages received.
              <b>%s</b>     The number of socket messages sent.
              <b>%k</b>     The number of signals received.
              <b>%w</b>     Number of voluntary context switches (waits).
              <b>%c</b>     Number of involuntary context switches.
              <b>%J</b>     The name of this job.

              A star may be inserted between the percent sign and flags printing time (e.g., `<b>%*E</b>'); this causes
              the  time  to  be printed in `<u>hh</u><b>:</b><u>mm</u><b>:</b><u>ss</u><b>.</b><u>ttt</u>' format (hours and minutes are only printed if they are
              not zero).  Alternatively, `<b>m</b>' or `<b>u</b>' may  be  used  (e.g.,  `<b>%mE</b>')  to  produce  time  output  in
              milliseconds or microseconds, respectively.

       <b>TMOUT</b>  If  this  parameter  is nonzero, the shell will receive an <b>ALRM</b> signal if a command is not entered
              within the specified number of seconds after issuing a prompt. If there is a trap on  <b>SIGALRM</b>,  it
              will  be  executed  and  a  new  alarm  is  scheduled using the value of the <b>TMOUT</b> parameter after
              executing the trap.  If no trap is set, and the idle time of the terminal is  not  less  than  the
              value of the <b>TMOUT</b> parameter, zsh terminates.  Otherwise a new alarm is scheduled to <b>TMOUT</b> seconds
              after the last keypress.

       <b>TMPPREFIX</b>
              A pathname prefix which the shell will use for all temporary files.  Note that this should include
              an initial part for the file name as well as any directory names.  The default is `<b>/tmp/zsh</b>'.

       <b>TMPSUFFIX</b>
              A  filename  suffix  which the shell will use for temporary files created by process substitutions
              (e.g., `<b>=(</b><u>list</u><b>)</b><u>').</u>  <u>Note</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>value</u> <u>should</u> <u>include</u>  <u>a</u>  <u>leading</u>  <u>dot</u>  <u>`</u><b>.</b><u>'</u>  <u>if</u>  <u>intended</u>  <u>to</u>  <u>be</u>
              <u>interpreted</u>  <u>as</u>  <u>a</u>  <u>file</u>  <u>extension.</u>  <u>The</u> <u>default</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>to</u> <u>append</u> <u>any</u> <u>suffix,</u> <u>thus</u> <u>this</u> <u>parameter</u>
              <u>should</u> <u>be</u> <u>assigned</u> <u>only</u> <u>when</u> <u>needed</u> <u>and</u> <u>then</u> <u>unset</u> <u>again.</u>

       <b>WORDCHARS</b> &lt;S&gt;
              A list of non-alphanumeric characters considered part of a word by the line editor.

       <b>ZBEEP</b>  If set, this gives a string of characters, which can use all the same codes as the <b>bindkey</b> command
              as described in the zsh/zle module entry in <u><a href="../man1/zshmodules.1.html">zshmodules</a></u>(1), that will be  output  to  the  terminal
              instead of beeping.  This may have a visible instead of an audible effect; for example, the string
              `<b>\e[?5h\e[?5l</b>'  on  a vt100 or xterm will have the effect of flashing reverse video on and off (if
              you usually use reverse video, you should use the  string  `<b>\e[?5l\e[?5h</b>'  instead).   This  takes
              precedence over the <b>NOBEEP</b> option.

       <b>ZDOTDIR</b>
              The directory to search for shell startup files (.zshrc, etc), if not <b>$HOME</b>.

       <b>zle_bracketed_paste</b>
              Many  terminal  emulators  have a feature that allows applications to identify when text is pasted
              into the terminal rather than being typed normally. For ZLE, this means  that  special  characters
              such  as  tabs  and  newlines  can  be inserted instead of invoking editor commands.  Furthermore,
              pasted text forms a single undo event and if the region is active, pasted text  will  replace  the
              region.

              This  two-element  array  contains  the  terminal  escape sequences for enabling and disabling the
              feature. These escape sequences are used to enable bracketed paste when ZLE is active and  disable
              it  at  other  times.   Unsetting  the  parameter  has the effect of ensuring that bracketed paste
              remains disabled.

       <b>zle_highlight</b>
              An array describing contexts in  which  ZLE  should  highlight  the  input  text.   See  <u>Character</u>
              <u>Highlighting</u> in <u><a href="../man1/zshzle.1.html">zshzle</a></u>(1).

       <b>ZLE_LINE_ABORTED</b>
              This  parameter  is  set  by  the line editor when an error occurs.  It contains the line that was
              being edited at the point of the error.  `<b>print</b> <b>-zr</b> <b>--</b> <b>$ZLE_LINE_ABORTED</b>' can be used  to  recover
              the line.  Only the most recent line of this kind is remembered.

       <b>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b>
       <b>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b>
              These  parameters are used by the line editor.  In certain circumstances suffixes (typically space
              or slash) added by the completion system will be removed automatically, either  because  the  next
              editing  command was not an insertable character, or because the character was marked as requiring
              the suffix to be removed.

              These variables can contain the sets of characters that will cause the suffix to be  removed.   If
              <b>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b>  is  set,  those  characters  will  cause  the  suffix  to  be removed; if
              <b>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b> is set, those characters will cause the suffix to be removed  and  replaced
              by a space.

              If <b>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b> is not set, the default behaviour is equivalent to:

                     <b>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS=$'</b> <b>\t\n;&amp;|'</b>

              If   <b>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b>   is   set   but   is  empty,  no  characters  have  this  behaviour.
              <b>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b> takes precedence, so that the following:

                     <b>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS=$'&amp;|'</b>

              causes the characters `<b>&amp;</b>' and `<b>|</b>' to remove the suffix but to replace it with a space.

              To illustrate the difference, suppose that the option  <b>AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH</b>  is  in  effect  and  the
              directory  <b>DIR</b>  has  just  been completed, with an appended <b>/</b>, following which the user types `<b>&amp;</b>'.
              The default result is `<b>DIR&amp;</b>'.  With <b>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b> set  but  without  including  `<b>&amp;</b>'  the
              result is `<b>DIR/&amp;</b>'.  With <b>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b> set to include `<b>&amp;</b>' the result is `<b>DIR</b> <b>&amp;</b>'.

              Note  that certain completions may provide their own suffix removal or replacement behaviour which
              overrides the values described here.  See the completion system documentation in <u><a href="../man1/zshcompsys.1.html">zshcompsys</a></u>(1).

       <b>ZLE_RPROMPT_INDENT</b> &lt;S&gt;
              If set, used to give the indentation between the right hand side of the right prompt in  the  line
              editor as given by <b>RPS1</b> or <b>RPROMPT</b> and the right hand side of the screen.  If not set, the value 1
              is used.

              Typically  this will be used to set the value to 0 so that the prompt appears flush with the right
              hand side of the screen.  This is not the default as many terminals do not handle this  correctly,
              in  particular  when the prompt appears at the extreme bottom right of the screen.  Recent virtual
              terminals are more likely to handle this case correctly.  Some experimentation is necessary.
