</pre><h4><b>GRASS</b> <b>variables</b> <b>and</b> <b>environment</b> <b>variables</b></h4><pre>
       A  variable  in scripting is a symbolic name that holds data which can be used and modified during script
       execution. Variables allow scripts to store and manipulate values dynamically, making them more  flexible
       and reusable.  In GRASS GIS, there are two types of variables:

           •   shell environment variables,

           •   GRASS gisenv variables.
       There are a number of <u>shell</u> environment variable groups:

           •   variables for rendering

           •   variables for internal use
       <u>Note:</u>  Any  setting  which  needs  to be modifiable by a GRASS module (e.g. MONITOR by <u>d.mon</u>) has to be a
       GRASS gisenv variable.

</pre><h4><b>Setting</b> <b>shell</b> <b>environment</b> <b>variables</b></h4><pre>
       Setting shell environment variables depends on the shell being used:
       Bash:
       export VARIABLE=value
       Csh:
       setenv VARIABLE value
       Cmd.exe (Windows):
       set VARIABLE=value
       To set up shell environment variables permanently:

           •   To get personal BASH shell definitions (aliases, color listing option, ...)   into  GRASS,  store
               them in:
               $HOME/.grass8/bashrc

           •   To  get  personal  CSH  shell definitions (aliases, color listing option, ...)  into GRASS, store
               them in:
               $HOME/.grass8/cshrc

</pre><h4><b>Setting</b> <b>GRASS</b> <b>gisenv</b> <b>variables</b></h4><pre>
       Use <u>g.gisenv</u> within GRASS. This permanently predefines  GRASS  variables  in  the  $HOME/.grass8/rc  file
       (Linux,  Mac,  BSD,  ...)   or  in the %APPDATA%\Roaming\GRASS8\rc file (Windows) after the current GRASS
       session is closed.
       Usage:
       g.gisenv set="VARIABLE=VALUE"
       It looks unusual with two equals signs, but <u>g.gisenv</u> serves dual  duty  for  getting  and  setting  GRASS
       variables.

       If the user just specifies a variable name, it defaults to <b>get</b> mode.  For example:
       g.gisenv MAPSET
       PERMANENT

</pre><h4><b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>(GRASS</b> <b>related)</b> <b>shell</b> <b>environment</b> <b>variables</b></h4><pre>
       [ To be set from the terminal shell or startup scripts ]

       GISBASE
           directory where GRASS lives. This is set automatically by the startup script.

       GISRC
           name  of $HOME/.grass8/rc file. Defines the system wide value when starting a GRASS session. Within a
           GRASS session, a temporary copy of this file will be used.

       GRASS_ADDON_PATH
           [grass startup script, g.extension]
           specifies additional path(s) containing local and/or custom  GRASS  modules  extra  to  the  standard
           distribution.

       GRASS_ADDON_BASE
           [grass startup script]
           allows  specifying  additional GISBASE for local GRASS modules (normally installed as GRASS Addons by
           g.extension module) extra to standard distribution. The default on GNU/Linux is $HOME/.grass8/addons,
           on MS Windows %APPDATA%\Roaming\GRASS8\addons.

       GRASS_ADDON_ETC
           [libgis, g.findetc]
           specify paths where support files (etc/) may be found external to standard distribution.

       GRASS_COMPATIBILITY_TEST
           [libgis]
           By default it is not possible to run C modules with a libgis that has a different GIS_H_VERSION,  the
           compatibility  test  will  exit  with  a  fatal  error.  Setting  this  variable  to  0  (zero)  with
           GRASS_COMPATIBILITY_TEST=0 allows the test to be passed with a warning.

       GRASS_COMPRESSOR
           [libraster]
           the compression method for new raster maps can be set with the environment variable GRASS_COMPRESSOR.
           Supported methods are RLE, ZLIB, LZ4, BZIP2, and ZSTD. The default is ZSTD  if  available,  otherwise
           ZLIB,  which  can  be  changed with e.g.  GRASS_COMPRESSOR=ZSTD, granted that GRASS has been compiled
           with the requested compressor. Compressors that are always available are  RLE,  ZLIB,  and  LZ4.  The
           compressors BZIP2 and ZSTD must be enabled when configuring GRASS for compilation.

       GRASS_CONFIG_DIR
           [grass startup script]
           specifies  root  path  for GRASS configuration directory.  If not specified, the default placement of
           the configuration directory is used: $HOME on GNU/Linux, $HOME/Library on Mac OS X, and %APPDATA%  on
           MS Windows.

       GRASS_DB_ENCODING
           [various modules, wxGUI]
           encoding for vector attribute data (utf-8, ascii, iso8859-1, koi8-r)

       GIS_ERROR_LOG
           If  set,  GIS_ERROR_LOG  should  be  the  absolute  path  to  the  log  file (a relative path will be
           interpreted relative to the process’ cwd, not the cwd at the point the user set the variable). If not
           set, $HOME/GIS_ERROR_LOG is used instead. The file will only be used if it already exists.

       GRASS_ERROR_MAIL
           set to any value to send user mail on an  error  or  warning  that  happens  while  stderr  is  being
           redirected.

       GRASS_FONT
           [display drivers]
           specifies  the  font  as  either the name of a font from $GISBASE/etc/fontcap (or alternative fontcap
           file specified by GRASS_FONT_CAP), or alternatively the full path to a FreeType font file.

       GRASS_ENCODING
           [display drivers]
           the encoding to be assumed for text which is drawn using a freetype font; may be any encoding know to
           <u>iconv</u>.

       GRASS_FONT_CAP
           [g.mkfontcap, d.font, display drivers]
           specifies an alternative location (to $GISBASE/etc/fontcap) for the font configuration file.

       GRASS_FULL_OPTION_NAMES
           [parser]
           Generates a warning if GRASS_FULL_OPTION_NAMES is set (to anything) and a  found  string  is  not  an
           exact match for the given string.

       GRASS_GUI
           either  text  (text  user  interface),  gtext  (text  user interface with GUI welcome screen), or gui
           (graphical user interface) to define non-/graphical startup. Can also specify the name of the GUI  to
           use,  e.g.  wxpython  (<u>wxGUI</u>).  Also  exists  as  a  GRASS gisenv variable (see below). If this shell
           variable exists at GRASS startup, it will determine the GUI used. If it is not defined  startup  will
           default to the last GUI used.

       GRASS_HTML_BROWSER
           [init.sh, wxgui]
           defines  name  of  HTML browser. For most platforms this should be an executable in your PATH, or the
           full path to an executable.
           Mac OS X runs applications differently from the CLI.  Therefore,  GRASS_HTML_BROWSER  should  be  the
           application’s  signature,  which is a domain-like name, just reversed, i.e. com.apple.Safari. To find
           an application’s signature, type the following in a Terminal (fill in the path to the application you
           are interested in, for example: /Applications/Safari.app):
               grep -A 1 "CFBundleIdentifier" <u>/path/to/application.app</u>/Contents/Info.plist
             The signature is the &lt;string&gt; following the &lt;key&gt;, without the bracketing &lt;string&gt; tags.

       GRASS_INT_ZLIB
           [libraster]
           if the environment variable GRASS_INT_ZLIB exists and has the value 0, new compressed  <u>integer</u>  (CELL
           type) raster maps will be compressed using RLE compression.
           If  the variable doesn’t exist, or the value is non-zero, zlib compression will be used instead. Such
           rasters will have a compressed value of 2 in the cellhd file.
           Obviously, decompression is  controlled  by  the  raster’s  compressed  value,  not  the  environment
           variable.

       GRASS_ZLIB_LEVEL
           [libgis]
           if  the  environment  variable  GRASS_ZLIB_LEVEL exists and its value can be parsed as an integer, it
           determines the compression level used when new compressed  raster  maps  are  compressed  using  zlib
           compression. This applies to all raster map types (CELL, FCELL, DCELL).
           Valid  zlib  compression  levels are -1 to 9. The GRASS_ZLIB_LEVEL=-1 corresponds to the zlib default
           value (equivalent to GRASS_ZLIB_LEVEL=6). Often GRASS_ZLIB_LEVEL=1 gives the best compromise  between
           speed and compression.
           If  the  variable  doesn’t  exist,  or  the  value  cannot  be  parsed  as an integer, zlib’s default
           compression level 6 will be used.

       GRASS_MESSAGE_FORMAT
           [various modules, wxGUI]
           it may be set to either

           •   standard - sets percentage output and message formatting style to standard formatting,

           •   gui - sets percentage output and message formatting style to GUI formatting,

           •   silent - disables percentage output and error messages,

           •   plain - sets percentage output and message formatting style to  ASCII  output  without  rewinding
               control characters.

       GRASS_MOUSE_BUTTON
           [various modules]
           swaps mouse buttons for two-button or left-handed mice. Its value has three digits 1, 2, and 3, which
           represent  default  left, middle, and right buttons respectively. Setting to 132 will swap middle and
           right buttons. Note that this variable should be set before a display driver  is  initialized  (e.g.,
           d.mon x0).

       GRASS_PAGER
           [various modules]
           it may be set to either less, more, or cat.

       GRASS_PERL
           [used during install process for generating man pages]
           set Perl with path.

       GRASS_PROXY
           [used  during  addon  install/reinstall process for generating man pages (download commit from GitHub
           API server and remote modules.xml file)]
           set the proxy with: GRASS_PROXY="http=&lt;value&gt;,ftp=&lt;value&gt;".

       GRASS_SKIP_MAPSET_OWNER_CHECK
           By default it is not possible to work with MAPSETs that are not owned by current user.  Setting  this
           variable to any non-empty value allows the check to be skipped.

       GRASS_SH
           [shell scripts on Windows]
           path to bourne shell interpreter used to run shell scripts.

       GRASS_SIGSEGV_ON_ERROR
           Raise SIGSEGV if an error occurs]
           This  variable  can  be  set  for  debugging  purpose.  The  call  of  G_fatal_error()  will end in a
           segmentation violation. GDB can be used to trace the source of the error.

       GRASS_PYTHON
           [wxGUI, Python Ctypes]
           set to override Python executable.
           On Mac OS X this should be the pythonw executable for the wxGUI to work.

       GRASS_VECTOR_LOWMEM
           [vectorlib]
           If the environment variable GRASS_VECTOR_LOWMEM exists,  memory  consumption  will  be  reduced  when
           building vector topology support structures. Recommended for creating large vectors.

       GRASS_VECTOR_OGR
           [vectorlib, v.external.out]
           If   the   environment   variable  GRASS_VECTOR_OGR  exists  and  vector  output  format  defined  by
           <u>v.external.out</u> is PostgreSQL, vector data is written by OGR data provider  even  the  native  PostGIS
           data provider is available.

       GRASS_VECTOR_EXTERNAL_IMMEDIATE
           [vectorlib, v.external.out]
           If  the  environment variable GRASS_VECTOR_EXTERNAL_IMMEDIATE exists and vector output format defined
           by  <u>v.external.out</u>  is  non-native,  vector  features  are  written  to  output  external  datasource
           immediately.  By  default,  the vector library writes output data to a temporary vector map in native
           format and when closing the map, the features are transferred to output external datasource. Note: if
           output vector format  is  topological  PostGIS  format,  then  the  vector  library  writes  features
           immediately to output database (in this case GRASS_VECTOR_EXTERNAL_IMMEDIATE is ignored).

       GRASS_VECTOR_EXTERNAL_IGNORE
           [vectorlib]
           If  the  environment  variable  GRASS_VECTOR_EXTERNAL_IGNORE  exists, output vector format defined by
           <u>v.external.out</u> is ignored. The format is always native.

       GRASS_VECTOR_TEMPORARY
           [vectorlib]
           If the environment variable GRASS_VECTOR_TEMPORARY exists,  GRASS  vector  library  will  operate  on
           temporary   vector   maps.   New   vector   maps   will   be  created  in  temporary  directory  (see
           GRASS_VECTOR_TMPDIR_MAPSET variable), existing vector maps will be read (if  found)  also  from  this
           directory. It may be set to either:

           •   keep - the temporary vector map is not deleted when closing the map.

           •   move - the temporary vector map is moved to the current mapset when closing the map.

           •   delete - the temporary vector map is deleted when closing the map.
       Default  value is keep.  Note that temporary vector maps are not visible to the user via <u>g.list</u> or <u>wxGUI</u>.
       They are used internally by the GRASS modules and deleted automatically when GRASS session is quited.

       GRASS_VECTOR_TMPDIR_MAPSET
           [vectorlib]
           By  default  GRASS  temporary  directory   is   located   in   $LOCATION/$MAPSET/.tmp/$HOSTNAME.   If
           GRASS_VECTOR_TMPDIR_MAPSET is set to ’0’, the temporary directory is located in TMPDIR (environmental
           variable defined by the user or GRASS initialization script if not given).
           Important  note:  This variable is currently used only in vector library. In other words the variable
           is ignored by raster or raster3d library.

       GRASS_VECTOR_TOPO_DEBUG
           [vectorlib, v.generalize]
           If the environment variable GRASS_VECTOR_TOPO_DEBUG exists, <u>v.generalize</u> runs in extremely slow debug
           mode.

       GRASS_WXBUNDLED
           [wxGUI]
           set to tell wxGUI that a bundled wxPython will be used.
           When set, the wxGUI will not check the wxPython version, as this  function  is  incompatible  with  a
           bundled  wxPython.   It  is  up  to  the  packager to make sure that a compatible wxPython version is
           bundled.

       GRASS_WXVERSION
           [wxGUI]
           set to tell wxGUI which version of wxPython to use.
           When set, the wxGUI will select the given wxPython version. It’s useful  when  multiple  versions  of
           wxPython are installed and the user wants to run wxGUI with non-default wxPython version.

       GRASS_XTERM
           [lib/init/grass-xterm-wrapper, lib/init/grass-xterm-mac]
           set  to  any value (e.g. rxvt, aterm, gnome-terminal, konsole) to substitute ’x-terminal-emulator’ or
           ’xterm’. The Mac OS X app startup  defaults  to  an  internal  ’$GISBASE/etc/grass-xterm-mac’,  which
           emulates the necessary xterm functionality in Terminal.app.

       GRASS_UI_TERM
           set to any value to use the terminal based parser.

       GRASS_VERSION
           reports the current version number (used by R-stats interface etc); should not be changed by user.

       GRASS_NO_GLX_PBUFFERS
           [nviz]
           set to any value to disable the use of GLX Pbuffers.

       GRASS_NO_GLX_PIXMAPS
           [nviz]
           Set to any value to disable the use of GLX Pixmaps.

       OMP_NUM_THREADS
           [OpenMP]
           If  OpenMP support is enabled this limits the number of threads.  The default is set to the number of
           CPUs on the system.  Setting to ’1’ effectively disables parallel processing.

       TMPDIR, TEMP, TMP
           [Various GRASS GIS commands and wxGUI]
           The default wxGUI temporary directory is chosen from a platform-dependent  list,  but  the  user  can
           control  the  selection  of  this  directory  by  setting  one of the TMPDIR, TEMP or TMP environment
           variables Hence the wxGUI uses $TMPDIR if it is set, then $TEMP, otherwise /tmp.

   <b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>GRASS</b> <b>environment</b> <b>variables</b> <b>for</b> <b>rendering</b>
       [ In addition to those which are understood by specific <u>GRASS</u> <u>display</u> <u>drivers</u>,  the  following  variables
       affect rendering. ]

       GRASS_RENDER_IMMEDIATE
           tells the display library which driver to use; possible values: <u>cairo</u>, <u>png</u>, <u>ps</u>, <u>html</u> or <u>default</u>.
           Default display driver is <u>cairo</u> (if available) otherwise <u>png</u>.

       GRASS_RENDER_WIDTH
           defines the width of output image (default is 640).

       GRASS_RENDER_HEIGHT
           defines the height of output image (default is 480).

       GRASS_RENDER_FILE
           the name of the resulting image file.

       GRASS_RENDER_FRAME
           contains  4  coordinates, <u>top,bottom,left,right</u> (pixel values) with respect to the top left corner of
           the output image, defining the initial frame.

       GRASS_RENDER_LINE_WIDTH
           defines default line width.

       GRASS_RENDER_TEXT_SIZE
           defines default text size.

       GRASS_RENDER_COMMAND
           external command called by display library to render data (see example in <u>display</u>  <u>drivers</u>  page  for
           details).
           Currently only Python scripts are supported.  For specific driver-related variables see:

           •   <u>Cairo</u> <u>display</u> <u>driver</u>

           •   <u>PNG</u> <u>display</u> <u>driver</u>

           •   <u>PS</u> <u>(Postscript)</u> <u>display</u> <u>driver</u>

           •   <u>HTML</u> <u>display</u> <u>driver</u>

   <b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>internal</b> <b>GRASS</b> <b>environment</b> <b>variables</b>
       [  These  variables  are intended <b>for</b> <b>internal</b> <b>use</b> <b>only</b> by the GRASS software to facilitate communication
       between the GIS engine, GRASS scripts, and the GUI.  The user should not set these in  a  GRASS  session.
       They are meant to be set locally for specific commands. ]

       GRASS_OVERWRITE
           [all modules]
           toggles map overwrite.

           •   0 - maps are protected (default),

           •   1 - maps with identical names will be overwritten.
       This  variable  is  automatically created by <u>g.parser</u> so that the --overwrite option will be inherited by
       dependent modules as the script runs. Setting either the  GRASS_OVERWRITE  environment  variable  or  the
       OVERWRITE gisenv variable detailed below will cause maps with identical names to be overwritten.

       GRASS_VERBOSE
           [all modules]
           toggles verbosity level

           •   -1 - complete silence (also errors and warnings are discarded)

           •   0 - only errors and warnings are printed

           •   1 - progress and important messages are printed (percent complete)

           •   2 - all module messages are printed

           •   3 - additional verbose messages are printed
       This  variable  is  automatically  created  by  <u>g.parser</u>  so  that the --verbose or --quiet flags will be
       inherited by dependent modules as the script runs.

       GRASS_REGION
           [libgis]
           override region settings, separate parameters with a ";". Format is the same as in  the  WIND  region
           settings file. Otherwise use is the same as WIND_OVERRIDE.

       WIND_OVERRIDE
           [libgis]
           it causes programs to use the specified named region (created with e.g. g.region save=...) to be used
           as the current region, instead of the region from the WIND file.
           This  allows  programs such as the GUI to run external commands on an alternate region without having
           to modify the WIND file then change it back afterwards.

           sets level of debug message output for <u>wxGUI</u> (0: no debug messages, 1-5 debug levels)

       GISDBASE
           initial database

       GIS_LOCK
           lock ID to prevent parallel GRASS use,
           process id of the start-up shell script

       GUI
           See GRASS_GUI environmental variable for details.

       LOCATION
           full path to project (previously called location) directory

       LOCATION_NAME
           initial project name

       MAPSET
           initial mapset

       MEMORYMB
           [entire GRASS with focus on raster related data processing]
           sets the maximum memory to be used (in MB), i.e. the cache size for raster rows
           # set to 6 GB (default: 300 MB)
           g.gisenv set="MEMORYMB=6000"

       NPROCS
           sets the number of threads for parallel computing
           # set to use 12 threads (default: 1)
           g.gisenv set="NPROCS=12"

       OVERWRITE
           [all modules]
           toggles map overwrite.

           •   0 - maps are protected (default),

           •   1 - maps with identical names will be overwritten.
       This variable is automatically created by <u>g.parser</u> so that the --overwrite option will  be  inherited  by
       dependent  modules  as  the  script  runs. Setting either the GRASS_OVERWRITE environment variable or the
       OVERWRITE gisenv variable detailed below will cause maps with identical names to be overwritten.
