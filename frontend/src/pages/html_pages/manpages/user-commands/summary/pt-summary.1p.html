</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pt-summary - Summarize system information nicely.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: pt-summary

       pt-summary conveniently summarizes the status and configuration of a server.  It is not a tuning tool or
       diagnosis tool.  It produces a report that is easy to diff and can be pasted into emails without losing
       the formatting.  This tool works well on many types of Unix systems.

       Download and run:

          wget <a href="http://percona.com/get/pt-summary">http://percona.com/get/pt-summary</a>
          bash ./pt-summary

</pre><h4><b>RISKS</b></h4><pre>
       Percona Toolkit is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested, but all database tools can pose a
       risk to the system and the database server.  Before using this tool, please:

       •   Read the tool's documentation

       •   Review the tool's known "BUGS"

       •   Test the tool on a non-production server

       •   Backup your production server and verify the backups

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pt-summary  runs a large variety of commands to inspect system status and configuration, saves the output
       into files in a temporary directory, and then runs Unix commands on these results to format them  nicely.
       It  works  best  when executed as a privileged user, but will also work without privileges, although some
       output might not be possible to generate without root.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       Many of the outputs from this tool are deliberately rounded to show their magnitude  but  not  the  exact
       detail. This is called fuzzy-rounding. The idea is that it doesn't matter whether a particular counter is
       918  or  921; such a small variation is insignificant, and only makes the output hard to compare to other
       servers. Fuzzy-rounding rounds in larger increments as the input grows. It  begins  by  rounding  to  the
       nearest 5, then the nearest 10, nearest 25, and then repeats by a factor of 10 larger (50, 100, 250), and
       so on, as the input grows.

       The  following  is  a  simple  report  generated from a CentOS virtual machine, broken into sections with
       commentary following each section. Some  long  lines  are  reformatted  for  clarity  when  reading  this
       documentation as a manual page in a terminal.

       This section shows the current date and time, and a synopsis of the server and operating system.

        # Processor ##################################################

              Speeds | 1x2510.626

       This section is derived from <u><a href="file:/proc/cpuinfo">/proc/cpuinfo</a></u>.

        # Memory #####################################################
               Total | 503.2M
                Free | 29.0M
                Used | physical = 474.2M, swap allocated = 1.0M,
                       swap used = 16.0k, virtual = 474.3M

         Locator  Size  Speed    Form Factor  Type    Type Detail
         =======  ====  =====    ===========  ====    ===========

       Information  about  memory  is  gathered  from  "free".  The Used statistic is the total of the rss sizes
       displayed by "ps". The Dirty statistic for the cached value  comes  from  <u><a href="file:/proc/meminfo">/proc/meminfo</a></u>.  On  Linux,  the
       swappiness  settings  are  gathered  from  "sysctl".  The final portion of this section is a table of the
       DIMMs, which comes from "dmidecode". In this example there is no output.

        # Mounted Filesystems ########################################
          Filesystem                       Size Used Type  Opts Mountpoint
          /dev/mapper/VolGroup00-LogVol00   15G  17% ext3  rw   /

       The mounted filesystem section is a combination of information from "mount" and  "df".  This  section  is
       skipped if you disable "--summarize-mounts".

        # Disk Schedulers And Queue Size #############################
                dm-0 | UNREADABLE
                dm-1 | UNREADABLE
                 hdc | [cfq] 128
                 md0 | UNREADABLE
                 sda | [cfq] 128

       The disk scheduler information is extracted from the <u><a href="file:/sys">/sys</a></u> filesystem in Linux.

        # Disk Partitioning ############################################
        Device       Type      Start        End               Size

        /dev/sda2    Part         14       2088        17059230720

       Information about disk partitioning comes from "fdisk -l".

        # Kernel Inode State #########################################
        dentry-state | 10697 8559  45 0  0  0
             file-nr | 960   0  50539
            inode-nr | 14059 8139

       These  lines  are from the files of the same name in the <u><a href="file:/proc/sys/fs">/proc/sys/fs</a></u> directory on Linux. Read the "proc"
       man page to learn about the meaning of these files on your system.

        # LVM Volumes ################################################

        LogVol00 VolGroup00 -wi-ao 269.00G
        LogVol01 VolGroup00 -wi-ao   9.75G

       This section shows the output of "lvs".

        # RAID Controller ############################################
          Controller | No RAID controller detected

       The tool can detect a variety of RAID controllers by examining "lspci" and "dmesg"  information.  If  the
       controller  software  is installed on the system, in many cases it is able to execute status commands and
       show a summary of the RAID controller's status and configuration. If your system is not supported, please
       file a bug report.

        # Network Config #############################################
          Controller | Intel Corporation 82540EM Gigabit Ethernet Controller
         FIN Timeout | 60
          Port Range | 61000

       The network  controllers  attached  to  the  system  are  detected  from  "lspci".  The  TCP/IP  protocol
       configuration  parameters  are  extracted  from  "sysctl".  You  can  skip  this section by disabling the
       "--summarize-network" option.

        # Interface Statistics #######################################
        interface rx_bytes rx_packets rx_errors tx_bytes tx_packets tx_errors
        ========= ======== ========== ========= ======== ========== =========

       Interface statistics are gathered from "ip -s link" and are fuzzy-rounded. The columns are  received  and
       transmitted bytes, packets, and errors.  You can skip this section by disabling the "--summarize-network"
       option.

        # Network Connections ########################################
          Connections from remote IP addresses
            127.0.0.1           2
          Connections to local IP addresses
            127.0.0.1           2
          Connections to top 10 local ports
            38346               1
            60875               1

            ESTABLISHED         5
            LISTEN              8

       This section shows a summary of network connections, retrieved from "netstat" and "fuzzy-rounded" to make
       them  easier  to  compare  when  the  numbers  grow  large.   There are two sub-sections showing how many
       connections there are per origin and destination IP address, and a sub-section showing the count of ports
       in use.  The section ends with the count of the network connections' states.  You can skip  this  section
       by disabling the "--summarize-network" option.

       This section shows the first few lines of "top" so that you can see what processes are actively using CPU
       time.   The  notable processes include the SSH daemon and any process whose out-of-memory-killer priority
       is set to 17. You can skip this section by disabling the "--summarize-processes" option.
