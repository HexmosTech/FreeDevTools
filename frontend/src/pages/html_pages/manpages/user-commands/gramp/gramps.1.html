</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Gramps is a Free, Open Source  genealogy  program.   It  is  written  in  Python,  using  the  GTK+/GNOME
       interface.   Gramps  should  seem familiar to anyone who has used other genealogy programs before such as
       Family Tree Maker™, Personal Ancestral Files™,  or  the  GNU  Geneweb.   It  supports  importing  of  the
       ever-popular GEDCOM format which is used worldwide by almost all other genealogy software.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gramps</b> <u>FILE</u>
              When  <u>FILE</u>  is  given  (without  any  flags)  as  a  family tree name or as a family tree database
              directory, then it is opened and an interactive session is started.  If  <u>FILE</u>  is  a  file  format
              understood  by  Gramps,  an empty family tree is created whose name is based on the <u>FILE</u> name, and
              the data is imported into it.  Any other options are ignored.  This way of launching  is  suitable
              for  using  gramps  as  a handler for genealogical data in e.g. web browsers.  This invocation can
              accept any data format native to gramps; see below.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--format=</b><u>FORMAT</u>
              Explicitly specify format of <u>FILE</u> given by preceding <b>-i</b> or <b>-e</b> option.  If the  <b>-f</b>  option  is  not
              given for any <u>FILE</u>, the format of that file is guessed according to its extension or MIME type.

              Formats  available  for export are <b>gramps-xml</b> (guessed if <u>FILE</u> ends with <u>.gramps</u>), <b>gedcom</b> (guessed
              if <u>FILE</u> ends with <u>.ged</u>), or any file export available through the Gramps plugin system.

              Formats available for import are <b>gramps-xml</b>, <b>gedcom</b>, <b>gramps-pkg</b> (guessed if <u>FILE</u> ends with <u>.gpkg</u>),
              and <b>geneweb</b> (guessed if <u>FILE</u> ends with <u>.gw</u>).

              Formats available for export are <b>gramps-xml</b>, <b>gedcom</b>, <b>gramps-pkg</b>, <b>wft</b> (guessed if  <u>FILE</u>  ends  with
              <u>.wft</u>), <b>geneweb</b>.

       <b>-l</b>     Print a list of known family trees.

       <b>-L</b>     Print a detailed list of known family trees.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--force-unlock</b>
              Unlock a locked database.

       <b>-O,</b> <b>--open=</b><u>DATABASE</u>
              Open  <u>DATABASE</u>  which  must be an existing database directory or existing family tree name.  If no
              action, import, or export options are given on the command line, then an  interactive  session  is
              started using that database.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--import=</b><u>FILE</u>
              Import  data  from  <u>FILE</u>.   If no database was specified, then an empty database is created called
              Family Tree <u>x</u> (where <u>x</u> is an incrementing number).

              When more than one input file is given, each has to be preceded by  a  <b>-i</b>  flag.   The  files  are
              imported  in  the  specified  order,  e.g.,  <b>-i</b> <u>FILE1</u> <b>-i</b> <u>FILE2</u> and <b>-i</b> <u>FILE2</u> <b>-i</b> <u>FILE1</u> might produce
              different gramps IDs in the resulting database.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--export=</b><u>FILE</u>
              Export data into <u>FILE</u>.  For <b>gramps-xml</b>, <b>gedcom</b>, <b>wft</b>, <b>gramps-pkg</b>, and <b>geneweb</b>, the <u>FILE</u> is the name
              of the resulting file.

              When more than one output file is given, each has to be preceded by a  <b>-e</b>  flag.   The  files  are
              written one by one, in the specified order.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--action=</b><u>ACTION</u>
              Perform  <u>ACTION</u>  on the imported data.  This is done after all imports are successfully completed.
              Currently  available  actions  are  <b>summary</b>  (same  as  Reports→View→Summary),  <b>check</b>   (same   as
              Tools→Database  Processing→Check  and  Repair), <b>report</b> (generates report), and tool (runs a plugin
              tool).  Both <b>report</b> and <b>tool</b> need the <u>OPTION-STRING</u> supplied by the <b>-p</b> flag).

              The <u>OPTION-STRING</u> should satisfy the following conditions:

              • It should not contain any spaces.

              • If some arguments need to include spaces, the string should be enclosed  with  quotation  marks,
                following shell syntax.

              • The option string is a list of pairs with name and value (separated by an equals sign).

              • The name and value pairs must be separated by commas.

              Most of the report or tools options are specific for each report or tool.  However, there are some
              common options.

              <b>name=</b><u>name</u>
                     This  mandatory  option  determines which report or tool will be run.  If the supplied <u>name</u>
                     does not correspond to any available report or tool,  an  error  message  will  be  printed
                     followed by the list of available reports or tools (depending on the <u>ACTION</u>).

              <b>show=all</b>
                     This will produce the list of names for all options available for a given report or tool.

              <b>show=</b><u>optionname</u>
                     This  will  print  the  description of the functionality supplied by <u>optionname</u>, as well as
                     what are the acceptable types and values for this option.

              Use the above options to find out everything about a given report.

              When more than one output action is given, each has to be preceded by a <b>-a</b> flag.  The actions  are
              performed one by one, in the specified order.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug=</b><u>LOGGER_NAME</u>
              Enable debug logs for development and testing.  Look at the source code for details.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the version number of gramps and then exits.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  first argument on the command line does not start with dash (i.e., no flag), gramps will attempt
       to open the file with the name given by the first argument and start an interactive session, ignoring the
       rest of the command line arguments.

       If the <b>-O</b> flag is given, then gramps will try opening the supplied database and then work with that data,
       as instructed by the further command line parameters.

       With or without the <b>-O</b> flag, further imports, exports, and actions may be specified on the  command  line
       by using <b>-i</b>, <b>-e</b>, and <b>-a</b> flags.

       The  order  of <b>-i</b>, <b>-e</b>, or <b>-a</b> options does not matter.  The actual order they are processed always is: all
       imports (if any) → all actions (if any) → all exports (if any).  But opening must always be first!

       If no <b>-O</b> or <b>-i</b> option is given, gramps will launch its  main  window  and  start  the  usual  interactive
       session with an empty database, since there is no data to process anyway.

       If  no  <b>-e</b>  or  <b>-a</b>  options are given, gramps will launch its main window and start the usual interactive
       session with the database resulting from all imports.  This database resides in the <u>import_db.grdb</u>  under
       the <u><a href="file:~/.gramps/import">~/.gramps/import</a></u> directory.

       Any  errors  encountered  during  import, export, or action will be dumped either to <u>stdout</u> (if these are
       exceptions handled by gramps) or to <u>stderr</u> (if these are not handled).  Use usual shell  redirections  of
       <u>stdout</u> and <u>stderr</u> to save messages and errors to files.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To open an existing family tree and import an xml file into it, one may type:

          gramps -O 'My Family Tree' -i <a href="file:~/db3.gramps">~/db3.gramps</a>

       The  above changes the opened family tree. To do the same, but import both in a temporary family tree and
       start an interactive session, one may type:

          gramps -i 'My Family Tree' -i <a href="file:~/db3.gramps">~/db3.gramps</a>

       To import four databases (whose formats can be determined from their names) and then check the  resulting
       database for errors, one may type:

          gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.tgz -i <a href="file:~/db3.gramps">~/db3.gramps</a> -i file4.wft -a check

       To explicitly specify the formats in the above example, append filenames with appropriate <b>-f</b> options:

          gramps -i file1.ged -f gedcom -i file2.tgz -f gramps-pkg \
          -i <a href="file:~/db3.gramps">~/db3.gramps</a> -f gramps-xml -i file4.wft -f wft -a check

       To  record  the  database  resulting  from all imports, supply a <b>-e</b> flag (use <b>-f</b> if the filename does not
       allow gramps to guess the format):

          gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.tgz -e <a href="file:~/new-package">~/new-package</a> -f gramps-pkg

       To import three databases and start an interactive gramps session with the result:

          gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.tgz -i <a href="file:~/db3.gramps">~/db3.gramps</a>

       To run the Verify tool from the commandline and output the result to <u>stdout</u>:

          gramps -O 'My Family Tree' -a tool -p name= verify

       Finally, to start a normal interactive session type:

          gramps

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The program checks whether these environment variables are set:

       <b>LANG</b>   Describe which language to use.  E.g., for the Polish language this variable  has  to  be  set  to
              <u>pl_PL.UTF-8</u>.

       <b>GRAMPSHOME</b>
              Force  Gramps  to  use  the  specified  directory  to  keep program settings and databases in.  By
              default, this variable is not set and gramps assumes  that  the  folder  with  all  databases  and
              profile  settings  should  be  created  within  the  user profile folder (described by environment
              variable <u>HOME</u> for Linux or <u>USERPROFILE</u> for Windows 2000/XP).

       <b>CONCEPTS</b>
              Supports a python-based plugin system, allowing import  and  export  writers,  report  generators,
              tools, and display filters to be added without modification of the main program.

              In  addition  to  generating  direct  printer  output,  report generators also target other output
              formats, such as <u>LibreOffice</u>, <u>AbiWord</u>, <u>HTML</u>, or <u>LaTeX</u> to allow the users to modify the  format  to
              suit their needs.
