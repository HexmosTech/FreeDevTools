</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       a2crd - attempts the conversion of lyrics file into chordii input

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>a2crd</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] [<u>FILE</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>a2crd</b>  reads  the lyrics of one songs from a file, and attempts to produce a output suitable for <b>chordii</b>.
       Chord names can appear above or below the lyrics.  <b>a2crd</b> will embed those names into the lyrics.

       The FAQ list of alt.guitar documents the way a ascii file should look, but this format is not  recognized
       by  everyone,  or  fully  enforced. Thus, it is impossible to modify <b>chordii</b> itself to read *any* type of
       ascii input and produce good result. <b>a2crd</b> tries its best to to do the tedious conversion job.

       <b>a2crd</b> attempts to recognize mail/news headers, and comments  them  out.  It  preserves  as  is  any  line
       starting with a '{', which would indicates a <b>chordii</b> command. It also preserves any lines starting with a
       '#'.

       <b>a2crd</b> prepends to the output the content of a file called $HOME/.a2crdsig, if it exists.

       The first line that is not a comment is assumed to be the title of the song. The nest lines until a blank
       one are assumed to be subtitles.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-r</b> <u>RATIO</u>
               Sets  the  threshold  for  chordii  line  recognition.  <b>a2crd</b> looks at every line. If the ratio (
               space_characters / non-space_characters) is greater than <u>RATIO</u>, the line will be recognized as  a
               <b>chordii</b>  line,  and  its content will be merge with the next available text line. The <u>RATIO</u> has a
               initial value of 1. It is defined as a floating precision value.

       <b>-D</b>      Prints debugging information. For programmers only.

       <b>-o</b> <u>FILE</u> Sends output to <u>FILE</u>.
