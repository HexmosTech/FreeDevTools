</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lynx - a general purpose distributed information browser for the World Wide Web

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lynx</b> <u>[options]</u> <u>[optional</u> <u>paths</u> <u>or</u> <u>URLs]</u>

       <b>lynx</b> <u>[options]</u> <u>[path</u> <u>or</u> <u>URL]</u> <b>-get_data</b>
       <u>data</u>
       <b>--</b>

       <b>lynx</b> <u>[options]</u> <u>[path</u> <u>or</u> <u>URL]</u> <b>-post_data</b>
       <u>data</u>
       <b>--</b>

       Use “lynx -help” to display a complete list of current options.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Lynx</u> is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running cursor-addressable, character-cell
       display  devices (e.g., vt100 terminals, vt100 emulators running on Windows or any POSIX platform, or any
       other “curses-oriented” display).  It will display hypertext markup language (HTML) documents  containing
       links  to files residing on the local system, as well as files residing on remote systems running Gopher,
       HTTP, FTP, WAIS, and NNTP servers.

       <u>Lynx</u> has been ported to many systems, including all variants of Unix, Windows  (since  Windows  95),  DOS
       DJGPP and OS/2, as well as VMS and OS/390.

       <u>Lynx</u>  can  be  used to access information on the World Wide Web, or to build information systems intended
       primarily for local access.  For example, <u>Lynx</u> has been used to build  several  Campus  Wide  Information
       Systems (CWIS).  In addition, <u>Lynx</u> can be used to build systems isolated within a single LAN.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       At  start  up,  <u>Lynx</u> will load any local file or remote URL specified at the command line.  For help with
       URLs, press “<b>?</b>”  or “<b>H</b>” while running <u>Lynx</u>.  Then follow the link titled, “Help on URLs.”

       If more than one local file or remote URL is listed on the command line, <u>Lynx</u> will  open  only  the  last
       interactively.  All of the names (local files and remote URLs) are added to the <b>G)oto</b> history.

       <u>Lynx</u>  uses only long option names.  Option names can begin with double dash “--” as well, underscores and
       dashes can be intermixed in option names (in the reference below, options are shown  with  one  dash  “-”
       before them, and with underscores “_”).

       <u>Lynx</u>  provides  many  command-line  options.   Some  options require a value (string, number or keyword).
       These are noted in the reference below.  The other options set boolean values in the program.  There  are
       three  types  of  boolean  options:  set,  unset and toggle.  If no option value is given, these have the
       obvious meaning: set (to true), unset (to false), or toggle (between true/false).  For any of  these,  an
       explicit value can be given in different forms to allow for operating system constraints, e.g.,

           <b>-center:off</b>
           <b>-center=off</b>

           <b>-center-</b>
       <u>Lynx</u>  recognizes  “1”,  “+”,  “on”  and “true” for true values, and “0”, “-”, “off” and “false” for false
       values.  Other option-values are ignored.

       The default boolean, number and string option values that are compiled into <u>Lynx</u>  are  displayed  in  the
       help-message  provided  by <b>lynx</b> <b>-help</b>.  Some of those may differ according to how <u>Lynx</u> was built; see the
       help message itself for these values.  The <b>-help</b> option is  processed  in  the  third  pass  of  options-
       processing,  so  any  option which sets a value, as well as runtime configuration values are reflected in
       the help-message.

       <b>-</b>      If the argument is only “-”, then <u>Lynx</u> expects to receive the arguments from the  standard  input.
              This  is  to  allow  for  the  potentially  very long command line that can be associated with the
              <b>-get_data</b> or <b>-post_data</b> arguments (see below).  It can also be  used  to  avoid  having  sensitive
              information  in  the  invoking  command  line  (which  would be visible to other processes on most
              systems), especially when the <b>-auth</b> or <b>-pauth</b> options are used.

       <b>-accept_all_cookies</b>
              accept all cookies.

       <b>-anonymous</b>
              apply restrictions for anonymous account, see also <b>-restrictions</b>.

       <b>-assume_charset</b>=<u>MIMEname</u>
              charset for documents that do not specify it.

       <b>-assume_local_charset</b>=<u>MIMEname</u>
              charset assumed for local files, i.e., files which <u>Lynx</u> creates such as  internal  pages  for  the
              options menu.

       <b>-assume_unrec_charset</b>=<u>MIMEname</u>
              use this instead of unrecognized charsets.

       <b>-auth</b>=<u>ID</u>:<u>PASSWD</u>
              set  authorization  ID  and  password  for protected documents at startup.  Be sure to protect any
              script files which use this switch.

       <b>-base</b>  prepend a request URL comment and BASE tag to text/html outputs for <b>-source</b> dumps.

       <b>-bibhost</b>=<u>URL</u>
              specify a local bibp server (default <a href="http://bibhost/">http://bibhost/</a>).

       <b>-blink</b> forces high intensity background colors  for  color  mode,  if  available  and  supported  by  the
              terminal.   This  applies to the <b>slang</b> library (for a few terminal emulators), or to OS/2 EMX with
              <b>ncurses</b>.

       <b>-book</b>  use the bookmark page as the startfile.  The default or command line startfile is  still  set  for
              the Main screen command, and will be used if the bookmark page is unavailable or blank.

       <b>-buried_news</b>
              toggles  scanning  of  news  articles for buried references, and converts them to news links.  Not
              recommended because email addresses enclosed in angle brackets will be  converted  to  false  news
              links, and uuencoded messages can be trashed.

       <b>-cache</b>=<u>NUMBER</u>
              set the NUMBER of documents cached in memory.  The default is 10.

       <b>-case</b>  enable case-sensitive string searching.

       <b>-center</b>
              toggles center alignment in HTML TABLE.  Normally table cells are centered on the table grid.  Set
              this option “on” to disable centering.  The default is “off”.

       <b>-cfg</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
              specifies a <u>Lynx</u> configuration file other than the default lynx.cfg.

       <b>-child</b> exit on left-arrow in startfile, and disable save to disk and associated print/mail options.

       <b>-child_relaxed</b>
              exit on left-arrow in startfile, but allow save to disk and associated print/mail options.

       <b>-cmd_log</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
              write keystroke commands and related information to the specified file.

       <b>-cmd_script</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
              read  keystroke commands from the specified file.  You can use the data written using the <b>-cmd_log</b>
              option.  <u>Lynx</u> will ignore other information which the command-logging  may  have  written  to  the
              logfile.   Each  line  of  the  command  script contains either a comment beginning with “#”, or a
              keyword:

              <b>exit</b>
                 causes the script to stop, and forces <u>Lynx</u> to exit immediately.

              <b>key</b>
                 the character value, in printable form.  Cursor and other special  keys  are  given  as  names,
                 e.g.,  “Down  Arrow”.   Printable  7-bit  ASCII  codes  are given as-is, and hexadecimal values
                 represent other 8-bit codes.

              <b>set</b>
                 followed by a “name=value” allows one to override values set in the lynx.cfg or .lynxrc  files.
                 <u>Lynx</u> tries the cfg-file setting first.

       <b>-collapse_br_tags</b>
              toggles collapsing of BR tags.

       <b>-color</b> forces  color mode on, if available.  Default color control sequences which work for many terminal
              types are assumed if the terminal capability description does not specify  how  to  handle  color.
              <u>Lynx</u>  needs  to  be compiled with the <b>slang</b> library for this flag, it is equivalent to setting the
              <b>COLORTERM</b> environment variable.  (If color support is instead provided by a  color-capable  curses
              library  like  <b>ncurses</b>,  <u>Lynx</u>  relies  completely on the terminal description to determine whether
              color  mode  is  possible,  and  this  flag  is  not  needed  and  thus  unavailable.)   A   saved
              show_color=always  setting  found  in  a  .lynxrc  file  at  startup has the same effect.  A saved
              show_color=never found in .lynxrc on startup is overridden by this flag.

       <b>-connect_timeout</b>=<u>N</u>
              Sets the connection timeout, where N is given in seconds.

       <b>-cookie_file</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
              specifies a  file  to  use  to  read  cookies.   If  none  is  specified,  the  default  value  is
              <a href="file:~/.lynx_cookies">~/.lynx_cookies</a> for most systems, but <a href="file:~/cookies">~/cookies</a> for MS-DOS.

       <b>-cookie_save_file</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
              specifies  a  file to use to store cookies.  If none is specified, the value given by <b>-cookie_file</b>
              is used.

       <b>-cookies</b>
              toggles handling of Set-Cookie headers.

       <b>-core</b>  toggles forced core dumps on fatal errors.  Turn this option off to ask <u>Lynx</u> to force a core  dump
              if a fatal error occurs.

       <b>-crawl</b> with <b>-traversal,</b> output each page to a file.  with <b>-dump</b>, format output as with <b>-traversal</b>, but to
              the standard output.

       <b>-curses_pads</b>
              toggles  the  use of curses “pad” feature which supports left/right scrolling of the display.  The
              feature is normally available for curses configurations, but inactive.  To activate  it,  use  the
              “|”  character  or the LINEWRAP_TOGGLE command.  Toggling this option makes the feature altogether
              unavailable.

       <b>-debug_partial</b>
              separate incremental display stages with MessageSecs delay

       <b>-default_colors</b>
              toggles the default-colors feature which is normally set in the lynx.cfg file.

       <b>-delay</b> add DebugSecs delay after each progress-message

       <b>-display</b>=<u>DISPLAY</u>
              set the display variable for X rexec-ed programs.

       <b>-display_charset</b>=<u>MIMEname</u>
              set the charset for the terminal output.

       <b>-dont_wrap_pre</b>
              inhibit wrapping of text when <b>-dump</b>'ing and <b>-crawl</b>'ing, mark wrapped lines of &lt;pre&gt; in interactive
              session.

       <b>-dump</b>  dumps the formatted output of the default document or those  specified  on  the  command  line  to
              standard  output.   Unlike interactive mode, all documents are processed.  This can be used in the
              following way:

                  lynx <b>-dump</b> <a href="http://www.subir.com/lynx.html">http://www.subir.com/lynx.html</a>

              Files specified on the command line are formatted as HTML if their  names  end  with  one  of  the
              standard web suffixes such as “.htm” or “.html”.  Use the <b>-force_html</b> option to format files whose
              names do not follow this convention.

       <b>-editor</b>=<u>EDITOR</u>
              enable external editing, using the specified EDITOR.  (vi, ed, emacs, etc.)

       <b>-emacskeys</b>
              enable emacs-like key movement.

       <b>-enable_scrollback</b>
              toggles  compatibility with communication programs' scrollback keys (may be incompatible with some
              curses packages).

       <b>-error_file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              define a file where <u>Lynx</u> will report HTTP access codes.

       <b>-exec</b>  enable local program execution (normally not configured).

       <b>-fileversions</b>
              include all versions of files in local VMS directory listings.

       <b>-find_leaks</b>
              toggle memory leak-checking.  Normally this is not compiled-into your executable, but when it  is,
              it can be disabled for a session.

       <b>-force_empty_hrefless_a</b>
              force HREF-less “A” elements to be empty (close them as soon as they are seen).

       <b>-force_html</b>
              forces the first document to be interpreted as HTML.

              This is most useful when processing files specified on the command line which have an unrecognized
              suffix (or the suffix is associated with a non-HTML type, such as “.txt” for plain text files).

              <u>Lynx</u> recognizes these file suffixes as HTML:

                  “.ht3”,
                  “.htm”,
                  “.html3”,
                  “.html”,
                  “.htmlx”,
                  “.php3”,
                  “.php”,
                  “.phtml”,
                  “.sht”, and
                  “.shtml”.

       <b>-force_secure</b>
              toggles forcing of the secure flag for SSL cookies.

       <b>-forms_options</b>
              toggles whether the Options Menu is key-based or form-based.

       <b>-from</b>  toggles transmissions of From headers.

       <b>-ftp</b>   disable ftp access.

       <b>-get_data</b>
              properly formatted data for a <u>get</u> form are read in from the standard input and passed to the form.
              Input is terminated by a line that starts with “---”.

              <u>Lynx</u>  issues an HTTP <b>GET</b>, sending the form to the path or URL given on the command-line and prints
              the response of the server.  If no path or URL is given, <u>Lynx</u> sends the form to the start-page.

       <b>-head</b>  send a HEAD request for the mime headers.

       <b>-help</b>  print the <u>Lynx</u> command syntax usage message, and exit.

       <b>-hiddenlinks=[option]</b>
              control the display of hidden links.

              <b>merge</b>
                 hidden links show up as bracketed numbers and are numbered together with  other  links  in  the
                 sequence of their occurrence in the document.

              <b>listonly</b>
                 hidden links are shown only on <b>L)ist</b> screens and listings generated by <b>-dump</b> or from the <b>P)rint</b>
                 menu, but appear separately at the end of those lists.  This is the default behavior.

              <b>ignore</b>
                 hidden links do not appear even in listings.

       <b>-historical</b>
              toggles use of “&gt;” or “--&gt;” as a terminator for comments.

       <b>-homepage</b>=<u>URL</u>
              set homepage separate from start page.

       <b>-image_links</b>
              toggles inclusion of links for all images.

       <b>-index</b>=<u>URL</u>
              set the default index file to the specified URL.

       <b>-ismap</b> toggles inclusion of ISMAP links when client-side MAPs are present.

       <b>-justify</b>
              do justification of text.

       <b>-link</b>=<u>NUMBER</u>
              starting count for lnk#.dat files produced by <b>-crawl</b>.

       <b>-list_inline</b>
              for <b>-dump</b>, show the links inline with the text.

       <b>-listonly</b>
              for <b>-dump</b>, show only the list of links.

       <b>-localhost</b>
              disable URLs that point to remote hosts.

       <b>-locexec</b>
              enable  local  program  execution from local files only (if <u>Lynx</u> was compiled with local execution
              enabled).

       <b>-lss</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
              specify filename containing color-style information.  The default is lynx.lss.   If  you  give  an
              empty  filename,  <u>Lynx</u>  uses  a  built-in  monochrome  scheme  which  imitates the non-color-style
              configuration.

       <b>-mime_header</b>
              prints the MIME header of a fetched document along with its source.

       <b>-nobrowse</b>
              disable directory browsing.

       <b>-nocc</b>  disable Cc: prompts for self copies of mailings.  Note that this does not disable  any  CCs  which
              are incorporated within a mailto URL or form ACTION.

       <b>-nocolor</b>
              force  color  mode off, overriding terminal capabilities and any -color flags, COLORTERM variable,
              and saved .lynxrc settings.

       <b>-noexec</b>
              disable local program execution.  (DEFAULT)

       <b>-nofilereferer</b>
              disable transmissions of Referer headers for file URLs.

              This flag is not available on all systems, <u>Lynx</u> needs to be compiled with HAVE_SIGACTION  defined.
              If available, this flag <u>may</u> cause <u>Lynx</u> to react more immediately to window changes when run within
              an <b>xterm</b>.

       <b>-nonumbers</b>
              disable link- and field-numbering.  This overrides <b>-number_fields</b> and <b>-number_links</b>.

              <u>Lynx</u> issues an HTTP <b>POST</b>, sending the form to the path or URL given on the command-line and prints
              the response of the server.  If no path or URL is given, <u>Lynx</u> sends the form to the start-page.

       <b>-preparsed</b>
              show HTML source preparsed and reformatted when used with <b>-source</b> or in source view.

              Sets the read-timeout, where N is given in seconds.

       <b>-reload</b>
              flushes the cache on a proxy server  (only  the  first  document  given  on  the  command-line  is
              affected).

       <b>-restrictions</b>=<u>[option][,option][,option]...</u>
              allows  a list of services to be disabled selectively.  Dashes and underscores in option names can
              be intermixed.  The following list is printed if no options are specified.

              resumes session from specified file.

       <b>-sessionout</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
              saves session to specified file.

       <b>-short_url</b>
              show  very  long  URLs  in  the  status  line  with “...” to represent the portion which cannot be
              displayed.  The beginning and end of the URL are displayed, rather than suppressing the end.

       <b>-show_cfg</b>
              Print the configuration settings, e.g., as read from “lynx.cfg”, and exit.

       <b>-show_cursor</b>
              If enabled the cursor will not be hidden in the right hand corner but will instead  be  positioned
              at  the  start  of  the  currently  selected link.  Show cursor is the default for systems without
              FANCY_CURSES capabilities.  The default configuration can be changed in  userdefs.h  or  lynx.cfg.
              The command line switch toggles the default.

       <b>-show_rate</b>
              If  enabled  the  transfer rate is shown in bytes/second.  If disabled, no transfer rate is shown.
              Use lynx.cfg or the options menu to select KB/second and/or ETA.

       <b>-socks5_proxy=URL</b>
              (Via which) SOCKS5 proxy to connect: any network traffic, including all DNS  resolutions  but  the
              one  for  URL  itself,  will  be  redirected  through  the  SOCKS5  proxy.   URL  may  be given as
              “proxy.example.com”, “proxy.example.com:1080”,  “192.168.0.1”,  or  “192.168.0.1:1080”  (and  IPv6
              notation  if  so  supported).   A  SOCKS5 proxy may also be specified via the environment variable
              <b>SOCKS5_PROXY</b>.  This option controls the builtin SOCKS5 support, which is unrelated to  the  option
              <b>-nosocks</b>.

       <b>-soft_dquotes</b>
              toggles  emulation  of  the  old  Netscape and Mosaic bug which treated “&gt;” as a co-terminator for
              double-quotes and tags.

       <b>-source</b>
              works the same as dump but outputs HTML source instead of formatted text.  For example

                  lynx -source . &gt;foo.html

              generates HTML source listing the files in the current directory.  Each file is marked by an  HREF
              relative to the parent directory.  Add a trailing slash to make the HREF's relative to the current
              directory:

                  lynx -source ./ &gt;foo.html

       <b>-stack_dump</b>
              disable SIGINT cleanup handler

       <b>-startfile_ok</b>
              allow non-http startfile and homepage with <b>-validate</b>.

       <b>-stderr</b>
              When  dumping  a  document  using  <b>-dump</b>  or <b>-source</b>, <u>Lynx</u> normally does not display alert (error)
              messages that you see on the screen in the status line.  Use the <b>-stderr</b> option to  tell  <u>Lynx</u>  to
              write these messages to the standard error.

       <b>-stdin</b> read the startfile from standard input (UNIX only).

       <b>-syslog</b>=<u>text</u>
              information for syslog call.

       <b>-syslog_urls</b>
              log requested URLs with syslog.

       <b>-tagsoup</b>
              initialize parser, using Tag Soup DTD rather than SortaSGML.

       <b>-telnet</b>
              disable recognition of telnet commands.

       <b>-term</b>=<u>TERM</u>
              tell  <u>Lynx</u>  what  terminal  type  to  assume  it  is  talking  to.  (This may be useful for remote
              execution, when, for example, <u>Lynx</u> connects to a remote TCP/IP port that starts a script that,  in
              turn, starts another <u>Lynx</u> process.)

       <b>-timeout</b>=<u>N</u>
              For win32, sets the network read-timeout, where N is given in seconds.

       <b>-tlog</b>  toggles between using a <u>Lynx</u> Trace Log and stderr for trace output from the session.

       <b>-tna</b>   turns on “Textfields Need Activation” mode.

       <b>-trace</b> turns on <u>Lynx</u> trace mode.  Destination of trace output depends on -tlog.

       <b>-trace_mask</b>=<u>value</u>
              turn  on  optional traces, which may result in very large trace files.  Logically OR the values to
              combine options:

              <b>1</b>  SGML character parsing states

              <b>2</b>  color-style

              <b>4</b>  TRST (table layout)

              <b>8</b>  configuration (lynx.cfg, .lynxrc, .lynx-keymaps, mime.types and mailcap contents)

              <b>16</b> binary string copy/append, used in form data construction.

              <b>32</b> cookies

              <b>64</b> character sets

              <b>128</b>
                 GridText parsing

              <b>256</b>
                 timing

              <b>512</b>
                 detailed URL parsing

       <b>-traversal</b>
              traverse all http links derived from startfile.  When used with <b>-crawl</b>, each link that begins with
              the same string as startfile is output to a file, intended for indexing.

              See CRAWL.announce for more information.

       <b>-trim_blank_lines</b>
              toggles trimming of trailing blank lines as well as the related  trimming  of  blank  lines  while
              collapsing BR tags.

       <b>-trim_input_fields</b>
              trim input text/textarea fields in forms.

       <b>-underline_links</b>
              toggles use of underline/bold attribute for links.

       <b>-underscore</b>
              toggles use of _underline_ format in dumps.

       <b>-unique_urls</b>
              check for duplicate link numbers in each page and corresponding lists, and reuse the original link
              number.

       <b>-update_term_title</b>
              enables  updating  the  title  in terminal emulators.  Use only if your terminal emulator supports
              that escape code.  Has no effect when used with <b>-notitle</b>.

       <b>-use_mouse</b>
              turn on mouse support, if available.  Clicking the left mouse  button  on  a  link  traverses  it.
              Clicking  the  right  mouse  button  pops back.  Click on the top line to scroll up.  Click on the
              bottom line to scroll down.  The first few positions  in  the  top  and  bottom  line  may  invoke
              additional  functions.   <u>Lynx</u>  must be compiled with <b>ncurses</b> or <b>slang</b> to support this feature.  If
              <b>ncurses</b> is used, clicking the middle mouse button pops up a simple menu.  Mouse  clicks  may  only
              work reliably while <u>Lynx</u> is idle waiting for input.

       <b>-useragent=Name</b>
              set alternate <u>Lynx</u> User-Agent header.

       <b>-validate</b>
              accept only http URLs (for validation).  Complete security restrictions also are implemented.

       <b>-verbose</b>
              toggle [LINK], [IMAGE] and [INLINE] comments with filenames of these images.

       <b>-version</b>
              print version information, and exit.

       <b>-vikeys</b>
              enable vi-like key movement.

       <b>-wdebug</b>
              enable  Waterloo tcp/ip packet debug (print to watt debugfile).  This applies only to DOS versions
              compiled with WATTCP or WATT-32.

       <b>-width</b>=<u>NUMBER</u>
              number of columns for formatting of dumps, default is 80.   This  is  limited  by  the  number  of
              columns that <u>Lynx</u> could display, typically 1024 (the <u>MAX_LINE</u> symbol).

       <b>-with_backspaces</b>
              emit backspaces in output if <b>-dump</b>'ing or <b>-crawl</b>'ing (like <b>man</b> does)

       <b>-xhtml_parsing</b>
              tells  <u>Lynx</u>  that  it can ignore certain tags which have no content in an XHTML 1.0 document.  For
              example “&lt;p/&gt;” will be discarded.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       More than one key can be mapped to a given command.  Here are some of the most useful:

       •   Use <b>Up</b> <b>arrow</b> and <b>Down</b> <b>arrow</b> to scroll through hypertext links.

       •   <b>Right</b> <b>arrow</b> or <b>Return</b> will follow a highlighted hypertext link.

       •   <b>Left</b> <b>Arrow</b> or “<b>u</b>” will retreat from a link.

       •   Type “<b>H</b>”, “<b>?</b>”, or <b>F1</b> for online help and descriptions of key-stroke commands.

       •   Type “<b>k</b>” or “<b>K</b>” for a list of the current key-stroke command mappings.

           If the same command is mapped to the same letter differing only by upper/lowercase only the lowercase
           mapping is shown.

       •   Type <b>Delete</b> to view history list.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to various “standard” environment variables such as <b>DISPLAY</b>, <b>HOME</b>, <b>PATH</b>, <b>SHELL</b>, <b>TMPDIR</b>, <b>USER</b>,
       etc., <u>Lynx</u> utilizes several <u>Lynx</u>-specific environment variables, if they exist.

       Others may be created or modified by <u>Lynx</u> to pass data to an external  program,  or  for  other  reasons.
       These are listed separately below.

       See also the sections on <b>SIMULATED</b> <b>CGI</b> <b>SUPPORT</b> and <b>NATIVE</b> <b>LANGUAGE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b>, below.

       Note:   Not  all environment variables apply to all types of platforms supported by <u>Lynx</u>, though most do.
       Feedback on platform dependencies is solicited.

       Environment Variables Used By <u>Lynx</u>:

       <b>COLORTERM</b>           If set, color capability for the terminal is forced on at startup time.   The  actual
                           value  assigned to the variable is ignored.  This variable is only meaningful if <u>Lynx</u>
                           was built using the <b>slang</b> screen-handling library.

       <b>LYNX_CFG</b>            This variable, if set, will override the default location  and  name  of  the  global
                           configuration  file  (normally,  <b>lynx.cfg</b>)  that  was  defined  by  the LYNX_CFG_FILE
                           constant in the userdefs.h file, during installation.

                           See the userdefs.h file for more information.

       <b>LYNX_CFG_PATH</b>       If set, this variable overrides the compiled-in search-list of  directories  used  to
                           find  the  configuration  files,  e.g., <b>lynx.cfg</b> and <b>lynx.lss</b>.  The list is delimited
                           with ":" (or ";" for Windows) like the <b>PATH</b> environment variable.

       <b>LYNX_HELPFILE</b>       If set, this variable overrides the compiled-in URL and configuration  file  URL  for
                           the <u>Lynx</u> help file.

       <b>LYNX_LOCALEDIR</b>      If  set,  this  variable  overrides  the compiled-in location of the locale directory
                           which contains native language (NLS) message text.

       <b>LYNX_LSS</b>            This variable, if set, specifies the location of the  default  <u>Lynx</u>  character  style
                           sheet  file.   [Currently  only meaningful if <u>Lynx</u> was built using curses color style
                           support.]

       <b>LYNX_SAVE_SPACE</b>     This variable, if set, will override the default path prefix for files saved to  disk
                           that is defined in the <b>lynx.cfg</b> <b>SAVE_SPACE:</b> statement.

                           See the <b>lynx.cfg</b> file for more information.

       <b>LYNX_TEMP_SPACE</b>     This variable, if set, will override the default path prefix for temporary files that
                           was  defined  during  installation,  as well as any value that may be assigned to the
                           <b>TMPDIR</b> variable.

       <b>MAIL</b>                This variable specifies the default inbox <u>Lynx</u> will  check  for  new  mail,  if  such
                           checking is enabled in the <b>lynx.cfg</b> file.

       <b>NEWS_ORGANIZATION</b>   This variable, if set, provides the string used in the <b>Organization:</b> header of <b>USENET</b>
                           news  postings.   It  will  override  the  setting  of  the  ORGANIZATION environment
                           variable, if it is also set (and, on <b>UNIX</b>, the contents of an /etc/organization file,
                           if present).

       <b>NNTPSERVER</b>          If set, this variable specifies the default NNTP server that will be used for  <b>USENET</b>
                           news reading and posting with <u>Lynx</u>, via news: URL's.

       <b>ORGANIZATION</b>        This variable, if set, provides the string used in the <b>Organization:</b> header of <b>USENET</b>
                           news  postings.  On <b>UNIX</b>, it will override the contents of an /etc/organization file,
                           if present.

       <u>PROTOCOL</u><b>_proxy</b>      <u>Lynx</u> supports the use of proxy servers that can act as firewall gateways and  caching
                           servers.   They  are preferable to the older gateway servers (see WWW_access_GATEWAY,
                           below).

                           Each protocol used by <u>Lynx</u>, (http, ftp, gopher, etc), can  be  mapped  separately  by
                           setting environment variables of the form <u>PROTOCOL</u>_proxy.  Protocols are indicated in
                           a  URI  by  the  name  before “:”, e.g., “http” in “<a href="http://some.server.dom">http://some.server.dom</a>:port/” for
                           HTML.

                           Depending on your system  configuration  and  supported  protocols,  the  environment
                           variables recognized by <u>lynx</u> may include

                               cso_proxy
                               finger_proxy
                               ftp_proxy
                               gopher_proxy
                               http_proxy
                               https_proxy
                               news_proxy
                               newspost_proxy
                               newsreply_proxy
                               nntp_proxy
                               no_proxy
                               rlogin_proxy
                               snews_proxy
                               snewspost_proxy
                               snewsreply_proxy
                               telnet_proxy
                               tn3270_proxy
                               wais_proxy

                           See <b>Lynx</b> <b>Users</b> <b>Guide</b> for additional details and examples.

       <b>RL_CLCOPY_CMD</b>       Pipe the contents of the current link using this command as the target.

       <b>RL_PASTE_CMD</b>        Open  a pipe to read from this command, pasting it into the current editable-field or
                           command-prompt.

       <b>SOCKS5_PROXY</b>        Is inspected if <b>-socks5_proxy</b> has not been used (for the same content).

       <b>SSL_CERT_DIR</b>        Set to the directory containing trusted certificates.

       <b>SSL_CERT_FILE</b>       Set to the full path and filename for your file of trusted certificates.

       <b>WWW_</b><u>access</u><b>_GATEWAY</b>  <u>Lynx</u>  still  supports  use  of  gateway  servers,  with  the  servers  specified  via
                           “WWW_<u>access</u>_GATEWAY”  variables  (where  “<u>access</u>”  is  lower  case and can be “http”,
                           “ftp”, “gopher” or “wais”).  However most gateway  servers  have  been  discontinued.
                           Note  that  you  do  not  include  a  terminal  “/”  for gateways, but do for proxies
                           specified by <u>PROTOCOL</u>_proxy environment variables.

                           See <b>Lynx</b> <b>Users</b> <b>Guide</b> for details.

       <b>WWW_HOME</b>            This variable, if set, will override the default startup URL specified in any of  the
                           <u>Lynx</u> configuration files.

       Environment Variables <b>Set</b> or <b>Modified</b> By <u>Lynx</u>:

       <b>LYNX_PRINT_DATE</b>     This  variable  is  set by the <u>Lynx</u> p(rint) function, to the <b>Date:</b> string seen in the
                           document's “<b>Information</b> <b>about</b>” page (= cmd), if any.  It is created  for  use  by  an
                           external  program,  as  defined  in a <b>lynx.cfg</b> <b>PRINTER:</b> definition statement.  If the
                           field does not exist for the document, the variable is set to  a  null  string  under
                           <b>UNIX</b>, or “No Date” under <b>VMS</b>.

       <b>LYNX_PRINT_LASTMOD</b>  This  variable  is  set by the <u>Lynx</u> p(rint) function, to the <b>Last</b> <b>Mod:</b> string seen in
                           the document's “<b>Information</b> <b>about</b>” page (= cmd), if any.  It is created for use by an
                           external program, as defined in a <b>lynx.cfg</b> <b>PRINTER:</b>  definition  statement.   If  the
                           field  does  not  exist  for the document, the variable is set to a null string under
                           <b>UNIX</b>, or “No LastMod” under <b>VMS</b>.

       <b>LYNX_PRINT_TITLE</b>    This variable is set by the <u>Lynx</u> p(rint) function, to the <b>Linkname:</b>  string  seen  in
                           the document's “<b>Information</b> <b>about</b>” page (= cmd), if any.  It is created for use by an
                           external  program,  as  defined  in a <b>lynx.cfg</b> <b>PRINTER:</b> definition statement.  If the
                           field does not exist for the document, the variable is set to  a  null  string  under
                           <b>UNIX</b>, or “No Title” under <b>VMS</b>.

       <b>LYNX_PRINT_URL</b>      This  variable  is  set  by the <u>Lynx</u> p(rint) function, to the <b>URL:</b> string seen in the
                           document's “<b>Information</b> <b>about</b>” page (= cmd), if any.  It is created  for  use  by  an
                           external  program,  as  defined  in a <b>lynx.cfg</b> <b>PRINTER:</b> definition statement.  If the
                           field does not exist for the document, the variable is set to  a  null  string  under
                           <b>UNIX</b>, or “No URL” under <b>VMS</b>.

       <b>LYNX_TRACE</b>          If set, causes <u>Lynx</u> to write a trace file as if the <b>-trace</b> option were supplied.

       <b>LYNX_TRACE_FILE</b>     If  set, overrides the compiled-in name of the trace file, which is either <b>Lynx.trace</b>
                           or <b>LY-TRACE.LOG</b> (the latter on the DOS/Windows platforms).   The  trace  file  is  in
                           either case relative to the home directory.

       <b>LYNX_VERSION</b>        This  variable  is  always  set  by  <u>Lynx</u>,  and may be used by an external program to
                           determine if it was invoked by <u>Lynx</u>.

                           See also the comments in the distribution's sample <b>mailcap</b> file, for notes  on  usage
                           in such a file.

       <b>TERM</b>                Normally,  this variable is used by <u>Lynx</u> to determine the terminal type being used to
                           invoke <u>Lynx</u>.  If, however, it is unset at startup time (or has the value  “unknown”),
                           or  if  the  <b>-term</b> command-line option is used (see <b>OPTIONS</b> section above), <u>Lynx</u> will
                           set or modify its value to the user specified terminal type (for the  <u>Lynx</u>  execution
                           environment).   Note: If set/modified by <u>Lynx</u>, the values of the <b>LINES</b> and/or <b>COLUMNS</b>
                           environment variables may also be changed.

   <b>Simulated</b> <b>CGI</b> <b>Support</b>
       If built with the <b>cgi-links</b> option enabled, <u>Lynx</u> allows access to a cgi script directly without the  need
       for an http daemon.

       When  executing  such “lynxcgi scripts” (if enabled), the following variables may be set for simulating a
       CGI environment:

       <b>CONTENT_LENGTH</b>

       <b>CONTENT_TYPE</b>

       <b>DOCUMENT_ROOT</b>

       <b>HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET</b>

       <b>HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE</b>

       <b>HTTP_USER_AGENT</b>

       <b>PATH_INFO</b>

       <b>PATH_TRANSLATED</b>

       <b>QUERY_STRING</b>

       <b>REMOTE_ADDR</b>

       <b>REMOTE_HOST</b>

       <b>REQUEST_METHOD</b>

       <b>SERVER_SOFTWARE</b>

       Other  environment  variables  are  not  inherited  by  the  script,  unless  they  are  provided  via  a
       LYNXCGI_ENVIRONMENT  statement in the configuration file.  See the <b>lynx.cfg</b> file, and the (draft) CGI 1.1
       Specification &lt;<a href="http://Web.Golux.Com/coar/cgi/draft-coar-cgi-v11-00.txt">http://Web.Golux.Com/coar/cgi/draft-coar-cgi-v11-00.txt</a>&gt; for the definition and  usage  of
       these variables.

       The CGI Specification, and other associated documentation, should be consulted for general information on
       CGI script programming.

   <b>Native</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Support</b>
       If  configured and installed with <b>Native</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Support</b>, <u>Lynx</u> will display status and other messages in
       your local language.  See the file <b>ABOUT_NLS</b> in the source distribution, or at your local <b>GNU</b>  site,  for
       more information about internationalization.

       The following environment variables may be used to alter default settings:

       <b>LANG</b>                This  variable, if set, will override the default message language.  It is an <b>ISO</b> <b>639</b>
                           two-letter code identifying the language.  Language codes are <b>NOT</b>  the  same  as  the
                           country codes given in <b>ISO</b> <b>3166</b>.

       <b>LANGUAGE</b>            This  variable,  if  set,  will override the default message language.  This is a <b>GNU</b>
                           extension that has higher priority for setting  the  message  catalog  than  <b>LANG</b>  or
                           <b>LC_ALL</b>.

       <b>LC_ALL</b>              and

       <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>         These  variables,  if  set,  specify  the notion of native language formatting style.
                           They are <b>POSIXly</b> correct.

       <b>LINGUAS</b>             This variable, if set prior to  configuration,  limits  the  installed  languages  to
                           specific values.  It is a space-separated list of two-letter codes.  Currently, it is
                           hard-coded to a wish list.

       <b>NLSPATH</b>             This variable, if set, is used as the path prefix for message catalogs.

   <b>Acknowledgments</b>
       <u>Lynx</u>  has  incorporated  code  from  a  variety  of sources along the way.  The earliest versions of <u>Lynx</u>
       included code from Earl Fogel of Computing Services at the University of  Saskatchewan,  who  implemented
       HYPERREZ  in  the Unix environment.  HYPERREZ was developed by Niel Larson of Think.com and served as the
       model for the early versions of <u>Lynx</u>.  Those versions also incorporated libraries from  the  Unix  Gopher
       clients  developed  at the University of Minnesota, and the later versions of <u>Lynx</u> rely on the WWW client
       library code developed by Tim Berners-Lee and the  WWW  community.   Also  a  special  thanks  to  Foteos
       Macrides who ported much of <u>Lynx</u> to VMS and did or organized most of its development since the departures
       of  Lou  Montulli  and  Garrett  Blythe  from  the University of Kansas in the summer of 1994 through the
       release of v2.7.2, and to everyone on the net who has contributed to <u>Lynx</u>'s development  either  directly
       (through  patches,  comments  or bug reports) or indirectly (through inspiration and development of other
       systems).
