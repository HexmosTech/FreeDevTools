</pre><h4><b>NAME:</b></h4><pre>
       Ripit  - Perl script to create flac, ogg, mp3, m4a (aac), als (mp4), mpc, wv or other files from an audio
       CD.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS:</b></h4><pre>
       ripit [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION:</b></h4><pre>
       This Perl script makes it a lot easier to extract and compress sound files from an audio CD  or  a  local
       directory  with  wav/flac  files.  Although  Ripit  ensures exact copy of the digital data with different
       verification possibilities, it aims to enhance the audio content  for  a  more  userfriendly  experience.
       Tracks  can  be merged or partially ripped, hidden tracks (aka pregap tracks or HTOA) and ghost songs are
       detected and can be split, like all other tracks, into chunks of sound where  silence  has  been  trimmed
       away. Data tracks can be omitted to prevent ripper failure or waste of time on such tracks.

       Ripit supports Flac, Lame, Oggenc, Faac, mp4als, Musepack, Wavpack and ffmpeg. Artist and song titles are
       retrieved  either  with  the  CDDB_get.pm perl module from freedb.org or using WebService::MusicBrainz.pm
       from MusicBrainz.org. Several encoder formats and qualities or compression levels can be used in the same
       run (even the same encoder) and encoded into different directories. Distributed encoding  and  launch  of
       more than one encoder process in the same time is possible.

       Retrieval  and  different modifications of metadata is possible to ensure highly customized tagging, e.g.
       adding coverart, detection of Various Artists style at different levels  of  strictness  or  album  gain,
       freedom  to  add  any kind of personal tags and change of encoding format for tags used in mp3.  External
       commands can be launched before and after ripping / encoding is done (providing access  to  all  internal
       variables   containing   metadata),   e.g.   to  ensure  presence  of  coverart  if  not  retrieved  from
       coverartarchive.org or discogs.com.

       Additional processes take care of calculation of md5sums, generation of playlist files, creation of  toc,
       cue  or inf files e.g. enableing to burn the WAV files with text and no gaps in DAO mode.  It is possible
       to submit and edit CDDB entries at freedb.org or submission of MusicBrainz data (ISRCs only)  provided  a
       login to access the MB site and of course to save this metadata locally for later use.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION:</b></h4><pre>
       Ripit Version 4.0.0

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS:</b></h4><pre>
       [track_selection]
              Tracks to rip from.  If not specified,  all tracks will be ripped. Specify a single track by using
              a  single  number,  or  a  selection of tracks using numbers separated by commas or hyphens, e. g.
              2,6,10, or 3,5,7-9.  Using a number followed by a comma or hyphen will rip from that track to  the
              end of the CD i. e. 3,5- rips track 3 and from track 5 to the last one.

              To  rip  only  audio  tracks and to skip all data tracks (trailing or even in between) the tweeked
              argument 1-a might be useful. In this case Ripit will try to detect the  number  of  audio  tracks
              using cdparanoia toc query.

              Default: not set.

       <b>--merge</b> ordered list of comma separated intervals.
              Place  a  hyphen  (-) or a plus (+) between first and last track number to be merged. Omitting the
              last number will merge all subsequent tracks.  Separate several intervals with commas. Do not  use
              this  option  to  merge  the  whole  disc  into  one  track, use option --cdcue or --book instead.
              Default: not set.

       <b>-I,</b> <b>--span</b> starttime-endtime
              Define an interval to be ripped when using cdda2wav or cdparanoia. The hyphen is  mandatory.   The
              format    of    start    and    end-time    is    according    to    cdparanoia   hh:mm:ss.ff   in
              hours/minutes/seconds/frames, but precision is set to seconds, i. e.  frames will be ignored. Zero
              fields need not be specified and the value of seconds may be larger than  60  if  no  minutes  and
              hours  are  stated. When using cdda2wav this option translates the values to the -o and -d options
              of cdda2wav. When using option merge, end time is related to the  last  track  in  the  selection.
              Default: not set.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--outputdir</b> <u>dir</u>
              Full  path  of  <u>directory</u>  where the sound should go. If not set, $HOME will be used. Default: not
              set.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--device</b> <u>cddevice</u>
              Path of the <u>device</u> containing the audio CD, default: /dev/cdrom.

       <b>--scsidevice</b> <u>cddevice</u>
              Device name for special devices if the non ripping  commands  (except  eject  commands)  shall  be
              executed  on  a  different device node. This might be useful for some old SCSI devices. If not set
              the <u>cddevice</u> of option --device will be used. Default: not set.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--ripper</b> <u>number</u>
              CD ripper to use, <u>0</u> - dagrab, <u>1</u>  -  cdparanoia,  <u>2</u>  -  cdda2wav,  <u>3</u>  -  rip  (Morituri)  (breaking
              parallelism,  experimental),  <u>4</u>  -  cdd  (support  not ensured).  When data tracks are encountered
              because special track selection 1-a has not been used,  cdparanoia  and  dagrab  are  supposed  to
              immediately  fail and therefore allow Ripit to create an error.log so that the encoder process can
              terminate if problems were encountered.  This  might  not  be  the  case  depending  the  type  of
              "copyprotection"  is  used  and  on  the other hand it could be that cdd2wav may fail on such data
              tracks and enables Ripit  to  continue  to  rip  and  encode  without  endless  looping.  Use  the
              appropriate  ripper  according  to  your  needs and switch the ripper if needed or use the special
              track selection to omit data tracks.

              Note when using rip (Morituri)  alle  directories  must  be  defined  with  option  --dirtemplate,
              including a separate wav directory which will be created by rip (Morituri). Further inconveniences
              might  be  due  to  the  programs  limitations  and its recent development activity with behaviour
              changing almost dayly, breaking every wrappers capabilities.

              Default: <u>1</u> - cdparanoia.

       <b>--ripopt</b> <u>options</u>
              User definable <u>options</u> for specific ripper. Quote them if necessary. Note that changing the ripper
              implies to update this option. Default: not set.

       <b>--offset</b> <u>number</u>
              User definable sample offset for the CD ripper. This will trigger option -O when using  cdparanoia
              and  option -o when using rip (Morituri).  Icedax (cdda2wav) seems not to provide a sample offset.
              Default: not set.

       <b>-Q,</b> <b>--accuracy</b> number
              Check ripped files at AccurateRip using Morituri (rip) which must be installed. One might need  to
              specify a sample offset (see option --offset) to achieve accuracy. Default: off.

       <b>-Y,</b> <b>--verify</b> <u>number</u>
              When  using  cdparanoia rip track <u>number</u> times until md5sum for 2 rips match, maximum tries is the
              number given as argument, default: 1, i.e. no checks will be done.

       <b>--nicerip</b> <u>number</u>
              Set niceness of ripping process, default: 0.

       <b>-Z,</b> <b>--disable-paranoia</b> [<u>number</u>]
              When using dagrab, the number of retries will be set to 3, with cdparanoia this option is equal to
              the <b>-Z</b> option of cdparanoia.  The <u>number</u> can be set to <u>0</u> (paranoia on), to <u>1</u> (paranoia off) or  to
              <u>2</u>  to  switch  paranoia off if a track fails or gets a timeout. Ripit will retry that failed track
              without paranoia or give up.  Ripping will then continue with paranoia on. Default: 0 ‐ off, i. e.
              use paranoia mode.

       <b>--ghost</b>
              Analyze each wav for gaps and split it into chunks if gaps are detected and/or try to  trim  lead-
              in/out.  This  may  override  option merge. Delete blank tracks if only silence ("zero bytes") are
              found. Experimental!  Default: off.

       <b>--extend</b> <u>seconds</u>
              When using option <b>--ghost</b> and only if a chunk of sound is detected, enlarge  chunk  by  amount  of
              <u>seconds</u>  at  end if possible (no silence will be added), or track may be trimmed if value is small
              (e.g. 0.3), use with caution. Default: 2.0.

       <b>--prepend</b> <u>seconds</u>
              When using option <b>--ghost</b> and only if a chunk of sound is detected, enlarge  chunk  by  amount  of
              <u>seconds</u>  at beginning, if possible (no silence will be added), or track may be trimmed if value is
              small (e.g. 0.3), use with caution. Default: 2.0.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--coder</b> <u>number</u>
              Encoder(s) to use, <u>0</u> - Lame (for mp3), <u>1</u> - Oggenc, <u>2</u> - Flac, <u>3</u> - Faac, <u>4</u> - mp4als, <u>5</u> - Musepack, <u>6</u>
              - Wavpack, <u>7</u> - ffmpeg, a comma separated list, or as an array. The same encoder may be stated more
              than once, but different output-directories must be specified (to prevent overwriting  files  with
              identical  path)  stating  the  <b>--dirtemplate</b>  for each encoder or using the $quality parameter in
              option <b>--dirtemplate</b> or stating the <b>--tracktemplate</b> for each encoder. See below.  Default: <u>0</u>.

       <b>--faacopt</b> Faac-options
              Pass other options to the encoder. If the same encoder has been stated more than once, use a comma
              separated list. Do not use this option for compression level, use option --quality instead.  Quote
              them with double quotes if needed; default: not set.

       <b>--flacopt</b> Flac-options
              Pass other options to the encoder. If the same encoder has been stated more than once, use a comma
              separated  list. Do not use this option for compression level, use option --quality instead. Quote
              them with double quotes if needed; default: not set.

       <b>--flacdecopt</b> Flac decoding options
              Additional options for flac when used to decode flac  files.  Might  be  needed  to  force  (over)
              writing existing wav files: Default: -s (silent).

       <b>--lameopt</b> Lame-options
              Pass other options to the encoder. If the same encoder has been stated more than once, use a comma
              separated  list.  Do not use this option for quality settings, use option --quality instead. Quote
              them with double quotes if needed; default: not set.

       <b>--museopt</b> Musepack-options
              Pass other options to the encoder. If the same encoder has been stated more than once, use a comma
              separated list. Do not use this option for quality settings, use option --quality  instead.  Quote
              them with double quotes if needed; default: not set.

       <b>--musenc</b> Musepack-encoder
              Choose Musepack encoder to be used, either mpcenc or mppenc for older versions; default: mpcenc.

       <b>--mp4opt</b> Mp4als-options
              Pass other options to the encoder. Option -MP4 of encoder mp4als is mandatory to enable tagging of
              sound files. Use the appropriate options to alter compression level and speed. If the same encoder
              has  been  stated  more  than  once,  use a comma separated list. Quote them with double quotes if
              needed; default: not set.

       <b>--oggencopt</b> Oggenc-options
              Pass other options to the encoder. If the same encoder has been stated more than once, use a comma
              separated list. Do not use this option for quality settings, use option --quality  instead.  Quote
              them with double quotes if needed; default: not set.

       <b>--wavpackopt</b> Wavpack-options
              Pass other options to the encoder. If the same encoder has been stated more than once, use a comma
              separated list. Quote them with double quotes if needed; default: not set.

       <b>--ffmpegopt</b> ffmpeg-options
              Pass  other  options  to  the  encoder.  If the ffmpeg has been stated more than once, use a comma
              separated list. Quote them with double quotes if needed; default: not set.

       <b>--ffmpegsuffix</b> ffmpeg-suffix
              The suffix of the formats to be encoded. If ffmpeg has been stated more than  once,  use  a  comma
              separated list. Quote them with double quotes if needed; default: not set.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quality</b> <u>quality</u>
              A  comma  separated  list  of  <u>values</u>  or  the word "off", passed in the same order as the list of
              encoders. If no encoders passed, follow the order of the config file. This options name  might  be
              misleading  as  lossless encoders do not have a quality but a <u>compression</u> level instead. Depending
              the encoder it refers, this option means: quality for oggenc: (1-10), highest  =  10;  compression
              level  for Flac: (0-8), lowest (but fastest) compression = 0; quality for Lame in vbr mode: (0-9),
              best quality = 0; or quality for Faac: (10-500), highest = 500; mp4als seems  not  to  accept  any
              compression  level,  set  to  zero;  quality  for  Musepack:  (0-10),  best quality = 10; default:
              5,3,5,100,0,5. Wavpack and ffmpeg have no quality switch, use encoder options instead.  The  value
              "off"  turns  option  quality  off,  if supported by the encoder.  Encoders that need a quality or
              compression level will use default value in case "off" is used.
              E. g. <b>--coder</b> 2,0,1,3 <b>--quality</b> 3,4,5,300 sets compression level for Flac to 3, Lame-quality to 4,
              Oggenc-quality to 5 and Faac quality to 300.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--vbrmode</b> <u>mode</u>
              Option vbrmode defines variable-bitrate, only used with Lame, the mode is either <u>new</u> or  <u>old</u>,  see
              the Lame manpage. The Lame-option quality will be changed to <b>-V</b> instead of <b>-q</b> if vbr-mode is used;
              default: not set.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--bitrate</b> <u>rate</u>
              Encode  "mp3"  at  this  bitrate  for  Lame.  If option <b>--vbrmode</b> used, bitrate is equal to the <b>-b</b>
              option, so one might want to set it "off"; or set if "off" if all options are passed to --lameopt.
              Default: 128.

       <b>-B,</b> <b>--maxrate</b> <u>rate</u>
              Option maxrate (bitrate) for Lame when using <b>--vbrmode</b> is translated to the <b>-B</b> option in  Lame  or
              the <b>-M</b> option in Oggenc, default: 0.

       <b>-S,</b> <b>--preset</b> <u>mode</u>
              Use  the  preset  switch  when  encoding with Lame. Combined with option <b>--vbrmode</b> <b>new</b> the "preset
              fast" setting will be used.  Use <b>--vbrmode</b> <b>old</b> not to use fast VBR. Mode is  one  of:  <u>insane</u> (<u>320</u>
              kbps  @  CBR),  <u>extreme</u> (<u>256</u>  kbps),  <u>standard</u> (<u>192</u>  kbps) or <u>medium</u> (<u>160</u> kbps) or any other valid
              bitrate. Default: off.

       <b>-W,</b> <b>--chars</b> [<u>list</u>]
              Exclude special characters in file names and path. The argument is optional. The argument  accepts
              a <u>list</u> of any characters. One might escape the characters or use double quotes to pass them on the
              command line. The argument also accepts the presets <u>NTFS</u>, <u>HFS</u> or <u>off</u>. Following characters will be
              erased,  if  no  argument  stated  or  the word NTFS is passed: |\:*?$  plus blanks and periods at
              beginning and end of file names and directories. When using the word  HFS,  only  colons  will  be
              purged  plus blanks and periods at beginning of file names and directories. Pass the word "off" as
              argument to set the option off again. Default: off.

       <b>--comment</b> <u>comment</u>
              Specify a <u>comment</u> for the comment-tag for Lame, Faac, Musepack and Wavpack, or the description-tag
              for Oggenc and Flac. The special comment <u>cddbid</u> or <u>discid</u> will place the cddbid (used  by  freedb)
              or  the  discid  (used for MusicBrainz) into the comment. See also option --mp3tags, --flactags or
              --oggtags for more special tags to be added; default: not set.

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--genre</b> <u>genre</u>
              Specify (and override CDDB) <u>genre</u>, must be a valid ID3-genre if using Lame, can (but shouldn't) be
              anything if using other encoders; default: not set.

       <b>-y,</b> <b>--year</b> <u>year</u>
              Specify (and override CDDB) the <u>year</u> of year-tag for Lame, Faac, Musepack and Wavpack or the date-
              tag for Oggenc and Flac; default: not set.

       <b>--coverart</b> <u>number</u>
              A <u>number</u> or comma separated list of <u>numbers</u> (if several encoders are  used)  according  to  option
              --coder with values 0 (no) or 1 (yes); default 0.

       <b>--coverpath</b> <u>path</u>
              Path  to  the coverart picture to be included in the metadata of the sound files. The picture must
              be present or acquired using e.g. the --precmd option to call a specific script taking care of the
              process finding coverart or option --coverorg in combination with option --mb  (see  below).  This
              option  is  mandatory  in  case  --coverart  is  used. The full path might be given with variables
              according to the --dirtemplate and using same quoting rules. Absolutely no checks about  existence
              of  path will happen and a missing path will not be created so that a wrong argument might lead to
              failed downloads when using --coverorg. No checks about existence of  coverart  will  be  done  if
              --interaction  is  set off. In case of re-encoding the variable $inputdir can be stated.  Default:
              not set.

       <b>--coverorg</b> <u>number</u>
              Retrieve coverart from coverartarchive.org using the MusicBrainz release ID (not  to  be  confused
              with  the discid, used to find the release on MusicBrainz). Furthermore as an experimental feature
              discogs.com will be used in case a discogs release ID was listed on the MusicBrainz release  page.
              But  this  might be out of order any time as discogs changes page layout frequently. If a cover is
              downloaded from coverartarchive.org all other files will get suffixes in their file names  not  to
              overwrite  any  files. Note that the --coverpath must be set to save the coverart and must reflect
              an existing path.  Possible values 0 (no) or 1 (yes), default 0.

       <b>--coversize</b> <u>format</u>
              Resize the provided coverart picture to a fix <u>value</u> according  to  ImageMagicks  convert  command,
              either  values  in  the format XXXxYYY or only a width to keep aspect ratio. The original coverart
              file will be renamed. Possible values: any valid format, default: not set.

       <b>--copycover</b> <u>path</u>
              Full path to any kind of file (e.g. the coverart  picture)  to  be  copied  into  all  directories
              containing  encoded  files. The argument might consist of variables according to the --dirtemplate
              and using same quoting rules. In case  of  re-encoding  the  variable  $inputdir  can  be  stated,
              default: not set.

       <b>--flactags</b> <u>FRAME=tag</u>
              Additional <u>tags</u> for flac not passed by the encoder to ensure evaluation of special tags similar to
              mp3tags.  Use  option  --flacopt  "--tag=FRAME=foo"  for additional hard coded tags instead.  When
              using MusicBrainz additional metadata provided can be added as tags using the scheme  FRAME=frame.
              Supported  are  ASIN,  BARCODE,  CATALOGNUMBER  (using  tag  "catalog"),  CDDID,  DGID, DISCID aka
              MUSICBRAINZ_DISCID (using tag "discid") and MBREID aka MUSICBRAINZ_ALBUMID (using tag mbreid) with
              the tag in lower case, e.g. adding an asin: --flactags=ASIN=asin will evaluate the lower case asin
              if the variable is defined. Nothing is added if the metadata is not available.  The option  is  an
              array, for each additional frame/tag to be added state the option once. Default: not set

       <b>--mp3tags</b> <u>FRAME=[DESCRIPTION]tag</u>
              Additional  tags  to be added to the mp3 file(s) if encoder does not provide options for the <u>FRAME</u>
              or if some unofficial <u>FRAME</u>s shall be used (e.g. a compilation tag set to 1: TCMP=1). This  option
              only     supports     basic     (id3v2.4)     frames     in    the    format    <u>FRAME=tag</u>    (e.g.
              WCOP=<a href="http://id3.org/id3v2.4.0-frames">http://id3.org/id3v2.4.0-frames</a>)  or  <u>FRAME=[DESCRIPTION]tag</u>  (e.g.  a  user   defined   text
              annotation  for  the description ASIN: TXXX=[ASIN]B003ZYEQ30). Note that the braces must be stated
              with some content and do not stand for optional content.  More than one --mp3tags statement can be
              used if several tags shall be added. Do not add a COMM frame here as  this  tag  is  supported  by
              (older  versions of) Lame and the corresponding option exists in Ripit. The same goes for the APIC
              frame which has its own option in Ripit. Newer versions of Lame may support this tags  using  Lame
              option --tv to be passed with Ripits option --lameopt.
              No  checks on encoding will happen on content stated here, in case option --utftag is switched off
              operator has to ensure encoding of the tags.
              Special tags will be evaluated in case the metadata is provided e.g.  when using MB and  the  TXXX
              tag.  Supported  are  ASIN,  CATALOG,  BARCODE, CDDBID, DGID, DISCID aka "MusicBrainz Disc Id" and
              MBREID aka "MusicBrainz Album Id" with the tag in lower case, e.g. --mp3tags  TXXX=[ASIN]asin will
              replace asin with the value if the variable is defined. Default: not set.

       <b>--oggtags</b> <u>FRAME=tag</u>
              Additional tags for ogg files similar to --flactags. Default: not set.

       <b>--vatag</b> <u>number</u>
              Analyze track names for "various artists" style  and  split  the  metadata  in  case  one  of  the
              delimiters  (colon,  hyphen,  slash  or  parenthesis) are found. Use unpair numbers for the scheme
              "artist ? tracktitle" and pair numbers in the opposite case. The artist will be  compared  to  the
              argument  of  option --vastring (see below).  If the artist must be like --vastring and each track
              have a delimiter, use 1 (2), if the artist must be like --vastring while only some tracks  contain
              the  delimiter, use 3 (4), if no restrictions apply for the artist but all track names must have a
              delimiter, use 5 (6) and finally, if only a few tracks contain a delimiter to be used as splitting
              point, set --vatag to 7 (8). Default: not set.

       <b>--vastring</b> <u>string</u>
              A string (regular expression) that defines the "various artists" style, e.g.  Varios|VA.  Default:
              \bVA\b|Variou*s|Various\sArtists|Soundtrack|OST

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--dirtemplate</b> '"foo <u>parameters</u>"'
              Use  single  and  double  quotes  to  pass the parameters of the templates!  Allowed are any legal
              characters, slashes  for  multi-level  directories  and  following  parameters:  <u>$album</u>,  <u>$artist</u>,
              <u>$iletter</u>, <u>$genre</u>, <u>$quality</u>, <u>$suffix</u>, <u>$trackname</u>, <u>$tracknum,</u> <u>$year</u> and <u>$trackno</u>; example: '"$suffix
              $quality/my_snd_dir/$iletter/$artist/$year  ‐  $album"'.   The  parameter  $iletter is the initial
              letter of the artist name; $trackno is the total number of tracks of the release,  this  might  be
              helpful to distinguish different releases with exactly the same name; $quality might be needed, if
              one  wants  to  encode  the same format at different qualities in the same run. Note that $quality
              reflects the encoder options and not the arguments of option  <b>--quality</b>  which  might  be  set  to
              "off".  Or  state different dirtemplates: the option is an array, so one can use several different
              dirtemplates in the same order as the encoders. If less dirtemplates than encoders are stated, the
              last dirtemplate will be used for subsequent encoders and the wav-directory, see  EXAMPLES  below,
              but  must  be  defined  for  all  formats  including  wav in case rip (Morituri) is used. Default:
              '"$artist - $album"'.

       <b>-T,</b> <b>--tracktemplate</b> '"foo <u>parameters</u>"'
              See above. The tracktemplate is not an array, only one can be stated.  Additionally it allows  two
              more  variables helpful in case VA-style is detected: <u>$trackartist,</u> <u>$tracktitle;</u> note: trackartist
              will be filled with the value of artist in case no track artist has  been  found  to  respect  the
              templates settings, and tracktitle will hold the pure trackname. Additional album-artist tags will
              be  written,  e.g.  TPE2  tag  for  Lame  and  the artist field will contain the track artist tag.
              Default: '"$tracknum $trackname"'.

       <b>--trackoffset</b> <u>number</u>
              Give a trackoffset to be added to the $tracknum variable (see above).  Might  be  useful  to  join
              multi disc releases into one directory (and to switch option --overwrite to "y"). Default: 0.

       <b>--addtrackoffset</b>
              When  using  MusicBrainz,  check  for  multi  discs  releases  and  automatically add a calculated
              --trackoffset to the track counter. Ripit will try to detect already ripped  multi  disc  releases
              and  temporarily  switch option --overwrite to "y" in case the first track of a multi disc release
              is not present in an existing directory corresponding to the dirtemplate.
              Negate to switch option off again. Default: not set.

       <b>--discno</b> <u>number</u>
              Set a counter for the disc when using a multi disc release.  This option accepts any integer; when
              using MB and --discno is set to 1 the discnumber will be set to the discnumber  according  to  the
              presented data (read as: switch option on). Using a number &gt; 1 will force this number and will not
              be altered if MB gives a different disc number. Default: 0.

       <b>--sshlist</b> <u>list</u>
              Comma  separated  <u>list</u>  of  remote machines where Ripit should encode. The output path must be the
              same for all machines. Specify the login (login@machine) only if  not  the  same  for  the  remote
              machine. Else just state the machine names. See EXAMPLES for more information, default: not set.

       <b>--scp</b>  If  the  file  system  can not be accessed on the remote machines, scp (copy) the WAV files to the
              remote machines, default: off.

       <b>--local</b>
              Only used with option <b>--sshlist</b>; if all encoding shall be done on remote machines, use  <b>--nolocal</b>,
              default: on.

       <b>--mb</b>   Access  MusicBrainz DB via WebService::MusicBrainz module instead of freedb (see below). One needs
              the discid calculation perl module or command to be installed and in the path.  Negate  to  switch
              option off again. A non interactive freedb look-up will be done to retrieve a genre. Default: off.

       <b>--mbrels</b> <u>number</u>
              Check  each  track  for  additional  relationships, only vocal and work relationships are handled.
              Possible values 0 (no) or 1 (yes); default: 0.

       <b>--mbname</b> <u>login</u>
              Give the users MusicBrainz login name to submit ISRCs to the database.  Saved in plain when  using
              a config, default: not set.

       <b>--mbpass</b> <u>password</u>
              Give  the users MusicBrainz password to submit ISRCs to the database.  Saved in plain when using a
              config, default: not set.

       <b>--isrc</b> <u>number</u>
              Enable ISRC detection with <u>number</u> = <u>1</u> (using icedax) and  submission  to  MusicBrainz.  Note  that
              option <b>--mb</b> must be switched on. Possible values 0 (no) or 1 (yes); default: 0.

       <b>--cdtext</b> <u>numer</u>
              Check for CD text if no DB entry found, possible values 0 (no) or 1 (yes); default 0; default: 0

              CDDB  server,  either  freedb.org,  freedb2.org or musicbrainz.org.  Default freedb.org. Note, the
              full address is "mirror".freedb.org, i. e.  default is freedb.freedb.org.  Exception:  freedb2.org
              and   musicbrainz.org   have   no   mirrors,   their   full   addresses   are:   freedb2.org   and
              freedb.musicbrainz.org on port 80 (see transfer mode).

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--transfer</b> <u>mode</u>
              Transfer mode, <u>cddb</u> or <u>http</u><b>,</b> will set default port to 8880 or 80 (for http), default: cddb.  Note:
              use http mode with CDDB servers freedb2.org or musicbrainz.org.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--mirror</b> <u>mirror</u>
              Choose "freedb" or one of the possible freedb <u>mirrors</u>, default: freedb. For more information check
              the  web page www.freedb.org.  There is no list of mirrors available these days. This option might
              be obsolete as freedb uses random servers, but the default setting is mandatory.

       <b>-L,</b> <b>--protocol</b> <u>level</u>
              CDDB protocol level for CDDB query. Level = <u>6</u> supports UTF-8 and level = <u>5</u> not. Use level =  <u>5</u>  to

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--proxy</b> address
              The http proxy to use when accessing the cddb server. The CDDB protocol must be http. Default: not
              set.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--nice</b> <u>number</u>
              Set niceness of encoding process, default: 0.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--archive</b>
              Read  and/or  save CDDB files in $HOME/.cddb/"category" directory using the xmcd format, where the
              "category" is one of the 11 CDDB categories or in case MusicBrainz is used an additional  category
              "musicbrainz" will be used. Default: off.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--eject</b>
              Ejects  the  CD  when  finished, if hardware supports it. Use --noeject to switch it off. Default:
              off.

       <b>--ejectcmd</b> <u>command</u>
              <u>Command</u> to be used for ejection or loading of CD tray. Should be specified within FreeBSD even  if
              option  --eject  is not used to enable Ripit to load the CD tray. One does not need to mention the
              words close or eject or options like -t, Ripit does it. Default: eject.

       <b>--ejectopt</b> <u>options</u>
              <u>Options</u> for ejection command to be used for ejection or loading of CD tray.  Default: the path  to
              the CD device.

       <b>--halt</b> Powers off the machine when finished if configuration supports it, default: off.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--submission</b>
              Specify  <b>--nosubmission</b> if the computer is offline and the created file cddb.toc shall be saved in
              the home directory instead of being submitted. With option  <b>--archive</b> it will also be saved in the
              $HOME/.cddb directory. The purpose of this option is also to permit the user to edit the CDDB data
              for the own track names &amp; tags and not to overwrite the original CDDB entry. Default: on.

       <b>-M,</b> <b>--mail</b> <u>address</u>
              Users return email <u>address</u>, needed for submitting an entry to freedb.org. Default: not set.

       <b>--mailopt</b> <u>options</u>
              Additional <u>options</u>, added to sendmail command. The reply-to address will be used with option -r as
              defined above. Default: -t

       <b>-A,</b> <b>--book</b> <u>number</u>
              Create an audiobook file, i. e. merge all tracks into one single  file,  option  --ghost  will  be
              switched off.
              If  encoder faac is used file suffix will be m4b instead of m4a and a chapter file will be written
              for chapter marks. The installed version of faac must support the -w option to write tags.
              Note that options --wav and --cdtoc should also be switched off.  Possible values  0  (off)  or  1
              (on); default: off.

       <b>--cdcue</b> <u>number</u>
              Number  n  =  <u>1</u>  or  <u>2</u> to create cue sheets to burn the wavs with CD-Text.  The cue sheets will be
              copied to the other file formats. Number <u>1</u> will switch option --ghost on to  eliminate  chunks  of
              silence.  Number <u>2</u> is experimental but does not switch option --ghost on and may be used if number
              <u>1</u> fails.  Default: off.

       <b>--cdtoc</b> <u>number</u>
              Number n = <u>1</u> to create a toc file to burn the wavs with CD-Text using cdrdao or cdrecord. Default:
              off.

       <b>--inf</b> <u>number</u>
              Number n = <u>1</u> to create inf files to burn the wavs with CD-Text using wodim or  cdrecord.  Default:

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--playlist</b> <u>number</u>
              Create  the  m3u  playlist  file,  or  use  <b>--playlist</b>  <u>0</u>.   For  file names without full path use
              <b>--playlist</b> <u>2</u>.  Default is full path for file names. Default 1 - on.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--interaction</b>
              Specify <b>--nointeraction</b> if ripit shall take the first entry found and rip without any questioning.
              Default: on.

       <b>--lcd</b>  Use lcdproc to display status, default: not set.

       <b>--lcdhost</b>
              Specify the lcdproc host, default: localhost.

       <b>--lcdport</b>
              Specify the lcdport, default: 13666.

       <b>--infolog</b> <u>file</u>
              Log operations (system calls, file/directory creation) to <u>file</u> given with full path; default:  not
              set.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--lowercase</b> <u>number</u>
              Lowercase  file  names and or directories (from tracktemplate and dirtemplate): number n = <u>0</u>, off,
              <u>1</u>, on for file names and directories, <u>2</u>, only for file names, <u>3</u>, only  for  directories,  default:
              off.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--underscore</b>
              Use underscores (_) instead of spaces in file names, default: off.

       <b>--uppercasefirst</b>
              Uppercase  first  letter of each word in file names and tags. Use this option if the CDDB entry is
              uppercase only. Default: off.

       <b>-U,</b> <b>--utftag</b>
              Keep Lame-tags in UTF-8 or decode them (but not the file names) from UTF-8 to  ISO8859-1.  Applies
              only  to  mp3  (Lame).  May  be  useful for tags with special characters and if mp3-player doesn't
              support Unicode.  Using Musepack one might want to pass the Musepack option  --unicode  to  option
              museopt. Note that combining with options --threads (and or --sshlist) may lead to issues and must
              be regarded as experimental.  Default: off.

       <b>--rip</b>  Rip  the  CD,  to  be  used  as  --norip  if wav (or flac) files are present.  Previously used for
              debugging, may be useful to re-encode existing wav or  flac  files  in  a  given  --inputdir  (see
              below).  Option  --inputdir  is  mandatory  in case --norip is used. Default: not set.  Note: this
              option can not be defined in the config file.

       <b>--inputdir</b> <u>directory</u>
              Full path to the directory with wav or flac files to be re-encoded using option --norip. See  also
              option  --cdid  to get awereness on some unexpected behaviour. Default: not set. Note: this option
              can not be defined in the config file.

       <b>--cdid</b> <u>id</u>
              Give a freedb.ord CDDBID or a musicbrainz discid in case lookup shall be done when re-encoding wav
              or flac files and existing track names (of wavs) or tags (in flac files) should  be  updated  when
              using  --norip. If not stated, ripit will try to detect an ID in playlist, toc or log files or cue
              sheets to retrieve local or online metadata. This means: a look-up may happen even if this  option
              is  not  stated. This may lead to some unexpected effects, e.g. differing directory or track names
              from those stated in option --inputdir, new tracknumbers in case ghost songs are  present,  merged
              multi  disc  releases  and  so  on.  Default: not set. Note: this option can not be defined in the
              config file.

       <b>--encode</b>
              Do encode the wavs. If only the wav-files shall be created, prevent encoding with <b>--noencode</b>  (and
              use option <b>--wav</b>, see below). Default: on.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--wav</b>
              Keep the wav files after encoding instead of deleting them, default: off.

       <b>-N,</b> <b>--normalize</b>
              Normalizes the wave-files to a given dB-value (default: -12dB). Default: off.
              This is useful when encoding

              *  for hardware or software that doesn't support the replaygain‐feature

              *  to audio formats without replaygain capabilities.

       <b>--normcmd</b>
              Command to use for normalizing, default: normalize.

       <b>-z,</b> <b>--normopt</b>
              Options to pass to normalize.  Possible values:
                  -a -nndB   :   Normalize to -nn dB, default is -12dB,
                  Value range:   All values &lt;= 0dB
                  Example    :   normalize -a -20dB *.wav
                  -b         :   Batch mode ‐ loudness differences between
                                 individual tracks of a CD are maintained
                  -m         :   Mix mode ‐ all track are normalized to the
                                 same loudness
                  -v         :   Verbose operation
                  -q         :   Quiet operation

              For  further  options see normalize documentation (<a href="http://normalize.nongnu.org">http://normalize.nongnu.org</a>).  Please note that
              normalizing to a high dB value, e.g. -6dB or less will lead to severe  compression  of  the  audio
              signal, thus losing sound quality. Keeping the default value of -12dB is recommended.
              Default: -b Option v (q) will be set according to verbosity chosen.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>

              <u>5</u>).  Default 3.

       <b>--config</b>
              Read  parameters from config file or specify <b>--noconfig</b> to prevent reading it. A local config file
              in $HOME/.ripit/ will have higher priority, only if the local file does not exist, ripit will  try
              to read /etc/ripit/config. Default: on.

       <b>--confname</b>
              Read  parameters  from  a specific configuration file if special options are needed, this might be
              useful if operator wants different settings for discs containing  music  than  e.g.  audio  books.
              Default: config.

       <b>--confdir</b>
              Read parameters from a config file in a specific directory, default is $HOME/.ripit/.

       <b>--save</b> Add  parameters  passed  on command line to an existing config file. This does not overwrite other
              existing settings. Options of an existing config file will be adopted and the old  file  saved  as
              config.old no matter if a file named config.old already exists. Default: off.

       <b>--savenew</b>
              Save  all  parameters  passed  on  command  line  to a new config file, backup an existing file to
              config.old  no matter if a file named config.old already exists. Creates a default config file  if
              no options are passed on command line. Default: off.

       <b>--loop</b> <u>value</u>
              After  ejection of the previous CD continue ripping and encoding as soon as a new CD has been fed.
              This option forces ejection (<b>--eject</b>). The value is either <u>0</u> for normal use (single run) or <u>1</u>  for
              (standard)  looping.  Experimental value <u>2</u> might be used to force immediate restart of the ripping
              process even if encoder did not yet complete. This will spoil  the  output,  this  will  show  the
              prompt  although  a  child  process  is  running  (waiting  for  a  new CD) and must be terminated
              explicitly.
              The config file will be read out on each run just before ejection of the disc. In case one  alters
              the  config  file  after  ejection,  close  the tray with the disc already done for re-reading the
              config and re-ejection of the disc. Therefore it might  be  useful  to  pass  as  few  options  as
              possible on the CL when using option --loop, because options passed on the CL can of course not be
              alterd with the config file during a loop.
              Default: off.

       <b>--quitnodb</b> <u>value</u>
              Give  up  CD  if  no  CDDB entry found. Useful if option --loop or --nointeraction are on. Default
              behaviour is to let operator enter data or to use default artist, album and track names.  Possible
              values: 0 - off, 1 - on, default: off

       <b>--resume</b>
              Resume a previously started session. Default: off.

       <b>-O,</b> <b>--overwrite</b> <u>argument</u>
              Default  behaviour  of  Ripit  is not to overwrite existing directories, a suffix will be added if
              directory name exists. Use option overwrite to prevent this and either overwrite  a  previous  rip
              (<u>y</u>) or force Ripit to quit (<u>q</u>) or even eject the disc (<u>e</u>). If ejection is chosen, the disc will be
              ejected even if option --eject has not been switched on. Default: off (n)

       <b>--dpermission</b> <u>number</u>
              Change the directory permission to <u>number</u>. Default: 0755.

       <b>--fpermission</b> <u>number</u>
              Change the file permission to <u>number</u>. Default: 0644.

       <b>--md5sum</b>
              Create a MD5-sum file for each type of sound files.

       <b>--threads</b> <u>number</u>
              Comma  separated  list  of  numbers giving maximum of allowed encoders to run at the same time. In
              conjunction with option sshlist the number for the local machine is mandatory and must  be  stated
              first.  Default: 1.

       <b>-X,</b> <b>--execmd</b> <u>command</u>
              State  a  <u>command</u> to be executed when ripit finished. The same variables as in the dirtemplate can
              be stated. When using MusicBrainz one can try to use $cd{asin} to pass the ASIN to the command  to
              be executed. Make sure to escape the command if needed. Default: not set.

       <b>--precmd</b> <u>command</u>
              State  a  <u>command</u>  to be executed before ripping started. The same variables as in the dirtemplate
              can be stated. When using MusicBrainz one can try e.g. to use $cd{asin} to pass the  ASIN  to  the
              command  to be executed, which might be useful when executing a script to retrieve coverart from a
              site. Make sure to escape the command if needed.  Default: not set.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To specify a CD device, type

              ripit <b>--device</b> /dev/sr1

       To specify the output directory, type

              ripit <b>--outputdir</b> /foo/paths/

       To rip and encode a special track selection, type

              ripit 1,3-6,8-11

       To use several encoders in the same run, type

              ripit <b>--coder</b> 1,0,2 <b>--quality</b> 3,5,6

       In case many encoders are desired, option --threads may be handy on a multicore CPU (omitting any quality
       settings in this example)

              ripit <b>--coder</b> 0,1,2,4 <b>--threads</b> 4

       To use Lame with variable bitrate (VBR), type

              ripit <b>--vbrmode</b> new <b>--bitrate</b> 0

       Note, one should reset the <b>--bitrate</b> to 0 (zero) if the <b>-b</b> option of Lame is not  desired.  According  to
       VBR mode in Lame, use "new" or "old".

       It is recommended to use the preset switches for Lame, (see Lame man-page) and specify fast encoding with
       <b>--vbrmode</b> new (use <b>--vbrmode</b> old to switch off the fast encoding)

              ripit <b>--preset</b> extreme <b>--vbrmode</b> new

       To  pass  options related to the encoder use the according encoder option switch: e.g. to use the managed
       mode with oggenc:

              ripit <b>-c</b> 1 <b>--oggencopt</b> "--managed -b 192 -M 224 -m 96" <b>--quality</b> "off"

       Check for ghost songs and trim very long lead-in/out of each track:

              ripit <b>--ghost</b> <b>--prepend</b> 2.0 <b>--extend</b> 2.0

       Encode the same format in 2 qualities, at low quality for a portable, at high quality for home:

              ripit <b>--dirtemplate</b> '"cbr/$artist/$year ‐ $album"' \
                    <b>--dirtemplate</b> '"preset/$artist ‐ $album"' \
                    <b>--coder</b> 0,0 <b>--bitrate</b> off <b>--quality</b> off,off \
                    <b>--lameopt</b> "-b 128 -q 2,--preset extreme"

       Force Ripit to use one and the same directory for all sound files:

              ripit <b>--dirtemplate</b> '"/"' <b>--outputdir="/media/sound"</b> \
                    <b>--resume</b>

       To normalize the wave-files prior to encoding:

              ripit <b>--normalize</b>

       To normalize the files to -18dB using "mix mode" (see normalize documentation)

              ripit <b>--normalize</b> <b>--normopt</b> "-m -a -18dB"

       Add coverart retrieved from coverartarchive to the encoded files.  Note  that  instead  of  a  full  path
       ('"/home/me/$artist - $album/cover.jpg"') the evaluated internal variable $wavdir has been used to ensure
       that  the  cover  goes  to  the  right  place in case Ripit alters the $wavdir with some suffix to preven
       overwriting.

              ripit <b>--noconfig</b> <b>-d</b> /dev/cdrom <b>-r</b> 1 <b>-c</b> 2 <b>--mb</b> \
                    <b>--coverart</b> 1 <b>--coverorg</b> 1 <b>--coverpath</b> '"/$wavdir/cover.jpg"'

       Update a config file in <a href="file:~/home/.ripit/">~/home/.ripit/</a> with options: to use Lame and Oggenc, don't  create  a  m3u  file,
       archive the CDDB entry files in <a href="file:~/.cddb/">~/.cddb/</a>"category"/ and to eject CD when done, type

              ripit <b>--coder</b> 0,1 <b>--playlist</b> 0 <b>--archive</b> <b>--eject</b> <b>--save</b>

       To do the job without any interaction, type

              ripit <b>--nointeraction</b>

       Re-encode  wav  or  flac files in inputdir using a special configuration file with settings according for
       re-encoding (e.g. switched overwrite mode on and use MusicBrainz to enable detection of track-offsets)

              ripit <b>--confname</b> config_4.0.0_reenc <b>--inputdir</b> "/home/me/sound/2c - We shall see/flac" <b>--norip</b>

       Rip only first 30 seconds of each track (useful for testing)

              ripit <b>--span</b> 0-30

       To use a network for encoding, make sure that the output paths are equal on all machines.

              ripit <b>--sshlist</b> sun,saturn,earth

       where sun, saturn and earth are remote machines on which a user can login  via  ssh  without  entering  a
       password  or  passphrase!  Note that the paths must be equal for the user on all remote machines!  If the
       login is different on some machines, try

              ripit <b>--sshlist</b> login1@sun,login2@saturn,login3@earth

       If there is "no" identical path on the remote machines, then the user might enter e.g.  <a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>  as  output
       directory.  If the file-system is not mounted on each remote machine, one can try to copy the wavs to the
       remote machines using option <b>--scp</b>.

              ripit <b>--sshlist</b> sun,saturn,earth <b>--scp</b>
