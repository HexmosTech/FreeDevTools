       dput - Debian package upload tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dput</b> [-h] [-d] [-c FILE] [-D] [-e DAYS] [-F] [-f] [-l] [-U] [-o] [-O OVERRIDE] [-S UNSET] [-P] [-s] [-u]
       [-v] [-V] [HOST] CHANGES-FILE [CHANGES-FILE ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       dput-ng is a Debian package upload tool which provides an easy to use interface to Debian (like) package
       archive hosting facilities. It allows anyone who works with Debian packages to upload their work to a
       remote service, including Debian’s ftp-master, mentors.debian.net, Launchpad or other package hosting
       facilities for Debian package maintainers.

       <u>HOST</u> may optionally specify a target stanza from any configured configured profile which is selected as a
       upload target. If <u>HOST</u> is omitted a default host using the heuristic described below is selected.

       The only mandatory argument is a <u>CHANGES-FILE</u> which is interpreted as a Debian package.changes file
       denoting the desired package to be uploaded.

       Packages being uploaded already, but not processed yet can be removed later from the destination using
       <b>dcut</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c,</b> <b>--config</b>=FILE
           Configuration file to parse. This option will override all other configuration files.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug</b>
           Enable debug messages. Repeat twice to increase the verbosity level.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--dinstall</b>
           Ignored silently for compatibility with old-style dput command lines. Please use a post-upload hook
           or similar to reproduce this functionality.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--delayed</b>=DAYS
           Upload to the delayed queue, instead of the usual incoming directory. This option takes an argument
           from 0 to 15 corresponding to the respective DELAYED queue.

       <b>-F,</b> <b>--full-upload-log</b>
           Write more verbose .upload logs. When set to, upload logs will include more details. This setting
           overrides profile defaults when provided.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--force</b>
           Force an upload, even if the upload log exists already.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--lintian</b>
           Run Lintian before uploading the package. Note, this option is deprecated. Profile targets have the
           ability to properly handle invoking lintian before pushing it to the remote host, such as the
           <b>run_lintian</b> key.

               This option is a shortcut for --override "run_lintian=true"

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--check-only</b>
           Only run pre-upload checks for the package, do not actually upload. This is useful to help in testing
           new checks, or verifying the profile will work as expected.

       <b>-O,</b> <b>--override</b>=OVERRIDE
           Override profile key. This option takes the highest precedence and replaces any profile setting. Use
           this switch if you want to change a configured profile value without changing the profile itself.

               This option accepts any key which can be configured in a profile (see
               *<a href="../man5/dput.5.html">dput</a>(5)*). Sub keys are addressed using a dot notation. Keys are separated
               using a equals sign ("=").

               For example, to override the 'allow_dcut' you may do:

               --override "allow_dcut=true"

               The '--override' option may be repeated:

               --override "check-debs.enforce=debs" --override "check-debs.skip=false"

               Providing the same key on the command line several times will be additive.

               Un-setting a key entirely can be achieved using the '-S' option. Such
               overrides take no argument. Thus, the command line

               --override "allow_dcut=true" --unset "run_lintian"

               will set 'allow_dcut' to 'TRUE' and revert the 'run_lintian' key to
               whatever the internal default value is set.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--passive</b>
           Force FTP passive mode when uploading the package through FTP. This option is deprecated - please
           declare this in the target profile.

               This option is a shortcut for --override "passive_ftp=true"

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--simulate</b>
           Simulate the upload only. This runs all pre-upload checks, initializes the upload handler but does
           not actually push any files to the remote host.

               This argument can be repeated twice in which case also the network
               connection is set-up (for example logging in through the FTP or SFTP
               protocol) and tested for its functionality.

       <b>-S,--unset</b>=OVERRIDE
           Override the configured profile key by unsetting its value. See <b>-O</b> for a full explanation of the
           behavior.

       <b>-U,</b> <b>--no-upload-log</b>
           Do not write a .upload log file after uploading.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--unchecked</b>
           Do not check GnuPG signature. You may also set this in your profile with the <b>allow_unsigned_uploads</b>
           key.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
           Ignored silently for compatibility with old-style dput command lines.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--check-version</b>
           Ignored silently for compatibility with old-style dput command lines.

       <b>HOST</b>
           Target host to upload a package. This refers to any existing upload site, which either can be a
           section in old-style <b>dput.cf</b> files, or alternatively any profile in a read <b>dput.d</b> directory. If <b>HOST</b>
           was not supplied, the (first) profile having the default_host_main flag set to a non-empty string
           will be selected. If neither, <u>HOST</u> was present, nor any profile setting the upload host, dput-ng
           scans for a profile called <u>ftp-master</u> which will be used on a successful look-up.

       <b>CHANGES-FILE</b>
           A Debian package.changes file. Arguments may be repeated several times to upload more than one
           package at once.

</pre><h4><b>PROFILES</b></h4><pre>
       Profiles may define upload <u>HOST</u> names, log-in details and their required upload methods used to upload
       packages. Moreover, profiles define checks which are running before and after uploading. Their format is
       described in <b><a href="../man5/dput.5.html">dput</a>(5)</b>.

       Additionally, <b>dput</b> reads old-style configuration files from INI style configuration files. This format is
       deprecated for use in dput-ng and described in <b><a href="../man5/dput.cf.5.html">dput.cf</a>(5)</b>. In particular this configuration file format
       does not support all configurable settings which are specific to dput-ng.

       It is possible to run <b>dput</b> with any combination of new-style and old-style configuration files. When both
       types of files are present,

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>0</b>
           Success

       <b>1</b>
           A runtime check returned an error

       <b>2</b>
           An internal error was detected, for example while loading configuration files

       <b>3</b>
           An upload error was detected, for example a permission or authentication problem while uploading
           files
