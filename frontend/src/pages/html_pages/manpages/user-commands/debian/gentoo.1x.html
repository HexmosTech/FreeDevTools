</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gentoo - A highly configurable file manager for X

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       gentoo  [--version]  [--locale-info]  [--root-ok] [--no-rc] [--no-gtkrc] [--no-dir-history] [--left=path]
       [--right=path] [--run=ARG]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       gentoo is a file manager for Linux and compatible systems. It allows you to interactively  navigate  your
       file  system using the mouse, and also to perform various fairly standard operations (such as copy, move,
       rename, ...)  on the files and directories contained therein.

       gentoo always shows you the contents of two directories at once. Each of these is displayed  in  its  own
       scrollable  list, called a pane. At any time, exactly one pane is the <u>current</u> pane, and has a highlighted
       bar running across its top region. The current pane acts as the source for all file operations, while the
       other pane is the destination. You can select rows in panes using selection methods of varying complexity
       (from simply clicking a row, to selecting rows by name using a  regular  expression).  Once  you  have  a
       selection, you can click a button to perform some command on the selected files.

       All file operations performed by gentoo are implemented natively. When you use gentoo to copy a file, for
       example, gentoo does <u>not</u> simply execute the system's <b><a href="../man1L/cp.1L.html">cp</a></b>(1L) command. Rather, gentoo contains its own code
       for  opening  source and destination files, and then reading and writing the right amount of data between
       them. This way of doing things makes gentoo independent of the  availability  of  shell  commands  to  do
       things.

       gentoo  incorporates  a  fairly  powerful,  object-oriented  file typing and styling system. It can use a
       variety of ways to determine the <b>type</b> of the files  it  is  displaying.  Each  type  is  then  linked  to
       something  called  a  <b>style,</b> which controls how rows of that type are rendered in panes. You can use this
       system to control icons, colors, and various operations on the rows. For example,  it  is  easy  to  make
       gentoo display all PNG images in red, and to invoke <b>The</b> <b><a href="../man1/GIMP.1.html">GIMP</a></b>(1) on them when double-clicked.

       A  design  goal  with  gentoo  has  been to provide full GUI configurability, removing the need to edit a
       configuration file by hand and restart the program to see the changes, as is  otherwise  common  in  many
       programs  for  Un*x.  As  a  result  of this, gentoo features a Configuration dialog window where you can
       configure most aspects of its operation directly, using the mouse and standard GUI widgets.

       gentoo borrows its basic look'n'feel from the classic Amiga file manager Directory OPUS,  but  is  not  a
       "clone" of any kind.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       gentoo is not primarily driven by command line arguments, but the following are available:

       <b>--version</b>
              Causes gentoo to print its version number (a string of the form MAJOR.MINOR.MICRO, like 0.20.7) to
              the  standard  output,  and then exit successfully. Numbers having an odd MINOR component indicate
              development versions of the program. So far, all versions of gentoo have been classified as  being
              development versions.

       <b>--locale-info</b>
              Makes gentoo print a couple of localization settings, and then exit.  This is mostly useful during
              development and debugging, and not of a lot of interest when just using the application.

       <b>--root-ok</b>
              Makes  gentoo  accept  being  run  by  the  root  user.  Normally, this is not allowed since it is
              considered a big threat to system security. Note that gentoo has  the  ability  to  execute  user-
              defined  strings  using  the <b><a href="../man3/execvp.3.html">execvp</a></b>(3) function. This is generally considered harmful. However, if
              you <b>really</b> want to run gentoo while logged on as root, supplying this option allows you to. It  is
              <b>not</b> recommended, though.

       <b>--no-rc</b>
              Starts  up  gentoo  without  loading  any configuration file. This makes it run using the built-in
              defaults, which are <b>very</b> Spartan indeed. Seldom comfortable, but occasionally handy when trying to
              determine if a problem is with the configuration or with the core code.

       <b>--no-gtkrc</b>
              Avoids loading the GTK+ RC file, thus disabling any widget customizations, and forces all  widgets
              to use the default GTK+ look.

       <b>--no-dir-history</b>
              Avoids  loading  the  file  that  holds  the  history, i.e. which directories have been previously
              visited by the two panes. Very rarely needed, included mostly for completeness' sake.

       <b>--left,</b> <b>--right</b> <b>(or</b> <b>-1,</b> <b>-2)</b>
              Sets the initial path for the left and right pane, respectively. If present,  the  path  specified
              with  one  of  these options overrides any other path for the pane in question. See below (Initial
              Directory Paths) for details.

       <b>--run</b> <b>ARG</b> <b>(or</b> <b>-rARG)</b>
              Runs ARG, a gentoo command. Commands specified this way are executed  before  gentoo  accepts  any
              user input through the graphical interface, but after the configuration file has been read in. You
              can  use  it  many  times  in  order  to make gentoo run a whole series of commands. Remember that
              gentoo's command names are case-sensitive, and that built-in commands (like "About") always  begin
              with a capital letter.

       Any  non-option  command  arguments  will  be silently ignored. If an argument "-h" or "--help" is given,
       gentoo will give a summary of its supported command line options and exit  successfully.  If  an  unknown
       option is given, or a option is missing a required argument, gentoo will whine and exit with a failure.

</pre><h4><b>BASIC</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       When  gentoo  starts  up,  it  will  open  up  its  single  main  window,  which  is split vertically (or
       horizontally; it's configurable) down the middle, forming the two panes mentioned above. It also contains
       a bank of buttons along the bottom.

   <b>Initial</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Paths</b>
       The actual paths shown in the two panes upon start-up can be controlled in various ways. There  are  four
       ways of getting a path to show up in pane. In order of decreasing priority, they are:

       1. Command-line Argument
              Using  the  --left  and --right (or their short forms, -1 and -2) command-line arguments overrides
              any other setting.

       2. Configured Default Directory
              If no command-line argument is present, and the "Default Directory" configuration option  is  set,
              that directory is used.

       3. Most Recently Visited Directory
              If  no  default  directory exists, the most recently visited directory is taken from the directory
              history for each pane. This only works if a directory history file has been found and loaded.

       4. Current Directory
              If all else fails, gentoo uses the current directory (".").

   <b>Navigating</b>
       Navigating around the file system using gentoo is very simple. The two panes act as independent views  of
       the file system, and both are navigated in exactly the same way.

       You  can  always  see which directory a pane is showing by reading its path, shown in the entry box below
       (by default--you can change the position to above) the pane.

       To enter a directory, locate it in the pane and double click it with the left mouse button.  gentoo  will
       read the directory's contents, and update the display accordingly.

       There  are several ways of going <b>up</b> in the directory structure. To enter the directory containing the one
       currently shown (the current dir's <b>parent</b>), you can: click the parent button (to the  left  of  the  path
       entry  box); hit <b>Backspace</b> on your keyboard; click the middle mouse button; select "Parent" from the pop-
       up menu on the right mouse button, or click the downward arrow to the right of the path box (this pops up
       the directory history menu), then select the second row from the top.

   <b>Selecting</b> <b>Files</b>
       Before you can do anything to a file, you need to select it. All file-management commands in  gentoo  act
       upon the current selection (in the current pane). There are several ways of selecting files, but the most
       frequently  used  are  mouse-based.  Note  that the word "file" used below really should be taken to mean
       "file or directory", since selection doesn't distinguish between the two.

       To select a file (or directory), just point the mouse at the name (anywhere in  the  row  is  fine),  and
       click  the  left mouse button. The colors of the clicked row will change, indicating that it is currently
       selected. To select more rows, keep the mouse button down, and drag the mouse vertically. gentoo  extends
       the  selection,  including  all rows touched.  If you drag across the top or bottom border, the pane will
       scroll, trying to keep up.  This is a very quick and convenient way of selecting multiple files, as  long
       as they are listed in succession.

       If  you  click  again on an already selected file, you will unselect it. You can drag to unselect several
       files, just as when selecting.

       To select a sequence of files without dragging, first click normally on the first file that you  wish  to
       select.  Then  release  the mouse button, locate the last file in the sequence (it can be either above or
       below the first one), hold down <b>shift</b> on your keyboard, and click the wanted file. gentoo  now  adds  all
       files between the first and the last to the current selection.

       If  you  follow  the  instructions  given above to select a sequence, but press <b>control</b> rather than <b>shift</b>
       before clicking the second time, gentoo will <u>unselect</u> the range of files indicated.

       If you click on a file with the <b>meta</b> key held down (that's actually a key labeled  <b>Alt</b>,  located  to  the
       immediate  left  of  the space bar, on my PC keyboard), gentoo will do something cool: it will select (or
       unselect, it's a toggle just like ordinary selection) all files, including the clicked one, that have the
       same <b>type</b> as the one you clicked. This can be used to select  for  example  all  PNG  image  files  in  a
       directory even if you can only see one. Occasionally very useful.

       If  you  click  on a file with both the <b>shift</b> and <b>control</b> keys held down, gentoo will toggle the selected
       state of all files having the same file name <u>extension</u> as the one you  clicked.  This  can  sometimes  be
       useful  to select files that you don't have a proper <b>type</b> defined for, as long as those files do share an
       extension, that is.

   <b>Changing</b> <b>Sort</b> <b>Order</b>
       The files and directories listed in each of  gentoo's  two  panes  are  always  sorted  on  some  column:
       typically  file  name. You can chose to sort on some other field by clicking the appropriate column title
       once. If you click on the field that is already current, the sorting will be reversed (i.e., for names it
       will be Z-A rather than A-Z).

       If your display includes icons, try sorting on that column: gentoo will then order each row according  to
       its  File  Style, grouping the rows based on their parent styles, all the way up to the root of the Style
       tree. This means that, for example, JPEG and PNG pictures (both  having  an  immediate  parent  style  of
       Image)  will  be  shown together, and before all Text files (HTML, man pages and so on). It's quite cool,
       really. :)

   <b>Executing</b> <b>Commands</b>
       Commands are used to make gentoo <b>do</b> stuff. The typical command operates upon the set of selected files in
       the current pane, so it's usually a good idea to first select some files. See the previous subsection for
       details on how to select files. Once you have a bunch of files selected, you need to  tell  gentoo  which
       command to execute. There are several ways of doing this.

       Most  basic  file  operations  (e.g.  copy,  move, rename, and so on) are found on the (cleverly labeled)
       buttons along the bottom of gentoo's main window. To copy a file, just select it, then click  the  button
       labeled  "Copy".  It's  really  that  simple.  Most  of these built-in (or <b>native</b>) commands automatically
       operate recursively on directories, so you could copy (or move)  a  whole  directory  of  files  by  just
       selecting it and then clicking "Copy".

       If  you  can't  see a button that does what you want to do, there's a chance that the command exists, but
       isn't bound. Click the right mouse button in a pane, this opens up the "pane  pop-up  menu".  Select  the
       "Run..."  item. This opens up a dialog window showing all available commands. Select a command, and click
       "OK" to execute it.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       gentoo is a pretty complicated program; it has a rather large amount of configuration data that it  needs
       in  order  to  be really useful. For example, my current personal configuration file contains well over a
       thousand different configuration values.

       To store this hefty amount of configuration data, gentoo uses a heavily structured configuration file. In
       fact, the file is (or at least it should be) legal XML!

       When new features are added to gentoo, they will typically require some form of configuration data.  This
       data  is  then  simply  added  somewhere  in the existing configuration file structure. Effort is made to
       assign reasonable built-in default values for all such new features, so older configuration  files  (that
       don't  contain  the values required by the new features) should still work. The first time you hit "Save"
       in the configuration window after changing your version of gentoo, your personal configuration file  will
       be updated to match the version of gentoo.

       Describing  how  to  go about configuring gentoo is too big a topic for a manual page to cover. I'll just
       say that the command to open up the  configuration  window  is  called  "Configure".  It  is  by  default
       available  on a button (typically the top-right one), in the pane pop-up menu, and also by pressing the <b>C</b>
       key on your keyboard.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.config/gentoo/gentoorc">~/.config/gentoo/gentoorc</a></u>
              A user's personal configuration file. When gentoo starts up, it will try to load this file. If the
              file isn't found, the old name  <u><a href="file:~/.gentoorc">~/.gentoorc</a></u>  is  tested,  and  if  that  also  fails  a  site-wide
              configuration (see below) will be tried instead.

       <u>/etc/gentoorc</u>
              This  is  the site-wide configuration file. If a user doesn't have a configuration in his/her home
              directory, gentoo loads this file instead. The actual location of this file  is  slightly  system-
              dependent,  the above is the default. As an end user, you typically won't need to access this file
              manually.

       <u><a href="file:~/.config/gentoo/dirhistory">~/.config/gentoo/dirhistory</a></u>
              This file contains lists of the most recently visited directories, for both panes. These  are  the
              lists  that appear in the drop-down menu when the arrow next to the path entry box is clicked. Can
              be disabled in the Dir Pane configuration.

       <u><a href="file:~/.config/gentoo/gtkrc">~/.config/gentoo/gtkrc</a></u>
              This file allows you to control the look of the widgets used by gentoo,  through  the  GTK+  style
              system.  You can change the actual path in gentoo's Configuration window, the above is the typical
              default for a modern Linux-based system. If a file named gtkrc is  not  found  in  the  configured
              path, the names <u>gentoogtkrc</u> and <u>.gentoogtkrc</u> (note the period), in that order, are also tested.

       <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>,</u> <u><a href="file:/etc/group">/etc/group</a></u>
              These  two  files normally hold the system's password and group information.  These are (probably)
              the ones gentoo uses to map user IDs to login names, to do tilde-expansion (mapping of  user  name
              to directory path), and to map group IDs to group names.  That is <u>probably,</u> because gentoo doesn't
              actually  refer  to  these  files  by  name.  Instead,  it uses the (BSD-style) API function calls
              <b><a href="../man3/getpwent.3.html">getpwent</a></b>(3) and <b><a href="../man3/getgrent.3.html">getgrent</a></b>(3) to access this information.

       <u><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a>,</u> <u><a href="file:/proc/mounts">/proc/mounts</a>,</u> <u>(or</u> <u><a href="file:/etc/mtab">/etc/mtab</a>)</u>
              These files contain data on available and mounted file systems. They are read  by  gentoo's  auto-
              mounting  code.  You  can  configure  the exact file names used, on the "Mounting" tab in the main
              configuration window.  Note that using <u><a href="file:/proc/mounts">/proc/mounts</a></u> rather than <u><a href="file:/etc/mtab">/etc/mtab</a></u> is recommended on  Linux
              systems; they contain roughly the same data, but the one in <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> is always up to date, and faster
              to read!

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       All  releases  of  gentoo  numbered 0.x.y, where x (the so called <b>minor</b> version number) is odd, are to be
       considered <b>development</b> releases, as opposed to <b>stable</b> ones. This means that the  software  will  probably
       suffer  from  bugs.  If  you  find  something  that you suspect is indeed a bug, please don't hesitate to
       contact the author!  For details on how to do this, see below.

       If you're concerned about using potentially buggy and completely  unwarranted  software  to  manage  your
       precious files, please feel free <b>not</b> to use gentoo. The world is full of alternatives.

       The  chances  that  a  bug  gets  fixed increase greatly if you report it. When reporting a bug, you must
       describe how to reproduce it, and also try to be as detailed and precise as possible in your  description
       of  the  actual  bug.  If  possible,  perhaps  you  should include the output of <b><a href="../man1/gdb.1.html">gdb</a></b>(1) (or whatever your
       system's debugger is called). In some cases it might be helpful if you include the configuration file you
       were using when the problem occurred. Before reporting a bug, please make sure that  you  are  running  a
       reasonably recent version of the software, since otherwise "your" bug might already been fixed. See below
       for how to obtain new releases.

       Also,  you  should locate and read through the <b>BUGS</b> file distributed with gentoo, so you don't go through
       all this hassle just to report an already known bug, thereby wasting everybody's time...

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       gentoo was written, from scratch, by Emil Brink. The first line of code was written on May 15th, 1998. It
       is my first program to use the GTK+ GUI toolkit, my first program to be released under the GPL, and  also
       my first really major Linux application.

       The    only    efficient    way    to    contact    me    (to   report   bugs,   give   praise,   suggest
       features/fixes/extensions/whatever) is by Internet e-mail. My address is &lt;<b><a href="mailto:emil@obsession.se">emil@obsession.se</a></b>&gt;.  <b>Please</b> try
       and include the word "gentoo" in the Subject part of your e-mail, to help me organize my  inbox.  Thanks.
       If you're really not in the mood for the direct feel of e-mail, the second best choice for reporting bugs
       and  making suggestions is the use the web-based bug tracker at &lt;<b>https://sourceforge.net/p/gentoo/bugs/</b>&gt;.
       Thanks for contributing.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The author wishes to thank the following people for their various contributions to gentoo:

       Johan Hanson (&lt;<a href="mailto:johan@tiq.com">johan@tiq.com</a>&gt;)
              Johan is the man behind all icon graphics in gentoo, and also the author  of  the  custom  widgets
              used  in  it. He also comes up with plenty of ideas for new features and changes to old ones, some
              of which are even implemented. Johan has stuff at &lt;<a href="http://www.bahnhof.se/~misagon/">http://www.bahnhof.se/~misagon/</a>&gt;.

       Jonas Minnberg (&lt;<a href="mailto:sasq@nightmode.org">sasq@nightmode.org</a>&gt;)
              Jonas did intensive testing of  early  versions  of  gentoo,  and  eventually  persuaded  me  into
              releasing it (back around version 0.9.7 or so).

       Ulf Petterson (&lt;<a href="mailto:ulf@obsession.se">ulf@obsession.se</a>&gt;)
              Ulf drew the main gentoo logo (the one shown in the About window), and also designed the main HTML

              Maintainer  of  the  gentoo  package  for  Debian  Linux,  and  also  a  source of suggestions for
              improvements, as well as a relay for bug reports from Debian Linux users.

       Ryan Weaver (&lt;<a href="mailto:ryanw@infohwy.com">ryanw@infohwy.com</a>&gt;)
              Maintainer of the gentoo packages for Red Hat Linux, and  probably  one  of  the  fastest  package
              creators out there. :)

       Oliver Braun, Jim Geovedi and Pehr Johansson
              Maintainers of gentoo ports to FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD, respectively.

       Thanks  also  to all people who have mailed me about gentoo, providing bug reports, feature requests, and
       the occasional kind word. :^) It's because of people like yourselves that we have this wonderful computer
       platform to play with.

       access,  you  could  take a look at <b>&lt;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">http://www.gnu.org/</a>&gt;.</b>  It is important to realize that the mentioned
       license means that there is <b>ABSOLUTELY</b> <b>NO</b> <b>WARRANTY</b> for this software.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>INFO</b></h4><pre>
       Some unfinished, outdated, but still pretty informative documentation is available, in  HTML  format,  in
       the  <b>docs/</b>  subdirectory  in  the distribution archive. If you haven't installed gentoo from the original
       .tar.gz distribution archive, you might need to either inspect the distribution you <b>did</b> use  (perhaps  it
       came as some form of "package"), or contact a system administrator.

       The  GTK+  GUI  toolkit  that  gentoo  requires  is  available at <b>&lt;<a href="http://www.gtk.org/">http://www.gtk.org/</a>&gt;.</b>  gentoo uses the
       slightly outdated stable series, called 1.2.x. The latest known release in that series  is  GTK+  1.2.10.
       Because  of  severe  performance  problems, gentoo will probably not be ported to use the current (2.0.x)
       series of GTK+ any time soon.

       The  latest  version  of  gentoo  is  always  available  on   the   official   gentoo   home   page,   at
       <b>&lt;<a href="http://www.obsession.se/gentoo/">http://www.obsession.se/gentoo/</a>&gt;.</b>
