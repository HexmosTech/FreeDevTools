       dupload - Debian package upload tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dupload</b> [<u>options</u>...] [<u>changes-file</u>|<u>directory</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dupload</b> is a tool that enables people maintaining Debian packages to easily upload them to a Debian
       repository.

       <b>dupload</b> checks each non-option argument to find readable files or directories. It parses the files as
       <u>.changes</u> files, or tries to find such files in the given directories.

       <b>dupload</b> will warn if the name of the file does not end with <u>.changes</u>. Further processing is done changing
       into the directories of the changes files.

       <b>dupload</b> tests the available checksums and size for each file listed in the <u>.changes</u> file, and fails if it
       finds a mismatch. If all this goes well, <b>dupload</b> checks if there is an <u>.upload</u> file with the basename of
       the <u>.changes</u> file.  If the file to be uploaded is recorded to have already been uploaded to the specified
       host, it is skipped.

       After the list of files to upload is finished, <b>dupload</b> tries to connect to the server and upload. Each
       successfully uploaded file is recorded in the <u>.upload</u> log file.

       If all files of a package are processed, the <u>.changes</u> file is mailed to the announcement address
       specified in the configuration file, see the Announcement section for more details.

   <b>Upload</b> <b>methods</b>
       The default transfer method is <b>ftp</b>.  Alternative methods are <b>http</b>, <b>https</b>, <b>scp</b>/SSH, <b>scpb</b>/SSH, <b>rsync</b>/SSH
       and <b>copy</b>.

       If you are using an upload queue, use <b>ftp</b> because it is fast.  If you are using an authenticated host,
       <b>always</b> use <b>https</b>, or one of <b>scp</b> or <b>rsync</b> via SSH, because <b>ftp</b> transmits the password in clear text.

       <b>ftp</b>
         If  no  login  (username)  is  defined  in  the configuration file, <b>anonymous</b> is used.  The password is
         derived from your login name and your  hostname,  which  is  common  for  anonymous  FTP  logins.   For
         anonymous logins only, you can provide the "password" in the configuration file.

         For  logins other than <b>anonymous</b>, you are asked for the password.  For security reasons there is no way
         to supply it via the command-line or the environment.

       <b>http</b> (since 2.9.9) / <b>https</b> (since 2.9.9)
         There is no default login nor password.  If you specify a  login,  a  password  will  be  fetched  from
         <b>passwordcmd</b> or if that is not defined via the Secret Service interface, otherwise it will be prompted.

       <b>scp</b> (since 1.8) / <b>scpb</b> (since 1.17)
         The default login is delegated to SSH and its own configuration.

         The  <b>scp</b>/SSH  method only works properly if no password is required (see <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1)).  When you use <b>scp</b>, it
         is recommended to set the "method" keyword to <b>scpb</b>, which will transfer all files in a batch.

       <b>rsync</b> (since 2.4.1)
         The default login is delegated to SSH and its own configuration.

       <b>copy</b> (since 2.9.0)
         The <b>copy</b> method works by simply copying the files to another directory in the local filesystem.

   <b>Announcement</b>
       If the host has been configured to send announcement mails,  the  <u>.changes</u>  file  will  be  sent  to  the
       specified addresses.

       The contents of all the following files are prepended to the announcement mail body, if present:

       <u>package</u><b>.announce</b>
       <u>package_upstream-version</u><b>.announce</b>
       <u>package_upstream-version</u><b>-</b><u>revision</u><b>.announce</b>

       Where <u>upstream-version</u> and <u>revision</u> are to be replaced with actual version numbers.  For example, if your
       package is called <b>foobar</b>, has upstream version 3.14, and Debian revision 2:

       • If you only want the announcement to be made with only ONE upload, you name it <u>foobar_3.14-2.announce</u>.

       • If   you   want  it  to  be  made  with  every  upload  of  a  particular  upstream  version,  name  it
         <u>foobar_3.14.announce</u>.

       • If you want it made with <b>every</b> upload of a given package, name it <u>foobar.announce</u>.

       By default, the announcement addresses are unset because dinstall sends mails instead.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-t</b>, <b>--to</b> <u>nickname</u>
                   Upload to <u>nickname</u>'d host.  <u>nickname</u> is the key for doing lookups in the config file. You can
                   use the <b>default_host</b> configuration option to specify a host without <b>--to</b>.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--configfile</b> <u>filename</u>
                   Read the file <u>filename</u> as a configuration file, in addition to the global configuration file.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b> Upload regardless of the transfers logged as already completed.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keep</b>  Keep going, skipping packages whose checksums does not match.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b> Be quiet, i.e., suppress normal output and progress bars.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b> [<u>level</u>]
                   Enable more verbose output from the <b>ftp</b>, <b>scp</b> and <b>scpb</b> methods.

                   For <b>scp</b> and <b>scpb</b> (since 2.10.2) a <b>-v</b> per <u>level</u> is passed to the <b>scp</b> command.

       <b>--no</b>        Dry run, no files are changed, no upload is attempted, only tell what we would do.

       <b>--nostats</b>   Suppress printing download statistics.

                   Since version 2.10.2.

       <b>--mta</b> <u>pathname</u>
                   Use <u>pathname</u> as the sendmail compatible MTA.  The MTA specified must support the <b>-f</b> option to
                   set the envelope sender address, and the <b>-F</b> option  to  set  the  sender's  full  name.   The
                   default is <u>/usr/sbin/sendmail</u>.

                   Since version 2.9.8.

       <b>--nomail</b>    Suppress  announcement  for this run. You can send it later by just calling dupload again w/o
                   this option. Note that this option is by default implied for all hosts with the <b>dinstall_runs</b>
                   option set to 1.

       <b>--mailonly</b>  Acts as if <b>--no</b> has been specified, but sends the announcements, unconditionally.

       <b>--noarchive</b> Adds an <b>X-No-Archive:</b> <b>yes</b> header so that the announcement will not be archived. You  can  use
                   the per-host <b>archive</b> option in the configuration file.

       <b>--skip-hooks</b> <u>hook</u>[,...]
                   Skip  running  the  comma-separated list of hooks.  The hook names can be the filename or the
                   absolute pathname for the hook command, excluding any argument.  This option can be specified
                   multiple times.

                   Since version 2.11.0.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--print</b> Print the "database" as read from the config files and exit.  If  a  host  is  specified  via
                   option <b>--to</b>, only this host's entry is displayed.

       <b>--help</b>      Prints the program usage message and exits.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--Version</b>
                   Prints version and exits.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/dupload.conf</u>
       <u><a href="file:~/.dupload.conf">~/.dupload.conf</a></u>
       <b>--configfile</b> <u>config-file</u>
           The configuration files are loaded if available in the order listed, overriding previous files.

       <u>package</u><b>.announce</b>
       <u>package_upstream-version</u><b>.announce</b>
       <u>package_upstream-version</u><b>-</b><u>revision</u><b>.announce</b>
           If present, they will all be read to prepend to the announcement mail.

       <u>.changes</u>
       <u>.dsc</u>
       <u>.orig.tar.*</u>
       <u>.debian.tar.*</u>
       <u>.diff.*</u>
       <u>.deb</u>
           The <u>.changes</u> file to upload and all of its referenced files.

       <u>package_version_arch</u>.upload
           The file where <b>dupload</b> writes the upload log.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DUPLOAD_SKIP_HOOKS</b>
         A comma-separated list of hooks to skip running.  The <b>--skip-hooks</b> option overrides this setting.

         Since version 2.11.0.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dupload</b>  is  tested  on  <b>Debian</b>  systems only. It should not require too much effort to make it run under
       others systems, though.
