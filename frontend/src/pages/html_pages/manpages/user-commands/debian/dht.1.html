</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       ./dht subcommand [args..]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the Debian Haskell Team multi purpose tool, combining various more or less useful tools.

       Supported subcommands:

       • cabal-debian - Run cabal-debian with inferred parameters

       • dch - Append the changelog

       • debian2dsc - generate a dsc file from a debian directory

       • init - Create an initial packaging

       • make-all - Rebuilds a set of packages

       • mass-change - Apply a change to many packages

       • tag - Tag a built package

       • upgrade - Upgrade a package to the version in the package plan

       • upload - Uploads, tags and pushes

       • what-to-upload - Lists .changes files that should be uploaded

</pre><h4><b>Subcommands</b></h4><pre>
   <b>dht</b> <b>cabal-debian</b>
       Usage: dht cabal-debian [option...]

       This  is  a  wrapper  around  cabal-debian that tries to infer a few useful facts: * If the test suite is
       enabled.  * Which Cabal flags are to be used.  * The source package name.

       None of these checks are perfect, so check the result.

       It also passes --official.

   <b>dht</b> <b>dch</b>
       Usage: dht dch [debchange option]

       This is a wrapper for <a href="../man1/debchange.1.html">debchange</a>(1), which will implement our custom heuristics of whether a new changelog
       entry should be created, or the current one be amended: If the current version is tagged,  create  a  new
       changelog entry, else append to the current one.

       It  passes  either  –append or –increment to debchange, so you should not.  The –newversion option may be
       used in order to specify the version number.

   <b>dht</b> <b>debian2dsc</b>
       Usage: dht debian2dsc [-o output/] [dir ...]

       Expects directories containing the  contents  of  the  debian/  directory  of  a  Debian  source  package
       (i.e. control,  changelog,  watch, ...).  Uses the watch file to retrieve the upstream tarball (unless it
       already exists in the local  directory),  creates  a  debian.tar.xz  tarball  from  the  given  directory
       (ignoring  the  ususal  suspects  like  _darcs and *~) and creates a corresponding .dsc file; all without
       unpacking the upstream tarball.

   <b>dht</b> <b>init</b>
       Usage: dht init [-D distribution] Cabal-Pkg ...

       This script will:

       • Query the package plan for the desired version number of CabalPkg.

       • Use cabal unpack --pristine to fetch the source into the right directory

       • Run cabal-debian –official to initialize the packaging.

       • Optimistically mark the package as ready for release

       • Commit this to git.

       Please review the package afterwards, in particular debian/copyright.

   <b>dht</b> <b>make-all</b>
       Usage: dht make-all [–excluded-packages PKG,PKG,...]  [-o|–output DIR] [–bindmount  DIR]  [-j|–jobs  INT]
       [-c|–chroot SCHROOT] [–shake-verbosity VERBOSITY] [–keep-going] [–sbuild-option OPTION] [TARGET...]

       Rebuilds a set of packages

       Available  options: -h,–help Show this help text –excluded-packages PKG,PKG,...  comma or space separated
       list  of  source  package   names   to   ignore   (default:   ghc,   ghc-testsuite,   haskell-devscripts,
       haskell98-report,  haskell-platform)  -o,–output  DIR  output  directory  (default: “lab”) –bindmount DIR
       directory bind-mounted in the schroot (default: “<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>”) -j,–jobs INT number of parallel jobs (default: 1)
       -c,–chroot SCHROOT name of the schroot to use (default: “haskell”) –shake-verbosity  VERBOSITY  verbosity
       for shake (Silent, Quiet, Normal, Loud, Chatty or Diagnostic) (default: Info) –keep-going keep going even
       if there are errors –sbuild-option OPTION An option to pass on to sbuilder (can be passed multiple times)

   <b>dht</b> <b>mass-change</b>
       Usage: dht mass-change [-n] [MESSAGE] [ACTION] DIRECTORY ...

       This  script  runs ACTION in each of the given directories.  If the ACTION effected a change, it will add
       MESSAGE to the changelog.

       It assumes that all directories are in the same git repository as  this  script.   It  ensures  that  the
       repository is clean to begin with, and will commit all changes at once at the end, if there was a change.

   <b>dht</b> <b>tag</b>
       Usage: dht tag [–dry-run] [directory..]

       For  all  given  directories, which should be Debian source packages, figure out the current version from
       debian/changeslog and create a tag, tagging the youngest git commit that changed this  particular  source
       package.

       With –dry-run it simply checks if it could tag everything (suite not UNRELEASED, not already tagged), and
       returns 0 if it could.

   <b>dht</b> <b>upgrade</b>
       Usage: dht upgrade [-D dist] directory/

       This script will:

       • Query the package plan for the desired version number.

       • Run debchange to amend the debian/changlog.

       • Run cabal-debian –official –upgrade to upgrade the packaging.

       • Optimistically mark the package as ready for release

       • Commit this to git.

       At  the  end,  it  will  rightfully  ask you to review the changes, giving you a helpful link to the diff
       between the upstream sources.

   <b>dht</b> <b>upload</b>
       Usage: dht upload [-h HOST] [foo.changes]

       Signs the .changes file and the corresponding .dsc file in a temporary location (to  avoid  touching  the
       original files), uploads them to the archive using dput, tags them in the repository and pushes the tag.

       If  the -h parameter is specified, upload to HOST, rather than the dput default_host.  If mass-uploading,
       it is suggested to use ssh-upload for robustness (see the discussion in #833536).

       If no changes file is given, but the script is run in a debian  source  package,  it  checks  the  parent
       directory for an appropriately named changes file, just like <a href="../man1/debrelease.1.html">debrelease</a>(1) would do.

       Checks that the distribution is not UNRELEASED and that the tag does not exist already.

   <b>dht</b> <b>what-to-build</b>
       Usage: dht what-to-build [directory..]

       For all given directories (defaults to p/*/), check if they are to be built.  This means, in particular:

       • The latest entry in debian/changelog is <u>not</u> UNRELEASED, and

       • there is no corresponding tag in the git repository.

   <b>dht</b> <b>what-to-upgrade</b>
       Usage: dht what-to-upgrade [directory..]

       For  all  given  directories  (defaults to p/*/), check if they are to be upgraded, i.e. that the package
       plan lists a newer version than the changelog.

   <b>dht</b> <b>what-to-upload</b>
       Usage: dht what-to-upload foo.changes ..

       Given a number of changes files, reports hose that should be uploaded,  i.e.   the  distribution  is  not
       UNRELEASED and that the tag does not exist already.
