         debian-builder is a simple script which is designed to facilitate the
        rebuilding of a Debian GNU/Linux package from its source code.  It will
        correctly handle the installation of any required build-dependencies,
        and remove them once building is complete.

   <b>buildPackage</b>
          Do all the work of building the given package.

          Return '&gt;0' on success, '0' on failure of any kind.  (The result is the
        number of binary files moved into the results directory.)

   <b>parseCommandLineArguments</b>
         Parse any command line arguments, and set the appropriate values
        in the global CONFIG hash.

   <b>getSourcePackageName</b>
         Return the name of the source package required to build package 'foo'

   <b>getPackageSource</b>
         Download the source of the package to the specified directory
        and return the name of the unpacked directory.

   <b>updateChangeLog</b>
         If the Debian changelog file doesn't already refer to the specified
        version then add it.

   <b>saveDebianPackage</b>
         Move the build Debian package, associated .diff.gz file, .changes file,
        etc.  From the build directory into the binary directory.

         Return the number of files moved into the binary directory.

   <b>tidySystem</b>
         Uninstall all the build dependency packages we installed.

         We do this by finding the list of all packages which are currently
        installed and removing those that were not present when we started.

   <b>getInstalledPackages</b>
         Return a hash of all the currently installed packages.

   <b>installBuildDependencies</b>
         Install the build-dependencies required to build the given package.

   <b>removePackages</b>
         Remove the given array of packages from the system.

   <b>END</b>
         Desperately try to reset the host system to the same starting point
        as it initially had.

         This should be taken care of in situations where the script doesn't
        abort on an error condition.
