</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gophian-make - Prepare a Go module for packaging in Debian

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gophian</b> <b>make</b> &lt;IMPORTPATH&gt; [OPTIONS]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  subcommand  prepares a Debian package for Go software, producing a DEP-14 and Go team compliant Git
       repository that has the latest appropriate upstream source imported, and  initial  packaging  files  that
       have been filled out intelligently as best as possible.

       Before  starting,  Gophian will check if the <b>IMPORTPATH</b> passed has already been packaged for Debian. This
       makes use of the same functionality used by <u><a href="../man1/gophian-show.1.html">gophian-show</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/gophian-search.1.html">gophian-search</a></u>(1), which makes use of the
       <b>XS-Go-Import-Path</b> field specified in Debian source packages. If found, Gophian will warn you, and  unless
       the <b>--no-warn-packaged</b> option was passed, the program will exit.

       If  Gophian  finds binary programs (files that start with "package 'main'") in the upstream code, it will
       prompt you to choose what type of package you intend to create. The prompt can be skipped ahead  of  time
       by setting the <b>--type</b> option.

       •   <b>Library</b>  <b>only</b> - Package is only intended to be imported by other programs. The source package will be
           named after the library. This is most Go packages depended on by other projects.

       •   <b>Library</b> <b>and</b> <b>accompanying</b> <b>binaries</b> - Package is intended to be imported  by  other  programs,  with  a
           helper or side program(s), usually meant to be used alongside the library. The source package will be
           named  after  the library. For example, the main purpose of github.com/go-git/go-git is to be used by
           other code, but also includes a proof-of-concept CLI called go-git.

       •   <b>Binaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>accompanying</b> <b>library</b> - Package is intended to be used by the end user as a program,  but
           also  supplies  a library to programs that want to consume it. The source package will be named after
           the binary. For example, Docker is mainly used as a CLI,  but  is  also  intentionally  developed  by
           upstream in such a way that it is reusable to other projects, and so is also available as a library.

       •   <b>Binary</b>  <b>only</b>  -  Package  is  only  intended  to be used as a program by the end user, and no library
           package should be created. The source package will be named after the binary. This is  most  end-user
           programs written in Go.

       If  no  binary  packages  are  found,  the  "library  only"  package type is chosen automatically without
       prompting you.

       If you selected one of the package types that include one or more binaries, you will then be prompted  to
       select  which  binaries  you'd  like  to include in the generated d/control template. You should use this
       opportunity to check for and exclude any example programs that are not intended to be built.

       If you selected one of the package types "<b>Binaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>accompanying</b> <b>library</b>" or "<b>Binary</b> <b>only</b>",  you  will
       be  prompted  to choose which binary to name the source package after. This should usually be the name of
       the primary program intended to be used by the end user, which is often also the  name  of  the  upstream
       project itself.

       Following  this,  Gophian  will  check  for  any existing Salsa repos under the Go team with this name of
       source package, and warn you if one has been found. The program will then exit unless the <b>--no-warn-salsa</b>
       flag was passed.

       Gophian will also check for any open Intent to Package (ITP) or Request for Package (RFP)  bugs  matching
       the source package name and warn you. If found, this will be filled in the generated d/changelog for you.

       Gophian  will  now  prepare  the  packaging  Git  repository,  importing  the  latest upstream source and
       generating the initial packaging files. It will also check  for  any  unpackaged  dependencies  and  test
       dependencies and warn you about them.

       Once  this is complete, it is strongly recommended you review all the Debian packaging files generated by
       Gophian and ensure all information is correct, and then fill in any missing information and complete  any
       additional packaging work required.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>IMPORTPATH</b> - The import path of the Go package being Debianized.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--type</b> [l|l+b|b+l|b] - Select the type of software being packaged. Can be one of "<b>Library</b> <b>only</b>", "<b>Library</b>
       <b>and</b>  <b>accompanying</b>  <b>binaries</b>",  "<b>Binaries</b>  <b>and</b>  <b>accompanying</b> <b>library</b>", or "<b>Binaries</b> <b>only</b>", denoted by "l",
       "l+b", "b+l", or "b" respectively.

       <b>--name</b> &lt;NAME&gt; - Name of package maintainer. Uses <u>DEBFULLNAME</u> environment variable by default. (required)

       <b>--email</b> &lt;EMAIL&gt; - Email of package maintainer. Uses <u>DEBEMAIL</u> environment variable by default. (required)

       <b>--[no-]quiet</b> - Don't print warnings.

       <b>--[no-]warn-packaged</b> - Warn if the given Go package has already been packaged for Debian. (default: true)

       <b>--[no-]warn-salsa</b> - Warn if the package already has  a  repo  under  the  Go  team  namespace  on  Salsa.
       (default: true)

       <b>--[no-]itp</b> - Generate an ITP template as well. (default: false)

       <b>--[no-]todo</b> - Generate a debian/TODO file. (default: false)

       <b>--[no-]gpg-sign</b>  - GPG sign the commit that merges the upstream tarball into the packaging branch. If not
       passed to Gophian, then it will not be passed to git nor gbp and they will use their configured defaults.

       <b>--[no-]include-upstream-history</b> - Include upstream  git  history.  Upstream  will  be  tracked  with  the
       'upstreamvcs'  remote,  and  commits that import new package versions will include the upstream commit or
       tag as a parent. (default: false)

       <b>--git-remote</b> [ssh|https] - Protocol to use when setting Git remote. (default: ssh)

       <b>--help</b> - Show help message and exit.
