</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       plcfwd - Qualcomm Atheros Forward Configuration

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>plcfwd</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>device</u>] [<u>device</u>] [...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Set  VLAN  and MAC address lookup for tx path traffic.  Setup requests are processed by master PLC device
       attached to the local device.  Upon receiving the request MME, the PLC device will  send  a  confirm  MME
       back with the results to the originating host.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the <b>plc</b> man page for an overview and
       installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -<b>A</b>     Add VLANIDs of multiple slaves to memory.

       -<b>C</b>     Commit configruation to flash memory.

       -<b>D</b> <u>VLANID</u>
              Set the default VLAN ID expressed as a 32-bit decimal value.

       -<b>e</b>     Redirects  stderr  messages  to  stdout.   By  convention status and error messages are printed on
              stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout
              in cases where this is desired.

       -<b>f</b> <u>filename</u>
              Read additional device addresses and VLAN IDs  from  the  named  file.   This  option  may  appear
              multiple  times  and  may appear in addition option -z.  Each occurance of this option adds one or
              more entries to the VLANID table used by options <b>-A</b> or <b>-R</b>.  The format used on each line  of  this
              file is identical to that used by option <b>-z</b>.

       -<b>i</b> <u>interface</u>
              Select  the  host  Ethernet  interface.   All  requests  are sent via this host interface and only
              reponses received via this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is  <b>eth1</b>  because
              most  people  use <b>eth0</b> as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC"
              is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.  This option then takes precedence
              over either default.

       -<b>l</b> <u>length</u>
              The read data length in bytes.  This option is ignored during other  operations.   The  length  is
              expressed in decimal.  The default is <b>0</b> bytes.

       -<b>M</b> <u>state</u>
              Enable or disable VLANID forwarding on the master.  Valid states are <b>0</b> to disable and <b>1</b> but values
              up  to  <b>255</b>  are  permitted.   Keywords  "<b>on</b>"  and "<b>enable</b>" are the same as <b>1</b>.  Keywords "<b>off</b>" and
              "<b>disable</b>" are the same as <b>0</b>.

       -<b>o</b> <u>offset</u>
              The read data offset in bytes.  This option is ignored during other  operations.   The  offset  is
              expressed in hexadecimal.  The default is <b>0</b> bytes;

       -<b>q</b>     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -<b>R</b>     Remove VLANIDs of multiple slaves from memory.

       -<b>S</b> <u>state</u>
              Enable or disable VLANID forwarding on all slaves.  Valid states are <b>0</b> to disable and <b>1</b> but values
              up  to  <b>255</b>  are  permitted.   Keywords  "<b>on</b>"  and "<b>enable</b>" are the same as <b>1</b>.  Keywords "<b>off</b>" and
              "<b>disable</b>" are the same as <b>0</b>.

       -<b>t</b> <u>timeout</u>

       -<b>v</b>     Prints additional information on stdout.  In  particular,  this  option  dumps  outgoing  Ethernet
              packets on stdout.

       -<b>z</b> <u>address</u>,<u>id</u>[,<u>id</u>[,...]]
              A  device  address  and  associated VLAN IDs separated by commas.  This option may appear multiple
              times and may appear in addition option -f.  Each occurance of this option adds one entry  to  the
              VLANID  table  used by options <b>-A</b> or <b>-R</b>.  The string format used here is identical to that used on
              each line of input files named by option <b>-f</b>.

       -<b>?</b>,--<b>help</b>
              Displays program help information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other  options
              on the command line except version information.

       -<b>!</b>,--<b>version</b>
              Displays  program  version  information  on  stderr.   This option takes precedence over all other
              options on the command line except help information.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to
              Atheros technical staff.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>device</u> The MAC address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified.  If  more  than
              one  address  is  specified  then  operations  are  performed on each device in turn.  The default
              address is <b>local</b>.  See <b>DEVICES</b> for information about symbolic device addresses.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address  is  a  48-bit  value
       entered  as  12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be separated with
       colons for clarity.  For example, "00b052000001", "00:b0:52:00:00:01" and "00b052:000001" are  valid  and
       equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       <b>all</b>    Same as "broadcast".

       <b>broadcast</b>
              A  synonym  for  the  Ethernet  broadcast address, <b>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</b>.  All devices, whether local,
              remote or foreign recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device  at  the
              far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       <b>local</b>  A   synonym   for   the   Qualcomm   Atheros  vendor  specific  Local  Management  Address  (LMA),
              <b>00:B0:52:00:00:01</b>.  All local Atheros devices  recognize  this  address  but  remote  and  foreign
              devices  do  not.   A  remote  device  is  any device at the far end of a powerline connection.  A
              foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       See the Qualcomm Atheros HomePlug AV Firmware Technical Reference Manual for technical information.

</pre><h4><b>DISCLAIMER</b></h4><pre>
       Atheros HomePlug AV Vendor Specific Management Message structure and content is proprietary  to  Qualcomm
       Atheros, Ocala FL USA.  Consequently, public information may not be available.  Qualcomm Atheros reserves
       the  right  to modify message structure and content in future firmware releases without any obligation to
       notify or compensate users of this program.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following example reads <b>100</b> bytes starting at offset <b>0x24</b>.  The operation is <b>read</b>  because  no  other
       operation  is  specifed  using  <b>-A</b>,  <b>-C</b>, <b>-R,</b> <b>-M</b> or <b>-S</b>.  The offset is always in hexadecimal and length is
       always in decimal.

          # plcfwd -o 24 -l 100

       The following example adds three VLAN IDs to the VLANID table on  device  <b>00:B0:52:CA:FE:08</b>.   Option  <b>-z</b>
       creates  the VLANID table and option <b>-A</b> adds table content to the device.  This program supports up to 10
       VLAN IDs per entry but PLC firmware supports 8 maximum.

          # plcfwd -A -z 00:B0:52:CA:FE:08,2300,2313,2415

       The following example does the same thing but adds three table entries.  The first entry is  enclosed  in
       quotes  because spaces appear in the entry.  The third entry has more than 10 VLAN IDs.  The program will
       discard the last ID without indication but PLC firmware should report an error  because  there  are  more
       than 8 IDs reported in the request message.

          #    plcfwd    -A    -z   "00:B0:52:CA:FE:08,   2300,   2313   ,   2415"   -z   00B052BABE01,0100   -z
       00B052888888,100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900,1000,1100

       To avoid typing the above command line many times, you can save the entries in file <b>plcfwd.txt</b>,  like  so
       ...

          00:B0:52:CA:FE:08, 2300, 2313 , 2415
          00B052BABE01,0100
          00B052888888,100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900,1000,1100

       The  next  example  adds  these  entries to the VLANID table by naming the file that contains the entries
       using option <b>-f</b>.

          # plcfwd -A -f plcfwd.txt

       The next example removes the same entries to the VLANID table.

          # plcfwd -R -f plcfwd.txt

       Of course, you can combine options <b>-z</b> and <b>-f</b> to cumulative effect.
