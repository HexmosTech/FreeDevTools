</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       amprate - Qualcomm Atheros AR7x00 PHY Rate Monitor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>amprate</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>device</u>] [<u>device</u>] [...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Atheros  PHY  Rate Utility polls one or more devices and prints the average transmit and receive PHY
       rates between a device and each neighboring network device.  Output is column-oriented and  suitable  for
       loading into a spreadsheet or being read by a simple program.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the <b>plc</b> man page for an overview and
       installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>COMMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       This program version is identical to legacy program <b>int6k</b>, except for options <b>-t</b> and <b>-T</b> which use version
       <b>1</b>  of the Qualcomm Atheros <b>VS_NW_INFO</b> vendor-specific message.  Older firmware versions may not recognize
       this message version.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -<b>c</b>     Display coded PHY rates.  Coded PHY rates are displayed by default so this option is redundant but
              it has been kept for backword compatibility.  This option and option <b>-u</b> are mutually exclusive.

       -<b>d</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Traffic duration in seconds per connection.  Directional traffic is  systematically  sent  between
              each  pair  of  powerline  network  devices for this period of time.  Consequently, the total time
              needed to generate traffic between all network devices will be approximately <b>n!</b> times this  value,
              so don''t get carried away.  The minimum value is <b>1</b> second and the maximum value is <b>60</b> seconds.

       -<b>e</b>     Redirects  stderr  messages  to  stdout.   By  convention status and error messages are printed on
              stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout
              in cases where this is desired.

       -<b>i</b> <u>interface</u>
              Select the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are  sent  via  this  host  interface  and  only
              reponses  received  via this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is <b>eth1</b> because
              most people use <b>eth0</b> as their principle network connection; however, if environment  string  "PLC"
              is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.  This option then takes precedence
              over either default.

       -<b>n</b>     Reads  the average transmit and receive PHY rate for wach device using VS_NW_INFO and prints it on
              stdout.  Each output line displays the ethernet interface, source address, destination address and
              either the transmit or receive PHY rate.

       -<b>o</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
              Read timeout in milliseconds.  Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This  is  the  maximum  time
              allowed for a response.  The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

       -<b>r</b>     Reads device hardware and software revision information using VS_SW_VER and prints it on stdout.

       -<b>R</b>     Resets the device using VS_RS_DEV.

       -<b>t</b>     Generate  powerline  traffic  between  the  local  device and each remote device on each powerline
              network connected to the host.  It does not generate any traffic between remote  powerline  device
              pairs.   This  option  is  especially  useful  when  remote powerline devices are not connected to
              Ethernet devices capable of sending traffic back to the host.

       -<b>T</b>     Generate powerline traffic between all devices on each powerline network connected  to  the  host.
              This  option  is  similar  to option <b>-t</b> but it takes much longer because traffic is systematically
              generated between each pair of  powerline  devices.   Consequently,  the  time  to  complete  will
              increase  factorially  as  the  number  of  network devices increases.  Such complete traffic path
              coverage is not always needed.

       -<b>u</b>     Display un-coded PHY rates.  Coded PHY rates are displayed by default.  This option and option  <b>-c</b>
              are mutually exclusive.

       -<b>q</b>     Enter quiet mode.  Progress messages are suppressed.

       -v     Enter verbose mode.  All Etherenet frames sent or received by the program are displayed on stdout.

       -<b>x</b>     Exit program on first error with a non-zero exit code.  This option allows shell scripts to detect
              failed or incomplete operations and take the appropriate action.

       -<b>?</b>,--<b>help</b>
              Print  program  help  summary  on  stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the
              command line.

       -<b>!</b>,--<b>version</b>
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other  options  on
              the  command line.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that
              they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>device</b> The MAC address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified.  If  more  than
              one  address  is  specified  then  operations  are  performed on each device in turn.  The default
              address is <b>local</b>.  See <b>DEVICES</b> for information about symbolic device addresses.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address  is  a  48-bit  value
       entered  as  12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be separated with
       colons for clarity.  For example, "00b052000001", "00:b0:52:00:00:01" and "00b052:000001" are  valid  and
       equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       <b>all</b>    Same as "broadcast".

       <b>broadcast</b>
              A  synonym  for  the  Ethernet  broadcast address, <b>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</b>.  All devices, whether local,
              remote or foreign recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device  at  the
              far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       <b>local</b>  A   synonym   for   the   Qualcomm   Atheros  vendor  specific  Local  Management  Address  (LMA),
              <b>00:B0:52:00:00:01</b>.  All local Atheros devices  recognize  this  address  but  remote  and  foreign
              devices  do  not.   A  remote  device  is  any device at the far end of a powerline connection.  A
              foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       See the Qualcomm Atheros HomePlug AV Firmware Technical Reference Manual for more information.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following example displays the average transmit and receive PHY rates from each of two devices.   One
       is  a  local  device  connected  to interface <b>eth2</b> and the other is a remote device at the far end of the
       powerline.  In this case, they are the only two devices on the powerline network.  Observe the recipricol
       rates shown.

          # amprate -ni eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB TX 163 mbps
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB RX 176 mbps
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:BB 00:B0:52:00:00:AA TX 176 mbps
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:BB 00:B0:52:00:00:AA RX 163 mbps

       The following example generates powerline traffic between the local device and each remote device because
       option <b>-t</b> is present.  It then displays the PHY rate read from the local device.

          # amprate -tni eth2
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB TX 163 mbps
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB RX 176 mbps
