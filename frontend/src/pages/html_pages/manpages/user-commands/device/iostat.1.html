</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>iostat</b> command is used for monitoring system input/output device loading by observing  the  time  the
       devices are active in relation to their average transfer rates. The <b>iostat</b> command generates reports that
       can  be  used  to  change  system  configuration to better balance the input/output load between physical
       disks.

       The first report generated by the <b>iostat</b> command provides statistics concerning the time since the system
       was booted, unless the <b>-y</b> option is used (in this case, this first report is omitted).   Each  subsequent
       report  covers  the  time  since  the  previous  report. All statistics are reported each time the <b>iostat</b>
       command is run. The report consists of a CPU  header  row  followed  by  a  row  of  CPU  statistics.  On
       multiprocessor  systems,  CPU  statistics  are calculated system-wide as averages among all processors. A
       device header row is displayed followed by a line of statistics for each device that is configured.

       The <u>interval</u> parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds between each report. The  <u>count</u>  parameter
       can  be  specified  in  conjunction with the <u>interval</u> parameter. If the <u>count</u> parameter is specified, the
       value of <u>count</u> determines the number of reports generated at <u>interval</u>  seconds  apart.  If  the  <u>interval</u>
       parameter is specified without the <u>count</u> parameter, the <b>iostat</b> command generates reports continuously.

</pre><h4><b>REPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>iostat</b> command generates two types of reports, the CPU Utilization report and the Device Utilization
       report.

       CPU Utilization Report
              The first report generated by the <b>iostat</b> command is the CPU Utilization Report. For multiprocessor
              systems, the CPU values are global averages among all processors.  The report  has  the  following
              format:

              %user  Show  the  percentage  of  CPU  utilization that occurred while executing at the user level
                     (application).

              %nice  Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level with
                     nice priority.

              %system
                     Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at  the  system  level
                     (kernel).

              %iowait
                     Show  the  percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle during which the system had an
                     outstanding disk I/O request.

              %steal Show the percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the virtual CPU or CPUs while  the
                     hypervisor was servicing another virtual processor.

              %idle  Show  the  percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the system did not have an
                     outstanding disk I/O request.

       Device Utilization Report
              The second report generated by the <b>iostat</b> command is the Device Utilization  Report.   The  device
              report  provides  statistics  on  a  per  physical  device  or  partition basis. Block devices and
              partitions for which statistics are to be displayed may be entered on the  command  line.   If  no
              device  nor  partition  is  entered,  then  statistics  are displayed for every device used by the
              system, and providing that the kernel maintains statistics for it.  If the <b>ALL</b> keyword is given on
              the command line, then statistics are displayed for every device defined by the system,  including
              those  that  have  never  been used.  Transfer rates are shown in 1K blocks by default, unless the
              environment variable <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.   The  report
              may show the following fields, depending on the flags used (e.g.  <b>-x</b>, <b>-s</b> and <b>-k</b> or <b>-m</b>):

              Device:
                     This column gives the device (or partition) name as listed in the <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u> directory.

              tps    Indicate  the  number of transfers per second that were issued to the device. A transfer is
                     an I/O request to the device. Multiple logical requests can be combined into a  single  I/O
                     request to the device. A transfer is of indeterminate size.

              Blk_read/s (kB_read/s, MB_read/s)
                     Indicate  the  amount  of  data  read  from  the  device  expressed  in  a number of blocks
                     (kilobytes, megabytes) per second. Blocks are equivalent to sectors and  therefore  have  a
                     size of 512 bytes.

              Blk_wrtn/s (kB_wrtn/s, MB_wrtn/s)
                     Indicate  the  amount  of  data  written  to  the  device  expressed  in a number of blocks
                     (kilobytes, megabytes) per second.

              Blk_dscd/s (kB_dscd/s, MB_dscd/s)
                     Indicate the amount of data discarded for the  device  expressed  in  a  number  of  blocks
                     (kilobytes, megabytes) per second.

              Blk_w+d/s (kB_w+d/s, MB_w+d/s)
                     Indicate the amount of data written to or discarded for the device expressed in a number of
                     blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) per second.

              Blk_read (kB_read, MB_read)
                     The total number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) read.

              Blk_wrtn (kB_wrtn, MB_wrtn)
                     The total number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) written.

              Blk_dscd (kB_dscd, MB_dscd)
                     The total number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) discarded.

              Blk_w+d (kB_w+d, MB_w+d)
                     The total number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) written or discarded.

              r/s    The number (after merges) of read requests completed per second for the device.

              w/s    The number (after merges) of write requests completed per second for the device.

              d/s    The number (after merges) of discard requests completed per second for the device.

              f/s    The  number  (after  merges)  of  flush requests completed per second for the device.  This
                     counts flush requests executed by disks. Flush requests are  not  tracked  for  partitions.
                     Before being merged, flush operations are counted as writes.

              sec/s (kB/s, MB/s)
                     The  number  of  sectors  (kilobytes, megabytes) read from, written to or discarded for the
                     device per second.

              rsec/s (rkB/s, rMB/s)
                     The number of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) read from the device per second.

              wsec/s (wkB/s, wMB/s)
                     The number of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) written to the device per second.

              dsec/s (dkB/s, dMB/s)
                     The number of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) discarded for the device per second.

              rqm/s  The number of I/O requests merged per second that were queued to the device.

              rrqm/s The number of read requests merged per second that were queued to the device.

              wrqm/s The number of write requests merged per second that were queued to the device.

              drqm/s The number of discard requests merged per second that were queued to the device.

              %rrqm  The percentage of read requests merged together before being sent to the device.

              %wrqm  The percentage of write requests merged together before being sent to the device.

              %drqm  The percentage of discard requests merged together before being sent to the device.

              areq-sz
                     The average size (in kilobytes) of the I/O requests that were issued to the device.
                     Note: In previous versions, this field was known as avgrq-sz and was expressed in sectors.

              rareq-sz
                     The average size (in kilobytes) of the read requests that were issued to the device.

              wareq-sz
                     The average size (in kilobytes) of the write requests that were issued to the device.

              dareq-sz
                     The average size (in kilobytes) of the discard requests that were issued to the device.

              await  The average time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests issued to the device to be served. This
                     includes the time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servicing them.

              r_await
                     The average time (in milliseconds) for read requests issued to the  device  to  be  served.
                     This includes the time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servicing them.

              w_await
                     The  average  time  (in milliseconds) for write requests issued to the device to be served.
                     This includes the time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servicing them.

              d_await
                     The average time (in milliseconds) for discard requests issued to the device to be  served.
                     This includes the time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servicing them.

              f_await
                     The  average  time  (in milliseconds) for flush requests issued to the device to be served.
                     The block layer combines flush requests and executes at most one at  a  time.   Thus  flush
                     operations  could  be  twice as long: Wait for current flush request, then execute it, then
                     wait for the next one.

              aqu-sz The average queue length of the requests that were issued to the device.
                     Note: In previous versions, this field was known as avgqu-sz.

              %util  Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O requests were issued to the  device  (bandwidth
                     utilization  for the device). Device saturation occurs when this value is close to 100% for
                     devices serving requests serially.  But for devices serving requests in parallel,  such  as
                     RAID arrays and modern SSDs, this number does not reflect their performance limits.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>     Display the CPU utilization report.

       <b>--compact</b>
              Don't  break  the Device Utilization Report into sub-reports so that all the metrics get displayed
              on a single line.

       <b>-d</b>     Display the device utilization report.

       <b>--dec={</b> <b>0</b> <b>|</b> <b>1</b> <b>|</b> <b>2</b> <b>}</b>
              Specify the number of decimal places to use (0 to 2, default value is 2).

       <b>-f</b> <u>directory</u>
       <b>+f</b> <u>directory</u>
              Specify an alternative directory for <b>iostat</b> to read devices statistics. Option <b>-f</b> tells <b>iostat</b>  to
              use  only  the  files located in the alternative directory, whereas option <b>+f</b> tells it to use both
              the standard kernel files and the files located  in  the  alternative  directory  to  read  device
              statistics.

              <u>directory</u>  is  a  directory containing files with statistics for devices managed in userspace.  It
              may contain:

              - a "diskstats" file whose format is compliant with that located in "<a href="file:/proc">/proc</a>",
              - statistics for individual devices contained in files whose format  is  compliant  with  that  of
              files located in "<a href="file:/sys">/sys</a>".

              In particular, the following files located in <u>directory</u> may be used by <b>iostat</b>:

              <u>directory</u>/block/<u>device</u>/stat
              <u>directory</u>/block/<u>device</u>/<u>partition</u>/stat

              <u>partition</u> files must have an entry in <u>directory</u><a href="file:/dev/block/">/dev/block/</a> directory, e.g.:

              <u>directory</u><a href="file:/dev/block/">/dev/block/</a><u>major</u>:<u>minor</u> --&gt; ../../block/<u>device</u>/<u>partition</u>

       <b>-g</b> <u>group_name</u> <b>{</b> <u>device</u> <b>[...]</b> <b>|</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>}</b>
              Display  statistics  for  a  group  of  devices.   The  <b>iostat</b> command reports statistics for each
              individual device in the list then a  line  of  global  statistics  for  the  group  displayed  as
              <u>group_name</u>  and  made  up of all the devices in the list. The <b>ALL</b> keyword means that all the block
              devices defined by the system shall be included in the group.

       <b>-H</b>     This option must be used with option <b>-g</b> and indicates that only global statistics  for  the  group
              are to be displayed, and not statistics for individual devices in the group.

       <b>-h</b>     This option is equivalent to specifying <b>--human</b> <b>--pretty</b>.

       <b>--human</b>
              Print sizes in human readable format (e.g. 1.0k, 1.2M, etc.)  The units displayed with this option
              supersede any other default units (e.g.  kilobytes, sectors...) associated with the metrics.

       <b>-j</b> <b>{</b> <b>ID</b> <b>|</b> <b>LABEL</b> <b>|</b> <b>PATH</b> <b>|</b> <b>UUID</b> <b>|</b> <b>...</b> <b>}</b> <b>[</b> <u>device</u> <b>[...]</b> <b>|</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>]</b>
              Display persistent device names. Keywords <b>ID</b>, <b>LABEL</b>, etc. specify the type of the persistent name.
              These keywords are not limited, only prerequisite is that directory with required persistent names
              is  present  in <u><a href="file:/dev/disk">/dev/disk</a></u>.  Optionally, multiple devices can be specified in the chosen persistent
              name type.  Because persistent device names are usually long, option <b>--pretty</b>  is  implicitly  set
              with this option.

       <b>-k</b>     Display statistics in kilobytes per second.

       <b>-m</b>     Display statistics in megabytes per second.

       <b>-N</b>     Display the registered device mapper names for any device mapper devices.  Useful for viewing LVM2
              statistics.

       <b>-o</b> <b>JSON</b>
              Display  the  statistics  in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.  JSON output field order is
              undefined, and new fields may be added in the future.

       <b>-p</b> <b>[</b> <b>{</b> <u>device</u><b>[,...]</b> <b>|</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>}</b> <b>]</b>
              Display statistics for block devices and all their partitions that are used by the system.   If  a
              device  name  is  entered  on  the command line, then statistics for it and all its partitions are
              displayed. Last, the <b>ALL</b> keyword indicates that statistics have to be displayed for all the  block
              devices and partitions defined by the system, including those that have never been used. If option
              <b>-j</b>  is  defined  before this option, devices entered on the command line can be specified with the
              chosen persistent name type.

       <b>--pretty</b>
              Make the Device Utilization Report easier to read by a human.  The device name will be printed  on
              the  right  side.  The  report  may  also  be broken into sub-reports if there are many metrics to
              display (use <b>--compact</b> option to prevent this).

       <b>-s</b>     Display a short (narrow) version of the report that should fit in 80 characters wide screens.

       <b>-t</b>     Print the time for each report displayed. The timestamp format may depend  on  the  value  of  the
              <b>S_TIME_FORMAT</b> environment variable (see below).

       <b>-V</b>     Print version number then exit.

       <b>-x</b>     Display extended statistics.

       <b>-y</b>     Omit  first  report  with  statistics  since  system boot, if displaying multiple records at given
              interval.

       <b>-z</b>     Tell <b>iostat</b> to omit output for any devices for which there  was  no  activity  during  the  sample
              period.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>iostat</b> command takes into account the following environment variables:

       <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b>
              When  this  variable is set, transfer rates are shown in 512-byte blocks instead of the default 1K
              blocks.

       <b>S_COLORS</b>
              By default statistics are displayed in color when the output is connected to a terminal.  Use this
              variable to change the settings. Possible values for this variable are <u>never</u>, <u>always</u> or <u>auto</u>  (the
              latter is equivalent to the default settings).
              Please note that the color (being red, yellow, or some other color) used to display a value is not
              indicative of any kind of issue simply because of the color. It only indicates different ranges of
              values.

       <b>S_COLORS_SGR</b>
              Specify  the colors and other attributes used to display statistics on the terminal.  Its value is
              a colon-separated list of  capabilities  that  defaults  to  <b>I=32;22:N=34;1:W=35;1:X=31;1:Z=34;22</b>.
              Supported capabilities are:

              <b>I=</b>     SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) substring for device names.

              <b>N=</b>     SGR substring for non-zero statistics values.

              <b>W=</b> (or <b>M=</b>)
                     SGR  substring  for  percentage values in the range from 75% to 90% (or in the range 10% to
                     25% depending on the metric's meaning).

              <b>X=</b> (or <b>H=</b>)
                     SGR substring for percentage values greater than or equal to 90% (or lower than or equal to
                     10% depending on the metric's meaning).

              <b>Z=</b>     SGR substring for zero values.

       <b>S_TIME_FORMAT</b>
              If this variable exists and its value is <b>ISO</b> then the current locale will be ignored when printing
              the date in the report header. The <b>iostat</b> command  will  use  the  ISO  8601  format  (YYYY-MM-DD)
              instead.  The timestamp displayed with option <b>-t</b> will also be compliant with ISO 8601 format.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>iostat</b> Display a single history since boot report for all CPU and Devices.

       <b>iostat</b> <b>-d</b> <b>2</b>
              Display a continuous device report at two second intervals.

       <b>iostat</b> <b>-d</b> <b>2</b> <b>6</b>
              Display six reports at two second intervals for all devices.

       <b>iostat</b> <b>-x</b> <b>sda</b> <b>sdb</b> <b>2</b> <b>6</b>
              Display six reports of extended statistics at two second intervals for devices sda and sdb.

       <b>iostat</b> <b>-p</b> <b>sda</b> <b>2</b> <b>6</b>
              Display six reports at two second intervals for device sda and all its partitions (sda1, etc.)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u> filesystem must be mounted for <b>iostat</b> to work.

       Kernels older than 2.6.x are no longer supported.

       Although  <b>iostat</b> speaks of kilobytes (kB), megabytes (MB)..., it actually uses kibibytes (kiB), mebibytes
       (MiB)...  A kibibyte is equal to 1024 bytes, and a mebibyte is equal to 1024 kibibytes.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/proc/stat">/proc/stat</a></u> contains system statistics.
       <u><a href="file:/proc/uptime">/proc/uptime</a></u> contains system uptime.
       <u><a href="file:/proc/diskstats">/proc/diskstats</a></u> contains disks statistics.
       <u><a href="file:/sys">/sys</a></u> contains statistics for block devices.
       <u><a href="file:/proc/self/mountstats">/proc/self/mountstats</a></u> contains statistics for network filesystems.
       <u><a href="file:/dev/disk">/dev/disk</a></u> contains persistent device names.
