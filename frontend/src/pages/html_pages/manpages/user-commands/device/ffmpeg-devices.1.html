</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ffmpeg-devices - FFmpeg devices

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes the input and output devices provided by the libavdevice library.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The libavdevice library provides the same interface as libavformat. Namely, an input device is considered
       like a demuxer, and an output device like a muxer, and the interface and generic device options are the
       same provided by libavformat (see the ffmpeg-formats manual).

       In addition each input or output device may support so-called private options, which are specific for
       that component.

       Options may be set by specifying -<u>option</u> <u>value</u> in the FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in
       the device "AVFormatContext" options or using the <u>libavutil/opt.h</u> API for programmatic use.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       Input devices are configured elements in FFmpeg which enable accessing the data coming from a multimedia
       device attached to your system.

       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported input devices are enabled by default. You can
       list all available ones using the configure option "--list-indevs".

       You can disable all the input devices using the configure option "--disable-indevs", and selectively
       enable an input device using the option "--enable-indev=<u>INDEV</u>", or you can disable a particular input
       device using the option "--disable-indev=<u>INDEV</u>".

       The option "-devices" of the ff* tools will display the list of supported input devices.

       A description of the currently available input devices follows.

   <b>alsa</b>
       ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) input device.

       To enable this input device during configuration you need libasound installed on your system.

       This device allows capturing from an ALSA device. The name of the device to capture has to be an ALSA
       card identifier.

       An ALSA identifier has the syntax:

               hw:&lt;CARD&gt;[,&lt;DEV&gt;[,&lt;SUBDEV&gt;]]

       where the <u>DEV</u> and <u>SUBDEV</u> components are optional.

       The three arguments (in order: <u>CARD</u>,<u>DEV</u>,<u>SUBDEV</u>) specify card number or identifier, device number and
       subdevice number (-1 means any).

       To see the list of cards currently recognized by your system check the files <u>/proc/asound/cards</u> and
       <u>/proc/asound/devices</u>.

       For example to capture with <b>ffmpeg</b> from an ALSA device with card id 0, you may run the command:

               ffmpeg -f alsa -i hw:0 alsaout.wav

       For more information see: &lt;<b><a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/pcm.html">http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/pcm.html</a></b>&gt;

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>sample_rate</b>
           Set the sample rate in Hz. Default is 48000.

       <b>channels</b>
           Set the number of channels. Default is 2.

   <b>android_camera</b>
       Android camera input device.

       This input devices uses the Android Camera2 NDK API which is available on devices with API level 24+. The
       availability of android_camera is autodetected during configuration.

       This device allows capturing from all cameras on an Android device, which are integrated into the Camera2
       NDK API.

       The  available cameras are enumerated internally and can be selected with the <u>camera_index</u> parameter. The
       input file string is discarded.

       Generally the back facing camera has index 0 while the front facing camera has index 1.

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>video_size</b>
           Set the video size given as a string such as 640x480 or hd720.  Falls back  to  the  first  available
           configuration reported by Android if requested video size is not available or by default.

       <b>framerate</b>
           Set  the  video  framerate.   Falls  back to the first available configuration reported by Android if
           requested framerate is not available or by default (-1).

       <b>camera_index</b>
           Set the index of the camera to use. Default is 0.

       <b>input_queue_size</b>
           Set the maximum number of frames to buffer. Default is 5.

   <b>avfoundation</b>
       AVFoundation input device.

       AVFoundation is the currently recommended framework by Apple for streamgrabbing on OSX &gt;= 10.7 as well as
       on iOS.

       The input filename has to be given in the following syntax:

               -i "[[VIDEO]:[AUDIO]]"

       The first entry selects the video input while the latter selects the audio input.  The stream has  to  be
       specified  by  the device name or the device index as shown by the device list.  Alternatively, the video
       and/or audio input device can be chosen by index using the

           B&lt;-video_device_index E&lt;lt&gt;INDEXE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

       and/or

           B&lt;-audio_device_index E&lt;lt&gt;INDEXE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

       , overriding any device name or index given in the input filename.

       All available devices can be enumerated by  using  <b>-list_devices</b>  <b>true</b>,  listing  all  device  names  and
       corresponding indices.

       There are two device name aliases:

       "default"
           Select the AVFoundation default device of the corresponding type.

       "none"
           Do not record the corresponding media type.  This is equivalent to specifying an empty device name or
           index.

       <u>Options</u>

       AVFoundation supports the following options:

       <b>-list_devices</b> <b>&lt;TRUE|FALSE&gt;</b>
           If set to true, a list of all available input devices is given showing all device names and indices.

       <b>-video_device_index</b> <b>&lt;INDEX&gt;</b>
           Specify the video device by its index. Overrides anything given in the input filename.

       <b>-audio_device_index</b> <b>&lt;INDEX&gt;</b>
           Specify the audio device by its index. Overrides anything given in the input filename.

       <b>-pixel_format</b> <b>&lt;FORMAT&gt;</b>
           Request the video device to use a specific pixel format.  If the specified format is not supported, a
           list  of  available  formats is given and the first one in this list is used instead. Available pixel
           formats are: "monob, rgb555be, rgb555le, rgb565be, rgb565le, rgb24, bgr24, 0rgb, bgr0, 0bgr, rgb0,
            bgr48be, uyvy422, yuva444p, yuva444p16le, yuv444p, yuv422p16, yuv422p10, yuv444p10,
            yuv420p, nv12, yuyv422, gray"

       <b>-framerate</b>
           Set the grabbing frame rate. Default is "ntsc", corresponding to a frame rate of "30000/1001".

       <b>-video_size</b>
           Set the video frame size.

       <b>-capture_cursor</b>
           Capture the mouse pointer. Default is 0.

       <b>-capture_mouse_clicks</b>
           Capture the screen mouse clicks. Default is 0.

       <b>-capture_raw_data</b>
           Capture the raw device data. Default is 0.  Using this option may result in receiving the  underlying
           data  delivered  to  the AVFoundation framework. E.g. for muxed devices that sends raw DV data to the
           framework (like tape-based camcorders), setting this option  to  false  results  in  extracted  video
           frames captured in the designated pixel format only. Setting this option to true results in receiving
           the raw DV stream untouched.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Print the list of AVFoundation supported devices and exit:

                   $ ffmpeg -f avfoundation -list_devices true -i ""

       •   Record video from video device 0 and audio from audio device 0 into out.avi:

                   $ ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i "0:0" out.avi

       •   Record video from video device 2 and audio from audio device 1 into out.avi:

                   $ ffmpeg -f avfoundation -video_device_index 2 -i ":1" out.avi

       •   Record  video  from the system default video device using the pixel format bgr0 and do not record any
           audio into out.avi:

                   $ ffmpeg -f avfoundation -pixel_format bgr0 -i "default:none" out.avi

       •   Record raw DV data from a suitable input device and write the output into out.dv:

                   $ ffmpeg -f avfoundation -capture_raw_data true -i "zr100:none" out.dv

   <b>bktr</b>
       BSD video input device. Deprecated and will be removed  -  please  contact  the  developers  if  you  are
       interested in maintaining it.

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>framerate</b>
           Set the frame rate.

       <b>video_size</b>
           Set the video frame size. Default is "vga".

       <b>standard</b>
           Available values are:

           <b>pal</b>
           <b>ntsc</b>
           <b>secam</b>
           <b>paln</b>
           <b>palm</b>
           <b>ntscj</b>

   <b>decklink</b>
       The decklink input device provides capture capabilities for Blackmagic DeckLink devices.

       To  enable  this  input  device,  you need the Blackmagic DeckLink SDK and you need to configure with the
       appropriate "--extra-cflags" and "--extra-ldflags".  On Windows, you need to run the  IDL  files  through
       <b>widl</b>.

       DeckLink  is  very  picky  about  the  formats  it  supports.  Pixel  format of the input can be set with
       <b>raw_format</b>.  Framerate and video size must be determined for your  device  with  <b>-list_formats</b>  <b>1</b>.  Audio
       sample  rate  is always 48 kHz and the number of channels can be 2, 8 or 16. Note that all audio channels
       are bundled in one single audio track.

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>list_devices</b>
           If set to <b>true</b>, print a list of devices and exit.  Defaults to  <b>false</b>.  This  option  is  deprecated,
           please use the "-sources" option of ffmpeg to list the available input devices.

       <b>list_formats</b>
           If set to <b>true</b>, print a list of supported formats and exit.  Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       <b>format_code</b> <b>&lt;FourCC&gt;</b>
           This  sets  the  input video format to the format given by the FourCC. To see the supported values of
           your device(s) use <b>list_formats</b>.  Note that there is a FourCC <b>'pal</b> <b>'</b> that can also be used as <b>pal</b>  (3
           letters).  Default behavior is autodetection of the input video format, if the hardware supports it.

       <b>raw_format</b>
           Set the pixel format of the captured video.  Available values are:

           <b>auto</b>
               This  is  the  default  which  means 8-bit YUV 422 or 8-bit ARGB if format autodetection is used,
               8-bit YUV 422 otherwise.

           <b>uyvy422</b>
               8-bit YUV 422.

           <b>yuv422p10</b>
               10-bit YUV 422.

           <b>argb</b>
               8-bit RGB.

           <b>bgra</b>
               8-bit RGB.

           <b>rgb10</b>
               10-bit RGB.

       <b>teletext_lines</b>
           If set to nonzero, an additional teletext stream will be captured from the vertical  ancillary  data.
           Both SD PAL (576i) and HD (1080i or 1080p) sources are supported. In case of HD sources, OP47 packets
           are decoded.

           This  option is a bitmask of the SD PAL VBI lines captured, specifically lines 6 to 22, and lines 318
           to 335. Line 6 is the LSB in the mask. Selected lines which do not contain teletext information  will
           be  ignored.  You  can use the special <b>all</b> constant to select all possible lines, or <b>standard</b> to skip
           lines 6, 318 and 319, which are not compatible with all receivers.

           For SD sources, ffmpeg needs to be  compiled  with  "--enable-libzvbi".  For  HD  sources,  on  older
           (pre-4K) DeckLink card models you have to capture in 10 bit mode.

       <b>channels</b>
           Defines number of audio channels to capture. Must be <b>2</b>, <b>8</b> or <b>16</b>.  Defaults to <b>2</b>.

       <b>duplex_mode</b>
           Sets  the  decklink  device  duplex/profile  mode.  Must  be  <b>unset</b>, <b>half</b>, <b>full</b>, <b>one_sub_device_full</b>,
           <b>one_sub_device_half</b>, <b>two_sub_device_full</b>, <b>four_sub_device_half</b> Defaults to <b>unset</b>.

           Note: DeckLink SDK 11.0 have replaced the duplex property by a profile property.   For  the  DeckLink
           Duo  2  and  DeckLink  Quad  2,  a  profile is shared between any 2 sub-devices that utilize the same
           connectors. For the DeckLink 8K Pro, a profile is shared between all 4 sub-devices.  So  DeckLink  8K
           Pro support four profiles.

           Valid   profile   modes  for  DeckLink  8K  Pro(with  DeckLink  SDK  &gt;=  11.0):  <b>one_sub_device_full</b>,
           <b>one_sub_device_half</b>, <b>two_sub_device_full</b>, <b>four_sub_device_half</b>

           Valid profile modes for DeckLink Quad 2 and DeckLink Duo 2: <b>half</b>, <b>full</b>

       <b>timecode_format</b>
           Timecode type to include in the frame and video stream metadata. Must be <b>none</b>, <b>rp188vitc</b>, <b>rp188vitc2</b>,
           <b>rp188ltc</b>, <b>rp188hfr</b>, <b>rp188any</b>, <b>vitc</b>, <b>vitc2</b>, or <b>serial</b>.  Defaults to <b>none</b> (not included).

           In order to properly support 50/60 fps timecodes, the ordering of  the  queried  timecode  types  for
           <b>rp188any</b>  is  HFR,  VITC1, VITC2 and LTC for &gt;30 fps content. Note that this is slightly different to
           the ordering used by the DeckLink API, which is HFR, VITC1, LTC, VITC2.

       <b>video_input</b>
           Sets the video input source. Must be <b>unset</b>, <b>sdi</b>, <b>hdmi</b>, <b>optical_sdi</b>, <b>component</b>, <b>composite</b> or  <b>s_video</b>.
           Defaults to <b>unset</b>.

       <b>audio_input</b>
           Sets  the  audio  input  source.  Must be <b>unset</b>, <b>embedded</b>, <b>aes_ebu</b>, <b>analog</b>, <b>analog_xlr</b>, <b>analog_rca</b> or
           <b>microphone</b>. Defaults to <b>unset</b>.

       <b>video_pts</b>
           Sets the video packet timestamp source. Must be <b>video</b>, <b>audio</b>, <b>reference</b>, <b>wallclock</b> or  <b>abs_wallclock</b>.
           Defaults to <b>video</b>.

       <b>audio_pts</b>
           Sets  the audio packet timestamp source. Must be <b>video</b>, <b>audio</b>, <b>reference</b>, <b>wallclock</b> or <b>abs_wallclock</b>.
           Defaults to <b>audio</b>.

       <b>draw_bars</b>
           If set to <b>true</b>, color bars are drawn in the event of a signal loss.  Defaults to <b>true</b>.   This  option
           is deprecated, please use the "signal_loss_action" option.

       <b>signal_loss_action</b>
           Sets the action to take in the event of a signal loss. Accepts one of the following values:

           <b>1,</b> <b>none</b>
               Do nothing on signal loss. This usually results in black frames.

           <b>2,</b> <b>bars</b>
               Draw color bars on signal loss. Only supported for 8-bit input signals.

           <b>3,</b> <b>repeat</b>
               Repeat the last video frame on signal loss.

           Defaults to <b>bars</b>.

       <b>queue_size</b>
           Sets maximum input buffer size in bytes. If the buffering reaches this value, incoming frames will be
           dropped.  Defaults to <b>1073741824</b>.

       <b>audio_depth</b>
           Sets the audio sample bit depth. Must be <b>16</b> or <b>32</b>.  Defaults to <b>16</b>.

       <b>decklink_copyts</b>
           If  set  to <b>true</b>, timestamps are forwarded as they are without removing the initial offset.  Defaults
           to <b>false</b>.

       <b>timestamp_align</b>
           Capture start time alignment in seconds. If set to nonzero, input frames are dropped till the  system
           timestamp  aligns  with  configured  value.   Alignment  difference  of  up  to one frame duration is
           tolerated.  This is useful for maintaining input synchronization across N different hardware  devices
           deployed for 'N-way' redundancy. The system time of different hardware devices should be synchronized
           with protocols such as NTP or PTP, before using this option.  Note that this method is not foolproof.
           In some border cases input synchronization may not happen due to thread scheduling jitters in the OS.
           Either sync could go wrong by 1 frame or in a rarer case <b>timestamp_align</b> seconds.  Defaults to <b>0</b>.

       <b>wait_for_tc</b> <b>(</b><u>bool</u><b>)</b>
           Drop frames till a frame with timecode is received. Sometimes serial timecode isn't received with the
           first  input frame. If that happens, the stored stream timecode will be inaccurate. If this option is
           set to <b>true</b>, input frames are dropped till a frame with timecode is received.  Option <u>timecode_format</u>
           must be specified.  Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       <b>enable_klv(</b><u>bool</u><b>)</b>
           If set to <b>true</b>, extracts KLV data from VANC and outputs KLV packets.  KLV  VANC  packets  are  joined
           based on MID and PSC fields and aggregated into one KLV packet.  Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   List input devices:

                   ffmpeg -sources decklink

       •   List supported formats:

                   ffmpeg -f decklink -list_formats 1 -i 'Intensity Pro'

       •   Capture video clip at 1080i50:

                   ffmpeg -format_code Hi50 -f decklink -i 'Intensity Pro' -c:a copy -c:v copy output.avi

       •   Capture video clip at 1080i50 10 bit:

                   ffmpeg -raw_format yuv422p10 -format_code Hi50 -f decklink -i 'UltraStudio Mini Recorder' -c:a copy -c:v copy output.avi

       •   Capture video clip at 1080i50 with 16 audio channels:

                   ffmpeg -channels 16 -format_code Hi50 -f decklink -i 'UltraStudio Mini Recorder' -c:a copy -c:v copy output.avi

   <b>dshow</b>
       Windows DirectShow input device.

       DirectShow  support is enabled when FFmpeg is built with the mingw-w64 project.  Currently only audio and
       video devices are supported.

       Multiple devices may be opened as separate inputs, but they may also be opened on the same  input,  which
       should improve synchronism between them.

       The input name should be in the format:

               &lt;TYPE&gt;=&lt;NAME&gt;[:&lt;TYPE&gt;=&lt;NAME&gt;]

       where <u>TYPE</u> can be either <u>audio</u> or <u>video</u>, and <u>NAME</u> is the device's name or alternative name..

       <u>Options</u>

       If  no  options  are  specified,  the  device's  defaults  are  used.  If the device does not support the
       requested options, it will fail to open.

       <b>video_size</b>
           Set the video size in the captured video.

       <b>framerate</b>

           set to rawvideo.

       <b>audio_buffer_size</b>
           Set audio device buffer size in milliseconds (which can directly impact  latency,  depending  on  the
           device).   Defaults  to  using  the  audio  device's  default buffer size (typically some multiple of
           500ms).     Setting    this    value    too    low    can    degrade    performance.     See     also

       <b>video_pin_name</b>
           Select video capture pin to use by name or alternative name.

       <b>audio_pin_name</b>
           Select audio capture pin to use by name or alternative name.

       <b>crossbar_video_input_pin_number</b>
           Select video input pin number for crossbar device. This will be routed to the crossbar device's Video
           Decoder output pin.  Note that changing this value can affect future invocations (sets a new default)
           until system reboot occurs.

       <b>crossbar_audio_input_pin_number</b>
           Select audio input pin number for crossbar device. This will be routed to the crossbar device's Audio
           Decoder output pin.  Note that changing this value can affect future invocations (sets a new default)
           until system reboot occurs.

       <b>show_video_device_dialog</b>
           If  set  to  <b>true</b>,  before  capture  starts, popup a display dialog to the end user, allowing them to
           change video filter  properties  and  configurations  manually.   Note  that  for  crossbar  devices,
           adjusting  values  in  this  dialog  may  be  needed at times to toggle between PAL (25 fps) and NTSC
           (29.97) input frame rates, sizes, interlacing, etc.  Changing these values can enable different  scan
           rates/frame  rates and avoiding green bars at the bottom, flickering scan lines, etc.  Note that with
           some devices, changing these properties can also affect future invocations (sets new defaults)  until
           system reboot occurs.

       <b>show_audio_device_dialog</b>
           If  set  to  <b>true</b>,  before  capture  starts, popup a display dialog to the end user, allowing them to
           change audio filter properties and configurations manually.

       <b>show_video_crossbar_connection_dialog</b>
           If set to <b>true</b>, before capture starts, popup a display dialog to  the  end  user,  allowing  them  to
           manually modify crossbar pin routings, when it opens a video device.

       <b>show_audio_crossbar_connection_dialog</b>
           If  set  to  <b>true</b>,  before  capture  starts, popup a display dialog to the end user, allowing them to
           manually modify crossbar pin routings, when it opens an audio device.

       <b>show_analog_tv_tuner_dialog</b>
           If set to <b>true</b>, before capture starts, popup a display dialog to  the  end  user,  allowing  them  to
           manually modify TV channels and frequencies.

       <b>show_analog_tv_tuner_audio_dialog</b>
           If  set  to  <b>true</b>,  before  capture  starts, popup a display dialog to the end user, allowing them to
           manually modify TV audio (like mono vs. stereo, Language A,B or C).

       <b>audio_device_load</b>
           Load an audio capture filter device from file instead of searching it by name. It may load additional
           parameters too, if the filter supports the serialization of its properties to.  To use this an  audio
           capture source has to be specified, but it can be anything even fake one.

       <b>audio_device_save</b>
           Save the currently used audio capture filter device and its parameters (if the filter supports it) to
           a file.  If a file with the same name exists it will be overwritten.

       <b>video_device_load</b>
           Load  a video capture filter device from file instead of searching it by name. It may load additional
           parameters too, if the filter supports the serialization of its properties to.  To use this  a  video
           capture source has to be specified, but it can be anything even fake one.

       <b>video_device_save</b>
           Save the currently used video capture filter device and its parameters (if the filter supports it) to
           a file.  If a file with the same name exists it will be overwritten.

       <b>use_video_device_timestamps</b>
           If  set  to  <b>false</b>,  the timestamp for video frames will be derived from the wallclock instead of the
           timestamp provided by the capture device. This allows working around devices that provide  unreliable
           timestamps.

       <u>Examples</u>

   <b>fbdev</b>
       Linux framebuffer input device.

       The Linux framebuffer is a graphic hardware-independent abstraction layer to show graphics on a  computer
       monitor, typically on the console. It is accessed through a file device node, usually <u>/dev/fb0</u>.

       For more detailed information read the file Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt included in the Linux source
       tree.

       See also &lt;<b><a href="http://linux-fbdev.sourceforge.net/">http://linux-fbdev.sourceforge.net/</a></b>&gt;, and <b><a href="../man1/fbset.1.html">fbset</a></b>(1).

       To record from the framebuffer device <u>/dev/fb0</u> with <b>ffmpeg</b>:

               ffmpeg -f fbdev -framerate 10 -i /dev/fb0 out.avi

       You can take a single screenshot image with the command:

               ffmpeg -f fbdev -framerate 1 -i /dev/fb0 -frames:v 1 screenshot.jpeg

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>framerate</b>
           Set the frame rate. Default is 25.

   <b>gdigrab</b>
       Win32 GDI-based screen capture device.

       This device allows you to capture a region of the display on Windows.

       Amongst options for the imput filenames are such elements as:

               desktop

       or

               title=&lt;window_title&gt;

       or

               hwnd=&lt;window_hwnd&gt;

       The  first option will capture the entire desktop, or a fixed region of the desktop. The second and third
       options will instead capture the contents of a single window, regardless of its position on the screen.

       For example, to grab the entire desktop using <b>ffmpeg</b>:

               ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -i desktop out.mpg

       Grab a 640x480 region at position "10,20":

               ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -offset_x 10 -offset_y 20 -video_size vga -i desktop out.mpg

       Grab the contents of the window named "Calculator"

               ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -i title=Calculator out.mpg

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>draw_mouse</b>
           Specify whether to draw the mouse pointer. Use the value 0 to not draw the pointer. Default value  is
           1.

       <b>framerate</b>
           Set the grabbing frame rate. Default value is "ntsc", corresponding to a frame rate of "30000/1001".

       <b>show_region</b>
           Show grabbed region on screen.

           If  <u>show_region</u>  is specified with 1, then the grabbing region will be indicated on screen. With this
           option, it is easy to know what is being grabbed if only a portion of the screen is grabbed.

           Note that <u>show_region</u> is incompatible with grabbing the contents of a single window.

           For example:

                   ffmpeg -f gdigrab -show_region 1 -framerate 6 -video_size cif -offset_x 10 -offset_y 20 -i desktop out.mpg

       <b>video_size</b>
           Set the video frame size. The default is to capture the full screen if <u>desktop</u> is  selected,  or  the
           full window size if <u>title=window_title</u> is selected.

       <b>offset_x</b>
           When  capturing  a  region  with  <u>video_size</u>,  set  the  distance from the left edge of the screen or
           desktop.

           Note that the offset calculation is from the top left corner of the primary monitor  on  Windows.  If
           you  have  a  monitor positioned to the left of your primary monitor, you will need to use a negative
           <u>offset_x</u> value to move the region to that monitor.

       <b>offset_y</b>
           When capturing a region with <u>video_size</u>, set the distance from the top edge of the screen or desktop.

           Note that the offset calculation is from the top left corner of the primary monitor  on  Windows.  If
           you  have  a  monitor positioned above your primary monitor, you will need to use a negative <u>offset_y</u>
           value to move the region to that monitor.

   <b>iec61883</b>
       FireWire DV/HDV input device using libiec61883.

       To enable this input device, you need libiec61883, libraw1394 and libavc1394 installed  on  your  system.
       Use the configure option "--enable-libiec61883" to compile with the device enabled.

       The  iec61883  capture  device  supports capturing from a video device connected via IEEE1394 (FireWire),
       using libiec61883 and the new Linux FireWire stack (juju). This is the default  DV/HDV  input  method  in
       Linux Kernel 2.6.37 and later, since the old FireWire stack was removed.

       Specify the FireWire port to be used as input file, or "auto" to choose the first port connected.

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>dvtype</b>
           Override  autodetection  of  DV/HDV.  This should only be used if auto detection does not work, or if
           usage of a different device type should be prohibited. Treating a DV device as HDV  (or  vice  versa)
           will not work and result in undefined behavior.  The values <b>auto</b>, <b>dv</b> and <b>hdv</b> are supported.

       <b>dvbuffer</b>
           Set  maximum size of buffer for incoming data, in frames. For DV, this is an exact value. For HDV, it
           is not frame exact, since HDV does not have a fixed frame size.

       <b>dvguid</b>
           Select the capture device by specifying its GUID. Capturing will only be performed from the specified
           device and fails if no device with the given GUID is found. This is useful to  select  the  input  if
           multiple  devices  are connected at the same time.  Look at /sys/bus/firewire/devices to find out the
           GUIDs.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Grab and show the input of a FireWire DV/HDV device.

                   ffplay -f iec61883 -i auto

       •   Grab and record the input of a FireWire DV/HDV device, using a packet buffer of 100000 packets if the
           source is HDV.

                   ffmpeg -f iec61883 -i auto -dvbuffer 100000 out.mpg

   <b>jack</b>
       JACK input device.

       To enable this input device during configuration you need libjack installed on your system.

       A JACK input device creates one or more JACK writable clients, one for  each  audio  channel,  with  name
       <u>client_name</u>:input_<u>N</u>,  where  <u>client_name</u> is the name provided by the application, and <u>N</u> is a number which
       identifies the channel.  Each writable client will send the acquired data to the FFmpeg input device.

       Once you have created one or more JACK readable clients, you need to connect them to  one  or  more  JACK
       writable clients.

       To connect or disconnect JACK clients you can use the <b>jack_connect</b> and <b>jack_disconnect</b> programs, or do it
       through a graphical interface, for example with <b>qjackctl</b>.

       To list the JACK clients and their properties you can invoke the command <b>jack_lsp</b>.

       Follows an example which shows how to capture a JACK readable client with <b>ffmpeg</b>.

               # Create a JACK writable client with name "ffmpeg".
               $ ffmpeg -f jack -i ffmpeg -y out.wav

               # Start the sample jack_metro readable client.
               $ jack_metro -b 120 -d 0.2 -f 4000

               # List the current JACK clients.
               $ jack_lsp -c
               system:capture_1
               system:capture_2
               system:playback_1
               system:playback_2
               ffmpeg:input_1
               metro:120_bpm

               # Connect metro to the ffmpeg writable client.
               $ jack_connect metro:120_bpm ffmpeg:input_1

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>channels</b>
           Set the number of channels. Default is 2.

   <b>kmsgrab</b>
       KMS video input device.

       Captures  the  KMS scanout framebuffer associated with a specified CRTC or plane as a DRM object that can
       be passed to other hardware functions.

       Requires either DRM master or CAP_SYS_ADMIN to run.

       If you don't understand what all of that means, you probably don't want this.  Look at <b>x11grab</b> instead.

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>device</b>
           DRM device to capture on.  Defaults to <b>/dev/dri/card0</b>.

       <b>format</b>
           Pixel format of the framebuffer.  This can be autodetected if you are running Linux 5.7 or later, but
           needs to be provided for earlier versions.  Defaults to <b>bgr0</b>, which is the most common format used by
           the Linux console and Xorg X server.

       <b>format_modifier</b>
           Format modifier to signal on output frames.  This is necessary to import correctly  into  some  APIs.
           It can be autodetected if you are running Linux 5.7 or later, but will need to be provided explicitly
           when needed in earlier versions.  See the libdrm documentation for possible values.

       <b>crtc_id</b>
           KMS CRTC ID to define the capture source.  The first active plane on the given CRTC will be used.

       <b>plane_id</b>
           KMS  plane  ID  to  define  the  capture source.  Defaults to the first active plane found if neither
           <b>crtc_id</b> nor <b>plane_id</b> are specified.

       <b>framerate</b>
           Framerate to capture at.  This is not synchronised to any page flipping or framebuffer changes  -  it
           just  defines the interval at which the framebuffer is sampled.  Sampling faster than the framebuffer
           update rate will generate independent frames with the same content.  Defaults to 30.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Capture from the first active plane, download the result to normal frames and encode.  This will only
           work if the framebuffer is both linear and mappable - if not, the result may be scrambled or fail  to
           download.

                   ffmpeg -f kmsgrab -i - -vf 'hwdownload,format=bgr0' output.mp4

       •   Capture from CRTC ID 42 at 60fps, map the result to VAAPI, convert to NV12 and encode as H.264.

                   ffmpeg -crtc_id 42 -framerate 60 -f kmsgrab -i - -vf 'hwmap=derive_device=vaapi,scale_vaapi=w=1920:h=1080:format=nv12' -c:v h264_vaapi output.mp4

       •   To  capture  only  part  of  a plane the output can be cropped - this can be used to capture a single
           window, as long as it has a known absolute position and size.  For example, to capture and encode the
           middle quarter of a 1920x1080 plane:

                   ffmpeg -f kmsgrab -i - -vf 'hwmap=derive_device=vaapi,crop=960:540:480:270,scale_vaapi=960:540:nv12' -c:v h264_vaapi output.mp4

   <b>lavfi</b>
       Libavfilter input virtual device.

       This input device reads data from the open output pads of a libavfilter filtergraph.

       For each filtergraph open output, the input device will create a corresponding stream which is mapped  to
       the generated output.  The filtergraph is specified through the option <b>graph</b>.

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>graph</b>
           Specify  the  filtergraph to use as input. Each video open output must be labelled by a unique string
           of the form "out<u>N</u>", where <u>N</u> is a number starting from 0 corresponding  to  the  mapped  input  stream
           generated  by the device.  The first unlabelled output is automatically assigned to the "out0" label,
           but all the others need to be specified explicitly.

           The suffix "+subcc" can be appended to the output label to create an extra  stream  with  the  closed
           captions  packets  attached  to  that output (experimental; only for EIA-608 / CEA-708 for now).  The
           subcc streams are created after all the normal streams, in the order  of  the  corresponding  stream.
           For  example,  if there is "out19+subcc", "out7+subcc" and up to "out42", the stream #43 is subcc for
           stream #7 and stream #44 is subcc for stream #19.

           If not specified defaults to the filename specified for the input device.

       <b>graph_file</b>
           Set the filename of the filtergraph to be  read  and  sent  to  the  other  filters.  Syntax  of  the
           filtergraph is the same as the one specified by the option <u>graph</u>.

       <b>dumpgraph</b>
           Dump graph to stderr.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Create a color video stream and play it back with <b>ffplay</b>:

                   ffplay -f lavfi -graph "color=c=pink [out0]" dummy

       •   As  the  previous example, but use filename for specifying the graph description, and omit the "out0"
           label:

                   ffplay -f lavfi color=c=pink

       •   Create three different video test filtered sources and play them:

                   ffplay -f lavfi -graph "testsrc [out0]; testsrc,hflip [out1]; testsrc,negate [out2]" test3

       •   Read an audio stream from a file using the amovie source and play it back with <b>ffplay</b>:

                   ffplay -f lavfi "amovie=test.wav"

       •   Read an audio stream and a video stream and play it back with <b>ffplay</b>:

                   ffplay -f lavfi "movie=test.avi[out0];amovie=test.wav[out1]"

       •   Dump decoded frames to images and Closed Captions to an RCWT backup:

                   ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "movie=test.ts[out0+subcc]" -map v frame%08d.png -map s -c copy -f rcwt subcc.bin

   <b>libcdio</b>
       Audio-CD input device based on libcdio.

       To enable this input device during configuration you need libcdio installed on your system.  It  requires
       the configure option "--enable-libcdio".

       This device allows playing and grabbing from an Audio-CD.

       For example to copy with <b>ffmpeg</b> the entire Audio-CD in <u>/dev/sr0</u>, you may run the command:

               ffmpeg -f libcdio -i /dev/sr0 cd.wav

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>speed</b>
           Set drive reading speed. Default value is 0.

           The   speed   is   specified   CD-ROM   speed   units.   The   speed   is  set  through  the  libcdio
           "cdio_cddap_speed_set" function. On many CD-ROM drives, specifying a value too large will  result  in
           using the fastest speed.

       <b>paranoia_mode</b>
           Set paranoia recovery mode flags. It accepts one of the following values:

           <b>disable</b>
           <b>verify</b>
           <b>overlap</b>
           <b>neverskip</b>
           <b>full</b>

           Default value is <b>disable</b>.

           For more information about the available recovery modes, consult the paranoia project documentation.

   <b>libdc1394</b>
       IIDC1394 input device, based on libdc1394 and libraw1394.

       Requires the configure option "--enable-libdc1394".

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>framerate</b>
           Set the frame rate. Default is "ntsc", corresponding to a frame rate of "30000/1001".

       <b>pixel_format</b>
           Select the pixel format. Default is "uyvy422".

       <b>video_size</b>
           Set the video size given as a string such as "640x480" or "hd720".  Default is "qvga".

   <b>openal</b>
       The OpenAL input device provides audio capture on all systems with a working OpenAL 1.1 implementation.

       To enable this input device during configuration, you need OpenAL headers and libraries installed on your
       system, and need to configure FFmpeg with "--enable-openal".

       OpenAL  headers  and  libraries  should  be  provided  as  part  of  your OpenAL implementation, or as an
       additional download (an SDK). Depending on your installation you may need to specify additional flags via
       the "--extra-cflags" and "--extra-ldflags" for allowing the build system to locate the OpenAL headers and
       libraries.

       An incomplete list of OpenAL implementations follows:

       <b>Creative</b>
           The official Windows implementation, providing  hardware  acceleration  with  supported  devices  and
           software fallback.  See &lt;<b><a href="http://openal.org/">http://openal.org/</a></b>&gt;.

       <b>OpenAL</b> <b>Soft</b>
           Portable,  open  source  (LGPL)  software implementation. Includes backends for the most common sound
           APIs    on    the    Windows,    Linux,    Solaris,    and    BSD     operating     systems.      See
           &lt;<b><a href="http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html">http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html</a></b>&gt;.

       <b>Apple</b>
           OpenAL    is    part   of   Core   Audio,   the   official   Mac   OS   X   Audio   interface.    See
           &lt;<b><a href="http://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/audio-and-video.html">http://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/audio-and-video.html</a></b>&gt;

       This device allows one to capture from an audio input device handled through OpenAL.

       You need to specify the name of the device to capture in the provided filename. If the  empty  string  is
       provided,  the device will automatically select the default device. You can get the list of the supported
       devices by using the option <u>list_devices</u>.

       <u>Options</u>

   <b>sndio</b>
       sndio input device.

       To enable this input device during configuration you need libsndio installed on your system.

       The filename to provide to the input device is the device node representing the sndio input  device,  and
       is usually set to <u>/dev/audio0</u>.

       For example to grab from <u>/dev/audio0</u> using <b>ffmpeg</b> use the command:

               ffmpeg -f sndio -i /dev/audio0 /tmp/oss.wav

       <u>Options</u>

   <b>video4linux2,</b> <b>v4l2</b>
       Video4Linux2 input video device.

       "v4l2" can be used as alias for "video4linux2".

       If  FFmpeg  is  built  with  v4l-utils  support (by using the "--enable-libv4l2" configure option), it is
       possible to use it with the "-use_libv4l2" input device option.

       The name of the device to grab is a file device node, usually Linux systems tend to automatically  create
       such  nodes  when  the device (e.g. an USB webcam) is plugged into the system, and has a name of the kind
       <u>/dev/videoN</u>, where <u>N</u> is a number associated to the device.

       Video4Linux2 devices usually support a limited set of <u>width</u>x<u>height</u> sizes and frame rates. You  can  check
       which  are  supported  using  <b>-list_formats</b>  <b>all</b>  for Video4Linux2 devices.  Some devices, like TV cards,
       support one or more standards. It is possible to list all the supported standards  using  <b>-list_standards</b>
       <b>all</b>.

       The time base for the timestamps is 1 microsecond. Depending on the kernel version and configuration, the
       timestamps  may  be  derived  from  the real time clock (origin at the Unix Epoch) or the monotonic clock
       (origin usually at boot time, unaffected by NTP or manual changes to the clock). The <b>-timestamps</b>  <b>abs</b>  or
       <b>-ts</b> <b>abs</b> option can be used to force conversion into the real time clock.

       Some usage examples of the video4linux2 device with <b>ffmpeg</b> and <b>ffplay</b>:

       •   List supported formats for a video4linux2 device:

                   ffplay -f video4linux2 -list_formats all /dev/video0

       •   Grab and show the input of a video4linux2 device:

                   ffplay -f video4linux2 -framerate 30 -video_size hd720 /dev/video0

       •   Grab and record the input of a video4linux2 device, leave the frame rate and size as previously set:

                   ffmpeg -f video4linux2 -input_format mjpeg -i /dev/video0 out.mpeg

   <b>vfwcap</b>
       VfW (Video for Windows) capture input device.

       The filename passed as input is the capture driver number, ranging from 0 to 9. You  may  use  "list"  as
       filename to print a list of drivers. Any other filename will be interpreted as device number 0.

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>video_size</b>
           Set the video frame size.

       <b>framerate</b>
           Set the grabbing frame rate. Default value is "ntsc", corresponding to a frame rate of "30000/1001".

   <b>x11grab</b>
       X11 video input device.

       To  enable  this  input  device during configuration you need libxcb installed on your system. It will be
       automatically detected during configuration.

       This device allows one to capture a region of an X11 display.

       The filename passed as input has the syntax:

               [&lt;hostname&gt;]:&lt;display_number&gt;.&lt;screen_number&gt;[+&lt;x_offset&gt;,&lt;y_offset&gt;]

       <u>hostname</u>:<u>display_number</u>.<u>screen_number</u> specifies the X11 display name of the screen to grab from. <u>hostname</u>
       can be omitted, and defaults to "localhost".  The  environment  variable  <b>DISPLAY</b>  contains  the  default
       display name.

       <u>x_offset</u>  and <u>y_offset</u> specify the offsets of the grabbed area with respect to the top-left border of the
       X11 screen. They default to 0.

       Check the X11 documentation (e.g. <b>man</b> <b>X</b>) for more detailed information.

       Use the <b>xdpyinfo</b> program for getting basic information about the properties of  your  X11  display  (e.g.
       grep for "name" or "dimensions").

       For example to grab from <u>:0.0</u> using <b>ffmpeg</b>:

               ffmpeg -f x11grab -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg

       Grab at position "10,20":

               ffmpeg -f x11grab -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0+10,20 out.mpg

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>select_region</b>
           Specify  whether to select the grabbing area graphically using the pointer.  A value of 1 prompts the
           user to select the grabbing area graphically by  clicking  and  dragging.  A  single  click  with  no
           dragging  will select the whole screen. A region with zero width or height will also select the whole
           screen. This option overwrites the <u>video_size</u>, <u>grab_x</u>, and <u>grab_y</u> options. Default value is 0.

       <b>draw_mouse</b>
           Specify whether to draw the mouse pointer. A value of 0 specifies not to draw  the  pointer.  Default
           value is 1.

       <b>follow_mouse</b>
           Make the grabbed area follow the mouse. The argument can be "centered" or a number of pixels <u>PIXELS</u>.

           When  it  is  specified  with "centered", the grabbing region follows the mouse pointer and keeps the
           pointer at the center of region; otherwise, the region follows only when the  mouse  pointer  reaches
           within <u>PIXELS</u> (greater than zero) to the edge of region.

           For example:

                   ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse centered -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg

           To follow only when the mouse pointer reaches within 100 pixels to edge:

                   ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse 100 -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg

       <b>framerate</b>
           Set the grabbing frame rate. Default value is "ntsc", corresponding to a frame rate of "30000/1001".

       <b>show_region</b>
           Show grabbed region on screen.

           If  <u>show_region</u>  is specified with 1, then the grabbing region will be indicated on screen. With this
           option, it is easy to know what is being grabbed if only a portion of the screen is grabbed.

       <b>region_border</b>
           Set the region border thickness if <b>-show_region</b> <b>1</b> is used.  Range is 1 to 128 and default is 3  (XCB-
           based x11grab only).

           For example:

                   ffmpeg -f x11grab -show_region 1 -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0+10,20 out.mpg

           With <u>follow_mouse</u>:

                   ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse centered -show_region 1 -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg

       <b>window_id</b>
           Grab  this  window,  instead  of the whole screen. Default value is 0, which maps to the whole screen
           (root window).

           The id of a window can be found using the <b>xwininfo</b> program, possibly with options -tree and -root.

           If the window is later enlarged, the new area is not recorded. Video ends when the window is  closed,
           unmapped  (i.e.,  iconified)  or  shrunk  beyond the video size (which defaults to the initial window
           size).

           This option disables options <b>follow_mouse</b> and <b>select_region</b>.

       <b>video_size</b>
           Set the video frame size. Default is the full desktop or window.

       <b>grab_x</b>
       <b>grab_y</b>
           Set the grabbing region coordinates. They are expressed as offset from the top left corner of the X11
           window and correspond to the <u>x_offset</u> and <u>y_offset</u> parameters in the device name. The  default  value
           for both options is 0.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       Output  devices  are  configured  elements  in  FFmpeg that can write multimedia data to an output device
       attached to your system.

       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported output devices are enabled by  default.  You  can
       list all available ones using the configure option "--list-outdevs".

       You  can  disable  all the output devices using the configure option "--disable-outdevs", and selectively
       enable an output device using the option "--enable-outdev=<u>OUTDEV</u>", or you can disable a particular  input
       device using the option "--disable-outdev=<u>OUTDEV</u>".

       The option "-devices" of the ff* tools will display the list of enabled output devices.

       A description of the currently available output devices follows.

   <b>alsa</b>
       ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) output device.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Play a file on default ALSA device:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -f alsa default

       •   Play a file on soundcard 1, audio device 7:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -f alsa hw:1,7

   <b>AudioToolbox</b>
       AudioToolbox output device.

       Allows native output to CoreAudio devices on OSX.

       The  output  filename can be empty (or "-") to refer to the default system output device or a number that
       refers to the device index as shown using: "-list_devices true".

       Alternatively, the audio input device can be chosen by index using the

           B&lt;-audio_device_index E&lt;lt&gt;INDEXE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

       , overriding any device name or index given in the input filename.

       All available devices can be enumerated by using <b>-list_devices</b> <b>true</b>, listing all device names,  UIDs  and
       corresponding indices.

       <u>Options</u>

       AudioToolbox supports the following options:

       <b>-audio_device_index</b> <b>&lt;INDEX&gt;</b>
           Specify the audio device by its index. Overrides anything given in the output filename.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Print the list of supported devices and output a sine wave to the default device:

                   $ ffmpeg -f lavfi -i sine=r=44100 -f audiotoolbox -list_devices true -

       •   Output a sine wave to the device with the index 2, overriding any output filename:

                   $ ffmpeg -f lavfi -i sine=r=44100 -f audiotoolbox -audio_device_index 2 -

   <b>caca</b>
       CACA output device.

       This output device allows one to show a video stream in CACA window.  Only one CACA window is allowed per
       application, so you can have only one instance of this output device in an application.

       To enable this output device you need to configure FFmpeg with "--enable-libcaca".  libcaca is a graphics
       library that outputs text instead of pixels.

       For more information about libcaca, check: &lt;<b><a href="http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/libcaca">http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/libcaca</a></b>&gt;

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>window_title</b>
           Set the CACA window title, if not specified default to the filename specified for the output device.

       <b>window_size</b>
           Set  the CACA window size, can be a string of the form <u>width</u>x<u>height</u> or a video size abbreviation.  If
           not specified it defaults to the size of the input video.

       <b>driver</b>
           Set display driver.

       <b>algorithm</b>
           Set dithering algorithm. Dithering is necessary because the picture being rendered  has  usually  far
           more  colours  than  the  available  palette.   The  accepted  values  are  listed with "-list_dither
           algorithms".

       <b>antialias</b>
           Set antialias method. Antialiasing  smoothens  the  rendered  image  and  avoids  the  commonly  seen
           staircase effect.  The accepted values are listed with "-list_dither antialiases".

       <b>charset</b>
           Set  which  characters are going to be used when rendering text.  The accepted values are listed with
           "-list_dither charsets".

       <b>color</b>
           Set color to be used when rendering text.  The accepted values are listed with "-list_dither colors".

       <b>list_drivers</b>
           If set to <b>true</b>, print a list of available drivers and exit.

       <b>list_dither</b>
           List available dither options related to the argument.  The argument must  be  one  of  "algorithms",
           "antialiases", "charsets", "colors".

       •   Show the list of available dither colors and exit:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -pix_fmt rgb24 -f caca -list_dither colors -

   <b>decklink</b>
       The decklink output device provides playback capabilities for Blackmagic DeckLink devices.

       To  enable  this  output  device, you need the Blackmagic DeckLink SDK and you need to configure with the
       appropriate "--extra-cflags" and "--extra-ldflags".  On Windows, you need to run the  IDL  files  through
       <b>widl</b>.

       DeckLink  is  very  picky about the formats it supports. Pixel format is always uyvy422, framerate, field
       order and video size must be determined for your device with <b>-list_formats</b> <b>1</b>. Audio sample rate is always
       48 kHz.

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>list_devices</b>
           If set to <b>true</b>, print a list of devices and exit.  Defaults to  <b>false</b>.  This  option  is  deprecated,
           please use the "-sinks" option of ffmpeg to list the available output devices.

       <b>list_formats</b>
           If set to <b>true</b>, print a list of supported formats and exit.  Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       <b>preroll</b>
           Amount of time to preroll video in seconds.  Defaults to <b>0.5</b>.

       <b>duplex_mode</b>
           Sets  the  decklink  device  duplex/profile  mode.  Must  be  <b>unset</b>, <b>half</b>, <b>full</b>, <b>one_sub_device_full</b>,
           <b>one_sub_device_half</b>, <b>two_sub_device_full</b>, <b>four_sub_device_half</b> Defaults to <b>unset</b>.

           Note: DeckLink SDK 11.0 have replaced the duplex property by a profile property.   For  the  DeckLink
           Duo  2  and  DeckLink  Quad  2,  a  profile is shared between any 2 sub-devices that utilize the same
           connectors. For the DeckLink 8K Pro, a profile is shared between all 4 sub-devices.  So  DeckLink  8K
           Pro support four profiles.

           Valid   profile   modes  for  DeckLink  8K  Pro(with  DeckLink  SDK  &gt;=  11.0):  <b>one_sub_device_full</b>,
           <b>one_sub_device_half</b>, <b>two_sub_device_full</b>, <b>four_sub_device_half</b>

           Valid profile modes for DeckLink Quad 2 and DeckLink Duo 2: <b>half</b>, <b>full</b>

       <b>timing_offset</b>
           Sets the genlock timing pixel offset on the used output.  Defaults to <b>unset</b>.

       <b>link</b>
           Sets the SDI video link configuration on the used output. Must be <b>unset</b>, <b>single</b> link SDI,  <b>dual</b>  link
           SDI or <b>quad</b> link SDI.  Defaults to <b>unset</b>.

       <b>sqd</b> Enable  Square  Division  Quad  Split  mode  for Quad-link SDI output.  Must be <b>unset</b>, <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.
           Defaults to <b>unset</b>.

       <b>level_a</b>
           Enable SMPTE Level A mode on the used output.  Must be <b>unset</b>, <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.  Defaults to <b>unset</b>.

       <b>vanc_queue_size</b>
           Sets maximum output buffer size in bytes for VANC data. If the buffering reaches this value, outgoing
           VANC data will be dropped.  Defaults to <b>1048576</b>.

   <b>fbdev</b>
       Linux framebuffer output device.

       The Linux framebuffer is a graphic hardware-independent abstraction layer to show graphics on a  computer
       monitor, typically on the console. It is accessed through a file device node, usually <u>/dev/fb0</u>.

       For more detailed information read the file <u>Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt</u> included in the Linux source
       tree.

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>xoffset</b>
       <b>yoffset</b>
           Set x/y coordinate of top left corner. Default is 0.

       <u>Examples</u>

       Play  a  file  on  framebuffer  device  <u>/dev/fb0</u>.   Required  pixel format depends on current framebuffer
       settings.

               ffmpeg -re -i INPUT -c:v rawvideo -pix_fmt bgra -f fbdev /dev/fb0

       See also &lt;<b><a href="http://linux-fbdev.sourceforge.net/">http://linux-fbdev.sourceforge.net/</a></b>&gt;, and <b><a href="../man1/fbset.1.html">fbset</a></b>(1).

   <b>opengl</b>
       OpenGL output device. Deprecated and will be removed.

       To enable this output device you need to configure FFmpeg with "--enable-opengl".

       This output device allows one to render to OpenGL context.  Context may be  provided  by  application  or
       default SDL window is created.

       When  device  renders  to  external  context, application must implement handlers for following messages:
       "AV_DEV_TO_APP_CREATE_WINDOW_BUFFER"    -    create     OpenGL     context     on     current     thread.
       "AV_DEV_TO_APP_PREPARE_WINDOW_BUFFER"         -         make        OpenGL        context        current.
       "AV_DEV_TO_APP_DISPLAY_WINDOW_BUFFER" - swap buffers.   "AV_DEV_TO_APP_DESTROY_WINDOW_BUFFER"  -  destroy
       OpenGL  context.   Application  is  also  required to inform a device about current resolution by sending
       "AV_APP_TO_DEV_WINDOW_SIZE" message.

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>background</b>
           Set background color. Black is a default.

       <b>no_window</b>
           Disables default SDL window when set to non-zero value.  Application must provide OpenGL context  and
           both "window_size_cb" and "window_swap_buffers_cb" callbacks when set.

       <b>window_title</b>
           Set  the  SDL window title, if not specified default to the filename specified for the output device.
           Ignored when <b>no_window</b> is set.

       <b>window_size</b>
           Set preferred window size, can be a string of the form widthxheight or a video size abbreviation.  If
           not specified it defaults to the size of the input video, downscaled according to the  aspect  ratio.
           Mostly usable when <b>no_window</b> is not set.

       <u>Examples</u>

       Play a file on SDL window using OpenGL rendering:

               ffmpeg  -i INPUT -f opengl "window title"

   <b>oss</b>
       OSS (Open Sound System) output device.

   <b>pulse</b>
       PulseAudio output device.

       To enable this output device you need to configure FFmpeg with "--enable-libpulse".

       More information about PulseAudio can be found on &lt;<b><a href="http://www.pulseaudio.org">http://www.pulseaudio.org</a></b>&gt;

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>server</b>
           Connect to a specific PulseAudio server, specified by an IP address.  Default server is used when not
           provided.

       <b>name</b>
           Specify  the  application  name PulseAudio will use when showing active clients, by default it is the
           "LIBAVFORMAT_IDENT" string.

       <b>stream_name</b>
           Specify the stream name PulseAudio will use when showing active streams, by default it is set to  the
           specified output name.

       <b>device</b>
           Specify  the  device to use. Default device is used when not provided.  List of output devices can be
           obtained with command <b>pactl</b> <b>list</b> <b>sinks</b>.

       <b>buffer_size</b>
       <b>buffer_duration</b>
           Control the size and duration of the PulseAudio buffer.  A  small  buffer  gives  more  control,  but
           requires more frequent updates.

           <b>buffer_size</b> specifies size in bytes while <b>buffer_duration</b> specifies duration in milliseconds.

           When  both  options  are  provided  then the highest value is used (duration is recalculated to bytes
           using stream parameters). If they are set to 0 (which is default), the device will  use  the  default
           PulseAudio duration value. By default PulseAudio set buffer duration to around 2 seconds.

       <b>prebuf</b>
           Specify  pre-buffering  size in bytes. The server does not start with playback before at least <b>prebuf</b>
           bytes are available in the buffer. By default this  option  is  initialized  to  the  same  value  as
           <b>buffer_size</b> or <b>buffer_duration</b> (whichever is bigger).

       <b>minreq</b>
           Specify  minimum  request  size in bytes. The server does not request less than <b>minreq</b> bytes from the
           client, instead waits until the buffer  is  free  enough  to  request  more  bytes  at  once.  It  is
           recommended  to not set this option, which will initialize this to a value that is deemed sensible by
           the server.

       <u>Examples</u>

       Play a file on default device on default server:

               ffmpeg  -i INPUT -f pulse "stream name"

   <b>sdl</b>
       SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) output device. Deprecated and will be removed.

       For monitoring purposes in FFmpeg, pipes and a video player such as ffplay can be used:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f nut -c:v rawvideo - | ffplay -

       "sdl2" can be used as alias for "sdl".

       This output device allows one to show a video stream in an SDL window. Only one SDL window is allowed per
       application, so you can have only one instance of this output device in an application.

       To enable this output device you need libsdl installed on your system when configuring your build.

       For more information about SDL, check: &lt;<b><a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">http://www.libsdl.org/</a></b>&gt;

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>window_borderless</b>
           Set SDL window border off.  Default value is 0 (enable window border).

       <b>window_enable_quit</b>
           Enable quit action (using window button or keyboard key) when non-zero value  is  provided.   Default
           value is 1 (enable quit action).

       <b>window_fullscreen</b>
           Set fullscreen mode when non-zero value is provided.  Default value is zero.

       <b>window_size</b>
           Set  the  SDL window size, can be a string of the form <u>width</u>x<u>height</u> or a video size abbreviation.  If
           not specified it defaults to the size of the input video, downscaled according to the aspect ratio.

       <b>window_title</b>
           Set the SDL window title, if not specified default to the filename specified for the output device.

       <b>window_x</b>
       <b>window_y</b>
           Set the position of the window on the screen.

       <u>Interactive</u> <u>commands</u>

       The window created by the device can be controlled through the following interactive commands.

       <b>q,</b> <b>ESC</b>
           Quit the device immediately.

       <u>Examples</u>

       The following command shows the <b>ffmpeg</b> output is an SDL window, forcing its size to the qcif format:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -window_size qcif -f sdl "SDL output"

   <b>sndio</b>
       sndio audio output device.

   <b>v4l2</b>
       Video4Linux2 output device.

   <b>xv</b>
       XV (XVideo) output device.

       This output device allows one to show a video stream in a X Window System window.

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>display_name</b>
           Specify the hardware display name, which determines the display and communications domain to be used.

           The  display  name  or   DISPLAY   environment   variable   can   be   a   string   in   the   format
           <u>hostname</u>[:<u>number</u>[.<u>screen_number</u>]].

           <u>hostname</u>  specifies  the name of the host machine on which the display is physically attached. <u>number</u>
           specifies the number of the display server on that host machine. <u>screen_number</u> specifies  the  screen
           to be used on that server.

           If unspecified, it defaults to the value of the DISPLAY environment variable.

           For   example,  "dual-headed:0.1"  would  specify  screen  1  of  display  0  on  the  machine  named
           ``dual-headed''.

           Check the X11 specification for more detailed information about the display name format.

       <b>window_id</b>
           When set to non-zero value then device doesn't create new window, but uses existing one with provided
           <u>window_id</u>. By default this options is set to zero and device creates its own window.

       <b>window_size</b>
           Set the created window size, can be a string of the form <u>width</u>x<u>height</u> or a video  size  abbreviation.
           If not specified it defaults to the size of the input video.  Ignored when <u>window_id</u> is set.

       <b>window_x</b>
       <b>window_y</b>
           Set  the X and Y window offsets for the created window. They are both set to 0 by default. The values
           may be ignored by the window manager.  Ignored when <u>window_id</u> is set.

       <b>window_title</b>
           Set the window title, if not specified default to the  filename  specified  for  the  output  device.
           Ignored when <u>window_id</u> is set.
