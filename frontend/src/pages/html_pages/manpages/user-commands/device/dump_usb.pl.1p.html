</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dump_usb.pl - Use Device::USB to list USB devices.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.37

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       The "dump_usb.pl" program provides a relatively crude dump of the information available from any USB
       devices installed on the system.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a Perl interface to the C library libusb. This library supports a relatively full
       set of functionality to access a USB device. In addition to the libusb, functioality, Device::USB
       provides a few convenience features that are intended to produce a more Perl-ish interface.

       If called without arguments, the program lists all installed USB devices on all busses. This is just a
       Data::Dumper dump of the structures, so it is not the most user friendly output in the world. (However,
       the program was only intended as a <u>quick</u> <u>hack</u> to verify that Device::USB was working.)

       If called with arguments, they are expected to be a vendor id and a product id.  (These arguments can be
       in hex if you precede them with "0x".) The program searches for a device that matches that vendor id and
       product id. If it finds one, the device <u>filename</u> is printed, along with the vendor and product ids.

       If the program can open the device, it will also print the manufacture name and product name as reported
       by the device.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       This module depends on the Device::USB and Data::Dumper modules, as well as the strict and warnings
       pragmas. Obviously, libusb must be available for Device::USB to function.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The output format is extremely non-friendly.

       The program only returns the first matching USB device.

       Please report any bugs or feature requests to "<a href="mailto:bug-maze-svg1@rt.cpan.org">bug-maze-svg1@rt.cpan.org</a>", or through the web interface
       at &lt;<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html">http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html</a>?Device::USB&gt;.  I will be notified, and then you'll
       automatically be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Thanks go to various members of the Houston Perl Mongers group for input on the module. But thanks mostly
       go to Paul Archer who proposed the project and helped with the development.
