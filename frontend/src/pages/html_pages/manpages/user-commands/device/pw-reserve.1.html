</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pw-reserve - The PipeWire device reservation utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pw-reserve</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Reserves a device using the DBus org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1 device reservation scheme [1], waiting
       until terminated by SIGINT or another signal.

       It can also request other applications to release a device. This can be used to make audio servers such
       as PipeWire, Pulseaudio, JACK, or other applications that respect the device reservation protocol, to
       ignore a device, or to release a sound device they are already using so that it can be used by other
       applications.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-r</b> <b>|</b> <b>--release</b>
           Request any client currently holding the device to release it, and try to reserve it after that. If
           this option is not given and the device is already in use, <b>pw-reserve</b> will exit with error status.

       <b>-n</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>|</b> <b>--name=NAME</b>
           Name of the device to reserve. By convention, this is

           â€¢ Audio<u>N</u>: for ALSA card number <u>N</u>

           <b>pw-reserve</b> can reserve any device name, however PipeWire does not currently support other values than
           listed above.

       <b>-a</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>|</b> <b>--appname=NAME</b>
           Application name to use when reserving the device.

       <b>-p</b> <b>PRIO</b> <b>|</b> <b>--priority=PRIO</b>
           Priority to use when reserving the device.

       <b>-m</b> <b>|</b> <b>--monitor</b>
           Monitor reservations of a given device, instead of reserving it.

       <b>-h</b> <b>|</b> <b>--help</b>
           Show help.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show version information.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  device  reservation  succeeds, <b>pw-reserve</b> does not exit until terminated with a signal. It exits
       with status 0 if terminated by SIGINT or SIGTERM in this case.

       Otherwise, it exits with nonzero exit status.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pw-reserve</b> -n Audio0

       Reserve ALSA card 0, and exit with error if it is already reserved.

       <b>pw-reserve</b> -n Audio0 -r

       Reserve ALSA card 0, requesting any applications that have reserved the device to release it for us.
