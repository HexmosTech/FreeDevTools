       amplist - List Atheros Device Addresses

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>amplist</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>device</u>] [<u>device</u>] [...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       print  the  local  device address or all network device addresses for a specific device.  This program is
       ideal for that special <b>script</b> <b>jokey</b> in your life.  It only prints device addresses.  Nothing else.

       Devices are detected using one of two methods.  The two methods can be used in combination  to  determine
       network topology.

       The  first method sends one VS_SW_VER message to the Qualcomm Atheros Local Management Address and prints
       the Ethernet source address found in each received confirmation message.  The  method  is  used  when  no
       device  addresses  appear  on  the  command  line.  The result is a list of all local devices, being this
       connected directly to the local host.  Each local device device may bridge to  an  independent  powerline
       network having remote devices as members.

       The  second  method  sends one VS_NW_INFO message to each specified device and prints the Ethernet source
       address found in each received message plus the Ethernet addresses of each network station identified  in
       that  message  body.   This  method is used whenever one, or more, device addresses appear on the command
       line.  It is possible to query remote powerline devices directly and so duplicate devices  addresses  are
       printed when devices share powerline neighbors.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the <b>plc</b> man page for an overview and
       installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>COMMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  is  identical  to  legacy  program  <b>int6klist</b>  but  uses version <b>1</b> of the Qualcomm Atheros
       <b>VS_NW_INFO</b> vendor-specific message.  Older firmware versions may not recognize this message version.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -<b>b</b>     Print bridge device addresses.  Each specified device reports it's own address. This option has no
              effect if no devices are specified.

       -<b>i</b>     Select the host Ethernet interface. All requests  are  sent  via  this  host  interface  and  only
              reponses  received  via  this host interface are recognized. The default interface is <b>eth1</b> because
              most people use <b>eth0</b> as their principle network connection; however, if environment  string  "PLC"
              is  defined then it takes precedence over the default interface. This option then takes precedence
              over either default.

       -<b>n</b>     Append a newline to output.

       -<b>q</b>     Enter quiet mode. This option has no effect at this time.

       -<b>r</b>     Print remote device addresses. Each specified  device  reports  neighbor  device  addresses.  This
              option has no effect when no devices are specified.

       -<b>s</b>     Insert a newline, instead of a space, between each device address.

       -<b>v</b>     Enter verbose mode. All Etherenet frames sent or received by the program are displayed on stdout.

       -<b>?</b>, --<b>help</b>
              Print  program  help  summary  on  stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the
              command line.

       -<b>!</b>, --<b>version</b>
              Print program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over  other  options  on
              the  command  line. Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that
              they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>device</b> The MAC address of some powerline device. More than one address may be specified. If  omitted  the
              the  program  output  consists  of local device addresses only. Otherwise, output conisists of the
              specified device followed by all devices associated with it. The default  address  is  <b>local</b>.  See
              <b>DEVICES</b> for information about symbolic device addresses.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       Powerline  devices  use  Ethernet  Media  Access Control (MAC) addresses. A MAC address is a 48-bit value
       entered as 12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case. Octets may  be  separated  with
       colons  for  clarity.  For example, "00b052000001", "00:b0:52:00:00:01" and "00b052:000001" are valid and
       equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       <b>all</b>    Same as "broadcast".

       <b>broadcast</b>
              A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast  address,  <b>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</b>.  All  devices,  whether  local,
              remote  or  foreign recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the
              far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       <b>local</b>  A  synonym  for  the  Qualcomm  Atheros  vendor   specific   Local   Management   Address   (LMA),
              <b>00:B0:52:00:00:01</b>. All local Atheros devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices
              do  not.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device
              is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       See the Qualcomm Atheros HomePlug AV Firmware Technical Reference Manual for more information.

</pre><h4><b>DISCLAIMER</b></h4><pre>
       Atheros HomePlug AV Vendor Specific Management Message Entry structure  and  content  is  proprietary  to
       Qualcomm  Atheros,  Ocala FL USA. Consequently, public information may not be available. Qualcomm Atheros
       reserves the right to modify message structure and  content  in  future  firmware  releases  without  any
       obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  command  lists all local devices. Since no devices are specified on the command line, one
       VS_SW_VER message is addressed to 00:B0:52:00:00:01 and the responses are collected. As we can see, there
       is only one local device available at this time. Observe that the prompt appears  immediately  after  the
       address because newlines are omitted by default.

          # amplist
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 #

       The  next  example  does the same thing but there are now three local devices available. Observe that all
       devices are printed without intervening newlines so that the output of this program can be used as  input
       to other toolkit programs.

          # amplist
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01 # int6k

       The  next example queries the first local device from the previous example, 00:B0:52:BE:EF:04, for a list
       neighbor devices. This time a VS_NW_INFO message is sent because we named a device on the  command  line.
       The  named  device  happens  to  be  a local device but it need not be. We can see that the device has no
       neighbors.

          # amplist 00:B0:52:BE:EF:04
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 # int6k

       The next example we query the next local device, 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02, and find that  it  has  two  neighbor
       devices  that  did  not  show  up earlier because they are remote devices. Observe that the three devices
       comprise a complete logical powerline network. Device 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 is connected to  the  local  host
       but 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 and 00:0f:00:F2:01:13 are connected to other hosts, somewhere.

          # amplist 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13

       The  next  example  shows  that we can query multiple devices at a time for neighbors. We have copied the
       output from the second example and pasted it onto the command line. We now have a list  of  all  devices,
       local and remote.

          # amplist 00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13

       This  next  example  does  the  same  thing but uses option <b>-n</b> to append a newline after each query. This
       output is eaiser to understand because each device queried starts on a new line and is  followed  by  any
       neighbors.

          # amplist 00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01 -n
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:01

       This  example  invokes  <b>amplist</b> which returns a list of local devices. That list is inserted into another
       <b>amplist</b> command line. This demontrates how program output can be used in scripts.

          # amplist $(amplist) -n
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:01

       This next example accomplishes the same thing since all local device respond with  a  list  of  powerline
       neighbors.

          # amplist local
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:01
