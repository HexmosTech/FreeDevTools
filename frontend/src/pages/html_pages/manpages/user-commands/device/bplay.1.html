</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bplay, brec - buffered sound recording/playing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bplay</b>  [-d  device] [-B buffersize] [-S] [-s speed] [-b bits] [[-t secs] | [-T samples]] [[-j secs] | [-J
       samples]] [-D level] [file]

       <b>brec</b> [-d device] [-B buffersize] [-S] [-s speed] [-b bits] [[-t secs]  |  [-T  samples]]  [-r|-v|-w]  [-D
       level] [file]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bplay</b>  copies data from the named sound file (or the standard input if no filename is given) to the audio
       device.

       <b>brec</b> copies data from the audio device to the named sound file (or the standard output if no filename  is
       present).

       These  programs  are  intended to be drop-in replacements for the <b>vplay</b> and <b>vrec</b> programs by Michael Beck
       (<a href="mailto:beck@informatik.hu-berlin.de">beck@informatik.hu-berlin.de</a>).

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <u>-B</u> <u>buffersize</u>
              Use the supplied audio buffer size instead of the default.

       <u>-d</u> <u>device</u>
              Use the supplied audio device instead of the default.

       <u>-S</u>     Sound file is stereo.

       <u>-s</u> <u>speed</u>
              The speed in samples per second.

       <u>-b</u> <u>bits</u>
              The number of bits per sample. Only 8 and 16 are currently supported.

       <u>-t</u> <u>secs</u>
              The number of seconds to be played or recorded.

       <u>-T</u> <u>samples</u>
              The number of samples to be played or recorded.

       <u>-j</u> <u>secs</u>
              When playing, the number of seconds to skip at the beginning of the input before playing.

       <u>-J</u> <u>samples</u>
              When playing, the number of samples to skip at the beginning of the input before playing.

       <u>-r</u>     When recording, write raw sound file.

       <u>-v</u>     When recording, write Creative Labs VOC sound file.

       <u>-w</u>     When recording write Microsoft Wave sound file. Note that the WAVE file format is limited to  4GiB
              filesize. Recording more data is possible, but the length info won't be consistent.

       <u>-q</u>     Quiet mode.  No messages are displayed.

       <u>-D</u> <u>level</u>
              Print  debug  information  to  stderr.  Debug  level  ranges  from  0  to  2,  where 0 is no debug
              information.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/dev/dsp</u> The audio device.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The -t, -T, -j and -J options may do strange things when playing VOC files.

       There are limitations on recording VOC format files - specifically VOC files are  only  recorded  in  the
       1.20  version  of the format, which some player programs may choke on. There is also currently a limit of
       around 16M on the size of a VOC file which will be recorded. This is probably not a problem since I don't
       think anybody really uses VOC files anymore.

       This program prefers to run setuid root. This is because it wants to use  setpriority()  to  run  at  the
       highest possible priority, and also locks down the buffers it uses to avoid them being swapped out.

       The option parsing code was originally taken from <b>vplay</b> to maintain compatibility.
