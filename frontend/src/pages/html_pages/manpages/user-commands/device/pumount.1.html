</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pumount - umount arbitrary hotpluggable devices as normal user

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pumount</b> [ <u>options</u> ] <u>device</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pumount  is  a  wrapper around the standard umount program which permits normal users to umount removable
       devices without a matching <a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a> entry.

       pumount also supports encrypted devices which use dm-crypt and have  LUKS  metadata.  If  a  LUKS-capable
       <b>cryptsetup</b>  is  installed, pumount will umount the mapped device instead and call cryptsetup to close the
       decrypted device afterwards.

       <b>pumount</b> expects the <u>device</u> as its only argument. This will umount <u>device</u> from a directory below <a href="file:/media">/media</a> if
       policy is met (see below).

       Please note that, as with <b>pmount</b>, you can use labels and uuids as described  in  <b>fstab</b>  (5)  for  devices
       present  in  <u><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></u>.   In this case, the device name need to match exactly the corresponding entry in
       <u><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></u>, including the <u>LABEL=</u> or <u>UUID=</u> part.

       <b>Important</b> <b>note</b> <b>for</b> <b>Debian:</b> The permission to execute pumount is restricted to members of the system group
       <b>plugdev</b>. Please add all desktop users who shall be able to use pmount to this group by executing

              <b>adduser</b> <u>user</u> <b>plugdev</b>

       (as root).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-l,</b> <b>--lazy</b>
              Lazy unmount. Detach the filesystem from the filesystem hierarchy now, and cleanup all  references
              to  the  filesystem  as  soon  as  it  is  not  busy  anymore.  (Requires kernel 2.4.11 or later.)
              <b>IMPORTANT</b> <b>NOTES</b> This option should not be used unless you <b>really</b>  know  what  you  are  doing,  as
              chances  are  high  that  it  will  result in data loss on the removable drive. Please run <b>pumount</b>
              manually and wait until it finishes. In addition, <b>pumount</b> will not <u>luksClose</u> a  device  which  was
              unmounted lazily.

       <b>--luks-force</b>
              Normally,  <b>pumount</b>  will  not <u>luksClose</u> (see <u><a href="../man1/cryptsetup.1.html">cryptsetup</a></u>(1)) a device <b>pmount</b> did not open. However,
              you can bypass this restriction with this flag. You probably will need it if you did  mess  around
              with the <u>/var/lock/pmount_luks</u> directory.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print a help message and exit successfully.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug</b>
              Enable verbose debug messages.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the current version number and exit successfully.

</pre><h4><b>POLICY</b></h4><pre>
       The umount will succeed if all of the following conditions are met:

       • <u>device</u> is a block device in <a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a> (it does not need to exist if <b>-l</b> is supplied)

       • <u>device</u>  is  not  in <a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a> (if it is, pmount executes  <b>umount</b>  <u>device</u> as the calling user to handle
         this transparently)

       • <u>device</u> is mounted according to <a href="file:/etc/mtab">/etc/mtab</a> and <a href="file:/proc/mounts">/proc/mounts</a> with the calling user's uid

       • mount point is in <a href="file:/media">/media</a>

</pre><h4><b>PUMOUNT</b> <b>AND</b> <b>MISSING</b> <b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pumount</b> now supports unmounting devices that have gone missing for some reason, such as a brutal  removal
       of the device, or a kernel/hardware problem. Just specify the mount point as argument for <b>pumount</b>.
