</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       int6klog - Qualcomm Atheros Log Retrieval Utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>int6klog</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>device</u>] [<u>device</u>] [...]  [&gt;<u>stdout</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Read  and  print  the  device watchdog and checkpoint report on stdout for subsequent analysis by Atheros
       Technical Support.  Report output is in XML format and contains base-64 encoded binary data  returned  by
       the device.  Aside from the XML tags, output is not in human readable format.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the <b>AMP</b> man page for an overview and
       installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -<b>C</b>     Return customer log.  This option has no effect unless used with option <b>-r</b> and is for EoC only.

       -<b>c</b>     Clear report.  This option is independent of options <b>-r</b> <b>and</b> <b>-C</b>.

       -<b>e</b>     Redirects  stderr  messages  to  stdout.   By  convention status and error messages are printed on
              stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout
              in cases where this is desired.

       -<b>f</b>     Specifies the output format.  Possible values are "xml" and "raw".  "xml" will output the watchdog
              and checkpoint log in the customer XML xlog format.  "raw" will output the  watchdog  log  in  the
              Engineering Device Manager .log format.

       -<b>i</b> <u>interface</u>
              Select  the  host  Ethernet  interface.   All  requests  are sent via this host interface and only
              reponses received via this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is  <b>eth1</b>  because
              most  people  use <b>eth0</b> as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC"
              is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.  This option then takes precedence
              over either default.

       -<b>q</b>     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -<b>r</b>     Read watchdog log.  This is not the default option and must be specified when needed.

       -<b>v</b>     Print additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps  incoming  and  outgoing
              packets which can be saved as text files for reference.

       -<b>?</b>,--<b>help</b>
              Print  program  help  summary  on  stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the
              command line.

       -<b>?</b>,--<b>version</b>
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other  options  on
              the  command line.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that
              they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>device</u> The MAC address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified.  If  more  than
              one  address  is  specified  then  operations  are  performed on each device in turn.  The default
              address is <b>local</b>.  See <b>DEVICES</b> for information about symbolic device addresses.

</pre><h4><b>LOGFILES</b></h4><pre>
       Log files are save in binary format by default but they can also be saved in XML format by adding  option
       <b>-x</b>  to  the command line.  By convention, binary log files have a <b>.log</b> extension and XML log files have a
       <b>.xlog</b> extension.  The extension is not critical but it helps us determine the format before we  open  the
       file.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       Powerline  devices  use  Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  MAC addresses are 12 hexadecimal
       digits (<b>0123456789ABCDEFabcdef</b>) in upper, lower or mixed case.  Individual octets  may  be  separated  by
       colons,   for  clarity,  but  not  all  octets  need  to  be  seperated.   For  example,  "00b052000001",
       "00:b0:52:00:00:01" and "00b052:000001" are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be expressed by name instead of number.

       <b>all</b>    Equivalent to "broadcast", described next.

       <b>broadcast</b>
              A synonym for the standard Ethernet broadcast address, <b>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</b>.   All  devices,  whether
              local, remote or foreign will respond to this address.

       <b>local</b>  A   synonym   for   the   Qualcomm   Atheros  vendor  specific  Local  Management  Address  (LMA),
              <b>00:B0:52:00:00:01</b>.  All local Atheros devices will recognize this address but remote  and  foreign
              devices  will  not.   A  remote  device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection.  A
              foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       See the Qualcomm Atheros HomePlug AV Firmware Technical Reference Manual for more information.

</pre><h4><b>DISCLAIMER</b></h4><pre>
       Atheros HomePlug AV Vendor Specific Management Message structure and content is  proprietary  to  Atheros
       Communications, Ocala FL USA.  Consequently, public information is not available.  Atheros Communications
       reserves  the  right  to  modify  message  structure  or  content in future firmware releases without any
       obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following example reads the Watchdog and Checkpoint Report from device <b>00:B0:52:BA:BE:02</b>  and  prints
       them  on  stdout  in  XML  format.  The output contains data segments formatted in base-64 notation which
       preserved data integrity when read or transmitted in text format.

          # int6klog 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02

       The next example does the same thing but pipes output to file <b>temp.log</b>.  Atheros recommends using a  <b>.log</b>
       extension for compatibility with the WIndows Device Manager.

          # int6klog 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 &gt; temp.log
