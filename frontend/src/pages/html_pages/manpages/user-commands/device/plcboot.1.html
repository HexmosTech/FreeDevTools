</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       plcboot - Qualcomm Atheros Panther/Lynx Powerline Device Bootstrapper

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>plcboot</b> [<u>options</u>] -<b>N</b> <u>file</u> -<b>P</b> <u>file</u> [<u>device</u>] [<u>device</u>] [...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Download  and  start  runtime  firmware  on  a  local  powerline device when it is in bootloader mode.  A
       powerline device enters bootloader mode if it has not flash memory or cannot  load  firmware  from  flash
       memory  for  some  reason.  You can use this progrm to start the device and then, optionally, permanently
       write a softloader, parameters and firmware into flash memory.

       Qualcomm Atheros introduced new boot methods with the <b>Lightning</b> chipset and new file  formats  and  flash
       methods  with  the  <b>Panther</b>  chipset.   This program supports the newer formats and methods.  It does not
       support the older formats and methods.  See programs <b>int6kboot</b> or <b>ampboot</b> to initialize earlier chipsets.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the <b>plc</b> man page for an overview and
       installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -<b>e</b>     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  Normally, status and error messages are  printed  on  stderr
              while  primary  program  output  is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in
              cases where this is desired.

       -<b>F</b>[<b>F</b>]  Flash or Force Flash NVRAM using either VS_MOD_NVM or VS_MODULE_OPERATION.  Adding a second <b>F</b> here
              or another -<b>F</b> anywhere on the command line will <b>force-flash</b> a blank or corrupted NVRAM.   Firmware
              loaded from NVRAM may treat force-flash as an error, depending of the firmware version.

       -<b>i</b> <u>interface</u>
              Select  the  host  Ethernet  interface.   All  requests  are sent via this host interface and only
              reponses received via this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is  <b>eth1</b>  because
              most  people  use <b>eth0</b> as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC"
              is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.  This option then takes precedence
              over either default.

       -<b>N</b> <u>filename</u>
              The file containing the firmware chain used to  boot  and  flash  the  device.   This  option  and
              argument  are  required  when  booting or flashing a device but may appear anywhere on the command
              line.  Invalid image files will be rejected.  No assumptions are made about  this  file  based  on
              filename and no filename conventions are enforced.

       -<b>P</b> <u>filename</u>
              The  file  containing  the  firmware  chain  used  to  boot and flash the device.  This option and
              argument are required when booting or flashing a device but may appear  anywhere  on  the  command
              line.   Invalid  image  files  will be rejected.  No assumptions are made about this file based on
              filename and no filename conventions are enforced.

       -<b>q</b>     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -<b>S</b> <u>filename</u>
              The file containing the softloader chain used to flash the device.  On prior versions of  plcboot,
              the presence of this option indicated that flash memory should be programmed but that is no longer
              the  case.   You  must now specify bot this option and option <b>-F</b> in order to program flash memory.
              This option and argument are required when flashing a  device  but  may  appear  anywhere  on  the
              command  line.   Invalid  image  files  will be rejected.  No assumptions are made about this file
              based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.

       -<b>t</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
              Read timeout in milliseconds.  Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This  is  the  maximum  time
              allowed for a response.  The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

       -<b>v</b>     Prints  additional  information  on  stdout.   In  particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet
              packets on stdout.

       -<b>?</b>,--<b>help</b>
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence  over  other  options  on  the
              command line.

       -<b>!</b>,--<b>version</b>
              Print  program  version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on
              the command line.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so  that
              they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>device</u> The Ethernet hardware address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified on
              the  command  line.   If  more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each
              device in turn.  The default address is <b>local</b>.  as explained in the <b>DEVICES</b> section.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       Powerline device addresses are 12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed  case.   Individual  octets
       may  be  separated  by  colons,  for  clarity, but colons are not required.  For example, "00b052000001",
       "00:b0:52:00:00:01" and "00b052:000001" are valid and equivalent.

       A <b>local</b> device is any Atheros Powerline Device connected directly to a host Ethernet interface.  A <b>remote</b>
       device is any Atheros Powerline Device at the far end of a powerline connection.  A <b>foreign</b> device is any
       powerline device not manufactured by Atheros.

       Common device addresses have symbolic names that can be used in place of the actual address  value.   The
       following symbolic addresses are recognized by this program and most other toolkit programs.

       <b>all</b>    Equivalent to "broadcast", described next.

       <b>broadcast</b>
              A  synonym  for  the  Ethernet  broadcast address, <b>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</b>.  All devices, whether local,
              remote or foreign will respond to this address.

       <b>local</b>  A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros Local Management Address (LMA), <b>00:B0:52:00:00:01</b>.   All  local
              Atheros devices will respond to this address but remote and foreign devices will not.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       See  the Qualcomm Atheros HomePlug AV Firmware Technical Reference Manual for technical information.  See
       the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit Online Documetation for practical information and examples.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This example boots a powerline device by  downloading  runtime  parameters  and  firmware  then  starting
       firmware  execution.   The  actual  boot method used will depend on the file formats and powerline device
       type detected by the program.  The output shown here is typical for panther and lynx chipsets.  Option <b>-P</b>
       and <b>-N</b> are required but their order is not important.  Tne MAC address may be omitted  beccause  it  will
       default to 00:B0:52:00:00:01 which is also the default bootloader device address.  On completion, runtime
       firmware is executing in SDRAM but flash memory has not been programmed.  If This operation is common for
       flash-less devices.  If we reset the device at this point then it will return to bootloader mode.

          # plcboot -P AR7420.pib -N AR7400.nvm
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 BootLoader is running

          eth1 00:B0:52:BA:BE:88 MAC-QCA7420ES-0.9.0.278-0-20110914-INTERNAL is running

       The  next  example  boots  a  device,  as before, then flashes the same parameters and firmware into non-
       volatile memory attached to the device.  Observe that a softloader is required and  will  be  written  to
       flash memory before runtime parameters and firmware.  The softloader need only be written once when first
       programming  a  blank flash memory.  Option <b>-FF</b> is optional but permitted for backward compatibility with
       programs <b>ampboot</b> and <b>int6kboot</b>.

          # plcboot -P AR7420.pib -N AR7400.nvm -S AR7420-softloader.nvm -FF
