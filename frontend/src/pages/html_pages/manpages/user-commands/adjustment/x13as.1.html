</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       x13as - the X-13ARIMA-SEATS Seasonal Adjustment Program

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>x13as</b> <b>[</b><u>args</u><b>...]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       X-13ARIMA-SEATS computes the seasonal adjustment of one or several time series.

       Each  argument  is  either  a filename (whose extension should not be specified and will be automatically
       figured by <u>x13as</u>) or an option flag.

       The operations to be performed are described by <u>specification</u> <u>files</u>  (whose  extension  is  <u>.spc</u>);  their
       format is not documented in this manpage (see the reference manual linked below).

       There are three operation modes:

       1. Operation on one series
              The  specification  file should be given as the first filename; an optional second filename can be
              given for the output (otherwise the default is to use  the  same  basename  as  the  specification
              file).   Alternatively the specification file can be given with the <u>-i</u> option, and the output file
              with the <u>-o</u> option.

       2. Operation on multiple series, with multiple specifications
              A metafile (with extension <u>.mta</u>), containing the list of specification files (and  optionally  the
              corresponding output files), should be given as the argument of the <u>-m</u> option.

       3. Operation on multiple series, with single specification
              The  specification  should  be  given  as  in the first filename.  A data metafile (with extension
              <u>.dta</u>), containing the list of datafiles with extension  <u>.dat</u>  (and  optionally  the  corresponding
              output files) should be given as the argument of the <u>-d</u> option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -c     Sum  each  of  the  components  of  a  composite adjustment, but only perform modeling or seasonal
              adjustment on the total

       -d filename
              Filename (without extension) for data metafile

       -g dirname
              Directory where graphics metafile and related files for input to external  graphics  programs  are
              stored

       -i filename
              Filename (without extension) for input specification file

       -m filename
              Filename (without extension) for input metafile

       -n     (No tables) Only tables specifically requested in the input specification file will be printed out

       -o filename
              Filename (without extension) used for all output files gener- ated during this run of the program

       -p     No pagination is used in main output file

       -q     Run X-13ARIMA-SEATS in quiet-mode (warning messages not sent to the console)

       -r     Produce reduced X-13ARIMA-SEATS output (as in GiveWin version of X-13ARIMA-SEATS)

       -s     Store seasonal adjustment and regARIMA model diagnostics in a file

       -t     Store  timing  information  in  the  diagnostics  file  (if  <u>-s</u> or <u>-g</u> not specified, will generate
              diagnostic file)

       -v     Only check input specification file(s) for errors; no other pro- cessing

       -w     Wide (132 character) format is used in main output file

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       Output files will be created with the <u>.out</u> extension, using by default the basename of the  specification
       or data files.

       Error files may be created with the <u>.err</u> extension, with the same basename as the specification file.

       A  log file will be created with the <u>.log</u> extension, using the basename of either the specification file,
       the metafile or the data metafile, depending on the operation mode.
