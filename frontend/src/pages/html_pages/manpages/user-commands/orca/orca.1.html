</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       orca - a scriptable screen reader

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>orca</b> [<u>option...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>orca</b> is a screen reader for people with visual impairments, it provides alternative access to the desktop
       by using speech synthesis and braille.

       <b>orca</b>  works  with  applications  and  toolkits  that  support  the  Assistive Technology Service Provider
       Interface (AT-SPI), which is the primary assistive  technology  infrastructure  for  Linux  and  Solaris.
       Applications and toolkits supporting the AT-SPI include the GNOME Gtk+ toolkit, the Java platform's Swing
       toolkit, LibreOffice, Gecko, and WebKitGtk. AT-SPI support for the KDE Qt toolkit is being pursued.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-s,</b> <b>--setup</b>
              When starting <b>orca</b>, initiate the GUI-based configuration.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--user-prefs-dir=</b><u>dirname</u>
              When starting <b>orca</b>, use <u>dirname</u> as an alternate directory for the user preferences.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--enable=</b><u>speech|braille|braille-monitor</u>
              When starting <b>orca</b>, force the enabling of the supplied options.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--disable=</b><u>speech|braille|braille-monitor</u>
              When starting <b>orca</b>, force the disabling of the supplied options.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--list-apps</b>
              Prints  the names of all the currently running applications.  This is used primarily for debugging
              purposes to see if <b>orca</b> can talk to the  accessibility  infrastructure.   Note  that  if  <b>orca</b>  is
              already  running,  this  will  not  kill  the other <b>orca</b> process.  It will just list the currently
              running applications, and you will see <b>orca</b> listed twice: once for the existing <b>orca</b> and once  for
              this instance.

       <b>--debug</b>
              Enables debug output for <b>orca</b> and sends all debug output to a file with a name of the form 'debug-
              YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS.out'  in  the  current  directory.   The  YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS  portion will be
              replaced with the current date and time.

       <b>--debug-file=</b><u>filename</u>
              Enables debug output for <b>orca</b> and sends all debug output to the given filename.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              outputs <b>orca</b> version number and exits.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              displays <b>orca</b> help and exits.

       <b>--replace</b>
              Replace a currently running <b>orca</b> process.  By default, if <b>orca</b> detects an  existing  <b>orca</b>  process
              for  the  same  session,  it will not start a new <b>orca</b> process.  This option will kill and cleanup
              after any existing <b>orca</b> process and then start a new <b>orca</b> in its place.

       <b>KEYBOARD</b> <b>SETTINGS</b>
              Orca provides two keyboard modes, Desktop and Laptop keyboard layout.  The  <b>Orca_Modifier</b>  key  is
              <b>Insert</b> in desktop keyboard layout and <b>Caps_Lock</b> in laptop keyboard layout.

              <b>Orca</b>  uses  default  GNOME  keyboard  shortcuts  to navigate the desktop and interact with various
              applications. The flat review commands provide an alternative method  of  interaction  in  certain
              inaccessible  applications.  It  should not be confused with flat review functionality provided by
              other screen readers.
