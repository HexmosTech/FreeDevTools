</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ipmctl-delete-goal - Deletes the memory allocation goal from PMem modules

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           ipmctl delete [OPTIONS] -goal [TARGETS]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Deletes the memory allocation goal from one or more PMem modules. This command only deletes a memory
       allocation goal request that has not yet been processed by platform firmware (BIOS).

       If the PMem module target is used and the specified PMem modules do not include all PMem modules that are
       part of a memory allocation goal request the result will be PMem modules (those not included) that have a
       broken request which will be rejected by platform firmware (BIOS) upon the next reboot.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h, -help
           Displays help for the command.

       -ddrt
           Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

       -smbus
           Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

           <b>Note</b>

           The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

       -lpmb
           Used to specify large transport payload size for the current invocation of ipmctl.

       -spmb
           Used to specify small transport payload size for the current invocation of ipmctl.

           <b>Note</b>

           The -lpmb and -spmb options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

       -o (text|nvmxml), -output (text|nvmxml)
           Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".

</pre><h4><b>TARGETS</b></h4><pre>
       -dimm [DimmIDs]
           Deletes the memory allocation goal from specific PMem modules by optionally supplying one or more
           comma separated PMem module identifiers. The default is to delete the memory allocation goals from
           all manageable PMem modules.

       -socket [SocketIDs]
           Deletes the memory allocation goal from the PMem modules on specific sockets by supplying the socket
           target and one or more comma separated socket identifiers. The default is to delete the memory
           allocation goals from manageable PMem modules on all sockets.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Deletes the memory allocation goal from all PMem modules on all sockets.

           ipmctl delete -goal

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In order to successfully execute this command:

       •   The caller must have the appropriate privileges.

       •   The specified PMem modules must be manageable by the host software and unlocked if security is
           enabled.

       •   Given socket and all specified PMem modules must contain a memory allocation goal.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       For each PMem module, the CLI will indicate the status of the operation. If a failure occurs when
       deleting the memory allocation goals from multiple PMem modules, the process will output a failure
       message for those PMem modules that failed and a success message for those that succeeded.

</pre><h4><b>SAMPLE</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
           Delete memory allocation goal from PMem module (DimmID): Success

           Delete memory allocation goal from PMem module (DimmID): Error (Code) - (Description)
