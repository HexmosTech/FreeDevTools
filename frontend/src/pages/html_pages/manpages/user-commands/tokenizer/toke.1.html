       toke - OpenBIOS tokenizer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>toke</b> <u>[options]</u> <u>forth-file</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>toke</b> is an open-source FCode Tokenizer from the OpenBIOS project.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>-?</b> Print a brief help message and then exit.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--ignore-errors</b>
              Generate a Binary Output even if errors were reported.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--load-list</b>
              Collect  the  names  of <u>fload</u>ed files into an FLoad-List file. The names collected are in the same
              form as they were presented in the <u>fload</u> statements.
              The name of the FLoad-List File is derived from the name of the binary output file,  by  replacing
              its extension with <u>.fl</u> , or, if the binary output file name had no extension, merely appending the
              extension <u>.fl</u>.
              The binary output file name used for this purpose is either the one specified on the command line,
              or the one created by default.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--output-name</b> <u>OutputFileName</u>,
              Direct  the  binary  output  (FCode  result  of  Tokenization) to the named file instead of to the
              default-named file. This option is not valid when multiple input files are named.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--dependencies</b>
              Collect the fully-resolved pathnames of floaded and ENCODEd files  into  a  dependency-list  file.
              The  names  collected  are  in  the  form  that  is  presented to the host operating system: shell
              environment Variables and related expressions will be fully expanded, and the directory within the
              include-list in which the file was found will be attached.
              The name of the dependency-list file will be the same as that of the FLoad-list file, except  that
              its extension will be <u>.P</u> instead of <u>.fl</u>.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Print additional messages (including advisories) during tokenization.

       <b>-I,</b> <b>--Include</b> <u>directory</u>
              This  tokenizer  supports  the  notion  of  an  include-list. The user creates the include-list by
              specifying a number of <u>-I</u> <u>directory</u> pairs on the command-line.  All  file-reads,  whether  for  an
              fload  command  or  an encode-file directive, will involve a search for the named file through the
              directories of the include-list, in the order they were supplied on the command-line.
              If no include-list is created, file-reads are relative to the current  working  Directory.  If  an
              include-list  is created, file-reads are restricted to the directories within it.  For the current
              working directory to be included in the file-search, it must be specified explicitly.   <b>-I.</b>   will
              accomplish that quite effectively.

       <b>-T,</b> <b>--Trace</b> <u>symbol</u>
              This  tokenizer supports the notion of a trace-list. The User creates the trace-list by specifying
              a number of <u>-T</u> <u>symbol</u> pairs on the command-line.
              When a name is defined, whether as an FCode, an alias, a Macro or anything else, either in  normal
              tokenization  mode  or  "Tokenizer Escape"‐mode, if it matches a symbol that has been added to the
              trace list, a trace note message will be issued indicating that a definition of that name has been
              created.  Subsequent trace note Messages will be issued  when  the  definition  of  that  name  is
              invoked.
              This  trace-symbols  feature  can be helpful during maintenance of legacy code, for instance, when
              multiple symbols carry the same name.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--define</b> <u>Symbol[=Value]</u>
              Define a command-line symbol and optionally, assign a value to  it.  If  you  wish  the  <u>value</u>  to
              contain  spaces  or  quotes,  you  can  accomplish  that  using the shell escape conventions. This
              sequence may be repeated. Once a Symbol is defined on the command-line, it stays in effect for the
              duration of the entire batch of tokenizations (i.e., if there are multiple input  files  named  on
              the command line). Command-line Symbols can be tested for purposes of conditional tokenization, or
              their assigned values can be evaluated.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--flag</b> <u>[no]&lt;FlagName&gt;</u>
              The  tokenizer  recognizes a specific set of special-feature flag-names; each is associated with a
              specific non-standard variant behavior. Pass the flag-name as an argument  to  the  <u>-f</u>  switch  to
              enable the behavior; to disable it, precede the flag-name with the optional string <u>no</u>.
              The  settings of the special-feature flags can also be changed or displayed from within the source
              input file.
              The special-feature flags are all initially set to be enabled, except where noted.
              The flag-names and their associated special-features are as follows:

              <b>Local-Values</b>
                     Support IBM-style Local Values ("LV"s). Initially disabled.

              <b>LV-Legacy-Separator</b>
                     Allow Semicolon for Local Values Separator ("Legacy").

              <b>LV-Legacy-Message</b>
                     Display a Warning Message when Semicolon is used as the Local Values Separator.

              <b>ABORT-Quote</b>
                     Allow ABORT" macro.

              <b>Sun-ABORT-Quote</b>
                     ABORT" with implicit IF ... THEN

              <b>Abort-Quote-Throw</b>
                     Use -2 THROW, rather than ABORT, in an Abort" phrase

              <b>String-remark-escape</b>
                     Allow "\ (Quote-Backslash) to interrupt string parsing.

              <b>Hex-remark-escape</b>
                     Allow \ (Backslash) to interrupt hex-sequence parsing within a string.

              <b>C-Style-string-escape</b>
                     Allow the C-style String-Escape pairs \n \t and \xx\ to be treated as special characters in
                     string parsing.

              <b>Always-Headers</b>
                     Override occurrences of the standard directive headerless in the source with -- effectively
                     -- headers to make all definitions have a header. Occurrences  of  the  directive  external
                     will continue to behave in the standard manner. Initially disabled.

              <b>Always-External</b>
                     All  definitions will be made as though under the external directive; occurrences of either
                     Standard directive headerless or headers in the source will be  overridden.  This  special-
                     feature  flag  will also override the <u>Always-Headers</u> special-feature flag in the event that
                     both have been specified. Initially disabled.

              <b>Warn-if-Duplicate</b>
                     Display a WARNING message whenever a definition is made whose name duplicates  that  of  an
                     existing  definition.   Disabling this flag will suspend the duplicate-names test globally,
                     until it is re-enabled. A Directive is  supported  that  will  suspend  the  test  for  the
                     duration of only a single definition, without affecting global behavior.

              <b>Obsolete-FCode-Warning</b>
                     Display  a  WARNING  message  whenever  an  FCode  function  is  invoked  that the Standard
                     identifies as obsolete.

              <b>Trace-Conditionals</b>
                     Issue advisory messages  about  the  state  of  conditional  tokenization.  (Remember  that
                     advisory messages are displayed only if the <u>verbose</u> option <u>-v</u> is set.) Initially disabled.

              <b>Upper-Case-Token-Names</b>
                     <b>Lower-Case-Token-Names</b> When outputting the names of headered functions (<b>token-names</b>) to the
                     binary  output file, override the character-case in which the names appeared in the source,
                     and convert them to <u>Upper-</u> or <u>Lower-</u> ‐Case, respectively. (These flags do not  affect  text
                     string sequences, whose character-case is always preserved.)  Initially disabled.

              <b>Big-End-PCI-Rev-Level</b>
                     Save  the  <b>Revision</b>  <b>Level</b>  of the Vendor's ROM field of the PCI Header in big-endian byte-
                     order, rather than little-endian as per the general PCI  Standard  convention.  (This  flag
                     does not affect any other field
                      of the PCI Header). Initially disabled.

              <b>Ret-Stk-Interp</b>
                     Allow  return-stack  operations  during  interpretation.  While the standard specifies that
                     usage of the operators <b>&gt;r</b>, <b>r@</b>, and <b>r&gt;</b> while interpreting is allowed, actual practice in the
                     industry is inconsistent.  Developers who wish to take a more  cautious  approach  to  this
                     question  can  disable this flag so that any attempt to use the operators <b>&gt;r</b>, <b>r@</b>, and <b>r&gt;</b> in
                     the interpreting state will generate an ERROR Message.

       Also, the pseudo-flag-name <u>help</u> will cause a list of the flag-names and their associated special-features
       to be printed.
