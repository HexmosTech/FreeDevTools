</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dialog - display dialog boxes from shell scripts

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dialog</b> <b>--clear</b>
       <b>dialog</b> <b>--create-rc</b> <u>file</u>
       <b>dialog</b> <b>--print-maxsize</b>
       <b>dialog</b> <u>common-options</u> <u>box-options</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Dialog</b>  is  a  program  that will let you present a variety of questions or display messages using dialog
       boxes from a shell script.  These types of dialog boxes are implemented (though not all  are  necessarily
       compiled into <b>dialog</b>):

              <b>buildlist</b>, <b>calendar</b>, <b>checklist</b>, <b>dselect</b>, <b>editbox</b>, <b>form</b>, <b>fselect</b>, <b>gauge</b>, <b>infobox</b>, <b>inputbox</b>,
              <b>inputmenu</b>, <b>menu</b>, <b>mixedform</b>, <b>mixedgauge</b>, <b>msgbox</b> (message), <b>passwordbox</b>, <b>passwordform</b>, <b>pause</b>,
              <b>prgbox</b>, <b>programbox</b>, <b>progressbox</b>, <b>radiolist</b>, <b>rangebox</b>, <b>tailbox</b>, <b>tailboxbg</b>, <b>textbox</b>, <b>timebox</b>,
              <b>treeview</b>, and <b>yesno</b> (yes/no).

       You can put more than one dialog box into a script:

       •   Use  the  "<b>--and-widget</b>"  token to force <b>dialog</b> to proceed to the next dialog unless you have pressed
           ESC to cancel, or

       •   Simply add the tokens for the next dialog box, making a chain.  Dialog stops chaining when the return
           code from a dialog is nonzero, e.g., Cancel or No (see DIAGNOSTICS).

       Some widgets, e.g., checklist, will write text to <b>dialog</b>'s output.  Normally that is the standard  error,
       but there are options for changing this: “<b>--output-fd</b>”, “<b>--stderr</b>” and “<b>--stdout</b>”.  No text is written if
       the Cancel button (or ESC) is pressed; <b>dialog</b> exits immediately in that case.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All  options  begin  with  “<b>--</b>”  (two ASCII hyphens, for the benefit of those using systems with deranged
       locale support).

       A “<b>--</b>” by itself is used as an escape, i.e., the next token on the command-line  is  not  treated  as  an
       option.   This  is  different  from  <b><a href="../man1/getopt.1.html">getopt</a></b>(1),  which  uses  that token to treat the remaining tokens as
       <u>parameters</u> rather than <u>options</u>.

              <b>dialog</b> <b>--title</b> <b>--</b> <b>--Not</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b>
              <b>dialog</b> <b>--title</b> <b>This</b> <b>--</b> <b>--title</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b>

       <b>Dialog</b> uses no <u>parameters</u>, and uses its own <u>options</u> parser.

       When a common (e.g., non-widget) option is repeated, the last found is the one  that  is  used.   Boolean
       options are handled specially so they can be cancelled, by adding (or omitting) a “no” modifier after the
       leading “<b>--</b>”.  For instance, <b>--no-shadow</b> is documented here, but <b>--shadow</b> also is accepted.

       The  “<b>--args</b>”  option  tells  <b>dialog</b>  to list the command-line parameters to the standard error.  This is
       useful when debugging complex scripts using  the  “<b>--</b>”  and  “<b>--file</b>”,  since  the  command-line  may  be
       rewritten as these are expanded.

       The “<b>--file</b>” option tells <b>dialog</b> to read parameters from the file named as its value.
              <b>dialog</b> <b>--file</b> <u>parameterfile</u>

       Blanks  not  within double-quotes are discarded (use backslashes to quote single characters).  The result
       is inserted into the command-line, replacing “<b>--file</b>”  and  its  option  value.   Interpretation  of  the
       command-line  resumes from that point.  If <u>parameterfile</u> begins with “&amp;”, <b>dialog</b> interprets the following
       text as a file descriptor number rather than a filename.

       Most widgets accept <u>height</u> and <u>width</u> parameters, which can be used to automatically size  the  widget  to
       accommodate multi-line message <u>prompt</u> values:

       •   If the parameter is negative, <b>dialog</b> uses the screen's size.

       •   If the parameter is zero, <b>dialog</b> uses minimum size for the widget to display the <u>prompt</u> and data.

       •   Otherwise, <b>dialog</b> uses the given size for the widget.

   <b>Common</b> <b>Options</b>
       Most of the common options are reset before processing each widget.

       <b>--ascii-lines</b>
              Rather  than draw graphics lines around boxes, draw ASCII “+” and “-” in the same place.  See also
              “<b>--no-lines</b>”.

       <b>--aspect</b> <u>ratio</u>
              This gives you some control over the box dimensions when  using  auto  sizing  (specifying  0  for
              height and width).  It represents width / height.  The default is 9, which means 9 characters wide
              to every 1 line high.

       <b>--backtitle</b> <u>backtitle</u>
              Specifies a <u>backtitle</u> string to be displayed on the backdrop, at the top of the screen.

       <b>--begin</b> <u>y</u> <u>x</u>
              Specify the position of the upper left corner of a dialog box on the screen.

       <b>--cancel-label</b> <u>string</u>
              Override the label used for “Cancel” buttons.

       <b>--clear</b>
              Clears  the  widget  screen,  keeping only the screen_color background.  Use this when you combine
              widgets with “<b>--and-widget</b>” to erase the contents of a previous widget on the screen, so it  won't
              be  seen  under  the  contents  of  a  following  widget.   Understand  this  as the complement of
              “<b>--keep-window</b>”.  To compare the effects, use these:

              All three widgets visible, staircase effect, ordered 1,2,3:

              dialog \
                                             --begin 2 2 --yesno "" 0 0 \
                  --and-widget               --begin 4 4 --yesno "" 0 0 \
                  --and-widget               --begin 6 6 --yesno "" 0 0

              Only the last widget is left visible:

              dialog \
                               --clear       --begin 2 2 --yesno "" 0 0 \
                  --and-widget --clear       --begin 4 4 --yesno "" 0 0 \
                  --and-widget               --begin 6 6 --yesno "" 0 0

              All three widgets visible, staircase effect, ordered 3,2,1:

              dialog \
                               --keep-window --begin 2 2 --yesno "" 0 0 \
                  --and-widget --keep-window --begin 4 4 --yesno "" 0 0 \
                  --and-widget               --begin 6 6 --yesno "" 0 0

              First and third widget visible, staircase effect, ordered 3,1:

              dialog \
                               --keep-window --begin 2 2 --yesno "" 0 0 \
                  --and-widget --clear       --begin 4 4 --yesno "" 0 0 \
                  --and-widget               --begin 6 6 --yesno "" 0 0

              Note, if you want to restore original console colors and send your cursor home  after  the  dialog
              program  has  exited,  use  the <b><a href="../man1/clear.1.html">clear</a></b>(1) command.  Conversely, if you want to clear the screen and
              send  your  cursor  to  the  lower  left  after  the  <b>dialog</b>   program   has   exited,   use   the
              <b>--erase-on-exit</b> option.

       <b>--color-mode</b> <u>code</u>
              Extend  the  <b>--colors</b>  option to the content of programbox, tailbox and textbox.  Use code “2” for
              this feature.

       <b>--colors</b>
              Interpret embedded “\Z” sequences in the dialog text  by  the  following  character,  which  tells
              <b>dialog</b> to set colors or video attributes:

              •   0  through  7  are  the  ANSI  color  numbers used in curses: black, red, green, yellow, blue,
                  magenta, cyan and white respectively.

              •   Bold is set by 'b', reset by 'B'.

              •   Reverse is set by 'r', reset by 'R'.

              •   Underline is set by 'u', reset by 'U'.

              •   The settings are cumulative, e.g., “\Zb\Z1” makes the following  text  bold  (perhaps  bright)
                  red.

              •   Restore normal settings with “\Zn”.

       <b>--column-separator</b> <u>string</u>
              Tell  <b>dialog</b>  to split data for radio/checkboxes and menus on the occurrences of the given string,
              and to align the split data into columns.

       <b>--cr-wrap</b>
              Interpret embedded newlines in the dialog text as a newline on the screen.  Otherwise, <b>dialog</b> will
              only wrap lines where needed to fit inside the text box.

              Even though you can control line breaks with this, <b>Dialog</b> will still wrap any lines that  are  too
              long  for the width of the box.  Without cr-wrap, the layout of your text may be formatted to look
              nice in the source code of your script without affecting the way it will look in the dialog.

              The <u>cr-wrap</u> feature is implemented subject to these conditions:

              •   the string contains “\n” and the <b>--no-nl-expand</b> option is not used, or

              •   the <b>--trim</b> option is used.

              For more information, see <b>Whitespace</b> <b>Options</b>.

       <b>--create-rc</b> <u>file</u>
              When <b>dialog</b> supports run-time configuration, this can be used to dump a sample configuration  file
              to the file specified by <u>file</u>.

       <b>--cursor-off-label</b>
              Place  the  terminal cursor at the end of a button instead of on the first character of the button
              label.  This is useful to reduce visual confusion when the cursor coloration interacts poorly with
              the button-label text colors.

       <b>--date-format</b> <u>format</u>
              If the host provides <b>strftime</b>, this option allows you to specify the format of  the  date  printed
              for the <b>--calendar</b> widget.  The time of day (hour, minute, second) are the current local time.

       <b>--defaultno</b>
              Make the default value of the <b>yes/no</b> box a <b>No</b>.  Likewise, treat the default button of widgets that
              provide  “OK”  and  “Cancel”  as  a  <u>Cancel</u>.   If “<b>--no-cancel</b>” or “<b>--visit-items</b>” are given those
              options overrides this, making the default button always “Yes” (internally the same as “OK”).

       <b>--default-button</b> <u>string</u>
              Set the default (preselected) button in a widget.  By preselecting a button,  a  script  makes  it
              possible for the user to simply press <u>Enter</u> to proceed through a dialog with minimum interaction.

              The option's value is the name of the button: <u>ok</u>, <u>yes</u>, <u>cancel</u>, <u>no</u>, <u>help</u> or <u>extra</u>.

              Normally  the first button in each widget is the default.  The first button shown is determined by
              the widget together with the “<b>--no-ok</b>” and “<b>--no-cancel</b>” options.  If this option  is  not  given,
              there is no default button assigned.

       <b>--default-item</b> <u>string</u>
              Set  the default item in a checklist, form or menu box.  Normally the first item in the box is the
              default.

       <b>--erase-on-exit</b>
              When <b>dialog</b> exits, remove the dialog widget, erasing the entire screen to  its  native  background
              color, and place the terminal cursor at the lower left corner.

       <b>--exit-label</b> <u>string</u>
              Override the label used for “EXIT” buttons.

       <b>--extra-button</b>
              Show an extra button, between “OK” and “Cancel” buttons.

              The extra button appears between “Yes” and “No” for the <u>yesno</u> widget.

       <b>--extra-label</b> <u>string</u>
              Override  the  label  used  for  “Extra”  buttons.   Note: for inputmenu widgets, this defaults to
              “Rename”.

       <b>--help</b> Prints the help message to the standard output and exits.  The help message is also printed if  no
              options are given, or if an unrecognized option is given.

       <b>--help-button</b>
              Show  a  help-button  after  “OK”  and “Cancel” buttons in boxes which have a list of tagged items
              (i.e., checklist, radiolist, menu, and treeview boxes).

              The help-button appears after “Yes” and “No” for the <u>yesno</u> widget.

              On exit, the return status indicates that the Help button  was  pressed.   <b>Dialog</b>  also  writes  a
              message to its output after the token “HELP”:

              •   If "<b>--item-help</b>" is also given, the item-help text is written.

              •   Otherwise, the item's tag (the first field) is written.

              You  can use the <b>--help-tags</b> option and/or set the DIALOG_ITEM_HELP environment variable to modify
              these messages and exit-status.

              This option can be applied to other widgets, which  have  an  “OK”  button,  whether  or  not  the
              “Cancel”  button  is  used.   The return status and output are not treated specially for the other
              widgets; the help-button is just an extra button.

       <b>--help-label</b> <u>string</u>
              Override the label used for “Help” buttons.

       <b>--help-status</b>
              If the help-button is selected, writes the checklist, radiolist  or  form  information  after  the
              item-help  “HELP”  information.   This  can  be used to reconstruct the state of a checklist after
              processing the help request.

       <b>--help-tags</b>
              Modify the messages written on exit for <b>--help-button</b> by making them always just the  item's  tag.
              This does not affect the exit status code.

       <b>--hfile</b> <u>filename</u>
              Display the given file using a textbox when the user presses F1.

       <b>--hline</b> <u>string</u>
              Display the given string centered at the bottom of the widget.

       <b>--ignore</b>
              Ignore  options that <b>dialog</b> does not recognize.  Some well-known ones such as “<b>--icon</b>” are ignored
              anyway, but this is a better choice for compatibility with other implementations.

       <b>--input-fd</b> <u>fd</u>
              Read keyboard input from the given file descriptor.  Most <b>dialog</b> scripts read  from  the  standard
              input, but the gauge widget reads a pipe (which is always standard input).  Some configurations do
              not  work  properly  when  <b>dialog</b> tries to reopen the terminal.  Use this option (with appropriate
              juggling of file-descriptors) if your script must work in that type of environment.

       <b>--insecure</b>
              Makes the password widget friendlier but less secure, by echoing asterisks for each character.

       <b>--iso-week</b>
              Set the starting point for the week-number shown in the “<b>--calendar</b>” option according to ISO-8601,
              which starts numbering with the first week which includes a Thursday in January.

       <b>--item-help</b>
              Interpret the tags data for checklist, radiolist and menu boxes adding a column which is displayed
              in the bottom line of the screen, for the currently selected item.

       <b>--keep-tite</b>
              When built with <b>ncurses</b>, <b>dialog</b> normally checks to see if it is running in an <b>xterm</b>, and  in  that
              case  tries  to  suppress  the  initialization  strings that would make it switch to the alternate
              screen.  Switching between the normal and alternate screens is visually distracting  in  a  script
              which  runs  <b>dialog</b>  several  times.   Use this option to allow <b>dialog</b> to use those initialization
              strings.

       <b>--keep-window</b>
              Normally when <b>dialog</b> performs several <b>tailboxbg</b> widgets connected by “<b>--and-widget</b>”, it clears the
              old widget from the screen by painting over it.  Use this option to suppress that repainting.

              At exit, <b>dialog</b> repaints all of the widgets which have been marked with “<b>--keep-window</b>”,  even  if
              they  are  not  <b>tailboxbg</b>  widgets.   That  causes them to be repainted in reverse order.  See the
              discussion of the “<b>--clear</b>” option for examples.

       <b>--last-key</b>
              At exit, report the last key which the user entered.  This is the curses key code  rather  than  a
              symbol  or  literal character, and is only reported for keys which are bound to an action.  It can
              be used by scripts to distinguish between two keys which are bound to the same action.

       <b>--max-input</b> <u>size</u>
              Limit input strings to the given size.  If not specified, the limit is 2048.

       <b>--no-cancel</b>
              Suppress the “Cancel” button in checklist, inputbox and menu box modes.  A script can  still  test
              if the user pressed the ESC key to cancel to quit.

       <b>--no-collapse</b>
              Normally  <b>dialog</b>  converts  tabs  to spaces and reduces multiple spaces to a single space for text
              which is displayed in a message boxes, etc.  Use this option to disable that feature.   Note  that
              <b>dialog</b> will still wrap text, subject to the “<b>--cr-wrap</b>” and “<b>--trim</b>” options.

              The <u>no-collapse</u> feature is implemented subject to these conditions:

              •   the string contains “\n” and the <b>--no-nl-expand</b> option is not used, or

              •   the <b>--trim</b> option is not used.

              For more information, see <b>Whitespace</b> <b>Options</b>.

       <b>--no-hot-list</b>
              Tells <b>dialog</b> to suppress the hotkey feature for lists, e.g., the checkbox, menus.

              Normally,  the  first  uppercase  character  of  a list entry will be highlighted, and typing that
              character will move the focus to that entry.  This option suppresses both the highlighting and the
              movement.

              Hotkeys for buttons (“OK” , “Cancel”, etc.) are unaffected.

       <b>--no-items</b>
              Some widgets (checklist, inputmenu, radiolist, menu) display a list with two columns (a “tag”  and
              “item”,  i.e., “description”).  This option tells <b>dialog</b> to read shorter rows, omitting the “item”
              part of the list.  This is occasionally useful, e.g., if the tags provide enough information.

              See also <b>--no-tags</b>.  If both options are given, this one is ignored.

       <b>--no-kill</b>
              Tells <b>dialog</b> to put the <b>tailboxbg</b> box in the background,  printing  its  process  id  to  <b>dialog</b>'s
              output.  SIGHUP is disabled for the background process.

       <b>--no-label</b> <u>string</u>
              Override the label used for “No” buttons.

       <b>--no-lines</b>
              Rather than draw lines around boxes, draw spaces in the same place.  See also “<b>--ascii-lines</b>”.

       <b>--no-mouse</b>
              Do not enable the mouse.

       <b>--no-nl-expand</b>
              Do not convert “\n” substrings of the message/prompt text into literal newlines.

              The  <u>no-nl-expand</u>  feature  is used only if the string contains “\n” so that there is something to
              convert.

              For more information, see <b>Whitespace</b> <b>Options</b>.

       <b>--no-ok</b>
              Suppress the “OK” button, so that it is not displayed.  A  script  can  still  test  if  the  user
              pressed the “Enter” key to accept the data:

              •   The  “Enter”  key  is always handled as the “OK” button when the <b>--no-ok</b> option is used.  That
                  is, by default it is bound to the <u>LEAVE</u> virtual key.

                  When <b>--no-ok</b> is not used, you can use the the <u>Tab</u> key to move the cursor  through  the  fields
                  and  buttons on the widget.  In that case, the “Enter” key activates the current button if the
                  cursor is positioned on a button.

              •   To provide for the case where you want to activate a  button  when  using  <b>--no-ok</b>,  there  is
                  another  virtual key <u>LEAVE</u>, which activates the current button.  By default, <b>^D</b> (EOF) is bound
                  to that key.

       <b>--no-shadow</b>
              Suppress shadows that would be drawn to the right and bottom of each dialog box.

       <b>--no-tags</b>
              Some widgets (checklist, inputmenu, radiolist, menu) display a list with two columns (a “tag”  and
              “description”).  The tag is useful for scripting, but may not help the user.  The <b>--no-tags</b> option
              (from Xdialog) may be used to suppress the column of tags from the display.  Unlike the <b>--no-items</b>
              option, this does not affect the data which is read from the script.

              Xdialog  does  not display the tag column for the analogous buildlist and treeview widgets; <b>dialog</b>
              does the same.

              Normally <b>dialog</b> allows you to quickly move to entries on the displayed list, by matching a  single
              character  to  the first character of the tag.  When the <b>--no-tags</b> option is given, <b>dialog</b> matches
              against the first character of the description.   In  either  case,  the  matchable  character  is
              highlighted.

       <b>--ok-label</b> <u>string</u>
              Override the label used for “OK” buttons.

       <b>--output-fd</b> <u>fd</u>
              Direct  output to the given file descriptor.  Most <b>dialog</b> scripts write to the standard error, but
              error messages may also be written there, depending on your script.

       <b>--separator</b> <u>string</u>

       <b>--output-separator</b> <u>string</u>
              Specify a string that will separate the output on <b>dialog</b>'s output from checklists, rather  than  a
              newline  (for  <b>--separate-output</b>)  or  a  space.   This applies to other widgets such as forms and
              editboxes which normally use a newline.

       <b>--print-maxsize</b>
              Print the maximum size of dialog boxes, i.e., the screen size, to <b>dialog</b>'s output.   This  may  be
              used alone, without other options.

       <b>--print-size</b>
              Prints the size of each dialog box to <b>dialog</b>'s output when the box is initialized.

       <b>--print-text-only</b> <u>string</u> <u>[</u> <u>height</u> <u>[</u> <u>width</u> <u>]</u> <u>]</u>
              Prints the string as it would be wrapped in a message box to <b>dialog</b>'s output.

              Because  the  optional  <u>height</u>  and  <u>width</u>  default to zero, if they are omitted, <b>dialog</b> autosizes
              according to the screen dimensions.

       <b>--print-text-size</b> <u>string</u> <u>[</u> <u>height</u> <u>[</u> <u>width</u> <u>]</u> <u>]</u>
              Prints the size of the string as it would be wrapped in a message box, to <b>dialog</b>'s output, as

              height width

              Because the optional <u>height</u> and <u>width</u> parameters default to zero,  if  they  are  omitted,  <b>dialog</b>
              autosizes according to the screen dimensions.

       <b>--print-version</b>
              Prints  <b>dialog</b>'s  version  to <b>dialog</b>'s output.  This may be used alone, without other options.  It
              does not cause <b>dialog</b> to exit by itself.

       <b>--quoted</b>
              Normally <b>dialog</b> quotes the strings returned by checklist's as well as  the  item-help  text.   Use
              this  option  to  quote all string results as needed (i.e., if the string contains whitespace or a
              single or double-quote character).

       <b>--reorder</b>
              By default, the buildlist widget uses the same order for the output (right) list as for the  input
              (left).   Use  this  option to tell <b>dialog</b> to use the order in which a user adds selections to the
              output list.

       <b>--scrollbar</b>
              For widgets holding a scrollable set of data, draw a scrollbar on its right-margin.  This does not
              respond to the mouse.

       <b>--separate-output</b>
              For certain widgets (buildlist, checklist, treeview), output result one line at a  time,  with  no
              quoting.  This facilitates parsing by another program.

       <b>--separate-widget</b> <u>string</u>
              Specify  a string that will separate the output on <b>dialog</b>'s output from each widget.  This is used
              to simplify parsing the result of a dialog with several widgets.  If this option is not given, the
              default separator string is a tab character.

       <b>--single-quoted</b>
              Use single-quoting as needed (and no quotes if unneeded) for the output of checklist's as well  as
              the item-help text.

              If  this option is not set, <b>dialog</b> may use double quotes around each item.  In either case, <b>dialog</b>
              adds backslashes to make the output useful in shell scripts.

              Single quotes would be needed if the string  contains  whitespace  or  a  single  or  double-quote
              character.

       <b>--size-err</b>
              Check  the  resulting size of a dialog box before trying to use it, printing the resulting size if
              it is larger than the screen.  (This option is obsolete, since all new-window calls are checked).

       <b>--sleep</b> <u>secs</u>
              Sleep (delay) for the given number of seconds after processing a dialog box.

       <b>--stderr</b>
              Direct output to the standard error.  This is the default, since  curses  normally  writes  screen
              updates to the standard output.

       <b>--stdout</b>
              Direct  output  to  the  standard output.  This option is provided for compatibility with Xdialog,
              however using it in portable scripts is not recommended, since curses normally writes  its  screen
              updates to the standard output.  If you use this option, <b>dialog</b> attempts to reopen the terminal so
              it can write to the display.  Depending on the platform and your environment, that may fail.

       <b>--tab-correct</b>
              Convert  each  tab  character to one or more spaces (for the <b>textbox</b> widget; otherwise to a single
              space).  Otherwise, tabs are rendered according  to  the  curses  library's  interpretation.   The
              <b>--no-collapse</b> option disables tab expansion.

       <b>--tab-len</b> <u>n</u>
              Specify the number of spaces that a tab character occupies if the “<b>--tab-correct</b>” option is given.
              The default is 8.  This option is only effective for the <b>textbox</b> widget.

       <b>--time-format</b> <u>format</u>
              If  the  host  provides <b>strftime</b>, this option allows you to specify the format of the time printed
              for the <b>--timebox</b> widget.  The day, month, year values in this case  are  for  the  current  local
              time.

       <b>--timeout</b> <u>secs</u>
              Timeout  if  no  user  response  within the given number of seconds.  A timeout of zero seconds is
              ignored.

              Normally a timeout causes an ESC character to be entered in the  current  widget,  cancelling  it.
              Other  widgets  may  still  be  on  the  screen;  these are not cancelled.  Set the <b>DIALOG_TIMEOUT</b>
              environment variable to tell <b>dialog</b> to directly exit instead, i.e., cancelling all widgets on  the
              screen.

              This  option  is  ignored  by  the  “<b>--pause</b>”  widget.   It  is  also overridden if the background
              “<b>--tailboxbg</b>” option is used to set up multiple concurrent widgets.

       <b>--title</b> <u>title</u>
              Specifies a <u>title</u> string to be displayed at the top of the dialog box.

       <b>--trace</b> <u>filename</u>
              logs the command-line parameters, keystrokes and other information to the given file.   If  <b>dialog</b>
              reads  a  configure  file,  it is logged as well.  Piped input to the <u>gauge</u> widget is logged.  Use
              control/T to log a picture of the current dialog window.

              The <b>dialog</b> program handles some command-line parameters  specially,  and  removes  them  from  the
              parameter  list  as they are processed.  For example, if the first option is <b>--trace</b>, then that is
              processed (and removed) before <b>dialog</b> initializes the display.

       <b>--week-start</b> <u>day</u>
              sets the starting day for the week, used in the “<b>--calendar</b>” option.  The <u>day</u> parameter can be

              •   a number (0 to 6, Sunday through Saturday using POSIX) or

              •   the special value “locale” (this works with systems using glibc, providing an extension to the
                  <b>locale</b> command, the <b>first_weekday</b> value).

              •   a string matching one of the abbreviations for the day of  the  week  shown  in  the  <b>calendar</b>
                  widget, e.g., “Mo” for “Monday”.

       <b>--trim</b> eliminate leading blanks, trim literal newlines and repeated blanks from message text.

              The <u>trim</u> feature is implemented subject to these conditions:

              •   the string does not contain “\n” or

              •   the <b>--no-nl-expand</b> option is used.

              For more information, see <b>Whitespace</b> <b>Options</b>.

              See also the “<b>--cr-wrap</b>” and “<b>--no-collapse</b>” options.

       <b>--version</b>
              Prints <b>dialog</b>'s version to the standard output, and exits.  See also “<b>--print-version</b>”.

       <b>--visit-items</b>
              Modify  the  tab-traversal  of  checklist, radiolist, menubox and inputmenu to include the list of
              items as one of the states.  This is useful as a visual aid, i.e., the cursor position helps  some
              users.

              When  this  option is given, the cursor is initially placed on the list.  Abbreviations (the first
              letter of the tag) apply to the list items.  If you tab to the button row, abbreviations apply  to
              the buttons.

       <b>--yes-label</b> <u>string</u>
              Override the label used for “Yes” buttons.

   <b>Box</b> <b>Options</b>
       All dialog boxes have at least three parameters:

       <u>text</u>   the caption or contents of the box.

       <u>height</u> the height of the dialog box.

       <u>width</u>  the width of the dialog box.

       Other parameters depend on the box type.

       <b>--buildlist</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u> <u>list-height</u> [ <u>tag</u> <u>item</u> <u>status</u> ] <u>...</u>
              A <b>buildlist</b> dialog displays two lists, side-by-side.  The list on the left shows unselected items.
              The  list  on  the  right  shows  selected  items.  As items are selected or unselected, they move
              between the lists.

              Use a carriage return or the “OK” button to accept the current value in  the  selected-window  and
              exit.  The results are written using the order displayed in the selected-window.

              The initial on/off state of each entry is specified by <u>status</u>.

              The  dialog  behaves like a <b>menu</b>, using the <b>--visit-items</b> to control whether the cursor is allowed
              to visit the lists directly.

              •   If <b>--visit-items</b> is not given, tab-traversal uses two states (OK/Cancel).

              •   If <b>--visit-items</b> is given, tab-traversal uses four states (Left/Right/OK/Cancel).

              Whether or not <b>--visit-items</b> is given, it is possible to move the highlight between the two  lists
              using the default “^” (left-column) and “$” (right-column) keys.

              On exit, a list of the <u>tag</u> strings of those entries that are turned on will be printed on <b>dialog</b>'s
              output.

              If  the  "<b>--separate-output</b>"  option is not given, the strings will be quoted as needed to make it
              simple for scripts to separate them.  By default, this uses double-quotes,  as  needed.   See  the
              “<b>--single-quoted</b>” option, which modifies the quoting behavior.

       <b>--calendar</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u> <u>day</u> <u>month</u> <u>year</u>
              A  <b>calendar</b>  box displays month, day and year in separately adjustable windows.  If the values for
              day, month or year are missing or negative, the current date's corresponding values are used.  You
              can increment or decrement any of those using the left-, up-, right-, and  down-arrows.   Use  vi-
              style  h,  j,  k and l for moving around the array of days in a month.  Use tab or backtab to move
              between windows.  If the year is given as zero, the current date is used as an initial value.

              On exit, the date is printed in the form day/month/year.  The format can be overridden  using  the
              <b>--date-format</b> option.

       <b>--checklist</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u> <u>list-height</u> [ <u>tag</u> <u>item</u> <u>status</u> ] <u>...</u>
              A  <b>checklist</b>  box  is similar to a <b>menu</b> box; there are multiple entries presented in the form of a
              menu.  Another difference is that you can indicate which entry is currently selected,  by  setting
              its <u>status</u> to <u>on</u>.  Instead of choosing one entry among the entries, each entry can be turned on or
              off by the user.  The initial on/off state of each entry is specified by <u>status</u>.

              On exit, a list of the <u>tag</u> strings of those entries that are turned on will be printed on <b>dialog</b>'s
              output.

              If  the  “<b>--separate-output</b>”  option is not given, the strings will be quoted as needed to make it
              simple for scripts to separate them.  By default, this uses double-quotes (as  needed).   See  the
              “<b>--single-quoted</b>” option, which modifies the quoting behavior.

       <b>--dselect</b> <u>filepath</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u>
              The directory-selection dialog displays a text-entry window in which you can type a directory, and
              above that a windows with directory names.

              Here  <b>filepath</b>  can  be a filepath in which case the directory window will display the contents of
              the path and the text-entry window will contain the preselected directory.

              Use tab or arrow keys to move between the windows.  Within the directory window, use  the  up/down
              arrow  keys to scroll the current selection.  Use the space-bar to copy the current selection into
              the text-entry window.

              Typing any printable characters switches focus to the text-entry window, entering  that  character
              as well as scrolling the directory window to the closest match.

              Use  a carriage return or the “OK” button to accept the current value in the text-entry window and
              exit.

              On exit, the contents of the text-entry window are written to <b>dialog</b>'s output.

       <b>--editbox</b> <u>filepath</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u>
              The edit-box dialog displays a copy of the file.  You may edit it using the <u>backspace</u>, <u>delete</u>  and
              cursor keys to correct typing errors.  It also recognizes pageup/pagedown.  Unlike the <b>--inputbox</b>,
              you must tab to the “OK” or “Cancel” buttons to close the dialog.  Pressing the “Enter” key within
              the box will split the corresponding line.

              On exit, the contents of the edit window are written to <b>dialog</b>'s output.

       <b>--form</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u> <u>formheight</u> [ <u>label</u> <u>y</u> <u>x</u> <u>item</u> <u>y</u> <u>x</u> <u>flen</u> <u>ilen</u> ] <u>...</u>
              The  <b>form</b>  dialog  displays  a  form  consisting  of  labels and fields, which are positioned on a
              scrollable window by coordinates given in the script.  The field length <u>flen</u> and input-length <u>ilen</u>
              tell how long the field can be.  The former defines the length shown for a selected  field,  while
              the latter defines the permissible length of the data entered in the field.

              •   If  <u>flen</u>  is  zero,  the corresponding field cannot be altered.  and the contents of the field
                  determine the displayed-length.

              •   If <u>flen</u> is negative, the corresponding field cannot be altered, and the negated value of  <u>flen</u>
                  is used as the displayed-length.

              •   If <u>ilen</u> is zero, it is set to <u>flen</u>.

              Use  up/down  arrows  (or  control/N,  control/P) to move between fields.  Use tab to move between
              windows.

              On exit, the contents of the form-fields are written to <b>dialog</b>'s output, each field separated by a
              newline.  The text used to fill non-editable fields (<u>flen</u> is zero or negative) is not written out.

       <b>--fselect</b> <u>filepath</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u>
              The <b>fselect</b> (file-selection) dialog displays a text-entry window in which you can type a  filename
              (or directory), and above that two windows with directory names and filenames.

              Here  <b>filepath</b>  can  be  a  filepath in which case the file and directory windows will display the
              contents of the path and the text-entry window will contain the preselected filename.

              Use tab or arrow keys to move between the windows.  Within the directory or filename windows,  use
              the  up/down  arrow  keys  to scroll the current selection.  Use the space-bar to copy the current
              selection into the text-entry window.

              Typing any printable characters switches focus to the text-entry window, entering  that  character
              as well as scrolling the directory and filename windows to the closest match.

              Typing the space character forces <b>dialog</b> to complete the current name (up to the point where there
              may be a match against more than one entry).

              Use  a carriage return or the “OK” button to accept the current value in the text-entry window and
              exit.

              On exit, the contents of the text-entry window are written to <b>dialog</b>'s output.

       <b>--gauge</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u> <u>[percent]</u>
              A <b>gauge</b> box displays a meter along the bottom of the box.  The  meter  indicates  the  percentage.
              New  percentages  are  read  from  standard  input, one integer per line.  The meter is updated to
              reflect each new percentage.  If the standard input reads the string “XXX”, then  the  first  line
              following  is  taken  as an integer percentage, then subsequent lines up to another “XXX” are used
              for a new prompt.  The gauge exits when EOF is reached on the standard input.

              The <u>percent</u> value denotes the initial percentage shown in the meter.   If  not  specified,  it  is
              zero.

              On  exit,  no text is written to <b>dialog</b>'s output.  The widget accepts no input, so the exit status
              is always OK.

       <b>--infobox</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u>
              An <b>info</b> box is basically a <b>message</b> box.  However, in this case, <b>dialog</b> will exit immediately after
              displaying the message to the user.  The screen is not cleared when  <b>dialog</b>  exits,  so  that  the
              message  will remain on the screen until the calling shell script clears it later.  This is useful
              when you want to inform the user that some operations are carrying on that may require  some  time
              to finish.

              On exit, no text is written to <b>dialog</b>'s output.  An OK exit status is returned.

       <b>--inputbox</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u> <u>[init]</u>
              An  <b>input</b>  box is useful when you want to ask questions that require the user to input a string as
              the answer.  If init is supplied it is used to initialize the input  string.   When  entering  the
              string,  the <u>backspace</u>, <u>delete</u> and cursor keys can be used to correct typing errors.  If the input
              string is longer than can fit in the dialog box, the input field will be scrolled.

              On exit, the input string will be printed on <b>dialog</b>'s output.

       <b>--inputmenu</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u> <u>menu-height</u> [ <u>tag</u> <u>item</u> ] <u>...</u>
              An <b>inputmenu</b> box is very similar to an ordinary <b>menu</b>  box.   There  are  only  a  few  differences
              between them:

              1.  The entries are not automatically centered but left adjusted.

              2.  An extra button (called <u>Rename</u>) is implied to rename the current item when it is pressed.

              3.  It  is  possible  to rename the current entry by pressing the <u>Rename</u> button.  Then <b>dialog</b> will
                  write the following on <b>dialog</b>'s output.

                  RENAMED &lt;tag&gt; &lt;item&gt;

       <b>--menu</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u> <u>menu-height</u> [ <u>tag</u> <u>item</u> ] <u>...</u>
              As its name suggests, a <b>menu</b> box is a dialog box that can be used to present a list of choices  in
              the  form  of a menu for the user to choose.  Choices are displayed in the order given.  Each menu
              entry consists of a <u>tag</u> string and an <u>item</u> string.  The <u>tag</u> gives the entry a name to  distinguish
              it  from  the  other  entries in the menu.  The <u>item</u> is a short description of the option that the
              entry represents.  The user can move between the menu entries by pressing  the  cursor  keys,  the
              first  letter  of  the  <u>tag</u>  as  a hot-key, or the number keys <u>1</u> through <u>9</u>.  There are <u>menu-height</u>
              entries displayed in the menu at one time, but the menu will be scrolled if there are more entries
              than that.

              On exit the  <u>tag</u>  of  the  chosen  menu  entry  will  be  printed  on  <b>dialog</b>'s  output.   If  the
              “<b>--help-button</b>”  option  is given, the corresponding help text will be printed if the user selects
              the help button.

       <b>--mixedform</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u> <u>formheight</u> [ <u>label</u> <u>y</u> <u>x</u> <u>item</u> <u>y</u> <u>x</u> <u>flen</u> <u>ilen</u> <u>itype</u> ] <u>...</u>
              The <b>mixedform</b> dialog displays a form consisting of labels and fields, much like the <b>--form</b> dialog.
              It differs by adding a field-type parameter to each field's description.  Each  bit  in  the  type
              denotes an attribute of the field:

              1    hidden, e.g., a password field.

              2    readonly, e.g., a label.

       <b>--mixedgauge</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u> <u>percent</u> [ <u>tag1</u> <u>item1</u> ] <u>...</u>
              A  <b>mixedgauge</b>  box  displays  a  meter  along  the  bottom  of  the  box.  The meter indicates the
              percentage.

              It also displays a list of the <u>tag</u>- and <u>item</u>-values at the top of the box.  See <a href="../man3/dialog.3.html">dialog</a>(3) for  the
              tag values.

              The  <u>text</u> is shown as a caption between the list and meter.  The <u>percent</u> value denotes the initial
              percentage shown in the meter.

              No provision is made for reading data from the standard input as <b>--gauge</b> does.

              On exit, no text is written to <b>dialog</b>'s output.  The widget accepts no input, so the  exit  status
              is always OK.

       <b>--msgbox</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u>
              A  <b>message</b>  box  is very similar to a <b>yes/no</b> box.  The only difference between a <b>message</b> box and a
              <b>yes/no</b> box is that a <b>message</b> box has only a single <b>OK</b> button.  You can  use  this  dialog  box  to
              display any message you like.  After reading the message, the user can press the <u>ENTER</u> key so that
              <b>dialog</b> will exit and the calling shell script can continue its operation.

              If  the  message  is too large for the space, <b>dialog</b> may allow you to scroll it, provided that the
              underlying curses implementation is capable enough.  In this case, a percentage is  shown  in  the
              base of the widget.

              On exit, no text is written to <b>dialog</b>'s output.  Only an “OK” button is provided for input, but an
              ESC exit status may be returned.

       <b>--pause</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u> <u>seconds</u>
              A  <b>pause</b>  box  displays a meter along the bottom of the box.  The meter indicates how many seconds
              remain until the end of the pause.  The pause exits when timeout is reached or  the  user  presses
              the OK button (status OK) or the user presses the CANCEL button or Esc key.

       <b>--passwordbox</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u> <u>[init]</u>
              A  <b>password</b> box is similar to an input box, except that the text the user enters is not displayed.
              This is useful when prompting for passwords or other sensitive  information.   Be  aware  that  if
              anything is passed in “init”, it will be visible in the system's process table to casual snoopers.
              Also,  it  is  very confusing to the user to provide them with a default password they cannot see.
              For these reasons, using “init” is highly discouraged.  See “<b>--insecure</b>” if you do not care  about
              your password.

              On exit, the input string will be printed on <b>dialog</b>'s output.

       <b>--passwordform</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u> <u>formheight</u> [ <u>label</u> <u>y</u> <u>x</u> <u>item</u> <u>y</u> <u>x</u> <u>flen</u> <u>ilen</u> ] <u>...</u>
              This  is  identical  to  <b>--form</b> except that all text fields are treated as <b>password</b> widgets rather
              than <b>inputbox</b> widgets.

       <b>--prgbox</b> <u>text</u> <u>command</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u>

       <b>--prgbox</b> <u>command</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u>
              A <b>prgbox</b> is very similar to a <b>programbox</b>.

              This dialog box is used to display the output of a command that is specified  as  an  argument  to
              <b>prgbox</b>.

              After  the  command  completes,  the user can press the <u>ENTER</u> key so that <b>dialog</b> will exit and the
              calling shell script can continue its operation.

              If four parameters are given, it displays the text under the title, delineated from the  scrolling
              file's contents.  If only three parameters are given, this text is omitted.

       <b>--programbox</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u>

       <b>--programbox</b> <u>height</u> <u>width</u>
              A  <b>programbox</b>  is  very similar to a <b>progressbox</b>.  The only difference between a <b>program</b> box and a
              <b>progress</b> box is that a <b>program</b> box displays an <b>OK</b> button (but only after the command completes).

              This dialog box is used to display the piped output of a command.  After  the  command  completes,
              the  user  can  press  the  <u>ENTER</u>  key  so  that <b>dialog</b> will exit and the calling shell script can
              continue its operation.

              If three parameters are given, it displays the text under the title, delineated from the scrolling
              file's contents.  If only two parameters are given, this text is omitted.

       <b>--progressbox</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u>

       <b>--progressbox</b> <u>height</u> <u>width</u>
              A <b>progressbox</b> is similar to an <b>tailbox</b>, except that

              a) rather than displaying the contents of a file,
                 it displays the piped output of a command and

              b) it will exit when it reaches the end of the file
                 (there is no “OK” button).

              If three parameters are given, it displays the text under the title, delineated from the scrolling
              file's contents.  If only two parameters are given, this text is omitted.

       <b>--radiolist</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u> <u>list-height</u>  [ <u>tag</u> <u>item</u> <u>status</u> ] <u>...</u>
              A <b>radiolist</b> box is similar to a <b>menu</b> box.  The only difference is  that  you  can  indicate  which
              entry is currently selected, by setting its <u>status</u> to <u>on</u>.

              On exit, the tag of the selected item is written to <b>dialog</b>'s output.

       <b>--rangebox</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u> <u>min-value</u> <u>max-value</u> <u>default-value</u>
              Allow  the  user  to  select  from  a range of values, e.g., using a slider.  The dialog shows the
              current value as a bar (like the gauge dialog).  Tabs or arrow keys move the  cursor  between  the
              buttons and the value.  When the cursor is on the value, you can edit it by:

              left/right cursor movement to select a digit to modify

              +/-  characters to increment/decrement the digit by one

              0 through 9
                   to set the digit to the given value

              Some keys are also recognized in all cursor positions:

              home/end
                   set the value to its maximum or minimum

              pageup/pagedown
                   increment the value so that the slider moves by one column

       <b>--tailbox</b> <u>file</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u>
              Display  text from a file in a dialog box, as in a “tail -f” command.  Scroll left/right using vi-
              style 'h' and 'l', or arrow-keys.  A '0' resets the scrolling.

              On exit, no text is written to <b>dialog</b>'s output.  Only an “OK” button is provided for input, but an
              ESC exit status may be returned.

       <b>--tailboxbg</b> <u>file</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u>
              Display text from a file in a dialog box as a background task,  as  in  a  “tail  -f  &amp;”  command.
              Scroll left/right using vi-style 'h' and 'l', or arrow-keys.  A '0' resets the scrolling.

              Dialog  treats  the  background  task  specially  if there are other widgets (<b>--and-widget</b>) on the
              screen concurrently.  Until those widgets are closed (e.g., an “OK”), <b>dialog</b> will perform  all  of
              the  tailboxbg  widgets  in  the same process, polling for updates.  You may use a tab to traverse
              between the widgets on the screen, and close them individually, e.g., by pressing <u>ENTER</u>.  Once the
              non-tailboxbg widgets are closed, <b>dialog</b> forks a copy of itself into the  background,  and  prints
              its process id if the “<b>--no-kill</b>” option is given.

              On  exit, no text is written to <b>dialog</b>'s output.  Only an “EXIT” button is provided for input, but
              an ESC exit status may be returned.

              NOTE: Older versions of <b>dialog</b> forked immediately and attempted to update the screen individually.
              Besides being bad for performance, it was unworkable.  Some older scripts may  not  work  properly
              with the polled scheme.

       <b>--textbox</b> <u>file</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u>
              A <b>text</b> box lets you display the contents of a text file in a dialog box.  It is like a simple text
              file  viewer.   The  user  can  move  through the file by using the cursor, page-up, page-down and
              <u>HOME/END</u> keys available on most keyboards.  If the lines are too long to be displayed in the  box,
              the <u>LEFT/RIGHT</u> keys can be used to scroll the text region horizontally.  You may also use vi-style
              keys  h, j, k, and l in place of the cursor keys, and B or N in place of the page-up and page-down
              keys.  Scroll up/down using vi-style 'k' and 'j', or arrow-keys.  Scroll left/right using vi-style
              'h' and 'l', or arrow-keys.  A '0' resets the left/right scrolling.   For  more  convenience,  vi-
              style forward and backward searching functions are also provided.

              On  exit, no text is written to <b>dialog</b>'s output.  Only an “EXIT” button is provided for input, but
              an ESC exit status may be returned.

       <b>--timebox</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>[width</u> <u>hour</u> <u>minute</u> <u>second]</u>
              A dialog is displayed which allows you to select hour, minute and second.  If the values for hour,
              minute or second are missing or negative, the current date's corresponding values are  used.   You
              can  increment or decrement any of those using the left-, up-, right- and down-arrows.  Use tab or
              backtab to move between windows.

              On exit, the result is printed in the form hour:minute:second.  The format can be overridden using
              the <b>--time-format</b> option.

       <b>--treeview</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u> <u>list-height</u> [ <u>tag</u> <u>item</u> <u>status</u> <u>depth</u> ] <u>...</u>
              Display data organized as a tree.  Each group of data contains a tag, the text to display for  the
              item, its status (“on” or “off”) and the depth of the item in the tree.

              Only one item can be selected (like the <b>radiolist</b>).  The tag is not displayed.

              On exit, the tag of the selected item is written to <b>dialog</b>'s output.

       <b>--yesno</b> <u>text</u> <u>height</u> <u>width</u>
              A  <b>yes/no</b> dialog box of size <u>height</u> rows by <u>width</u> columns will be displayed.  The string specified
              by <u>text</u> is displayed inside the dialog box.  If this string is too long to fit  in  one  line,  it
              will be automatically divided into multiple lines at appropriate places.  The <u>text</u> string can also
              contain  the sub-string "<u>\n</u>" or newline characters `<u>\n</u>' to control line breaking explicitly.  This
              dialog box is useful for asking questions that require the user to answer either yes or  no.   The
              dialog  box has a <b>Yes</b> button and a <b>No</b> button, in which the user can switch between by pressing the
              <u>TAB</u> key.

              On exit, no text is written to <b>dialog</b>'s output.  In addition to the “Yes” and “No” exit codes (see
              DIAGNOSTICS) an ESC exit status may be returned.

              The codes used for “Yes”  and  “No”  match  those  used  for  “OK”  and  “Cancel”,  internally  no
              distinction is made.

   <b>Obsolete</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--beep</b> This  was used to tell the original cdialog that it should make a beep when the separate processes
              of the tailboxbg widget would repaint the screen.

       <b>--beep-after</b>
              Beep after a user has completed a widget by pressing one of the buttons.

   <b>Whitespace</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options can be used to transform whitespace (space, tab, newline) as dialog reads the script:
              <b>--cr-wrap</b>, <b>--no-collapse</b>, <b>--no-nl-expand</b>, and <b>--trim</b>

       The options are not independent:

       •   <b>Dialog</b> checks if the script contains at least one “\n” and (unless <b>--no-nl-expand</b> is set) will ignore
           the <b>--no-collapse</b> and <b>--trim</b> options.

       •   After checking for “\n” and the <b>--no-nl-expand</b> option, <b>dialog</b> handles the <b>--trim</b> option.

           If the <b>--trim</b> option takes effect, then <b>dialog</b> ignores <b>--no-collapse</b>.  It changes sequences of  tabs,
           spaces (and newlines unless <b>-cr-wrap</b> is set) to a single space.

       •   If  neither  the  “\n” or <b>--trim</b> cases apply, <b>dialog</b> checks <b>--no-collapse</b> to decide whether to reduce
           sequences of tabs and spaces to a single space.

           In this case, <b>dialog</b> ignores <b>--cr-wrap</b> and does not modify newlines.

       Taking those dependencies into account, here  is  a  table  summarizing  the  behavior  for  the  various
       combinations  of  options.   The  table  assumes  that  the  script  contains  at least one “\n” when the
       <b>--no-nl-expand</b> option is not set.
            <b>cr-</b>    <b>no-</b>        <b>no-</b>         <b>trim</b>   <b>Result</b>

</pre><h4><b>RUN-TIME</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       1.  Create a sample configuration file by typing:

              dialog --create-rc <u>file</u>

       2.  At start, <b>dialog</b> determines the settings to use as follows:

           a)  if environment variable <b>DIALOGRC</b> is set, its value determines the name of the configuration file.

           b)  if the file in (a) is not found, use the file <u>$HOME/.dialogrc</u> as the configuration file.

           c)  if the file in (b) is not found, try using the GLOBALRC file determined  at  compile-time,  i.e.,
               <u>/etc/dialogrc</u>.

           d)  if the file in (c) is not found, use compiled in defaults.

       3.  Edit  the sample configuration file and copy it to some place that <b>dialog</b> can find, as stated in step
           2 above.

</pre><h4><b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       You can override or add to key bindings in <b>dialog</b> by adding to the configuration file.  <b>Dialog</b>'s  <b>bindkey</b>
       command maps single keys to its internal coding.

              bindkey <u>widget</u> <u>curses_key</u> <u>dialog_key</u>

       The  <u>widget</u> name can be “*” (all widgets), or specific widgets such as <b>textbox</b>.  Specific widget bindings
       override the “*” bindings.  User-defined bindings override the built-in bindings.

       The <u>curses_key</u> can be expressed in different forms:

       •   It may be any of the names derived from <b>curses.h</b>, e.g., “HELP” from “KEY_HELP”.

       •   <b>Dialog</b> also recognizes ANSI control characters such as “^A”, “^?”, as well  as  C1-controls  such  as
           “~A” and “~?”.

       •   Finally, <b>dialog</b> allows backslash escapes as in C.  Those can be octal character values such as “\033”
           (the ASCII escape character), or the characters listed in this table:
                 <u>Escaped</u>   <u>Actual</u>
                 ───────────────────────────────
                 \b        backspace
                 \f        form feed
                 \n        new line (line feed)
                 \r        carriage return
                 \s        space
                 \t        tab
                 \^        “^” (caret)
                 \?        “?” (question mark)
                 \\        “\” (backslash)
                 ───────────────────────────────

       <b>Dialog</b>'s  internal  keycode  names  correspond to the <b>DLG_KEYS_ENUM</b> type in <b>dlg_keys.h</b>, e.g., “HELP” from
       “DLGK_HELP”.

   <b>Widget</b> <b>Names</b>
       Some widgets (such as the formbox) have an area where fields can be  edited.   Those  are  managed  in  a
       subwindow  of  the  widget, and may have separate keybindings from the main widget because the subwindows
       are registered using a different name.
            <u>Widget</u>        <u>Window</u> <u>name</u>   <u>Subwindow</u> <u>Name</u>
            ───────────────────────────────────────────

       Some widgets are actually other widgets, using internal settings to modify the behavior.  Those  use  the
       same widget name as the actual widget:
            <u>Widget</u>         <u>Actual</u> <u>Widget</u>
            ─────────────────────────────
            dselect        fselect

            programbox     progressbox
            tailboxbg      tailbox
            ─────────────────────────────

   <b>Built-in</b> <b>Bindings</b>
       This manual page does not list the key bindings for each widget, because that detailed information can be
       obtained  by  running  <b>dialog</b>.   If  you  have  set  the  <b>--trace</b>  option,  <b>dialog</b> writes the key-binding
       information for each widget as it is registered.

       A few bindings are built-in, independent of particular widgets:
       <u>Key</u>               <u>Purpose</u>
       ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       Control-I         forward tab-traversal, e.g., with <b>--tailboxbg</b>.
       Control-L         repaints the screen.
       Control-T         writes a screen dump to the <b>--trace</b> file.
       Control-V         suppresses special-keys for the next input byte.
       DLGK_FIELD_NEXT   forward tab-traversal, like Control-I.
       DLGK_FIELD_PREV   backward tab-traversal, like back-tab.
       DLGK_HELPFILE     displays the help-file specified with <b>--hfile</b>.
       KEY_BTAB          backward tab-traversal, e.g., with <b>--tailboxbg</b>.
       ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

   <b>Example</b>
       Normally <b>dialog</b> uses different keys for navigating between the buttons  and  editing  part  of  a  dialog
       versus  navigating  within  the  editing  part.  That is, tab (and back-tab) traverse buttons (or between
       buttons and the editing part), while arrow keys traverse fields within the editing part.  Tabs  are  also
       recognized as a special case for traversing between widgets, e.g., when using multiple tailboxbg widgets.

       Some  users may wish to use the same key for traversing within the editing part as for traversing between
       buttons.  The form widget is written to support this sort of  redefinition  of  the  keys,  by  adding  a
       special group in <b>dlgk_keys.h</b> for “form” (left/right/next/prev).  Here is an example binding demonstrating
       how to do this:

              bindkey formfield TAB  form_NEXT
              bindkey formbox   TAB  form_NEXT
              bindkey formfield BTAB form_prev
              bindkey formbox   BTAB form_prev

       That  type  of  redefinition would not be useful in other widgets, e.g., calendar, due to the potentially
       large number of fields to traverse.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       Exit  status  is  subject  to  being  overridden  by  environment  variables.   The  default  values  and
       corresponding environment variables that can override them are:

       0    if the <b>YES</b> or <b>OK</b> button is pressed (DIALOG_OK).

       1    if the <b>No</b> or <b>Cancel</b> button is pressed (DIALOG_CANCEL).

       2    if the <b>Help</b> button is pressed (DIALOG_HELP),
            except as noted below about DIALOG_ITEM_HELP.

       3    if the <b>Extra</b> button is pressed (DIALOG_EXTRA).

       4    if the <b>Help</b> button is pressed,
            and the <b>--item-help</b> option is set
            and the DIALOG_ITEM_HELP environment variable is set to 4.

            While  any  of  the  exit-codes can be overridden using environment variables, this special case was
            introduced in 2004 to simplify compatibility.  <b>Dialog</b>  uses  DIALOG_ITEM_HELP  (4)  internally,  but
            unless the environment variable is also set, it changes that to DIALOG_HELP (2) on exit.

       5    if a timeout expires and the <b>DIALOG_TIMEOUT</b> variable is set to 5.

       -1   if  errors  occur  inside <b>dialog</b> (DIALOG_ERROR) or <b>dialog</b> exits because the <u>ESC</u> key (DIALOG_ESC) was
            pressed.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DIALOGOPTS</b>     Define this variable to apply any of the common options  to  each  widget.   Most  of  the
                      common  options  are  reset before processing each widget.  If you set the options in this
                      environment variable, they are applied to <b>dialog</b>'s state  after  the  reset.   As  in  the
                      “<b>--file</b>” option, double-quotes and backslashes are interpreted.

                      The  “<b>--file</b>” option is not considered a common option (so you cannot embed it within this
                      environment variable).

       <b>DIALOGRC</b>       Define this variable if you want to specify the name of the configuration file to use.

       <b>DIALOG_CANCEL</b>

       <b>DIALOG_ERROR</b>

       <b>DIALOG_ESC</b>

       <b>DIALOG_EXTRA</b>

       <b>DIALOG_HELP</b>

       <b>DIALOG_ITEM_HELP</b>

       <b>DIALOG_TIMEOUT</b>

       <b>DIALOG_OK</b>      Define any of these variables to change the exit code on

                      •   Cancel (1),

                      •   error (-1),

                      •   ESC (255),

                      •   Extra (3),

                      •   Help (2),

                      •   Help with <b>--item-help</b> (2),

                      •   Timeout (5), or

                      •   OK (0).

                      Normally shell scripts cannot distinguish between -1 and 255.

       <b>DIALOG_TTY</b>     Set this variable to “1” to provide compatibility with  older  versions  of  <b>dialog</b>  which
                      assumed  that  if the script redirects the standard output, that the “<b>--stdout</b>” option was
                      given.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$HOME/.dialogrc</u>     default configuration file

</pre><h4><b>PORTABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Dialog</b> works with X/Open curses.  However, some implementations have deficiencies:

          •   HPUX curses (and perhaps others) do not open the terminal properly for the <u>newterm</u> function.  This
              interferes with <b>dialog</b>'s <b>--input-fd</b> option, by preventing cursor-keys and similar escape sequences
              from being recognized.

          •   NetBSD 5.1 curses has incomplete support for wide-characters.  <b>dialog</b>  will  build,  but  not  all
              examples display properly.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       You may want to write scripts which run with other <b>dialog</b> “clones”.

   <b>Original</b> <b>Dialog</b>
       First,  there is the “original” <b>dialog</b> program to consider (versions 0.3 to 0.9).  It had some misspelled
       (or inconsistent) options.  The <b>dialog</b> program maps those deprecated options to the preferred ones.  They
       include:
              <u>Option</u>         <u>Treatment</u>
              ─────────────────────────────────
              <b>--beep-after</b>   ignored
              <b>--guage</b>        mapped to <b>--gauge</b>
              ─────────────────────────────────

   <b>Xdialog</b>
       This is an X application, rather than a terminal program.  With some care, it is possible to write useful
       scripts that work with both <b>Xdialog</b> and <b>dialog</b>.

       The <b>dialog</b> program ignores these options which are recognized by <b>Xdialog</b>:
              <u>Option</u>             <u>Treatment</u>
              ───────────────────────────────────────────────
              <b>--allow-close</b>      ignored
              <b>--auto-placement</b>   ignored
              <b>--fixed-font</b>       ignored
              <b>--icon</b>             ignored
              <b>--keep-colors</b>      ignored
              <b>--no-close</b>         ignored
              <b>--no-cr-wrap</b>       ignored
              <b>--screen-center</b>    ignored
              <b>--separator</b>        mapped to <b>--separate-output</b>
              <b>--smooth</b>           ignored
              <b>--under-mouse</b>      ignored
              <b>--wmclass</b>          ignored
              ───────────────────────────────────────────────

       <b>Xdialog</b>'s manpage has a section discussing its compatibility with <b>dialog</b>.  There are some differences not
       shown in the manpage.  For example, the html documentation states

              Note: former Xdialog releases used the “\n” (line feed) as a results separator for  the  checklist
              widget;  this  has been changed to “/” in Xdialog v1.5.0 to make it compatible with (c)dialog.  In
              your old scripts using the Xdialog checklist, you will then  have  to  add  the  <b>--separate-output</b>
              option before the <b>--checklist</b> one.

       <b>Dialog</b>  has  not  used  a  different separator; the difference was likely due to confusion regarding some
       script.

   <b>Whiptail</b>
       Then there is <b>whiptail</b>.  For practical purposes, it is maintained by Debian (very little work is done  by
       its upstream developers).  Its documentation (README.whiptail) claims

              <b><a href="../man1/whiptail.1.html">whiptail</a></b>(1) is a lightweight replacement for <a href="../man1/dialog.1.html">dialog</a>(1),
              to provide dialog boxes for shell scripts.
              It is built on the
              newt windowing library rather than the ncurses library, allowing
              it to be smaller in embedded environments such as installers,
              rescue disks, etc.

              whiptail is designed to be drop-in compatible with dialog, but
              has less features: some dialog boxes are not implemented, such
              as tailbox, timebox, calendarbox, etc.

       Comparing  actual  sizes (Debian testing, 2007/1/10): The total of sizes for <b>whiptail</b>, the newt, popt and
       slang libraries is 757 KB.  The comparable number for <b>dialog</b> (counting ncurses) is 520 KB.  Disregard the
       first paragraph.

       The second paragraph is misleading, since <b>whiptail</b> also does not work for common options of <b>dialog</b>,  such
       as  the  gauge  box.   <b>whiptail</b>  is  less  compatible  with <b>dialog</b> than the original mid-1990s dialog 0.4
       program.

       <b>whiptail</b>'s manpage borrows features from <b>dialog</b>, e.g., but oddly cites only <b>dialog</b>  versions  up  to  0.4
       (1994)  as  a  source.   That  is,  its  manpage  refers to features which were borrowed from more recent
       versions of <b>dialog</b>, e.g.,

       •   <b>--gauge</b> (from 0.5)

       •   <b>--passwordbox</b> (from Debian changes in 1999),

       •   <b>--default-item</b> (from <b>dialog</b> 2000/02/22),

       •   <b>--output-fd</b> (from <b>dialog</b> 2002/08/14).

       Debian uses <b>whiptail</b> for the official <b>dialog</b> variation.

       The <b>dialog</b> program ignores or maps these options which are recognized by <b>whiptail</b>:
              <u>Option</u>            <u>Treatment</u>
              ───────────────────────────────────────────
              <b>--cancel-button</b>   mapped to <b>--cancel-label</b>
              <b>--fb</b>              ignored
              <b>--fullbutton</b>      ignored
              <b>--no-button</b>       mapped to <b>--no-label</b>
              <b>--nocancel</b>        mapped to <b>--no-cancel</b>
              <b>--noitem</b>          mapped to <b>--no-items</b>
              <b>--notags</b>          mapped to <b>--no-tags</b>
              <b>--ok-button</b>       mapped to <b>--ok-label</b>
              <b>--scrolltext</b>      mapped to <b>--scrollbar</b>
              <b>--topleft</b>         mapped to <b>--begin</b> <b>0</b> <b>0</b>
              <b>--yes-button</b>      mapped to <b>--yes-label</b>
              ───────────────────────────────────────────

       There are visual differences which are not addressed by command-line options:

       •   <b>dialog</b> centers lists within the window.  <b>whiptail</b> typically puts lists against the left margin.

       •   <b>whiptail</b> uses angle brackets (“&lt;” and “&gt;”) for marking buttons.  <b>dialog</b> uses square brackets.

       •   <b>whiptail</b> marks the limits of subtitles with vertical bars.  <b>dialog</b> does not mark the limits.

       •   <b>whiptail</b> attempts to mark the top/bottom cells of a scrollbar with up/down arrows.  When it cannot do
           this, it fills those cells with the background color of the scrollbar and confusing the user.  <b>dialog</b>
           uses the entire scrollbar space, thereby getting better resolution.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Perhaps.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>dialog</b> sources contain several samples of how to use the different box options  and  how  they  look.
       Just take a look into the directory <b>samples/</b> of the source.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       Thomas E. Dickey (updates for 0.9b and beyond)

       Kiran Cherupally – the mixed form and mixed gauge widgets.

       Tobias C. Rittweiler

       which lists as authors:

       •   Savio Lam – version 0.3, “dialog”

       •   Stuart Herbert – patch for version 0.4
