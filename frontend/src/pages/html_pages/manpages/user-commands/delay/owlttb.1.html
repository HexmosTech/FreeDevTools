</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       owlttb - one-way light time transmission delay simulator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>owlttb</b> <u>own_uplink_port#</u> <u>own_downlink_port#</u> <u>dest_uplink_IP_address</u> <u>dest_uplink_port#</u>
       <u>dest_downlink_IP_address</u> <u>dest_downlink_port#</u> <u>owlt_sec.</u> [-v]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>owlttb</b> delays delivery of data between an NTTI and a NetAcquire box (or two, one for uplink and one for
       downlink) by a specified length of time, simulating the signal propagation delay imposed by distance
       between the nodes.

       Its operation is configured by the command-line parameters, except that the delay interval itself may be
       changed while the program is running.  <b>owlttb</b> offers a command prompt (:), and when a new value of one-
       way light time is entered at this prompt the new delay interval takes effect immediately.

       <u>own_uplink_port#</u> identifies the port on <b>owlttb</b> accepts the NTTI's TCP connection for uplink traffic
       (i.e., data destined for the NetAcquire box).
       <u>own_downlink_port#</u> identifies the port on <b>owlttb</b> accepts the NTTI's TCP connection for downlink traffic
       (i.e., data issued by the NetAcquire box).
       <u>dest_uplink_IP_address</u> is the IP address (a dotted string) identifying the NetAcquire box to which <b>owlttb</b>
       will transmit uplink traffic.
       <u>dest_uplink_port#</u> identifies the TCP port to which <b>owlttb</b> will connect in order to transmit uplink
       traffic to NetAcquire.
       <u>dest_downlink_IP_address</u> is the IP address (a dotted string) identifying the NetAcquire box from which
       <b>owlttb</b> will receive downlink traffic.
       <u>dest_downlink_port#</u> identifies the TCP port to which <b>owlttb</b> will connect in order to receive downlink
       traffic from NetAcquire.
       <u>owlt</u> specifies the number of seconds to wait before forwarding each received segment of TCP traffic.

       The  optional  <b>-v</b>  ("verbose") parameter causes <b>owlttb</b> to print a message whenever it receives, sends, or
       discards (due to absence of a connected downlink client) a segment of TCP traffic.

       <b>owlttb</b> is designed to run indefinitely.  To terminate the program, just use control-C to kill it or enter
       "q" at the prompt.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       "0" Nominal termination.
       "1" Termination due to an error condition, as noted in printed messages.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here is a sample owlttb command:

       owlttb 2901 2902 137.7.8.19 10001 137.7.8.19 10002 75

       This command indicates that <b>owlttb</b> will accept an uplink traffic connection on port 2901, forwarding  the
       received  uplink traffic to port 10001 on the NetAcquire box at 137.7.8.19, and it will accept a downlink
       traffic connection on port 2902, delivering over that connection all downlink traffic  that  it  receives
       from  connecting  to  port  10002 on the NetAcquire box at 137.7.8.19.  75 seconds of delay (simulating a
       distance of 75 light seconds) will be imposed on this transmission activity.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Not applicable.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables apply.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The following diagnostics may be printed to stdout:

       owlttb can't spawn uplink thread
           The program terminates.

       owlttb can't spawn uplink sender thread
           The program terminates.

       owlttb can't spawn downlink thread
           The program terminates.

       owlttb can't spawn downlink receiver thread
           The program terminates.

       owlttb can't spawn downlink sender thread
           The program terminates.

       owlttb fgets failed
           The program terminates.

       owlttb out of memory.
           The program terminates.

       owlttb lost uplink client.
           This is an informational message.  The NTTI may reconnect at any time.

       owlttb lost downlink client
           This is an informational message.  The NTTI may reconnect at any time.

       owlttb can't open TCP socket to NetAcquire
           The program terminates.

       owlttb can't connect TCP socket to NetAcquire
           The program terminates.

       owlttb <u>write()</u> error on socket
           The program terminates if it was writing to NetAcquire;  otherwise  it  simply  recognizes  that  the
           client NTTI has disconnected.

       owlttb <u>read()</u> error on socket
           The program terminates.

       owlttb can't open uplink dialup socket
           The program terminates.

       owlttb can't initialize uplink dialup socket
           The program terminates.

       owlttb can't open downlink dialup socket
           The program terminates.

       owlttb can't initialize downlink dialup socket
           The program terminates.

       owlttb <u>accept()</u> failed
           The program terminates.
