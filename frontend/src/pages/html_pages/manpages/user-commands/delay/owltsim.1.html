</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       owltsim - one-way light time transmission delay simulator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>owltsim</b> <u>config_filename</u> [-v]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>owltsim</b> delays delivery of data between pairs of ION nodes by specified lengths of time, simulating the
       signal propagation delay imposed by distance between the nodes.

       Its operation is configured by delay simulation configuration lines in the file identified by
       <u>config_filename</u>.  A pair of threads is created for each line in the file: one that receives UDP datagrams
       on a specified port and queues them in a linked list, and a second that later removes queued datagrams
       from the linked list and sends them on to a specified UDP port on a specified network host.

       Each configuration line must be of the following form:

           <u>to</u> <u>from</u> <u>my_port#</u> <u>dest_host</u> <u>dest_port#</u> <u>owlt</u> <u>modulus</u>

       <u>to</u> identifies the receiving node.
           This  parameter  is purely informational, intended to make <b>owltsim</b>'s printed messages more helpful to
           the user.

       <u>from</u> identifies the sending node.
           A value of '*' may be used to indicate "all nodes".  Again, this parameter is  purely  informational,
           intended to make <b>owltsim</b>'s printed messages more helpful to the user.

       <u>my_port#</u> identifies <b>owltsim</b>'s receiving port for this traffic.
       <u>dest_host</u> is a hostname identifying the computer to which <b>owltsim</b> will transmit this traffic.
       <u>dest_port#</u> identifies the port to which <b>owltsim</b> will transmit this traffic.
       <u>owlt</u> specifies the number of seconds to wait before forwarding each received datagram.
       <u>modulus</u> controls the artificial random data loss imposed on this traffic by <b>owltsim</b>.
           A value of '0' specifies "no random data loss".  Any other modulus value N causes <b>owltsim</b> to randomly
           drop (i.e., not transmit upon expiration of the delay interval) one out of every N packets.

       The  optional  <b>-v</b> ("verbose") parameter causes <b>owltsim</b> to print a message whenever it receives, sends, or
       drops (due to artificial random data loss) a datagram.

       Note that error conditions may cause one delay simulation  (a  pair  of  threads)  to  terminate  without
       terminating any others.

       <b>owltsim</b> is designed to run indefinitely.  To terminate the program, just use control-C to kill it.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       "0" Nominal termination.
       "1" Termination due to an error condition, as noted in printed messages.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here is a sample owltsim configuration file:

       2 7 5502 ptl07.jpl.nasa.gov 5001 75 0
       7 2 5507 ptl02.jpl.nasa.gov 5001 75 16

       This  file  indicates that <b>owltsim</b> will receive on port 5502 the ION traffic from node 2 that is destined
       for node 7, which will receive it at port 5001 on the computer named ptl07.jpl.nasa.gov;  75  seconds  of
       delay  (simulating  a  distance  of  75 light seconds) will be imposed on this transmission activity, and
       <b>owltsim</b> will not simulate any random data loss.

       In the reverse direction, <b>owltsim</b> will receive on port 5507 the ION traffic from node 7 that is  destined
       for  node  2,  which will receive it at port 5001 on the computer named ptl02.jpl.nasa.gov; 75 seconds of
       delay will again be imposed on this transmission activity, and <b>owltsim</b> will randomly discard  (i.e.,  not
       transmit  upon  expiration  of  the transmission delay interval) one datagram out of every 16 received at
       this port.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Not applicable.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables apply.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The following diagnostics may be printed to stdout:

       owltsim can't open configuration file
           The program terminates.

       owltsim failed on fscanf
           Failure on reading the configuration file.  The program terminates.

       owltsim stopped malformed config file line <u>line_number</u>.
           Failure on parsing the configuration file.  The program terminates.

       owltsim can't spawn receiver thread
           The program terminates.

       owltsim out of memory.
           The program terminates.

       owltsim can't open reception socket
           The program terminates.

       owltsim can't initialize reception socket
           The program terminates.

       owltsim can't open transmission socket
           The program terminates.

       owltsim can't initialize transmission socket
           The program terminates.

       owltsim can't spawn timer thread
           The program terminates.

       owltsim can't acquire datagram
           Datagram transmission failed.   This  causes  the  threads  for  the  affected  delay  simulation  to
           terminate, without terminating any other threads.

       owltsim failed on send
           Datagram  transmission  failed.   This  causes  the  threads  for  the  affected  delay simulation to
           terminate, without terminating any other threads.

       at <u>time</u> owltsim LOST a dg of length <u>length</u> from <u>sending</u> <u>node</u> destined for <u>receiving</u> <u>node</u> due to
       ECONNREFUSED.
           This is an informational message.  Due to  an  apparent  bug  in  Internet  protocol  implementation,
           transmission of a datagram on a connected UDP socket occasionally fails.  <b>owltsim</b> does not attempt to
           retransmit the affected datagram.
