       budgie-control-center - Configure Budgie settings

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>budgie-control-center</b> <b>[OPTION...]</b> <b>[PANEL]</b> <b>[ARG...]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>budgie-control-center</b> is a graphical user interface to configure various aspects of Budgie.

       When run without arguments, the shell displays the overview, which shows all available configuration
       panels. The overview allows the opening of individual panels by clicking on them. It also has a search
       entry to find panels by searching keywords.

       It is also possible to specify a panel name as commandline argument to go directly to that panel.
       Individual panels may accept further arguments to specify which tab to open (for multi-tabbed panels) or
       which item to display (for panels with lists).

       Note that <b>budgie-control-center</b> is not meant to expose each and every setting that is available. The
       settings that can be found here represent what is considered useful and commonly needed options. For more
       exotic or uncommon options, you can look at <b>gnome-tweak-tool</b> or the <b>gsettings</b> commandline utility.
