</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dhav2mkv</b> - DHAV video to MKV format converter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dhav2mkv</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dhav2mkv</b> is a standalone tool which converts <b>DHAV</b>(H.264) video to <b>MKV</b>(H.264) video.

       <b>dhav2mkv</b>  only  operates  at media container level, thus the H.264 data is exactly as provided by the DVR
       (with all its bugs).

       <b>dhav2mkv</b> does not support specifying a channel number. It assumes the  stream  holds  a  single  channel,
       instead  of  a  theoretically possible 'n' multiplexed channel stream. The reason that option support was
       dropped is that some DVRs generate DHAV streams with incorrect channel number such way that two  or  more
       channels  collide  with the same channel number, what makes impossible to differentiate one from another.
       Also there's the fact that DHAV multi-channel multiplexing is not used in practice.

       This tool is part of the TaniDVR project.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-i,</b> <b>--in-file</b>
              &lt;input DHAV file&gt; (default: empty -- uses stdin).

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--out-file</b>
              &lt;output MKV file&gt; (default: empty -- uses stdout).

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--sixty-hertz-ntsc</b>
              (default: not enabled).  If defined, assumes NTSC field frequency  to  be  60Hz,  instead  of  the
              typical  59.94Hz.   Some  cameras  do  generate exact 60Hz video.  This switch does NOT affect PAL
              video.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--ts-proc</b>
              0 - No correction will be performed to the buggy DHAV stream timestamps.  1  -  Perform  timestamp
              correction (default).

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Prints help message and exit.

</pre><h4><b>USE</b> <b>CASES</b></h4><pre>
       •  To  convert  already-existing DHAV files to MKV.  Those files may be tanidvr-generated or generated by
          the software included with the DVR itself (due to legacy, or by choice).

          DHAV files are only (currently) playable with the software included with  the  DVR,  while  MKV  is  a
          modern,  open  and  commonly  supported  container format.  Using a standard container also allows the
          video to be recompressed for better storage usage.

       •  To create a video hub (a video repeater), propagating DHAV media which, at the end-point, is converted
          to MKV.

          The DVR itself supports a very limited number of simultaneous connections (usually slighty  more  than
          hardware  channels). Also, near the maximum active connections the DVR tends to be even more unstable.
          Direct connections to the DVR should be kept to essencial minimum.

          <b>dhav2mkv</b> allows the conversion of ongoing DHAV video (doing that with MKV is not viable for  technical
          reasons).  Any  stream starting point (down to byte granularity) is acceptable. Also, temporary source
          interruption with lost/corrupted data suffers automatic resync (what is also done by  'tanidvr',  when
          outputting MKV data).

          A  simple  media  hub  may be implemented with existing complementary software such as ncat (from nmap
          project) with its '<b>--broker</b>' option.

       •  For Digital Forensics. Some police forces already use  <b>dhav2mkv</b>  for  last-step  recovering  of  video
          evidence from apprehended DVRs.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       •  Convert an existing DHAV file to MKV.

                     dhav2mkv -i MyVideo.dhav -o MyVideo.mkv

       •  Using  <b>dhav2mkv</b> instead of tanidvr's internal routines.  NOTE: NOT NECESSARY in practice since tanidvr
          can output MKV directly.  It is shown only for didactic purposes.

                     tanidvr -n 0 -m 1 -t 192.168.0.12 -u admin -w secret1234 -c 2 | dhav2mkv &gt; channel_2_video.mkv

       •  Simple media server and some clients.  NOTE: INSECURE. NOT to be implemented as-is.  It is shown  only
          for didactic purposes.

                     (server at 192.168.20.1)
                     tanidvr -n 0 -m 1 -t 192.168.0.12 -u admin -w secret1234 -c 5 | ncat --broker -l 192.168.20.1 2000

                     (clients ; same/other host)
                     ncat --recv-only 192.168.20.1 2000 | dhav2mkv | mplayer -cache 32 -
                     ncat --recv-only 192.168.20.1 2000 | dhav2mkv &gt; channel_5_realtime_backup.mkv
                     ncat --recv-only 192.168.20.1 2000 &gt; channel_5_realtime_backup.dhav
