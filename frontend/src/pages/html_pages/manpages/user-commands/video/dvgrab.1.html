</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dvgrab — Capture DV or MPEG-2 Transport Stream (HDV) video and audio data from FireWire

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dvgrab</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>base</u>] [-]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dvgrab</b>  is  a program that captures DV or HDV (MPEG2-TS) video and audio data from digital camcorders via
       FireWire (IEEE 1394).  The data is stored in one or several files and can later  be  processed  by  video
       editing  software.   <b>dvgrab</b>  can remote control the camcorder but it does not show the video's content on
       screen.

       <b>dvgrab</b> also supports UVC (USB Video Class) compliant DV devices using Linux kernel module uvcvideo, which
       is a V4L2 driver. In this mode, there is no AV/C VTR control and therefore  interactive  mode  is  almost
       useless.  interactive feature is

       The  <u>base</u> argument is used to construct the filename to store video data: <u>base</u>-<u>num</u>.<u>ext</u>.  <u>num</u> is a running
       number starting from 001, and <u>ext</u> is the file name extension specifying the file format used,  e.g.  avi.
       A  different  naming scheme is used whenever the <b>-timestamp</b>, <b>-timecode</b>, or <b>-timesys</b> is given (see below).
       If <u>base</u> is a full filename including extension, then <b>dvgrab</b> attempts to determine the output file  format
       from the extension, but it still inserts <u>num</u>.  The default value for <u>base</u> is "dvgrab-".

       If  you specify a trailing '-' then the format is forced to raw DV or HDV and sent to stdout. <b>dvgrab</b> will
       also output raw DV or HDV to stdout while capturing to a file if stdout is piped or redirected.

       You can use <b>dvgrab's</b> powerful file writing capabilities with other programs that produce raw DV  or  HDV.
       Using  the <b>-stdin</b> option and if <b>dvgrab</b> detects that it is on the receiving end of a pipe and it is not in
       interactive mode, then it will try to read raw DV or HDV on stdin.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options longer than a single character can be specified with either one or two leading hyphens. Also, you
       can use a space character or equal sign to separate the option name and its argument value.

       <b>-a[</b><u>num</u><b>],</b> <b>-autosplit[=</b><u>num</u><b>]</b>
                 Try to detect whenever a new recording starts, and store it into a separate file. This  can  be
                 combined  with  the  <b>-frames</b>  and  <b>-size</b> options, and a split occurs whenever a specified event
                 arises.  Autosplit is off by default.

                 <u>num</u> is optional. Without it, <b>dvgrab</b> determines when to split using a flag in the  stream  or  a
                 discontinuity  in  the  timecode, where timecode discontinuity is anything backwards or greater
                 than one second.  If you set the optional argument <u>num</u> you can  set  the  time  sensitivity  in
                 seconds  and  ignore  the  stream's new-recording flag. This basically lets you split on larger
                 time increments such as minutes or hours. For example,  <u>-autosplit=3600</u>  splits  the  recording
                 whenever there is a gap in the recording that is an hour or longer.

       <b>-buffers</b> <u>num</u>
                 The number of frames to use for buffering device I/O delays. Defaults to 100.

       <b>-card</b> <u>num</u> Tells  <b>dvgrab</b> to receive data from FireWire card <u>num</u>. The default behaviour is to automatically
                 select the first card containing the first  discovered  camera  If  used  in  conjunction  with
                 <b>-noavc</b>,  then  no bus probing is performed If used in conjunction with <b>-guid</b> <u>hex</u>, then only the
                 specified bus is probed for node with guid <u>hex</u>.

       <b>-channel</b> <u>num</u>
                 Isochronous channel to receive data from. Defaults to 63, which is pretty much  standard  among
                 DV camcorders these days. If you specify anything different, no attempt is made at this time to
                 tell  the  device  which channel to use. You must have some manual way to tell the transmitting
                 device which channel to use.

       <b>-cmincutsize</b> <u>num</u>
                 This option is used to start the collection if a cut occurs <u>num</u> megabytes (actually, mebibytes)
                 prior to the end of the collection. This option reduces small files being  created  when  using
                 the <b>-csize</b> option. When a new collection is started in this manner, the amount of free space in
                 the  previous  collection  is  stored,  and  while  the following clips fit within the previous
                 collection, the new collection starting point is reset.

       <b>-csize</b> <u>num</u>
                 This option tells <b>dvgrab</b> to split the files when the collection of files  exceeds  <u>num</u>  .  This
                 option  is used to create collections of files that fit perfectly into <u>num</u> megabytes (actually,
                 mebibytes) (i.e. for archiving onto DVD). When this occurs, a new collection  is  started  (See
                 also the <b>-cmincutsize</b> option)

       <b>-debug</b> <u>type</u>
                 Display HDV debug info, <u>type</u> is one or more of: all,pat,pmt,pids,pid=N,pes,packet,video,sonya1

       <b>-d,</b> <b>-duration</b> <u>time</u>
                 Set  the maximum capture duration across all file splits for a single capture session (multiple
                 sessions are possible in interactive mode).  The <u>time</u> value is expressed in SMIL2 MediaClipping
                 Time format.  See <a href="http://w3.org/AudioVideo/">http://w3.org/AudioVideo/</a> for the specification.

                 Briefly, the formats are:

                 XXX[.Y]h, XXX[.Y]min, XXX[.Y][s], XXXms,

                 [[HH:]MM:]SS[.ms], or smpte=[[[HH:]MM:]SS:]FF.

       <b>-every</b> <u>n</u>  This option tells <b>dvgrab</b> to write every <u>n</u>'th frame only (default all frames).

       <b>-f,</b> <b>-format</b> <u>dv1</u> <b>|</b> <u>dv2</u> <b>|</b> <u>avi</u> <b>|</b> <u>raw</u> <b>|</b> <u>dif</u> <b>|</b> <u>qt</u> <b>|</b> <u>mov</u> <b>|</b> <u>jpeg</u> <b>|</b> <u>jpg</u> <b>|</b> <u>mpeg2</u> <b>|</b> <u>hdv</u>
                 Specifies the format of the output file(s). File format can also be determined if  you  include
                 an  extension  on  the <u>base</u> name. The following extensions are recognizable: avi, dv, dif, mov,
                 jpg, jpeg, and m2t (HDV).

                 <u>dv1</u> and <u>dv2</u> both are AVI files with slightly different formats.  <u>dv2</u> stores  a  separate  audio
                 track in addition to the DV video track, which is more compatible with other applications.  <u>dv1</u>
                 only  stores  a single, integrated DV track since the DV format natively interleaves audio with
                 video. Therefore, while <u>dv1</u> produces smaller  output,  some  applications  won't  grok  it  and
                 require  <u>dv2</u> instead.  <b>dvgrab</b> is capable of creating extremely large AVI files—well over 2 or 4
                 GB—however, compatibility with other tools starts to decrease over the 1 GB size.

                 <u>raw</u> stores the data unmodified and have the .dv extension. These files are read by a number  of
                 GNU/Linux tools as well as Apple Quicktime.

                 <u>dif</u>  is  a  variation  of  raw  DV  that  names files with a .dif extension so they can be more
                 immediately loaded into MainConcept MainActor5.

                 <u>qt</u> is Quicktime, but requires that dvgrab be compiled with libquicktime.

                 <u>jpg</u> or <u>jpeg</u> is for a sequence of JPEG image  files  if  dvgrab  was  compiled  with  libdv  and
                 jpeglib. This option can only be used with a DV input, not HDV (MPEG2-TS).

                 <u>mpeg2</u>  or  <u>hdv</u>  is  for  a  MPEG-2 transport stream when using, for example, a HDV camcorder or
                 digital TV settop box.

                 Defaults to <u>raw</u>

       <b>-F,</b> <b>-frames</b> <u>num</u>
                 This option tells <b>dvgrab</b> to store at most <u>num</u> frames per file before splitting to a  new  file,
                 where  <u>num</u>  =  0 means ulimited.  The corresponding time depends on the video system used.  PAL
                 shows 25, NTSC about 30 frames per second.

       <b>-guid</b> <u>hex</u> If you have more than one DV device, then select one using the node's  GUID  specified  in  <u>hex</u>
                 (hexadecimal)  format. This is the format as displayed in /proc/bus/ieee1394/devices or the new
                 kernel 2.6 <a href="file:/sys">/sys</a> filesystem. When you specify a GUID, <b>dvgrab</b> will establish (or overlay) a peer-
                 to-peer connection with the device instead of listening to  the  device's  broadcast.   If  you
                 supply  a  <u>hex</u> value of 1, then <b>dvgrab</b> attempts to discover the device as well as setup a peer-
                 to-peer connection. This is especially  handy  with  MPEG2-TS  settop  boxes,  which  typically
                 require a connection management procedure to start transmitting.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>-help</b> Show summary of options.

       <b>-I,</b> <b>-input</b> <u>file</u>
                 Read from <u>file</u> instead of FireWire. You can use '-' for stdin instead of using <b>-stdin</b>.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>-interactive</b>
                 Make  dvgrab  interactive  where single keypresses on stdin control the camera VTR or start and
                 stop capture. Otherwise, dvgrab runs in session mode, where it immediately starts  capture  and
                 stops as directed or interrupted (ctrl-c).

       <b>-jpeg-deinterlace</b>
                 If using <b>-format</b> <b>jpeg</b>, deinterlace the output by doubling the lines of the upper field. This is
                 a cheap form of deinterlace that results in an effective 50% loss in resolution.

       <b>-jpeg-height</b> <u>num</u>
                 If using <b>-format</b> <b>jpeg</b>, scale the output of the height to <u>num</u> (1 - 2048).

       <b>-jpeg-overwrite</b> <u>name</u>
                 Write to same image file for each frame, instead of creating a sequence of image files.

       <b>-jpeg-quality</b> <u>num</u>
                 If using <b>-format</b> <b>jpeg</b>, set the JPEG quality level from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).

       <b>-jpeg-temp</b> <u>name</u> <u>10</u>
                 Use  a  temporary  file  to create the jpeg, rename the file to the target file name when done.
                 Useful when using dvgrab with <b>-jpeg-overwrite</b> for generating a webcam image.

       <b>-jpeg-width</b> <u>num</u>
                 If using <b>-format</b> <b>jpeg</b>, scale the output of the width to <u>num</u> (1 - 2048).

                 The JPEG scaling width and height must be both either less than  or  greater  than  the  normal
                 frame size. For example, the scaled size of 700 wide by 525 high yields a nice 4:3 aspect image
                 with square pixels, but it is illegal for NTSC because 700 is less than the normal width of 720
                 while the height is greater than the normal height of 480.

                 Since  DV  uses  non-square pixels, it is nice to be able to scale to an image based upon a 4:3
                 aspect ratio using square pixels. For NTSC, example sizes are 800x600,  640x480,  and  320x240.
                 For PAL, example square pixel sizes are 384x270 and 768x540.

       <b>-jvc-p25</b>  Remove  repeat_first_field flag and set frames per second to 25 to correct a stream recorded in
                 JVC's HDV P25 mode.

       <b>-lockstep</b> Align capture to a multiple of <b>-frames</b> based on timecode.  This is useful for redundancy,  when
                 more  than  one machine is capturing from the same FireWire device, and you want to ensure each
                 file contains the same footage. To ensure the files from each machine have the  same  name  use
                 the <b>-timecode</b> option and the same <u>base</u> name.

       <b>-lockstep_maxdrops</b> <u>num</u>
                 If  <u>num</u>  frames  are  dropped consecutively, then close the file and resume capture on the next
                 lockstop interval. If <u>num</u> is -1, then permit  an  unlimited  number  of  consecutively  dropped
                 frames; this is the default.

       <b>-lockstep_totaldrops</b> <u>num</u>
                 If  <u>num</u>  frames  are dropped in the current file, then close the file and resume capture on the
                 next lockstep interval. If <u>num</u> is -1, then permit an unlimited number of total dropped  frames;
                 this is the default.

       <b>-noavc</b>    Disable  use  of AV/C VTR control. This is useful if you are capturing live video from a camera
                 because in camera mode, an AV/C play command tells the camera to start recording, perhaps  over
                 material  on  the  current  tape.   This  applies to either interactive more or non-interactive
                 because non-interactive stills sends a play and stop to the VTR upon capture start and stop.

       <b>-nostop</b>   Disables sending the AV/C VTR stop command when exiting <b>dvgrab</b>.

       <b>-opendml</b>  If using <b>-format</b> <b>dv2</b>, create an OpenDML-compliant type 2 DV AVI. This is  required  to  support
                 dv2 files &gt;1GB. dv1 always supports files &gt;1GB.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>-recordonly</b>
                 When  the  camcorder  is  in  record  mode,  this option causes <b>dvgrab</b> to only capture when the
                 camcorder is recording and not paused. Normally, when in record mode, dvgrab always captures to
                 let you use the camcorder purely as a camera where the computer operator is  in  control.  This
                 option  makes  dvgrab  act  like  the VCR where the camera operator controls when capture takes
                 place.  This is very handy when used with the <b>-autosplit</b> option to automatically create  a  new
                 file for each shot.  This option requires AV/C and will not work with the <b>-noavc</b> option.

       <b>-rewind</b>   Rewind  the  tape  completely  to  the  beginning  prior  to starting capture.  Naturally, this
                 requires AV/C; however, perhaps not so obvious is that this does not apply to interactive mode.

       <b>-showstatus</b>
                 Normally, the capture status information is displayed after finished writing to each file. This
                 option makes it show the capture status during capture, updated for each frame.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>-size</b> <u>num</u>
                 This option tells <b>dvgrab</b> to store at most <u>num</u> megabytes (actually, mebibytes) per  file,  where
                 <u>num</u> = 0 means unlimited file size for large files. The default size limit is 1024 MB.

       <b>-srt</b>      Generate  subtitle  files  containing the recording date and time in SRT format. For each video
                 file that is created two additional files with the extension .srt0 and .srt1 are created.  They
                 contain the recording date and time as subtitles in the SRT format. The .srt0 file contains the
                 subtitles  with  timing based on the running time from the start of the current file.  Use this
                 file if you transcode to a format like AVI. The .srt1 file contains the subtitles  with  timing
                 based  on  the time code as delivered by the camera.  The mplayer program understands this type
                 of subtitles.

       <b>-stdin</b>    Read the DV stream from a pipe on stdin instead of FireWire.

       <b>-timecode</b> Put the timecode of the first frame of each file into the file name.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>-timestamp</b>
                 Put information on date and time of recording into file name.

       <b>-timesys</b>  Put system rather than recording date and time into file  name.   This  is  useful  when  using
                 converter devices that do not change the recording date time in the DV stream.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>-v4l2</b> Capture  from  a  USB Video Class (UVC) device that supports DV.  This uses the uvcvideo kernel
                 module via V4L2.  The default device file is  /dev/video.  Use  the  <b>-input</b>  option  to  set  a
                 different device file.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>-version</b>
                 Show version of program.

       <b>-24p</b>      For  Quicktime  DV,  set  the  frame  rate as 24 fps in the Quicktime file.  This only works as
                 expected when the video has been shot in 24p mode.

       <b>-24pa</b>     For Quicktime, DV, in addition to setting the frame rate to 24  in  the  Quicktime  file,  also
                 reverse  the  2:3:3:2 pulldown process by removing the interlaced "C" frame. This only works as
                 expected when the video has been shot in 24p Advanced mode. See <a href="http://www.adamwilt.com/24p/">http://www.adamwilt.com/24p/</a>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dvgrab</b> <b>foo-</b>
                 Captures video data from the default FireWire  source  and  stores  it  to  files  <b>foo-001.avi</b>,
                 <b>foo-002.avi</b>, etc.

       <b>dvgrab</b> <b>-frames</b> <b>25</b> <b>foo-</b>
                 Assuming a PAL video source, this command records one second's worth of video data per file.

       <b>dvgrab</b> <b>-autosplit</b> <b>-frames</b> <b>750</b> <b>-timestamp</b> <b>foo-</b>
                 Records  video  data  from  the  default  FireWire  source,  cuts  it into chunks of 30 seconds
                 (assuming PAL) or when a new recording starts and names the resulting files according  to  date
                 and time info in the videostream.

       <b>dvgrab</b> <b>-autosplit</b> <b>-size</b> <b>1998</b> <b>-csize</b> <b>4400</b> <b>-cmincutsize</b> <b>10</b>  <b>foo-</b>
                 Records  video  data from the default FireWire source, cuts it into chunks when a new recording
                 starts or when the current file exceeds 1998 megabytes (actually, mebibytes),  or  the  current
                 collection  of files exceeds 4400 megabytes. It also reduces the size of the smallest file made
                 due to a collection size cut to 10 megabytes.

                 This option is perfect for backing up DV to DVD's as 2 Gb is around the maximum file size  that
                 (the current) linux implementation of the ISO9660 filesystem can handle!

                 Warning:  It  is  possible  to  make  ISO9660 filesystems with files greater than 2 Gb, but the
                 current linux IS09660 driver can't read them! Newer linux kernels may be able to handle ISO9660
                 filesystems with filesizes greater than 2 Gb.

       <b>dvgrab</b> <b>-format</b> <b>hdv</b> <b>-autosplit</b>
                 Capture from a HDV camcorder.

       <b>dvgrab</b> <b>-format</b> <b>mpeg2</b> <b>-guid</b> <b>1</b>
                 Record from a digital TV settop box.

       <b>dvgrab</b> <b>-jpeg-over</b> <b>-jpeg-w=320</b> <b>-jpeg-h=240</b> <b>-d</b> <b>smpte=1</b> <b>webcam.jpeg</b>
                 Capture a single frame, save it as a  JPEG  named  webcam.jpg  and  exit.   This  example  also
                 demonstrates option handling. You only need to specify enough of a long option name to uniquely
                 identify  it.  You  can  use space or equal sign to separate option name and argument. The file
                 format is inferred from the filename  extension.  Also,  since  <b>-jpeg-overwrite</b>  is  used,  the
                 filename will be exactly "webcam.jpeg" and not include any numbers.

       <b>dvgrab</b> <b>-V</b> Capture over USB from a UVC compliant DV device.

       <b>dvgrab</b> <b>-v4l</b> <b>-input</b> <b>/dev/video1</b>
                 Capture over USB from a UVC compliant DV device using device file /dev/video1.

       <b>dvgrab</b> <b>-format=hdv</b> <b>-autosplit=28800</b> <b>-srt</b> <b>foo-</b>
                 Capture  from  a  HDV  camcorder, splitting whenever there is a gap in the recording that lasts
                 longer than 8 hours. This will likely generate a separate file for each day (useful for holiday
                 videos). It will also  generate  subtitle  files.  Assuming  that  the  files  foo-001.m2t  and
                 foo-002.m2t  are generated, the corresponding subtitle files will be foo-001.srt0, foo-001.srt1
                 and foo-002.srt0, foo-002.srt1.  You can use the subtitle files to show the recording date  and
                 time while viewing the video.
