       lavplay - Playback and edit MJPEG video

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lavplay</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>lavfile1</u> <u>[lavfile2</u> <u>...</u> <u>lavfileN]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lavplay</b>  can be used to playback video in MJPEG format (either quicktime or AVI) on a zoran video-capture
       device, such as the Miro/Pinnacle DC10(+), the Iomega Buz or Linux Media Labs' LML33, or in software mode
       (using SDL).

       It also provides mechanisms for non-destructive editting video using an  interactive  front-end  such  as
       <b><a href="../man1/glav.1.html">glav</a></b>(1).  See <b>SEARCHING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>EDITING</b> below for details.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lavplay</b> accepts the following options:

       <b>-p/--playback</b> [<b>S</b>|<b>C</b>|<b>H</b>]
               The playback mode to be used. 'S' means software-playback using SDL.
                'H'  means  hardware-playback  on  the  monitor  (on-screen). 'C' means hardware-playback to the
               video-out of the zoran video-capture device.  Obviously, 'C' and 'H' only work on computers  with
               zoran video-capture devices.

       <b>-Z/--full-screen</b>
               Full-screen playback. This works if SDL- or onscreen-playback is chosen.

       <b>--size</b> <u>NxN</u>
               Size of the video window (default: size of the input video) when using software (SDL) or hardware
               onscreen playback

       <b>-a/--audio</b> <u>num</u>
               When play audio, 0 means never, or sum of
                 1: while playing forward,
                 2: while playing reverse,
                 4: even fast playing,
                 8: while pausing
               (default: 7: forward/reverse/fast).  If 8(pausing) was contained, lavplay will be very noisy, but
               useful when you want to edit by sound.

       <b>-z/--zoom</b>
               Zooms the video to fit the screen as good as possible.

       <b>-x</b>      Exchange  fields  of  an  interlaced  video.  Try this if the video looks weird.  It shouldn't be
               necessary with stuff captured using <a href="../man1/lavrec.1.html">lavrec</a>(1) but could be needed for other sources.

       <b>-s/--skip</b> <u>num</u>
               Skip &lt;num&gt; seconds of video at the beginning.

       <b>-x/--exchange-fields</b>
               Invert field order (for videos which are recorded with wrong field order interlacing settings)

       <b>-F/--flicker</b>
               Disable stills flicker reduction.  This is useful if you want to see stills exactly as they  were
               recorded rather than flicker-free!

       <b>-c/--synchronization</b> [<b>0</b>|<b>1</b>]
               Enables  (1)  or  disables  (0) the use of sync corrections. Basically, you almost certainly want
               this.  Disabling is really there for diagnostic purposes and not much else.

       <b>-H/--H-offset</b> <u>num,</u> <b>-V/--V-offset</b> <u>num</u>
               Horizontal (-H) and vertical (-V) offset when using  hardware-playback.   Offset  plus  width  or
               height  should  be  smaller  than  or equal to the playback device's maximum allowed size (DC10+:
               640x480 or 768x576, LML33/Marvel/Buz: 720x480/576).

       <b>--s-x-offset</b> <u>num,</u> <b>--s-y-offset</b> <u>num</u>
               Offset for the video window (from top left screen corner) when using hardware  onscreen  playback
               in non-fullscreen mode.

       <b>--display</b> <u>:x.x</u>
               When using hardware fullsreen video playback (-pH), this setting can be used to specify the video
               display (default: :0.0) to use for video display.

       <b>-q/--no-quit</b>
               Makes  lavplay  stay  alive  at the end of the video (lavplay won't quit).  Use 'q&lt;enter&gt;' on the
               command line to quit (see below, <b>SEARCHING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>EDITING</b>).

       <b>-g/--gui-mode</b>
               Enables GUI-mode. This is used by glav and  Linux  Video  Studio.  It  will  output  the  current
               position  in  the video each frame, so that the glav or LVS can keep track of where we are in the
               video which is being played back.

       <b>-P/--preserve-pathnames</b>
               This is used by glav and Linux Video Studio.  When editlists are created the  original  pathnames
               for files are used and not the canonicalised pathnames from the root directory.  Useful if you've
               got  things  like automounters active that make directories with the same non-canonical name have
               different canonical names on different machines.

       <b>-U/--use-write</b>
               Use the write() system call rather than the mmap() system call for audio  writing  to  the  sound
               device.   This may fix some audio playback problems.

       <b>-n/--mjpeg-buffers</b> <u>num</u>
               Number of MJPEG-buffers. Default is 32. Try changing this number if you have many lost frames.

       <b>-v/--verbose</b> <u>num</u>
               Verbosity level (0, 1 or 2)

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables can be recognized by lavrec:

       <b>LAV_VIDEO_DEV</b>
               The video device. Default is /dev/video

       <b>LAV_AUDIO_DEV</b>
               The audio device. Default is /dev/dsp

</pre><h4><b>SEARCHING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>EDITING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lavplay</b>  can do more than simple plain playback. It is also intended to be controlled using commands sent
       via stdin from a front-end like <b><a href="../man1/glav.1.html">glav</a>(1)</b> or similar,  more  sophisticated  tools.   The  most  significant
       aspect  of this functionality is the ability to create <u>edit</u> <u>list</u> files giving the playback sequence of an
       editted version of the input video.  The edit  list  file  can  be  read  by  any  of  the  <a href="../man1/mjpegtools.1.html">mjpegtools</a>(1)
       (including  lavplay!) wherever an actual video file would be acceptable.  Such edit lists record only the
       original source file and start and stop frames of the components of the  editted  video  editting  rather
       than  the  video  itself.   As  such  editting leaves the original files unchanged and requires only tiny
       amounts of data-movement.  The drawback is that for the edit list to work the original files must  remain
       unchanged,  and  that interactive play may be jumpy due to the playback sequence "skipping about" between
       different parts of the original video sequence.

       If a stand-alone consolidated versions of editted video is required it can be  produced  by  running  the
       <a href="../man1/lavtrans.1.html">lavtrans</a>(1) utility on the edit list.

       Edit  list  files  are  plain  text with a very simple syntax to allow easy manual editting using a text-
       editor or writing of scripted editting tools.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The commands accepted on standard input sre as follows (and can of course be entered directly by command-
       line junkies):

       <b>+,</b> <b>-</b>    Goes to next/previous frame. Only makes sense when the video is paused.

       <b>pN</b>      Sets playback speed to N (N=..., -1, 0, 1, ...)

       <b>a[01]</b>   Enables/disables audio playback

       <b>sN</b>      if N is a number, this means to go to frame N. if N is prefixed by a + or -, this means to  go  N
               frames back- or forward.

       <b>om</b> <b>editlist</b> <b>[N1</b> <b>N2</b> <b>[N3</b> <b>N4]]</b>
               Opens  a movie or editlist. A second and third argument can specify to only open a specific range
               of frames from this video (N1=-1 means whole video). N3  and  N4  can  specify  to  show  only  a
               specific range of frames from the frames which were just opened (useful for trimming).

       <b>w[as]</b> <b>file</b>
               Save the current editlist (a) or the current selection (s) to a file.

       <b>q</b>       Quit lavplay.

       <b>e[ou]</b> <b>N1</b> <b>N2</b>
               Cuts (u) or copies (o) frames N1-N2 from the current editlist into an internal selection.

       <b>ep</b>      Pastes the contents of the selection into the current position in the editlist.

       <b>em</b> <b>N1</b> <b>N2</b> <b>N3</b>
               Moves frames N1-N2 to position N3 in the video.

       <b>ed</b> <b>N1</b> <b>N2</b>
               Deletes frames N1-N2 from the editlist.

       <b>ea</b> <b>video</b> <b>N1</b> <b>N2</b> <b>N3</b>
               Adds  frames  N1-N2  of  the  video into position N3 within the editlist.  N1=-1 means to add the
               whole video.

       <b>es</b> <b>N1</b> <b>N2</b>
               Sets the current viewable frames within the whole video to N1-N2. This is useful for trimming.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Editlists record absolute pathnames.  This more or less forces manual editting of the pathnames  in  them
       if it is desired to move editlists and source video files.

       lavplay  really  ought  to  make  a decent job of detecting what playback options are feasible (on-screen
       hardware, video-out port hardware, software) and set the default playback mode appropriately.   Alas,  it
       does not.
