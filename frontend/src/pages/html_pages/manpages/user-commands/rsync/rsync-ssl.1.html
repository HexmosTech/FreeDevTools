</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rsync-ssl - a helper script for connecting to an ssl rsync daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       rsync-ssl [--type=SSL_TYPE] RSYNC_ARGS

       The   online   version  of  this  manpage  (that  includes  cross-linking  of  topics)  is  available  at
       https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync-ssl.1.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The rsync-ssl script helps you  to  run  an  rsync  copy  to/from  an  rsync  daemon  that  requires  ssl
       connections.

       The  script  requires  that  you  specify  an  rsync-daemon arg in the style of either <b>hostname::</b> (with 2
       colons) or <b>rsync://hostname/</b>.  The default port used for connecting is 874 (one higher  than  the  normal
       873) unless overridden in the environment.  You can specify an overriding port via <b>--port</b> or by including
       it  in  the normal spot in the URL format, though both of those require your rsync version to be at least
       3.2.0.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If the <b>first</b> arg is a <b>--type=SSL_TYPE</b> option, the script will only use that particular program to open an
       ssl connection instead of trying to find  an  openssl  or  stunnel  executable  via  a  simple  heuristic
       (assuming  that  the  <b>RSYNC_SSL_TYPE</b>  environment variable is not set as well -- see below).  This option
       must specify one of <b>openssl</b> or <b>stunnel</b>.  The equal sign is required for this particular option.

       All the other options are passed through to the rsync command, so consult the <b><a href="../man1/rsync.1.html">rsync</a></b>(1) manpage  for  more
       information on how it works.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The ssl helper scripts are affected by the following environment variables:

       <b>RSYNC_SSL_TYPE</b>
              Specifies  the  program  type  that  should be used to open the ssl connection.  It must be one of
              <b>openssl</b> or <b>stunnel</b>.  The <b>--type=SSL_TYPE</b> option overrides this, when specified.

       <b>RSYNC_SSL_PORT</b>
              If specified, the value is the port number that is used as the default  when  the  user  does  not
              specify a port in their rsync command.  When not specified, the default port number is 874.  (Note
              that  older rsync versions (prior to 3.2.0) did not communicate an overriding port number value to
              the helper script.)

       <b>RSYNC_SSL_CERT</b>
              If specified, the value is a filename that contains a certificate to use for the connection.

       <b>RSYNC_SSL_KEY</b>
              If specified, the value is a filename that contains a key for the provided certificate to use  for
              the connection.

       <b>RSYNC_SSL_CA_CERT</b>
              If  specified,  the  value is a filename that contains a certificate authority certificate that is
              used to validate the connection.

       <b>RSYNC_SSL_OPENSSL</b>
              Specifies the openssl executable  to  run  when  the  connection  type  is  set  to  openssl.   If
              unspecified, the $PATH is searched for "openssl".

       <b>RSYNC_SSL_GNUTLS</b>
              Specifies  the  gnutls-cli  executable  to  run  when  the  connection  type is set to gnutls.  If
              unspecified, the $PATH is searched for "gnutls-cli".

       <b>RSYNC_SSL_STUNNEL</b>
              Specifies the stunnel executable  to  run  when  the  connection  type  is  set  to  stunnel.   If
              unspecified, the $PATH is searched first for "stunnel4" and then for "stunnel".

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
           rsync-ssl -aiv example.com::mod/ dest

           rsync-ssl --type=openssl -aiv example.com::mod/ dest

           rsync-ssl -aiv --port 9874 example.com::mod/ dest

           rsync-ssl -aiv rsync://example.com:9874/mod/ dest

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>SERVER</b> <b>SIDE</b></h4><pre>
       For help setting up an SSL/TLS supporting rsync, see the instructions in rsyncd.conf.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man1/rsync.1.html">rsync</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man5/rsyncd.conf.5.html">rsyncd.conf</a></b>(5)

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that using an stunnel connection requires at least version 4 of stunnel, which should be the case on
       modern  systems.  Also, it does not verify a connection against the CA certificate collection, so it only
       encrypts the connection without any cert validation unless you have specified the certificate environment
       options.

       This script also supports a <b>--type=gnutls</b> option, but at the time of this release the gnutls-cli  command
       was  dropping  output,  making it unusable.  If that bug has been fixed in your version, feel free to put
       gnutls into an exported RSYNC_SSL_TYPE environment variable to make its use the default.
