</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>g.extension</u> downloads and installs, removes or updates extensions (addons) from the  official  GRASS  GIS
       Addons repository or from user-specified source code repositories into the local GRASS GIS installation.

       Two types of extensions are supported:

           •   Python  scripts:  they  are  installed  without  the need of compilation or (usually) the need of
               special dependencies.

           •   Source code (mostly written in C programming language; may also be written  in  C++,  Fortran  or
               other  languages):  while  on  MS-Windows systems the requested GRASS GIS extension is downloaded
               pre-compiled from the GRASS GIS site, on Unix based systems the installation is preceded  by  the
               automated  download  of  the  extension’s  source  code  along  with  subsequent  compilation and
               installation.  This requires a compiler environment to be present on the user’s computer.

   <b>Managing</b> <b>installed</b> <b>extensions</b>
       Re-running <u>g.extension</u> on an installed GRASS GIS Addon  extension  re-installs  the  requested  extension
       which may include updates.

       To bulk-update all locally installed GRASS GIS extensions, <u>g.extension.all</u> module is available.

   <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>extensions</b> <b>are</b> <b>installed</b>
       GRASS GIS extensions are installed by <u>g.extension</u> into a dedicated directory.  The default is a directory
       for   application   data   and   settings   inside  the  user’s  home  directory.   On  GNU/Linux  it  is
       $HOME/.grass8/addons, on MS-Windows it is %APPDATA%\Roaming\GRASS8\addons.  The name of the directory  is
       stored in the GRASS_ADDON_BASE environmental variable.

       The  flag <b>-s</b> changes this install target directory to the GRASS GIS installation directory (determined by
       GISBASE  environmental  variable,  e.g.  <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>)  rather  than  the  default  directory  defined  as   per
       GRASS_ADDON_BASE  (see  also documentation for variables).  <u>g.extension</u> checks if the user has permission
       to write to GISBASE or GRASS_ADDON_BASE.

       The place where the extensions are installed can be customized by the option <b>prefix</b>. Ensuring that  these
       extensions will be accessible in GRASS GIS is in this case in the responsibility of the user.

   <b>Source</b> <b>code</b> <b>sources</b> <b>and</b> <b>repositories</b>
   <b>GRASS</b> <b>GIS</b> <b>Addons</b> <b>repository</b> <b>on</b> <b>GitHub</b>
       By  default,  <u>g.extension</u>  installs  extensions  from  the  official  GRASS GIS Addons GitHub repository.
       However, different sources can be specified using the <b>url</b> option.

       Individual extensions can also be installed by providing a URL to the source  code  on  GitHub  or  OSGeo
       Trac. The latter, however, works only for certain directories where the download of ZIP files was enabled
       by project administrators of the trac server.

   <b>Local</b> <b>source</b> <b>code</b> <b>directory</b>
       Optionally,  new  extension can be also installed from a source code placed in a local directory on disk.
       This is advantageous when developing a new module.  To keep the directory clean, the directory content is
       copied to a temporary directory and the compilation happens there.

   <b>Source</b> <b>code</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ZIP</b> <b>or</b> <b>TAR</b> <b>archive</b>
       In addition, new extension can be also installed from a ZIP file or an archive file from the  TAR  family
       (e.g., .tar.gz or .bz2).  The file can be on disk (specified with a path), or on the web (specified by an
       URL).

   <b>Online</b> <b>repositories:</b> <b>GitHub,</b> <b>GitLab</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bitbucket</b>
       For  well  known  general hosting services, namely GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket, <u>g.extension</u> supports the
       download of a repository.  Here the user only needs to provide a base URL  to  the  repository  web  page
       (with  or  without  the  https:// part).  For GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket, the latest source code in the
       default branch is downloaded, unless a specific branch is requested in the <u>branch</u> option.  Of  course,  a
       user  can  still  specify the full URL of a ZIP file e.g. for a specific release and install the archived
       code in this way (ZIP file mechanism will be applied).

       For the official repository, <u>g.extension</u> supports listing available extensions  (addons)  and  few  other
       metadata-related   operations  which  depend  on  a  specific  infrastructure.   For  other  sources  and
       repositories, this is not supported because it is assumed that other sources contain only one  extension,
       typically a module or group of modules with a Makefile at the root of the repository.

   <b>Needed</b> <b>directory</b> <b>layout</b>
       When  none  of  the  above  sources  is  identified,  <u>g.extension</u>  assumes that the source is in a GitHub
       repository and uses the <u>git</u> command line tool to obtain the source code. The expected  structure  of  the
       repository should be the same as the one of the official repository.

       Non-official sources are supported on all operating systems except for MS-Windows.

   <b>Compilation</b> <b>and</b> <b>installation</b>
       On  MS-Windows  systems, where compilation tools are typically not readily locally installed, <u>g.extension</u>
       downloads a precompiled executable from the GRASS GIS project server.  On  all  other  operating  systems
       where  it  is  not  difficult  to install compilation tools, <u>g.extension</u> downloads the source code of the
       requested extension (addon) and compiles it locally.  This applies for both C and Python modules as  well
       as  any  other  extensions. The reason is that more things such as manual page are compiled, not only the
       source code (which is really necessary to compile just in case of C).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Download</b> <b>and</b> <b>install</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>extension</b>
       Download and install <u>r.stream.distance</u> into current GRASS installation
       g.extension extension=r.stream.distance
       This installs the extension from the official repository.  For convenience, a shorter syntax can be used:
       g.extension r.stream.distance

   <b>Download</b> <b>and</b> <b>install</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>extension</b> <b>when</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> <b>proxy</b>
       Example for an open http proxy:
       # syntax: <a href="http://proxyurl">http://proxyurl</a>:proxyport
       g.extension extension=r.stream.distance proxy="http=<a href="http://proxy.example.com">http://proxy.example.com</a>:8080"

       Example for a proxy with proxy authentication:
       # syntax: <a href="http://username">http://username</a>:password@proxyurl:proxyport
       g.extension extension=r.stream.distance proxy="http=<a href="http://username">http://username</a>:<a href="mailto:password@proxy.example.com">password@proxy.example.com</a>:8080"

   <b>Managing</b> <b>the</b> <b>extensions</b>
       List all available extensions in the official GRASS GIS Addons repository:
       g.extension -l
       List all locally installed extensions:
       g.extension -a
       Removal of a locally installed extension:
       g.extension extension=r.stream.distance operation=remove

   <b>Installing</b> <b>from</b> <b>various</b> <b>online</b> <b>repositories:</b> <b>GitHub,</b> <b>GitLab,</b> <b>Bitbucket</b>
       Simple URL to GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket repositories:
       g.extension r.example.plus url="https://github.com/wenzeslaus/r.example.plus"
       Simple URL to GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket repositories from a specific (e.g. development) branch:
       g.extension r.example.plus url="https://github.com/wenzeslaus/r.example.plus" branch=master
       Simple URL to OSGeo Trac (downloads a ZIP file, requires download to be enabled in Trac):
       g.extension r.example url=trac.osgeo.org/.../r.example
       In general, when a ZIP file or other archive is provided, the full URL can be used:
       g.extension r.example url=<a href="http://example.com/.../r.example">http://example.com/.../r.example</a>?format=zip
       Note that because of MS-Windows operating system architecture, only official repository is  supported  on
       this platform.

   <b>Install</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> <b>version</b> <b>from</b> <b>Addons</b>
       To  install  a specific version from GRASS GIS Addons, specify the full URL pointing to Trac code browser
       and include Subversion  revision  number.  For  example,  this  installs  the  version  number  57854  of
       r.local.relief module:
       g.extension r.local.relief url="https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass-addons/grass7/raster/r.local.relief?rev=57854&amp;format=zip"

   <b>Installing</b> <b>when</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>module</b> <b>locally</b>
       Having source code of a GRASS module in a directory on disk one can install it using:
       g.extension r.example url=/local/directory/r.example/

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       In  order  to  clone source code repositories, the <u>git</u> command line tool is required. The installation of
       single AddOns is most efficient with versions of git that support so called <u>sparse</u>  <u>checkout</u>,  which  was
       introduced  with  version  2.25.  With  older  versions  of  git,  the  entire  AddOns repository will be
       downloaded.  On UNIX like systems, installation is done with the  <u>make</u>  command  line  tool.  For  AddOns
       written in C / C++, a respective build environment is needed.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       Toolboxes in the official repository cannot be downloaded.

       On  MS-Windows,  only the official repository is working because there is no way of compiling the modules
       (a Python replacement for Python scripts should be implemented).

</pre><h4><b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       Since extensions have to be compiled on Unix based  systems  (Linux,  Mac  OSX  etc.)   unless  a  Python
       extension is installed, a full compiler environment must be present on the user’s computer.

   <b>ERROR:</b> <b>Please</b> <b>install</b> <b>GRASS</b> <b>development</b> <b>package</b>
       While  GRASS  GIS  is available on the user’s computer, the respective development package is lacking. If
       GRASS was installed from a (Linux) repository, also the grass-dev* package (commonly named "grass-dev" or
       "grass-devel", sometimes along with the version number) must be installed.
