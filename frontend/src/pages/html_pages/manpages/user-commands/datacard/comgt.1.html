</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       comgt  - Option GlobeTrotter GPRS/EDGE/3G/HSDPA  and Vodafone 3G/GPRS datacard control tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>comgt</b> -d <u>device</u> -ehstvVx <u>script</u>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
            <b>-d</b> <u>device</u>
                      set  the device to be used to communicate with the data-card.  If not specified then comgt
                      trys <u>/dev/noz2,</u> <u>/dev/ttyUSB2</u> and then <u>/dev/modem</u>

            <b>-e</b>
                      turn on serial communications echo.

            <b>-h</b>
                      display summary help and exit.

            <b>-s</b>
                      don´t run the internal <u>default</u> script before an external script.

            <b>-t</b>
                      change to an alternate line terminator (default "0).

            <b>-v</b>
                      run in verbose mode. This traces scripts as they are executed.  It is intended to help  in
                      debugging scripts.

            <b>-V</b>
                      Print Version information.

            <b>-x</b>
                      for  internal  and  external  scripts, any reference to 115200 baud is converted to 57600.
                      This is useful for data cards that don't like 115200 baud such as the GlobeTrotter EDGE.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>comgt</b> is a scripting language interpreter useful for establishing  communications  on  serial  lines  and
       through PCMCIA modems as well as GPRS and 3G datacards.

       <b>comgt</b> has some features that are rarely found in other utilities of the same type.

   <b>Features</b>
       - Pre-defined built-in scripts for 2G/3G datacard control
       - Simple, BASIC-like script language.
       - Command-line and file sourcing of script.
       - Multi-response waitfor.
       - waitquiet permits line stabilization.
       - In-line text capture.
       - Multi-process support: fork, wait, kill, exit.
       - Debugging verbose and log output.
       - logging to file.
       - Flow control: goto, gosub, return, if, else.
       - Low-impact on system resources.
       - Time commands and functions.
       - String manipulations.
       - Environment manipulation: env(), putenv.
       - External utilities system calls: system, exec.

   <b>Supported</b> <b>GPRS</b> <b>and</b> <b>3G</b> <b>datacards</b>
       <b>comgt</b>  has  been  tested  against GlobeTrotter GPRS,EDGE, Combo EDGE, 3G, 3G EDGE, HSDPA and GlobeTrotter
       Fusion as well as Vodafone 3G.  It can set the PIN and display information about datacards before  a  PPP
       connection  is  started.   Additionally,  because  the  GlobeTrotter and Vodafone 3G/GPRS datacard have a
       secondary serial interface, these datacards can be monitored while a PPP connection is in  existence  and
       transferring data.

       <b>comgt</b>  is  primarily  designed  to work with the GlobeTrotter range of datacards but should be compatible
       with any other GPRS or 3G datacard provided its interface is implemented as one or  more  serial  or  USB
       serial  devices and it is controlled and queried by an implementation of the Hayes command interface with
       the same AT command extensions used by the listed datacards.

   <b>Using</b> <b>comgt</b>
       <b>comgt</b> has only one function: to run a script. This may be one of a number of "standard" internal  scripts
       or an external script. Both types of script are invoked in the same way. The "standard" scripts are built
       into  <b>comgt</b>  and  will  work for serially connected modems, built-in modems, PCMCIA modems as well as the
       GlobeTrotter GPRS and the Vodafone 3G/GPRS datacards.  There is a search priority  order  for  scripts  -
       1)internal, 2)working directory, 3)/etc/comgt

   <b>Built-in</b> <b>scripts</b>
  <u>comgt</u>
       This  runs  the  default  internal  script.  Running  <b>comgt</b>  without any script specified, e.g., <u>comgt</u> <u>-d</u>
       <u>/dev/ttyS1</u> it will check for a PIN and prompt you if it is required. The next thing it does is  wait  for
       the  device  to  register,  it then reports the signal strength.  If you don´t specify a port with the <b>-d</b>
       option then <u>/dev/modem</u> is assumed.  If the -s switch is not used then this default script is  run  before
       any external script.

  <u>comgt</u> <u>help</u>
       Lists these and the other options available.

  <u>comgt</u> <u>info</u>
       Lists the datacard configuration.

  <u>comgt</u> <u>sig</u>
       Prints the signal strength.

  <u>comgt</u> <u>reg</u>
       Prints the registration state.

  <u>comgt</u> <u>3G</u>
       Puts a GlobeTrotter 3G/Fusion and Vodafone 3G into 3G network only mode (UMTS/HSDPA).

  <u>comgt</u> <u>2G</u>
       Puts a GlobeTrotter 3G/Fusion and Vodafone 3G into 2G network only mode (GSM/GPRS/EDGE).

  <u>comgt</u> <u>3G2G</u>
       Puts a GlobeTrotter 3G/Fusion and Vodafone 3G into 3G preferred mode (UMTS/HSDPA and GSM/GPRS/EDGE).

  <u>comgt</u> <u>GTEDGE</u>
       Use  this command to initialise GlobeTrotter EDGE and GlobeTrotter Combo EDGE cards before doing anything
       else. (It switches on the radio).

  <u>comgt</u> <u>USA</u>
       Switch to 900/1900 MHz band for USA operation. GlobeTrotter GPRS datacards only.

  <u>comgt</u> <u>EUROPE</u>
       Switch to 900/1800 MHz band for European operation. GlobeTrotter GPRS datacards only.

  <u>comgt</u> <u>PIN</u>
       Test the SIM PIN status and use the environment variable COMGTPIN as the value .

  <u>comgt</u> <u>APN</u>
       Set the APN of the datacard to the value contained in the COMGTAPN environment variable.

   <b>Custom</b> <b>Scripts</b>
       As well as built in scripts you can make your own. The following script sets a Vodafone  3G  datacard  or
       Option Fusion card´s UMTS mode to GPRS:

            #Set GPRS only mode
            set com 115200n81
            set senddelay 0.05
            waitquiet 1 0.2
            send "AT_OPSYS=0^m"
            print "Setting GPRS only mode"

       If you saved the above script as GPRS you would call it like this:

            <u>comgt</u> <u>GPRS</u>

       If you needed to specify the port as well then do this:

            <u>comgt</u> <u>-d</u> <u>/dev/ttyS1</u> <u>GPRS</u>

       You can also pass environment parameters to a <b>comgt</b> script via <u>$env().</u>

   <b>Replacing</b> <b>chat</b>
       <b>chat</b>  is  a  utility  that comes with the ppp package (for Linux, anyway) that, with a set of expect-send
       string couples, does enough to connect most people to ISPs and such.  While chat´s use is very simple, it
       isn´t very flexible.  That´s where <b>comgt</b> takes over.

       <b>comgt</b> can be used in place of <b>chat</b> using the same strategy.  For example, a pppd line reading:

            pppd connect \
                 ´chat -v "" ATDT5551212 CONNECT "" ogin: ppp \
                 word: whitewater´ \
                 /dev/cua1 38400 debug crtscts modem defaultroute

       Would, using <b>comgt,</b> read:

            pppd connect ´comgt -s /root/scripts/isp.scr´ /dev/cua1 38400 \
                 debug crtscts modem defaultroute

       And the isp.scr script would read:

            send "ATDT5551212^m"
            waitfor 60 "ogin:"
            send "ppp^m"
            waitfor 60 "word:"
            send "whitewater^m"

       Of course it then becomes trivial to make this script a whole lot more functional by adding code for busy
       detect, re-dialing, etc...

   <b>Verbose</b> <b>output</b>
       When the verbose option is turned on, <b>comgt</b> reports everthing on the standard error channel.   If  turned
       on from the command line (-v), the output contains 4 sections.

       - Command line argument actions
         These  are  actions  taken  because  they  were  specified  from  the  command  line, such as opening a
         communication device (-d), etc...  For these to be output, you must specify -v as the first argument.

       - List of arguments
         The number and list of arguments passed. This is useful  in  case  you  have  a  bunch  of  environment
         variables  or  quotes, back-quotes, backslashes on the command line and you´re not sure what the script
         really sees.

       - Script list
         A list of the script to execute.  This may be a concatenation of the default  internal  script,  unless
         this  is suppressed by the -s option, and a script file.  Every line is listed with its line number and
         character position.

       - Execution output
         List of commands as they are executed. The parser prints the line its currently on, starting  from  the
         exact  point  where  its  at  to  the end of the line. Multiple command groups on a single line produce
         multiple output lines. Verbose output may be mixed with script output (print, eprint or lprint.)

       Here´s an example:

         $ comgt -v -d/dev/cua1 -s blah.scr
         comgt 00:18:46 -&gt; Verbose output enabled
         comgt 00:18:46 -&gt; Script file: blah.scr
         comgt 00:18:46 -&gt; argc:5
         comgt 00:18:46 -&gt; argv[0]=comgt
         comgt 00:18:46 -&gt; argv[1]=-v
         comgt 00:18:46 -&gt; argv[2]=-d/dev/cua1
         comgt 00:18:46 -&gt; argv[3]=-s
         comgt 00:18:46 -&gt; argv[4]=blah.scr
         comgt 00:18:46 -&gt;  ---Script---
            1@0000 set com 38400n81 let a=2
            2@0025 print "9x",a,"=",9*a,"\n"
            3@0051 sleep 5
            4@0059 exit 0
         comgt 00:18:46 -&gt;  ---End of script---
         comgt 00:18:46 -&gt; @0000 set com 38400n81 let a=2
         comgt 00:18:46 -&gt; @0017 let a=2
         comgt 00:18:46 -&gt; @0025 print "9x",a,"=",9*a,"\n"
         9x2=18
         comgt 00:18:46 -&gt; @0051 sleep 5
         comgt 00:18:51 -&gt; @0059 exit 0

</pre><h4><b>Programming</b> <b>manual</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Syntax</b>
       The syntax used for <b>comgt</b> scripts is rather simple, somewhat BASIC-like.  A script  is  a  non-tokenized,
       pure  ASCII  text file containing lines terminated by newline characters (Unix standard.)  Scripts can be
       created and/or modified using any standard text editor (vi, vim, joe, pico, emacs, ed, microEmacs)  Lines
       in a <b>comgt</b> script read like so:

        - Empty line
        - [indent]rem remark
        - [indent][[:|label] LABEL] [command [arguments]] rem remark
        - [indent][[:|label] LABEL] [command [arguments]] [command [arguments]]...

       Characters used for indentation are the space and tabulation characters.
       The rem command makes the script parser skip the rest of the line.
       The rem command can also be written as "#" or "//".

       Labels consist of lowercase and uppercase letters and digits.
       Case is ignored in labels.

       Commands and their arguments are separated by spaces and/or tabs.
       Command groups are separated by spaces, tabs, or newlines.

       Expressions must not contain spaces or tabs.
       This is ok : let n=x+76
       This is not: let n= x + 76
         Because this space ^ would terminate the let command group.

   <b>Error</b> <b>reporting</b>
       When  <b>comgt</b>  detects a script error, it immediately turns on verbose mode, generates a dump (see the dump
       command), reports the error in three lines and stops the execution.   The  first  line  reported  is  the
       command  group  being  executed, the second one shows where the parser got and the third line reports the
       character position of the program counter, the error and the exit code.

       Here´s an example:

            $ comgt -vs blar2.scr

       Where the blar2.scr script is:

            inc n
            dec d3
            let a=58/3
            let $d="fod"
            let c=1/0
            let $y4="sdfgsdfgsdfg"

       The trace and error report looks like this:

            comgt 11:20:15 -&gt; Verbose output enabled
            comgt 11:20:15 -&gt; Script file: blar2.scr
            comgt 11:20:15 -&gt; argc:3
            comgt 11:20:15 -&gt; argv[0]=comgt
            comgt 11:20:15 -&gt; argv[1]=-vs
            comgt 11:20:15 -&gt; argv[2]=blar2.scr
            comgt 11:20:15 -&gt;  ---Script---
               1@0000 inc n
               2@0007 dec d3
               3@0015 let a=58/3
               4@0027 let $d="fod"
               5@0041 let c=1/0
               6@0052 let $y4="sdfgsdfgsdfg"
            comgt 11:20:15 -&gt;  ---End of script---
            comgt 11:20:15 -&gt; @0000 inc n
            comgt 11:20:15 -&gt; @0007 dec d3
            comgt 11:20:15 -&gt; @0015 let a=58/3
            comgt 11:20:15 -&gt; @0027 let $d="fod"
            comgt 11:20:15 -&gt; @0041 let c=1/0
            comgt 11:20:15 -&gt; -- Error Report --
            comgt 11:20:15 -&gt; ----&gt;         ^
            comgt 11:20:15 -&gt; Error @49, line 5, Division by zero. (6)

   <b>Exit</b> <b>codes</b>
       When <b>comgt</b> terminates, it does so with an "exit code".  That is a  number  passed  back  to  the  calling
       process  to  signify  success or failures.  In every-day Unix, 0 (zero) means success and everything else
       means whatever the author of the program wants it to mean.  In a shell script, or directly on the command
       line, you may look at the content of <u>$?</u>  after having called <b>comgt</b> to examine its exit code.

       Example:

            #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
            comgt /root/bin/call-isp
            if [ $? != 0 ]; then
              echo "Oops! Something went wrong."
            fi

       Internal <b>comgt</b> error codes are as follows:

            0 : No problems whatsoever.  Apparently.
            1 : Communication device problems.
            2 : Console (tty) device problems.
            3 : Memory problems.
            4 : File or pipe problems.
            5 : Syntax errors.
            6 : Division by zero.
            7 : Variable mis-management.
            8 : System problems.  (Couldn´t call <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> or some such)

       Daniel.Chouinard &lt;<a href="mailto:Daniel.Chouinard@pwc.utc.com">Daniel.Chouinard@pwc.utc.com</a>&gt; wrote the original <b>dcon</b> utility.

       Paul  Hardwick  &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@peck.org.uk">paul@peck.org.uk</a>&gt;  updated  it  for  the  latest compilers, provided the built-in script
       functionality and tested it against GPRS and 3G datacards.

       Martin Gregorie &lt;<a href="mailto:martin@gregorie.org">martin@gregorie.org</a>&gt; wrote the original manpage for <b>comgt</b> from  the  <b>dcon</b>  documentation
       and packaged <b>comgt</b> for distribution.

   <b>History</b>
       Daniel  Chouinard  wrote  most  (90%)  of  <b>dcon</b> back in 1989 when he started doing Unix Apps tech support
       mostly by modem to customer systems.  He was tired of typing all those passwords and funny  call-charging
       codes  everytime  he  used cu.  Also, the company he worked for needed a system that would log call times
       and estimated costs.  Thus <b>dcon</b> was born.  Six or seven years later (1996)  and  he  was  using  pppd  to
       connect  to  his  ISP  site.   He  was  more or less happy with <b>chat</b> but found it lacked flow control and
       multiple response checks from "atdt...".  He wanted it to do different things for "no carrier", "no  dial
       tone",  and  "busy".   Although  he  thought  that <b>chat</b> would probably be enhanced someday, when he found
       dcon.c on one of his old 45M tapes he tried compiling it on his Linux box and, lo and behold, it did.  In
       the end, he added a few things to it (kill, fork, wait, 1/100 sec. times) and left it at that.

       A couple of years ago Paul Hardwick found the program, <b>dcon</b> <b>0.97,</b> last modified in 1996. The  purpose  of
       this  program  was  to  run  scripts  that  would control Linux serial ports. The implementation was very
       similar to something he had written for Windows. Anyway, rather than reinvent he  contacted  the  author,
       Daniel Chouinard, and asked his permission to reuse the code.  Happily he gave permission and a basic but
       useful  utility  called  <b>comgt</b>  was  created.  Paul  takes no credit for the engine, apart from making it
       compatible with todays compilers.  It is basically <b>dcon</b> repackaged.
