       <b>--all</b>  The  opposite of `onlyChanged`. If `onlyChanged` is set by default, running jest with `--all` will
              force  Jest  to  run  all  tests  instead  of  running  only  tests  related  to  changed   files.
              [boolean]

       <b>--automock</b>
              Automock all files by default.     [boolean]

       <b>--cache</b>
              Whether to use the transform cache. Disable the cache using <b>--no-cache</b>.        [boolean]

       <b>--cacheDirectory</b>

              [boolean]

       <b>--changedSince</b>
              Runs tests related to the changes since the provided branch. If the current  branch  has  diverged

              `--onlyChanged`.       [string]

       <b>--ci</b>   Whether to run Jest in continuous integration (CI) mode. This option is  on  by  default  in  most

       <b>--color</b>
              Forces test results output color highlighting (even if stdout is not a TTY).  Set to false if  you

              [boolean]

       <b>--forceExit</b>
              Force Jest to exit after all tests have completed running. This is useful when resources set up by
              test code cannot be adequately cleaned up.             [boolean]

       <b>--globalSetup</b>
              The path to a module that runs before All Tests.                              [string]

       <b>--runTestsByPath</b>
