</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DVDISASTER</b> provides a margin of safety against data loss on optical media caused by  scratches  or  aging
       media.  It  creates error correction data which is used to recover unreadable sectors if the disc becomes
       damaged at a later time.

</pre><h4><b>TYPICAL</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dvdisaster</b> <b>-d</b> <u>/dev/hdc</u> <b>-s</b>
              Scans the medium in drive <u>/dev/hdc</u> for errors.

       <b>dvdisaster</b> <b>-d</b> <u>/dev/hdc</u> <b>-i</b> <u>medium.iso</u> <b>-r</b>
              Reads an image from drive <u>/dev/hdc</u> into the file <u>medium.iso</u>.

       <b>dvdisaster</b> <b>-d</b> <u>/dev/hdc</u> <b>-i</b> <u>medium.iso</u> <b>--read-raw</b> <b>-r</b>
              Creates an image as described above. Each sector's integrity is verified by using its EDC and L-EC
              raw data. Only possible for CD media; otherwise the <b>--read-raw</b> option is silently ignored.

       <b>dvdisaster</b> <b>-d</b> <u>/dev/hdc</u> <b>-i</b> <u>medium.iso</u> <b>--read-attempts</b> <u>n-m</u> <b>-r</b>
              Creates an image as described above. Defective sectors are retried at least <u>n</u> times and at most  <u>m</u>
              times. Recovery of defective CD media may improve when combined with <b>--read-raw</b>.

       <b>dvdisaster</b> <b>-d</b> <u>/dev/hdc</u> <b>-i</b> <u>medium.iso</u> <b>-e</b> <u>corr.ecc</u> <b>-r</b> <b>--adaptive-read</b>
              Uses  the adaptive reading strategy to read an image from drive <u>/dev/hdc</u> into the file <u>medium.iso</u>.
              Reading will stop when enough data  has  been  gathered  to  repair  the  image  using  the  error
              correction file <u>corr.ecc</u>.

       <b>dvdisaster</b> <b>-i</b> <u>medium.iso</u> <b>-e</b> <u>corr.ecc</u> <b>-c</b>
              Creates an error correction file <u>corr.ecc</u> for the image <u>medium.iso</u>.

       <b>dvdisaster</b> <b>-i</b> <u>medium.iso</u> <b>-m</b><u>RS02</u> <b>-n</b> <u>350000</u> <b>-c</b>
              Augments  the  image  <u>medium.iso</u> with error correction information, expanding the image to no more
              than <u>350000</u> sectors. If <b>-n</b> is omitted the image will be expanded to the smallest  possible  medium
              size (CD, DVD, DVD9).  Note the missing blank between <b>-m</b> and <u>RS02</u>.

       <b>dvdisaster</b> <b>-i</b> <u>medium.iso</u> <b>-e</b> <u>corr.ecc</u> <b>-f</b>
              Repairs the image file <u>medium.iso</u> using the error correction file <u>corr.ecc</u>.

       <b>dvdisaster</b> <b>-i</b> <u>medium.iso</u> <b>-e</b> <u>corr.ecc</u> <b>-t</b>
              Verifies the image <u>medium.iso</u> with information from the error correction file <u>corr.ecc</u>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>  Omit the <b>-e</b> <b>corr.ecc</b> options when working with augmented images in the examples above.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Action selection (at least one action must be specified):

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--read</b>
              Read the medium image to hard disc. Use -rn-m to read a certain sector range, e.g. -r100-200.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--create</b>
              Create .ecc information for the medium image.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--fix</b>
              Try to fix medium image using .ecc information.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--scan</b>
              Scan the medium for read errors.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--test,</b> <b>-tq,</b> <b>--test=q</b>
              Test  integrity  of  the  .iso  and  .ecc files. When the "q" option is given, only information is
              output which can be gathered without fully scanning the files.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--unlink</b>
              Delete .iso files (when other actions complete).

       Drive and file specification:

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--device</b> <b>device</b>
              read from given device (default: /dev/cdrom).

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--prefix</b> <b>prefix</b>
              prefix of .iso/.ecc file (default: medium.* ).

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--image</b> <b>imagefile</b>
              name of image file (default: medium.iso).

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--ecc</b> <b>eccfile</b>
              name of parity file (default: medium.ecc).

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--ecc-target</b> <b>file|image</b>
              Specifies whether RS03 should create error correction files or augmented images (default: image).

       Tweaking options (see manual before using!):

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--assume</b> <b>method1,method2,...</b>
              Assumes that the image is augmented with one of the given methods.   This  enables  an  exhaustive
              search  for  method  signatures and might be helpful for detecting error correction information on
              damaged media. If the image does  not  contain  the  specified  error  correction  information,  a
              significant amount of CPU and I/O time may be wasted.
              Possible values are RS02 and RS03.

       <b>-j,</b> <b>--jump</b> <b>n</b>
              jump n sectors forward after a read error (default: 16).

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--redundancy</b> <b>n[unit]</b>
              Error correction data redundancy. Allowed values depend on the method:

              RS01- and RS03-error correction files
                     -n x  creates error correction file with x roots.
                     -n x% creates error correction file with x percent redundancy.
                     -n xm creates error correction file of approx. x MiB size.

              RS01 error correction flles additionally support:
                     -n normal - optimized codec for 14.3% redundancy/32 roots.
                     -n high   - optimized codec for 33.5% redundancy/64 roots.

              RS02 images:
                     -n CD    augments image suitable for CD media.
                     -n DVD   augments image suitable for DVD media.
                     -n DVD9  augments image suitable for DVD9 media.
                     -n BD    augments image suitable for BD media.
                     -n BD2   augments image suitable for two layered BD media.
                     -n BDXL3 augments image suitable for three layered BDXL media.
                     -n x     augments image using approx. x sectors in total.
                     -n x%    augments image with approx. x% redundancy.
                     -n xr    augments image with x roots error correction data.

              RS03 images:
                     Setting  the  redundancy  is not possible due to constraints in the format.  The codec will
                     automatically choose the size of the smallest fitting medium.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--method</b> <b>n</b>
              lists/selects error correction methods (default: RS01).
              Possible values are RS01 and RS02.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b> <b>n%</b>
              more diagnostic messages

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--threads</b> <b>n</b>
              Use n threads for encoding with the RS03 method. Use 2 or 4 threads for 2  or  4  core  processors
              respectively.   On  larger machines save one core for housekeeping; e.g. use 7 threads on an eight
              core machine.

       <b>--adaptive-read</b>
              use optimized strategy for reading damaged media.

       <b>--auto-suffix</b>
              automatically add .iso and .ecc file suffixes.

       <b>--cache-size</b> <b>n</b>
              image cache size in MiB during -c mode (default: 32MiB).

       <b>--dao</b>  assume DAO disc; do not trim image end.

       <b>--defective-dump</b> <b>d</b>
              Specifies the sub directory for storing incomplete raw sectors.

       <b>--driver</b> <b>d</b> <b>(Linux</b> <b>only)</b>
              Selects between the sg (SG_IO) driver (default setting) and the  older  cdrom  (CDROM_SEND_PACKET)
              driver for accessing the optical drives.  Both drivers should work equally well; however the cdrom
              driver is known to cause system failures on some ancient SCSI controllers.  The older cdrom driver
              was  the  default up to and including dvdisaster 0.72.x; if the now pre-selected sg driver changes
              something to the worse for you please switch back to the older driver using --driver=cdrom.

       <b>--eject</b>
              eject medium after successful read.

       <b>--encoding-algorithm</b> <b>[32bit|64bit|SSE2|AltiVec]</b>
              This option affects the speed of generating RS03 error correction data.  dvdisaster can either use
              a generic encoding algorithm using 32bit or 64bit wide operations running on the integer  unit  of
              the processor, or use processor specific extensions.
              Available  extensions  are  SSE2 for x86 based processors and AltiVec on PowerPC processors. These
              extensions encode with 128bit wide operations  and  will  usually  provide  the  fastest  encoding
              variant. The SSE2/AltiVec algorithms will automatically be selected if the processor supports them
              and nothing else is specified by this option.

       <b>--encoding-io-strategy</b> <b>[readwrite|mmap]</b>
              This  option  controls  how  dvdisaster performs its disk I/O while creating error correction data
              with RS03. Try both options and see which performs best on your hardware setting.
              The "readwrite" option activates dvdisaster's own I/O scheduler which reads and writes image  data
              using  normal  file  I/O. The advantage of this scheme is that dvdisaster knows exactly which data
              needs to be cached and preloaded; the disadvantage is that all data needs to be copied between the
              kernel and dvdisaster's own buffers. Usually, this I/O scheme works best on slow storage with high
              latency and seek times; e.g. on all storage involving spinning platters.  The "mmap"  option  uses
              the  kernel's memory mapping scheme for direct access to the image file. This has the advantage of
              minimal overhead, but may be adversely affected by poor caching and preloading decisions  made  by
              the  kernel  (since  the  kernel does not know what dvdisaster is going to do with the data). This
              scheme performs well when encoding in a RAM-based file system (such as <a href="file:/dev/shm">/dev/shm</a> on Linux)  and  on
              very fast media with low latency such as SSDs.

       <b>--fill-unreadable</b> <b>n</b>
              fill unreadable sectors with byte n. Useful for processing images which have been created by other
              tools.  For  example,  ddrescue fills unreadable sectors with zeros; therefore --fill-unreadable=0
              should be used. Please note: Sparse files can not be processed with dvdisaster.

       <b>--ignore-fatal-sense</b>
              continue reading after potentially fatal error condition.

       <b>--ignore-iso-size</b>
              By default getting the image size from the ISO/UDF filesystem is preferred over querying the drive
              as most drives report unreliable values.
              However in some rare cases the image size recorded in the ISO/UDF filesystem is wrong. Some  Linux
              live  CDs may have this problem.  If you read back the ISO image from such CDs and its md5sum does
              not match the advertised one, try re-reading the image with this option turned on.
              Do not blindly turn this option on as it will most likely create  sub  optimal  or  corrupted  ISO
              images, especially if you plan to use the image for error correction data generation.

       <b>--internal-rereads</b> <b>n</b>
              internal read attempts for defective CD media sectors (default: -1)
              The drive firmware usually retries unreadable sectors a few times before giving up and returning a
              read  error.  It  is  more  efficient  to  set this to 0 or 1 and manage read attempts through the
              --read-attempts parameter. Most drives ignore this setting anyways. Use -1 to leave the  drive  at
              its default setting.

       <b>--medium-info</b>
              Prints information about the currently inserted medium.

       <b>--no-progress</b>
              Suppresses the progress percentage indicator.

       <b>--old-ds-marker</b>
              Marks missing sectors in a manner which is compatible with dvdisaster 0.70 or older.
              The  default  marking method is recommended for dvdisaster 0.72 and later versions. However images
              marked with the current method can not be processed with  older  dvdisaster  versions  as  missing
              sectors would not be recognized in the image.

              Do not process the same image with different settings for this option.

       <b>--prefetch-sectors</b> <b>n</b>
              number of sectors to preload during RS03 de-/encoding (default: 32)
              Using a value of n uses approx. n MiB of RAM.

       <b>--raw-mode</b> <b>n</b>
              selects raw reading mode for CD media (default: 20)
              The  recommended mode is 20, which makes the drive apply its built-in error correction to the best
              possible extent before transferring a  defective  sector.   However  some  drives  can  only  read
              defective  sectors  using  mode  21,  skipping the last stage of the internal error correction and
              returning the uncorrected sector instead.

       <b>--read-attempts</b> <b>n-m</b>
              attempts n up to m reads of a defective sector.

       <b>--read-medium</b> <b>n</b>
              read the whole medium up to n times.

       <b>--read-raw</b>
              performs read in raw mode if possible.

       <b>--regtest</b>
              modifies some outputs for better processing with the regression test scripts.

       <b>--resource-file</b> <b>n</b>
              Specifies the path to the configuration file (default: $HOME/.dvdisaster)

       <b>--speed-warning</b> <b>n</b>
              print warning if speed changes by more than n percent.

       <b>--spinup-delay</b> <b>n</b>
              wait n seconds for drive to spin up.

       <b>--version</b>
              print version number and some configuration information.
