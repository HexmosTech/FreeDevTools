</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ci - check in RCS revisions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ci</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>file</u> ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ci</b>  stores  new  revisions  into  RCS files.  Each file name matching an RCS suffix is taken to be an RCS
       file.  All others are assumed to be working files containing new revisions.  <b>ci</b> deposits the contents  of
       each working file into the corresponding RCS file.  If only a working file is given, <b>ci</b> tries to find the
       corresponding  RCS  file  in  an  RCS  subdirectory  and  then in the working file's directory.  For more
       details, see FILE NAMING below.

       For <b>ci</b> to work, the caller's login must be on the access list, except if the access list is empty or  the
       caller  is  the  superuser or the owner of the file.  To append a new revision to an existing branch, the
       tip revision on that branch must be locked by the caller.  Otherwise, only a new branch can  be  created.
       This restriction is not enforced for the owner of the file if non-strict locking is used (see <b><a href="../man1/rcs.1.html">rcs</a></b>(1)).  A
       lock held by someone else can be broken with the <b>rcs</b> command.

       Unless  the <b>-f</b> option is given, <b>ci</b> checks whether the revision to be deposited differs from the preceding
       one.  If not, instead of creating a new revision <b>ci</b> reverts to the preceding one.  To revert, ordinary <b>ci</b>
       removes the working file and any lock; <b>ci</b> <b>-l</b> keeps and  <b>ci</b> <b>-u</b>  removes  any  lock,  and  then  they  both
       generate  a  new working file much as if <b>co</b> <b>-l</b> or <b>co</b> <b>-u</b> had been applied to the preceding revision.  When
       reverting, any <b>-n</b> and <b>-s</b> options apply to the preceding revision.

       For each revision deposited, <b>ci</b> prompts for a log message.  The log message should summarize  the  change
       and  must be terminated by end-of-file or by a line containing <b>.</b> by itself.  If several files are checked
       in <b>ci</b> asks whether to reuse the previous log message.  If the  standard  input  is  not  a  terminal,  <b>ci</b>
       suppresses the prompt and uses the same log message for all files.  See also <b>-m</b>.

       If  the  RCS  file  does  not  exist,  <b>ci</b> creates it and deposits the contents of the working file as the
       initial revision (default number: <b>1.1</b>).  The access list is initialized to empty.   Instead  of  the  log
       message, <b>ci</b> requests descriptive text (see <b>-t</b> below).

       The  number  <u>rev</u> of the deposited revision can be given by any of the options <b>-f</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>-I</b>, <b>-j</b>, <b>-k</b>, <b>-l</b>, <b>-M</b>,
       <b>-q</b>, <b>-r</b>, or <b>-u</b>.  <u>rev</u> can be symbolic, numeric, or mixed.  Symbolic names in <u>rev</u> must already  be  defined;
       see  the  <b>-n</b>  and <b>-N</b> options for assigning names during checkin.  If <u>rev</u> is <b>$</b>, <b>ci</b> determines the revision
       number from keyword values in the working file.

       If <u>rev</u> begins with a period, then the default branch (normally the trunk) is prepended to it.  If <u>rev</u>  is
       a branch number followed by a period, then the latest revision on that branch is used.

       If <u>rev</u> is a revision number, it must be higher than the latest one on the branch to which <u>rev</u> belongs, or
       must start a new branch.

       If <u>rev</u> is a branch rather than a revision number, the new revision is appended to that branch.  The level
       number  is  obtained  by  incrementing  the  tip revision number of that branch.  If <u>rev</u> indicates a non-
       existing branch, that branch is created with the initial revision numbered <u>rev</u><b>.1</b>.

       If <u>rev</u> is omitted, <b>ci</b> tries to derive the new revision number from the caller's last lock.  If the caller
       has locked the tip revision of a branch, the new revision is appended to that branch.  The  new  revision
       number  is  obtained by incrementing the tip revision number.  If the caller locked a non-tip revision, a
       new branch is started at that revision by incrementing the highest branch number at that  revision.   The
       default initial branch and level numbers are <b>1</b>.

       If  <u>rev</u>  is  omitted and the caller has no lock, but owns the file and locking is not set to <u>strict</u>, then
       the revision is appended to the default branch (normally the trunk; see the <b>-b</b> option of <b><a href="../man1/rcs.1.html">rcs</a></b>(1)).

       Exception: On the trunk, revisions can be appended to the end, but not inserted.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-r</b><u>rev</u>  Check in revision <u>rev</u>.

       <b>-r</b>     The bare <b>-r</b> option (without any revision) has an unusual meaning in <b>ci</b>.  With other RCS  commands,
              a  bare <b>-r</b> option specifies the most recent revision on the default branch, but with <b>ci</b>, a bare <b>-r</b>
              option reestablishes the default behavior of releasing a lock and removing the working  file,  and
              is used to override any default <b>-l</b> or <b>-u</b> options established by shell aliases or scripts.

       <b>-l</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              works  like  <b>-r</b>,  except  it  performs  an additional <b>co</b> <b>-l</b> for the deposited revision.  Thus, the
              deposited revision is immediately checked out again and locked.   This  is  useful  for  saving  a
              revision although one wants to continue editing it after the checkin.

       <b>-u</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              works  like  <b>-l</b>, except that the deposited revision is not locked.  This lets one read the working
              file immediately after checkin.

              The <b>-l</b>, bare <b>-r</b>, and <b>-u</b> options are mutually exclusive and  silently  override  each  other.   For
              example, <b>ci</b> <b>-u</b> <b>-r</b> is equivalent to <b>ci</b> <b>-r</b> because bare <b>-r</b> overrides <b>-u</b>.

       <b>-f</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              forces a deposit; the new revision is deposited even it is not different from the preceding one.

       <b>-k</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              searches  the  working  file  for  keyword values to determine its revision number, creation date,
              state, and author (see <b><a href="../man1/co.1.html">co</a></b>(1)), and assigns these values to the  deposited  revision,  rather  than
              computing  them locally.  It also generates a default login message noting the login of the caller
              and the actual checkin date.  This option is useful for software distribution.  A revision that is
              sent to several sites should be checked in with the <b>-k</b> option  at  these  sites  to  preserve  the
              original  number,  date,  author,  and  state.   The  extracted keyword values and the default log
              message can be overridden with the options <b>-d</b>, <b>-m</b>, <b>-s</b>, <b>-w</b>, and any option that carries a  revision
              number.

       <b>-q</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              quiet mode; diagnostic output is not printed.  A revision that is not different from the preceding
              one is not deposited, unless <b>-f</b> is given.

       <b>-i</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              initial  checkin;  report an error if the RCS file already exists.  This avoids race conditions in
              certain applications.

       <b>-j</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              just checkin and do not initialize; report an error if the RCS file does not already exist.

       <b>-I</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              interactive mode; the user is prompted and  questioned  even  if  the  standard  input  is  not  a
              terminal.

       <b>-d</b>[<u>date</u>]
              uses  <u>date</u>  for  the  checkin date and time.  The <u>date</u> is specified in free format as explained in
              <b><a href="../man1/co.1.html">co</a></b>(1).  This is useful for lying about the checkin date, and for <b>-k</b> if no date is  available.   If
              <u>date</u> is empty, the working file's time of last modification is used.

       <b>-M</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              Set  the  modification time on any new working file to be the date of the retrieved revision.  For
              example, <b>ci</b> <b>-d</b> <b>-M</b> <b>-u</b> <u>f</u> does not alter <u>f</u>'s modification time, even if <u>f</u>'s contents  change  due  to
              keyword substitution.  Use this option with care; it can confuse <b><a href="../man1/make.1.html">make</a></b>(1).

       <b>-m</b>[<u>msg</u><b>]</b>
              uses  the  string  <u>msg</u>  as  the  log  message for all revisions checked in.  If <u>msg</u> is omitted, it
              defaults to "*** empty log message ***".  By convention,  log  messages  that  start  with  <b>#</b>  are
              comments  and  are ignored by programs like GNU Emacs's <b>vc</b> package.  Also, log messages that start
              with <b>{</b><u>clumpname</u><b>}</b> (followed by white space) are meant to be clumped together if possible,  even  if
              they  are associated with different files; the <b>{</b><u>clumpname</u><b>}</b> label is used only for clumping, and is
              not considered to be part of the log message itself.

       <b>-n</b><u>name</u> assigns the symbolic name <u>name</u> to the number of the  checked-in  revision.   <b>ci</b>  prints  an  error
              message if <u>name</u> is already assigned to another number.

       <b>-N</b><u>name</u> same as <b>-n</b>, except that it overrides a previous assignment of <u>name</u>.

       <b>-s</b><u>state</u>
              sets the state of the checked-in revision to the identifier <u>state</u>.  The default state is <b>Exp</b>.

       <b>-t</b><u>file</u> writes  descriptive  text  from  the  contents  of  the named <u>file</u> into the RCS file, deleting the
              existing text.  The <u>file</u> cannot begin with <b>-</b>.

       <b>-t-</b><u>string</u>
              Write descriptive text from the <u>string</u> into the RCS file, deleting the existing text.

              The <b>-t</b> option, in both its forms, has effect only  during  an  initial  checkin;  it  is  silently
              ignored otherwise.

              During  the  initial  checkin,  if  <b>-t</b>  is  not  given,  <b>ci</b>  obtains the text from standard input,
              terminated by end-of-file or by a line containing <b>.</b> by itself.  The user is prompted for the  text
              if interaction is possible; see <b>-I</b>.

              For backward compatibility with older versions of RCS, a bare <b>-t</b> option is ignored.

       <b>-T</b>     Set  the RCS file's modification time to the new revision's time if the former precedes the latter
              and there is a new revision; preserve the RCS file's modification time  otherwise.   If  you  have
              locked  a  revision,  <b>ci</b>  usually  updates  the  RCS file's modification time to the current time,
              because the lock is stored in the RCS file and removing the lock requires changing the  RCS  file.
              This  can  create  an  RCS  file  newer than the working file in one of two ways: first, <b>ci</b> <b>-M</b> can
              create a working file with a date before the current time; second, when reverting to the  previous
              revision  the  RCS  file can change while the working file remains unchanged.  These two cases can
              cause excessive recompilation caused by a <b><a href="../man1/make.1.html">make</a></b>(1) dependency of the working file on the RCS  file.
              The  <b>-T</b>  option  inhibits  this recompilation by lying about the RCS file's date.  Use this option
              with care; it can suppress recompilation even when a checkin of one  working  file  should  affect
              another  working file associated with the same RCS file.  For example, suppose the RCS file's time
              is 01:00, the (changed) working file's time is 02:00, some other copy of the working  file  has  a
              time  of  03:00,  and  the current time is 04:00.  Then <b>ci</b> <b>-d</b> <b>-T</b> sets the RCS file's time to 02:00
              instead of the usual 04:00; this causes <b><a href="../man1/make.1.html">make</a></b>(1) to think (incorrectly)  that  the  other  copy  is
              newer than the RCS file.

       <b>-w</b><u>login</u>
              uses <u>login</u> for the author field of the deposited revision.  Useful for lying about the author, and
              for <b>-k</b> if no author is available.

       <b>-V</b>     Print RCS's version number.

       <b>-V</b><u>n</u>    Emulate RCS version <u>n</u>.  See <b><a href="../man1/co.1.html">co</a></b>(1) for details.

       <b>-x</b><u>suffixes</u>
              specifies  the  suffixes  for  RCS  files.   A nonempty suffix matches any file name ending in the
              suffix.  An empty suffix matches any file name of the form <b>RCS/</b><u>frag</u> or  <u>frag1</u><b>/RCS/</b><u>frag2.</u>   The  <b>-x</b>
              option  can specify a list of suffixes separated by <b>/</b>.  For example, <b>-x,v/</b> specifies two suffixes:
              <b>,v</b> and the empty suffix.  If two or more suffixes are specified, they  are  tried  in  order  when
              looking  for an RCS file; the first one that works is used for that file.  If no RCS file is found
              but an RCS file can be created, the suffixes are tried in order to determine the  new  RCS  file's
              name.   The default for <u>suffixes</u> is installation-dependent; normally it is <b>,v/</b> for hosts like Unix
              that permit commas in file names, and is empty (i.e. just the empty suffix) for other hosts.

       <b>-z</b><u>zone</u> specifies the date output format in keyword substitution, and specifies the default time zone  for
              <u>date</u>  in the <b>-d</b><u>date</u> option.  The <u>zone</u> should be empty, a numeric UTC offset, or the special string
              <b>LT</b> for local time.  The default is an empty <u>zone</u>, which uses the traditional  RCS  format  of  UTC
              without  any  time  zone  indication and with slashes separating the parts of the date; otherwise,
              times are output in ISO 8601 format with time zone indication.  For  example,  if  local  time  is
              January  11,  1990, 8pm Pacific Standard Time, eight hours west of UTC, then the time is output as
              follows:

                     <u>option</u>    <u>time</u> <u>output</u>
                     <b>-z</b>        <b>1990/01/12</b> <b>04:00:00</b>        <u>(default)</u>
                     <b>-zLT</b>      <b>1990-01-11</b> <b>20:00:00-08</b>
                     <b>-z+05:30</b>  <b>1990-01-12</b> <b>09:30:00+05:30</b>

              The <b>-z</b> option does not affect dates stored in RCS files, which are always UTC.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>NAMING</b></h4><pre>
       Pairs of RCS files and working files can be specified in three ways (see also the example section).

       1) Both the RCS file and the working file are given.  The RCS file name is of  the  form  <u>frag1</u><b>/</b><u>workfileX</u>
       and  the  working file name is of the form <u>frag2</u><b>/</b><u>workfile</u> where <u>frag1</u><b>/</b> and <u>frag2</u><b>/</b> are (possibly different
       or empty) file names, <u>workfile</u> is a file name, and <u>X</u> is an RCS suffix.  If <u>X</u> is empty, <u>frag1</u><b>/</b> must  start
       with <b>RCS/</b> or must contain <b>/RCS/</b>.

       2) Only the RCS file is given.  Then the working file is created in the current directory and its name is
       derived from the RCS file name by removing <u>frag1</u><b>/</b> and the suffix <u>X</u>.

       3)  Only the working file is given.  Then <b>ci</b> considers each RCS suffix <u>X</u> in turn, looking for an RCS file
       of the form <u>frag2</u><b>/RCS/</b><u>workfileX</u> or (if the former is not found and <u>X</u> is nonempty) <u>frag2</u><b>/</b><u>workfileX.</u>

       If the RCS file is specified without a file name in 1) and 2), <b>ci</b> looks for the RCS  file  first  in  the
       directory <b>./RCS</b> and then in the current directory.

       <b>ci</b> reports an error if an attempt to open an RCS file fails for an unusual reason, even if the RCS file's
       name  is  just one of several possibilities.  For example, to suppress use of RCS commands in a directory
       <u>d</u>, create a regular file named <u>d</u><b>/RCS</b> so that casual attempts to use RCS commands in <u>d</u> fail because  <u>d</u><b>/RCS</b>
       is not a directory.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Suppose  <b>,v</b>  is  an  RCS  suffix  and  the current directory contains a subdirectory <b>RCS</b> with an RCS file
       <b>io.c,v</b>.  Then each of the following commands check in a copy  of  <b>io.c</b>  into  <b>RCS/io.c,v</b>  as  the  latest
       revision, removing <b>io.c</b>.

              <b>ci</b>  <b>io.c;</b>    <b>ci</b>  <b>RCS/io.c,v;</b>   <b>ci</b>  <b>io.c,v;</b>
              <b>ci</b>  <b>io.c</b>  <b>RCS/io.c,v;</b>    <b>ci</b>  <b>io.c</b>  <b>io.c,v;</b>
              <b>ci</b>  <b>RCS/io.c,v</b>  <b>io.c;</b>    <b>ci</b>  <b>io.c,v</b>  <b>io.c;</b>

       Suppose  instead that the empty suffix is an RCS suffix and the current directory contains a subdirectory
       <b>RCS</b> with an RCS file <b>io.c</b>.  The each of the following commands checks in a new revision.

              <b>ci</b>  <b>io.c;</b>    <b>ci</b>  <b>RCS/io.c;</b>
              <b>ci</b>  <b>io.c</b>  <b>RCS/io.c;</b>
              <b>ci</b>  <b>RCS/io.c</b>  <b>io.c;</b>

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       An RCS file created by <b>ci</b> inherits the read and execute permissions from the working file.   If  the  RCS
       file  exists  already,  <b>ci</b>  preserves  its  read  and execute permissions.  <b>ci</b> always turns off all write
       permissions of RCS files.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Temporary files are created in the directory containing the working  file,  and  also  in  the  temporary
       directory  (see  <b>TMPDIR</b>  under  <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>).   A  semaphore  file  or files are created in the directory
       containing the RCS file.  With a nonempty suffix, the semaphore names begin with the first  character  of
       the  suffix;  therefore,  do  not specify an suffix whose first character could be that of a working file
       name.  With an empty suffix, the semaphore names end with <b>_</b> so working file names should not end in <b>_</b>.

       <b>ci</b> never changes an RCS file or working file.  Normally, <b>ci</b> unlinks the file and creates a new  one;  but
       instead of breaking a chain of one or more symbolic links to an RCS file, it unlinks the destination file
       instead.   Therefore, <b>ci</b> breaks any hard or symbolic links to any working file it changes; and hard links
       to RCS files are ineffective, but symbolic links to RCS files are preserved.

       The effective user must be able to search and write the directory containing the RCS file.  Normally, the
       real user must be able to read the RCS and working files and to search and write the directory containing
       the working file; however, some older hosts cannot easily switch between real and effective users, so  on
       these hosts the effective user is used for all accesses.  The effective user is the same as the real user
       unless  your  copies  of  <b>ci</b>  and  <b>co</b>  have  setuid  privileges.  As described in the next section, these
       privileges yield extra security if the effective user owns all RCS files and directories, and if only the
       effective user can write RCS directories.

       Users can control access to RCS files by setting the permissions of the directory containing  the  files;
       only users with write access to the directory can use RCS commands to change its RCS files.  For example,
       in  hosts  that allow a user to belong to several groups, one can make a group's RCS directories writable
       to that group only.  This approach suffices for informal projects, but it means that any group member can
       arbitrarily change the group's RCS files, and can even remove them entirely.  Hence more formal  projects
       sometimes  distinguish  between  an  RCS  administrator,  who can change the RCS files at will, and other
       project members, who can check in new revisions but cannot otherwise change the RCS files.

</pre><h4><b>SETUID</b> <b>USE</b></h4><pre>
       To prevent anybody but their RCS administrator from deleting revisions, a set of users can employ  setuid
       privileges as follows.

       • Check that the host supports RCS setuid use.  Consult a trustworthy expert if there are any doubts.  It
         is  best if the <b>seteuid</b> system call works as described in Posix 1003.1a Draft 5, because RCS can switch
         back and forth easily between real and effective users, even if the real user is  <b>root</b>.   If  not,  the
         second  best  is  if  the  <b>setuid</b> system call supports saved setuid (the {_POSIX_SAVED_IDS} behavior of
         Posix 1003.1-1990); this fails only if the real or effective user is <b>root</b>.  If RCS detects any  failure
         in setuid, it quits immediately.

       • Choose  a user <u>A</u> to serve as RCS administrator for the set of users.  Only <u>A</u> can invoke the <b>rcs</b> command
         on the users' RCS files.  <u>A</u> should not be <b>root</b>  or  any  other  user  with  special  powers.   Mutually
         suspicious sets of users should use different administrators.

       • Choose a file name <u>B</u> to be a directory of files to be executed by the users.

       • Have  <u>A</u> set up <u>B</u> to contain copies of <b>ci</b> and <b>co</b> that are setuid to <u>A</u> by copying the commands from their
         standard installation directory <u>D</u> as follows:

              <b>mkdir</b>  <u>B</u>
              <b>cp</b>  <u>D</u><b>/c[io]</b>  <u>B</u>
              <b>chmod</b>  <b>go-w,u+s</b>  <u>B</u><b>/c[io]</b>

       • Have each user prepend <u>B</u> to their command search path as follows:

              <b>PATH=</b><u>B</u><b>:$PATH;</b>  <b>export</b>  <b>PATH</b>  # ordinary shell
              <b>set</b>  <b>path=(</b><u>B</u>  <b>$path)</b>  # C shell

       • Have <u>A</u> create each RCS directory <u>R</u> with write access only to <u>A</u> as follows:

              <b>mkdir</b>  <u>R</u>
              <b>chmod</b>  <b>go-w</b>  <u>R</u>

       • If you want to let only certain users read the RCS files, put the users into a  group  <u>G</u>,  and  have  <u>A</u>
         further protect the RCS directory as follows:

              <b>chgrp</b>  <u>G</u>  <u>R</u>
              <b>chmod</b>  <b>g-w,o-rwx</b>  <u>R</u>

       • Have <u>A</u> copy old RCS files (if any) into <u>R</u>, to ensure that <u>A</u> owns them.

       • An  RCS  file's  access  list  limits  who can check in and lock revisions.  The default access list is
         empty, which grants checkin access to anyone who can read the RCS file.   If  you  want  limit  checkin
         access,  have <u>A</u> invoke <b>rcs</b> <b>-a</b> on the file; see <b><a href="../man1/rcs.1.html">rcs</a></b>(1).  In particular, <b>rcs</b> <b>-e</b> <b>-a</b><u>A</u> limits access to just
         <u>A</u>.

       • Have <u>A</u> initialize any new RCS files with <b>rcs</b> <b>-i</b> before initial checkin, adding the  <b>-a</b>  option  if  you
         want to limit checkin access.

       • Give setuid privileges only to <b>ci</b>, <b>co</b>, and <b>rcsclean</b>; do not give them to <b>rcs</b> or to any other command.

       • Do not use other setuid commands to invoke RCS commands; setuid is trickier than you think!

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>RCSINIT</b>
              Options prepended to the argument list, separated by spaces.  A backslash escapes spaces within an
              option.   The  <b>RCSINIT</b>  options  are prepended to the argument lists of most RCS commands.  Useful
              <b>RCSINIT</b> options include <b>-q</b>, <b>-V</b>, <b>-x</b>, and <b>-z</b>.

       <b>RCS_MEM_LIMIT</b>
              Normally, for speed, commands either memory map or copy into memory the RCS file if  its  size  is
              less  than  the  <u>memory-limit</u>,  currently  defaulting  to  ``unlimited''.   Otherwise  (or  if the
              initially-tried speedy ways fail), the commands fall back to using standard i/o routines.  You can
              adjust the memory limit by setting <b>RCS_MEM_LIMIT</b> to a numeric value <u>lim</u> (measured  in  kilobytes).
              An empty value is silently ignored.  As a side effect, specifying <b>RCS_MEM_LIMIT</b> inhibits fall-back
              to slower routines.

       <b>TMPDIR</b> Name of the temporary directory.  If not set, the environment variables <b>TMP</b> and <b>TEMP</b> are inspected
              instead  and  the first value found is taken; if none of them are set, a host-dependent default is
              used, typically <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b>.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       For each revision, <b>ci</b> prints the RCS file, the working file, and the number of both the deposited and the
       preceding revision.  The exit status is zero if and only if all operations were successful.

       The full documentation for RCS is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the <b><a href="../man1/info.1.html">info</a></b>(1) and  RCS  programs  are
       properly installed at your site, the command

              <b>info</b> <b>rcs</b>

       should give you access to the complete manual.  Additionally, the RCS homepage:

              <b><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/">http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/</a></b>

       has news and links to the latest release, development site, etc.
