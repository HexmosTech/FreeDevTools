</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cvsmgdiff - uses mgdiff to display differences between any two cvs revisions.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cvsmgdiff</b> [<b>-v</b>⎪<b>-h</b>⎪<b>-g</b> <u>gui</u>⎪<b>-r</b> <u>rev1</u> [<b>-r</b> <u>rev2</u>]] <u>file</u> ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page documents briefly  the cvsmgdiff program.  This manual page was written for the Debian
       GNU/Linux distribution (but may be used by others), because the  original program does not have a  manual
       page.

       This  script lets you recursively diff the CVS directories you have checked out.  To use, just pass in an
       optional revision levels and an optional file directory  name.   This  script  then  will  show  you  the
       differences you're interested in.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v</b>  Print version information successfully

       <b>-h</b>  Print help information

       <b>-g</b> <u>gui</u>
           Use the program <u>gui</u> as the user interface (default: <u>/usr/bin/mgdiff</u>)

       <b>-r</b> <u>revision</u>
           Specify  the  CVS  revision  to  view.  If just one <b>-r</b> option is given, view differences between that
           revision and the current file in the CVS working directory.  If two <b>-r</b>  options  are  given,  compare
           those two revisions with each other.
