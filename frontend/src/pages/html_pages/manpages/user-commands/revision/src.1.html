</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       src - simple revision control

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>src</b> [command] [revision-spec] [<u>file</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       SRC (or src) is simple revision control, a version-control system for single-file projects by solo
       developers and authors. It modernizes the venerable RCS, hence the anagrammatic acronym. The design is
       tuned for use cases like all those little scripts in your <u><a href="file:~/bin">~/bin</a></u> directory, or a directory full of
       single-file HOWTOs.

       SRC revision histories are single, human-readable files beneath a hidden <u>.src</u> subdirectory in the
       directory where they live. There may be multiple histories under one directory; SRC treats them as
       separate projects, and history files can be moved elsewhere at any time.

       SRC gives you simple, consecutive integer revision numbers. It supports tags and branching. It records
       commit timestamps, but does not show committer information, because the committer is always you. The
       command set is intended to look familiar if you have ever used Subversion, Mercurial, or Git.

       SRC is lightweight and fast. It uses two small self-contained executables, with no libraries and no
       complications.

       SRC interprets the EDITOR variable in the usual way, using it to spawn an editor instance when you
       perform a commit or amend. If EDITOR is not set it has a fallback list of editors it looks for, beginning
       with various ways to invoke Emacs and vi.

       SRC is fully supported in Emacs VC mode.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>SUMMARY</b></h4><pre>
       A "revision" is a 1-origin integer, or a tag name designating an integer revision, or a branch name
       designating the tip revision of its branch. Revision numbers always increase in commit-date order.

       A revision range is a single revision, or a pair of revisions "M-N" (all revisions numerically from M to
       N) or "M..N" (all revisions that are branch ancestors of N and branch successors of M).

       If SRC complains that your revision spec looks like a nonexistent filename, you can prefix it with "@"
       (this is always allowed). "@" by itself means the current (checked-out) revision.

       A filename can be a path. In that case SRC will behave as though it were running in the lowest-level
       directory on the path and called with the path basename.

       Unless otherwise noted under individual commands, the default revision is the tip revision on the current
       branch and the default range is all revisions on the current branch.

       The token "--" tells the command-line interpreter that subcommands, switches, and revision-specs are done
       - everything after it is a filename, even if it looks like a subcommand or revision number.

       src help [<u>command</u>]
           Displays help for commands.

       src commit [-|-m <u>string</u>|-f <u>file</u>|-e|-b branch] [<u>file</u>...]
           Enters a commit for specified files. Separately to each one. A history is created for the file if it
           does not already exist. With <u>-</u>, take comment text from stdin; with <u>-m</u> use the following string as the
           comment; with <u>-f</u> take from a file. With <u>-e</u>, edit even after <u>-</u>, <u>-f</u> or <u>-m</u>. "ci" is a synonym for
           "commit". With <u>-b</u>, set ther named branch to check in to (it must exist); that branch becomes the
           default for commits.

       src amend [-|-m <u>string</u>|-f <u>file</u>|-e] [<u>revision</u>] [<u>file</u>...]
           Amends the stored comment for a specified revision, defaulting to the latest revision on the current
           branch. Flags are as for commit. "am" is a synonym for "amend".

       src checkout [<u>revision</u>] [<u>file</u>...]
           Refresh the working copy of the file(s) from their history files. "co" is a synonym for "checkout".

       src cat [<u>revision</u>] [<u>file</u>...]
           Send the specified revision of the files to standard output.

       src status [-a] [<u>file</u>...]
           "A" = added, "=" = unmodified, "M" = modified, "!" = missing, "?" = not tracked, "I" = ignored, "L" =
           locked (recover with "src checkout"). The "A" and "L" statuses should only occur if you have used RCS
           directly on a file. Normally "?" and "I" files are not listed; this changes if you either give the <u>-a</u>
           switch or specify which files to look at. "st" is a synonym for "status".

       src tag [list|-l|create|-c|delete|del|-d] [<u>name</u>] [<u>revision</u>] [<u>file</u>...]
           List tags, create tags, or delete tags. Create/delete takes a revision, defaulting to the current
           branch tip. List defaults to all revisions.

       src branch [list|-l|create|-c|delete|del|-d] [<u>name</u>] [<u>file</u>...]
           List, create, or delete branches. When listing, the active branch is first in the list. The default
           branch is "trunk". Create/delete takes a singleton revision, defaulting to the current branch tip; on
           create, the branch becomes default for future commits. List defaults to all revisions, including 0
           (the trunk root phantom revision).

       src rename [<u>tag</u>|<u>branch</u>] [<u>oldname</u>] [<u>newname</u>] [<u>file</u>...]
           Rename a tag or branch. Refuses to step on an existing symbol or rename a nonexistent one. "rn" is a
           synonym for "rename".

       src list [(-&lt;n&gt;|-l &lt;n&gt;)] [-f <u>fmt</u>] [<u>revision-range</u>] [<u>file</u>...]
           Sends summary information about the specified commits to standard output. The summary line tagged
           with "*" is the state that the file would return to on checkout without a revision-spec. See <u>help</u>
           <u>list</u> for information about custom formats. Use <u>-&lt;n&gt;</u> or <u>-l</u> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>, where &lt;n&gt; is a number, to limit the
           listing length. Default range is the current branch, reversed. "li" is a synonym for "list".

       src log [-v] [(-&lt;n&gt;|-l &lt;n&gt;)] [(-p|-u|-c) [-b|-w]] [<u>revision-range</u>] [<u>file</u>...]
           Sends log information about the specified commits to standard output. Use <u>-&lt;n&gt;</u> or <u>-l</u> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>, where &lt;n&gt;
           is a number, to limit the listing length. Default range is the current branch, reversed. The <u>--patch</u>,
           <u>-p</u> or <u>-u</u> option additionally sends a unified-format diff listing to standard output for each revision
           against its immediate ancestor revision; <u>-c</u> emits a context diff instead. When generating a diff, <u>-b</u>
           ignores changes in whitespace, and <u>-w</u> ignores all whitespace. Histories imported via <u>fast-import</u>
           (when not using its <u>-p</u> option) have RFC-822-style headers inserted into the log comment to preserve
           metadata not otherwise representable in SRC, such as distinct author and committer identifications
           and dates. These headers are normally suppressed by <u>log</u>, however, <u>-v</u> shows a summarized view of
           important headers; <u>-v</u> <u>-v</u> shows all headers as-is.

       src diff [(-u|-c) [-b|-w]] [<u>revision-range</u>] [<u>file</u>...]
           Sends a diff listing to standard output. With no revision spec, diffs the working copy against the
           last version checked in. With one revno, diffs the working copy against that stored revision; with a
           range, diff between the beginning and end of the range. The actual difference generation is done with
           <a href="../man1/diff.1.html">diff</a>(1). The default diff format is <u>-u</u> (unified), but if you specify a <u>-c</u> option after the verb a
           context diff will be emitted.  <u>-b</u> ignores changes in the amount of whitespace, and <u>-w</u> ignores all
           whitespace. "di" is a synonym for "diff".

       src ls
           List all registered files.

       src visualize
           Emit a DOT visualization of repository structures. To use this, install the graphviz package and pipe
           the output to something like "dot -Tpng | display -". "vis" is a synonym for "visualize".

       src move <u>old</u> <u>new</u>
           Rename a workfile and its history. Refuses to step on existing workfiles or histories. "mv" is a
           synonym for "move".

       src copy <u>old</u> <u>new</u>
           Copy a file and its master. Refuses to step on existing files or masters. "cp" is a synonym for
           "copy".

       src fast-export [<u>revision-range</u>] [<u>file</u>...]
           Export one or more projects as a Git fast-import stream. For a history originally imported from
           elsewhere, author and committer identification is gleaned from the RFC-822-style headers inserted
           into the commit comment by <u>fast-import</u> (if its <u>-p</u> option was not used). Otherwise, this information
           is copied from your Git configuration.

       src fast-import [-p] [<u>files</u>...]
           Parse a git-fast-import stream from standard input. The modifications for each individual file become
           separate SRC histories. Mark, committer and author data, and mark cross-references to parent commits,
           are preserved in RFC-822-style headers on log comments unless the <u>-p</u> (plain) option is given, in
           which case this metadata is discarded. Give arguments to restrict the files imported.

       src release [<u>file</u>...]
           Release locks on files. This is never necessary in a normal workflow, which will be repeated
           edit-commit cycles, but it may be handy if you have to interoperate with other tools that expect RCS
           masters to be in their normal (unlocked) state.

       src srcify
           Move a directory from being RCS- or SCCS-managed to being SRC-managed. That is: if the current
           directory contains an RCS directory, rename it to .src (but leave any SCCS directory in place). Then
           check out all masters for editing that are not already checked out.

       src version
           Report the versions of SRC, the underlying Python, and the RCS or SCCS back end.

       The omission of "src remove" is a deliberate speed bump.

       If no files are specified, all eligible files are operated on in sequence.

</pre><h4><b>NOISE</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       Silence is golden. When you have selected only one file to operate on, and the command is not a report
       generator (<u>status</u>, <u>cat</u>, <u>log</u>, <u>list</u>, <u>fast-export</u>, the listing modes of <u>tag</u> and <u>branch</u>, <u>ls</u>) you will see a
       reply only if the operation failed.

       Other commands (<u>commit</u>, <u>checkout</u>, tag creation and deletion) give you a success message per file when
       operating on multiple files, so you will not be in doubt about which operation succeeded. This behavior
       can be suppressed with the <u>-q</u> option, placed <u>before</u> the subcommand word.

       If your directory contains a file named ".srcignore", each line that is neither blank nor begins with a
       "#" is interpreted as an ignore pattern. It is expanded with <a href="../man3/glob.3.html">glob</a>(3), and files in the expansion are
       omitted from <u>src</u> <u>status</u> - unless the file is named as an argument, of the status command, in which case
       its status is "I". Thus, for example, a line reading "*.html" will cause all files with an HTML extension
       to be omitted from the output of "src status", but the output of <u>src</u> <u>status</u> <u>*</u> will list them with status
       "I".

</pre><h4><b>BACKWARD</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       SRC history files are (normally) RCS master files. SRC maintains no permanent state other than these
       files.

       In order to maintain complete backwards compatibility, one other compromise was made: any commit comment
       containing a string exactly matching an RCS log delimiter (a long string of "-" characters) will be
       rejected as malformed.

       The RCS back end will be automatically selected when there is an <u>.src</u> or <u>RCS</u> subdirectory. If both these
       directories exist, SRC will operate on <u>.src</u> and preserve the RCS directory; in this case it will be a
       little extra verbose to leave no doubt about what it is doing.

       You can explicitly select the RCS back end by making the first command keyword on the src command line be
       <u>rcs</u>. This should only be necessary when your working directory contains two or more of the subdirectories
       <u>.src</u>, <u>RCS</u>, and <u>SCCS</u>.

       If your directory has both a <u>.src</u> and an unrelated <u>RCS</u> directory you can force SRC to work on the RCS
       directory and ignore <u>.src</u> by giving it the option "-S RCS".

       By default, history files are kept in a hidden subdirectory named <u>.src</u>. But if you have an <u>RCS</u>
       subdirectory and no <u>.src</u>, SRC will quietly operate on the files in the <u>RCS</u> directory in a completely
       backward-compatible way.

</pre><h4><b>WORKING</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>SCCS</b></h4><pre>
       Using SCCS as a back end is also supported, with some limits due to missing features in SCCS
       implementations:

       •   SCCS tags are an SRC-only extension that won’t be visible from SCCS running natively.

       •   All commands relating to tags and branches throw an error in the SCCS back end.

       •   In CSSC SCCS, src cat does not necessarily pipe out binary data correctly. This has been fixed in the
           SunOS and Schilling versions.

       •   The CSSC SCCS, the exec bit is not propagated between master and workfile. This has been fixed in the
           SunOS and Schilling versions.

       •   The CSSC and SunOS SCCS backends have a Y2.1K problem that SRC cannot effectively work around and
           will probably not be fixed. The Schilling version has repaired this. To be on the safe side, do not
           use the SCCS backend after the year 2067.

       The SCCS back end will be automatically selected when there is an <u>SCCS</u> subdirectory and no <u>.src</u> or <u>RCS</u>
       subdirectory.

       You can explicitly select the SCCS back end by making the first command keyword on the src command line
       be <u>sccs</u>. This should only be necessary when your working directory contains none or two or more of the
       subdirectories <u>.src</u>, <u>RCS</u>, and <u>SCCS</u>.

       Working with SCCS requires an <u>SCCS</u> subdirectory; SRC will quietly create one, if required, then operate
       on the files in the <u>SCCS</u> directory in a completely backward-compatible way.

       Fast-import to SCCS is not supported.

       The SCCS mode is not recommended unless you have a specific need to work with legacy SCCS repositories.
       Up-converting them to something less Paleolithic (e.g. with <a href="../man1/sccs2rcs.1.html">sccs2rcs</a>(1) or <a href="../man1/reposurgeon.1.html">reposurgeon</a>(1)) would be a
       better idea; in truth, the SCCS support exists mainly because it’s hilarious (for obscure hacker values
       of <u>hilarious</u>).

</pre><h4><b>DEBUGGING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These will be of interest mainly to developers. They must go before the subcommand.

       A <u>-d</u> (debug) option before the main command word turns on debugging messages. Just one "-d" gives you
       complete visibility about what commands the back end is running. It can be repeated for higher debugging
       levels that expose more of src’s internal computation.

       A <u>-L</u> option sets a log file to which debug output dould be written Without this option it is written to
       standard error.

       A <u>-S</u> (sandbox) option can be used to set the repository directory to something other than its default of
       <u>.src</u>. Use "-S RCS" to make src operate on an <u>RCS</u> directory even if there is alraady a <u>.src</u> directory.

       A <u>-T</u> option sets up an artificial clock that ticks once on each revision and fixes the user information
       to be used in <u>fast-export</u>; It also attributes all commits to "J. Random Hacker". It is for regression
       testing.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       SRC is written in Python and requires 2.7 or later; it will run under Python 3.x for x &gt; 2.

       If you wish to use the RCS support (recommended), the RCS tools at version 5.7 or later must be installed
       and accessible in your $PATH.

       If you wish to use the SCCS support, some implementation of SCCS must be accessible. GNU’s CSSC
       (Compatibly Stupid Source Control) will work; so will the SunOS and Schilling forks of AT&amp;T SCCS.

       The <a href="../man1/rcs-fast-import.1.html">rcs-fast-import</a>(1) tool at version 1.3 or later is required to support the <u>src</u> <u>fast-import</u> command.

       SRC will die gracefully with a useful error message when it fails due to a missing back end.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       SRC will unconditionally bail out if a directory named <u>RCS-save</u> exists. This is because in order to be
       able to use <u>.src</u> when an unrelated <u>RCS</u> subdirectory is also present, SRC has to play a game of
       three-directory monte. Before doing its work it moves <u>RCS</u> to <u>RCS-save</u>, then moves <u>.src</u> to <u>RCS</u>; after
       doing its work it moves <u>RCS</u> to <u>.src</u> and <u>RCS-save</u> to <u>RCS</u>. If there is a pre-existing <u>RCS-save</u> this
       maneuver can’t be done. If you trip over such a pre-exiting <u>RCS-save</u>, this probanly means SRC previously
       underwent a hard crash and you will have to resuffle these directories by hand. No bug that can produce
       duch a crash has yet been reported.

       The directory shuffle also means that running more than one SRC edit session on the same directory at the
       same time may produce mysterious failures. Don’t do this - it is way outside the tool’s intended
       performance envelope.

       Branch deletions change the revision numbers of revisions downstream of the branch join.

       In src fast-export dumps of repositories with tags, branch labels may not exactly match what git
       fast-export would emit.

       In both RCS and SCCS revision numbers normally looked like "1.n" for n starting at 1 and monotonically
       increasing. It was possible to check in a change with a higher release number (for example, "2.1"),
       though this was seldom done. If you use SRC to view or edit an ancient master that used this feature,
       commands using ranges and named branches will not always work as exoected.
