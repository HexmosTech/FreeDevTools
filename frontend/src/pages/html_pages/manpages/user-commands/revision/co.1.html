</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       co - check out RCS revisions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>co</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>file</u> ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>co</b> retrieves a revision from each RCS file and stores it into the corresponding working file.

       Filenames  matching an RCS suffix denote RCS files; all others denote working files.  Names are paired as
       explained in <b><a href="../man1/ci.1.html">ci</a></b>(1).

       Revisions of an RCS file can be checked out locked or unlocked.  Locking a revision prevents  overlapping
       updates.   A  revision  checked  out  for  reading or processing (e.g., compiling) need not be locked.  A
       revision checked out for editing and later checkin must normally be locked.  Checkout with locking  fails
       if  the  revision  to  be  checked  out  is currently locked by another user.  (A lock can be broken with
       <b><a href="../man1/rcs.1.html">rcs</a></b>(1).)  Checkout with locking also requires the caller to be on the access list of the RCS file, unless
       he is the owner of the file or the superuser, or the access list is empty.  Checkout without  locking  is
       not subject to accesslist restrictions, and is not affected by the presence of locks.

       A  revision  is  selected  by options for revision or branch number, checkin date/time, author, or state.
       When the selection options are applied in combination, <b>co</b> retrieves the latest  revision  that  satisfies
       all  of  them.   If  none  of the selection options is specified, <b>co</b> retrieves the latest revision on the
       default branch (normally the trunk, see the <b>-b</b> option of <b><a href="../man1/rcs.1.html">rcs</a></b>(1)).  A revision or  branch  number  can  be
       attached to any of the options <b>-f</b>, <b>-I</b>, <b>-l</b>, <b>-M</b>, <b>-p</b>, <b>-q</b>, <b>-r</b>, or <b>-u</b>.  The options <b>-d</b> (date), <b>-s</b> (state), and
       <b>-w</b>  (author)  retrieve from a single branch, the <u>selected</u> branch, which is either specified by one of <b>-f</b>,
       ..., <b>-u</b>, or the default branch.

       A <b>co</b> command applied to an RCS file with no revisions creates a  zero-length  working  file.   <b>co</b>  always
       performs keyword substitution (see below).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-r</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              retrieves  the  latest  revision  whose  number  is less than or equal to <u>rev</u>.  If <u>rev</u> indicates a
              branch rather than a revision, the latest revision  on  that  branch  is  retrieved.   If  <u>rev</u>  is
              omitted, the latest revision on the default branch (see the <b>-b</b> option of <b><a href="../man1/rcs.1.html">rcs</a></b>(1)) is retrieved.  If
              <u>rev</u> is <b>$</b>, <b>co</b> determines the revision number from keyword values in the working file.  Otherwise, a
              revision  is  composed  of  one  or  more numeric or symbolic fields separated by periods.  If <u>rev</u>
              begins with a period, then the default branch (normally the trunk) is prepended to it.  If <u>rev</u>  is
              a  branch  number  followed  by  a  period,  then the latest revision on that branch is used.  The
              numeric equivalent of a symbolic field is specified with the <b>-n</b> option of the commands  <b><a href="../man1/ci.1.html">ci</a></b>(1)  and
              <b><a href="../man1/rcs.1.html">rcs</a></b>(1).

       <b>-l</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              same as <b>-r</b>, except that it also locks the retrieved revision for the caller.

       <b>-u</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              same  as <b>-r</b>, except that it unlocks the retrieved revision if it was locked by the caller.  If <u>rev</u>
              is omitted, <b>-u</b> retrieves the revision locked by  the  caller,  if  there  is  one;  otherwise,  it
              retrieves the latest revision on the default branch.

       <b>-f</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              forces  the  overwriting  of  the working file; useful in connection with <b>-q</b>.  See also FILE MODES
              below.

       <b>-kkv</b>   Generate keyword strings using the default  form,  e.g.  <b>$Revision:</b>  <b>5.10.1</b>  <b>$</b>  for  the  <b>Revision</b>
              keyword.   A  locker's name is inserted in the value of the <b>Header</b>, <b>Id</b>, and <b>Locker</b> keyword strings
              only as a file is being locked, i.e. by <b>ci</b> <b>-l</b> and <b>co</b> <b>-l</b>.  This is the default.

       <b>-kkvl</b>  Like <b>-kkv</b>, except that a locker's name is always inserted  if  the  given  revision  is  currently
              locked.

       <b>-kk</b>    Generate  only  keyword  names  in  keyword  strings; omit their values.  See KEYWORD SUBSTITUTION
              below.  For example,  for  the  <b>Revision</b>  keyword,  generate  the  string  <b>$Revision$</b>  instead  of
              <b>$Revision:</b> <b>5.10.1</b> <b>$</b>.  This option is useful to ignore differences due to keyword substitution when
              comparing  different  revisions of a file.  Log messages are inserted after <b>$Log$</b> keywords even if
              <b>-kk</b> is specified, since this tends to be more useful when merging changes.

       <b>-ko</b>    Generate the old keyword string, present in the working file just before it was checked  in.   For
              example,  for  the  <b>Revision</b>  keyword,  generate the string <b>$Revision:</b> <b>1.1</b> <b>$</b> instead of <b>$Revision:</b>
              <b>5.10.1</b> <b>$</b> if that is how the string appeared when the file was checked in.  This can be useful  for
              file  formats  that  cannot  tolerate  any  changes  to substrings that happen to take the form of
              keyword strings.

       <b>-kb</b>    Generate a binary image of the old keyword string.  This acts like <b>-ko</b>,  except  it  performs  all
              working  file  input  and  output  in binary mode.  This makes little difference on Posix and Unix
              hosts, but on DOS-like hosts one should use <b>rcs</b> <b>-i</b> <b>-kb</b> to initialize an RCS file  intended  to  be
              used  for  binary files.  Also, on all hosts, <b><a href="../man1/rcsmerge.1.html">rcsmerge</a></b>(1) normally refuses to merge files when <b>-kb</b>
              is in effect.

       <b>-kv</b>    Generate only keyword values for keyword strings.  For example, for the <b>Revision</b> keyword, generate
              the string <b>5.10.1</b> instead of <b>$Revision:</b> <b>5.10.1</b> <b>$</b>.  This can help  generate  files  in  programming
              languages  where it is hard to strip keyword delimiters like <b>$Revision:</b> <b>$</b> from a string.  However,
              further keyword substitution cannot be performed once the  keyword  names  are  removed,  so  this
              option should be used with care.  Because of this danger of losing keywords, this option cannot be
              combined  with  <b>-l</b>,  and the owner write permission of the working file is turned off; to edit the
              file later, check it out again without <b>-kv</b>.

       <b>-p</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              prints the retrieved revision on the standard output rather than storing it in the  working  file.
              This option is useful when <b>co</b> is part of a pipe.

       <b>-q</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              quiet mode; diagnostics are not printed.

       <b>-I</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              interactive  mode;  the  user  is  prompted  and  questioned  even  if the standard input is not a
              terminal.

       <b>-d</b><u>date</u> retrieves the latest revision on the selected branch whose checkin date/time is less than or equal
              to <u>date</u>.  The date and time can be given in free format.  The time zone <b>LT</b> stands for local  time;
              other  common  time zone names are understood.  For example, the following <u>date</u>s are equivalent if
              local time is January 11, 1990, 8pm  Pacific  Standard  Time,  eight  hours  west  of  Coordinated
              Universal Time (UTC):

                     <b>8:00</b> <b>pm</b> <b>lt</b>
                     <b>4:00</b> <b>AM,</b> <b>Jan.</b> <b>12,</b> <b>1990</b>           default is UTC
                     <b>1990-01-12</b> <b>04:00:00+00</b>           ISO 8601 (UTC)
                     <b>1990-01-11</b> <b>20:00:00-08</b>           ISO 8601 (local time)

                     <b>Thu</b> <b>Jan</b> <b>11</b> <b>20:00:00</b> <b>PST</b> <b>1990</b>     output of <b><a href="../man1/date.1.html">date</a></b>(1)
                     <b>Fri</b> <b>Jan</b> <b>12</b> <b>04:00:00</b> <b>GMT</b> <b>1990</b>
                     <b>Thu,</b> <b>11</b> <b>Jan</b> <b>1990</b> <b>20:00:00</b> <b>-0800</b>  Internet RFC 822
                     <b>12-January-1990,</b> <b>04:00</b> <b>WET</b>

              Most  fields  in  the  date and time can be defaulted.  The default time zone is normally UTC, but
              this can be overridden by the <b>-z</b> option.  The other defaults are determined  in  the  order  year,
              month,  day,  hour,  minute, and second (most to least significant).  At least one of these fields
              must be provided.  For omitted fields that are of higher significance than  the  highest  provided
              field,  the  time  zone's  current  values  are assumed.  For all other omitted fields, the lowest
              possible values are assumed.  For example, without <b>-z</b>, the date <b>20,</b> <b>10:30</b> defaults to 10:30:00 UTC
              of the 20th of the UTC time zone's current month and year.  The date/time must  be  quoted  if  it
              contains spaces.

       <b>-M</b>[<u>rev</u>]
              Set  the  modification time on the new working file to be the date of the retrieved revision.  Use
              this option with care; it can confuse <b><a href="../man1/make.1.html">make</a></b>(1).

       <b>-s</b><u>state</u>
              retrieves the latest revision on the selected branch whose state is set to <u>state</u>.

       <b>-S</b>     Enable <u>self-same</u> mode.  In this mode, the owner of a lock is unimportant,  just  that  it  exists.
              Effectively, this means the user cannot check out the same revision twice.

       <b>-T</b>     Preserve  the  modification  time  on  the RCS file even if the RCS file changes because a lock is
              added or removed.  This option can suppress extensive recompilation caused by a <b><a href="../man1/make.1.html">make</a></b>(1) dependency
              of some other copy of the working file on the RCS  file.   Use  this  option  with  care;  it  can
              suppress recompilation even when it is needed, i.e. when the change of lock would mean a change to
              keyword strings in the other working file.

       <b>-w</b>[<u>login</u>]
              retrieves  the  latest revision on the selected branch which was checked in by the user with login
              name <u>login</u>.  If the argument <u>login</u> is omitted, the caller's login is assumed.

       <b>-j</b><u>joinlist</u>
              generates a new revision which is the join of the revisions on <u>joinlist</u>.  This option  is  largely
              obsoleted by <b><a href="../man1/rcsmerge.1.html">rcsmerge</a></b>(1) but is retained for backwards compatibility.

              The  <u>joinlist</u>  is  a  comma-separated list of pairs of the form <u>rev2</u><b>:</b><u>rev3,</u> where <u>rev2</u> and <u>rev3</u> are
              (symbolic or numeric) revision numbers.  For the initial such  pair,  <u>rev1</u>  denotes  the  revision
              selected  by  the  above  options  <b>-f</b>,  ...,  <b>-w</b>.   For all other pairs, <u>rev1</u> denotes the revision
              generated by the previous pair.  (Thus, the output of one join becomes the input to the next.)

              For each pair, <b>co</b> joins revisions <u>rev1</u> and <u>rev3</u> with respect to <u>rev2</u>.  This means that all changes
              that transform <u>rev2</u> into <u>rev1</u> are applied to a copy of <u>rev3</u>.  This is particularly useful if  <u>rev1</u>
              and  <u>rev3</u>  are the ends of two branches that have <u>rev2</u> as a common ancestor.  If <u>rev1</u>&lt;<u>rev2</u>&lt;<u>rev3</u> on
              the same branch, joining generates a new revision which is like <u>rev3,</u> but with  all  changes  that
              lead  from  <u>rev1</u>  to  <u>rev2</u> undone.  If changes from <u>rev2</u> to <u>rev1</u> overlap with changes from <u>rev2</u> to
              <u>rev3,</u> <b>co</b> reports overlaps as described in <b><a href="../man1/merge.1.html">merge</a></b>(1).

              For the initial pair, <u>rev2</u> can be omitted.  The default is the common ancestor.   If  any  of  the
              arguments  indicate  branches, the latest revisions on those branches are assumed.  The options <b>-l</b>
              and <b>-u</b> lock or unlock <u>rev1</u>.

       <b>-V</b>     Print RCS's version number.

       <b>-V</b><u>n</u>    Emulate RCS version <u>n,</u> where <u>n</u> can be <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, or <b>5</b>.  This can be useful when interchanging RCS files
              with others  who  are  running  older  versions  of  RCS.   To  see  which  version  of  RCS  your
              correspondents are running, have them invoke <b>rcs</b> <b>-V</b>; this works with newer versions of RCS.  If it
              doesn't  work,  have  them  invoke  <b>rlog</b>  on an RCS file; if none of the first few lines of output
              contain the string <b>branch:</b> it is version 3; if the dates'  years  have  just  two  digits,  it  is
              version  4; otherwise, it is version 5.  An RCS file generated while emulating version 3 loses its
              default branch.  An RCS revision generated while emulating version 4 or earlier has a  time  stamp
              that is off by up to 13 hours.  A revision extracted while emulating version 4 or earlier contains
              abbreviated  dates  of  the  form  <u>yy</u><b>/</b><u>mm</u><b>/</b><u>dd</u>  and  can  also contain different white space and line
              prefixes in the substitution for <b>$Log$</b>.

       <b>-x</b><u>suffixes</u>
              Use <u>suffixes</u> to characterize RCS files.  See <b><a href="../man1/ci.1.html">ci</a></b>(1) for details.

       <b>-z</b><u>zone</u> specifies the date output format in keyword substitution, and specifies the default time zone  for
              <u>date</u>  in the <b>-d</b><u>date</u> option.  The <u>zone</u> should be empty, a numeric UTC offset, or the special string
              <b>LT</b> for local time.  The default is an empty <u>zone</u>, which uses the traditional  RCS  format  of  UTC
              without  any  time  zone  indication and with slashes separating the parts of the date; otherwise,
              times are output in ISO 8601 format with time zone indication.  For  example,  if  local  time  is
              January  11,  1990, 8pm Pacific Standard Time, eight hours west of UTC, then the time is output as
              follows:

                     <u>option</u>    <u>time</u> <u>output</u>
                     <b>-z</b>        <b>1990/01/12</b> <b>04:00:00</b>        <u>(default)</u>
                     <b>-zLT</b>      <b>1990-01-11</b> <b>20:00:00-08</b>
                     <b>-z+05:30</b>  <b>1990-01-12</b> <b>09:30:00+05:30</b>

              The <b>-z</b> option does not affect dates stored in RCS files, which are always UTC.

</pre><h4><b>KEYWORD</b> <b>SUBSTITUTION</b></h4><pre>
       Strings of the form <b>$</b><u>keyword</u><b>$</b> and <b>$</b><u>keyword</u><b>:</b><u>...</u><b>$</b> embedded in the text are replaced  with  strings  of  the
       form <b>$</b><u>keyword</u><b>:</b><u>value</u><b>$</b> where <u>keyword</u> and <u>value</u> are pairs listed below.  Keywords can be embedded in literal
       strings or comments to identify a revision.

       Initially,  the  user  enters strings of the form <b>$</b><u>keyword</u><b>$</b><u>.</u>  On checkout, <b>co</b> replaces these strings with
       strings of the form <b>$</b><u>keyword</u><b>:</b><u>value</u><b>$</b><u>.</u>  If a revision containing strings of the latter form is checked back
       in, the value fields  will  be  replaced  during  the  next  checkout.   Thus,  the  keyword  values  are
       automatically updated on checkout.  This automatic substitution can be modified by the <b>-k</b> options.

       Keywords and their corresponding values:

       <b>$Author$</b>
              The login name of the user who checked in the revision.

       <b>$Date$</b> The  date  and  time  the  revision  was  checked  in.   With <b>-z</b><u>zone</u> a numeric time zone offset is
              appended; otherwise, the date is UTC.

       <b>$Header$</b>
              A standard header containing the full RCS file name, the revision number, the date and  time,  the
              author, the state, and the locker (if locked).  With <b>-z</b><u>zone</u> a numeric time zone offset is appended
              to the date; otherwise, the date is UTC.

       <b>$Id$</b>   Same as <b>$Header$</b>, except that the RCS file name is without the directory components.

       <b>$Locker$</b>
              The login name of the user who locked the revision (empty if not locked).

       <b>$Log$</b>  The  log  message  supplied during checkin, preceded by a header containing the RCS file name, the
              revision number, the author, and the date and time.  With <b>-z</b><u>zone</u> a numeric  time  zone  offset  is
              appended;  otherwise,  the date is UTC.  Existing log messages are <u>not</u> replaced.  Instead, the new
              log message is inserted after <b>$Log:</b>...<b>$</b>.  This is useful for accumulating a complete change log in
              a source file.

              Each inserted line is prefixed by the string that prefixes the <b>$Log$</b> line.  For  example,  if  the
              <b>$Log$</b>  line  is “<b>//</b> <b>$Log:</b> <b>tan.cc</b> <b>$</b>”, RCS prefixes each line of the log with “<b>//</b> ”.  This is useful
              for languages with comments that go to the end of the line.  The convention for other languages is
              to use a “ <b>∗</b> ” prefix inside a multiline comment.  For example, the initial log  comment  of  a  C
              program conventionally is of the following form:

                     <b>/∗</b>
                      <b>∗</b> <b>$Log$</b>
                      <b>∗/</b>

              For  backwards  compatibility with older versions of RCS, if the log prefix is <b>/∗</b> or <b>(∗</b> surrounded
              by optional white space, inserted log lines contain a space instead of <b>/</b> or <b>(</b>; however, this usage
              is obsolescent and should not be relied on.

       <b>$Name$</b> The symbolic name used to check out  the  revision,  if  any.   For  example,  <b>co</b> <b>-rJoe</b>  generates
              <b>$Name:</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>$</b>.  Plain <b>co</b> generates just <b>$Name:</b>  <b>$</b>.

       <b>$RCSfile$</b>
              The RCS file name without directory components.

       <b>$Revision$</b>
              The revision number assigned to the revision.

       <b>$Source$</b>
              The full RCS file name.

       <b>$State$</b>
              The state assigned to the revision with the <b>-s</b> option of <b><a href="../man1/rcs.1.html">rcs</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/ci.1.html">ci</a></b>(1).

       The  following  characters  in keyword values are represented by escape sequences to keep keyword strings
       well-formed.

              <u>char</u>     <u>escape</u> <u>sequence</u>
              tab      <b>\t</b>
              newline  <b>\n</b>
              space    <b>\040</b>
              <b>$</b>        <b>\044</b>
              <b>\</b>        <b>\\</b>

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       The working file inherits the read and execute permissions from the RCS file.   In  addition,  the  owner
       write  permission  is turned on, unless <b>-kv</b> is set or the file is checked out unlocked and locking is set
       to strict (see <b><a href="../man1/rcs.1.html">rcs</a></b>(1)).

       If a file with the name of the working file exists already  and  has  write  permission,  <b>co</b>  aborts  the
       checkout,  asking  beforehand  if possible.  If the existing working file is not writable or <b>-f</b> is given,
       the working file is deleted without asking.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>co</b> accesses files much as <b><a href="../man1/ci.1.html">ci</a></b>(1) does, except that it does not need to read  the  working  file  unless  a
       revision number of <b>$</b> is specified.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>RCSINIT</b>
              Options prepended to the argument list, separated by spaces.  A backslash escapes spaces within an
              option.   The  <b>RCSINIT</b>  options  are prepended to the argument lists of most RCS commands.  Useful
              <b>RCSINIT</b> options include <b>-q</b>, <b>-V</b>, <b>-x</b>, and <b>-z</b>.

       <b>RCS_MEM_LIMIT</b>
              Normally, for speed, commands either memory map or copy into memory the RCS file if  its  size  is
              less  than  the  <u>memory-limit</u>,  currently  defaulting  to  ``unlimited''.   Otherwise  (or  if the
              initially-tried speedy ways fail), the commands fall back to using standard i/o routines.  You can
              adjust the memory limit by setting <b>RCS_MEM_LIMIT</b> to a numeric value <u>lim</u> (measured  in  kilobytes).
              An empty value is silently ignored.  As a side effect, specifying <b>RCS_MEM_LIMIT</b> inhibits fall-back
              to slower routines.

       <b>TMPDIR</b> Name of the temporary directory.  If not set, the environment variables <b>TMP</b> and <b>TEMP</b> are inspected
              instead  and  the first value found is taken; if none of them are set, a host-dependent default is
              used, typically <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b>.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The RCS file name, the working file name, and the revision number retrieved are written to the diagnostic
       output.  The exit status is zero if and only if all operations were successful.

       The full documentation for RCS is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the <b><a href="../man1/info.1.html">info</a></b>(1) and  RCS  programs  are
       properly installed at your site, the command

              <b>info</b> <b>rcs</b>

       should give you access to the complete manual.  Additionally, the RCS homepage:

              <b><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/">http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/</a></b>

       has news and links to the latest release, development site, etc.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITS</b></h4><pre>
       Links to the RCS and working files are not preserved.

       There  is  no  way to selectively suppress the expansion of keywords, except by writing them differently.
       In nroff and troff, this is done by embedding the null-character <b>\&amp;</b> into the keyword.
