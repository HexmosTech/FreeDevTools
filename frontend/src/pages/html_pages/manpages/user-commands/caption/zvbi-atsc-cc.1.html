</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       zvbi-atsc-cc - ATSC Closed Caption decoder

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>zvbi-atsc-cc</b> <b>[</b> <b>options</b> <b>]</b> <b>[-n]</b> <b>station</b> <b>name</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>zvbi-atsc-cc</b>  captures  ATSC  TV  transmissions  using a Linux DVB device and decodes the enclosed Closed
       Caption data. It can record both NTSC caption (EIA 608-B) and DTVCC caption (CEA 708-C).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-?</b> <b>-h</b> <b>--help</b> <b>--usage</b>
              Print a short usage message.

       <b>-q</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Suppress all progress and error messages.

       <b>-v</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Increase verbosity.

   <b>Device</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-a</b> number
       <b>--adapter-num</b> number
              Select a different DVB device to capture the signal (/dev/dvb/adapterN). The default is adapter 0.

       <b>-i</b> number
       <b>--frontend-id</b> number
              Select a different frontend on the DVB device  (/dev/dvb/adapterN/frontendM).  Most  devices  have
              only one frontend.  The default is frontend 0.

       <b>-d</b> number
       <b>--demux-id</b> number
              Select  a  different demultiplexer on the DVB device (/dev/dvb/adapterN/demuxM). Most devices have
              only one demultiplexer.  The default is demultiplexer 0.

       <b>-r</b> number
       <b>--dvr-id</b> number
              Select a different DVR interface on the DVB device  (/dev/dvb/adapterN/dvrM).  Most  devices  have
              only one DVR interface.  The default is DVR interface 0.

       <b>-T</b>
       <b>--ts</b>   Decode  an  MPEG-2 Transport Stream on standard input instead of opening a DVB device. This option
              is mainly intended for debugging.

              Since Transport Streams can contain multiple programs you must still specify one or  more  station
              names, which <b>zvbi-atsc-cc</b> will look up in a channel configuration file to determine the Program ID
              of the video elementary stream or streams it should extract. You should also add the <b>--atsc</b> option
              to  clarify  that  this  is an ATSC TS and the program should expect an <b>azap</b> channel configuration
              file, which is otherwise inferred from the DVB device capabilities.

   <b>Tuning</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-e</b> file name
       <b>--channel-conf</b> file name
              To tune in a TV station <b>zvbi-atsc-cc</b> needs a channel configuration file. We use the config file of
              the <b>azap</b> tuning tool from the linuxtv-dvb-apps package. You can create it with the <b>scan</b> tool  from
              the same package.

              The  azap  channel  configuration  file is a text file which lists one station per line. Each line
              contains six fields separated by a colon: The station name, the transponder frequency in  Hz,  the
              modulation  used  (8VSB,  16VSB, QAM_64, QAM_256), the video stream PID, the audio stream PID, and
              the service ID. Empty lines and lines starting with a number sign will be ignored.

              This option selects a different channel configuration file.  The default is
              <u>$HOME/.azap/channels.conf</u>

       <b>-L</b> <b>--list</b>
              List all stations in the channel configuration file and their transponder frequency.

       <b>-n</b> station name
       <b>--station</b> station name
              The station to tune in. Usually the <b>-n</b> can be omitted.

              <b>zvbi-atsc-cc</b> can record caption from multiple  stations  at  once  if  they  share  a  transponder
              frequency. Just specify multiple station names on the command line to enable this.

   <b>Caption</b> <b>options</b>
       With  the caption and XDS options you specify which data <b>zvbi-atsc-cc</b> should extract. If multiple station
       names are given these options apply to the succeeding station name. You must  specify  at  least  one  of
       these options for each station.

       <b>-c</b> <b>--cc</b>
              Print any received caption on standard output.

       <b>-C</b> file name
       <b>--cc-file</b> file name
              Append any received caption to the specified file.

       <b>-l</b> number
       <b>--channel</b> number
              Print NTSC Closed Caption channel 1, 2, 3 or 4 on standard output.

       <b>-1</b> ... <b>-4</b> file name
       <b>--cc1-file</b> ... <b>--cc4-file</b> file name
              Filter  out NTSC Closed Caption channel CC1 ... CC4 and append the text to the specified file. CC1
              is the primary, CC3 the secondary caption service. If both services are  transmitted  CC1  usually
              carries English, CC3 Spanish caption.

       <b>-5</b> ... <b>-8</b> file name
       <b>--t1-file</b> ... <b>--t4-file</b> file name
              Filter out NTSC Text service T1 ... T4 and append the text to the specified file.

       <b>-9</b> ... <b>-0</b> file name
       <b>--s1-file</b> ... <b>--s2-file</b> file name
              Filter  out  DTVCC  service  1  or  2  and append the text to the specified file. Service 1 is the
              primary, service 2 the secondary caption service. If  both  services  are  transmitted  service  1
              usually carries English, service 2 Spanish caption.

              Digital  TV  stations  are  supposed  to  transmit  language codes and other information about the
              available caption services but these are not presently evaluated.  <b>zvbi-atsc-cc</b> filters  out  text
              which does not appear to be caption, such as tickers or vertically printed text.

       <b>-b</b> <b>--no-webtv</b>
              Do not print WebTV links.

       <b>-m</b> <b>--timestamps</b>
              Prepend  timestamps  YYYYMMDDHHMMSS  to caption lines. This is the system time in the UTC timezone
              when the text was captured, specifically the  Carriage  Return  or  Pop-On  code  responsible  for
              printing the line.

       <b>-S</b> <b>--stream-time</b>
       <b>-S</b>date <b>--stream-time</b>=date
              Prepend  timestamps  YYYYMMDDHHMMSS  to caption lines generated from the timestamps transmitted in
              the video stream. If date is given, also in the format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS, it will  be  added  to  the
              timestamps, otherwise the counter starts at 0001-01-01 00:00:00.

       <b>-s</b> <b>--sentences</b>
              Print caption one sentence at a time.

       <b>-j</b> type
       <b>--format</b> type
              When  type  is  "plain"  <b>zvbi-atsc-cc</b> prints caption and XDS text without any markup. When type is
              "vt100" it faithfully reproduces the caption foreground and background color, italic and underline
              attributes by inserting VT.100 terminal control codes. With type "ntsc-cc" it mimics the output of
              the <b>ntsc-cc</b> and <b>zvbi-ntsc-cc</b> tool. The default is "ntsc-cc".

              <b>zvbi-atsc-cc</b> <b>supports</b> <b>all</b> <b>Closed</b> <b>Caption</b> <b>character</b> <b>sets</b>  <b>and</b>  converts  to  the  encoding  of  the
              current locale, usually UTF-8.

       <b>-p</b> <b>--plain</b>
              Same as <b>-j</b> <b>plain</b>

   <b>XDS</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-x</b> <b>--xds</b>
              Print all received XDS data on standard output.

       <b>-X</b> file name
       <b>--xds-file</b> file name
              Filter out eXtended Data Service data (station name, program name, program rating etc.) and append
              it as text to the specified file.

       <b>-f</b> type[,type]*
       <b>--filter</b> type[,type]*
              Filter  out  specific  XDS  information:  all,  call (station call sign), desc (program synopsis),
              length, network, rating, time, timecode, timezone, title.  Multiple  <b>-f</b>  options  accumulate.  The
              default is "all".

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       zvbi-atsc-cc -c NJN-HD

       zvbi-atsc-cc --cc1-file wnyw.txt WNYW-DT --cc1-file wwor.txt WWOR-DT

       (NJN-HD, WNYW-DT and WWOR-DT are TV stations in New York. WNYW-DT
       and WWOR-DT can be captured simultaneously because they share a
       transponder frequency.)
