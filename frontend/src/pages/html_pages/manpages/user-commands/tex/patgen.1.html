       patgen - generate patterns for TeX hyphenation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>patgen</b> <u>dictionary_file</u> <u>pattern_file</u> <u>patout_file</u> <u>translate_file</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is  not  meant  to  be  exhaustive.   See  also  the Info file or manual <u>Web2C:</u> <u>A</u> <u>TeX</u>
       <u>implementation</u> available as part of the TeX Live distribution or at <u><a href="http://tug.org/web2c">http://tug.org/web2c</a></u>.

       The <u>patgen</u> program reads the <u>dictionary_file</u> containing a list of hyphenated words and  the  <u>pattern_file</u>
       containing  previously-generated  patterns  (if any) for a particular language (not a complete TeX source
       file; see below), and produces  the  <u>patout_file</u>  with  (previously-  plus  newly-generated)  hyphenation
       patterns  for  that  language.  The  <u>translate_file</u>  defines  language specific values for the parameters
       <u>left_hyphen_min</u> and <u>right_hyphen_min</u> used by TeX's hyphenation algorithm and the external  representation
       of  the lower and upper case version(s) of all `letters' of that language. Further details of the pattern
       generation process such as hyphenation levels and pattern lengths are requested  interactively  from  the
       user's  terminal.  Optionally  <u>patgen</u>  creates  a  new  dictionary file <b>pattmp.</b><u>n</u> showing the good and bad
       hyphens found by the generated patterns, where <u>n</u> is the highest hyphenation level.

       The patterns generated by <u>patgen</u> can be read by <b>initex</b> for use in  hyphenating  words.  For  a  real-life
       example of <u>patgen</u>'s output, see <u>$TEXMFMAIN/tex/generic/hyphen/hyphen.tex</u>, which contains the patterns TeX
       uses  for  English  by default.  At some sites, patterns for (many) other languages may be available, and
       the local <b>tex</b> programs may have them preloaded.

       All filenames must be complete; no adding of default extensions or path searching is done.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Letters</b>
           When <b>initex</b> digests hyphenation patterns, TeX first expands  macros  and  the  result  must  entirely
           consist of digits (hyphenation levels), dots (`.', edge of a word), and letters. In pattern files for
           non-English  languages  letters  are often represented by macros or other expandable constructs.  For
           the purpose of <u>patgen</u> these are just character sequences, subject  to  the  condition  that  no  such
           sequence is a prefix of another one.

       <b>Dictionary</b> <b>file</b>
           A  dictionary file contains a weighted list of hyphenated words, one word per line starting in column
           1. A digit in column 1 indicates a global word weight (initially  =1)  applicable  to  all  following
           words  up  to the next global word weight. A digit at some intercharacter position indicates a weight
           for that position only.

           The hyphens in a word are indicated by `-', `*', or `.' (or their  replacements  as  defined  in  the
           translate  file)  for  hyphens yet to be found, `good' hyphens (correctly found by the patterns), and
           `bad' hyphens (erroneously found by the patterns) respectively; when reading a dictionary file `*' is
           treated like `-' and `.' is ignored.

       <b>Pattern</b> <b>file</b>
           A pattern file contains only patterns in the format above, e.g., from a previous run of  patgen.   It
           may  <u>not</u>  contain  any  TeX comments or control sequences.  For instance, this is not a valid pattern
           file:

           % this is a pattern file read by TeX.
           \patterns{%
            ...
           }
           It can only contain the actual patterns, i.e., the `...'.

       <b>Translate</b> <b>file</b>
           A translate file starts with a  line  containing  the  values  of  <u>left_hyphen_min</u>  in  columns  1-2,
           <u>right_hyphen_min</u>  in  columns  3-4,  and  either  a  blank or the replacement for one of the "hyphen"
           characters `-', `*', and `.' in columns 5, 6, and 7. (Input lines are padded with blanks as for  many
           TeX related programs.)

           Each  following  line defines one `letter': an arbitrary delimiter character in column 1, followed by
           one or more external representations of that character (first the `lower' case one used for  output),
           each one terminated by the delimiter and the whole sequence terminated by another delimiter.

           If  the  translate  file is empty, the values <u>left_hyphen_min</u>=2, <u>right_hyphen_min</u>=3, and the 26 lower
           case letters <b>a</b>...<b>z</b> with their upper case representations <b>A</b>...<b>Z</b> are assumed.

       <b>Terminal</b> <b>input</b>
           After reading the <u>translate_file</u> and any  previously-generated  patterns  from  <u>pattern_file</u>,  <u>patgen</u>
           requests input from the user's terminal.

           First  the integer values of <u>hyph_start</u> and <u>hyph_finish</u>, the lowest and highest hyphenation level for
           which patterns are to be generated. The value of <u>hyph_start</u> should be  larger  than  any  hyphenation
           level already present in <u>pattern_file</u>.

           Then,  for  each  hyphenation level, the integer values of <u>pat_start</u> and <u>pat_finish</u>, the smallest and
           largest pattern length to be analyzed, as well as <u>good</u> <u>weight</u>, <u>bad</u> <u>weight</u>, and <u>threshold</u>, the weights
           for good and bad hyphens and a weight threshold for useful patterns.

           Finally the decision (`y' or `Y' vs. anything else) whether or not to produce a hyphenated word list.

       Frank  Liang wrote the first version of this program.  Peter Breitenlohner made a substantial revision in
       1991 for TeX 3.  The first version was published as the appendix to the <u>TeXware</u> technical report.  Howard
       Trickey originally ported it to Unix.
