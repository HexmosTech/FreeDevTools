</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tex, initex - text formatting and typesetting

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tex</b> [<u>options</u>] [<b>&amp;</b><u>format</u>] [<u>file</u>|<b>\</b><u>commands</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Run the TeX typesetter on <u>file</u>, usually creating <u>file.dvi</u>.  If the file argument has no extension, ".tex"
       will  be  appended  to it.  Instead of a filename, a set of TeX commands can be given, the first of which
       must start with a backslash.  With a <b>&amp;</b><u>format</u> argument TeX uses a different set of  precompiled  commands,
       contained in <u>format</u><b>.fmt</b>; it is usually better to use the <b>-fmt</b> <u>format</u> option instead.

       TeX  formats  the  interspersed  text  and commands contained in the named files and outputs a typesetter
       independent file (called <u>DVI</u>, which is short for <u>DeVice</u> <u>Independent</u>).  TeX's  capabilities  and  language
       are  described  in  <u>The</u> <u>TeXbook</u>.  TeX is normally used with a large body of precompiled macros, and there
       are several specific formatting systems, such as LaTeX, which require the support of several macro files.

       This version of TeX looks at its command line to see what name it was called under.  If they exist,  then
       both <b>initex</b> and <b>virtex</b> are symbolic links to the <b>tex</b> executable.  When called as <b>initex</b> (or when the <b>-ini</b>
       option is given) it can be used to precompile macros into a <u>.fmt</u> file.  When called as <b>virtex</b> it will use
       the  <u>plain</u> format.  When called under any other name, TeX will use that name as the name of the format to
       use.  For example, when called as <b>tex</b> the <u>tex</u> format is used, which is identical  to  the  <u>plain</u>  format.
       The  commands  defined  by  the <u>plain</u> format are documented in <u>The</u> <u>TeXbook</u>.  Other formats that are often
       available include <u>latex</u> and <u>amstex</u>.

       The non-option command line arguments to the TeX program are passed to it as the first input line.   (But
       it  is  often easier to type extended arguments as the first input line, since UNIX shells tend to gobble
       up or misinterpret TeX's favorite symbols, like backslashes, unless you quote them.)  As described in <u>The</u>
       <u>TeXbook</u>, that first line should begin with a filename, a <u>\controlsequence</u>, or a <u>&amp;formatname</u>.

       The normal usage is to say
       tex paper
       to start processing <u>paper.tex</u>.  The name <u>paper</u> will be the ``jobname'', and is  used  in  forming  output
       filenames.   If  TeX doesn't get a filename in the first line, the jobname is <u>texput</u>.  When looking for a
       file, TeX looks for the name with and without the default extension  (<u>.tex</u>)  appended,  unless  the  name
       already  contains that extension.  If <u>paper</u> is the ``jobname'', a log of error messages, with rather more
       detail than normally appears on the screen, will appear in <u>paper.log</u>, and the  output  file  will  be  in
       <u>paper.dvi</u>.

       This  version  of TeX can look in the first line of the file <u>paper.tex</u> to see if it begins with the magic
       sequence <u>%&amp;</u>.  If the first line begins with <b>%&amp;</b><u>format</u> <b>-translate-file</b> <u>tcxname</u> then TeX will use the  named
       format  and  translation  table  <u>tcxname</u>  to  process  the  source  file.   Either the format name or the
       <b>-translate-file</b> specification may be omitted, but not both.  This overrides the format selection based on
       the name by which  the  program  is  invoked.   The  <b>-parse-first-line</b>  option  or  the  <b>parse_first_line</b>
       configuration variable controls whether this behaviour is enabled.

       The  <u>e</u> response to TeX's error prompt causes the system default editor to start up at the current line of
       the current file.  The environment variable TEXEDIT can be used  to  change  the  editor  used.   It  may
       contain  a string with "%s" indicating where the filename goes and "%d" indicating where the decimal line
       number (if any) goes.  For example, a TEXEDIT string for <b>emacs</b> can be set with the <b>sh</b> command
       <u>TEXEDIT="emacs</u> <u>+%d</u> <u>%s";</u> <u>export</u> <u>TEXEDIT</u>

       A convenient file in the library is <u>null.tex</u>, containing nothing.  When TeX can't find a file  it  thinks
       you  want  to input, it keeps asking you for another filename; responding `null' gets you out of the loop
       if you don't want to input anything.  You can also type your EOF character (usually control-D).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This version of TeX understands the following command line options.

       <b>-cnf-line</b> <u>string</u>
              Parse <u>string</u> as a <u>texmf.cnf</u> configuration line.  See the Kpathsea manual.

       <b>-enc</b>   Enable the encTeX extensions.  This option is  only  effective  in  combination  with  <b>-ini</b>.   For
              documentation of the encTeX extensions see <b><a href="http://www.olsak.net/enctex.html">http://www.olsak.net/enctex.html</a></b>.

       <b>-file-line-error</b>
              Print error messages in the form <u>file:line:error</u> which is similar to the way many compilers format
              them.

       <b>-no-file-line-error</b>
              Disable printing error messages in the <u>file:line:error</u> style.

       <b>-file-line-error-style</b>
              This is the old name of the <b>-file-line-error</b> option.

       <b>-fmt</b> <u>format</u>
              Use  <u>format</u> as the name of the format to be used, instead of the name by which TeX was called or a
              <u>%&amp;</u> line.

       <b>-halt-on-error</b>
              Exit with an error code when an error is encountered during processing.

       <b>-help</b>  Print help message and exit.

       <b>-ini</b>   Start in <u>INI</u> mode, which is used to dump formats.  The <u>INI</u> mode can be used for  typesetting,  but
              no format is preloaded, and basic initializations like setting catcodes may be required.

       <b>-interaction</b> <u>mode</u>
              Sets  the  interaction  mode.   The  mode  can  be  either <u>batchmode</u>, <u>nonstopmode</u>, <u>scrollmode</u>, and
              <u>errorstopmode</u>.  The meaning of these modes is the same as that of the corresponding \commands.

       <b>-ipc</b>   Send DVI output to a socket as well as the usual output file.  Whether this option is available is
              the choice of the installer.

       <b>-ipc-start</b>
              As <b>-ipc</b>, and starts the server at the other end as well.  Whether this option is available is  the
              choice of the installer.

       <b>-jobname</b> <u>name</u>
              Use <u>name</u> for the job name, instead of deriving it from the name of the input file.

       <b>-kpathsea-debug</b> <u>bitmask</u>
              Sets  path  searching  debugging  flags  according  to  the  bitmask.  See the <u>Kpathsea</u> manual for
              details.

       <b>-mktex</b> <u>fmt</u>
              Enable mktex<u>fmt</u>, where <u>fmt</u> must be either <u>tex</u> or <u>tfm</u>.

       <b>-mltex</b> Enable MLTeX extensions.  Only effective in combination with <b>-ini</b>.

       <b>-no-mktex</b> <u>fmt</u>
              Disable mktex<u>fmt</u>, where <u>fmt</u> must be either <u>tex</u> or <u>tfm</u>.

       <b>-output-comment</b> <u>string</u>
              Use <u>string</u> for the <u>DVI</u> file comment instead of the date.

       <b>-output-directory</b> <u>directory</u>
              Write output files in <u>directory</u> instead  of  the  current  directory.   Look  up  input  files  in
              <u>directory</u>  first,  then  along  the  normal  search path.  See also description of the TEXMFOUTPUT
              environment variable.

       <b>-parse-first-line</b>
              If the first line of the main input file begins with <u>%&amp;</u> parse it to look for  a  dump  name  or  a
              <b>-translate-file</b> option.

       <b>-no-parse-first-line</b>
              Disable parsing of the first line of the main input file.

       <b>-progname</b> <u>name</u>
              Pretend to be program <u>name</u>.  This affects both the format used and the search paths.

       <b>-recorder</b>
              Enable  the  filename recorder.  This leaves a trace of the files opened for input and output in a
              file with extension <u>.fls</u>.

       <b>-shell-escape</b>
              Enable the <b>\write18{</b><u>command</u><b>}</b> construct.  The <u>command</u> can be any shell command.  This construct  is
              normally disallowed for security reasons.

       <b>-no-shell-escape</b>
              Disable the <b>\write18{</b><u>command</u><b>}</b> construct, even if it is enabled in the <u>texmf.cnf</u> file.

       <b>-src-specials</b>
              Insert source specials into the <u>DVI</u> file.

       <b>-src-specials</b> <u>where</u>
              Insert  source specials in certain places of the <u>DVI</u> file.  <u>where</u> is a comma-separated value list:
              <u>cr</u>, <u>display</u>, <u>hbox</u>, <u>math</u>, <u>par</u>, <u>parent</u>, or <u>vbox</u>.

       <b>-translate-file</b> <u>tcxname</u>
              Use the <u>tcxname</u> translation table to set the mapping of input characters and re-mapping of  output
              characters.

       <b>-default-translate-file</b> <u>tcxname</u>
              Like <b>-translate-file</b> except that a <u>%&amp;</u> line can overrule this setting.

       <b>-version</b>
              Print version information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       See the Kpathsearch library documentation (the `Path specifications' node) for precise details of how the
       environment variables are used.  The <b>kpsewhich</b> utility can be used to query the values of the variables.

       One caveat: In most TeX formats, you cannot use ~ in a filename you give directly to TeX, because ~ is an
       active  character,  and  hence  is  expanded, not taken as part of the filename.  Other programs, such as
       Metafont, do not have this problem.

       <b>TEXMFOUTPUT</b>
              Normally, TeX puts its output files in the current directory.  If any output file cannot be opened
              there, it tries to open it in the directory specified in  the  environment  variable  TEXMFOUTPUT.
              There  is  no  default value for that variable.  For example, if you say <u>tex</u> <u>paper</u> and the current
              directory  is  not  writable,  if  TEXMFOUTPUT  has  the  value  <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>,  TeX  attempts  to   create
              <u>/tmp/paper.log</u>  (and  <u>/tmp/paper.dvi</u>, if any output is produced.)  TEXMFOUTPUT is also checked for
              input files, as TeX often generates files that  need  to  be  subsequently  read;  for  input,  no
              suffixes (such as ``.tex'') are added by default, the input name is simply checked as given.

       <b>TEXINPUTS</b>
              Search  path  for  <u>\input</u>  and <u>\openin</u> files.  This should probably start with ``.'', so that user
              files are found before system files.  An empty path component will  be  replaced  with  the  paths
              defined  in  the <u>texmf.cnf</u> file.  For example, set TEXINPUTS to ".:/home/user/tex:" to prepend the
              current directory and ``/home/user/tex'' to the standard search path.

       <b>TEXFORMATS</b>
              Search path for format files.

       <b>TEXPOOL</b>
              search path for <b>tex</b> internal strings.

       <b>TEXEDIT</b>
              Command template for switching to editor.  The default, usually <b>vi</b>, is set when TeX is compiled.

       <b>TFMFONTS</b>
              Search path for font metric (<u>.tfm</u>) files.

       Notes for Debian developers: please keep in mind, that this version of the TeX  interpreter  ignores  the
       <b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b>  variable.  Instead  the  current timestamp is written into the <u>DVI</u> file. If you need a
       reproducible time stamp, please use any engine based on pdfTeX, e.g., etex, pdftex, latex, pdflatex.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The location of the files mentioned below varies from system to system.  Use  the  <b>kpsewhich</b>  utility  to
       find their locations.

       <u>texmf.cnf</u>
              Configuration  file.   This  contains  definitions  of search paths as well as other configuration
              parameters like <b>parse_first_line</b>.

       <u>tex.pool</u>
              Text file containing TeX's internal strings.

       <u>texfonts.map</u>
              Filename mapping definitions.

       <u>*.tfm</u>  Metric files for TeX's fonts.

       <u>*.fmt</u>  Predigested TeX format (.fmt) files.

       <u>$TEXMFMAIN/tex/plain/base/plain.tex</u>
              The basic macro package described in the TeXbook.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of  TeX  can
       be found in the info manual <u>Web2C:</u> <u>A</u> <u>TeX</u> <u>implementation</u>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This  version  of  TeX  implements  a  number  of optional extensions.  In fact, many of these extensions
       conflict to a greater or lesser extent with the definition of TeX.  When such extensions are enabled, the
       banner printed when TeX starts is changed to print <b>TeXk</b> instead of <b>TeX</b>.

       This version of TeX fails to trap arithmetic overflow when dimensions are  added  or  subtracted.   Cases
       where this occurs are rare, but when it does the generated <u>DVI</u> file will be invalid.

</pre><h4><b>TRIVIA</b></h4><pre>
       TeX,  pronounced  properly,  rhymes  with  ``blecchhh.''  The proper spelling in typewriter-like fonts is
       ``TeX'' and not ``TEX'' or ``tex.''

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       TeX was created by Donald E. Knuth, who implemented it using his Web system for Pascal programs.  It  was
       ported  to  Unix  at Stanford by Howard Trickey, and at Cornell by Pavel Curtis.  The version now offered
       with the Unix TeX distribution is that generated by the Web to C system (<b>web2c</b>),  originally  written  by
       Tomas Rokicki and Tim Morgan.

       The encTeX extensions were written by Petr Olsak.
