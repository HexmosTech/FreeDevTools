</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lintex - removes TeX-related garbage files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lintex</b> [ <b>-i</b> ] [ <b>-r</b> ] [ <b>-b</b> <b>ext</b> ] [ <b>-p</b> ]  [ <b>-k</b> ] [ <b>-o</b> ] [ <b>-q</b> ] [ <b>-v</b> ] [ <b>-d</b> ]  [ <u>dir</u> [ <u>dir</u> ... ]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lintex</b>  is a program that removes TeX-related auxiliary files, normally not needed after a successful TeX
       run (i.e. log, aux, dvi, ... files); they are actually removed only if their  modification  timestamp  is
       more  recent  than  the  one of the related TeX source and if they aren't readonly.  In addition, all the
       backup files that your favorite editor has generated are also removed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-i</b>     Asks the user permission before actually removing any file.

       <b>-r</b>     The given directories are scanned recursively; i.e., if they contain any  subdirectory  structure,
              all the tree will be cleaned up.

       <b>-b</b> <b>ext</b> <b>ext</b>  is  the  trailer  string (the ´extension´) that identifies the backup files generated by your
              editor, e.g.  <b>-b</b> <b>.bak</b>; <b>ext</b> defaults to ~ (the tilde character), i.e. to the <u>emacs</u> convention.   If
              <b>ext</b>  includes  characters  having  a special meaning for the shell, it must be enclosed in quotes:
              e.g.  <b>-b</b> <b>"~"</b> (equivalent to the default).  Specifying the null string, as in <b>-b</b> <b>""</b>,  inhibits  the
              cleanup of any special file.

       <b>-p</b>     Pretends, show what files would be removed but don't actually remove them.

       <b>-k</b>     Keeps final documents (.pdf, .ps, .dvi).

       <b>-o</b>     Permits the removal of files older than their sources.

       <b>-q</b>     Quiet, only prints error messages.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose, prints which files were removed and which weren't.

       <b>-d</b>     Debug, prints the answers to all of life's questions.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>dir</u>    The  name(s),  separated  by whitespace, of one or more directories to be cleaned; if missing, the
              default is the current directory.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENSIONS</b> <b>THAT</b> <b>GET</b> <b>REMOVED</b></h4><pre>
       All files ending in the following extensions may be removed when appropriate:

          .aux, .bbl, .bcf, .blg, .dvi, .idx, .ilg, .ind, .lof, .log, .lot, .nav, .out, .pdf, .ps,  .snm,  .thm,
       .toc, .toc.old, .synctex.gz, .xyc

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>HOME</b> environment variable determines the location of the configuration file, see <b>FILES</b> below.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Users  can create a configuration file <u>$HOME/.lintexrc</u> which optionally contains the keys <b>remove-exts</b> and
       <b>keep-exts</b>, each followed  by  a  Python  style  list  of  extensions  to  additionally  remove  or  keep,
       respectively.  Each extension <u>must</u> be preceded by a period, e.g. ".pdf" and not "pdf".  The <b>keep-exts</b> key
       is only used when the keep option (<b>-k</b>) is passed.  Note that the extensions listed in the <b>keep-exts</b> field
       replace  the defaults used by the <b>-k</b> option. The <b>keep-exts</b> option also takes precedence over <b>remove-exts</b>:
       no file ending in an extension removed by default or  listed  in  <b>remove-exts</b>  will  be  deleted  if  its
       extension is listed in <b>keep-exts</b> and the <b>-k</b> option was passed. For example, the configuration file

           keep-exts = [".pdf", ".ps", ".log"];
           remove-exts = [".txt", ".1"];

       will  keep  any  file ending in ".pdf", ".ps" or ".log" when lintex is called with the <b>-k</b> option (but <u>not</u>
       files ending in ".dvi"), and adds ".txt" and ".1" to the list of extensions to  check  for  removal.  The
       following configuration file provides lintex with its default behaviour:

           keep-exts = [".pdf", ".ps", ".dvi"];
           remove-exts = [];

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       lintex  cannot  handle extensions containing periods, for example, ".toc.old" and ".synctex.gz", since it
       splits filenames at the last period to find the extension, treating "foo.toc.old" as the  file  "foo.toc"
       with the extension ".old".
