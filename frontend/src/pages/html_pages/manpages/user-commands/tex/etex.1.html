</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       etex - extended (plain) TeX

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>etex</b> [<u>options</u>] [<b>&amp;</b><u>format</u>] [<u>file</u>|<b>\</b><u>commands</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Run  the  e-TeX typesetter on <u>file</u>, by default creating <u>file.dvi</u>.  If the file argument has no extension,
       ".tex" will be appended to it.  Instead of a filename, a set of e-TeX commands can be given, the first of
       which must start with a backslash.  With a <b>&amp;</b><u>format</u> argument e-TeX uses a  different  set  of  precompiled
       commands, contained in <u>format</u><b>.fmt</b>; it is usually better to use the <b>-fmt</b> <u>format</u> option instead.

       e-TeX  is  the first concrete result of an international research &amp; development project, the NTS Project,
       which was established under the aegis of DANTE  e.V.  during  1992.  The  aims  of  the  project  are  to
       perpetuate  and  develop the spirit and philosophy of TeX, whilst respecting Knuth's wish that TeX should
       remain frozen.

       e-TeX can be used in two different  modes:  in  <u>compatibility</u>  <u>mode</u>  it  is  supposed  to  be  completely
       interchangable  with  standard  TeX.   In  <u>extended</u> <u>mode</u> several new primitives are added that facilitate
       (among other things) bidirectional typesetting.

       An extended mode format is generated by prefixing the name of the source file  for  the  format  with  an
       asterisk (*).

       e-TeX's  handling of its command-line arguments is similar to that of the other TeX programs in the <u>web2c</u>
       implementation.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This version of e-TeX understands the following command line options.

       <b>-fmt</b> <u>format</u>
              Use <u>format</u> as the name of the format to be used, instead of the name by which e-TeX was called  or
              a <u>%&amp;</u> line.

       <b>-enc</b>   Enable  the  encTeX  extensions.   This  option  is  only effective in combination with <b>-ini</b>.  For
              documentation of the encTeX extensions see <b><a href="http://www.olsak.net/enctex.html">http://www.olsak.net/enctex.html</a></b>.

       <b>-etex</b>  Enable the e-TeX extensions.  This option is only effective in combination with <b>-ini</b>.

       <b>-file-line-error</b>
              Print error messages in the form <u>file:line:error</u> which is similar to the way many compilers format
              them.

       <b>-no-file-line-error</b>
              Disable printing error messages in the <u>file:line:error</u> style.

       <b>-file-line-error-style</b>
              This is the old name of the <b>-file-line-error</b> option.

       <b>-halt-on-error</b>
              Exit with an error code when an error is encountered during processing.

       <b>-help</b>  Print help message and exit.

       <b>-ini</b>   Start in <u>INI</u> mode, which is used to dump formats.  The <u>INI</u> mode can be used for  typesetting,  but
              no format is preloaded, and basic initializations like setting catcodes may be required.

       <b>-interaction</b> <u>mode</u>
              Sets  the  interaction  mode.   The  mode  can  be  either <u>batchmode</u>, <u>nonstopmode</u>, <u>scrollmode</u>, and
              <u>errorstopmode</u>.  The meaning of these modes is the same as that of the corresponding \commands.

       <b>-ipc</b>   Send DVI output to a socket as well as the usual output file.  Whether this option is available is
              the choice of the installer.

       <b>-ipc-start</b>
              As <b>-ipc</b>, and starts the server at the other end as well.  Whether this option is available is  the
              choice of the installer.

       <b>-jobname</b> <u>name</u>
              Use <u>name</u> for the job name, instead of deriving it from the name of the input file.

       <b>-kpathsea-debug</b> <u>bitmask</u>
              Sets  path  searching  debugging  flags  according  to  the  bitmask.  See the <u>Kpathsea</u> manual for
              details.

       <b>-mktex</b> <u>fmt</u>
              Enable mktex<u>fmt</u>, where <u>fmt</u> must be either <u>tex</u> or <u>tfm</u>.

       <b>-mltex</b> Enable MLTeX extensions.  Only effective in combination with <b>-ini</b>.

       <b>-no-mktex</b> <u>fmt</u>
              Disable mktex<u>fmt</u>, where <u>fmt</u> must be either <u>tex</u> or <u>tfm</u>.

       <b>-output-comment</b> <u>string</u>
              Use <u>string</u> for the <u>DVI</u> file comment instead of the date.

       <b>-output-directory</b> <u>directory</u>
              Write output files in <u>directory</u> instead  of  the  current  directory.   Look  up  input  files  in
              <u>directory</u> first, the along the normal search path.

       <b>-parse-first-line</b>
              If  the  first  line  of  the main input file begins with <u>%&amp;</u> parse it to look for a dump name or a
              <b>-translate-file</b> option.

       <b>-no-parse-first-line</b>
              Disable parsing of the first line of the main input file.

       <b>-progname</b> <u>name</u>
              Pretend to be program <u>name</u>.  This affects both the format used and the search paths.

       <b>-recorder</b>
              Enable the filename recorder.  This leaves a trace of the files opened for input and output  in  a
              file with extension <u>.fls</u>.

       <b>-shell-escape</b>
              Enable  the <b>\write18{</b><u>command</u><b>}</b> construct.  The <u>command</u> can be any shell command.  This construct is
              normally disallowed for security reasons.

       <b>-no-shell-escape</b>
              Disable the <b>\write18{</b><u>command</u><b>}</b> construct, even if it is enabled in the <u>texmf.cnf</u> file.

       <b>-src-specials</b>
              Insert source specials into the <u>DVI</u> file.

       <b>-src-specials</b> <u>where</u>
              Insert source specials in certain placed of the <u>DVI</u> file.  <u>where</u> is a comma-separated value  list:
              <u>cr</u>, <u>display</u>, <u>hbox</u>, <u>math</u>, <u>par</u>, <u>parent</u>, or <u>vbox</u>.

       <b>-translate-file</b> <u>tcxname</u>
              Use  the <u>tcxname</u> translation table to set the mapping of input characters and re-mapping of output
              characters.

       <b>-default-translate-file</b> <u>tcxname</u>
              Like <b>-translate-file</b> except that a <u>%&amp;</u> line can overrule this setting.

       <b>-version</b>
              Print version information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       See the Kpathsearch library documentation (the `Path specifications' node) for precise details of how the
       environment variables are used.  The <b>kpsewhich</b> utility can be used to query the values of the variables.

       One caveat: In most e-TeX formats, you cannot use ~ in a filename you give directly to e-TeX,  because  ~
       is  an  active character, and hence is expanded, not taken as part of the filename.  Other programs, such
       as Metafont, do not have this problem.

       <b>TEXMFOUTPUT</b>
              Normally, e-TeX puts its output files in the current directory.  If  any  output  file  cannot  be
              opened  there,  it  tries  to  open  it  in  the  directory  specified in the environment variable
              TEXMFOUTPUT.  There is no default value for that variable.  For example, if you say <u>etex</u> <u>paper</u> and
              the current directory is not writable, if TEXMFOUTPUT has the value <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>, e-TeX attempts to create
              <u>/tmp/paper.log</u> (and <u>/tmp/paper.dvi</u>, if any output is produced.)  TEXMFOUTPUT is also  checked  for
              input  files,  as  TeX  often  generates  files  that  need to be subsequently read; for input, no
              suffixes (such as ``.tex'') are added by default, the input name is simply checked as given.

       <b>TEXINPUTS</b>
              Search path for <u>\input</u> and <u>\openin</u> files.  This should start with ``.'', so that  user  files  are
              found before system files.  An empty path component will be replaced with the paths defined in the
              <u>texmf.cnf</u> file.  For example, set TEXINPUTS to ".:/home/user/tex:" to prepend the current direcory
              and ``/home/user/tex'' to the standard search path.

       <b>TEXFORMATS</b>
              Search path for format files.

       <b>TEXPOOL</b>
              search path for <b>etex</b> internal strings.

       <b>TEXEDIT</b>
              Command template for switching to editor.  The default, usually <b>vi</b>, is set when e-TeX is compiled.

       <b>TFMFONTS</b>
              Search path for font metric (<u>.tfm</u>) files.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  location  of  the  files mentioned below varies from system to system.  Use the <b>kpsewhich</b> utility to
       find their locations.

       <u>etex.pool</u>
              Text file containing e-TeX's internal strings.

       <u>texfonts.map</u>
              Filename mapping definitions.

       <u>*.tfm</u>  Metric files for e-TeX's fonts.

       <u>*.fmt</u>  Predigested e-TeX format (.fmt) files.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Starting with version 1.40, pdfTeX incorporates the e-TeX extensions, so in this installation eTeX may be
       just a symbolic link to pdfTeX.  See <b><a href="../man1/pdftex.1.html">pdftex</a></b>(1).  This manual page is not meant  to  be  exhaustive.   The
       complete  documentation  for  this  version  of  e-TeX  can  be  found  in  the  info manual <u>Web2C:</u> <u>A</u> <u>TeX</u>
       <u>implementation</u>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This version of e-TeX implements a number of optional extensions.  In  fact,  many  of  these  extensions
       conflict  to  a greater or lesser extent with the definition of e-TeX.  When such extensions are enabled,
       the banner printed when e-TeX starts is changed to print <b>e-TeXk</b> instead of <b>e-TeX</b>.

       This version of e-TeX fails to trap arithmetic overflow when dimensions are added or  subtracted.   Cases
       where this occurs are rare, but when it does the generated <u>DVI</u> file will be invalid.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       e-TeX  was  developed  by  Peter  Breitenlohner  and  the NTS team; Peter later continued its development
       outside of the team.

       TeX was designed by Donald E. Knuth, who implemented it using his Web system for Pascal programs.  It was
       ported to Unix at Stanford by Howard Trickey, and at Cornell by Pavel Curtis.  The  version  now  offered
       with  the  Unix  TeX distribution is that generated by the Web to C system (<b>web2c</b>), originally written by
       Tomas Rokicki and Tim Morgan.

       The encTeX extensions were written by Petr Olsak.
