       ctanglex, cweavex - translate CWEB(x) to C (or C++) and/or TeX

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ctanglex</b> [ <b>-bhpl</b> ] [ <b>+cs+</b> ] <u>cwebfile</u>[.w] [(<u>changefile</u>[.ch]|+|-) [<u>outputfile</u>[.c]]]
       <b>cweavex</b>   [   <b>-bhpx</b>   ]   [   <b>+cs+dtefauwm</b>   ]   [  <b>+isearchpath</b>  ]  <u>cwebfile</u>[.w]  [(<u>changefile</u>[.ch]|+|-)
       [<u>outputfile</u>[.tex]]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ctanglex</b> program converts a CWEB(x) source document into a C program that  may  be  compiled  in  the
       usual  way.   The  output file includes <u>#line</u> specifications so that error reporting and debugging can be
       done in terms of the CWEB(x) source file.

       The <b>cweavex</b> program converts the same CWEB(x) file into a TeX file that may be formatted and  printed  in
       the  usual  way.   It  takes  appropriate  care  of  typographic  details like page layout and the use of
       indentation, italics, boldface, etc., and it  supplies  extensive  cross-reference  information  that  it
       gathers automatically.

       CWEBx  allows  you  to  prepare  a  single document containing all the information that is needed both to
       produce a compilable C program and to produce a well-formatted document describing the program in as much
       detail as the writer may desire.  The user of CWEBx ought to have some familiarity with TeX  as  well  as
       knowledge of C.

       The  command line should have one, two, or three names on it. The first is taken as the CWEB(x) file (and
       `<u>.w</u>' is added if there is no extension). If that file cannot be opened, the  extension  `<u>.web</u>'  is  tried
       instead.  If  there  is a second name, it is a change file (and `<u>.ch</u>' is added if there is no extension),
       otherwise the name of the CWEB(x) file with its extension replaced by `<u>.ch</u>' is tried as change file name;
       if there no such file, no change file is used. Instead of a change file one may specify `<b>-</b>' or  `<b>+</b>';  `<b>-</b>'
       means do not use a change file, and `<b>+</b>' means use a change file only if a file of the default name exists
       (just  as  if only one name was given). The change file overrides parts of the CWEB(x) file, as described
       in the documentation. A third name, if present, specifies the output file name  explicitly.  The  default
       output  file  name is that of the CWEB(x) file with extension `<u>.c</u>' (for <b>ctanglex</b> ) or `<u>.tex</u>' (for <b>cweavex</b>
       ); the default extension is also applied if a third name is given without extension.

       Options in the command line may be either turned on with `<b>+</b>' and off with  `<b>-</b>';  several  characters  may
       follow  in  the  same  argument,  which  indicate  several  options  that  are turned on respectively off
       simultaneously.  In fact, the options are processed from left to right, so a sequence  like  `<b>-b</b>  <b>+b</b>'  is
       equivalent to `<b>+b</b>' (which is the default).

       The <b>+b</b> option shows a banner line on your terminal. The <b>+h</b> option shows a happy message if the processing
       was  successful.  The  <b>+p</b>  option shows progress reports (starred module numbers) as the processing takes
       place. If you say `<b>-bhp</b>', you get no terminal output but error messages.

       The <b>+c</b> option emulates Levy/Knuth CWEB.  The <b>+s</b> option prints statistics about memory usage at the end of
       a run (assuming that the programs have been compiled with the <u>-DSTAT</u> switch, as they are  by  default  on
       Debian systems).  By setting the option <b>++</b> one can select the C++ language instead of C.

       The  option  <b>-l</b>  is  applicable  to  <b>ctanglex</b> only; when selected, the C output is made more readable for
       humans by omitting <b>#line</b> directives and preserving layout and comments.

       There are several other options applicable to <b>cweavex</b> only. The option <b>-x</b> means omit the index and  table
       of  contents.  By  setting the option <b>+d</b> one causes <b>cweavex</b> to report problems encountered in parsing the
       program fragments. With <b>+t</b> the index and module names will be written to  separate  files.  With  <b>+e</b>  the
       table  of contents is forced to start on a new sheet when using a two-sided printer.  The options <b>+f</b> , <b>+a</b>
       , <b>+u</b> , <b>+w</b> , and <b>+m</b> change the style in which programs are formatted: <b>+f</b> means force a newline after every
       simple statement in the formatted output,  and  <b>+a</b>  means  also  force  a  newline  before  every  simple
       statement,  even if it follows a label or a condition; the option <b>+u</b> will change the style so that a line
       break goes after `{' instead of before, thus preventing them from aligning with their matching `}'  (this
       is  the  style  of  Levy/Knuth  CWEB),  while  the option <b>+w</b> puts a line break both before and after `{',
       producing a more symmetric layout at the expense of some extra  paper.  Finally,  the  option  <b>+m</b>  avoids
       forcing  line  breaks between successive declarations in a local block.  With the option <b>+isearchpath</b> one
       can specify a place to look for header files, when they are not  found  in  the  current  directory.  The
       string  following  the  `+i'  will  be  stored  and prepended to a header file name if it cannot be found
       otherwise (so the string should probably end with a pathname separator '/'). More than  one  such  search
       path can be specified; they will be tried in order from left to right.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>

       <u>/usr/share/texmf/macros/litprog/cwebcmac.tex</u> TeX macros used in compatibility mode.
       <u>/usr/share/texmf/macros/litprog/cwebhmac.tex</u>  TeX  macros  which  can  be input after <u>cwebxmac</u> to produce
       hyperlinks in the output.
       <u>/usr/share/doc/cwebx/manual.tex</u> The user manual source.
       <u>/usr/share/doc/cwebx/manual.tex</u> The user manual in DVI format.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       Don Knuth wrote WEB for TeX and Pascal. Silvio Levy designed and  developed  CWEB  by  adapting  the  WEB
       conventions  to  C  and by recoding everything in CWEB.  Frank Jensen adapted the programs to ANSI/ISO C,
       and Marc van Leeuwen made numerous changes for version x3.0, and wrote a new manual.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The syntactic support for C++ does not cover that language completely, so formatting of complex C++  code
       may be bad.
