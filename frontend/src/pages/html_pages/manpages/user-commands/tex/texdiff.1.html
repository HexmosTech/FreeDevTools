</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>texdiff</b>  -  Compares two (La)TeX documents to create a merged version showing changes, similar to that of
       'Change Tracking' in some word processors.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       texdiff [--nofloatsâŽª-n] old.tex new.tex [diff.tex]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The first two files are compared and a new TeX file is output. When the output  file  is  processed  with
       (La)TeX  it  marks  new  changes with blue and old text with red with a strike-through line. Furthermore,
       passages with changes are marked at the margin with grey bars by the LaTeX "changebar" package  (although
       only  after  running  "dvips",  in  "xdvi"  the bars are one inch too far left to compensate the one inch
       offset inserted by TeX printer drivers).

       "texdiff" uses and therefore requires the "wdiff" command to insert these  marks.  If  LaTeX  macros  are
       included  in those striked out or underlined passages, the latex run will most likely fail. The source of
       most problems lies in "wdiff" tearing apart pairs of braces. Therefore "texdiff" is a  perl  script  that
       calls "wdiff" internally and fixes "wdiff"'s output by re-pairing braces again and handling some commonly
       used LaTeX macros.

       For texdiff to work, the following LaTeX code must be inserted in the preamble of the LaTeX document:

        \usepackage{xcolor} \usepackage{ulem} \usepackage{changebar}
        \newcommand\TLSins[1]{\cbstart{}\textcolor{ins}{\uline{#1}}\cbend{}}
        \newcommand\TLSdel[1]{\cbdelete{}\textcolor{del}{\sout{#1}}}

       Define editing colors "ins" and "del" with existing "xcolor" color names:
        \colorlet{ins}{blue} \colorlet{del}{red}

       Or from scratch:
        \definecolor{ins}{rgb}{0, 0.5, 0}

       These  macros  are  NOT automatically interted at \begin{document} like the original scripts did (see the
       <b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b> section below), because this will not work on  files  of  a  multi-file  document  (those
       included  by  \include  or \input).  Furthermore, if you insert the macros manually, you can tune them as
       you like, i. e. change text color or position of changebars. Have a look at the documentation of the ulem
       and changebar packages on how to do this!

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--nofloats</b>, <b>-n</b>
           If given, skips contents of figure environments, but  does  show  insertions  and  deletions  in  the
           caption commands. This is done to avoid complex messups in subfloat or complex figure environments.

       <b>--debug</b>, <b>-d</b>
           Turns  on  debugging. Temporary files that contain numbered braces are kept and a raw difference file
           is written as output file name appended with '-wdiff.tex'. In addition,  several  regular  expression
           diagnostics are printed. <b>Warning:</b> <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>output.</b>

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>*</b>   Version  0.4,  by  CG,  2009/09/15.  Added  use of GetOpt to take an optional parameter to skip float
           (e.g., figure or table) contents. Added an optional debug mode.  Embedded  POD  documentation.  Fixed
           problem  with  insertion and deletions appearing in the middle of sectioning commands by throwing off
           LaTeX.

       <b>*</b>   Version 0.3, modified by Cengiz Gunay &lt;<a href="mailto:cengique@users.sf.net">cengique@users.sf.net</a>&gt;, 2009/06/30. Added some Latex  commands
           that should be excluded and fixed handling of '\%' characters.

       <b>*</b>   Version  0.2, is a perl implementation of TeXdiff by Mark Doll &lt;<a href="mailto:markdoll@gmx.net">markdoll@gmx.net</a>&gt;, 2006/08/09. It was
           derived from the original bash and  perl  scripts  created  by  Robert  Maron  &lt;<a href="mailto:robmar@mimuw.edu.pl">robmar@mimuw.edu.pl</a>&gt;,
           available   at   <a href="http://www.robmar.net/TexDiff/">http://www.robmar.net/TexDiff/</a>.   This   version   of   texdiff   is   available  at
