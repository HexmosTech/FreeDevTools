</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tth, latex2gif, ps2gif, ps2png - TeX and LaTeX to HTML translator and its auxiliary program

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tth</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>&lt;file.tex</u>] [<u>&gt;file.html</u>] [<u>2&gt;err</u>]

       <b>tth</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>file.tex</u> [<u>2&gt;err</u>]

       <b>latex2gif</b> <u>file</u> (no extension)

       <b>ps2gif</b> <u>file.ps</u> <u>file.gif</u> [<u>icon.gif</u>]

       <b>ps2png</b> <u>file.ps</u> <u>file.gif</u> [<u>icon.gif</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>tth</u>  translates TeX source that uses the plain macro package or LaTeX, including most mathematics, into a
       near equivalent in HTML. The formal standard that TTH-translated documents  follow  is  strictly  HTML4.0
       Transitional.

       The  complete documentation is contained in "tth_manual.html" distributed with the program. This man page
       is an incomplete summary and updated on an irregular basis. [Last updated 1  May  2002  by  Hans  Fredrik
       Nordhaug.]

       The  program  is  a filter, i.e. it reads from standard input and writes to standard output. In addition,
       diagnostic messages concerning its detection of unknown or untranslated constructs are sent  to  standard
       error.

       In  handling embedded graphical files <u>tth</u> can make use of auxiliary programs,  <u>ps2gif</u> or <u>ps2png</u>, which in
       turn make use of the ghostscript interpreter <u>gs</u> (1) and the Portable Bitmap Graphics suite  of  commands,
       see <u>pbm</u> (1).

       <u>tth</u>  is  extremely  fast  in default mode on any reasonable hardware.  Conversion of even large TeX files
       should be a matter of a second or two.  This makes it possible to use <u>tth</u> in a CGI script to output  HTML
       directly from TeX source if desired; (standard error may then need to be redirected.)

       <u>tth</u> handles TeX things like:
          Almost all mathematics, including symbols, fractions, delimiters.
          {} \begingroup\endgroup  grouping.
          \it \bf \sl etc  styles.
          \beginsection.
          \centerline{}.
          \item{...} \itemitem{...} {\obeylines  ...}.
          Almost all accented latin characters written like \"o, or \"{e}.
          \hang \hangindent \narrower for entire paragraphs
            (\hangafter ignored).
          \headline is made into a title.
          % Comments. Simply removed.
          \halign tables, checks template for the presence of \vrule,
            to decide if the table is to be border style.
          \settabs \+ style tables.
          \input: But, of course, not from the implicit texinputs path.
          \newcount, \number, \advance and counter setting.
          \def, \edef, \xdef but no delimited arguments.
            All definitions are global.
          \matrix, \pmatrix but not \bordermatrix. \cases.

       LaTeX support includes essentially all mathematics plus the following environments:
          em,  verbatim,  center,  flushright [one paragraph only], verse, quotation, quote, itemize, enumerate,
          description, list [treated as if description], figure,  table,  tabular[*,x],  equation,  displaymath,
          eqnarray [only one equation number], math, array, thebibliography, [raw]html, index [as description].
       and LaTeX commands:
          [re]newcommand,   newenvironment   [optional   arg   not  permitted],  chapter,  section,  subsection,
          subsubsection, caption, label, ref, pageref [no number],  emph,  textit,  texttt,  textbf,  centering,
          raggedleft,   includegraphics,   [e]psfig,   title,  author,  date  [not  automatic],  lefteqn,  frac,
          tableofcontents, input, include [as input], textcolor, color [8 standard colors],  footnote  [ignoring
          optional  arg],  cite,  bibitem, bibliography, tiny ... normalsize ... Huge, newcounter [no ``within''
          support], setcounter, addtocounter, value [inside set or addto  counter],  arabic,  the,  stepcounter,
          newline,  verb[*],  bfseries,  itshape,  ttfamily,  textsc,  ensuremath,  listoftables, listoffigures,
          newtheorem [no optional  arguments  permitted],  today,  printindex,  boldmath,  unboldmath,  newfont,
          thanks, makeindex, index.

       Hypertext   cross-references  within  the  document  are  automatically  generated  by  (e.g.)  ref,  and
       tableofcontents.

       When <u>tth</u> encounters TeX constructs that it cannot handle either because there is no HTML  equivalent,  or
       because it is not clever enough, it tries to remove the mess they would otherwise cause in the HTML code,
       generally  giving  a  warning  of the action if it is not sure what it is doing.  Untranslatable TeX math
       tokens are inserted verbatim.

</pre><h4><b>Independence</b> <b>of</b> <b>[La]TeX</b> <b>installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>-L</b> <b>switch</b></h4><pre>
       A major difference between <u>tth</u> and <u>latex2html</u> is that <u>tth</u> does not call the <u>latex</u> or <u>tex</u> programs at  all
       by default, and is not specifically dependent upon these, or indeed any other (e.g. <u>perl</u>), programs being
       installed on the translating system.  Its portability is therefore virtually universal.

       Forward  references  in  LaTeX are handled by multiple passes that write auxiliary files. <u>tth</u> does only a
       single pass through the source.   If  you  want  <u>tth</u>  to  use  LaTeX  constructs  (e.g.  tableofcontents,
       bibliographic  commands,  etc.) that depend on auxiliary files, then you do need to run LaTeX on the code
       so that these files are generated. Alternatively, the <u>tth</u> switch -a causes <u>tth</u> automatically  to  attempt
       to run <u>latex</u> on the file, if no auxiliary file .aux exists.

       When run specifying a filename on the command line as a non-switch argument, x <u>tth</u> constructs the name of
       the expected auxiliary LaTeX files in the usual way and looks for them in the same directory as the file.
       If you are using <u>tth</u>  as a filter, you must tell <u>tth</u> , using the switch -Lfilename, the base file name of
       these  auxiliary  files  (which  is the name of the original file omitting the extension). If <u>tth</u>  cannot
       find the relevant auxiliary file because you didn't run LaTeX and generate the files  or  didn't  include
       the  switch,  then  it will omit the construct and warn you.  Forward references via ref will not work if
       the .aux file is unavailable, but backward references will. The -L switch with no filename may be used to
       tell <u>tth</u>  that the document being translated is to be interpreted as a LaTeX file even  though  it  lacks
       the  usual LaTeX header commands. This may be useful for translating single equations that (unwisely) use
       the \frac command.

</pre><h4><b>BibTeX</b> <b>bibliographies</b></h4><pre>
       <u>tth</u>  supports  bibliographies  that  are  created  by  hand  using  \begin{thebibliography}   etc.   Such
       bibliographies  do  not  require  anything beyond the .aux file. <u>tth</u> also supports bibliographies created
       using BibTeX from a biblography database. The filename.bbl file is input at  the  correct  place  in  the
       document.  However, this filename.bbl is not created automatically by <u>latex</u>. In addition to running <u>latex</u>
       on  the  source  file  to  create  the  auxiliary file, you must also execute bibtex filename in the same
       directory, to create the filename.bbl file, and then run <u>latex</u> again to get the references  right.  (This
       is, of course, no more than the standard procedure for using <u>bibtex</u> with <u>latex</u> but it must be done if you
       want <u>tth</u> to get your bibliography right). If you don't create the
        .bbl  file, or if you create it somewhere else that  <u>tth</u> does not search, then naturally  <u>tth</u> won't find
       it. Since the BibTeX process is relatively tortuous,  <u>tth</u> offers an alternative. Using the -a switch with
       <u>tth</u> will cause it to attempt to generate the required .bbl file automatically using <u>bibtex</u> and <u>latex</u>.

       There are many different styles for bibliographies and  a  large  number  of  different  LaTeX  extension
       packages  has  grown  up  to  implement  them,  which  <u>tth</u> does not support. More recently, a significant
       rationalization of the situation has been achieved by the package natbib.  <u>tth</u>  has  rudimentary  support
       built  in  for  its  commands  \citep and citet in the default author-date form without a second optional
       argument.  A style file for natbib is distributed with TTHgold which makes  it  possible  to  accommodate
       most  of  its  more  useful  styles  and  commands and easily switch from author-date citation to numeric
       citation.

</pre><h4><b>Indexing</b></h4><pre>
       <u>tth</u> can make an extremely useful hyperlinked index using LaTeX automatic indexing entries.  But  indexing
       an  HTML  document  is different from indexing a printed document, because a printed index refers to page
       numbers, which have no meaning in HTML because there are no page breaks. TTH indexes LaTeX  documents  by
       section  number rather than by page; assuming, of course, that they have been prepared with index entries
       in the standard LaTeX fashion.

       <u>tth</u> will construct an index based on the standard LaTeX  commands  "\makeindex"  and  "\index{...}",  and
       automatically  process  it and read it in when "\printindex" is encountered. The command line for calling
       the makeindex program (not part of this distribution) may be changed using the  <u>-x</u>  switch.  For  a  file
       without  the "\makeindex" command, tth will write no index files, just read in an existing one "file.ind"
       if it exists.

</pre><h4><b>Graphics</b> <b>inclusion:</b> <b>epsfbox/includegraphics</b></h4><pre>
       The standard way in plain TeX to include a graphic is  using  the  epsf  macros.  The  work  is  done  by
       \epsfbox{file.ps}  which  <u>tth</u> can parse. By default <u>tth</u> produces a simple link to such a postscript file,
       or indeed any format file.

       Optionally TTH can use a more appropriate graphics format, by using  <u>ps2gif</u>  or  <u>ps2png</u>  to  convert  the
       postscript file to a png or gif file, "file.png" or file.gif" When the switch -e1 or -e2 is specified, if
       ``file.png'',  ``file.gif''  or  ``file.jpg''  already  exists  in  the  same directory as implied by the
       reference to ``file.ps'' then no conversion is done and the file found is used  instead.   That  graphics
       file  is  then  automatically  either  linked  (-e1) or inlined (-e2) in the document. If no such file is
       found, TTH tries to find a postscript file with extension that starts either .ps or .eps and convert  it,
       first  using  ps2png  then,  if unsuccessful, ps2gif. By popular request, a third graphics option -e3 for
       generating icons is now available.

       The LaTeX command \includegraphics{...} and  the  older  \[e]psfig{file=...}  are  treated  the  same  as
       \epsfbox.  Their optional arguments are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>Picture</b> <b>Environments</b></h4><pre>
       The  picture environment cannot be translated to HTML. Pictures using the built-in LaTeX commands must be
       converted to a graphics file such as a gif or png, and then included using \includegraphics.  The  switch
       -a, causes <u>tth</u> to attempt automatic picture conversion using <u>latex2gif</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>     attempt automatic conversion of picture environments. Default omit.

       <b>-c</b>     prefix header "Content-type: text/HTML" (for direct web serving).

       <b>-d</b>     disable definitions with delimited arguments. Default enable.

       <b>-e</b>?    epsfbox  handling:  <b>-e1</b>  convert figure to png/gif using user-supplied ps2png/ps2gif.  <b>-e2</b> convert
              and include inline.  <b>-e3</b> as e2 but with icon.  <b>-e0</b> (default) no conversion, just ref.

       <b>-f</b>?    sets the depth of grouping to which fractions are constructed built-up <b>f5</b>  (default)  allows  five
              levels built-up, <b>f0</b> none, <b>f9</b> lots.

       <b>-g</b>     don't guess an HTML equivalent for font definitions, just remove.

       <b>-h</b>     print some help.  <b>-?</b>  print usage

       <b>-i</b>     use italic font for equations (like TeX). Default roman.

       <b>-j?</b>    use index page length ?. Default 20 lines. -j single column.

       <b>-v</b>     give verbose commentary.

       <b>-V</b>     even more verbose (for debugging).

       <b>-w?</b>    HTML  writing style. Default no head/body tags. -w -w0 no title.  -w1 single title only, head/body
              tags. -w2 XHTML.

       <b>-xmakindxcmd</b>
              specify a non-standard makeindex command line.

       <b>-y?</b>    equation style: bit 1 compress vertically; bit 2 inline overaccents.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The tth manual which is more likely to be up-to-date.  <b><a href="http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/manual.cgi">http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/manual.cgi</a></b> (or
       preferably your local copy). In addition reading the man pages for <u>latex</u>, <u>latex2html</u>, <u>tex</u>  and  <u>makeindex</u>
       might be useful.

</pre><h4><b>Browser</b> <b>Problems</b></h4><pre>
       tth  translates  (La)TeX into standard HTML and takes account as far as possible of the idiosyncrasies of
       the major browsers. Nevertheless, there are several problems  that  are  associated  with  the  browsers.
       Authors and publishers should recognize that these are not tth bugs.

       Many  of  the most serious difficulties of Mathematics rendering in HTML are associated with the need for
       extra symbols. In addition to various Greek letters and mathematical operators, one needs access  to  the
       glyphs  used  to  build up from parts the large brackets matching the height of built-up fractions. These
       symbols are almost universally present on systems with graphical browsers, which all  have  a  ``Symbol''
       font,  generally  based  on  that  made freely available by Adobe. The problem lies in accessing the font
       because of shortcomings in the browsers and the HTML standards that relate to font use.

       For more information please read the section "Browser Problems" in the manual.
