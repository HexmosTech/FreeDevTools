</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hodie - Print current date and time... in Latin

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hodie</b> [ <u>OPTION</u> ]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hodie</b>  prints out the current date using classic Latin, and in addition also prints it out and time using
       Roman numerals.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h, --help
              Print short help message with syntax

       -v, --verbose
              Print months and days (pridie, Kalends, Nones, Ides) full and  not  the  respective  abbreviations
              (standard mode of operation)

              <u>Two</u>  <u>occurrences</u> <u>of</u> -v <u>as</u> <u>well</u> <u>as</u> <u>the</u> <u>use</u> <u>of</u> -vv  <u>or</u> --extremely-verbose will include the numerals
              where applicable fully declined, as in 'ante diem <b>quintum</b> Kalends Septembres'.

       -n, --numerals
              Don't print anything in Latin - only the date and time as Roman numerals.

       -x, --force-numerals
              Print both the verbose latin and the date and time as Roman numerals.

       -c, --classic, --auc
              Print the year in the classic manner <u>ab</u> <u>urbe</u> <u>condita</u> instead of the more modern <u>anno</u> <u>domini</u> <u>.</u>

       -a, --ante-diem
              Print the date expressing the number of days to the next main day with the  <u>ante</u>  <u>diem</u>  expression
              instead of ablative case.

       -d, --date
              Print  out  any  date.  This  has  a  rather  special syntax, with a keyword following the <u>-d</u> flag
              choosing input format. See section on <u>DATE</u> <u>INPUT</u> below.

       -r, --republican OFFSET
              Print out the date dated <u>ab</u> <u>urbe</u> <u>tua</u> <u>condita</u> with the offset counted in years as compared  to  the
              modern european kalendar (originating with the hypothetical birth of christ).  <b>hodie</b> <u>-r</u> <u>-753</u> would
              be equivalent with <b>hodie</b> <u>-c</u>

       --version
              Print  out  the version number of this release and exit. No matter whether other options appear on
              the command line or not.

</pre><h4><b>DATE</b> <b>INPUT</b></h4><pre>
       Following the <u>-d</u> or the <u>--date</u> option flags, the first item <b>must</b> be one of the following:

       verbose
              In this case, the year, month and day are given by following the <u>verbose</u> keyword by the flags  <u>-y,</u>
              <u>--year,</u> <u>-m,</u> <u>--month,</u> <u>-d,</u> <u>--day</u> for year, month and date respectively

       ymd    After  this  flag, the date comes in the format <u>YYYY-MM-DD</u> , where the numbers may be separated by
              any non-numeric character.

       dmy    With this flag, the date is given as <u>DD-MM-YYYY</u>

       mdy    With this flag, the date is given as <u>MM-DD-YYYY</u> Restrictions on the characters  that  may  replace
              the hyphen apply as above.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The  story began on the 10. of August, 2000 (a.d. VI Id. Iul., MM). Having finished most of my assignment
       for my two-month summer job at Ericsson Eurolab Deutschland,  Nuremberg,  I  was  idling  around  on  the
       Internet,  and  stumbled  over  the  dotcomma-challenges <u>&lt;<a href="http://www.dotcomma.org">http://www.dotcomma.org</a>&gt;</u> , where especially the
       Roman numeral challenge started my mind.

       Almost an hour hacking, and there it was, another hour, and the <u>language</u> <u>support</u> was  there.  Before  the
       night was over, I had written this man page and had the layout of a decent <b>Makefile</b> drawn out mentally.

       At  the end of the next day, I was so far that I actually had the workings of <u>RPM</u> worked out, constructed
       a .rpm-package and a .src.rpm-package,  which  was  promptly  released  on  my  home-page,  announced  on
       freshmeat and uploaded to metalab (apps/misc :-).

       Response was quick and plentiful. By now, I have compilation reports from Linux, FreeBSD and SCO Unixware
       7; there are a few compatibility issues to put aside, but it works surprisingly well.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hodie</b> returns zero. Always. If it doesn't, then something is <b>really</b> bad with the code.

       For some really unreadable code, this means that <b>hodie</b> could be used as a strange replacement for <b>true</b>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       It doesn't sanity check the input... telling <b>hodie</b> to display the roman form of the 99th of march gives a
       slightly jumbled output, which most definitely does not make sense.

       Reports are more than welcome (e-mail below).

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       Now,  who  would  come  up  with  such a thing?  Well, I'm Mikael Johansson, a rather all-round geek from
       Stockholm. I'm gravely interested in languages, in computers  and  in  mathematics;  a  combination  more
       dangerous than you might think.
