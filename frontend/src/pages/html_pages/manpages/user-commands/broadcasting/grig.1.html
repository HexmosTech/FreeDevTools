</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       grig - graphical user interface for the Ham Radio Control Libraries (hamlib)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>grig</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Grig is a simple Ham Radio control (CAT) program based on the Ham Radio Control Libraries. It is intended
       to  be  highly generic presenting the user to the same graphical user interface regardless of which radio
       is being controlled.

       Grig does not store any radio configuration, instead it takes a number of command line options.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--model</b>=<u>ID</u>
              select radio model number; see <b>--list</b>

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--rig-file</b>=<u>DEVICE</u>
              set device of the radio, eg. /dev/ttyS0

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--speed</b>=<u>BAUD</u>
              set transfer rate (serial port only)

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--civ-addr</b>=<u>ID</u>
              set CI-V address (decimal, ICOM only)

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--set-conf</b>=<u>par=val[,par2=val2]</u>
              set additional configuration parameters

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>=<u>LEVEL</u>
              set hamlib debug level (0..5)

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--delay</b>=<u>VALUE</u>
              set delay between commands in msec (see below)

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--nothread</b>
              use timeout calls instead of thread (see below)

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
              list supported radios and exit

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--enable-ptt</b>
              enable ptt control

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--enable-pwr</b>
              enable power status control

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              show a brief help message and exit

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
              show version information and exit

       <b>Example:</b> Start grig using YAESU FT-990 connected to the first serial port,  using  4800  baud  and  debug
       level set to warning:

            grig -m 1016 -r /dev/ttyS0 -s 4800 -d 3

       or if you prefer the long options:

            grig --model=1016 --rig-file=/dev/ttyS0 --speed=4800 --debug=3

       It is usually enough to specify the model ID and the DEVICE.

       If  you  start  grig  without  any  options  it  will  use the Dummy backend and set the debug level to 0
       (RIG_DEBUG_NONE). If you do not specify the transfer rate for the serial port, the default  serial  speed
       will  be used by the backend and even if you specify a value, it can be overridden by the backend. If you
       omit the radio device (port) grig will use <u>/dev/ttyS0</u> or <u>localhost</u> if the selected radio is RPC-rig.

</pre><h4><b>DEBUG</b> <b>LEVELS</b></h4><pre>
       0    No debug, keep quiet.
       1    Serious bug.
       2    Error case (e.g. protocol, memory allocation).
       3    Warnings.
       4    Verbose information.
       5    Trace.

       Grig has its own debug message handler, which will manage messages from hamlib  too.   The  messages  are
       printed  to  STDERR  by  default  but  they  can  be redirected to a file.  In bash shell you would write
       something like:

            grig [options] 2&gt; grig.log

       You can then use the Message Window in the View menu to view these messages. The debug  messages  printed
       by  grig  is  formatted  in a structured way with each line containing both time, source and level of the
       message. Each field is separated with ;; so you can also import the log file  into  a  spread  sheet  for
       further analysis.

</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       Grig  0.9.0  supports  the most commonly used CAT command implemented by hamlib. These include frequency,
       mode, filter and various level settings. Please note that not all features have  been  thoroughly  tested
       since I don't have access to any modern high-end radios. Therefore, comments regarding success or failure
       in using grig will be highly appreciated.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Buffer Overflow in Radio
              By  default,  grig tries to execute rig commands as fast as possible in order to achieve an almost
              real-time remote control experience. This strategy has turned out  to  cause  problems  with  some
              radios,  probably  because  these  radios  acknowledge the reception of a command before executing
              them, whereby the next command will be sent before the previous one has terminated. To  avoid  any
              possible  buffer  overflow  in  these situations, one can try to experiment with the -D or --delay
              command line argument, which will put the specified delay in between each  executed  command.  The
              default  value  is  10  milliseconds  and  the  smallest  possible  value is 1 millisecond (if one
              specifies 0 millisecond on the command line, the default value will be used).  If you find a value
              which is better for your radio than the default value, please let us know about it.

       Daemon Never Starts on FreeBSD
              There have been reports on that the new, thread-based daemon process is never started on  FreeBSD,
              while  the  old, timeout-based daemon worked fine. It is therefore possible to choose the two ways
              to run the daemon process. The default is the new thread based daemon, but if you use FreeBSD  and
              nothing  seems  to  work  after  start-up  you  can select the timeout-based daemon with the -n or
              --nothread command line option.

       Connection Settings
              Once you have started grig you can not change the radio settings (model, device, speed). You  will
              have to restart the program if you want to change any of these settings.

       Multiple Radios
              Grig  can  control only one radio at the time. There are, however, no problems in starting several
              instances of grig as long as they do not try to control the same radio. An exception  to  this  is
              the  RPC-rig backend in which case the rpc rig daemon will act as a server while grig or any other
              hamlib frontends will act as a clients.

       Power OFF State
              On some radios, grig does not cope very well with the power off state. It is yet not known whether
              this is a bug in the hamlib backend or in grig and we will definitely appreciate your input.   The
              situation  gets  even more complicated due to the fact that different radios behave in a different
              ways when they are powered OFF; some of them will continue to respond to  remote  commands,  while
              others will not. Even the same radio, like the FT-817, can behave differently depending on whether
              it is powered from internal batteries or external power supply.  Grig tries to handle this mess by
              suspending  all  rig  commands while in power OFF state. Only the power ON command will be sent to
              the rig.  By default, the power status control is disabled and must explicitly  be  enabled  using
              the -P or --enable-pwr command line switch.

       PTT Control
              Similar to the power state, the PTT has caused strange behaviour on some radios.  Consequently, it
              has  been  disabled  by  default  but  can  be  enabled  using the -p or --enable-ptt command line
              arguments.
