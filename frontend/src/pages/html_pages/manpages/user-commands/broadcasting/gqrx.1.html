</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gqrx - Software Defined Radio GUI application

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Gqrx  is  a  software defined radio (SDR) receiver implemented using GNU Radio and the Qt GUI toolkit. It
       works with hardware supported by gr-osmosdr, including Funcube Dongle, RTL-SDR, Airspy, HackRF,  BladeRF,
       RFSpace, USRP and SoapySDR.

       Gqrx  can operate as an AM/FM/SSB receiver with audio output or as an FFT-only instrument. There are also
       various hooks for interacting with external applications using network sockets.

       It is strongly recommended to run the volk_profile utility before running  gqrx.  This  will  detect  and
       enable processor-specific optimisations and will in many cases give a significant performance boost.

       The  first  time  you  start gqrx it will open a device configuration dialog.  Supported devices that are
       connected to the computer are discovered automatically and you can select any of them  in  the  drop-down
       list.

       If you don't see your device listed in the drop-down list it could be because:

       •      The driver has not been included in a binary distribution

       •      The udev rule has not been properly configured

       •      Linux kernel driver is blocking access to the device

       You  can  test  your  device  using  device specific tools, such as rtl_test, airspy_rx, hackrf_transfer,
       qthid, etc.

       Gqrx supports multiple configurations and sessions if you have several devices or if you want to use  the
       same  device  under  different  configurations. You can load a configuration from the GUI or using the -c
       command line argument.
