</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tkgate - Tcl/Tk based digital circuit editor and simulator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tkgate</b> [-xqs] [-X script] [-l file] [-p file] [-P printer] [files...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>TkGate</u>  is  a  graphical  editor  and  event  driven  simulator  for digital circuits with a tcl/tk-based
       interface. Supported circuit elements include basic gates  (AND,  OR,  etc.),  tri-state  gates,  adders,
       multipliers,  registers, memories and mos transistors. Hierarchical design is also supported with support
       for user defined modules. Save files are based on the Verilog netlist format.

       TkGate documentation can be found at:

       https://bitbucket.org/starling13/tkgate

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options are as follows:

       -X script      Automatically start the simulator and execute the specified simulation script.

       -p file        Print circuit to file without starting GUI.

       -P printer     Print circuit to printer without starting GUI.

       -l file        Read the specified file as a library.

       -x             Automatically start the simulator.

       -q             Suppress startup messages.

       -s             Excute with a synchronous X server connection. This option is primarily for debugging.

       -L lang        Specify a locality to use if tkgate has been configued for Japanese support. The  locality
                      should be either "ASCII" for English, or "ja_JP.EUC" for Japanese. This option can also be
                      set via the LANG environment variable.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>CREDITS</b></h4><pre>
       TkGate  begin  life as an undergraduate project at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 1987. At that time
       it was called simply 'gate' and ran under the 'wm' window manager, a windowing system  developed  at  CMU
       before  X11  was  widely  used.  In this incarnation it was used by students in the computer architecture
       course at CMU to develop a simple microprocessor (dubbed "The Bat Computer"). After  laying  dormant  for
       several  years,  it  was  resurrected  in  1991  and  ported  to run under X11 with the Xlib API. In this
       incarnation it was used several times by students in the introductory digital logic course, but after the
       author graduated and left CMU, it went into hibernation again. This Tcl/Tk incarnation was begun in 1998.
       While there  is  certainly  some  cruftyness  in  the  implementation  in  places  due  to  the  multiple
       reincarnations,  many new features have been added since the older wm and X11 versions, and the interface
       has been made much easier to use.
