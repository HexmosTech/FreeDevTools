</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mincblob - calculate blobs from minc deformation grids

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mincblob</b> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;in1&gt;.mnc

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>mincblob</u>  will  calculate  simple  statistical  metrics  of a minc deformation grid file related to local
       volume change. The input deformation grid files are typically produced by minctracc.

       There are currently 4 deformation grid metrics  to  choose  from:  trace,  determinant,  translation  and
       magnitude.  The  first two relate to different estimates of local volume change the third is a measure of
       how consistent movement is in a direction but without a local change in volume. The  last  calcuates  the
       magnitude  of  the  local  deformation vector. These metrics are all calculated with respect to a vectors
       immediate neighbours. No smoothing of the field is performed as part of this calculation so if  a  smooth
       results is desired input grid files should be first smoothed or blurred.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Note  that  options  can  be  specified in abbreviated form (as long as they are unique) and can be given
       anywhere on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>General</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-clobber</b>
              Overwrite an existing file.

       <b>-noclobber</b>
              Don't overwrite an existing file (default).

       <b>-verbose</b>
              Print out extra information (more than the default).

              <b>-trace</b> Compute the areas within the deformation field that equate to volume increase  or  decrease
              (+ve  or  -ve  dilation)  Dilation is defined as the trace of the deformation field Thus it should
              range between -1..1 with -1 being compression and 1 being dilation. This  measure  while  fast  is
              essentially a sum of partial derivatives in all three directions.

       <b>-determinant</b>
              This  computes the same metric as -trace but with greater accuracy as the local Jacobian matrix is
              first estimated. The first order determinant of the Jacobian is then returned.

       <b>-translation</b>
              Compute the areas within the deformation field that equate to translation Translation  is  defined
              as: trans = arccos( A.B / |A|.|B| ) * e^- (|A|-|B|) Thus it should range between 0..1 with 1 being
              "translation".

       <b>-magnitude</b>
              Compute the magnitude of the local deformation vector.

</pre><h4><b>Generic</b> <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>commands:</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-help</b>  Print summary of command-line options and exit.

       <b>-version</b>
              Print the program's version number and exit.
