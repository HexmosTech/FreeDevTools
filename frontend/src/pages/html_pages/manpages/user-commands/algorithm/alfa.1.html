</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>alfa</b> - automated line fitting algorithm

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>alfa</b> [<u>OPTION</u>] [<u>VALUE</u>]... [<u>FILE</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>alfa</b> rapidly fits emission line spectra, using a genetic algorithm to optimise fitting parameters.  It is
       intended  to  be  entirely automated, but while the default values should work well in many situations, a
       good fit to your observed spectrum may require some adjustments to the input parameters.  It is optimised
       for optical spectra, but can be applied to any wavelength range if a suitable line catalogue is provided.

       <b>alfa</b> reads one dimensional spectra in either plain text or FITS format.  Plain text input should  consist
       of  two columns, giving wavelength and flux.  It can also read data cubes and row-stacked spectra in FITS
       format.  Results are written out in plain text, to  files  containing  the  fit  (total  fit,  continuum-
       subtracted original, continuum, sky lines and residuals), and the line flux measurements.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b,</b> <b>--bad-data</b> <b>[REAL]</b>
              If  all values in a spectrum are below the value specified, <b>alfa</b> will not fit it.  Most useful for
              avoiding wasting time on low signal regions of data cubes.

       <b>--citation</b>
              Prints out the bibliographic details of the paper to cite if you use <b>alfa</b> in your research.

       <b>-cl,</b> <b>--clobber</b>
              <b>alfa</b>'s default behaviour is that it will not overwrite  any  pre-existing  output  file.  If  this
              option is specified, then the output file will be overwritten.

       <b>--collapse</b>
              Sums all spectra in multi-dimensional FITS files into a single spectrum.  Spectra whose peak value
              is below any value specified with the <b>--bad-data</b> option are excluded.  <b>--collapse</b> has no effect on
              1D data.

       <b>-cw,</b> <b>--continuum-window</b> <b>[INTEGER]</b>
              ALFA's  continuum  fitting  takes  the  25th  percentile  of  flux  values  in  a moving window as
              representative of the continuum level. This option can be used to set the size of the window.  The
              value must be an odd integer. Default: 101

       <b>-dl,</b> <b>--detection-limit</b> <b>[REAL]</b>
              Sets  the factor by which a line's flux must exceed the locally estimated noise level for it to be
              considered a detection.  Default: 3.0

       <b>-el,</b> <b>--exclude-line</b> <b>[REAL]</b>
              When reading in the line catalogues, any wavelengths indicated with this option will  be  ignored.
              For  example,  if  H  alpha  were saturated, it could be excluded from the fit with --exclude-line
              6562.77.  Any number of lines can be  excluded  by  repeating  the  option  with  the  appropriate
              wavelengths.

       <b>-fc,</b> <b>--flux-column</b> <b>[INTEGER]</b>
              When reading FITS tables, this option can be used to specify in which table column the flux values
              are. For any other file type it will have no effect. Default: 2

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--generations</b> <b>[INTEGER]</b>
              The number of generations used in the genetic algorithm. Default: 500

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--normalise</b> <b>[VALUE]</b>
              Normalise to Hb=100 assuming that F(Hb)=<u>VALUE</u>.  If <u>VALUE</u> is zero, no normalisation is applied.  If
              this  option  is  not  specified,  fluxes  are  normalised using the measured value of Hb if it is
              detected, and not normalised otherwise.

       <b>-nc,</b> <b>--no-continuum</b>
              In case the spectrum you are fitting is already continuum subtracted, setting  this  option  skips
              <b>alfa</b>'s continuum fitting.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--output-dir</b> <b>[DIRECTORY]</b>
              The directory in which to put the output files. Default: current working directory.

       <b>-of,</b> <b>--output-format</b> <b>[VALUE]</b>
              The  format of the output files. Valid values are text, csv, fits, latex. If you are using <b>alfa</b> in
              conjunction with <b>neat</b>, plain text and fits formats can currently be read in. Default: text

       <b>-pr,</b> <b>--pressure</b> <b>[REAL]</b>
              The fraction of the population retained from each generation. The product of the pressure and  the
              population size should be an integer.  Default: 0.3

       <b>-ps,</b> <b>--populationsize</b> <b>[INTEGER]</b>
              The size of the population used in the genetic algorithm. Default: 30

       <b>-rb,</b> <b>--rebin</b> <b>[INTEGER]</b>
              Rebin  the  input  spectrum by the specified factor. Useful for high resolution spectra where line
              profiles are not instrumental but kinematic. This option is  currently  only  implemented  for  1d
              spectra.

       <b>-rg,</b> <b>--resolution-guess</b> <b>[VALUE]</b>
              Initial  guess  for the resolution [lambda/delta lambda]. Default: estimated using the sampling of
              the input spectrum, assuming that it is Nyquist sampled.

       <b>-rtol1,</b> <b>--resolution-tolerance-1</b> <b>[VALUE]</b>
              Variation allowed in resolution in first pass. Default: equal to 0.9 x resolution guess.

       <b>-rtol2,</b> <b>--resolution-tolerance-2</b> <b>[VALUE]</b>
              Variation allowed in resolution in second pass. Default: 500.

       <b>-skyc,</b> <b>--sky-catalogue;</b> <b>-sc,</b> <b>--strong-catalogue;</b> <b>-dc,</b> <b>--deep-catalogue</b> <b>[FILENAME]</b>
              The files containing the line catalogues to be used for the removal of sky lines,  the  estimation
              of  velocity  and  resolution,  and  the  full line fitting.  The default catalogues are stored in
              /usr/share/alfa .  If you wish to create your own catalogue, the required format is that each line
              should be 85 characters wide, with a  wavelength  in  the  first  column,  and  the  rest  of  the
              characters  are  not  used  by the code but are transferred to the output files.  They can thus be
              used, as in the supplied catalogues, for line transition data.  To use the default catalogues  but
              exclude some lines, the <b>--exclude-line</b> option can be used.

       <b>-ss,</b> <b>--subtract-sky</b>
              Fit and subtract night sky emission lines before fitting nebular emission lines.

       <b>-ul,</b> <b>--upper-limits</b>
              Write  out upper limits for all lines searched for and not detected. The upper limit is calculated
              as the detection limit (default 3, set by --detection-limit) multiplied  by  the  uncertainty.  In
              FITS  output,  this  option  is  ignored  - all upper limits are written out, and are indicated by
              negative flux values. If the FITS file is later anaysed  with  <b>neat</b>,  these  negative  values  are
              simply ignored.

       <b>-vg,</b> <b>--velocity-guess</b> <b>[VALUE]</b>
              Initial guess for the velocity of the object [km/s]. Default: 0.

       <b>-vtol1,</b> <b>--velocity-tolerance-1</b> <b>[VALUE]</b>
              Variation allowed in velocity in first pass of the fitting. Default: 900km/s

       <b>-vtol2,</b> <b>--velocity-tolerance-2</b> <b>[VALUE]</b>
              Variation allowed in velocity in second pass of the fitting. Default: 60km/s

       <b>-wc,</b> <b>--wavelength-column</b> <b>[INTEGER]</b>
              When  reading FITS tables, this option can be used to specify in which table column the wavelength
              values are. For any other file type it will have no effect. Default: 1

       <b>-ws,</b> <b>--wavelength-scaling</b> <b>[VALUE]</b>
              <b>alfa</b> checks the units of FITS file headers to set the wavelength  scale,  defaulting  to  assuming
              Angstroms  if  no keyword is present.  If your input spectrum is not in Angstroms, use this option
              to set the value by which wavelengths should be multiplied to convert them to A.  For example, -ws
              10.0 would apply if your spectra have wavelengths in nm.

</pre><h4><b>ALGORITHM</b></h4><pre>
       <b>alfa</b> works in three stages.  First, it estimates and subtracts the continuum.  Second, it  estimates  the
       resolution  of the spectra and the velocity of the object.  And third, it fits the emission lines.  These
       stages work as follows:

       <b>Continuum</b> <b>subtraction</b>

              <b>alfa</b> estimates the continuum using a percentile filter, taking the 25th  percentile  in  a  moving
              window 101 pixels wide.  Currently these values are hard-coded, but will be user-configurable in a
              future  release.  Regions such as the Balmer and Paschen jumps may be poorly fitted by this method
              if the spectral resolution is low and the continuum gradient  is  changing  fast.   Broad  stellar
              emission  lines  and  telluric  absorption  features  may  also not be well fitted by this method.
              Inspection of the fitted continuum is recommended.

       <b>Estimation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> <b>velocity</b>

              If no relevant command line options are specified, <b>alfa</b> begins by assuming that  the  velocity  of
              the  object  is  zero,  and  that the spectrum is Nyquist-sampled.  It then carries out a fit on a
              subset of strong lines, using the genetic algorithm described below, to obtain an overall estimate
              for the velocity and the resolution.  If necessary, the initial guesses can be specified with  the
              <b>-vg</b>  and <b>-rg</b> options described above, and the parameter space for the fine tuning can be specified
              with <b>-vtol1</b> and <b>-rtol1</b>.

       <b>Fitting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b>

              With the continuum subtracted and the resolution and velocity estimated, <b>alfa</b> divides the spectrum
              up into chunks 440 pixels wide, with 20 pixels at either end  overlapping  with  adjacent  chunks.
              Then the genetic algorithm fits all lines from the deep catalogue that fall within the central 400
              pixels,  with  the  overlap regions providing the full line profile for lines close to the edge of
              the chunk.  The initial guess for the resolution and velocity are taken from the  global  estimate
              for the first chunk, and from the preceding chunk's fine tuned value for all succeeding chunks.

              With  the  parameters  optimised  in  each  chunk, uncertainties are estimated using the root mean
              square of the residuals in a 20 pixel window, exlucing  the  two  largest  residuals  to  mitigate
              against overestimated uncertainties in the neighbourhood of bad pixels or strong lines.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>alfa</b>  can  read  either plain text files or FITS format files.  For plain text, the file should contain a
       wavelength and a flux, with the wavelength in  the  same  units  as  the  line  catalogues  (the  default
       catalogues  have  wavelengths in Angstroms).  FITS files are read using the CFITSIO library, so any FITS-
       compliant file should be fine.  However, a surprisingly large fraction of all FITS files  do  not  comply
       with the standard, so in case of problems, trying using <b>fitsverify</b> to check your FITS file.

       The  FITS  file can have one, two or three dimensions.  If it has two, it is assumed to be in Row-Stacked
       Spectra (RSS) format, while if it has three, it is assumed to be a data cube with two  axes  representing
       spatial dimensions and the third representing the spectral dimension.

       If  you  don't  want  to fit the whole dataset, you can specify the range of pixels on each axis that you
       want <b>alfa</b> to read in by appending the filename with  [<u>startx:endx,starty:endy</u>].   This  functionality  is
       part      of      the      CFITSIO      library,      and      the     format     is     described     at
       https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/c/c_user/node97.html.  <b>alfa</b> itself does  not  read  in
       the coordinates of the section, and so the output file numbering starts from 1 on each axis regardless of
       where  the image section actually started.  The next release of <b>alfa</b> will have improved support for image
       sections.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>alfa</b> can produce output in plain text, csv, latex or FITS format. FITS is  the  default  and  recommended
       format; in future releases, output formats other than FITS will be deprecated and eventually removed.

       When  producing  plain text, csv or latex output, <b>alfa</b> will produce two files, a fit file and a line list
       file. When producing FITS format, a single file is created, with  three  extensions,  for  the  fit,  the
       linelist,  and a third extension containing the Hbeta flux, number of lines detected, the radial velocity
       and average resolution over the spectrum. Output filenames are based on  the  input  filename,  with  the
       extensions noted below.

       <b>The</b> <b>fit</b> <b>file</b> <b>(_fit.txt,</b> <b>_fit.csv,</b> <b>_fit.tex)</b> <b>or</b> <b>extension</b> <b>(.fits):</b>

              The  fit  file  contains  the  best  fitting  synthesised  spectrum.   It  contains seven columns,
              representing the wavelength, the input spectrum, the fitted spectrum, the original after continuum
              subtraction, the estimated continuum, the fluxes of sky lines, and the residuals.   Thus,  to  see
              the  fitted  spectrum, you need to plot columns 1 and 3 of this file.  In gnuplot, one can compare
              the input and fitted spectra using this command:
                  plot 'filename_fit' w l, 'filename_fit' using 1:3 w l

       <b>The</b> <b>lines</b> <b>file</b> <b>(_lines.txt,</b> <b>_lines.csv,</b> <b>_lines.tex)</b> <b>or</b> <b>extension</b> <b>(.fits):</b>

              This file contains four columns with parameters of the fitted lines - the observed wavelength, the
              rest wavelength, the flux, and the uncertainty estimated from the residuals.   This  file  can  be
              read  directly  by  <b>neat</b>, which determines abundances for photoionised nebulae. If latex format is
              requested, the file additionally contains atomic data details not currently available in the other
              formats.

              For RSS files and data cubes, <b>alfa</b> currently produces output for each pixel.  Thus,  for  a  large
              data  cube  you  may  end up with tens of thousands of files in the output directory. A routine to
              combine these outputs into image maps will be provided in a future release of <b>alfa</b>.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>alfa</b>'s default parameters are supposed to work in most cases, but sometimes you might find that  it  does
       not  converge  on  the  correct  wavelength  solution.  It searches initially for velocities in the range
       +/-900km/s, which is very large for Galactic objects.  So, running the code with <b>--resolution-tolerance-1</b>
       <b>100.</b> or so may improve your results.

       The genetic parameters (population size, number of generations, pressure) are likely to be  suitable  for
       most  cases.   There is no algorithm yet known for optimising these parameters in a genetic algorithm, so
       changing them requires trial and error.  In spectra of regions with  lots  of  emission  lines,  such  as
       4000-4500 Angstrom, increasing the number of generations can result in a better fit.

   <b>Error</b> <b>codes</b>
       If <b>alfa</b> encounters an error it will return one of the following status codes:

        100 incomplete or invalid command line option
        101 input file does not exist
        102 output directory does not exist
        103 error opening FITS file
        104 no axes found in input file
        105 too many axes found in input file
        106 error reading FITS keywords
        107 error writing FITS output
        108 no line catalogue file specified
        109 line catalogue not found

        200 all fluxes below baddata limit
        201 no known emission lines in wavelength range
        202 failed to estimate velocity and resolution - no lines found
