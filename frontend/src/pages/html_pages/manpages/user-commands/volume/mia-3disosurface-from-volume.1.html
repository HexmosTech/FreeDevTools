</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mia-3disosurface-from-volume</b>  This  program  is  used to extract an iso-surface from the input gray scale
       image by using marching thetrahedra.

                     to volume-optimized

              -w --reverse-winding
                     reverse  the  winding  of  the  triangles in order to make normals point away from the high

   <b>Processing</b>
                 --threads=-1
                     Maxiumum number of threads to use for processing,This number should be lower  or  equal  to
