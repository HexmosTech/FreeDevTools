       hmount - introduce a new HFS volume and make it current

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       hmount <u>source-path</u> [<u>partition-no</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hmount</b>  is  used to introduce a new HFS volume. A UNIX pathname to the volume's source must be specified.
       The source may be a block device or a regular file containing an HFS volume image.

       If the source medium is partitioned, one partition must be selected to be mounted. If there is  only  one
       HFS partition on the medium, it will be selected by default. Otherwise, the desired partition number must
       be  specified (as the ordinal <u>n</u>th HFS partition) on the command-line. Partition number <b>0</b> can be specified
       to refer to the entire medium, ignoring what might otherwise be perceived as a partition map, although in
       practice this is probably only useful if you want this command to fail when the medium is partitioned.

       The mounted volume becomes "current" so subsequent commands  will  refer  to  it.   The  current  working
       directory  for  the  volume  is  set to the root of the volume.  This information is kept in a file named
       <u>.hcwd</u> in the user's home directory.

       If the source medium is changed (e.g. floppy or CD-ROM disc exchanged)  after  <b>hmount</b>  has  been  called,
       subsequent  HFS  commands  will  fail until the original medium is replaced or a different volume is made
       current. To use the same source path with the different medium, reissue the <b>hmount</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       % hmount /dev/fd0
              If a Macintosh floppy disk is available as <b>/dev/fd0</b>, this command makes  the  floppy  current  for
              other HFS commands such as <a href="../man1/hls.1.html">hls</a>(1), <a href="../man1/hcd.1.html">hcd</a>(1), <a href="../man1/hcopy.1.html">hcopy</a>(1), etc.

       % hmount /dev/sd2 1
              If  a SCSI disk is available as <b>/dev/sd2</b>, this command finds the first HFS partition on the medium
              and makes it available for other HFS operations.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hmount</b> does not actually mount an HFS partition over a UNIX directory in the traditional <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a>(8)  sense.
       It  is  merely  a  "virtual" mount, as a point of convenience for future HFS operations. Each HFS command
       independently opens, operates on, and closes the named source path given to <b>hmount</b>.
