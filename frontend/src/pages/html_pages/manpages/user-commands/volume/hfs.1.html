       hfs - shell for manipulating HFS volumes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       hfs [<u>hfs-path</u> [<u>partition-no</u>]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hfs</b>  is  an  interactive  command-oriented  tool  for  manipulating HFS volumes.  <b>hfs</b> is based on the Tcl
       interpreter, so basic Tcl constructs can be used in addition to the following commands:

       <b>mount</b> path [partition-no]
              The specified UNIX path is opened as an HFS volume. If a partition number <u>n</u> is specified  and  the
              volume  source  is  located  on  a  partitioned  medium,  the <u>n</u>th discovered HFS partition will be
              mounted. The default <u>partition-no</u> is 1.

       <b>umount</b> [path]
              The volume previously mounted from the specified path (or the current volume, if  none  specified)
              is unmounted.

       <b>vol</b> path
              The volume previously mounted from the specified path is made current.

       <b>info</b>   General  information  about  the  currently  mounted volume is displayed. This information is also
              displayed automatically when the volume is mounted.

       <b>pwd</b>    The full path to the current working HFS directory is displayed.

       <b>cd</b> [hfs-path]
              The current working directory is changed to the given HFS path. If no path is given,  the  working
              directory is changed to the root of the volume.

       <b>dir</b> [hfs-path]
              A directory listing of the specified HFS directory is displayed. If no path is given, the contents
              of the current working directory are shown.

       <b>mkdir</b> hfs-path
              A new, empty directory is created with the specified path.

       <b>rmdir</b> hfs-path
              The specified directory is removed. It must be empty.

       <b>create</b> hfs-path [type [creator]]
              An empty file is created with the specified path. The Macintosh type and creator may be specified,
              or they will default to <b>TEXT</b> and <b>UNIX</b>, respectively.

       <b>del</b> hfs-path
              Both forks of the specified file are deleted.

       <b>stat</b> hfs-path
              Status information about the specified HFS path-identified entity is displayed.

       <b>cat</b> hfs-path
              The data fork of the specified HFS file is displayed.

       <b>copyin</b> unix-path [hfs-path [mode]]
              The  specified  UNIX file is copied to the named HFS destination path. Unless specified otherwise,
              the file will be copied into the current HFS working directory using a heuristically chosen  mode.
              The <u>mode</u> may be one of: <b>macb</b> (MacBinary II), <b>binh</b> (BinHex), <b>text</b>, or <b>raw</b>.

       <b>copyout</b> hfs-path [unix-path [mode]]
              The specified HFS file is copied into the named UNIX destination path. Unless specified otherwise,
              the file will be copied into the current UNIX working directory using a heuristically chosen mode.
              The modes are the same as for <b>copyin</b>.

       <b>format</b> path [partition-no [volume-name]]
              The specified UNIX path is initialized as an empty HFS volume with the given name, and this volume
              is subsequently mounted. The default volume name is <b>Untitled</b>.

       The shell is scriptable, however it should be understood that the above commands are actually implemented
       by  Tcl  procedures  prefixed  with  the  character  "h",  e.g. hmount, hcd, etc., in order to avoid name
       collisions with other Tcl utilities. The "h" may be omitted in interactive use for convenience.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cat</b> can only display the data fork of a file. Text translations  are  performed  unconditionally  on  the
       output.  Furthermore,  binary data cannot be handled properly from within Tcl scripts since the character
       with value 0 cannot be represented in Tcl strings. Use <b>copyout</b> to copy files without these limitations.
