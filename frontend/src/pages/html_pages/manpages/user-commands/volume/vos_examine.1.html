</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>vos</b> <b>examine</b> command formats and displays information from the Volume Location Database (VLDB) entry
       and the volume header of the volume specified by the <b>-id</b> argument.

       To display the volume header only, use the <b>vos</b> <b>listvol</b> command. To display information from the VLDB
       only, use the <b>vos</b> <b>listvldb</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>CAUTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Currently, the maximum quota for a volume is 2 terabytes (2^41 bytes). Note that this only affects the
       volume's quota; a volume may grow much larger if the volume quota is disabled. However, volumes over 2
       terabytes in size may be impractical to move, and may have their size incorrectly reported by some tools,
       such as <b><a href="../man1/fs_listquota.1.html">fs_listquota</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-id</b> &lt;<u>volume</u> <u>name</u> <u>or</u> <u>ID</u>&gt;
           Specifies  either the complete name or volume ID number of the volume, which can be read/write, read-
           only, or backup.

       <b>-extended</b>
           Displays statistics about read and write operations on files and directories in the volume.

       <b>-format</b>
           Shows information in a format suitable for machine parsing.

       <b>-cell</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument with  the  <b>-localauth</b>  flag.
           For more details, see <b><a href="../man1/vos.1.html">vos</a></b>(1).

       <b>-noauth</b>
           Assigns  the  unprivileged  identity  "anonymous"  to  the  issuer. Do not combine this flag with the
           <b>-localauth</b> flag. For more details, see <b><a href="../man1/vos.1.html">vos</a></b>(1).

       <b>-localauth</b>
           Constructs a server ticket using a key from  the  local  <u>/etc/openafs/server/KeyFile</u>  file.  The  <b>vos</b>
           command  interpreter  presents  it  to  the  Volume  Server  and Volume Location Server during mutual
           authentication. Do not combine this flag with the <b>-cell</b> argument or <b>-noauth</b> flag. For  more  details,
           see <b><a href="../man1/vos.1.html">vos</a></b>(1).

       <b>-verbose</b>
           Produces  on the standard output stream a detailed trace of the command's execution. If this argument
           is omitted, only warnings and error messages appear.

       <b>-encrypt</b>
           Encrypts the command so that the operation's results are not transmitted across the network in  clear
           text. This option is available in OpenAFS versions 1.4.11 or later and 1.5.60 or later.

       <b>-noresolve</b>
           Shows  all  servers  as  IP  addresses  instead  of the DNS name. This is very useful when the server
           address is registered as 127.0.0.1 or when dealing with multi-homed servers. This option is available
           in OpenAFS versions 1.4.8 or later and 1.5.35 or later.

       <b>-config</b> &lt;<u>configuration</u> <u>directory</u>&gt;
           Set the location of the configuration directory to be used. This defaults to <u>/etc/openafs</u>, except  if
           <b>-localauth</b> is specified, in which case the default is <u>/etc/openafs/server</u>. This option allows the use
           of alternative configuration locations for testing purposes.

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The  first seven lines of the output show information from the volume header and the remaining lines come
       from the VLDB. Each item in the following list corresponds to a line of output derived  from  the  volume
       header.

       •   Basic information about the specified volume (displayed on a single line):

           •   Name

           •   Volume ID number

           •   Type (the flag is "RW" for read/write, "RO" for read-only, "BK" for backup)

           •   Size in kilobytes (1024 equals a megabyte)

           •   Number of files in the volume, if the <b>-extended</b> flag is provided

           •   Status on the file server machine, which is one of the following:

               On-line
                   The volume is completely accessible to Cache Managers.

               Off-line
                   The  volume  is  not  accessible  to  Cache Managers, but does not seem to be corrupted. This
                   status appears while a volume is being dumped, for example.

               Off-line**needs salvage**
                   The volume is not accessible to Cache Managers, because it seems to be corrupted. Use the <b>bos</b>
                   <b>salvage</b> or <b>salvager</b> command to repair the corruption.

       •   The file server machine and partition that house the volume, as determined by the command interpreter
           as the command runs, rather than derived from the VLDB or the volume header.

       •   The volume ID numbers associated with the various versions  of  the  volume:  read/write  ("RWrite"),
           read-only  ("ROnly"),  backup ("Backup"), and ReleaseClone ("RClone"). One of them matches the volume
           ID number that appears on the first line of the volume's  output.  If  the  value  in  the  "RWrite",
           "ROnly",  or  "Backup"  field  is 0 (zero), there is no volume of that type. If there is currently no
           ReleaseClone, the "RClone" field does not appear at all.

       •   The maximum space quota allotted to the read/write copy of the volume, expressed in  kilobyte  blocks
           in the "MaxQuota" field.

       •   The  date  and  time the volume was created, in the "Creation" field. If the volume has been restored
           with the <b>backup</b> <b>diskrestore</b>, <b>backup</b> <b>volrestore</b>, or <b>vos</b> <b>restore</b> command, this is the restore time. For
           a read-only volume, this is the last release time.

       •   The date and time this copy of this volume was created, in the "Copy" field.  This is the  time  when
           the  volume  was created on this server and partition.  For read-only volumes, it is not updated by a
           release (unlike the Creation date).  The copy date is not stored in volume dumps.

       •   The date and time when the contents of the volume last changed, in the "Last Update" field. For read-
           only and backup volumes, it matches the timestamp in the "Creation" field.

       •   The number of times the volume has been accessed for a fetch or store operation since  the  later  of
           the two following times:

           •   12:00 a.m. on the day the command is issued

           •   The last time the volume changed location

       When the <b>-extended</b> flag is included, two tables appear next:

       •   The  table  labeled  "Raw Read/Write Stats" contains information on the number of reads (fetches) and
           writes (stores) made on the specified volume.

       •   The table labeled "Writes Affecting Authorship" contains information on  writes  made  to  files  and
           directories in the specified volume.

       If the following message appears instead of the previously listed information, it indicates that a volume
       is  not accessible to Cache Managers or the <b>vos</b> command interpreter, for example because a clone is being
       created.

          **** Volume &lt;volume_ID&gt; is busy ****

       If the following message appears instead of the previously listed information, it indicates that the File
       Server is unable to attach the volume, perhaps  because  it  is  seriously  corrupted.  The  <u>FileLog</u>  and
       <u>VolserLog</u>  log  files  in  the  <u>/var/log/openafs</u>  directory  on  the file server machine possibly provide
       additional information; use the <b>bos</b> <b>getlog</b> command to display them.

          **** Could not attach volume &lt;volume_ID&gt; ****

       Following a blank line, information from the VLDB entry appears.  Each item in this list corresponds to a
       separate line in the output:

       •   The base (read/write) volume name. The read-only and backup  versions  have  the  same  name  with  a
           ".readonly" and ".backup" extension, respectively.

       •   The  volume ID numbers allocated to the versions of the volume that actually exist, in fields labeled
           "RWrite" for the read/write, "ROnly" for the read-only, "Backup" for the backup, and "RClone" for the
           ReleaseClone. (If a field does not appear, the corresponding version of the volume does  not  exist.)
           The  appearance  of  the  "RClone" field normally indicates that a release operation did not complete
           successfully; the "Old release" and "New release" flags often also appear on one or more of the  site
           definition lines described just following.

       •   The  number  of  sites  that house a read/write or read-only copy of the volume, following the string
           "number of sites -&gt;".

       •   A line for each site that houses a read/write or read-only copy of the volume,  specifying  the  file
           server  machine,  partition,  and  type  of  volume ("RW" for read/write or "RO" for read-only). If a
           backup version exists, it is understood to share the read/write site.  Several flags can appear  with
           a site definition:

           Not released
               Indicates that the vos release command has not been issued since the <b>vos</b> <b>addsite</b> command was used
               to define the read-only site.

           Old release
               Indicates  that  a  vos  release  command  did  not  complete successfully, leaving the previous,
               obsolete version of the volume at this site.

           New release
               Indicates that a vos release command did not  complete  successfully,  but  that  this  site  did
               receive the correct new version of the volume.

       •   If  the  VLDB entry is locked, the string "Volume is currently LOCKED", as well as (in OpenAFS 1.5.75
           and later) one or more of the following strings:

           Volume is locked for a move operation
               Indicates that the volume was locked due to a <b>vos</b> <b>move</b> or a <b>vos</b> <b>convertROtoRW</b> command.

           Volume is locked for a release operation
               Indicates that the volume was locked due to a <b>vos</b> <b>release</b> command.

           Volume is locked for a backup operation
               Indicates that the volume was locked due to a <b>vos</b> <b>backup</b> command.

           Volume is locked for a delete/misc operation
               Indicates that the volume was locked due to  a  <b>vos</b>  <b>delentry</b>,  <b>vos</b>  <b>addsite</b>,  <b>vos</b>  <b>remsite</b>,  <b>vos</b>
               <b>changeloc</b>, <b>vos</b> <b>syncvldb</b>, <b>vos</b> <b>syncserv</b>, <b>vos</b> <b>rename</b>, or <b>vos</b> <b>lock</b> command.

           Volume is locked for a dump/restore operation
               Indicates that the volume was locked due to a <b>vos</b> <b>dump</b> or <b>vos</b> <b>restore</b> command.

       For further discussion of the "New release" and "Old release" flags, see <b><a href="../man1/vos_release.1.html">vos_release</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  example  shows  output for the Example Corporation volume called "usr" with two read-only
       replication sites (this volume is mounted  at  the  <u>/afs/example.com/usr</u>  directory).  For  the  sake  of
       illustration, the output shows the volume as locked.

          % vos examine usr

       The  following  example shows the output for the volume "user.terry" using the <b>-extended</b> flag. The volume
       has no read-only replication sites.
