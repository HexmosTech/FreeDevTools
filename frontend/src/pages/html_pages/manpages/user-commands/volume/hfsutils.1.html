       <b>hcd</b> - change working HFS directory
       <b>hcopy</b> - copy files from or to an HFS volume
       <b>hdel</b> - delete both forks of an HFS file
       <b>hdir</b> - display an HFS directory in long format
       <b>hformat</b> - create a new HFS filesystem and make it current
       <b>hls</b> - list files in an HFS directory
       <b>hmkdir</b> - create a new HFS directory
       <b>hmount</b> - introduce a new HFS volume and make it current
       <b>hpwd</b> - print the full path to the current HFS working directory
       <b>hrename</b> - rename or move an HFS file or directory
       <b>hrmdir</b> - remove an empty HFS directory
       <b>humount</b> - remove an HFS volume from the list of known volumes
       <b>hvol</b> - display or change the current HFS volume

       <b>hfssh</b> - Tcl interpreter with HFS extensions

       <b>hfs</b> - shell for manipulating HFS volumes
       <b>xhfs</b> - graphical interface for manipulating HFS volumes

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hfsutils</b>  is  a  collection  of tools and programs for accessing Macintosh HFS-formatted volumes. See the
       accompanying man page for each program above for more information.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       These utilities can manipulate HFS volumes on nearly any medium. A UNIX path is  initially  specified  to
       <b>hmount</b>  or  <b>hformat</b>  which  gives  the  location  of  the  volume.  This  path  can  be a block device --
       corresponding to, for example, a floppy disk, CD-ROM, SCSI disk, or other  device  --  or  it  can  be  a
       regular file containing an image of any of the above.

       The  medium  specified by the UNIX path may or may not contain an Apple partition map. If partitioned, it
       is possible for more than one HFS volume to be present on the medium. In this case,  a  partition  number
       must  also  be  given  which  selects  the  desired  partition. This number refers to the <u>n</u>th ordinal HFS
       partition on the volume. (Other, non-HFS partitions are ignored.)   Partition  number  <b>0</b>  refers  to  the
       entire medium, disregarding the partition map, if any.

       HFS pathnames consist of colon-separated components. Unlike UNIX pathnames, an HFS path which begins with
       a colon (e.g. :Foo:Bar) is a <u>relative</u> path, and one which does not (e.g. Foo:Bar) is an <u>absolute</u> path. As
       sole exception to this rule, a path not containing any colons is assumed to be relative.

       Absolute  pathnames  always  begin  with  the  name  of  the volume itself. Any occurrence of two or more
       consecutive colons in a path causes resolution of the path to ascend into parent directories.

       Most of the command-line programs support HFS filename globbing. The  following  forms  of  globbing  are
       supported:

       <b>*</b>      matches zero or more characters.

       <b>?</b>      matches exactly one character.

       <b>[</b>...<b>]</b>  matches  any  single character enclosed within the brackets. A character range may be specified by
              using a hypen (-). Note that matches are not case sensitive.

       <b>{</b>...<b>,</b>...<b>}</b>
              expands into the Cartesian product of each specified substring.

       <b>\</b>      causes the following character to be matched literally.

       Note that since globbing is performed by each HFS command rather than by  the  UNIX  shell  (which  knows
       nothing  about  HFS volumes), care should always be taken to protect pathnames from the shell by using an
       appropriate quoting technique. Typically it is best to surround HFS pathnames containing glob  characters
       with single quotes (').

       Time  stamps  on  HFS volumes are interpreted as being relative to the current time zone. This means that
       modification dates on HFS volumes written in another time zone may appear to be off  by  some  number  of
       hours.

       Hardware  limitations  prevent  some  systems from reading or writing native Macintosh 800K floppy disks;
       only high-density 1440K disks can be used on these systems.

       The obsolete MFS volume format is not supported by this software.
