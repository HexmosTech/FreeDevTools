</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dislocker-fuse - Read/write BitLocker encrypted volumes under Linux, OSX and FreeBSD.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       dislocker-fuse [-hqrsv] [-l <u>LOG_FILE</u>] [-O <u>OFFSET</u>] [-V <u>VOLUME</u> <u>DECRYPTMETHOD</u> -F[<u>N</u>]] [-- <u>ARGS</u>...]

       Where  DECRYPTMETHOD  =  {-p[<u>RECOVERY_PASSWORD</u>]  |  -f  <u>BEK_FILE</u>  | -u[<u>USER_PASSWORD</u>] | -k <u>FVEK_FILE</u> | -K
       <u>VMK_FILE</u> | -c}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Given a decryption mean, the program is used to read or write BitLocker encrypted  volumes.  Technically,
       the program will create a virtual NTFS partition that you can mount as any other NTFS partition.

       The virtual partition is linked to the underlying BitLocker volume, so any write to this volume is put on
       the  BitLocker  volume  as  well.  However,  you can use <a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd</a>(1) to get rid of this limitation -- if it's a
       limitation for you. An example is provided in the EXAMPLES section of this man page.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Program's options are described below:

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--clearkey</b>
              decrypt volume using a clear key which is searched on the volume (default)

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--bekfile</b> <u>BEK_FILE</u>
              decrypt volume using the bek file (present on a USB key)

       <b>-F,</b> <b>--force-block=[</b><u>N</u><b>]</b>
              force use of metadata block number <u>N</u> (1, 2 or 3).  Without <u>N</u>, the first block is forced.   Without
              this option, the program will try each block until a valid one is found

       <b>-h</b>     print the help and exit

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--fvek</b> <u>FVEK_FILE</u>
              decrypt  volume using the FVEK directly.  See the FVEK FILE section below to understand what is to
              be put into this <u>FVEK_FILE</u>

       <b>-K,</b> <b>--vmk</b> <u>VMK_FILE</u>
              decrypt volume using the VMK directly.  See the VMK FILE section below to understand what is to be
              put into this <u>VMK_FILE</u>

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--logfile</b> <u>LOG_FILE</u>
              put messages into this file (stdout by default)

       <b>-O,</b> <b>--offset</b> <u>OFFSET</u>
              BitLocker partition offset, in bytes, in base 10 (default is  0).   Protip:  in  your  shell,  you
              probably  can pass <b>-O</b> <b>$((</b><u>0xdeadbeef</u><b>))</b> if you have a 16-based number and are too lazy to convert it
              in another way.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--recovery-password=[</b><u>RECOVERY_PASSWORD</u><b>]</b>
              decrypt volume using the recovery password method.  If no recovery-password is provided,  it  will
              be  asked  afterward; this has the advantage that the program will validate each block one by one,
              on the fly, as you type it and not to leak the password on the commandline

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              do NOT display any information.  This option has priority on any previous `<b>-v</b>'. One probably wants
              to check the return value of the program when using this option

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--readonly</b>
              do not allow one to write on the BitLocker volume (read only mode)

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--stateok</b>
              do not check the volume's state, assume it's ok to mount it.  Do not use this if  you  don't  know
              what you're doing

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--user-password=[</b><u>USER_PASSWORD</u><b>]</b>
              decrypt  the  volume  using the user password method.  If no user-password is provided, it will be
              asked afterward; this has the advantage not to leak the password on the commandline

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbosity</b>
              increase verbosity (CRITICAL level by default), see also `<b>-q</b>'

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--volume</b> <u>VOLUME</u>
              volume to get metadata and encrypted keys from

       <b>--</b>     mark the end of program's options and the beginning of FUSE's ones (useful if  you  want  to  pass
              something like -d to FUSE)

       <b>ARGS</b> are any arguments you want to pass to FUSE. Note that you need to pass at least the mount-point.

</pre><h4><b>FVEK</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The FVEK file option expects a specific format from the file. The file is split into two major parts:
              - 2 bytes describing the encryption in use, from 0x8000 to 0x8003 for AES 128 or 256 bits, with or
              without diffuser.

              - 64 bytes (512 bits) which are the FVEK as in the FVEK key protector once decrypted.

       The file is therefore 66 bytes long, not more nor less.  Note that you may have to deal with endianness.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       These are examples you can run directly.  First, you may want to copy the BitLocker volume:

              <b>%</b> <b>dd</b> <b>if=/dev/sda2</b> <b>of=encrypted.bitlocker</b>

              This will copy the entire volume located into <b>/dev/sda2</b> to <b>encrypted.bitlocker</b>.  You're not forced
              to do this step, but this will ensure no write whatsoever is performed on the BitLocker volume.

       Then dislock it:

              <b>%</b> <b>dislocker</b> <b>-V</b> <b>encrypted.bitlocker</b> <b>-f</b> <b>/path/to/usb/file.BEK</b> <b>--</b> <b>/mnt/ntfs</b>

              This will create a file into <b>/mnt/ntfs</b> named dislocker-file.

       To mount partitions once decrypted, use this sort of line:
              <b>%</b> <b>mount</b> <b>-o</b> <b>loop</b> <b>/mnt/ntfs/dislocker-file</b> <b>/mnt/clear</b>

       --

       It seems that you have to unmount the NTFS partition and the dislocker one before halting the system, or
       you will run into unexpected behaviour. In order to do so, you may run these commands (replacing your
       mount points):
              <b>%</b> <b>umount</b> <b>/mnt/clear</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>umount</b> <b>/mnt/ntfs/dislocker-file</b>

       --

       Note  that these are <b>examples</b> and, as such, may need to be modified. For instance, you may want to change
       the decryption method used in them.
