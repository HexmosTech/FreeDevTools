</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nn - efficient net news interface (No News is good news)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nn</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>newsgroup</u>  |  +<u>folder</u>  |  <u>file</u> ]...
       <b>nn</b> -g [ -r ]
       <b>nn</b> -a0 [ <u>newsgroup</u> ]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Net  news  is a world-wide information exchange service covering numerous topics in science and every day
       life.  Topics are organized in <u>news</u> <u>groups</u>, and these groups are open for everybody to post <u>articles</u> on a
       subject related to the topic of the group.

       <u>Nn</u> is a `point-and-shoot' net news interface program, or a <u>news</u> <u>reader</u> for short (not to be confused with
       the <u>human</u> news reader).  When you use <u>nn</u>, you can decide which of the many news groups you are interested
       in, and you can unsubscribe to those which don't interest you.  <u>nn</u> will let you read the  new  (and  old)
       articles in each of the groups you subscribe to using a menu based article selection prior to reading the
       articles in the news group.

       When  a news group is entered, <u>nn</u> will locate all the presently unread articles in the group, and extract
       their sender, subject, and other relevant information.  This information is then rearranged, sorted,  and
       marked in various ways to give it a pleasant format when it is presented on the screen.

       This  will  be  done very quickly, because <u>nn</u> uses the NOV database via the NNTP <b>XOVER</b> command.  The news
       server to use can be overridden by setting the environment variable <u>$NNTPSERVER</u> to the name of the system
       (such as <b>news.newserver.com</b>), or by setting the variable <u>nntp-server</u> (on the command line only, since  it
       is looked at before the init file), as "nntp-server=news.some.domain").  If you use multiple servers, you
       probably  want  to set the <u>nn-directory</u> and <u>newsrc</u> variables on the command line to an alternate names as
       well, since some of the data files are server dependent.  If you are using a slow tcp link (such  as  <u>ppp</u>
       over a modem) and <b>NNTP</b>, see the <b>NOTES</b> section at the end of this manual.

       When  the  article menu appears on the screen, <u>nn</u> will be in a mode called <b>selection</b> <b>mode</b>.  In this mode,
       the articles which seems to be interesting can be selected by single keystrokes (using the keys  a-z  and
       0-9).  When all the interesting articles among the ones presently displayed have been selected, the space
       bar is hit, which causes <u>nn</u> to enter reading mode.

       In  <b>reading</b> <b>mode</b>, each of the selected articles will be presented.  You use the <b>space</b> <b>bar</b> to go on to the
       next page of the current article, or to the next article.  Of course, there are all sorts of commands  to
       scroll  text  up and down, skip to the next article, responding to an article, decrypt an article, and so
       on.

       When all the selected articles in the current group have been read, the last hit on the  space  bar  will
       cause <u>nn</u> will continue to the next group with unread articles, and enter selection mode on that group.

</pre><h4><b>FREQUENTLY</b> <b>USED</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>nn</u>  accepts  a  lot  of  command  line  options, but here only the frequently used options are described.
       Options can also be set permanently by including appropriate <u>variable</u> settings in the <u>init</u> file described
       later.  All options are described in the section on Command Line Options towards the end of this manual.

       The frequently used command line options are:

       -<b>a0</b>    Catch up on unread articles and groups.  See the section "Catch up" below.

       -<b>g</b>     Prompt for the name of a news group or folder to be entered (with completion).

       -<b>r</b>     Used with -<b>g</b> to repeatedly prompt for groups to enter.

       -<b>l</b><u>N</u>    Print only the first <u>N</u> lines of the first page of each article before prompting to continue.  This
              is useful on slow terminals and modem lines to be able to  see  the  first  few  lines  of  longer
              articles.

       -<b>s</b><u>WORD</u> Collect  only  articles which contain the string <u>WORD</u> in their subject (case is ignored).  This is
              normally combined with the -x and -m options to find all articles on a specific subject.

       -<b>s/</b><u>regexp</u>
              Collect only articles whose subject matches the  regular  expression  <u>regexp</u>.   This  is  normally
              combined with the -x and -m options to find all articles on a specific subject.

       -<b>n</b><u>WORD</u> or -<b>n/</b><u>regexp</u>
              Same  as -<b>s</b> except that it matches on the sender's name instead of the article's subject.  This is
              normally combined with the -x and -m options to find all articles  from  a  specific  author.   It
              cannot be mixed with the -<b>s</b> option!

       -<b>i</b>     Normally  searches  with  -<b>n</b>  and  -<b>s</b>  are  case independent.  Using this option, the case becomes
              significant.

       -<b>m</b>     Merge all articles into one `meta group' instead of showing them one group at  a  time.   This  is
              normally  used  together  with the -x and -s options to get all the articles on a specific subject
              presented on a single menu (when you don't care about which group they belong  to).   When  -m  is
              used, no articles will be marked as read.

       -<b>x</b>[<u>N</u>]  Present  (or scan) all (or the last <u>N</u>) unread as well as read articles.  When this option is used,
              <u>nn</u> will <u>never</u> mark unread articles as read (i.e. .newsrc is not updated).

       -<b>X</b>     Read/scan unsubscribed groups also.  Most useful when  looking  for  a  specific  subject  in  <b>all</b>
              groups, e.g.
                   nn -mxX -sSubject all

       <u>news.group</u>  or  <u>file</u>  or  <u>+folder</u>
              If  none  of  these arguments are given, all subscribed news groups will be used.  Otherwise, only
              the specified news groups and/or files will be collected and  presented.   In  specifying  a  news
              groups, the following `meta notation' can be used:
              If  the news group ends with a `.' (or `.all'), all subgroups of the news group will be collected,
              e.g.
                   comp.sources.
              If a news group starts with a `.' (or `all.'), all the matching subgroups will be collected, e.g.
                   .sources.unix
              The argument `all' identifies all (subscribed) news groups.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>INPUT</b></h4><pre>
       In general, <u>nn</u> commands consist of one or two key-strokes, and <u>nn</u> reacts instantly to  the  commands  you
       give it; you don't have to enter <b>return</b> after each command (except where explicitly stated).

       Some  commands  have  more  serious  effects  than  others,  and therefore <u>nn</u> requests you to confirm the
       command.  You confirm by hitting the the <b>y</b> key, and reject by hitting the <b>n</b> key.  Some `trivial' requests
       may also be confirmed simply by hitting <b>space.</b>  For example, to confirm the creation of a save file, just
       hit <b>space,</b> but if one or more directories also have to be created, you must enter <b>y.</b>

       Many commands will require that you enter a line of text, e.g. a file name or a shell  command.   If  you
       enter  <b>space</b>  as  the  first character on a line, the line will be filled with a default value (if one is
       defined).  For example, the default value for a file name is the last file name you have entered, and the
       default shell command is your previous shell command.  You can edit this  default  value  as  well  as  a
       directly  typed  text, using the following editing commands.  The <b>erase</b>, <b>kill</b>, and <b>interrupt</b> keys are the
       keys defined by the current tty settings.  On systems without  job  control,  the  <b>suspend</b>  key  will  be
       <b>control-Z</b> while it is the current suspend character on system with job control.

       <b>erase</b>
              Delete the last character on the line.

       <b>delete-word</b>   (normally ^W)
              Delete the last word or component of the input.

       <b>kill</b>
              Delete all characters on the line.

       <b>interrupt</b>  and  <b>control-G</b>
              Cancel the command which needs the input.

       <b>suspend</b>
              Suspend <u>nn</u> if supported by the system.  Otherwise, spawn an interactive shell.

       <b>return</b>
              Terminate the line, and continue with the command.

       <b>Related</b> <b>variables</b>: erase-key, flow-control, flush-typeahead, help-key, kill-key, word-key.

</pre><h4><b>BASIC</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  numerous  commands  in  <u>nn</u>,  and  most  of  them  can  be invoked by a single keystroke.  The
       descriptions in this manual are based on the standard bindings of the commands to the  keys,  but  it  is
       possible  to  customize  these using the <b>map</b> command described later.  For each of the keystroke commands
       described in this manual, the corresponding command name  will  also  be  shown  in  curly  braces,  e.g.
       {<b>command</b>}.

       The  following  commands work in both selection mode and in reading mode.  The notation ^X means `control
       X':

       <b>?</b>    {<b>help</b>}
              Help.  Gives a one page overview of the commands available in the current mode.

       <b>^L</b>   {<b>redraw</b>}
              Redraw screen.

       <b>^R</b>   {<b>redraw</b>}
              Redraw screen (Same as ^L).

       <b>^P</b>   {<b>message</b>}
              Repeat the last message shown on the message line.  The command can be  repeated  to  successively
              show previous messages (the maximum number of saved messages is controlled via the <b>message-history</b>
              variable.)

       <b>!</b>    {<b>shell</b>}
              Shell  escape.   The  user is prompted for a command which is executed by your favorite shell (see
              the <b>shell</b> variable).  Shell escapes are described in detail later on.

       <b>Q</b>    {<b>quit</b>}
              Quit <u>nn</u>.  When you use this command, you neither lose unread articles in the current group nor the
              selections you might have made (unless the articles are expired in the meantime of course).

       <b>V</b>    {<b>version</b>}
              Print release and version information.

       <b>:</b><u>command</u>  {<b>command</b>}
              Execute the <u>command</u> by name.  This form can be used to invoke any of  <u>nn</u>'s  commands,  also  those
              which  cannot  be  bound  to  a  key (such as <b>:coredump</b>), or those which are not bound to a key by
              default (such as <b>post</b> and <b>unshar</b>).

       <b>Related</b> <b>and</b> <b>basic</b> <b>variables</b>: backup, backup-suffix,  confirm-auto-quit,  expert,  mail,  message-history,
       new-group-action, newsrc, quick-count.

</pre><h4><b>SELECTION</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       In  selection  mode,  the screen is divided into four parts: the header line showing the name of the news
       group and the number of articles, the menu lines which show the collected  articles  -  one  article  per
       line,  the prompt line where you enter commands, and the message line where <u>nn</u> prints various messages to
       you.

       Each menu line begins with an <u>article</u> <u>id</u> which is a unique letter (or digit if your screen can show  more
       than  26  menu lines).  To select an articles for reading, you simply enter the corresponding <u>id</u>, and the
       menu line will be high-lighted to indicate that the article is selected.  When you have selected all  the
       interesting articles on the present menu, you simply hit <b>space</b>.

       If  there  are  more articles collected for the current group than could be presented on one screenful of
       text, you will be presented with the next portion of articles to select from.   When  you  have  had  the
       opportunity to select among all the articles in the group, hitting <b>space</b> will enter reading mode.

       If  no  articles  have been selected in the current group, hitting <b>space</b> will enter selection mode on the
       next news group, or exit <u>nn</u> if the current group was the last news group with unread articles. It is thus
       possible to go through ALL unread articles (without reading any of them) just  by  hitting  <b>space</b>  a  few
       times.

       The articles will be presented on the menu using one of the following layouts:

       0:     <u>x</u> <u>Name.........</u>  <u>Subject..............</u> <u>+123</u>

       1:     <u>x</u> <u>Name.........</u>   <u>123</u>  <u>Subject..............</u>

       2:     <u>x</u> <u>123</u>  <u>Subject...................................</u>

       3:     <u>x</u> <u>Subject...........................................</u>

       4:     <u>x</u>    <u>Subject........................................</u>

       Here  <u>x</u>  is  the letter or digit that must be entered to select the article, <u>Name</u> is the real name of the
       sender (or the mail address if the real name cannot be found), <u>Subject</u> is the contents of the  "Subject:"
       line in the article, and <u>123</u> is the number of lines in the article.

       Layout  0  and 1 are just two ways to present the same information, while layout 2 and 3 are intended for
       groups whose articles have very long subject lines, e.g. comp.sources.

       Layout 4 is a hybrid between layout 1 and 3.  It will normally use layout 1, but it  will  use  layout  3
       (with  a  little  indentation)  for  menu lines where the subject is longer than the space available with
       layout 1.

       Layout 1 is the default layout, and an alternative menu line layout is selected using the -<b>L</b> option or by
       setting the <b>layout</b> variable.  Once <u>nn</u> is started the layout can be changed at any time using  the  <b>"</b>  key
       {<b>layout</b>}.

       The  <u>Name</u> is limited to 16 characters, and to make maximum use of this space, <u>nn</u> will perform a series of
       simplifications on the name, e.g. changing first names into initials, removing  domain  names  from  mail
       addresses  (if the real name is not found) etc.  It does a good job, but some people on the net put weird
       things into the From: field (or actually into their password file) which result  in  <u>nn</u>  producing  quite
       cryptic, and sometimes funny "names".

       One  a  usual  80  column terminal, the <u>Subject</u> is limited to about 60 characters (75 in layout 3) and is
       thus only an approximation to the actual subject line which may be much longer.  To get as  much  out  of
       this  space,  <u>Re:</u>  prefixes (in various forms) are recognized and replaced by a single `&gt;' character (see
       the <b>re-layout</b> variable).

       Since articles are sorted according to the subject, two or more adjacent  articles  may  share  the  same
       subject  (ignoring any `&gt;'s).  In this case, only the first article will show the subject of the article;
       the rest will only show the `&gt;' character in the subject field (or a `-'  if  there  is  no  `&gt;'  at  the
       beginning  of  the  line).  A typical menu will thus only show each subject once, saving a lot of time in
       scanning the news articles.

       If <u>consolidated</u> <u>menus</u> (see section below) are enabled, adjacent articles sharing the same subject will be
       shown with a <u>single</u> line on the menu corresponding to the <u>first</u> of the articles.  The number of  articles
       with the same subject will be shown as a braketed number in front of the subject, e.g. with layout 1:
            <u>x</u> <u>Name.........</u>   <u>123</u>  <u>[4]</u> <u>Subject..............</u>
       For further information see the section on consolidated menus below.

</pre><h4><b>ARTICLE</b> <b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       While <u>nn</u> is running and between invocations, <u>nn</u> associates an <u>attribute</u> with each article on your system.
       These  attributes are used to differentiate between read and unread articles, selected articles, articles
       marked for later treatment, etc.  Depending on how <u>nn</u>  is  configured,  these  attributes  can  be  saved
       between invocations of <u>nn</u>, or some of them may only be used while <u>nn</u> is running.

       The  attribute  is shown on the menu using either a single character following the <u>article</u> <u>id</u> or by high-
       lighting the menu line, depending on the attribute and the capabilities of the terminal.   You  can  also
       change the attributes to your own taste (see the <b>attributes</b> variable).

       The  attribute of an article can be changed explicitly using the selection mode commands described below,
       or it will change automatically for example when you have read or saved a selected article.  If a command
       may change any article attributes, it will be noted in the description of  the  command.   The  following
       descriptions  of  the attributes will only mention the most important commands that may set (or preserve)
       the attribute.

       The following attributes may be associated with an article:

       <b>read</b>   Menu attribute "." - indicates that the article has been read or saved.  When you leave the group,
              these articles will be marked permanently read, and are not presented the next time you enter  the
              group.

       <b>seen</b>   Menu  attribute  ","  -  indicates that the article is unread, but that it has been <u>presented</u> on a
              menu.  Depending on how <u>nn</u> is configured, these articles will automatically be  marked  <u>read</u>  when
              you  leave the group, they may remain <u>seen</u>, or they may just be <u>unread</u> the next time you enter the
              group (see the <b>auto-junk-seen</b>, <b>confirm-junk-seen</b>, and <b>retain-seen-status</b> variables).
              Only the commands <b>continue</b> (<b>space</b>) and <b>read-skip</b> (<b>X</b>) will mark <u>unread</u> articles on the current  (or
              all)  menu pages as <u>seen</u> when they are used.  Other commands that scroll through the menu pages or
              enter reading mode will let unread articles remain unread.

       <b>unread</b> Menu attribute " " - indicates an unread article.  These articles were unread when you entered the
              group, and they may remain unread when you leave the group, unless they have been marked  <u>seen</u>  by
              the command that you used to leave the group or enter reading mode.

       <b>selected</b>
              Menu line high-lighted (or menu attribute "*") - indicates that you have selected the article.  If
              you leave the group, the selected articles will remain selected the next time you enter the group.
              When you have read a selected article, the attribute will automatically change to <u>read</u>.

       <b>auto-selected</b>
              These  articles have the same appearance as <u>selected</u> articles on the menu, and the only difference
              is that these articles have been selected automatically via  the  auto-selection  facility  rather
              than manually by you.  Very few commands differentiate between these attributes and if they do, it
              is  explicitly  stated in this manual.  The main difference is that these articles are only marked
              as <u>unread</u> when you leave the group (supposing they will also be auto-selected the next  the  group
              is entered).  This simplifies the house-keeping between invocations of <u>nn</u>.

       <b>leave</b>  Menu attribute "+" - indicates that the article is marked for later treatment by the <b>leave-article</b>
              (<b>l</b>)  command.  These articles may be selected (on demand) when you have read all selected articles
              in a group.  However, if you do not select them then immediately, they are stored  as  the  <b>leave-</b>
              <b>next</b> attribute described below.

       <b>leave-next</b>
              Menu  attribute  "="  - indicates that the article is marked for later treatment by the <b>leave-next</b>
              (<b>L</b>) command.  This is a permanent attribute, which will remain on the  article  until  you  either
              read  the  article,  change  the  attribute,  or it is expired.  So assigning this attribute to an
              article will effectively keep it unread until <u>you</u> do something.  If the variable <b>select-leave-next</b>
              is set, <u>nn</u> will ask whether these articles should be <b>selected</b> on entry to a group (but  naturally,
              doing so will change the <b>leave-next</b> attribute to <b>select</b>).

       <b>cancelled</b>
              Menu  attribute  "#"  - indicates that the article has been cancelled.  This is mainly useful when
              tidying a folder; it is set by the <b>cancel</b> (<b>C</b>) command, and can be  cleared  by  any  command  that
              change attributes, e.g. you can select and deselect the article.

       <b>killed</b> Menu  attribute  "!"  -  indicates  that the article has been killed (e.g.  by the <b>K</b> {<b>kill-select</b>}
              command).  Killed articles are immediately removed from the menu, so you should not  normally  see
              articles with this attribute.  If you do, report it as a bug!

       The  attributes are saved in two files: .newsrc (<u>read</u> articles) and .nn/select (other attributes).  Plain
       <u>unread</u> articles are saved by not occurring in either of these files.  Both files are  described  in  more
       detail later on.

       <b>Related</b> <b>variables</b>: attributes, auto-junk-seen, confirm-junk-seen, retain-seen-status, select-leave-next.

</pre><h4><b>SELECTION</b> <b>MODE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The  primary  purpose  of the selection mode is of course to select the articles to be read, but numerous
       other commands may also be performed in this mode: saving of articles in files, replying and following up
       on articles, mailing/forwarding articles, shell escapes etc.

       As described above, the <u>selected</u> articles are marked either by showing the  corresponding  menu  line  in
       standout  mode  (reverse  video), or if the terminal does not have this capability by placing an asterisk
       (*) after the selection letter or digit.

       Most commands which are used to select articles will work as toggle commands.   If  the  article  is  not
       already  selected,  the  <u>selected</u>attribute  on  the  article(s),  independent  on the previous attribute.
       Otherwise, the article(s) will be <u>deselected</u> and marked <u>unread</u>.  Consequently, any article can be  marked
       <u>unread</u> simply be selecting and deselecting it.

       During  selection,  the  cursor  will  normally be placed on the article following the last article whose
       attribute was changed (initially the first article).  The article pointed out by the cursor is called the
       <u>current</u> <u>article</u>, and the following commands work relative to the current article and cursor position.

       <b>abc...z</b> <b>01..9</b>  {<u>article</u> <u>N</u>}
              The article with the given  identification  letter  or  digit  is  selected  or  deselected.   The
              following  article  becomes  the current article.  If the variable <b>auto-select-subject</b> is set, all
              articles with the same subject as the given article are selected.

       <b>.</b>    {<b>select</b>}
              Select or deselect the current article and move the cursor to the next article.

       <b>,</b>    {<b>line+1</b>}
              Move the cursor to the next article.  You can use the <u>down</u> <u>arrow</u> as well.

       <b>/</b>    {<b>line-1</b>}
              Move cursor to previous article.  You can use the <u>up</u> <u>arrow</u> as well.

       <b>*</b>    {<b>select-subject</b>}
              Select or deselect all articles with same subject as  current  article.   This  will  work  across
              several menu pages if necessary.

       <b>-</b><u>x</u>   {<b>select-range</b>}
              Select  or deselect the range of articles between the current article and the article specified by
              <u>x</u>.  For example you can select all articles from <u>e</u> to <u>k</u> by simply typing <b>e-k</b>.

       The following commands may change the attributes on all articles on the current  menu  page,  or  on  all
       articles on all menu pages.

       <b>@</b>    {<b>select-invert</b>}
              Reverse  selections.   All  selected  articles on the current page are deselected, and vice-versa.
              (Use the <b>find</b> command to select all articles.)

       <b>~</b>    {<b>unselect-all</b>}
              Deselect all <u>auto-selected</u> articles in the group (this works  across  all  menu  pages).   If  the
              command is executed twice, the <u>selected</u> articles will also be deselected.

       <b>+</b>    {<b>select-auto</b>}
              Perform auto-selections in the group (see the section on "auto kill/select" below).

       <b>=</b>    {<b>find</b>}
              Prompts  for  a regular expression, and selects all articles on the menu (all pages) which matches
              the regular expression.  Depending on the variable <b>select-on-sender</b> matching is performed  against
              the  subject  (default)  or the sender of the articles.  An empty answer (<b>=</b> <b>return</b>) will reuse the
              previous expression.  Example:  The command <b>=</b> <b>.</b> <b>return</b> will select <u>all</u> articles in the group.

       <b>J</b>    {<b>junk-articles</b>}
              This is a very versatile command which can be used to perform  all  sorts  of  attribute  changes,
              either on individual articles, all articles on the current menu page, all articles with a specific
              attribute,  or all available articles.  To access all the functions of this command, the <b>J</b> key may
              have to be hit up to four times, to loop through different one-line menus.  The full functionality
              of the <b>junk-articles</b> command is described in a separate section below.

       <b>L</b>    {<b>leave-next</b>}
              This is a specialized version of the generic <b>J</b>  {<b>junk-articles</b>}  command  to  set  the  <u>leave-next</u>
              attribute on a subset of the articles on the menu.  It is also described further below.

       The  following  commands  move  between  the  pages  belonging to the same news group when there are more
       articles than will fit on a single page.  These commands will not change any article attributes.

       <b>&gt;</b>    {<b>page+1</b>}
              Goto next menu page.

       <b>&lt;</b>    {<b>page-1</b>}
              Goto previous menu page, or to last menu page if on first menu page.

       <b>$</b>    {<b>page=$</b>}
              Goto last menu page.

       <b>^</b>    {<b>page=1</b>}
              Goto first menu page.

       The following commands are used to enter reading mode for the selected articles, and to move between news
       groups (in selection mode).  They may change article attributes if noted below.

       <b>space</b>     {<b>continue</b>}
              Continue to next menu page, or if on last menu page, read the selected articles.  If  no  articles
              have been selected, continue to the next news group.  The <u>unread</u> articles on the current menu page
              will automatically be marked <u>seen</u>.

       <b>return</b>    {<b>continue-no-mark</b>}
              Identical  to  the <b>continue</b> command, except that the <u>unread</u> articles on the current menu page will
              remain <u>unread</u>.  (The <b>newline</b> key has the same effect).

       <b>Z</b>    {<b>read-return</b>}
              Enter reading mode <u>immediately</u> with the currently selected articles.  When all articles have  been
              read,  return to selection mode in the <u>current</u> group.  It will mark <u>selected</u> articles <u>read</u> as they
              are read, but <u>unread</u> articles are not normally  changed  (can  be  controlled  with  the  variable
              <b>marked-by-read-return</b>.)

       <b>X</b>    {<b>read-skip</b>}
              Mark all <u>unmarked</u> articles <u>seen</u> on all menu pages (or the pages defined by the <b>marked-by-read-skip</b>
              variable),  and  enter  reading  mode  <u>immediately</u>  with  the currently selected articles.  As the
              selected articles are read, they are marked <u>read</u>.  When all selected articles have been  read,  <u>nn</u>
              will enter selection mode in the <u>next</u> news group.  <b>When</b> <b>no</b> <b>articles</b> <b>are</b> <b>selected,</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>directly</b>
              <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>group</b>.  This can be used to skip all the articles in a large news group without having
              to go through all the menu pages.

       If you don't want to read the current group now, but want to keep it for later, you can use the following
       commands  which will only mark <u>seen</u> and <u>read</u> articles as read.  Currently selected articles will still be
       selected the next time you enter the group.  None of these commands will change any attributes themselves
       (by default).

       <b>N</b>    {<b>next-group</b>}
              Go forward to the next group in the presentation sequence.  If the  variable  <b>marked-by-next-group</b>
              is set articles on the menu can optionally be marked <u>seen</u>

       <b>P</b>    {<b>previous</b>}
              Go  back  to  the previous group.  This command will enter selection mode on the last active group
              (two P commands in sequence will bring you to the current group).  If there are still some  <u>unread</u>
              articles  in the group, only those articles will be shown.  Otherwise, all the articles which were
              unread when <u>nn</u> was invoked will be shown marked with the <u>read</u> attribute (which can be  changed  as
              usual).

       As described in the "Article Attributes" section, the <u>read</u> and <u>seen</u> articles will normally be marked read
       when you leave the group, and these articles are not shown the next time you enter the group.

       In  all  releases  prior  to release 6.4, it was impossible to have individual articles in a group marked
       <u>unread</u> when you left a group, and the default behaviour of release 6.4 onwards  will  closely  match  the
       traditional  behaviour.   This means that the <u>seen</u> and <u>read</u> articles are treated alike for most practical
       purposes with the default variable settings.

       If you don't like <u>nn</u> to silently mark the <u>seen</u> articles read, you can <u>set</u> the variable  <b>confirm-junk-seen</b>
       to  get <u>nn</u> to prompt you for confirmation before doing this, or you can <u>unset</u> the variable <b>auto-junk-seen</b>
       to simply keep the seen articles for the next time you enter the group.  You  then  have  to  use  the  <b>J</b>
       {<b>junk-articles</b>} to mark articles read.

       Using <b>return</b> {<b>continue-no-mark</b>} will also allow you to keep articles <u>unread</u> rather than marking them <u>seen</u>
       when  scrolling  through  the  menu  pages  and entering reading mode.  If this is your preferred reading
       style, you can remap <b>space</b> to this command.

       <b>Related</b> <b>variables</b>: auto-junk-seen,  auto-preview-mode,  auto-select-subject,  case-fold-search,  confirm-
       auto-quit, confirm-entry, confirm-junk-seen, marked-by-next-group, marked-by-read-return, marked-by-read-
       skip, retain-seen-status, select-on-sender.

</pre><h4><b>CONSOLIDATED</b> <b>MENUS</b></h4><pre>
       Normally,  <u>nn</u>  will  use  one  menu  line  for each article, so if there are many articles with identical
       subjects, each menu page will only contain a few different subjects.  To have  each  subject  occur  only
       once on the menu, <u>nn</u> can operate with consolidated menus by setting the variable <b>consolidated-menu</b>.

       When consolidated menus are used, <u>nn</u> operates with two kinds of subjects: open and closed.

       An  <u>open</u>  <u>subject</u>  is a subject which is shown in the traditional way with one menu line for each article
       with the given subject.  In other words, when consolidated menus are not used, all subjects are open  (by
       default).

       A  <u>closed</u> <u>subject</u> is a multi-article subject which is presented by a single menu line.  This line will be
       the normal menu line for the first (oldest)  article  with  the  subject,  but  with  the  subject  field
       annotated with a bracketed number showing the number of articles with that subject, e.g.
            a Kim F. Storm     12  [4] Future plans for nn
            b.Kim F. Storm     43  [3] More plans for nn
       In  this  example, there are four unread articles with subject `a' of which the first is posted by me and
       has 12 lines.  The rest of the articles are hidden, and will only be shown on request.  The  `.'   marker
       on subject `b' shows that all three articles within that subject have been read (or seen).

       To  select (or deselect) ALL the articles within a closed subject, simply select the article shown on the
       menu; this will automatically select (or deselect) the  rest  (see  auto-select-closed).   When  all  the
       unread articles within a closed subject are selected, the menu line will be high-lighted.

       If  you  want to view the individual articles in a subject (maybe to select individual articles), you can
       open the subject with the commands:

       <b>(x</b>     Open subject <u>x</u> on menu.

       <b>((</b>     Open current subject.

       When you have completed viewing the opened subject, you can close it again using the commands:

       <b>)x</b>     Close subject <u>x</u> on menu (<u>x</u> is any article with the subject).

       <b>))</b>     Close current subject.

       In the basic layout of the menu line for a closed subject as shown above,  ALL  articles  in  the  closed
       subject are supposed to be either:

       <u>unread</u> The menu line is <u>not</u> high-lighted.

       <u>selected</u>
              Menu line is fully high-lighted (if all UNREAD are selected).

       <b>read/seen</b>
              There is a `.' (read attribute) following the article id.

       If neither of these cases apply, i.e. there is a mixture of unread, selected, and seen/read articles, the
       bracketed number will have one of the following formats:

       [U:T]  There are U unread articles of T total (U&lt;T).

       [S/T]  There are S selected articles of T total (S&lt;U=T).

       [S/U:T]
              There are S selected of U unread of T total (S&lt;U&lt;T).

       If  there  are any selected articles (S&gt;0), the information between the brackets will be high-lighted (to
       show that something is selected, but not all the unread articles).

       <b>Notice</b>:  Consolidated menus only work with the `subject' and `lexical' sorting methods.

       Variables related to consolidated menus are: auto-select-closed,  consolidated-menu,  counter-delim-left,
       counter-delim-right, counter-padding, save-closed-mode.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>JUNK-ARTICLES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LEAVE-NEXT</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>J</b>  {<b>junk-articles</b>}  command  is  a  very  flexible  command which can perform all sorts of attribute
       changes, either on individual articles, all articles on the  current  menu  page,  all  articles  with  a
       specific attribute, or all available articles.

       To  access  all  the  functions  of  this command, the <b>J</b> key may have to be hit up to four times, to loop
       through different one-line menus:

       <b>Mark</b> <b>Read</b>
              This submenu allows you to mark articles <u>read</u>.

       <b>Unmark</b> This submenu allows you to mark articles <u>unread</u>.

       <b>Select</b> This submenu allows you to select articles based on their attribute.

       <b>Kill</b>   This submenu allows you to mark articles <u>read</u> and  remove  them  from  the  menu  based  on  their
              attribute.

       The <b>L</b> {<b>leave-next</b>} command is an extension of the <b>J</b> command with a fifth menu:

       <b>Leave</b>  This  menu allows you to mark articles for later handling with the <u>leave-next</u> attribute which will
              keep the article unread until you explicitly change the attribute (e.g. by reading it)  or  it  is
              expired.

       For each of these submenus, <u>nn</u> will list the most plausible choices you may use, but all of the following
       answers  can  be used at all submenus.  When you have entered a choice, <u>nn</u> will afterward ask whether the
       change should be made to all menu pages or only the current page.

       <b>J</b>      Show next submenu.

       <b>L</b>      Change attribute on all <u>leave</u> articles.

       <b>N</b>      Change attribute on all <u>leave-next</u> articles.

       <b>R</b>      Change attribute on all <u>read</u> articles.

       <b>S</b>      Change attribute on all <u>seen</u> articles.

       <b>U</b>      Change attribute on all unmarked (i.e. <u>unread</u>) articles.

       <b>A</b>      Change attribute on <u>all</u> articles no matter their current attribute.

       <b>*</b>      Change attribute on all <u>selected</u> articles on <u>the</u> <u>current</u> page.

       <b>+</b>      Change attribute on all <u>selected</u> articles on <u>all</u> pages.

       <b>a-z0-9</b> Change attribute on one or more specific articles on the  current  page.   You  end  the  list  of
              articles by a <b>space</b> or by using one of the other choices described above.

       <b>.</b>      Change attribute on <u>current</u> article.

       <b>,</b> <b>/</b>    Move the current article down or up the menu without changing any attributes.

</pre><h4><b>READING</b> <b>MODE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       In  reading  mode,  the  <u>selected</u>  articles are presented one page at a time.  To get the next page of an
       article, simply hit <b>space</b>, and when you are on the last page of an article, hit <b>space</b> to get to the  next
       selected article.  Articles are normally marked read when you go to the next article, while going back to
       the menu, quitting <u>nn</u>, etc. will retain the attribute on the current article.

       When  you  are  on the last page of the last article, hit <b>space</b> to enter selection mode on the next group
       (or the current group if reading mode was entered using the <b>Z</b> command).

       To read an article, the following text scrolling commands are available:

       <b>space</b>     {<b>continue</b>}
              Scroll <u>one</u> <u>page</u> <u>forward</u> or continue with the next article or group as described above.

       <b>backspace</b> <b>/</b> <b>delete</b>  {<b>page-1</b>}
              Go <u>one</u> <u>page</u> <u>backwards</u> in article.

       <b>d</b>    {<b>page+1/2</b>}
              Scroll one <u>half</u> <u>page</u> <u>forward</u>.

       <b>u</b>    {<b>page-1/2</b>}
              Go one <u>half</u> <u>page</u> <u>backwards</u>.

       <b>return</b>    {<b>line+1</b>}
              Scroll <u>one</u> <u>line</u> <u>forward</u> in the article.

       <b>tab</b>  {<b>skip-lines</b>}
              Skip over lines starting with the same character as the last line on the current  page.   This  is
              useful to skip over included text or to the next file in a shell archive.

       <b>^</b>    {<b>page=1</b>}
              Move to the <u>first</u> <u>page</u> (excluding the header) of the article.

       <b>$</b>    {<b>page=$</b>}
              Move to the <u>last</u> <u>page</u> of the article.

       <b>g</b><u>N</u>   {<b>line=@</b>}
              Move to line <u>N</u> in the article.

       <b>/</b><u>regexp</u>   {<b>find</b>}
              Search forward for text matching the regular expression <u>regexp</u> in the article.  If a matching text
              is found, it will be high-lighted.

       <b>.</b>    {<b>find-next</b>}
              Repeat search for last regular expression.

       <b>h</b>    {<b>page=0</b>}
              Show the <u>header</u> of the article, and continue from the top of the article.

       <b>H</b>    {<b>full-digest</b>}
              If  the  current  article is extracted from a digest, show the entire digest article including its
              header.  Another <b>H</b> command will return to the current subarticle.

       <b>D</b>    {<b>rot13</b>}
              Turn <u>rot13</u> (caesar) decryption on and off for the current article, and redraw  current  page.   If
              the  article  is  saved while it is decrypted on the screen, it will be saved in decrypted form as
              well!

       <b>c</b>    {<b>compress</b>}
              Turn compression on and off for the current article and redraw  current  page.   With  compression
              turned  on,  multiple  spaces  and tabs are shown as a single space.  This makes it much easier to
              read right justified text which separate words  with  several  spaces.   (See  also  the  <b>compress</b>
              variable)

       The following commands are used to move among the selected articles.

       <b>n</b>    {<b>next-article</b>}
              Move to next selected article.  This command skips the rest of the current article, marks it <u>read</u>,
              and  jumps directly to the first page of the next selected article (or to the next group if it was
              the last selected article).

       <b>l</b>    {<b>leave-article</b>}
              Mark the current article with the <u>leave</u> attribute and continue with  the  next  selected  article.
              When  all  the selected articles in the current group have been read, these <u>left</u> <u>over</u> articles can
              be automatically selected and shown once more, or the treatment can be postponed to the next  time
              you enter the group.
                This  is  particularly  useful if you see an article which you may want to respond to unless one
              the following articles is already saying what you intended to say.

       <b>L</b>    {<b>leave-next</b>}
              Mark the current article with the  <u>leave-next</u>  attribute  and  continue  with  the  next  selected
              article.

       <b>p</b>    {<b>previous</b>}
              Goto previous article.

       <b>k</b>    {<b>next-subject</b>}
              Kill  subject.   Skips  rest of current article, and all following articles with the same subject.
              The skipped articles are marked <u>read</u>.  To kill a subject permanently use the <b>K</b> command.

       <b>*</b>    {<b>select-subject</b>}
              Show next article with <u>same</u> subject (even if it is not selected).  This command  will  <u>select</u>  all
              following  articles  with  the  same subject as the current article (similar to the `*' command in
              selection mode).  This can be used to select only the first article  on  a  subject  in  selection
              mode, and then select all follow-ups in reading mode if you find the article interesting.

       <b>a</b>    {<b>advance-article</b>}
              Goto the following article on the menu even if it is not selected.  This command skips the rest of
              the  current article and jumps directly to the first page of the next article (it will not skip to
              the next group if it is the last article).  The attribute on the current article will be restored,
              except for the <u>unread</u> attribute which will be changed to <u>seen</u>.

       <b>b</b>    {<b>back-article</b>}
              Goto the article before current article on the menu even if it is not selected.  This  is  similar
              to the <b>a</b> command, except for the direction.

       The  following  commands  perform  an immediate return from reading mode to selection mode in the <u>current</u>
       group or skip to the next group.

       <b>=</b>    {<b>goto-menu</b>}
              Return to selection mode in the current group (think of = as the "icon" of  the  selection  menu).
              The articles read so far will be marked <u>read</u>.

       <b>N</b>    {<b>next-group</b>}
              Skip the rest of the <u>selected</u> and <u>unread</u> articles in the current group and go directly to the next
              group.  Only the <u>read</u> (and <u>seen</u>) articles in the current group are marked as read.

       <b>X</b>    {<b>read-skip</b>}
              Mark  <u>all</u>  articles  in the current group as read and go directly to the next group.  (You will be
              asked to confirm this command.)

       <b>Related</b> <b>variables</b>: case-fold-search, charset,  compress,  data-bits,  date,  header-lines,  mark-overlap,
       monitor, overlap, scroll-clear-page, stop, trusted-escape-codes, wrap-header-margin.

</pre><h4><b>PREVIEWING</b> <b>ARTICLES</b> <b>IN</b> <b>SELECTION</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       In  selection  mode,  it is possible to read a specific article on the menu without entering reading mode
       for all the selected articles on the menu.  Using the commands described below will  enter  reading  mode
       for one article only, and then return to the menu mode immediately after (depending on the setting of the
       <b>preview-continuation</b> variable).

       If  there are more than 5 free lines at the bottom of the menu screen, <u>nn</u> will use that space to show the
       article (a minimal preview window can be permanently allocated with the <b>window</b> variable).  Otherwise, the
       screen will be cleared to show the article.

       After previewing an article, it will be marked read (if the <b>preview-mark-read</b> variable is set),  and  the
       following article will become the current article.

       <b>%</b><u>x</u>   {<b>preview</b>}
              Preview article <u>x</u>.

       <b>%%</b>   {<b>preview</b>}
              Preview the current article.

       When the article is being shown, the following reading mode commands are very useful:

       <b>=</b>    {<b>goto-menu</b>}
              Skip the rest of the current article, and return to menu mode.

       <b>n</b>    {<b>next-article</b>}
              Skip the rest of the current article, and <u>preview</u> <u>the</u> <u>next</u> <u>article</u>.

       <b>l</b>    {<b>leave-article</b>}
              Mark  the  article  as  <u>selected</u> (!) on the menu for handling later on.  Then skip the rest of the
              current article, and preview the next article.

       <b>%</b><u>y</u>   {<b>preview</b>}
              Preview article <u>y</u> <u>.</u>

       If the variable <b>auto-preview-mode</b> is set, just hitting the article id in menu  mode  will  enter  preview
       mode on the specified article.

       <b>Related</b> <b>variables</b>: auto-preview-mode, min-window, preview-continuation, preview-mark-read, window.

</pre><h4><b>SAVING</b> <b>ARTICLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following commands are used to save articles in files, unpack archives, decode binaries, etc.  It is
       possible to use the commands in both reading mode to save the current article and in  selection  mode  to
       save one or more articles on the menu.

       The  saved articles will be <u>appended</u> to the specified file(s) followed by an empty line each.  Both files
       and directories will be created as needed.  When an article has been saved in a file, a message reporting
       the number of lines saved will be shown if the <b>save-report</b> variable is set (default on).

       <b>S</b>    {<b>save-full</b>}
              Save articles including the full article header.

       <b>O</b>    {<b>save-short</b>}
              Save articles with a short header containing only the name of the sender,  the  subject,  and  the
              posting date of the article.

       <b>E</b>    {<b>save-header</b>}
              Save only the header of the articles.

       <b>W</b>    {<b>save-body</b>}
              Write article <u>without</u> a header.

       <b>:print</b>    {<b>print</b>}
              Print  article.   Instead  of a file name, this command will prompt for the print command to which
              the current article will be piped.  The default print command is specified at compile time, but it
              can be changed by setting the <b>printer</b> variable.  The output will be identical to  that  of  the  <b>O</b>
              command.

       <b>:patch</b>    {<b>patch</b>}
              Send articles through <b><a href="../man1/patch.1.html">patch</a></b>(1) (or the program defined in the <b>patch-command</b> variable).  Instead of
              a  file name, you will be prompted for the name of a directory in which you want the patch command
              to be executed.  <u>nn</u> will then pipe the body of the article through the patch command.
                The output from the patch process will be shown on the screen and also appended to a file  named
              <u>Patch.Result</u> in the patch directory.

       <b>:unshar</b>   {<b>unshar</b>}
              Unshar  articles.  You will be prompted for the name of a directory in which you want <u>nn</u> to unshar
              the articles.  <u>nn</u> will then pipe the proper parts of the article body into a  Bourne  Shell  whose
              working directory will be set to the specified directory.
                During  the  unpacking, the normal output from the unshar process will appear on the screen, and
              the menu or article text will be redrawn when the process is finished.
                The output is also appended to a file named <u>Unshar.Result</u> in the unshar directory.
                The file specified in <b>unshar-header-file</b> (default "Unshar.Headers") in the unshar directory will
              contain the header and initial text (before the shar data) from the article.  You can use the  `G'
              {<b>goto-group</b>} command to look at the Unshar.Headers file.

       <b>:decode</b>   {<b>decode</b>}
              Decode  <u>uuencoded</u> articles into binary files.  You will be prompted for the name of a directory in
              which you want <u>nn</u> to place the decoded binary files (the file names are taken from  the  uuencoded
              data).
                <u>nn</u>  will combine several articles into single files as needed, and you can even decode unrelated
              packages (into the same directory) with one <b>decode</b> command.
                To be able to decode a binary file which spans several articles, <u>nn</u> may  have  to  <u>ignore</u>  lines
              which  fail  the  normal  sanity checks on uuencoded data instead of treating them as <u>transmission</u>
              <u>errors</u>.  Consequently, it is strongly recommended to check the resulting decoded  file  using  the
              checksum which is normally contained in the original article.  (Actually, you are also supposed to
              do this after decoding with a stand-alone uudecode program).
                The  header  and  initial information in the decoded articles are saved in the file specified in
              <b>decode-header-file</b> (default "Decode.Headers") in the same directory as the decoded files.
                If <b>decode-skip-prefix</b> is non-null, <b>:decode</b> will attempt to ignore up to that many characters  on
              each  line  to  find  the encoded data.  This is particularly useful in some binaries groups where
              files are both uuencoded and packed with shar; <u>nn</u> will ignore the prefix added  to  each  line  by
              shar, and thus be able to unshar, concatenate, and decode multi-part postings automatically.

       In reading mode, the following keys can also be used to invoke the save commands:

       <b>s</b>      Same as <b>S</b>.

       <b>o</b>      Same as <b>O</b>.

       <b>w</b>      Same as <b>W</b>.

       <b>P</b>      Same as <b>:print</b>.

       The  save  commands will prompt for a file name which is expanded according to the rules described in the
       section on file name expansion below.  For each group, it is possible to specify a default save  file  in
       the  init  file,  either  in  connection with the group presentation sequence or in a separate <b>save-files</b>
       section (see below).  If a default save file is specified for the group, <u>nn</u> will show this on the  prompt
       line when it prompts for the file name.  You can edit this name as usual, but if you kill the entire name
       immediately,  <u>nn</u>  will replace the default name with the last file name you entered.  If you kill this as
       well, <u>nn</u> will leave you with a blank line.

       If the <b>quick-save</b> variable is set, <u>nn</u> will only prompt for a save file name when the current  article  is
       inside a folder; otherwise, the default save file defined in the init file will be used unconditionally.

       If  the  file  (and  directories  in  the  path)  does  not  exist, <u>nn</u> will ask whether the file (and the
       directories) should be created.

       If the file name contains an asterisk, e.g.
            part*.shar
       <u>nn</u> will save each of the articles in uniquely named  files  constructed  by  replacing  the  asterisk  by
       numbers from the sequence 1, 2, 3, etc.  The format of the string that replaces the * can be changed with
       the <b>save-counter</b> variable, and the first number to use can be changed via <b>save-counter-offset</b>.

       In  <u>selection</u> mode, <u>nn</u> will prompt you for the identifier of one or more articles you want to save.  When
       you don't want to save more articles, just hit <b>space</b>.  The saved articles will be marked <u>read</u>.

       If you enter an asterisk `*' when you are prompted for an article to save, <u>nn</u> will automatically save all
       the <u>selected</u> articles on the <u>current</u> menu page and mark them <u>read</u>.

       Likewise, if you enter a plus `+', <u>nn</u> will save all the selected articles on <u>all</u> menu pages and mark them
       <u>read</u>.

       This is very useful to unpack an entire package using the <b>:unshar</b> and <b>:decode</b> commands.  It can  also  be
       used  in combination with the <u>save</u> <u>selected</u> <u>articles</u> feature to save a selection of articles in separate,
       successively numbered files.  But do not confuse these two concepts!  The <b>S*</b> and <b>S+</b> commands can be  used
       to  save  the  selected  articles in a single file as well as in separate files, and the <u>save</u> <u>in</u> <u>separate</u>
       <u>files</u> feature can be used also when saving individual articles, either in the selection mode, or  in  the
       article reading mode.

       When  articles  are  saved  in  a file with a full or partial header, any header lines in the <u>body</u> of the
       article will be escaped by a tilde (e.g. ~From: ...) to enable <u>nn</u>  to  split  the  folder  into  separate
       articles.  The escape string can be redefined via the <b>embedded-header-escape</b> variable.

       Articles  can  optionally be saved in MAIL or MMDF compatible format by setting the <b>mail-format</b> and <b>mmdf-</b>
       <b>format</b> variables.  These variables only specify the  format  used  when  creating  a  new  folder,  while
       appending  to  an existing folder will be done in the format of the folder (unless <b>folder-format-check</b> is
       false).

       <b>Related</b> <b>variables</b>: confirm-append, confirm-create, decode-header-file, decode-skip-prefix,  default-save-
       file,  folder-save-file,  edit-patch-command,  edit-print-command,  edit-unshar-command,  folder, folder-
       format-check, mail-format, mmdf-format, patch-command, printer, quick-save,  save-counter,  save-counter-
       offset, save-report, suggest-default-save, unshar-command, unshar-header-file.

</pre><h4><b>FOLDER</b> <b>MAINTENANCE</b></h4><pre>
       When  more than one article is saved in a folder, <u>nn</u> is able to split the folder, and each article in the
       folder can be treated like a separate article.

       This means that you can save, decode, reply, follow-up, etc. just as with the original article.

       You can also <u>cancel</u> (delete) individual articles  in  a  folder  using  the  normal  <b>C</b>  {<b>cancel</b>}  command
       described  later.   When  you  quit  from  the  folder,  you  will then be given the option to remove the
       cancelled articles from the folder.

       The original folder is saved in a file named `BackupFolder~' in the .nn directory (see the <b>backup-folder-</b>
       <b>path</b> variable) by renaming or  copying  the  old  folder  as  appropriate.   When  the  folder  has  been
       compressed, the backup folder will be removed unless the variable <b>keep-backup-folder</b> is set.

       If  all  articles  in  a  folder  are  cancelled,  the folder will be removed or truncated to zero length
       (whatever is allowed by directory and file permissions).  In this case no backup folder is retained  even
       when <b>keep-backup-folder</b> is set!

       If  the  variable <b>trace-folder-packing</b> is set, <u>nn</u> will show which articles are kept and which are removed
       as the folder is rewritten.

       Folders are rewritten in the format  of  the  original  folder,  i.e.  the  <b>mail-format</b>  and  <b>mmdf-format</b>
       variables are ignored.

       <b>Related</b> <b>variables</b>: backup-folder-path, keep-backup-folder, trace-folder-packing.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>EXPANSION</b></h4><pre>
       When  the  save commands prompts for a file name, the following file name expansions are performed on the
       file name you enter:

       <b>+</b><u>folder</u>
              The <b>+</b> is replaced by the contents of the <b>folder</b> variable (default value  "<a href="file:~/News/">~/News/</a>")  resulting  in
              the name of a file in the <u>folder</u> <u>directory</u>.  Examples:
                   +emacs, +nn, +sources/shar/nn

       <b>+</b>      A  single  plus  is  replaced by the expansion of the file name contained in the <b>default-save-file</b>
              variable (or by <b>folder-save-file</b> when saving from a folder).

       <b>~/</b><u>file</u> The <b>~</b> is replaced by the contents of the environment variable HOME, i.e. the  path  name  of  your
              home directory.  Examples:
                   <a href="file:~/News/emacs">~/News/emacs</a>, <a href="file:~/News/nn">~/News/nn</a>, <a href="file:~/src/shar/nn">~/src/shar/nn</a>

       <b>~</b><u>user</u><b>/</b><u>file</u>
              The <b>~</b><u>user</u> part is replaced by the <u>user</u>'s home directory as defined in the <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> file.

       <b>|</b><u>command-line</u>
              Instead  of  writing  to a file, the articles are piped to the given shell (<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>) command-line.
              Each save or write command will create a separate pipe, but all articles saved or written  in  one
              command (in selection mode) are given as input to the same shell command.  Example:
                   | pr | lp
              This will print the articles on the printer after they have been piped through pr.
                  It  is  possible to create separate pipes for each saved article by using a double pipe symbol
              in the beginning of the command, e.g.
                   || cd <a href="file:~/src/nn">~/src/nn</a> ; patch

       The following symbols are expanded in a file name or command:

       <b>$F</b>     will be expanded to the name of the current group with  the  periods  replaced  by  slashes,  e.g.
              rec/music/synth.

       <b>$G</b>     will be expanded to the name of the current group.

       <b>$L</b>     will  be  expanded  to  the  <u>last</u> <u>component</u> of the name of the current group.  You may use this to
              create default save file names like +src/$L in the comp.sources groups.

       <b>$N</b>     will be expanded to the (local) article number, e.g. 1099.  In selection mode it is  only  allowed
              at the end of the file name!

       <b>$(VAR)</b> is replaced by the string value of the environment variable <u>VAR</u>.

       Using  these  symbols,  a  simple naming scheme for `default folder name' is <b>+$G</b> which will use the group
       name as folder name.  Another possibility is <b>+$F/$N</b>.

       As mentioned above, you can also instruct <u>nn</u> to save a series of files in separate,  unique  files.   All
       that is required is that the file name contains an asterisk, e.g.
            +src/hype/part*.shar
       This  will cause each of the articles to be saved in separate, unique files named part1.shar, part2.shar,
       and so on, always choosing a part number that results in a unique  file  name  (i.e.  if  part1.shar  did
       already exist, the first article would be saved in part2.shar, the next in part3.shar, and so on).

       <b>Related</b> <b>variables</b>: default-save-file, folder, folder-save-file, save-counter, save-counter-offset.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>GROUP</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>COMPLETION</b></h4><pre>
       When entering a file name or a news group name, a simple <b>completion</b> feature is available using the <b>space</b>,
       <b>tab</b>, and <b>?</b> keys.

       Hitting  <b>space</b>  anywhere  during input will complete the <u>current</u> <u>component</u> of the file name or group name
       with the <u>first</u> available possibility.

       If this possibility is not the one you want, keep on hitting <b>space</b> until it appears.

       When the right completion has appeared, you can just continue typing the file or group name, or  you  can
       hit  <b>tab</b> to fix the current component, and get the <u>first</u> possibility for the next component, and then use
       <b>space</b> to go through the other possible completions.

       The <b>?</b>  key will produce a list of the possible <u>completions</u> of the current component.  If the list is  too
       long for the available space on screen, the key can be repeated to get the next part of the list.

       The current completion can be deleted with the <b>erase</b> key.

       The  default value for a file name is the last file name you have entered, so if you enter a <b>space</b> as the
       first character after the prompt, the last file name will be repeated (and you can edit it if you  like).
       In  some cases, a string will already be written for you in the prompt line, and to get the default value
       in these cases, use the <b>kill</b> key.  This also means that if you neither want the initial  value,  nor  the
       default value, you will have to hit the <b>kill</b> twice to get a clean prompt line.

       <b>Related</b> <b>variables</b>: comp1-key, comp2-key, help-key, suggest-default-save.

</pre><h4><b>POSTING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>RESPONDING</b> <b>TO</b> <b>ARTICLES</b></h4><pre>
       In  both  selection  mode  and  reading mode you can post new articles, post follow-ups to articles, send
       replies to the author of an article, and you can send mail to another user with the option  of  including
       an article in the letter.  In reading mode, a response is made to the current article, while in selection
       mode you will be prompted for an article to respond to.

       The following commands are available (the lower-case equivalents are also available in reading mode):

       <b>R</b>    {<b>reply</b>}
              Reply  through  mail  to  the  author  of the article.  This is the preferred way to respond to an
              article unless you think your reply is of general interest.

       <b>F</b>    {<b>follow</b>}
              Follow-up with an article in the same newsgroup (unless an alternative group is specified  in  the
              article  header).  The distribution of the follow-up is normally the same as the original article,
              but this can be modified via the <b>follow-distribution</b> variable.

       <b>M</b>    {<b>mail</b>}
              Mail a letter or <u>forward</u> an article to a  single  recipient.   In  selection  mode,  you  will  be
              prompted  for  an  article to include in your letter, and in reading mode you will be asked if the
              current article should be included in the letter.  You will then be prompted for the recipient  of
              the  letter  (default  recipient  is  yourself)  and  the  subject of the letter (if an article is
              included, you may hit <b>space</b> to get the default subject  which  is  the  subject  of  the  included
              article).
                The  header  of  the  article is only included in the posted letter if it is forwarded (i.e. not
              edited), or if the variable <b>include-full-header</b> is set.

       <b>:post</b>     {<b>post</b>}
              Post a new article to any newsgroup.  This command will prompt you for a <u>comma-separated</u>  list  of
              newsgroups to post to (you cannot enter a space because <b>space</b> is used for group name completion as
              described below).
                If you enter <b>?</b> {<b>help-key</b>} as the first key, <u>nn</u> will show you a list of all available news groups
              and  their  purpose.  While paging through this list, you can enter <b>q</b> to quit looking at the list.
              You can also enter <b>/</b> followed by a regular expression (typically a single word) which  will  cause
              <u>nn</u> to show a (much shorter) list containing only the lines matching the regular expression.
                 Normally,  you  will be prompted for the distribution of the article with the default take from
              <b>default-distribution</b>, but this can be changed via the <b>post-distribution</b> variable.

       Generally, <u>nn</u> will construct a file with a suitable header, optionally include a copy of the  article  in
       the file with each non-empty line prefixed by a `&gt;' character (except in mail mode), and invoke an editor
       of your choice (using the EDITOR environment variable) on this file, positioning you on the first line of
       the body of the article (if it knows the editor).

       When  you  have  completed  editing the message, it will compare it to the unedited file, and if they are
       identical (i.e. you did not make any changes to the file), or it is empty, the  operation  is  cancelled.
       Otherwise  you  will  be  prompted  for  an action to take on the constructed article (enter first letter
       followed by <b>return</b>, or just <b>return</b> to take the default action):
           a)bort c)c e)dit h)old i)spell m)ail p)ost r)eedit s)end v)iew w)rite 7)bit
           Action: (post article)
       You now have the opportunity to perform one of the following actions:

         <b>a</b>    throw the response away (will ask for confirmation),
         <b>c</b>    mail a copy of a <u>follow-up</u> to the poster of the article,
         <b>e</b>    edit the file again,
         <b>h</b>    hold response for later completion,
         <b>i</b>    run an (interactive) <b>spell-checker</b> on the text,
         <b>m</b>    mail a (blind) copy to a specified recipient,
         <b>n</b>    same as <b>a</b>bort (<u>no</u> don't post),
         <b>p</b>    post article (same as <b>s</b>end),
         <b>r</b>    throw away the edited text and edit the original text,
         <b>s</b>    send the article or letter,
         <b>v</b>    view the article (through the <b>pager</b>),
         <b>w</b>    append it to a file (before you send it),
         <b>y</b>    confirm <u>default</u> <u>answer</u> (e.g. <u>yes</u> post it), or
         <b>7</b>    strip the high-order bit from all characters in the message

       If you have selected a 7-bit character set (this is determined by the values of the <b>charset</b> and <b>data-bits</b>
       variables), <u>nn</u> will not allow you to post an article or send a letter whose body contains characters with
       the high-order bit set. It will warn you after you have first edited the message  and  disable  the  c)c,
       m)ail,  p)ost,  s)end and y)es actions. You can then either e)dit the message to delete those characters,
       use 7)bit to strip the high-order bits, a)bort the message, or h)old it and select an 8-bit character set
       from <u>nn</u>.

       To complete an unfinished response saved by the h)old command, simply enter any response action,  e.g.  <b>R</b>
       {<b>reply</b>}.  This will notice the unfinished response and ask you whether you want to complete it now.  Only
       one  unfinished  response  can exist at a time.  Notice that the $A environment variable may no longer be
       valid as a path to the original article when the response is completed.

       If your message contains 8-bit characters, the <b>charset</b> variable is not set to "unknown" and  the  message
       does  not  already  have  a <b>MIME-Version</b> or <b>Content-</b><u>XXX</u> header, <u>nn</u> will add the following headers to your
       message before sending it:
            MIME-Version: 1.0
            Content-Type: text/plain; charset=<u>charset</u>
            Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
       It must be noted that sending 8-bit characters over the current news and mail networks is risky at  best;
       although  large  parts  of  the  network will pass through such characters unchanged, high-order bits may
       occasionally be stripped. Although the  MIME  standard  provides  solutions  for  this  by  encoding  the
       characters,  this  is  not  yet supported by <u>nn</u>.  Adding the above headers is an interim solution that is
       compatible with current practice and is much better than just sending the message without any hints about
       the character set used.

</pre><h4><b>JUMPING</b> <b>TO</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>GROUPS</b></h4><pre>
       By default <u>nn</u> will present the news groups in a predefined sequence  (see  the  section  on  Presentation
       Sequence  later  on).   To  override  this sequence and have a look at any other group the <b>G</b> {<b>goto-group</b>}
       command available in both selection and  reading  mode  enables  you  to  move  freely  between  all  the
       newsgroups.

       Furthermore,  the  <b>G</b>  command  enables you to open folders and other files, to read old articles you have
       read before, and to grep for a specific subject in a group.

       It is important to notice that normally the goto command is recursive, i.e. a new <u>menu</u> <u>level</u>  is  created
       when the specified group or folder is presented, and when it has been read, <u>nn</u> will continue the activity
       in  the  group  that  was  presented  before the goto command was executed.  However, if there are unread
       articles in the target group you can avoid entering a new menu level  by  using  the  <b>j</b>  reply  described
       below.   The current menu level (i.e. number of nested goto commands) will be shown in the prompt line as
       "&lt;N&gt;" (in reverse video).

       The goto command is very powerful, but unfortunately also a little bit tricky at first sight, because the
       facilities it provides depend on the context in which the command is used.

       When executed, the goto command will prompt you for the name of the newsgroup, folder, or file  to  open.
       It will use the first letter you enter to distinguish these three possibilities:

       <b>return</b> An empty answer is equivalent to the current newsgroup.

       <u>letter</u> The  answer  is taken to be the name of a newsgroup.  If a news group with the given name does not
              exist, <u>nn</u> will treat the answer as a  regular  expression  and  locate  the  first  group  in  the
              presentation sequence (or among all groups) whose name matches the expression.

       <u>+</u>
              The  answer  is taken to be the name of a folder.  If only `+' is entered, it is equivalent to the
              default save file for the current group.

       <u>/</u> <u>or</u> <u>./</u> <u>or</u> <u>~/</u>
              The answer is taken to be the name of a file, either relative to the current  directory,  relative
              to your home directory, or an absolute path name for the file.

       <b>%</b>      In  reading  mode,  this  reply  corresponds to reading the current article (and splitting it as a
              digest).  In selection mode, it will prompt for an article on the menu to read.

       <b>@</b>      This choice is equivalent to the archive file for the current group.

       <b>=</b> and <u>number</u>
              These answers are equivalent to the same answers described below  applied  to  the  current  group
              (e.g. <b>G</b> <b>return</b> <b>=</b> and <b>G</b> <b>=</b> are equivalent).

       Specifying  a  folder,  a  file, or an article (with <b>%</b>) will cause <u>nn</u> to treat the file like a digest and
       split it into separate articles (not physically!)  which are then presented on a menu in the  usual  way,
       allowing you to read or save individual subarticles from the folder.

       When  you enter a group name, <u>nn</u> will ask you how many articles in the group you want to see on the menu.
       You can give the following answers:

       <u>a</u> <u>number</u> <u>N</u>
              In this case you will get the newest N articles in the group, or  if  you  specified  the  current
              group  (by  hitting <b>return</b> to the group name prompt or entering the number directly), you will get
              that many <u>extra</u> articles included on the same menu (without creating a new menu level).

       <b>j</b>      This answer can only be given if there are unread articles in the group.  It will instruct  nn  to
              jump  directly  to  the  specified  group in the presentation sequence <u>without</u> creating a new menu
              level.

       <b>u</b>      This instructs <u>nn</u> to present the <u>unread</u> articles in the group (if there are  any).   If  you  have
              already read the group (in the current invocation of <u>nn</u>), the <b>u</b> answer will instruct <u>nn</u> to present
              the articles that were unread when you entered <u>nn</u>.

       <b>a</b>      This instruct <u>nn</u> to present <b>all</b> articles in the group.

       <b>s</b><u>word</u> or <b>=</b><u>word</u>
              This  instructs  <u>nn</u> to search <u>all</u> articles in the groups, but only present the articles containing
              the word <u>word</u> in the subject.  Notice that case is ignored when searching  for  the  word  in  the
              subject lines.

       <b>n</b><u>word</u>  Same as the <b>s</b> form except that it searched for articles where the sender <u>name</u> matches <u>word</u>.

       <b>e</b><u>word</u>  Same  as  the  <b>s</b> form except that it Psearched for articles where <u>either</u> the subject or the sender
              name matches <u>word</u>.

       <u>word</u> = <b>/</b><u>regexp</u>
              When the first character of the <u>word</u> specified with the <b>s</b>, <b>n</b>, and <b>e</b> forms is a slash `/', the rest
              of the input is interpreted as a regular expression to search for.  Notice that regular expression
              matching is case insensitive when <b>case-fold-search</b> is set (default).

       <b>return</b> The meaning of an empty answer depends on the  context:  if  there  are  unread  articles  in  the
              specified group the unread articles will be presented, otherwise <u>all</u> articles in the group will be
              included in the menu.

       If  you  specified  the  current group, and the menu already contains all the available articles, <u>nn</u> will
       directly prompt for a word to search for in the subject of all articles (the  prompt  will  be  an  equal
       sign.)

       When  the goto command creates a new menu level, <u>nn</u> will not perform auto kill or selection in the group.
       You can use the <b>+</b> command in menu mode to perform the auto-selections.

       There are three commands in the goto family:

       <b>G</b>    {<b>goto-group</b>}
              This is the general goto command described above.

       <b>B</b>    {<b>back-group</b>}
              Backup one or more groups.  You can hit this key one or more  times  to  go  back  in  the  groups
              already  presented  (including  those without new articles); when you have found the group you are
              looking for, hit <b>space</b> to enter it.

       <b>A</b>    {<b>advance-group</b>}
              Advance one or more groups.  This command is similar  to  the  <b>B</b>  command,  but  operates  in  the
              opposite direction.

       <b>N</b>    {<b>next-group</b>}
              When used within an <b>A</b> or <b>B</b> command, it skips forward to the next group in the sequence with unread
              articles or which has previously been visited.

       <b>P</b>    {<b>previous</b>}
              When used within an <b>A</b> or <b>B</b> command, it skips backwards to the preceding group in the sequence with
              unread articles or which has previously been visited.

       Once  you have entered an <b>A</b> or <b>B</b>command, you can freely mix the <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>P</b>, and <b>N</b> commands to find the group
       you want, and you can also use the <b>G</b> command to be prompted for a group name.

       To show the use of the goto command some typical examples on its use are given below:

       <u>Present</u> <u>the</u> <u>unread</u> <u>articles</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>dk.general</u> <u>group</u>
             <b>G</b> dk.general <b>return</b> <b>u</b>

       <u>Jump</u> <u>directly</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>gnu.emacs</u> <u>group</u> <u>and</u> <u>continue</u> <u>from</u> <u>there</u>
             <b>G</b> gnu.emacs <b>return</b> <b>j</b>

       <u>Include</u> <u>the</u> <u>last</u> <u>10</u> <u>READ</u> <u>articles</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>current</u> <u>group</u> <u>menu</u>
             <b>G</b> 10 <b>return</b>

       <u>Find</u> <u>all</u> <u>articles</u> <u>in</u> <u>rec.music.misc</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>subject</u> <u>Floyd</u>
             <b>G</b> rec.music.misc <b>return</b>
             <b>=</b> floyd <b>return</b>

       <u>Open</u> <u>the</u> <u>folder</u> <u>+nn</u>
             <b>G</b> +nn <b>return</b>

       <u>Split</u> <u>current</u> <u>article</u> <u>as</u> <u>a</u> <u>digest</u> <u>(in</u> <u>reading</u> <u>mode)</u>
             <b>G</b> <b>%</b>

</pre><h4><b>AUTOMATIC</b> <b>KILL</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SELECTION</b></h4><pre>
       When there is a subject or an author which  you  are  either  very  interested  in,  or  find  completely
       uninteresting,  you can easily instruct <u>nn</u> to <u>auto-select</u> or <u>auto-kill</u> articles with specific subjects or
       from specific authors.  These instructions are stored in a <u>kill</u>  <u>file</u>,  and  the  most  common  types  of
       entries can be created using the following command:

       <b>K</b>    {<b>kill-select</b>}
              Create an entry in your personal kill file.  The contents of the entry is specified during a short
              dialog  that  is  described  in  details  below.   This command is available in both selection and
              reading mode.

       Entries in the kill file may apply to a single newsgroup or to all newsgroups.  Furthermore, entries  may
       be permanent or they may be expired a given number of days after their entry.

       To increase performance, <u>nn</u> uses a compiled version of the kill file which is read in when <u>nn</u> is invoked.
       The compiled kill file will automatically be updated if the normal kill file has been modified.

       The following dialog is used to build the kill file entry:

       <u>AUTO</u> <u>(k)ill</u> <u>or</u> <u>(s)elect</u> <u>(CR</u> <u>=&gt;</u> <u>Kill</u> <u>subject</u> <u>30</u> <u>days)</u>
              If  you  simply  want  <u>nn</u> to kill all articles with the subject of the current article (in reading
              mode) or a specific article (which <u>nn</u> will prompt for in selection mode), just hit  <b>return</b>.   This
              will  cause  <u>nn</u>  to create an entry in the kill file to kill the current (or specified) subject in
              the current group for a period of 30 days (which should be enough for the discussion to die out).
              You can control the default kill period, or change it into a "select" period via the <b>default-kill-</b>
              <b>select</b> variable.
              If this "default behaviour" is not what you want, just answer either <u>k</u> or  <u>s</u>  to  kill  or  select
              articles, respectively, which will bring you on to the rest of the questions.

       <u>AUTO</u> <u>SELECT</u> <u>on</u> <u>(s)ubject</u> <u>or</u> <u>(n)ame</u>  <u>(s)</u>
              (The  <u>SELECT</u>  will  be  substituted with <u>KILL</u> depending on the previous answer).  Here you specify
              whether you want the kill or select to depend on the subject of the article (<b>s</b> or  <b>space</b>),  or  on
              the name of the author (<b>n</b>).

       <u>SELECT</u> <u>NAME:</u>
              (Again  <u>SELECT</u>  may  be substituted with <u>KILL</u> and <u>SUBJECT</u> may replace <u>NAME</u>).  You must now enter a
              name (or subject) to select (or kill).  In reading mode, you may just hit <b>return</b> (or <b>%</b>) to use the
              name (or subject) of the current article.  In selection mode, you can use the  name  (or  subject)
              from an article on the menu by answering with <b>%</b> followed by the corresponding article identifier.
              When the name or subject is taken from an article (the current or one from the menu), <u>nn</u> will only
              select  or  kill  articles  where the name or subject matches the original name or subject exactly
              including case.
              If the first character typed at the prompt is a slash `/', the rest of  the  line  is  used  as  a
              <u>regular</u> <u>expression</u> which is used to match the name or subject (case <u>in</u>sensitive).
              Otherwise, <u>nn</u> will select or kill articles which <u>contain</u> the specified string anywhere in the name
              or subject (ignoring case).

       <u>SELECT</u> <u>in</u> <u>(g)roup</u> <u>`dk.general'</u> <u>or</u> <u>in</u> <u>(a)ll</u> <u>groups</u>  <u>(g)</u>
              You  must  now  specify whether the selection or kill should apply to the current group only (<b>g</b> or
              <b>space</b>) or to all groups (<b>a</b>).

       <u>Lifetime</u> <u>of</u> <u>entry</u> <u>in</u> <u>days</u> <u>(p)ermanent</u>  <u>(30)</u>
              You can now specify the lifetime of the entry, either by entering a number specifying  the  number
              of  days  the  entry  should  be active, or <b>p</b> to specify the entry as a permanent entry.  An empty
              reply is equivalent to 30 days.

       <u>CONFIRM</u> <u>SELECT</u> <u>....</u>
              Finally, you will be asked to confirm the entry, and you should especially note  the  presence  or
              absence of the word <b>exact</b> which specify whether an exact match applies for the entry.

       <b>Related</b> <b>variables</b>: default-kill-select, kill.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>KILL</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The kill file consists of one line for each entry.  Empty lines and lines starting with a # character are
       ignored.  <u>nn</u> automatically places a # character in the first position of expired entries when it compiles
       the kill file.  You can then edit the kill file manually from time to time to clean out these entries.

       Each line has the following format
            [<u>expire</u> <u>time</u> :] [<u>group</u> <u>name</u>] : <u>flags</u> : <u>string</u> [: <u>string</u>]...

       Permanent  entries  have  no  <u>expire</u>  <u>time</u> (in which case the colon is omitted as well!).  Otherwise, the
       <u>expire</u> <u>time</u> defines the time (as a time_t value) when the entry should be expired.

       The <u>group</u> <u>name</u> field can have three forms:

       <u>news.group.name</u>
              If it is the name of a single news group (e.g. comp.unix), the entry applies to that group only.

       <b>/</b><u>regular</u> <u>expression</u>
              If it starts with a slash `/' followed by  a  <u>regular</u>  <u>expression</u>  (e.g.  /^news\..*),  the  entry
              applies to all groups whose name are matched by the regular expression.

       <u>empty</u>  An empty group field will apply the entry to <u>all</u> groups.

       The  <u>flags</u>  field  consists  of  a  list  of  characters  which  identifies  the  type  of entry, and the
       interpretation of each <u>string</u> field.  When used, the flag characters must be used in the order  in  which
       they are described below:

       <b>~</b>    (optional)
              When  this flag is present on any of the entries for a specific group, it causes all entires which
              <u>are</u> <u>not</u> <u>auto-selected</u> to be killed.  This is a simple way to say: I'm interested in this and that,
              but nothing else.

       <b>+</b>    or <b>!</b> (optional)
              Specify an auto-select <b>+</b> or an auto-kill <b>!</b> entry, respectively.  If neither are used, the  article
              is neither selected nor killed which is useful in combination with the `<b>~</b>' flag.

       <b>&gt;</b> (optional)
              When  used  with  a subject (flag <b>s</b>), the kill entry only matches follow-ups to that subject (i.e.
              where the Subject: line starts with Re:).  For example, to kill all "Re:"'s in rec.humor  use  the
              following kill entry: rec.humor:!&gt;s/:.

       <b>&lt;</b> (optional)
              When  used  with  a  subject (flag <b>s</b>), the kill entry only matches base articles with that subject
              (i.e. where the Subject: line does not start with Re:).  For example, to kill all articles  asking
              for help (but not follow-ups) in the tex group, add this to your kill file:
                   comp.text.tex:!s&lt;/:^HELP

       <b>n</b> or <b>s</b> or <b>a</b> (mandatory)
              Specify  whether the corresponding string applies to the name <b>n</b> or to the subject <b>s</b> of an article.
              If flag <b>a</b> is used, the corresponding string is ignored  (but  must  be  present),  and  the  entry
              applies to articles with a non-empty References: line.

       <b>/</b> (optional)
              Specifies  that  the  corresponding  <u>string</u> is a <b>regular</b> <b>expression</b> which the sender or subject is
              matched against.  If not specified, a simple string match is performed using the given <u>string</u>.

       <b>=</b> (optional)
              Specifies that the match against the name or subject is <u>case</u> <u>sensitive</u>.  Furthermore, when regular
              expression matching is <u>not</u> used, the name or subject must be of the same length of the  <u>string</u>  to
              match.  Otherwise, the match will be case insensitive, and a <u>string</u> may occur anywhere in the name
              or subject to match.

       <b>|</b> or <b>&amp;</b> (mandatory if multiple strings)
              If  more  than  one  string  is  specified,  the set of <u>flags</u> corresponding to each <u>string</u> must be
              separated by either an <u>or</u> <u>operator</u> `<b>|</b>' or an <u>and</u> <u>operator</u> `<b>&amp;</b>'.  The  and  operator  has  a  higher
              precedence  than  the or operator, e.g.  a complex match expression <u>a|b&amp;c|d</u> will succeed if either
              of <u>a</u>, <u>b&amp;c</u>, or <u>d</u> matches.

       The <u>string</u> field in the entry is the name, subject or regular expression that will be matched against the
       name or subject of each article in the group (or all groups).  Colons and  backslashes  must  be  escaped
       with a backslash in the string.

       Example 1:  Auto-select articles from `Tom Collins' (exact) on subject `News' in all groups:
           :+n=&amp;s:Tom Collins:News

       Example  2:  Kill all articles which are neither from `Tom' or `Eve' in some.group.  Select only articles
       from Eve:
           some.group:~n:Tom
           some.group:+n:Eve

       The second example can also be written as a  single  entry  with  an  or  operator  (in  this  case,  the
       select/kill attribute only applies to the succeeding strings):
           some.group:~n|+n:Tom:Eve

       To  remove  expired  entries, to "undo" a <b>K</b> command, and to make the more advanced entries with more than
       one string, you will have to edit the kill file manually.   To  recompile  the  file,  you  can  use  the
       <b>:compile</b>  command.   When  you invoke <u>nn</u>, it will also recompile the kill file if the compiled version is
       out of date.

</pre><h4><b>SHELL</b> <b>ESCAPES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>!</b>  commands available in selection and reading mode are identical in operation (with one  exception).
       When  you enter the shell escape command, you will be prompted for a shell command.  This command will be
       fed to the shell specified in the <b>shell</b> variable (default loaded from the SHELL environment  variable  or
       <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>) after the following substitutions have been performed on the command:

       <u>File</u> <u>name</u> <u>expansion</u>
              The earlier described file name expansions will be performed on all arguments.

       <b>$G</b>     will be substituted with the name of the current news group.

       <b>$L</b>     will be substituted with the <u>last</u> <u>component</u> of the name of the current news group.

       <b>$F</b>     will be substituted with the name of the current news group with the periods replaced by slashes.

       <b>$N</b>     will be substituted with the (local) article number (only defined in reading mode).

       <b>$A</b>     is  replaced  by  the  full  path name of the file containing the current article (only defined in
              reading mode).

       <b>%</b>      Same as $A.

       <b>$(VAR)</b> is replaced by the string value of the environment variable <u>VAR</u>.

       When the shell command is completed, you will be asked to hit any key to continue.  If you hit the <b>!</b>  key
       again, you will be prompted for a new shell command.  Any other key will redraw the screen and return you
       to the mode you came from.

       <b>Related</b> <b>variables</b>: shell, shell-restrictions.

</pre><h4><b>MISCELLANEOUS</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Below are more useful commands which are available in both selection and reading modes.

       <b>U</b>    {<b>unsub</b>}
              Unsubscribe to the current group.  You will not see this group  any  more  unless  you  explicitly
              request  it.   If  the  variable  <b>unsubscribe-mark-read</b>  is set, all articles in the group will be
              marked read when you unsubscribe.
                If the variable <b>keep-unsubscribed</b> is not set, the group will be removed from  .newsrc.   If  you
              are  not  subscribing to the group, you will be given the possibility to <u>resubscribe</u> to the group!
              This may be used in connection with the <b>G</b> command to resubscribe a group.

       <b>C</b>    {<b>cancel</b>}
              Cancel (delete) an article in the current group or folder.  Cancelling articles in a  folder  will
              cause  the  folder to be rewritten when it is closed.  In selection mode, you will be prompted for
              the identifier of the article to cancel.  Normal users can only cancel their  own  articles.   See
              also the section on folder maintenance.

       <b>Y</b>    {<b>overview</b>}
              Provide an overview of the groups with unread articles.

       <b>"</b>    {<b>layout</b>}
              Change  menu  layout  in  selection mode.  The menu will be redrawn using the next layout (cycling
              through ..., 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, ...)

       Most of the commands in <u>nn</u> are bound to a key and can be activated by a single keystroke.  However, there
       are a few commands that cannot be bound to a key directly.

       As shown in the keystroke command descriptions, all commands have a name, and it is possible to  activate
       a  command by name with the <u>extended</u> <u>command</u> key (<b>:</b>).  Hitting this key will prompt you for the name of a
       command (and parameters).  For example, an alternative to hitting the <b>R</b> key to reply to an article is  to
       enter  the  extended command <b>:reply</b> followed by <b>return</b>.  The <b>:post</b> and <b>:unshar</b> commands described earlier
       can also be bound to a key.  The complete list of commands which can be bound to keys is provided in  the
       section on Key Mappings below.

       The  following  extended  commands  <u>cannot</u>  be  bound  to  a  key, mainly because they require additional
       parameters on the prompt line, or because it should not be possible to activate them too easily.

       <b>:admin</b> Enter administrative mode.  This is identical in operation to the <u><a href="../man1M/nnadmin.1M.html">nnadmin</a></u>(1M) program.

       <b>:bug</b>   Prepare and send a bug report to the nn-bugs mailing address.

       <b>:cd</b> [ <u>directory</u> ]
              Change current working directory.  If the directory argument is not provided, <u>nn</u> will  prompt  for
              it.

       <b>:clear</b> Clear the screen (without redraw).  This may be useful at the beginning of the init file (possibly
              guarded by "on program nn"), or in some macros.

       <b>:compile</b>
              Recompile  the  <u>kill</u>  file.   This  is not necessary under normal operation since <u>nn</u> automatically
              compiles the file on start-up if it has changed, but it can be used if you modify  the  kill  file
              while <u>nn</u> is suspended.

       <b>:coredump</b>
              Abort with a core dump.  For debugging purposes only.

       <b>:define</b> <u>macro</u>
              Define  macro  number  <u>macro</u>  as  described  in  the  Macro Definition section below.  If <u>macro</u> is
              omitted, the next free macro number will be chosen.

       <b>:dump</b> <u>table</u>
              Same as the <b>:show</b> command described below.

       <b>:help</b> [ <u>subject</u> ]
              Provide online help on the specified subject.  If you omit the subject, a list  of  the  available
              topics will be given.

       <b>:load</b> [ <u>file</u> ]
              Load  the  specified  <u>file</u>.   If  the  <u>file</u>  argument  is omitted, the init file is reloaded.  The
              <b>sequence</b> part (if present) is ignored.

       <b>:local</b> <u>variable</u> [ <u>value</u> ]
              Make the variable local to the current group.  Subsequent changes to the  variable  will  only  be
              effective  until  the  current group is left.  If a value is specified, it will be assigned to the
              local variable.  To assign a new value to a boolean variable, the values <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> must be used.

       <b>:lock</b> <u>variable</u>
              Lock the specified <u>variable</u> so it cannot be modified.

       <b>:man</b>   Call up the online manual.  The manual is presented as a normal folder with the  program  name  in
              the `From' field and the section title in the `subject' field.  All the normal commands related to
              a folder works for the online manual as well, e.g. you can save and print sections of the manual.

       <b>:map</b> <u>arguments</u>
              This  is  the  command  used  for  binding commands to the keys.  It is fully described in the Key
              Mapping section below.

       <b>:mkdir</b> [ <u>directory</u> ]
              Create the directory (and the directories in its path).  It will prompt for at directory  name  if
              the argument is omitted.

       <b>:motd</b>  Show  the  <u>message</u>  <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>day</u> (maintained by the news administrator in the file "motd" in the lib
              directory.  This file is automatically displayed on start-up  whenever  it  changes  if  the  <b>motd</b>
              variable is set.

       <b>:pwd</b>   Print path name of current working directory on message line.

       <b>:q</b>     Has  no  effect  besides  redrawing the screen if necessary.  If an extended command (one which is
              prefixed by a :) produces any output requiring the screen to be redrawn, the screen  will  not  be
              redrawn  immediately  if  the  variable  <b>delay-redraw</b>  is set (useful on slow terminals).  Instead
              another <b>:</b> prompt is shown to allow you to  enter  a  new  extended  command  immediately.   It  is
              sufficient  to  hit  <b>return</b>  to  redraw  the screen, but it has been my experience that entering <b>q</b>
              <b>return</b> in this situation happens quite often, so it was made a no-op.

       <b>:q!</b>    Quit <u>nn</u> without updating the <b>.newsrc</b> file.

       <b>:Q</b>     Quit <u>nn</u>.  This is equivalent to the normal <b>Q</b> command.

       <b>:rmail</b> Open your mailbox (see the <b>mail</b> variable) as a folder to read the incoming messages.  This is  <u>not</u>
              a  full mail interface (depending on the nn configuration, you may not be able to delete messages,
              add cc: on replies, etc), but it can give you a quick glance at new mail without leaving <u>nn</u>.

       <b>:set</b> <u>variable</u> [ <u>value</u> ]
              Set a boolean variable to true or assign the value to a string  or  integer  variable.   The  <b>:set</b>
              command is described in details in the section on VARIABLES.

       <b>:sh</b>    Suspend <u>nn</u>, or if that is not possible, spawn an interactive shell.

       <b>:show</b> <b>groups</b> <u>mode</u>
              Show  the  total  number or the number of unread articles in the current group, depending on <u>mode</u>:
              <b>all</b> (list the number of unread articles in all groups including groups which you have unsubscribed
              to), <b>total</b> (list the total number of articles in  all  existing  groups),  <b>sequence</b>  (list  unread
              groups  in  presentation  sequence  order),  <b>subscr</b>  (list  all  subscribed  groups),  <b>unsub</b> (list
              unsubscribed groups only).  Any other <u>mode</u> results in a listing of the number of  unread  articles
              in  all  subscribed  groups  including those you have suppressed with the `!'  symbol in the group
              presentation sequence.  To get just the currently unread groups in the presentation sequence,  use
              the `Y' {<b>overview</b>} command.

       <b>:show</b> <b>kill</b>
              Show the kill entries that applies to the current group and to all groups.

       <b>:show</b> <b>rc</b> [ <u>group</u> ]
              Show the .newsrc and select file entries for the current or the specified group.

       <b>:show</b> <b>map</b> [ <u>mode</u> ]
              Show the key bindings in the current or specified mode.

       <b>:sort</b> [ <u>mode</u> ]
              Reorder  the  articles  on the menu according to <u>mode</u> or if omitted to the default <b>sort-mode</b>.  The
              following sorting modes are available:
              <b>arrival</b>: list articles by local article number which will be the same as the order in  which  they
              arrived on the system (unless groups are merged),
              <b>subject</b>:  articles with identical subjects are grouped and ordered after age of the oldest article
              in the group,
              <b>lexical</b>: subjects in lexicographical order,
              <b>age</b>: articles ordered after posting date only,
              <b>sender</b>: articles ordered after sender's name.

       <b>:toggle</b> <u>variable</u>
              Toggle a boolean variable.

       <b>:unread</b> [ <u>group</u> ] [ <u>articles</u> ]
              Mark the current (or specified) group as unread.  If the <u>articles</u> argument is omitted, the  number
              of  unread articles in the group will be set to the number of unread articles when <u>nn</u> was invoked.
              Otherwise, the argument specifies the number of unread articles.

       <b>:unset</b> <u>variable</u>
              Set a boolean variable to false or clear an integer variable.

       <b>:x</b>     Quit <u>nn</u> and <b>mark</b> all articles in the current group as <u>read</u>!

       <b>Related</b> <b>variables</b>: backup, bug-report-address,  delay-redraw,  keep-unsubscribed,  unsubscribe-mark-read,
       mail, pager, sort-mode.

</pre><h4><b>CATCH</b> <b>UP</b></h4><pre>
       If  you have not read news for some time, there are probably more news than you can cope with.  Using the
       option -<b>a0</b> <u>nn</u> will put you into <b>catch-up</b> <b>mode</b>.

       The first question you will get is whether to catch up interactively or automatically.  If  you  instruct
       <u>nn</u>  to  catch up automatically, it will simply mark all articles in all groups as read, thus bringing you
       <u>completely</u> <u>up-to-date</u>.

       If you choose the interactive mode, <u>nn</u> will locate all groups with unread articles, and for each group it
       will prompt you for an action to take on the group.  An action is selected using a single letter followed
       by <b>return</b>.  The following actions are available:

       <b>y</b>      Mark all articles as read in current group.

       <b>n</b>      Do not update group (this is the default action if you just hit <b>return</b>).

       <b>r</b>      Enter reading mode to read the group.

       <b>U</b>      Unsubscribe to the group.

       <b>?</b>      Give a list of actions.

       <b>q</b>      Quit.  When you quit, <u>nn</u> will ask whether the rest of the groups should be updated unconditionally
              or whether they should remain unread.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       It is possible to control the behaviour of <u>nn</u> through  the  setting  (and  unsetting)  of  the  variables
       described below.  There are several ways of setting variables:
       - Through command line options when <u>nn</u> is invoked.
       - Through <u>assignments</u> on the command line when <u>nn</u> is invoked.
       - Through global <b>set</b> commands in the init file.
       - Through <b>set</b> or <b>local</b> commands executed from entry macros.
       - Through the <b>:set</b> extended command when you run <u>nn</u>.

       There are four types of variables:
       - Boolean variables
       - Integer variables
       - String variables
       - Key variables

       Boolean  variables  control  a  specific  function  in <u>nn</u>, e.g.  whether the current time is shown in the
       prompt line.  A boolean variable is set to <b>true</b> with the command
            <b>set</b> <u>variable</u>
       and it is set to <b>false</b> with either of the following (equivalent) commands:
            <b>unset</b> <u>variable</u>
            <b>set</b> <b>no</b><u>variable</u>

       You can also toggle the value of a boolean variable using the command:
            <b>toggle</b> <u>variable</u>

       For example:
            <b>set</b> time
            <b>unset</b> time
            <b>set</b> notime
            <b>toggle</b> time

       Integer variables control an amount e.g. the size of  the  preview  window,  or  the  maximum  number  of
       articles to read in each group.  They are set with the following command:
            <b>set</b> <u>variable</u> <u>value</u>
       In  some  cases,  not  setting  an integer value has a special meaning, for example, not having a minimal
       preview window or reading all articles in the groups no matter how many there are.  The  special  meaning
       can be re-established by the following command:
            <b>unset</b> <u>variable</u>
       For example:
            <b>set</b> window 7
            <b>unset</b> limit

       String  variables  may  specify directory names, default values for prompts, etc.  They are set using the
       command
            <b>set</b> <u>variable</u> <u>string</u>
       Normally, the <u>string</u> value assigned to the <u>variable</u> value starts at the first non-blank  character  after
       the  variable  name  and  ends  with  the  last non-blank character (excluding comments) on the line.  To
       include leading or trailing blanks, or the comment start symbol, #, in the string they  must  be  escaped
       using  a  backslash  `\',  e.g. to set <b>included-mark</b> to the string " # ", the following assignment can be
       used:
            set included-mark  \ \#\   # blank-#-blank
       To include a backslash in the string, it must be duplicated `\\'.   A  backslash  may  also  be  used  to
       include  the following special characters in the string: \a=alarm, \b=backspace, \e=escape, \f=form-feed,
       \n=new-line, \r=return, \t=tab.

       Key variables control the keys used to control special functions during user input such as  line  editing
       and completion.  They are set using the command
            <b>set</b> <u>variable</u> <u>key-name</u>

       A variable can be <u>locked</u> which makes further modification of the variable impossible:
            <b>lock</b> <u>variable</u>
       This  can  be used in the <u>setup</u> init file which is loaded unconditionally to enforce local conventions or
       restrictions.  For example, to fix the <b>included-mark</b> variable to the string "&gt;", the  following  commands
       can be placed in the setup file:
            <b>set</b> included-mark &gt;
            <b>lock</b> included-mark
       Some  variables  only  make sense when set on the command line, since they are examined early in startup,
       before the init files are read.  The syntax for setting variables on the command line is:
            <b>variable</b>=<u>value</u>
       The value may need to be quoted if it contains white space or special characters.  They can be intermixed
       with other options, and are examined prior to other argument parsing.

       The current variable settings can be shown with the <b>:set</b> command:

       <b>:set</b> (without arguments)
              This will give a listing of the variables  which  have  been  set  in  either  the  init  file  or
              interactively.

       <b>:set</b> <b>all</b>
              This will give a listing of all variables.  Modified variables will be marked with a `*' and <u>local</u>
              variables will be marked with a `&gt;'.  A locked variable is marked with a `!'.

       <b>:set</b> <b>/</b><u>regexp</u>
              This will give a listing of all variables whose name matches the given regular expression.

       <b>:set</b> <u>partial-name</u> <b>space</b>
              The  <b>space</b>  (<b>comp1-key</b>) key will complete the variable name as usual, but as a side effect it will
              display the variable's current value in the message line.

       Variables are global by default, but a local instantiation of the  variable  can  be  created  using  the
       <b>:local</b>  command.   The  local  variable  will overlay the global variable as long as the current group is
       active, i.e. the global variable will be used again when you exit the current group.  The  initial  value
       of  the  local  variable  will be the same as the global variable, unless a new value is specified in the
       <b>:local</b> command:
            <b>:local</b> <u>variable</u> [ <u>value</u> ]

       The following variables are available:

       <b>also-full-digest</b>    (boolean, default false)
              When a digest is split, the digest itself is not normally included on the menu, and  as  such  the
              initial  administrative  information  is  not  available.  Setting <b>also-full-digest</b> will cause the
              (unsplit) digest to be included on the menu.  These articles are marked with a @ at the  beginning
              of the subject.

       <b>also-subgroups</b> (boolean, default true)
              When set, a group name in the presentation sequence will also cause all the subgroups of the group
              to  be  included,  for  example, comp.unix will also include comp.unix.questions, etc.  When <b>also-</b>
              <b>subgroups</b> is not set, subgroups are only included if the group name is followed by a `.' in  which
              case  the  main  group  is  <u>not</u>  included,  i.e.  `comp.unix' is not included when `comp.unix.' is
              specified in the presentation sequence, and vice-versa.  Following a group  name  by  an  asterisk
              `*', e.g. comp.unix*, will include the group as well as all subgroups independently of the setting
              of <b>also-subgroups</b>.

       <b>append-signature-mail</b>    (boolean, default false)
              When false, it is assumed that the .signature file is automatically appended to responses sent via
              E-mail.  If true, .signature will be appended to the letter (see query-signature).

       <b>append-signature-post</b>    (boolean, default false)
              When  false,  it is assumed that the .signature file is automatically appended to posted articles.
              If true, .signature will explicitly be appended to posted articles (see query-signature).

       <b>attributes</b> <u>symbols</u>  (string, default ....)
              Each element in this string represents a symbol  used  to  represent  an  article  attribute  when
              displayed on the screen.  See the section on Marking Articles and Attributes.

       <b>auto-junk-seen</b> <u>(boolean,</u> <u>default</u> <u>true)</u>
              When set, articles which have the <u>seen</u> <u>attribute</u> (,) will be marked read when the current group is
              left.   If  not  set,  these articles will still be either unread or marked seen the next time the
              group is entered (see also <b>confirm-junk-seen</b> and <b>retain-seen-status</b><u>).</u>

       <b>auto-preview-mode</b>        (boolean, default false)
              Enables <u>Auto</u> <u>Preview</u> <u>Mode</u>.  In this mode, selecting an article on the menu using  its  article  id
              (letter  a-z)  will  enter  preview mode on that article immediately.  Furthermore, the `n' {<b>next-</b>
              <b>article</b>} command will preview the next article on the menu only if it has the same subject as  the
              current article; otherwise, it will return to the menu with the cursor placed on the next article.
              The  <b>continue</b>  command  at  the  end  of  the  article and the `=' {<b>goto-menu</b>} returns to the menu
              immediately as usual.

       <b>auto-read-mode-limit</b> <u>N</u>   (integer, default 0)
              When operating in <u>auto</u> <u>reading</u> <u>mode</u>, <u>nn</u> will <u>auto-select</u> all unread articles in  the  group,  skip
              the article selection phase, and enter reading mode directly after entry to the group.
                Auto reading mode is disabled when <b>auto-read-mode-limit</b> is zero; it is activated unconditionally
              if  the  value  is negative, and conditionally if the value is greater than zero and the number of
              unread articles in the current group does not exceed the given value.

       <b>auto-select-closed</b> <u>mode</u>  (integer, default 1)
              Normally, selecting a <u>closed</u> <u>subject</u> (usually in consolidated menu mode) will select (or deselect)
              all <u>unread</u> articles with the given subject (or all articles if they are all read).  This behaviour
              can be changed via the value of this variable as follows:
              0: select only the first article with the subject (shown on menu).
              1: select only the unread articles with the subject.
              2: select all available articles with the subject.

       <b>auto-select-rw</b> (boolean, default false)
              If set, a subject of an article read or posted is automatically used for subsequent auto-selecting
              (if not already selected).  This is the most efficient way to see your own posts automatically.

       <b>auto-select-subject</b> (boolean, default false)
              When set, selecting an article from the menu using the article id (a-z), all articles on the  menu
              with the same subject will automatically be selected as well.

       <b>backup</b>    (boolean, default true)
              When  set,  a  copy  of  the initial .newsrc and select files will save be the first time they are
              changed.  <u>nn</u> remembers the initial contents of these files internally, so the backup variable  can
              be set any time if not set on start-up.

       <b>backup-folder-path</b> <u>file</u>  (string, default "BackupFolder~")
              When  removing  deleted articles from a folder, this variable defines the name of the file where a
              (temporary) copy of the original folder is saved.  If the <u>file</u> name doesn't  contain  a  `/',  the
              file  will  be  located  in  the  .nn  directory.  Otherwise the file name is used directly as the
              relative or full path name of the backup file.  If possible, the old folder will be renamed to the
              backup folder name; otherwise the old folder is copied to the backup folder.

       <b>backup-suffix</b> <u>suffix</u>     (string, default ".bak")
              The suffix appended to file names to make the corresponding backup file name (see <b>backup</b>).

       <b>bug-report-address</b> <u>address</u>    (string, default <a href="mailto:mtpins@nndev.org">mtpins@nndev.org</a>)
              The mail address to which bug reports created with the <b>:bug</b> command are sent.

       <b>case-fold-search</b>         (boolean, default true)
              When set, string and regular expression matching will be case independent.  This is related to all
              commands matching on names or subjects, except in connection with auto-kill and auto-select  where
              the individual kill file entries specifies this property.

       <b>charset</b> <u>charset</u>     (string, default "us-ascii")
              The character set in use on your terminal. Legal values are "us-ascii", "iso-8859-<u>X</u>", where <u>X</u> is a
              nonzero  digit,  and  "unknown".   Setting  this  variable also sets the <b>data-bits</b> variable to the
              default bit width of the character set (7 for "us-ascii" and "unknown",  8  for  the  "iso-8859-<u>X</u>"
              sets).
              The  value  of  this  variable  also  determines whether <u>nn</u> allows 8-bit characters in the body of
              articles being posted and letters being mailed (unless the value is "unknown", in which case  this
              is determined by the value of the <b>data-bits</b> variable).  If necessary, <u>nn</u> will add extra headers to
              the message indicating its the character set.

       <b>check-group-access</b>  (boolean, default false)
              When  set,  <u>nn</u> will perform a check on the readability of a group's readability before showing the
              menu for that group.  Normally, this is not necessary since all users traditionally have access to
              all news groups.  Setting (and locking) this variable may be used to limit access to a news  group
              via the permissions and ownership of the group's spool directory (this will only work for non-NNTP
              sites).

       <b>collapse-subject</b> <u>offset</u>  (integer, default 25)
              When  set  (non-negative),  subject  lines which are too long to be presented in full on the menus
              will be "collapsed" by removing a sufficient number of characters from the subject starting at the
              given <u>offset</u> in the subject.  This is useful in source groups  where  the  "Part  (01/10)"  string
              sometimes disappears from the menu.  When not set (or negative), the subjects are truncated.

       <b>columns</b> <u>col</u>    (integer, default screen width)
              This variable contains the screen width i.e. character positions per line.

       <b>comp1-key</b> <u>key</u>  (key, default <b>space</b>)
              The  key  which  gives the first/next completion, and the default value when <u>nn</u> is prompting for a
              string, e.g. a file name.

       <b>comp2-key</b> <u>key</u>  (key, default <b>tab</b>)
              The key which ends the current completion and gives the first completion for  the  next  component
              when <u>nn</u> is prompting for a string, e.g. a file name.

       <b>compress</b>       (boolean, default false)
              This  variable  controls  whether  text compression (see the <b>compress</b> command) is turned on or off
              when an article is shown.  The compression is still toggled  for  the  current  article  with  the
              <b>compress</b> command key.

       <b>confirm-append</b>      (boolean, default false)
              When  set,  <u>nn</u> will ask for confirmation before appending an article to an existing file (see also
              <b>confirm-create</b>).

       <b>confirm-auto-quit</b>        (boolean, default false)
              When set, <u>nn</u> will ask for confirmation before quitting after having read the last group.   If  not
              confirmed, <u>nn</u> will recycle the presentation sequence looking for groups that were skipped with the
              `N'  {<b>next-group</b>}  command.  But it will not look for new articles arrived since the invocation of
              <u>nn</u>.

       <b>confirm-create</b>      (boolean, default true)
              When set, <u>nn</u> will ask for confirmation before creating a new file  or  directory  when  saving  or
              unpacking an article (see also <b>confirm-append</b>).

       <b>confirm-entry</b>       (boolean, default false)
              When  set, <u>nn</u> will ask for confirmation before entering a group with more than <b>confirm-entry-limit</b>
              unread articles (on the first menu level).  It is useful on slow terminals if you  don't  want  to
              wait until <u>nn</u> has drawn the first menu to be able to skip the group.
                Answering  no to the "Enter?" prompt will cause <u>nn</u> to skip to the next group without marking the
              current group as read.  If you answer by hitting <b>interrupt</b>, <u>nn</u> will  ask  the  question  "Mark  as
              read?" which allows you to mark the current group as read before going to the next group.  If this
              second question is also answered by hitting <b>interrupt</b>, <u>nn</u> will quit immediately.

       <b>confirm-entry-limit</b> <u>articles</u>  (integer, default 0)
              Specifies  the  minimum  number  of  unread  articles  in  a  group  for  which  the <b>confirm-entry</b>
              functionality is activated.

       <b>confirm-junk-seen</b>        (boolean, default false)
              When set, <u>nn</u> will require confirmation before marking seen articles as read when <b>auto-junk-seen</b> is
              set.

       <b>confirm-messages</b>         (boolean, default false)
              In some cases, <u>nn</u> will sleep one second (or more) when it has shown a message to the user, e.g. in
              connection with macro debugging.  Setting <b>confirm-messages</b> will  cause  <u>nn</u>  to  <u>wait</u>  for  you  to
              confirm  all  messages  by  hitting  any  key.  (It will show the symbol &lt;&gt; to indicate that it is
              awaiting confirmation.)

       <b>consolidated-manual</b> (boolean, default false)
              When set, the <u>online</u> <u>manual</u> will be presented with one menu  line  for  each  <u>program</u>  in  the  <u>nn</u>
              package.

       <b>consolidated-menu</b>        (boolean, default false)
              When set, <u>nn</u> will automatically <u>close</u> all multi-article subjects on entry to a group, so that each
              subject only occur once on the menu page.

       <b>counter-delim-left</b>  (string, default "[")
              The delimiter string output to the left of the article counter in a closed subject's menu line.

       <b>counter-delim-right</b> (string, default "] ")
              The delimiter string output to the right of the article counter in a closed subject's menu line.

       <b>counter-padding</b> <u>pad</u>      (integer, default 5)
              On a consolidated menu, the subjects may not be very well aligned because the added [...] counters
              have varying length.  To (partially) remedy this, all counters (and subjects without counters) are
              prefixed by up to <u>pad</u> spaces to get better alignment.  Increasing it further may yield practically
              perfect alignment at the cost of less space for the subject itself.

       <b>cross-filter-seq</b>         (boolean, default true)
              When  set,  cross posted articles will be presented in the first possible group, i.e. according to
              the  current  presentation  sequence  (<u>cross</u>-post  <u>filter</u>ing  on  <u>seq</u>uence).    The   article   is
              automatically  marked  read  in  the other cross posted groups unless you unsubscribe to the first
              group in which it was shown before reading the other groups.  Likewise, it is sufficient to  leave
              the article unread in the first group to keep it for later handling.
                If  not set, cross-postings are shown in the first group occurring on the Newsgroups: line which
              the user subscribes to (i.e. you let the poster decide which group is most appropriate to read his
              posting).

       <b>cross-post</b>          (boolean, default false)
              Normally, <u>nn</u> will only show cross-posted articles in the first subscribed group on the Newsgroups:
              line.  When <b>cross-post</b> is set, <u>nn</u> will show cross-posted articles  in  all  subscribed  groups  to
              which they are posted.

       <b>cross-post-limit</b> <u>N</u>        (integer, default 0)
              If  this  variable  is  set  to  a  value  other  than  0, then any articles posted to more than <u>N</u>
              newsgroups are automatically skipped.  A value  of  5  is  pretty  good  for  discarding  ``spam''
              articles.

       <b>data-bits</b> <u>bits</u> (integer, default 7)
              When  set to 7, <u>nn</u> will display characters with the 8th bit set using a meta-notation <b>M-</b><u>7bit-char</u>.
              If set to 8, these characters are sent directly to the screen (unless <b>monitor</b> is set). Setting the
              <b>charset</b> variable also sets this variable to the default bit width of character set.
              It also controls whether keyboard input is 7 or 8 bits, and thus whether key maps contain  127  or
              255 entries.  See the key mapping section for more details.
              If the <b>charset</b> has value "unknown", the value of <b>data-bits</b> also determines whether <u>nn</u> allows 8-bit
              characters  in  the  body  of  articles  being  posted  and letters being mailed (this is normally
              determined directly by the <b>charset</b> variable).

       <b>date</b>      (boolean, default true)
              If set <u>nn</u> will show the article posting date when articles are read.

       <b>debug</b> <u>mask</u>     (integer, default 0)
              Look in the source if you are going to use this.

       <b>decode-header-file</b> <u>file</u>  (string, default "Decode.Headers")
              The name of the file in which the header and initial text of articles  decoded  with  the  <b>:decode</b>
              command  is  saved.   Unless the file name starts with a `/', the file will be created in the same
              directory as the decoded files.  The information is not saved if this variable is not set.

       <b>decode-skip-prefix</b> <u>N</u>     (integer, default 2)
              When non-null, the <b>:decode</b> command will automatically skip <u>up</u> <u>to</u> <u>N</u> characters at the beginning  of
              each  line  to  find  valid  uuencoded  data.  This allows <u>nn</u> to automatically decode (multi-part)
              postings which are both uuencoded and packed with shar.

       <b>default-distribution</b> <u>distr</u>    (string, default "world")
              The distribution to use as the default suggestion when posting articles using the <b>follow</b> and  <b>post</b>
              commands  if  the  corresponding  <b>follow-distribution</b>  or  <b>post-distribution</b> variable contains the
              <b>default</b> option.

       <b>default-kill-select</b> <u>[1]days</u>   (number, default 30)
              Specifies the default action for the <b>K</b> {<b>kill-select</b>} command if the first prompt  is  answered  by
              <b>return</b>.   It  contains  the number of days to keep the kill or select entry in the kill file (1-99
              days).  If it has the value <u>days</u>+100 (e.g. 130), it denotes that the default action is  to  <u>select</u>
              rather than kill on the subject for the specified period.

       <b>default-save-file</b> <u>file</u>   (string, default +$F)
              The  default  save  file  used  when  saving  articles  in news groups where no save file has been
              specified in the init file (either in a <b>save-files</b> section or in the presentation  sequence).   It
              can  also  be  specified using the abbreviation "+" as the file name when prompted for a file name
              even in groups with their own save file.

       <b>delay-redraw</b>        (boolean, default false)
              Normally, <u>nn</u> will redraw the screen after extended commands (:cmd) that clear  the  screen.   When
              <b>delay-redraw</b>  is  set  <u>nn</u> will prompt for another extended command instead of redrawing the screen
              (hit <b>return</b> to redraw).

       <b>echo-prefix-key</b>          (boolean, default true)
              When true, hitting a prefix key (see the section on key mapping below) will cause the  prefix  key
              to be echoed in the message line to indicate that another key is expected.

       <b>edit-patch-command</b>  (boolean, default true)
              When true, the <b>:patch</b> command will show the current <b>patch-command</b> and give you a chance to edit it
              before applying it to the articles.

       <b>edit-print-command</b>  (boolean, default true)
              When  true,  the <b>print</b> command will show the current <b>printer</b> command and give you a chance to edit
              it before printing the articles.  Otherwise the  articles  are  just  printed  using  the  current
              <b>printer</b> command.

       <b>edit-response-check</b> (boolean, default true)
              When  editing  a response to an article, it normally does not have any meaning to send the initial
              file prepared by <u>nn</u> unaltered, since it is either empty or only contains included material.   When
              this  variable is set, exiting the editor without having changed the file will automatically abort
              the response action without confirmation.

       <b>edit-unshar-command</b> (boolean, default false)
              When true, the <b>:unshar</b> command will show the current <b>unshar-command</b> and give you a chance to  edit
              it before applying it to the articles.

       <b>editor</b> <u>command</u> (string, default not set)
              When  set, it will override the current EDITOR environment variable when editing responses and new
              articles.

       <b>embedded-header-escape</b> <u>string</u> (string, default '~')
              When saving an article to a file, header lines embedded in the body of  the  article  are  escaped
              using  this  string  to  make it possible for <u>nn</u> to split the folder correctly afterwards.  Header
              lines are not escaped if this variable is not set.

       <b>enter-last-read-mode</b> <u>mode</u>     (integer, default 1)
              Normally, <u>nn</u> will remember which group is active when you quit, and offer to jump directly to this
              group when you start <u>nn</u> the next time.  This variable is used  to  control  this  behaviour.   The
              following <u>mode</u> values are recognized:
              0: Ignore the remembered group (r.g.).
              1: Enter r.g. if the group is unread (with user confirmation)
              2: Enter r.g. or first unread group after it in the sequence (w/conf).
              3: Enter r.g. if the group is unread (no confirmation)
              4: Enter r.g. or first unread group after it in the sequence (no conf).

       <b>entry-report-limit</b> <u>articles</u>   (integer, default 300)
              Normally,  <u>nn</u> will just move the cursor to the upper left corner of the screen while it is reading
              articles from the database on entry to a group.  For large  groups  this  may  take  more  than  a
              fraction of a second, and <u>nn</u> can then report what it is doing.  If it must read more articles than
              the  number  specified  by  this  variable, <u>nn</u> will report which group and how many articles it is
              reading.

       <b>erase-key</b> <u>key</u>  (key, default tty erase key)
              The key which erases the last input character when <u>nn</u> is prompting for a string, e.g. a file name.

       <b>expert</b>         (boolean, default false)
              If set <u>nn</u> will use slightly shorter prompts (e.g. not tell you that ? will give you help), and  be
              a  bit  less  verbose  in  a  few  other  cases  (e.g. not remind you that posted articles are not
              available instantly).

       <b>expired-message-delay</b> <u>pause</u>   (integer, default 1)
              If a selected article is found to have been expired, <u>nn</u> will normally give a  message  about  this
              and  sleep for a number of seconds specified by this variable.  Setting this variable to zero will
              still make <u>nn</u> give the message without sleeping afterwards.  Setting  it  to  -1  will  cause  the
              message not to be shown at all.

       <b>flow-control</b>   (boolean, default true)
              When  set,  <u>nn</u>  will  turn  on  xon/xoff  flow-control before writing large amounts of text to the
              screen.  This should guard against lossage of output, but in some network  configurations  it  has
              had  the  opposite  effect,  losing  several lines of the output.  This variable is always true on
              systems with CBREAK capabilities which can  do  single  character  reads  without  disabling  flow
              control.

       <b>flush-typeahead</b>     (boolean, default false)
              When true, <u>nn</u> will flush typeahead prior to reading commands from the keyboard.  It will not flush
              typeahead while reading parameters for a command, e.g. file names etc.

       <b>folder</b> <u>directory</u>    (string, default <a href="file:~/News">~/News</a>)
              The  full  pathname  of the <u>folder</u> <u>directory</u> which will replace the + in folder names.  It will be
              initialized from the FOLDER environment variable if it is not set in the <u>init</u> file.

       <b>folder-format-check</b> (boolean, default true)
              When saving an article with a full or partial header in an existing  folder,  <u>nn</u>  will  check  the
              format  of  the folder to be able to append the article in the proper format.  If this variable is
              not set, folders are assumed to be in the format specified via  the  <b>mmdf-format</b>  and  <b>mail-format</b>
              variables,  and  articles  are  saved  in  that  format without checking.  Otherwise, the <b>*-format</b>
              variables are only used to determine the format for <u>new</u> folders.

       <b>folder-save-file</b> <u>file</u>    (string, default not set)
              The default save file used when saving articles <u>from</u> a folder.

       <b>follow-distribution</b> <u>words</u>     (string, default see below)
              This variable controls how the Distribution: header is constructed for a follow-up to an  original
              article.  Its value is a list of <u>words</u> selected from the following list:
              [ [ <b>always</b> ] <b>same</b> ] [ <b>ask</b> ] [ <b>default</b> | <u>distribution</u> ]
              This is interpreted in two steps:
              - First the default distribution is determined.  If <b>same</b> is specified and the original article has
              a  Distribution:  header,  that  header is used.  Else if <b>default</b> is specified (or <u>distribution</u> is
              omitted), the value of <b>default-distribution</b> is used.  And finally, if  only  a  <u>distribution</u>  (any
              word) is specified that is used as the default.
              -  Then if <b>ask</b> is specified, the user will be asked to confirm the default distribution or provide
              another distribution.  However, if <b>always</b> (and <b>same</b>) is specified, and the default was taken  from
              the original article's distribution, the original distribution is used <u>without</u> confirmation.
              The  default  value  of  <b>follow-distribution</b>  is <b>always</b> <b>same</b> <b>default</b>, i.e. use either the original
              distribution or the <b>default-distribution</b> without confirmation in either case.

       <b>from-line-parsing</b> <u>strictness</u>  (integer, default 2)
              Specifies how strict <u>nn</u> must parse a "From " line in a folder to recognize it  as  a  mail  format
              message  separator  line.   The following strictness values determine whether a line starting with
              "From " will be recognized as a separator line:
                   0: Always.
                   1: Line must have at least 8 fields.
                   2: Line must contain a valid date and time (ctime style).

       <b>fsort</b>          (boolean, default true)
              When set, folders are sorted alphabetically according to the subject (and  age).   Otherwise,  the
              articles in a folder will be presented in the sequence in which they were saved.

       <b>guard-double-slash</b>  (boolean, default false)
              Normally, when entering a file name, entering two slashes `//' in a row (or following a slash by a
              plus  `/+')  will cause <u>nn</u> to erase the entire line and replace it with the `/' (or `+').  On some
              systems, two slashes are used in network file names, and on those systems  <b>guard-double-slash</b>  can
              be set; that will cause <u>nn</u> to require <u>three</u> slashes in a row to clear the input.

       <b>header-lines</b> <u>list</u>   (string, no default)
              When  set,  it determines the list of header fields that are shown when an article is read instead
              of the normal one line header showing the author and subject.  See the  full  description  in  the
              section on Customized Article Headers below.

       <b>help-key</b> <u>key</u>   (key, default <b>?</b>)
              The  key  which  ends the current completion and gives a list of possible completions for the next
              component when <u>nn</u> is prompting for a string, e.g. a file name.

       <b>ignore-re</b>      (boolean, default false)
              If set, articles with subjects already seen in a previous invocation of nn or another newsreader -
              and not auto-selected - are automatically killed.  A great way to read even less news!

       <b>ignore-xon-xoff</b>          (boolean, default false)
              Normally, <u>nn</u> will ignore ^S and ^Q in the input from the terminal (if they are not handled in  the
              tty driver).  Setting this variable will treat these characters as normal input.

       <b>include-art-id</b>      (boolean, default false)
              The  first  line  in  a  response  with  included material normally reads "...somebody... writes:"
              without a reference to the specific article from which the quotation was taken (this is  found  in
              the  References:  line).   When this variable is set, the line will also include the article id of
              the referenced article: "In ...article... ... writes:".

       <b>include-full-header</b> (boolean, default false)
              When set, the <b>mail</b> (M) command will always include the full header of the original article.  If it
              is not set, it only includes the header when the article is forwarded without being edited.

       <b>include-mark-blank-lines</b> (boolean, default false)
              When set, the <b>included-mark</b> is placed on blank lines in included articles.  Otherwise, blank lines
              are left blank (to make it easy to delete whole paragraphs with `d}' in vi and `C-@  M-]  C-W'  in
              emacs).

       <b>included-mark</b> <u>string</u>     (string, default "&gt;")
              This  string  is  prefixed  to all lines in the original article that are included in a reply or a
              follow-up.  (Now you have the possibility to change it, but please don't.  Lines with a mixture of
              prefixes like
                 : orig-&gt; &lt;&gt; } ] #- etc.
              are very difficult to comprehend.  Let's all use the standard folks!  (And hack inews if it is the
              50% rule that bothers you.)

       <b>inews</b> <u>shell-command</u> (string, default "INEWS_PATH -h")
              The program which is invoked by <u>nn</u> to deliver an article to the news transport.  The program  will
              be  given  a complete article including a header containing the newsgroups to which the article is
              to be posted.  See also <b>inews-pipe-input</b>.  It is <u>not</u> used when cancelling an article!

       <b>inews-pipe-input</b>         (boolean, default true)
              When set, the article to be posted will be piped into the  <b>inews</b>  program.   Otherwise,  the  file
              containing the article will be given as the first (and only) argument to the <b>inews</b> command.

       <b>initial-newsrc-file</b> <u>file</u> (string, default '.defaultnewsrc')
              Defines  the name of a file which is used as the initial .newsrc file for new users.  The name may
              be a full path name, or as the default a file name which will be looked for in a number of places:
              in the standard news lib directory (where it can be shared with other news readers), in  nn's  lib
              directory,  and  in  the  database directory.  Groups which are not present in the initial .newsrc
              file will be automatically unsubscribed provided <b>new-group-action</b>  is  set  to  a  value  allowing
              unsubscribed groups to be omitted from .newsrc.

       <b>keep-backup-folder</b>  (boolean, default false)
              When set, the backup folder (see <b>backup-folder-path</b>) created when removing deleted articles from a
              folder  is  not  removed.   Notice that a backup folder is not created if all articles are removed
              from a folder!

       <b>keep-unsubscribed</b>        (boolean, default true)
              When set, unsubscribed groups are kept in .newsrc.  If not set, <u>nn</u> will automatically  remove  all
              unsubscribed from .newsrc if <b>tidy-newsrc</b> is set.  See also <b>unsubscribe-mark-read</b>.

       <b>kill</b>      (boolean, default true)
              If set, <u>nn</u> performs automatic kill and selection based on the <u>kill</u> file.

       <b>kill-debug</b>          (boolean, default false)
              When  set,  <u>nn</u>  will  display  a trace of the auto-kill/select process on entry to a group.  It is
              automatically turned off if `q' is entered as the answer to a "hit  any  key"  prompt  during  the
              debug output.

       <b>kill-key</b> <u>key</u>   (key, default tty kill key)
              The key which deletes the current line when <u>nn</u> is prompting for a string, e.g. a file name.

       <b>kill-reference-count</b> <u>N</u>   (integer, default 0)
              When  this  variable  is non-zero, all articles which have <u>N</u> or more references on the References:
              line (corresponding to the number of &gt;&gt;'s on the menu line) will be auto-killed if  they  are  not
              auto-selected  (or  preserved)  via  an  entry  in  the kill file.  It should probably not be used
              globally for all groups, but can be set on a per-group via the entry macros.

       <b>layout</b> <u>number</u>  (integer, default 1)
              Set the menu layout.  The argument must be a number between 0 and 4.

       <b>limit</b> <u>max-articles</u>  (integer, default infinite)
              <u>Limit</u> the maximum number of articles presented in each group to <u>max-articles.</u>  The default  is  to
              present  <u>all</u>  unread  articles no matter how many there are.  Setting this variable, only the most
              recent <u>max-articles</u> articles will be presented, but all the articles will still be marked as read.
              This is useful to get up-to-date quickly if you have not read news for a longer period.

       <b>lines</b> <u>lin</u> (integer, default screen height)
              This variable contains the screen height i.e. number of lines.

       <b>long-menu</b>      (boolean, default false)
              If set <u>nn</u> will not put an empty line after the header line and an empty  line  before  the  prompt
              line; this gives you two extra menu lines.

       <b>macro-debug</b>    (boolean, default false)
              If  set  <u>nn</u>  will  trace  the  execution of all macros.  Prior to the execution of each command or
              operation in a macro, it will show the name of the command or the input string or  key  stroke  at
              the bottom of the screen.

       <b>mail</b> <u>file</u> (string, default not set)
              <u>file</u>  must be a full path name of a file.  If defined, <u>nn</u> will check for arrival of new mail every
              minute or so by looking at the specified file.

       <b>mail-alias-expander</b> <u>program</u>   (string, default not set)
              When set, aliases used in mail responses may be expanded by the specified  <u>program</u>.   The  program
              will  be  given  the  completed response in a file as its only argument, and the aliases should be
              expanded directly in this file (of course the <u>program</u> may use temporary files and other  means  to
              expand the aliases as long the the result is stored in the provided file).
              Notice: currently there are no alias expanders delivered with <u>nn</u>.
              Warning: Errors in the expansion process may lead to the response not being sent.

       <b>mail-format</b>    (boolean, default false)
              When  set,  <u>nn</u> will save articles in a format that is compatible with normal mail folders.  Unless
              <b>folder-format-check</b> is false, it is only used to specify the format  used  when  new  folders  are
              created.  This variable is ignored if <b>mmdf-format</b> is set.

       <b>mail-header</b> <u>headers</u> (string, default not set)
              The  <u>headers</u>  string specifies one or more extra header lines (separated by semi-colons `;') which
              are added to the header of mail sent from <u>nn</u> using the <b>reply</b> and <b>mail</b> commands.  For example:
                   set mail-header Reply-To: <a href="mailto:storm@texas.dk">storm@texas.dk</a>;Organization: TI - DK
              To include a semicolon `;' in a header, precede it by a backslash (which must be  doubled  because
              of the conventions for entering strings).

       <b>mail-record</b> <u>file</u>    (string, default not set)
              <u>file</u>  must  be a full path name of a file.  If defined, all replies and mail will be saved in this
              file in standard <u>mailbox</u> format, i.e. you can use you favourite mailer (and <u>nn</u>)  to  look  at  the
              file.

       <b>mail-script</b> <u>file</u>    (string, default not set)
              When  set,  <u>nn</u>  will  use the specified file instead of the standard <u>aux</u> script when executing the
              <b>reply</b> and <b>mail</b> commands.

       <b>mailer</b> <u>shell-command</u>     (string, default REC_MAIL)
              The program which is invoked by <u>nn</u> to deliver a message to the mail transport.  The  program  will
              be  given a complete mail message including a header containing the recipient's address.  See also
              <b>mailer-pipe-input</b>.

       <b>mailer-pipe-input</b>        (boolean, default true)
              When set, the message to be sent will be piped into  the  <b>mailer</b>  program.   Otherwise,  the  file
              containing the message will be given as the first (and only) argument to the <b>mailer</b> command.

       <b>marked-by-next-group</b> <u>N</u>   (integer, default 0)
              Specifies  the amount of (unmarked) articles on the menu marked <u>seen</u> by the <b>N</b> {<b>next-group</b>} command
              in selection mode.  See <b>marked-by-read-skip</b> for possible values of <u>N</u>.

       <b>marked-by-read-return</b> <u>N</u>  (integer, default 0)
              Specifies the amount of (unmarked) articles on the menu marked <u>seen</u> by the <b>Z</b> {<b>read-return</b>} command
              in selection mode.  See <b>marked-by-read-skip</b> for possible values of <u>N</u>.

       <b>marked-by-read-skip</b> <u>N</u>    (integer, default 4)
              Specifies the amount of (unmarked) articles on the menu marked <u>seen</u> by the <b>X</b>  {<b>read-skip</b>}  command
              in selection mode.  The following values of <u>N</u> are recognized:
                   0:  No articles are marked seen
                   1:  Current page is marked seen
                   2:  Previous pages are marked seen
                   3:  Previous and current pages are marked seen
                   4:  All pages are marked seen

       <b>mark-overlap</b>   (boolean, default false)
              When  set,  <u>nn</u>  will draw a line (using the underline capabilities of the terminal if possible) to
              indicate the end of the overlap (see the <b>overlap</b> variable).

       <b>mark-overlap-shading</b>     (boolean, default false)
              When set, <u>nn</u> will <u>shade</u> overlapping lines (see the <b>overlap</b> variable) using the attributes  defined
              by  the  <b>shading-on</b> and <b>shading-off</b> variables (of if not set, with the underline attribute).  This
              is typically used to give overlapping lines a  different  colour  on  terminals  which  have  this
              capability.

       <b>menu-spacing</b> <u>mode</u>   (integer, default 0)
              When  <u>mode</u>  is  a non-zero number as described below, <u>nn</u> will add blank lines between the lines on
              the menu to increase readability at the cost of presenting  fewer  articles  on  each  page.   The
              following values of <u>mode</u> are recognized:
              0: Don't add blank lines between menu lines.
              1: Add a blank line between articles with <u>different</u> subjects.
              2: Add a blank line between <u>all</u> articles.

       <b>merge-report-rate</b> <u>rate</u>   (integer, default 1)
              When  <u>nn</u>  is  invoked  with the -m option (directly or via <u>nngrap</u>), a status report of the merging
              process is displayed and updated on the screen every <u>rate</u> seconds.  The report contains  the  time
              used so far and an estimate of the time needed to complete the merge.

       <b>message-history</b> <u>N</u>   (integer, default 15)
              Specifies  the  maximum  number,  <u>N</u>, of older messages which can be recalled with the <b>^P</b> {<b>message</b>}
              command.

       <b>min-window</b> <u>size</u>     (integer, default 7)
              When the <b>window</b> variable is not set, <u>nn</u> will clear the screen to preview an article if  there  are
              less than <u>size</u> unused lines at the bottom of the menu screen.

       <b>mmdf-format</b>    (boolean, default false)
              When  set,  <u>nn</u> will save articles in MMDF format.  Unless <b>folder-format-check</b> is false, it is only
              used to specify the format used when new folders are created.

       <b>monitor</b>        (boolean, default false)
              When set, <u>nn</u> will show <u>all</u> characters in the received messages  using  a  "cat  -v"  like  format.
              Otherwise, only the printable characters are shown (default).

       <b>motd</b>      (boolean, default true)
              When  set,  <u>nn</u> will display the <u>message</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>day</u> on start-up if it has changed since it was last
              shown.  The message is taken from the file "motd" in the lib directory.   It  can  also  be  shown
              (again) using the <b>:motd</b> command.

       <b>multi-key-guard-time</b> <u>timeout</u>  (integer, default 2)
              When  reading  a  multi-key sequence from the keyboard, <u>nn</u> will expect the characters constituting
              the multi-key to arrive "quickly" after each other.  When a partial multi-key sequence is read, <u>nn</u>
              will wait (at least) <u>timeout</u> tenths of a second for each of the following characters to arrive  to
              complete  the  multi-key sequence.  If the multi-key sequence is <u>not</u> completed within this period,
              <u>nn</u> will read the partial multi-key sequence as individual characters  instead.   This  way  it  is
              still  possible  to use for example the ESC key on a terminal with vt100 like arrow keys.  When <u>nn</u>
              is used via an rlogin connection, you may have to increase the timeout to get reliable recognition
              of multi-keys.

       <b>new-group-action</b> <u>action</u>  (integer, default 3)
              This variable controls how new groups are treated by <u>nn</u>.  It  is  an  integer  variable,  and  the
              following  values can be used.  Some of these actions (marked with an *) will only work when <b>keep-</b>
              <b>unsubscribed</b> is set, since the presence of a group in .newsrc is the only way to recognize  it  as
              an old group:
              <b>0</b>)  Ignore groups which are not in .newsrc.  This will obviously include new groups, and therefore
              you  must explicitly add any new groups that you care about (by editing the <u>.newsrc</u> file, or using
              the <b>G</b> menu command and then subscribing to the group).  When <b>NNTP</b>  is  being  used,  this  setting
              prevents  the  <u>active.times</u> data from being read from the server; this can be helpful when using a
              slow link, since the data can often be hundreds of KBytes long.
              <b>1</b>*)  Groups not in .newsrc are considered to be new, and are inserted  at  the  beginning  of  the
              .newsrc file.
              <b>2</b>*)   Groups  not  in .newsrc are considered to be new, and are appended to the end of the .newsrc
              file.
              <b>3</b>)  New groups are recognized via a time-stamp saved in the file .nn/LAST  and  in  the  database,
              i.e.  it  is  not  dependent on the groups currently in .newsrc.  The new groups are automatically
              appended to .newsrc with subscription.  Old groups not present in .newsrc will be considered to be
              unsubscribed.
              <b>4</b>)  As <b>3</b>, but the user is asked to confirm that the new group should be appended to  .newsrc.   If
              rejected, the group will not be appended to .newsrc, and thus be regarded as unsubscribed.
              <b>5</b>)   As  <b>4</b>,  except  that the information is stored in a format compatible with the <u>rn</u> news reader
              (.rnlast).  This needs to be tested!

       <b>new-style-read-prompt</b>    (boolean, default true)
              When set, the reading mode prompt line includes the group name and the number of selected articles
              in the group.

       <b>news-header</b> <u>headers</u> (string, default not set)
              The <u>headers</u> string specifies one or more extra header lines (separated by semi-colons  `;')  which
              are  added to the header of articles posted from <u>nn</u> using the <b>follow</b> and <b>post</b> commands.  See <b>mail-</b>
              <b>header</b> for an example.

       <b>news-record</b> <u>file</u>    (string, default not set)
              Save file for follow-ups and postings.  Same rules and format as the <b>mail-record</b> variable.

       <b>news-script</b> <u>file</u>    (string, default not set)
              When set, <u>nn</u> will use the specified file instead of the standard <u>aux</u>  script  when  executing  the
              <b>follow</b> and <b>post</b> commands.

       <b>newsrc</b> <u>file</u> (string, default "<a href="file:~/.newsrc">~/.newsrc</a>") Specifies the
              file  used  by  <u>nn</u>  to  register  which  groups  and articles have been read.  The default setting
              corresponds to the .newsrc file used by other news readers.  Notice that <u>nn</u>  release  6.4  onwards
              <u>does</u>  <u>allow</u>  individual articles to be marked unread, and some articles marked unread, and thus no
              longer messes up .newsrc for other news readers!  Also see <u>nntp-server</u>.

       <b>nn-directory</b> <u>directory</u>   (string, default "<a href="file:~/.nn">~/.nn</a>")
              It only makes sense to set this variable on the command line, e.g. "nn-directory=$HOME/.nn2" since
              it is looked at before the init file is read.  It must be set to a  full  pathname.   Usually  set
              when using multiple servers; see <u>newsrc</u> above and <u>nntp-server</u> below.

       <b>nntp-cache-dir</b> <u>directory</u> (string, default "<a href="file:~/.nn">~/.nn</a>")
              When  NNTP is used, <u>nn</u> needs to store articles temporarily on disk.  This variable specifies which
              directory <u>nn</u> will use to hold these files.  The default value may be changed during configuration.
              This variable can only be set in the init file.

       <b>nntp-cache-size</b> <u>size</u>     (integer, default 10, maximum 10)
              Specifies the number of temporary files in the nntp cache.  The default and maximum values may  be
              changed during configuration.

       <b>nntp-debug</b>     (boolean, default false)
              When set, a trace of the nntp related traffic is displayed in the message line on the screen.

       <b>nntp-server</b> <u>hostname</u> or <u>filename</u> <u>(string)</u>
              It only makes sense to set this variable on the command line, e.g. "nntp-server=news.some.domain",
              since  it is looked at before the init file, If you use multiple servers, you probably want to set
              the <u>nn-directory</u> and <u>newsrc</u> variables on the command line to alternate names as well,  since  some
              of the data files are server dependent.

       <b>old</b> [<u>max-articles</u>]  (integer, default not set)
              When  <b>old</b>  is set, <u>nn</u> will present (or scan) all (or the last <u>max-articles</u>) unread as well as read
              articles.  While <b>old</b> is set, <u>nn</u> will <u>never</u> mark any unread articles as read.

       <b>old-packname</b>   (boolean, default false)
              When set, nn display names identically to nn-6.6.5 (and earlier).  Only set this  if  you  have  a
              large  number of entries in your killfile that no longer work due to the new behaviour.  Note that
              in the long run, this option will go away, so it's best to update your killfile  rather  than  set
              this.

       <b>orig-to-include-mask</b> <u>N</u>   (integer, default 3)
              When  replying  to  an  article,  <u>nn</u>  will  include  some of the header lines which may be used to
              construct a proper mail address for the poster of  the  original  article.   These  addresses  are
              placed  on  <u>Orig-To:</u> lines in the reply header and will automatically be removed before the letter
              is sent.  This variable specifies which headers from the article are included; its value <u>N</u> is  the
              sum of the following values:
                   1: <u>Reply-To:</u>
                   2: <u>From:</u>
                   4: <u>Path:</u>

       <b>overlap</b> <u>lines</u>  (integer, default 2)
              Specifies the number of overlapping lines from one page to the next when paging through an article
              in reading mode.  The last line from the previous page will be underlined if the terminal has that
              capability.

       <b>pager</b> <u>shell-command</u>      (string, default $PAGER)
              This is the pager used by the <b>:admin</b> command (and <u>nnadmin</u>) when it executes certain commands, e.g.
              grepping in the Log file.

       <b>patch-command</b> <u>shell-command</u>   (string, default "patch -p0")
              This is the command which is invoked by the <b>:patch</b> command.

       <b>post-distribution</b> <u>words</u>  (string, default see below)
              This  variable  controls  how  the  Distribution:  header  is constructed when posting an original
              article.  Its value is a list of <u>words</u> selected from the following list:
              [ <b>ask</b> ] [ <b>default</b> | <u>distribution</u> ]
              This is interpreted in two steps:
              - First the default distribution is determined.  If  <b>default</b>  is  specified  (or  <u>distribution</u>  is
              omitted),  the  value of <b>default-distribution</b> is used.  Otherwise, the specified <u>distribution</u> (any
              word) is used as the default.
              - Then if <b>ask</b> is specified, the user will be asked to confirm the default distribution or  provide
              another distribution.
              The  default  value  of  <b>post-distribution</b>  is <b>ask</b> <b>default</b>, i.e. use the <b>default-distribution</b> with
              confirmation from the user.

       <b>preview-continuation</b> <u>cond</u>     (integer, default 12)
              This variable determines on what terms the following article should be  automatically  shown  when
              previewing an article, and the <b>next-article</b> command is used, or <b>continue</b> is used at the end of the
              article.  The following values can be used:
              <b>0</b> - never show the next article (return to the menu).
              <b>1</b> - always show the next article (use 'q' to return to the menu).
              <b>2</b>  -  show  the next article if it has the same subject as the current article, else return to the
              menu.
              The value should be the <u>sum</u> of two values: one for the action after using  <b>continue</b>  on  the  last
              page  of  the  article,  and  one  for  the action performed when the <b>next-article</b> command is used
              <u>multiplied</u> <u>by</u> <u>10</u>.

       <b>preview-mark-read</b>        (boolean, default true)
              When set, previewing an article will mark the article as read.

       <b>previous-also-read</b>  (boolean, default true)
              When set, going back to the previously read group with <b>P</b> {<b>previous</b>} will include articles read  in
              the current invocation of <u>nn</u> even if there are still unread articles in the group.

       <b>print-header-lines</b> <u>fields</u>     (string, default "FDGS")
              Specifies  the  list  of  header  fields that are output when an article is printed via the <b>:print</b>
              command and <b>print-header-type</b> is 1 (short header).  The <u>fields</u> specification is described  in  the
              section on Customized Article Headers below.

       <b>print-header-type</b> <u>N</u> (integer, default 1)
              Specifies  what kind of header is printed by the <b>:print</b> command, corresponding to the three <b>save-*</b>
              commands: <u>0</u> prints only the article body (no header), <u>1</u> prints a short header, and  <u>2</u>  prints  the
              full article header.

       <b>printer</b> <u>shell-command</u>    (string, default is system dep.)
              This  is  the default value for the <b>print</b> command.  It should include an option which prevents the
              spooler from echoing a job-id or similar to the terminal to avoid problems  with  screen  handling
              (e.g. lp -s on System V).

       <b>query-signature</b>          (boolean, default ...)
              Will  cause  <u>nn</u>  to require confirmation before appending the .signature file to out-going mail or
              news if the corresponding <b>append-sig-</b>... variable is set.

       <b>quick-count</b>    (boolean, default true)
              When set, calculating the  total  number  of  unread  articles  at  start-up  is  done  by  simple
              subtracting the first unread article number from the total number of articles in each group.  This
              is very fast, and fairly accurate but it may be a bit too large.  If not set, each line in .newsrc
              will  be  interpreted  to  count  every  unread article, thus giving a very accurate number.  This
              variable is also used by <u>nncheck</u>.

       <b>quick-save</b>     (boolean, default false)
              When set, <u>nn</u> will not prompt for a file name when an article is saved  (unless  it  belongs  to  a
              folder).   Instead  it  uses the save file specified for the current group in the init file or the
              default save file.

       <b>re-layout</b> <u>N</u>         (integer, default 0)
              Normally on the menu, <u>nn</u> will prefix the subject a number of `&gt;'s corresponding to the  number  of
              references  on  the References: line.  The <b>re-layout</b> variable may be set to use a different prefix
              on the subjects:
                   0:  One `&gt;' per reference is shown (default).
                   1:  A single `&gt;' is shown if the Subject contains Re:.
                   2:  The number of references is shown as `n&gt;'
                   3:  A single Re: is shown.
                   4:  If any references use layout 0, else layout 1.

       <b>re-layout-read</b> <u>N</u>    (integer, default -1)
              When the <b>header-lines</b> variable is not set, or contains the "*" field specifier, a line similar  to
              the  menu  line  will be used as the header of the article in reading mode, including the sender's
              name and the article's subject.  When this variable is negative, the subject on this  header  line
              will be prefixed according to the <b>re-layout</b> variable.  Otherwise, it will define the format of the
              "Re:" prefix to be used instead of the <b>re-layout</b> used on the menu.

       <b>read-return-next-page</b>    (boolean, default false)
              When  set,  the  <b>Z</b> {<b>read-return</b>} command will return to the <u>next</u> menu page rather than the current
              menu page.

       <b>record</b> <u>file</u>    (string, no default)
              Setting this <u>pseudo</u> variable will set both the <b>mail-record</b> and the <b>news-record</b>  variables  to  the
              specified pathname.

       <b>repeat</b>         (boolean, default false)
              When  set,  <u>nn</u>  will  not eliminate duplicated subject lines on menus (I cannot imagine why anyone
              should want that, but....)

       <b>repeat-group-query</b>  (boolean, default false)
              When set, invoking <u>nn</u> with the <b>-g</b> option will always repeat the query for a group to  enter  until
              you quit explicitly.  (Same as setting the <b>-r</b> option permanently).

       <b>report-cost</b>         (boolean, default true)
              This  variable is ignored unless <u>nn</u> is running with accounting enabled (see <u>nnacct</u>).  When set, <u>nn</u>
              will report the cost of the current session and the total on exit.

       <b>response-check-pause</b> <u>pause</u>    (integer, default 2)
              Specifies the number of seconds to wait after posting an article to see whether the action *might*
              have failed.  Some commands run in the background and may thus  not  have  completed  during  this
              period,  so  even when <u>nn</u> says "Article posted", it may still fail (in which case you are informed
              via mail).

       <b>response-default-answer</b> <u>action</u>     (string, default "send")
              The default action to be taken when hitting <b>return</b> to the "response action" prompt  (abort,  edit,
              send, view, write).  If it is unset, no default action is defined.

       <b>retain-seen-status</b>  (boolean, default false)
              Normally,  seen  articles will just be unread the next time the group is entered (unless they were
              marked read by <b>auto-junk-seen</b>).  If <b>retain-seen-status</b> is set, the seen attribute on the  articles
              will  survive  to  the  next  time  the group is entered.  (This is not recommended because it may
              result in very large select files).

       <b>retry-on-error</b> <u>times</u>     (integer, default 0)
              When set, <u>nn</u> will try the specified number of <u>times</u> to open an article before reporting  that  the
              article does not exist any more.  This may be necessary in some network environments.

       <b>save-closed-mode</b> <u>mode</u>    (integer, default 13)
              When saving an article in selection mode (i.e. by selecting it from the menu), <u>nn</u> will simply save
              the  specified article if the article's subject is <u>open</u>.  When the selected menu entry is a closed
              subject, the <b>save-closed-mode</b> variable determines how many  articles  among  the  closed  articles
              should be saved:
              0: save root article (the one on the menu) only
              1: save selected articles within subject
              2: save unread (excl selected) articles within subject
              3: save selected+unread articles within subject
              4: save all articles within subject
              If  `10'  is added to the above values, <u>nn</u> will not save the selected subject immediately; instead
              it will ask which articles to save using the above value as the default answer.

       <b>save-counter</b> <u>format</u> (string, default "%d")
              This is the printf-format which <u>nn</u> uses to create substitution string for the trailing *  in  save
              file  names.   You  can  set  this  to  more complex formats if you like, but be sure that it will
              produce different strings for different numbers.  An alternative format which seems to be  popular
              is ".%02d" .

       <b>save-counter-offset</b> <u>N</u>    (integer, default 0)
              Normally,  file  names  created with the <u>part.*</u> form will substitute the <u>*</u> with successive numbers
              starting from one.  Setting this variable will cause these numbers to start from <u>N</u>+1.

       <b>save-header-lines</b> <u>fields</u> (string, default "FDNS")
              Specifies the list of header fields that are saved when an article is saved via the <b>O</b> {<b>save-short</b>}
              command.  The <u>fields</u> specification is described in  the  section  on  Customized  Article  Headers
              below.

       <b>save-report</b>    (boolean, default true)
              When set, a message reporting the number of lines written is shown after saving an article.  Since
              messages  are  shown for a few seconds, this may slow down the saving of many articles (e.g. using
              the <b>S*</b> command).

       <b>scroll-clear-page</b>        (boolean, default true)
              Determines whether <u>nn</u> clears the screen before showing each new page of an article.

       <b>scroll-last-lines</b> <u>N</u>      (integer, default 0)
              Normally, <u>nn</u> will show each new page of an article from the top of the screen (with proper marking
              of the overlap).  When this variable is set to a negative value, <u>nn</u> will scroll the  text  of  the
              new  pages  from the bottom of the screen instead.  If it is set to a positive value, <u>nn</u> will show
              pages from the top as usual, but switch to scrolling when there are <u>less</u> <u>than</u> the specified number
              of lines left in the article.

       <b>select-leave-next</b>        (boolean, default false)
              When set, you will be asked whether to select articles with the <b>leave-next</b> attribute on entry to a
              group with left over articles.

       <b>select-on-sender</b>         (boolean, default false)
              Specifies whether the <b>find</b> (=) command in article selection mode will match on the subject or  the
              sender.

       <b>shading-on</b> <u>code</u>...  (control string, default not set)
              Specifies the escape code to be sent to the terminal to cause "shading" of the following output to
              the  screen.   This  is  used  if the <b>mark-overlap-shading</b> is set, and by the `+' attribute in the
              <b>header-lines</b> variable.

       <b>shading-off</b> <u>code</u>... (control string, default not set)
              Specifies the escape code to be sent to the terminal to turn off the shading defined  by  <b>shading-</b>
              <b>on</b>.  Shading will typically be done by changing the foreground colour to change, e.g.
                   on term ti924-colour
                        set shading-on  ^[ [ 3 2 m
                        set shading-off ^[ [ 3 7 m
                        set mark-overlap-shading
                        unset mark-overlap
                   end

       <b>shell</b> <u>program</u>  (string, default $SHELL)
              The shell program used to execute shell escapes.

       <b>shell-restrictions</b>  (boolean, default false)
              When  set (in the init file), <u>nn</u> will not allow the user to invoke the shell in any way, including
              saving on pipes.  It also prevents the user from changing certain variables containing commands.

       <b>show-purpose-mode</b> <u>N</u>      (integer, default 1)
              Normally, <u>nn</u> will show the purpose of a group the first time it is read,  provided  a  purpose  is
              known.  Setting this variable, this behaviour can be changed as follows:
                   0:  Never show the purpose.
                   1:  Show the purpose for new groups only.
                   2:  Show the purpose for all groups.
              When  <b>NNTP</b> is being used, a setting of 0 prevents the newsgroups purpose data from being read from
              the server; this can be helpful when using a slow link, since the data can often  be  hundreds  of
              KBytes long.

       <b>sign-type</b>      (string, default pgp)
              What  program  nn  will use to sign messages via the Sign command.  Only <u>pgp</u> and <u>gpg</u> are currently
              valid.

       <b>silent</b>         (boolean, default false)
              When set, <u>nn</u> won't print the logo or "No News" if there are no unread articles.   Only  useful  to
              set in the init file or with the <b>-Q</b> option.

       <b>slow-mode</b>      (boolean, default false)
              When  set,  <u>nn</u>  will  cut  down  on  the  screen output to give better response time at low speed.
              Normally, <u>nn</u> will use standout mode (if possible) to mark selected articles on the menu, but  when
              <b>slow-mode</b>  is  set,  <u>nn</u>  will  just put an asterisk `*' next to the article identifier on selected
              articles.  Also when <b>slow-mode</b> is set <u>nn</u> will avoid redrawing the screen in the  following  cases:
              After  a  <b>goto-group</b>  command  an  empty  menu  is  shown (hit <b>space</b> to make it appear), and after
              responding to an article, only the prompt line is shown (use ^L to redraw the screen).   To  avoid
              redrawing the screen after an extended command, set the <b>delay-redraw</b> variable as well.

       <b>slow-speed</b> <u>speed</u>    (integer, default 1200)
              If the terminal is running at this baud rate or lower, the <b>on</b> <b>slow</b> (see the section on init files)
              condition will be true, and the <b>on</b> <b>fast</b> will be false (and vice-versa).

       <b>sort</b>      (boolean, default true)
              When  set,  <u>nn</u>  will  sort  articles  according  to  the  current  <b>sort-mode</b>  on entry to a group.
              Otherwise, articles will be presented in order of arrival.  If not set on  entry  to  a  menu  for
              merged  groups,  the articles from each group will be kept together on the menu.  If <b>sort</b> is unset
              while merged groups are presented on the menu, the articles will be  reordered  by  local  article
              number (which may not keep articles from the same group together).

       <b>sort-mode</b> <u>mode</u> (integer, default 1)
              The  default  sort  algorithm used to sort the articles on entry to a news group.  It is a numeric
              value corresponding to one of the sorting methods described in connection with the :sort command:
                   0 - arrival (ordered by article number)
                   1 - subject (subjects ordered after age of first article)
                   2 - lexical (subjects in lexicographical order)
                   3 - age (articles ordered after posting date only)
                   4 - sender (articles ordered after sender's name)

       <b>spell-checker</b> <u>shell-command</u>   (string, default not set)
              When set, responses can be checked for spelling mistakes via the (i)spell action.  The command  to
              perform  the  spelling  is given the file containing the full article including header as its only
              argument.  If the spell checker can fix spelling mistakes, it must apply the changes  directly  to
              this file.

       <b>split</b>          (boolean, default true)
              When  set,  digests  will  automatically  and  silently  be split into sub-articles which are then
              handled transparently as normal articles.  Otherwise, digests are presented as one article  (which
              you can split on demand with the <b>G</b> command).

       <b>stop</b> <u>lines</u>     (integer, default not set)
              When  <b>stop</b> is set, <u>nn</u> will only show the first <u>lines</u> lines of the of each article before prompting
              you to continue.  This is useful on slow terminals and modem lines to be able to see the first few
              lines of longer articles (and skipping the rest with the <b>n</b> command).

       <b>subject-match-limit</b> <u>length</u>    (integer, default 256)
              Subjects will be considered identical if  their  first  <u>length</u>  characters  match.   Setting  this
              uncritically to a low value may cause unexpected results!

       <b>subject-match-offset</b> <u>offset</u>   (integer, default 0)
              When  set  to  a  positive  number,  that  many characters at the beginning of the subject will be
              ignored when comparing subjects for ordering and equality purposes.

       <b>subject-match-parts</b> (boolean, default false)
              When set, two subjects will be considered equal if they are identical up to the first  (differing)
              digit.   Together  with the <b>subject-match-offset</b> variable, this can be used in source groups where
              the subject often has a format like:
                   vXXXXXX: Name of the package (Part 01/04)
              Setting <b>subject-match-offset</b> to 8 and <b>subject-match-parts</b> to true will make <u>nn</u> consider  all  four
              parts of the package having the same subject (and thus be selectable with `*').
              Notice  that  changing the <b>subject-match-</b>... variables manually will not have an immediate effect.
              To reorder the menu, an explicit <b>:sort</b> command must be  performed.   These  variables  are  mainly
              intended to be set using the <b>:local</b> command in <b>on</b> <b>entry</b> macros for source and binary groups (entry
              macros are evaluated before the menu is collected and sorted).

       <b>subject-match-minimum</b> <u>characters</u>   (integer, default 4)
              When  set  to  a  positive number, that many characters at the beginning of the subject must match
              before the subject-match-parts option comes into affect.  This  is  important,  because  the  part
              matching causes the rest of the line to be ignored after the first digit pair is discovered.  This
              begins after any subject-match-offset has been applied.

       <b>suggest-default-save</b>     (boolean, default true)
              When  set,  <u>nn</u>  will  present the <b>default-save-file</b> when prompting for a save file name in a group
              without a specific save file, or <b>folder-save-file</b> when saving from a folder.   When  not  set,  no
              file name is presented, and to use the default save file, a single + must be specified.

       <b>tidy-newsrc</b>         (boolean, default false)
              When  set, <u>nn</u> will automatically remove lines from .newsrc which represent groups not found in the
              active file or unsubscribed groups if <b>keep-unsubscribed</b> is not set.

       <b>time</b>      (boolean, default true)
              When set, <u>nn</u> will show the current time in the prompt line.  This is useful on systems  without  a
              <u>sysline</u> <u>(1)</u> utility.

       <b>trace-folder-packing</b>     (boolean, default true)
              When set, a trace of the retained and deleted messages is printed when a folder is rewritten.

       <b>trusted-escape-codes</b> <u>codes</u>    (string, default none)
              When  set  to  a  list of one or more characters, <u>nn</u> will trust and output <u>escape</u> characters in an
              article if it is followed by one of the characters in the list.  For example, to switch to or from
              kanji mode, control codes like "<u>esc</u> $" and "<u>esc</u> ( J" may be present in the text.  To  allow  these
              codes, use the following command:
                   set trusted-escape-codes ($
              You  can also set it to <b>all</b> to pass all escape codes through to the screen.  Notice that <u>nn</u> thinks
              all characters (including <u>esc</u>) output to the screen as occupy one column.

       <b>unshar-command</b> <u>shell-command</u>  (string, default "<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>")
              This is the command which is invoked by the <b>unshar</b> command.

       <b>unshar-header-file</b> <u>file</u>  (string, default "Unshar.Headers")
              The name of the file in which the header and initial text of articles unpacked  with  the  <b>:unshar</b>
              command  is  saved.   Unless the file name starts with a `/', the file will be created in the same
              directory as the unpacked files.  The information is not  saved  if  this  variable  is  not  set.
              Setting it to "Unshar.Result" will cause the headers and the results from the unpacking process to
              be merged in a meaningful way (unless <b>mmdf-format</b> is set).

       <b>unsubscribe-mark-read</b>    (boolean, default true)
              When  set,  unsubscribing  to  a  group will automatically mark all current articles read; this is
              recommended to keep the size of .newsrc down.   Otherwise,  unread  articles  in  the  unsubscribe
              groups are kept in .newsrc.  If <b>keep-unsubscribed</b> is false, this variable has no effect.

       <b>update-frequency</b>         (integer, default 1)
              Specifies  how many changes need to be done to the .newsrc or select files before they are written
              back to disk.  The default setting causes .newsrc to be updated every time a group has been read.

       <b>use-editor-line</b>          (boolean, default true)
              Most editors accept arguments of the form:
                   editor [-arguments] +n filename
              where editor is the name of the editor, and n is the line number to put the cursor  upon  entering
              the file.  If use-editor-line is false, it will not add the "+n" to the arguments.

       <b>use-path-in-from</b>         (boolean, default false)
              When <b>mail-format</b> is set, saved articles will be preceded by a specially formatted "From " line:
                   From origin date
              Normally,  the  origin  will be the name of the news group where the article appeared, but if <b>use-</b>
              <b>path-in-from</b> is set, the contents of the "Path:" header will be used as the origin.

       <b>use-selections</b>      (boolean, default true)
              When set, <u>nn</u> uses the selections and other article attributes saved last time <u>nn</u> was used.  If not
              set, <u>nn</u> ignores the select file.

       <b>visible-bell</b>   (boolean, default true)
              When set, <u>nn</u> will flash the screen instead of "ringing the  bell"  if  the  visible  bell  (flash)
              capability is defined in the termcap/terminfo database.

       <b>window</b> <u>size</u>    (integer, default not set)
              When  set,  <u>nn</u>  will  reserve the last <u>size</u> lines of the menu screen for a preview window.  If not
              set, <u>nn</u> will clear the screen to preview an article if there are less than <b>min-window</b> lines at the
              bottom of the screen.  As a side effect, it can also be used to reduce  the  size  of  the  menus,
              which may be useful on slow terminals.

       <b>word-key</b> <u>key</u>   (key, default ^W)
              The  key which erases the last input component or word when <u>nn</u> is prompting for a string, e.g. the
              last name in a path name.

       <b>wrap-header-margin</b> <u>size</u>  (integer, default 6)
              When set (non-negative), the customized header fields specified  in  <b>header-lines</b>  will  be  split
              across several lines if they don't fit on one line.  When <u>size</u> is greater than zero, lines will be
              split  at  the  first  space  occurring  in  the  last  <u>size</u>  columns of the line.  If not set (or
              negative), long header lines will be truncated if they don't fit on a single line.

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOMIZED</b> <b>ARTICLE</b> <b>HEADER</b> <b>PRESENTATION</b></h4><pre>
       Normally, <u>nn</u> will just print a (high-lighted) single line header containing the author, subject, and date
       (optional) of the article when it is read.

       By setting the <b>header-lines</b> variable as described below, it is possible to get a more  informative  multi
       line header with optional high-lighting and underlining.

       The  <b>header-lines</b>  variable  is set to a list of header line identifiers, and the customized headers will
       then contain exactly these header lines <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>specified</u> <u>order</u>.

       The same specifications are also used by the <b>:print</b> and <b>save-short</b> commands  via  the  <b>print-header-lines</b>
       and <b>save-header-lines</b> variables.

       The  following  header line identifiers are recognized in the <b>header-lines</b>, <b>print-header-lines</b>, and <b>save-</b>
       <b>header-lines</b> variables:

               <b>A</b>    Approved:
               <b>a</b>    Spool-File:(path of spool file containing the article)
               <b>B</b>    Distribution:
               <b>C</b>    Control:
               <b>D</b>    Date:
               <b>d</b>    Date-Received:
               <b>F</b>    From:
               <b>f</b>    Sender:
               <b>G</b>    Newsgroup:(current group)
               <b>g</b>    Newsgroup:(current group if cross-posted or merged)
               <b>I</b>    Message-Id:
               <b>K</b>    Keywords:
               <b>L</b>    Lines:
               <b>N</b>    Newsgroups:
               <b>n</b>    Newsgroups:   (but only if cross posted)
               <b>O</b>    Organization:
               <b>P</b>    Path:
               <b>R</b>    Reply-To:
               <b>S</b>    Subject:
               <b>v</b>    Save-File:(the default save file for this article)
               <b>W</b>    Followup-To:
               <b>X</b>    References:
               <b>x</b>    Back-References:
               <b>Y</b>    Summary:

       The 'G' and 'g' fields will include the local article number if it is known, e.g.
            Newsgroup: news.software.nn/754

       The following special symbols are recognized in the <b>header-lines</b> variable (and ignored otherwise):

       Preceding the identifier with an equal sign "=" or an underscore "_" will cause the header field contents
       to be high-lighted or underlined.

       A plus sign "+" will use the shading attribute defined by <b>shading-on</b> and <b>shading-off</b>  to  high-light  the
       field contents.  If no shading attribute is defined it will underline the field instead.

       Including an asterisk "*" in the list will produce the standard one line header at that point.

       Example:   The  following  setting  of  the  <b>header-lines</b>  variable  will  show  the author (underlined),
       organization, posting date, and subject (high-lighted) when articles are read:
            set header-lines _FOD=S

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Some of the command line options have already been described, but below we provide a complete list of the
       effect of each option by showing the equivalent <b>set</b>, <b>unset</b>, or <b>toggle</b> command.

       Besides the options described below, you can set <u>any</u> of <u>nn</u>'s variables directly on the command  line  via
       an argument of the following format:
            variable=value
       To set or unset a boolean variable, the value can be specified as <u>on</u> or <u>off</u> (<u>t</u> and <u>f</u> will also work).

       Notice  that  the  init  files  are  read  <u>before</u>  the options are parsed (unless you use the -<b>I</b> option).
       Therefore, the options which are related to boolean variables set in the init file will toggle the  value
       set  there,  rather  than  the  default  value.   Consequently, the meaning of the options are also user-
       defined.

       The explanations below describe the effect related to the default setting  of  the  variables,  with  the
       `reverse' effect in square brackets.

       -<b>a</b><u>N</u>  {<b>set</b> <b>limit</b> <u>N</u>}
              <u>Limit</u>  the  maximum number of articles presented in each group to <u>N.</u>  This is useful to get up-to-
              date quickly if you have not read news for a longer period.

       -<b>a0</b>    Mark <u>all</u> unread articles as read.  See the full explanation at the beginning of this manual.

       -<b>B</b>   {<b>toggle</b> <b>backup</b>}
              Do not [do] backup the rc file.

       -<b>d</b>   {<b>toggle</b> <b>split</b>}
              Do not [do] split digests into separate articles.

       -<b>f</b>   {<b>toggle</b> <b>fsort</b>}
              Do not [do] sort folders according to the subject  (present  the  articles  in  a  folder  in  the
              sequence in which they were saved).

       -<b>g</b>     Prompt for the name of a news group or folder to be entered

       -<b>i</b>   {<b>toggle</b> <b>case-fold-search</b>}
              Normally  searches  with  -<b>n</b>  and  -<b>s</b>  are  case independent.  Using this option, the case becomes
              significant.

       -<b>I</b>     Do not read the init file.  This must be the first option!!  The global <u>setup</u> file is still read.

       -<b>I</b><u>file-list</u>
              Specifies an alternate list of init files to be loaded instead of the standard global and  private
              init files.  The list is a comma-separated list of file names.  Names which does not contain a `/'
              are  looked for in the <a href="file:~/.nn">~/.nn</a> directory.  An empty element in the list is interpreted as the global
              init file.  The list of init files must <u>not</u> be separated from the <b>-I</b> option by blanks, and it must
              be the first option.  Example:  The default behaviour corresponds  to  using  -I,init  (first  the
              global  file,  then  the  file <a href="file:~/.nn/init">~/.nn/init</a>).  The global <u>setup</u> file is still read as the first init
              file independently of the -I option used.

       -<b>k</b>   {<b>toggle</b> <b>kill</b>}
              Do not [do] perform automatic kill and selection of articles.

       -<b>l</b><u>N</u>  {<b>set</b> <b>stop</b> <u>N</u>}
              Stop after printing the first <u>N</u> lines of each article.  This is useful on slow terminals.

       -<b>L</b>[<u>f</u>]     {<b>set</b> <b>layout</b> <u>f</u>}
              Select alternative menu layout <u>f</u> (0 to 4).  If <u>f</u> is omitted, menu layout 3 is selected.

       -<b>m</b>   {<u>no</u> <u>corresponding</u> <u>variable</u>}
              Merge all articles into one `meta group' instead of showing them one group at a time.  When -m  is
              used, no articles will be marked as read.

       -<b>n</b><u>WORD</u> Collect  only  articles  which contain the string <u>WORD</u> in the sender's name (case is ignored).  If
              <u>WORD</u> starts with a slash `/', the rest of the argument is used as a <u>regular</u> <u>expression</u> instead  of
              a fixed string.

       -<b>N</b>   {<u>no</u> <u>corresponding</u> <u>variable</u>}
              Disable  updating  of  the  rc  file.   This  includes not recording that groups have been read or
              unsubscribed to (although <u>nn</u> will think so until you quit).

       -<b>q</b>   {<b>toggle</b> <b>sort</b>}
              Do not [do] sort the articles (q means quick, but it isn't any quicker in practice!)

       -<b>Q</b>   {<b>toggle</b> <b>silent</b>}
              Quiet mode - don't [do] print the logo or "No News" messages.

       -<b>r</b>   {<b>toggle</b> <b>repeat-group-query</b>}
              Make -<b>g</b> repeat query for a group to enter.

       -<b>s</b><u>WORD</u> Collect only articles which contain the string <u>WORD</u> in their subject (case is ignored).   If  <u>WORD</u>
              starts  with  a  slash  `/', the rest of the argument is used as a <u>regular</u> <u>expression</u> instead of a
              fixed string.

       -<b>S</b>   {<b>toggle</b> <b>repeat</b>}
              Do not [do] eliminate duplicated subject lines on menus.

       -<b>T</b>   {<b>toggle</b> <b>time</b>}
              Do not [do] show the current time in the prompt line.

       -<b>w</b>[<u>N</u>]     {<b>set</b> <b>window</b> <u>N</u>}
              Reserve <u>N</u> lines of the menu screen for a preview window.  If <u>N</u> is omitted, the preview  window  is
              set to 5 lines.

       -<b>W</b>   {<b>toggle</b> <b>confirm-messages</b>}
              [Don't] Wait for confirmation on all messages.

       -<b>x</b>[<u>N</u>]     {<b>set</b> <b>old</b> <b>N</b>}
              Present  (or  scan)  all  (or  the  last <u>N</u>) unread as well as read articles.  This will <u>never</u> mark
              unread articles as read.

       -<b>X</b>   {<u>no</u> <u>corresponding</u> <u>variable</u>}
              Read/scan unsubscribed groups also.  Most useful when  looking  for  a  specific  subject  in  all
              groups, e.g.
                 nn -mxX -sSubject all

</pre><h4><b>MACRO</b> <b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Practically any combination of commands and key strokes can be defined as a macro which can be bound to a
       single key in menu and/or reading mode.

       The  macro  definition must specify a sequence of commands and key strokes as if they were typed directly
       from the keyboard.  For example, a string specifying a file name must follow a save command.  This manual
       does not give a complete specification of  all  the  input  required  by  the  various  commands;  it  is
       recommended  to execute the desired command sequence from the keyboard prior to defining the macro to get
       the exact requirements of each command.

       Although it is possible to define  temporary  macros  interactively  using  the  <b>:define</b>  command,  macro
       definitions are normally placed in the <u>init</u> file.  Macros are numbered from 0 to 100, i.e. it is possible
       to  define  a  total  of 101 different macros (implicit macros defined with the <b>map</b> command uses internal
       numbers from 101 to 200).

       To define macro number <u>M</u>, the following construction is used (the line breaks are mandatory):
            <b>define</b> <u>M</u>
                 <u>body</u>
            <b>end</b>

       The <u>body</u> consists of a sequence of <u>tokens</u> separated  by  white  space  (blanks  or  newlines).   However,
       certain <u>tokens</u> continue to the end of the current line.

       The following <u>tokens</u> may occur in the macro <u>body</u>:

       <u>Comments</u>
              Empty lines and text following a # character (preceded by white space) is ignored.

       <u>Command</u> <u>Names</u>
              Any command name listed in the key mapping section can be included in a macro causing that command
              to be invoked when the macro is executed.

       <u>Extended</u> <u>Commands</u>
              All the extended commands which can be executed through the <b>command</b> command (normally bound to the
              : key) can also be executed in a macro.  An extended command starts with a colon (:) and continues
              to the end of the current line.  Example:

       <u>Key</u> <u>Strokes</u>
              A  key stroke (which is normally mapped into a command depending on the current mode) is specified
              as a key name enclosed in single quotes.  Examples (A-key, left arrow key, RETURN key):
                   'A'  'left'  '^M'

       <u>Shell</u> <u>Commands</u>
              External commands can be invoked as part of a macro execution.   There  are  two  forms  of  shell
              command  invocations  available  depending on whether a command <u>may</u> produce output or require user
              input, or it is <u>guaranteed</u> to complete without input or output to the terminal.  The difference is
              that in the latter case, <u>nn</u> does not prepare the terminal to be used by another program.  When the
              command completes, the screen is <u>not</u> redrawn automatically; you should use the <b>redraw</b>  command  to
              do that.  The tho forms are:
                   :!echo this command uses the terminal
                   :!!echo this command does not &gt; /tmp/file

       <u>Strings</u>
              Input  to  commands  prompting  for  a  string, e.g. a file name, can be specified in a macro as a
              double quoted string.  Example (save without prompting for a file name):
                   <b>save-short</b> "+$G"

       <u>Conditionals</u>
              Conditionals may occur anywhere in a macro; a conditional is evaluated when the macro is executed,
              and if the condition is false <u>the</u> <u>rest</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>current</u> <u>line</u> <u>is</u> <u>ignored</u>.  The following conditionals
              are available:
                   <b>?menu</b>     True in menu mode
                   <b>?show</b>     True in reading mode
                   <b>?folder</b>   True when looking at a folder
                   <b>?group</b>    True when looking at a news group
                   <b>?yes</b> Query user, true if answer is yes
                   <b>?no</b>  Query user, true if answer is no
              Example (stop macro execution if user rejects to continue):
                   <b>prompt</b> "continue? " <b>?no</b> <b>break</b>
              In addition to these conditionals, it is possible to test the current value of boolean and integer
              variables using the following form:
                   <b>?</b><u>variable</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>
              This conditional will be true (1) if the variable is an integer variable whose  current  value  is
              the  one  specified,  or  (2)  if  the  variable  is a boolean variable which is either <b>on</b> or <b>off</b>.
              Examples:
                   ?layout=3 :set layout 1
                   ?monitor=on  break
                   ?sort=off :sort age

       <b>break</b>  Terminate macro execution completely.  This includes nested macros.  Example (stop if looking at a
              folder):
                   <b>?folder</b> <b>break</b>

       <b>return</b> Terminate execution of current macro.   If  the  current  macro  is  called  from  another  macro,
              execution of that macro continues immediately.

       <b>input</b>  Query  the  user  for a key stroke or a string, for example a file name.  Example (prompt the user
              for a file name in the usual way):
                   <b>save-short</b> <b>input</b>

       <b>yes</b>    Confirm unconditionally <u>if</u> a command requires confirmation.  It is ignored if the command does not
              require confirmation.  Example (confirm creation of new files):
                   <b>save-short</b> "+$G" <b>yes</b>

       <b>no</b>     Terminate execution of current macro <u>if</u> a command requires confirmation; otherwise ignore it.   If
              neither  <b>yes</b>  nor  <b>no</b>  is specified when a command requires confirmation, the user must answer the
              question as usual - if the user confirms the action execution continues  normally;  otherwise  the
              execution of the current macro is terminated.  Example (do not create new files):
                   <b>save-short</b> "+$L/misc" <b>no</b>

       <b>prompt</b> <u>string</u>
              Print  the <u>string</u> in the prompt line (highlighted).  The string must be enclosed in double quotes.
              Example:
                   <b>prompt</b> "Enter recipient name"
              When the macro terminates, the original prompt shown on entry to the macro will  automatically  be
              redrawn.   If  this is not desirable (e.g.  if the macro goes from selection to reading mode), the
              redrawing of the prompt can be disabled by using a <b>prompt</b>  command  with  an  empty  <u>string</u>  ("").
              Example:
                   <b>prompt</b> "Enter reading mode?" # old prompt is saved
                   ?no return # and old prompt is restored
                   read-skip       # changes the prompt
                   <b>prompt</b> "" # so forget old prompt

       <b>echo</b> <u>string</u>
              Display the <u>string</u> in the prompt line for a short period.  Example:
                   ?show <b>echo</b> "Cannot be used in reading mode" break

       <b>puts</b> <u>string-to-end-of-line</u>
              The rest of the line is output directly to the terminal without interpretation.

       <b>macro</b> <u>M</u>
              Invoke macro number <u>M</u>.  The maximum macro nesting level is five (also catches macro loops).

       I  use  the  following  macro  to  quickly save all the selected files in a file whose name is entered as
       usual.  It also works in reading mode (saving just the current article).
            <b>define</b> 1
                 :unset save-report
                 save-short input yes
                 ?menu '+'
                 :set save-report
            <b>end</b>

</pre><h4><b>KEY</b> <b>MAPPINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The descriptions of the keys and commands provided in this manual reflects the default  key  mappings  in
       <u>nn</u>.   However,  you  can  easily  change  these  mappings  to match your personal demands, and it is also
       possible to remap keys depending on the terminal in use.   Permanent  remapping  of  keys  must  be  done
       through  the <u>init</u> file, while temporary changes (for the duration of the current invocation of <u>nn</u>) can be
       made with the <b>:map</b> command.

       The binding and mapping of keys are controlled by four tables:

       <b>The</b> <b>multikey</b> <b>definition</b> <b>table</b>
              This table is used for mapping multicharacter key sequences into single  characters.   By  default
              the  table  contains  the mappings for the four cursor keys, and there is room for 10 user-defined
              multikeys.  The fourteen multikeys are named: <b>up</b>, <b>down</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>left</b> (the four arrow keys), and  <b>#0</b>
              through <b>#9</b> for the user-defined keys.
              Multikey #<u>i</u> (where <u>i</u> is a digit or an arrow key name) is defined using the following command:
                   <b>map</b> <b>#</b><u>i</u> <u>key-sequence</u>
              where  the  <u>sequence</u>  is  a  list  of  7-bit character names (see below) separated by spaces.  For
              example, if the HOME key sends the sequence ESC [ H, you can define multikey #0 to be the home key
              using the command:
                   map #0 ^[ [ H

       <b>The</b> <b>input</b> <b>key</b> <b>mapping</b> <b>table</b>
              All characters that are read from the keyboard will be mapped through  the  input  mapping  table.
              Consequently,  you can globally remap one key to produce any other key value.  By default all keys
              are mapped into themselves.
              An entry in the input key mapping table to map <u>input-key</u> into <u>new-key</u> is made with the command
                   <b>map</b> <b>key</b> <u>input-key</u> <u>new-key</u>
              For example, to make your ESC key function as <b>interrupt</b> you can use the command
                   map key ^[ ^G

       <b>The</b> <b>selection</b> <b>mode</b> <b>key</b> <b>binding</b> <b>table</b>
              This table defines for each key which command should be  invoked  when  that  key  is  pressed  in
              selection  mode,  i.e.  when the article menu is shown.  The command to bind a <u>key</u> to a <u>command</u> in
              selection mode is:
                   <b>map</b> <b>menu</b> <u>key</u> <u>command</u>
              For example, to have the HOME key defined as multikey #0 above bound to the  <b>select</b>  command,  the
              following command is used:
                   map menu #0 select
              To  remap  a  key  to  select a specific article on the menu (which the `a' through `z' keys do by
              default), the <u>command</u> must be specified as `<b>article</b> <u>N</u>' where <u>N</u> is the entry  number  on  the  menu
              counted  from zero (i.e. a=0, b=1, ..., z=25, 0=26, ..., 9=35).  For example, to map `J' to select
              article `j', the following command is used:
                   map menu J article 9

       <b>The</b> <b>reading</b> <b>mode</b> <b>key</b> <b>binding</b> <b>table</b>
              This table defines for each key which command should be  invoked  when  that  key  is  pressed  in
              reading  mode,  i.e.  when  the  article text is shown.  The command to bind a <u>key</u> to a <u>command</u> in
              reading mode is:
                   <b>map</b> <b>show</b> <u>key</u> <u>command</u>

       In addition to the direct mappings described above, the following  variations  of  the  <b>map</b>  command  are
       available:

       <b>User</b> <b>defined</b> <b>keymaps</b>
              Additional keymaps can be defined using the command
                   <b>make</b> <b>map</b> <u>newmap</u>
              This will create a new keymap which can initialized using normal <b>map</b> commands, e.g.
                   <b>map</b> <u>newmap</u> <u>key</u> <u>command</u>
              To activate a user-defined keymap, it must be bound to a <u>prefix</u> <u>key</u>:
                   <b>map</b> <u>base-map</u> <u>prefix-key</u> <b>prefix</b> <u>newmap</u>
              When  used,  the prefix key itself does not activate a command, but instead it require another key
              to be entered and then execute the command bound to that key in the keymap which is bound  to  the
              prefix key.
                For example, to let the key sequence "^X i" execute macro number 10 in both modes, the following
              commands can be used:
                   make map ctl-x
                   map ctl-x i macro 10
                   map both ^X prefix ctl-x

       <b>Mapping</b> <b>keys</b> <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>modes</b>
              Using  the  pseudo-keymap  `both',  it is possible to map a key to a command in both selection and
              reading mode at once.  For example, to map the home key to macro  number  5  in  both  modes,  the
              following command can be used:
                   map both #0 macro 5

       <b>Aliasing</b>
              A  key can also be mapped directly to the command currently bound to another key.  Later remapping
              of the other key will not change the mapping of  the  `aliased'  key.   This  is  done  using  the
              following command:
                   map <u>keymap</u> <u>new-key</u> <b>as</b> <u>old-key</u>

       <b>Binding</b> <b>macros</b> <b>to</b> <b>keys</b>
              A previously defined macro can be bound to a key using the command:
                   map <u>keymap</u> <u>key</u> <b>macro</b> <u>macro-number</u>

       <b>Implicit</b> <b>macro</b> <b>definitions</b>
              An implicit macro can also be defined directly in connection with the <b>map</b> command:
                   map <u>keymap</u> <u>key</u> <b>(</b>
                   <u>body</u>...
                   <b>)</b>

       Keys and character names are specified using the following notation:

       <u>C</u>      A single printable character represents the key or character itself.

       <b>^</b><u>C</u>     This notation represents a control key or character.  DEL is written as <b>^?</b>

       <u>125</u>, <u>0175</u>, <u>0x7D</u>
              Characters  and  keys  can  be specified by their ordinal value in decimal, octal, and hexadecimal
              notation.

       <b>up</b>, <b>down</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>left</b>
              These names represent the cursor keys.

       <b>#0</b>  through  <b>#9</b>
              These symbols represent the ten user-defined multikeys.

       If the variable <b>data-bits</b> is 7, key maps can specify binding of all keys in the range 0x00 to  0x7F,  and
       the  8th  bit will be stripped in all keyboard input.  If the variable <b>data-bits</b> is 8, the 8th bit is not
       cleared, and key maps are extended to allow binding of keys in the range 0xA0 to 0xFE  (corresponding  to
       the  national  characters defined by the ISO 8859 character sets).  Binding commands to these keys can be
       done either by using their numeric value, or directly specifying the 8 bit character in the map  command,
       e.g.
            map menu 0xC8 macro 72

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Below is a list of all the commands that can be bound to keys, either in selection mode, in reading mode,
       or both.  For each command the default command key bindings in both modes are shown.  If the key  is  not
       bound  in  one  of  the  modes,  but  it can be bound, the corresponding part will just be empty.  If the
       command cannot be bound in one of the modes, that mode will contain the word <b>nix</b>.

       See the descriptions of the default bindings for a description of the commands.  The pseudo  command  <b>nil</b>
       is used to <u>unbind</u> a key.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>INIT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>init</u> files are used to customize <u>nn</u>'s behaviour to local conventions and restrictions and to satisfy
       each user's personal taste.
       Normally, <u>nn</u> reads up to three init files on start-up if they exist (all init files are optional):

       $LIB/<b>setup</b>
              A system-wide file located in the library directory.  This file is <u>always</u> loaded before any  other
              init  file  (even  when  the  -<b>I</b>  option  is  specified).   It cannot contain a group presentation
              sequence.

       $LIB/<b>init</b>
              Another system-wide (global) init file located in the library directory.  This file may be ignored
              via the -<b>I</b> option.

       <a href="file:~/.nn/">~/.nn/</a><b>init</b>
              The private init file located in the user's <u>.nn</u> directory.  It is read after the global init  file
              to allow the user to change the default setup.

       The  init  file  is  parsed  one  line  at a time.  If a line ends with a backslash `\', the backslash is
       ignored, and the following line is appended to the current line.

       The init file may contain the following types of commands (and data):

       <b>Comments</b>
              Empty lines and lines with a # character as the first non-blank  character  are  ignored.   Except
              where # has another meaning defined by the command syntax (e.g. multi-keys are named #<u>n</u>), trailing
              comments on input lines are ignored.

       <b>Variable</b> <b>settings</b>
              You  can  <b>set</b> (or <b>unset</b>) all the variables described earlier to change nn's behaviour permanently.
              The <b>set</b> and <b>unset</b> commands you can use in the init file have exactly the same format as  the  <b>:set</b>
              and <b>:unset</b> commands described earlier (except that the : prefix is omitted.)
              Variables  can  also  be  locked via the <b>lock</b> command; this is typically done in the <u>setup</u> file to
              enforce local policies.

       <b>Key</b> <b>mappings</b>
              You can use all the versions of the <b>map</b> command in the init file.

       <b>Macro</b> <b>Definitions</b>
              You can define sequences of commands and key strokes using the  <b>define</b>...<b>end</b>  construction,  which
              can then be bound to single keys with the <b>map</b> command.

       <b>Load</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>specific</b> <b>files</b>
              You can load a terminal specific file using the
                   <b>load</b> <u>file</u>
              The  character <b>@</b> in the <u>file</u> will be replaced by the terminal type defined in the TERM environment
              variable.  <u>nn</u> silently ignores the <b>load</b> command if the file does not exist (so you don't  have  to
              have  a  specific  init  file for terminals which does not require remapping).  If the file is not
              specified by an absolute pathname, it must reside in your <a href="file:~/.nn">~/.nn</a> directory.  Examples:
                   # load local customizations
                   load /usr/lib/nninit
                   # load personal terminal specific customizations
                   load init.@

       <b>Switch</b> <b>to</b> <b>loading</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>init</b> <b>file</b>
              You can skip the rest of the current init file and start loading a different init  file  with  the
              following command:
                   <b>chain</b> <u>file</u>
              If  this  occur  in  the private or global init file, the chained init file may contain a sequence
              part which will replace the private or global presentation sequence respectively.

       <b>Stop</b> <b>loading</b> <b>current</b> <b>init</b> <b>file</b>
              You can skip the rest of the current init file with the following command:
                   <b>stop</b>

       <b>Give</b> <b>error</b> <b>messages</b> <b>and/or</b> <b>terminate</b>
              If an error is detected in the init file, the following commands can be used  to  print  an  error
              message and/or terminate execution:
              <b>error</b> <u>fatal</u> <u>error</u> <u>message</u>...
                   Print the message and terminate execution.
              <b>echo</b> <u>warning</u> <u>message</u>...
                   Print the message and continue.
              <b>exit</b> [ <u>status</u> ]
                   Terminate <u>nn</u> with the specified exit status or 0 if omitted.

       <b>Change</b> <b>working</b> <b>directory</b> <b>of</b> <b>nn</b>
              You can use the <b>cd</b> command to change the working directory whenever you enter <u>nn</u>.  Example:
                   # Use folder directory as working directory inside <u>nn</u>
                   cd <a href="file:~/News">~/News</a>

       <b>Command</b> <b>groups</b>
              The  init  file  can  contain groups of commands which are executed under special conditions.  The
              command groups are described in the section on command groups below.

       <b>One</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>save-files</b> <b>sections</b>
              A <b>save-files</b> section is used to assign default save files to specific groups:
                   <b>save-files</b>
                     <u>group-name</u> <u>(pattern)</u> <u>file-name</u>
                     ...
                   <b>end</b>
              The group name (patterns) and save file names are specified in the same way as in the presentation
              sequence (see below).  Example:
                   <b>save-files</b>
                     news*  +news/$L
                     comp.sources*  /u/src/$L/
                   <b>end</b>

       <b>The</b> <b>news</b> <b>group</b> <b>presentation</b> <b>sequence</b>
              The <u>last</u> part of the init file may specify the sequence in which you want the news  groups  to  be
              presented.  This part starts with the command <b>sequence</b> and continues to the end of the init file.

       Both  init  files  may contain a presentation sequence.  In this case, the global sequence is <u>appended</u> to
       the private sequence.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>GROUPS</b></h4><pre>
       Command groups may only occur in the init file, and they  provide  a  way  to  have  series  of  commands
       executed at certain points during news reading.

       In  release  6.4  onwards, these possibilities are still rather rudimentary, and a mixture of normal init
       file syntax and macro syntax is used depending on whether the command group is only executed on  start-up
       or several times during the <u>nn</u> session.

       A  command  group  begins  with the word <b>on</b> and ends with the word <b>end</b>.  The following command groups are
       conditionally executed during the parsing of the init file if the specified <u>condition</u> is true.  They  may
       also have an optional <b>else</b> part which is executed if the <u>condition</u> is false:
            <b>on</b> <u>condition</u>
                 commands
            [ <b>else</b>
                 commands ]
            <b>end</b>

       The following conditional command groups may be used in the init file to be executed at start-up:

       <b>on</b> <b>[</b> <u>test</u> <b>]</b>
              The  commands  (init file syntax) in the group are executed only if the specified <u>test</u> is true.  A
              shell is spawned to execute the command "[ <u>test</u> ]", so all the options of the <b><a href="../man1/test.1.html">test</a></b>(1)  command  is
              available.   For  example,  to  unset  the  flow-control  variable if the tty is a pseudo-tty, the
              following conditional can be used:
                   on [ -n "`tty | grep ttyp`" ]
                        unset flow-control
                   end

       <b>on</b> <b>!</b><u>shell</u> <u>command</u>
              The command group is executed if the given <u>shell</u> <u>command</u> exits  with  0  status  (success).   Care
              should  be  taken  that the command does not produce any output, e.g. by redirecting its output to
              /dev/null.  For example, to prevent people from reading news if load is above  a  specific  level,
              the following conditional might be placed in the global setup file.
                   on !load-above 5
                        error load is too high, try again later.
                   end

       <b>on</b> <b>`</b><u>shell</u> <u>command</u><b>`</b> <u>string</u>...
              The  command group is executed if the <u>first</u> <u>output</u> <u>line</u> from executing the specified <u>shell</u> <u>command</u>
              is listed among the specified <u>string</u> values.  The <u>shell</u>  <u>command</u>  can  be  omitted  on  subsequent
              occurrences  of  this  conditional,  in which case the output from the last <b>shell</b> <b>command</b> is used.
              For example, the following conditional can be used to switch to an init file which has  a  limited
              sequence for news reading during working hours, evenings, and nights:
                   on `date +%H` 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
                        chain init.work
                   end
                   on `` 17 18 19 20 21
                        chain init.evening
                   else
                        chain init.night
                   end

       <b>on</b> <b>``</b> <u>string</u>...
              This  is  equivalent  to  the  previous form except that instead of executing a shell command, the
              output from the previous

       <b>on</b> <b>$</b><u>variable</u> [ <u>value</u> ]
              If no <u>value</u> strings are specified, the command group is executed if the given <u>variable</u> is  defined
              in  the  environment.   Otherwise, the command group is executed only if the value of the <u>variable</u>
              occur in the <u>value</u> list.  For example, if you want <u>nn</u> to look for mail in whatever $MAIL is set to
              - if it is set - you can use the following code:
                   on $MAIL
                        set mail $(MAIL)
                   end

       <b>on</b> <b>slow</b>
              The commands (init file syntax) in the group are executed only  if  the  current  terminal  output
              speed  is less than or equal to the baud rate set in the <b>slow-speed</b> variable.  This can be used to
              optimize the user-interface for slow terminals by setting suitable variables:
                   <b>on</b> <b>slow</b>
                        set confirm-entry
                        set slow-mode
                        set delay-redraw
                        unset visible-bell
                        set compress
                        unset header-lines
                        set stop 5
                        set window 10
                   <b>end</b>

       <b>on</b> <b>fast</b>
              Same as <b>on</b> <b>slow</b> except that the commands are only executed when the terminal is running at a speed
              above the <b>slow-speed</b> value.

       <b>on</b> <b>term</b> <u>term-type</u>...
              The commands are executed if one of the  <u>term-type</u>  names  is  identical  to  value  of  the  TERM
              environment variable.

       <b>on</b> <b>host</b> <u>host-name</u>...
              The commands are executed if the local host's name occur in the <u>host-name</u> list.

       <b>on</b> <b>program</b> <u>program-name</u>...
              The commands are executed if the current program (<u>nn</u>, <u>nncheck</u>, etc) in the <u>program-name</u> list.

       The  following  <b>on</b>  command groups are really macros which may be executed during <u>nn</u>'s normal processing,
       and as such they cannot have an <b>else</b> part.

       <b>on</b> <b>entry</b> [ <u>group</u> <u>list</u> ]
              These commands (macro format!) are executed every time <u>nn</u> enters a news group.  If a group list is
              not specified, the commands are associated with all groups which don't have its  own  entry  macro
              specified in the group sequence.  Otherwise, the entry macro will be associated with the groups in
              the  list.   The  group  list  is specified using the meta-notations described in the presentation
              sequence section.
              <u>All</u> `:' commands at the beginning of the  command  group  are  executed  <u>before</u>  <u>nn</u>  collects  the
              articles  in the group, so it is possible to set or unset variables like <b>cross-post</b> and <b>auto-read-</b>
              <b>mode-limit</b> before any articles are collected and the menu is (not) shown.
                The non-`:' commands, and `:' commands that follows a command of another type will  be  executed
              immediately  <u>after</u>  the  first  menu  page  is  presented.   The execution of a `:' command can be
              postponed by using a double `::' as the command prefix.
                   <b>on</b> <b>entry</b> comp.sources* alt.sources
                        :set cross-post on   # set before collection
                        :local auto-read-mode-limit -1   # set before showing menu
                        ::unset cross-post   # set after collection
                   <b>end</b>

       <b>on</b> <b>start-up</b>
              These `:' commands (macro format!) are executed on start-up just before <u>nn</u> enters the  first  news
              group.   However,  postponed commands (i.e. non-`:' commands) will not be executed until the first
              group is shown (it works like an entry macro).

</pre><h4><b>GROUP</b> <b>PRESENTATION</b> <b>SEQUENCE</b></h4><pre>
       News groups are normally presented in the sequence defined in the system-wide <b>init</b> file in  <u>nn</u>'s  library
       directory.

       You  can  personalize the presentation sequence by specifying an alternative sequence in the private <u>init</u>
       file.  The sequence in the private init file is used <u>before</u> the global presentation  sequence,  and  need
       only describe the deviations from the default presentation sequence.

       The presentation sequence must start with the word
            <b>sequence</b>
       followed  by  a list of the news group names in the order you want them to be presented.  The group names
       must be separated by white space.  The sequence list must be the <u>last</u> part of the init file (the  parsing
       of commands from the init file stops when the word <b>sequence</b> is encountered).

       You  may  use a full group name like "comp.unix.questions", or just the name of a main group or subgroup,
       e.g. "comp" or "comp.unix".  However, if "comp" precedes "comp.unix.questions" in the list, this subgroup
       will be placed in the normal alphabetic sequence during the collection of all the "comp" groups.

       Groups which are not explicitly mentioned in any of the sequence files will be placed after the mentioned
       groups, unless `!!' is used and it has not been disabled (as described below).

       Each group name may be followed by a file or folder name (must start with either of `/' `~' or `+') which
       will specify the default save file for that group (and its subgroups).  A single `+' following the  group
       name  is  an abbreviation for the last save file name used.  For example, the following two sequences are
       equivalent:
            group1 +file group2 +file group3 +file
            group1 +file group2 + group3 +

       When an article is saved, the default save name will be used as the initial contents  of  the  file  name
       prompt for further editing.  It therefore does not need to be be a complete file name (unless you use the
       quick save mode).

       Each  group  name  may  also be associated with a so-called <b>entry</b> <b>action</b>.  This is basically an (unnamed)
       macro which is invoked on entry to the group (following the same rules as the `on  entry'  command  group
       related to :set and :unset commands).

       The entry action begins with a left parenthesis `<b>(</b>' and ends with a right parenthesis `<b>)</b>' on an otherwise
       empty line:
            comp.sources. +src/$L/ (
                 :set cross-post
            )
       The last entry action can be repeated by specifying an empty set of parenthesis, e.g.
            comp.unix. +unix ()
       The  entry  action  of  a  preceding group in the sequence can be associated with the current group(s) by
       specifying the name of the group in the parentheses instead of the commands, e.g.
            comp.unix. +unix (comp.sources.unix)
       A macro can also be associated with the entry action by specifying its number in  the  same  way  as  the
       group name above, e.g.
            rec.music. +music (30)
       Notice that it is the <u>current</u> definition of the macro which is associated with the group, so if the macro
       is later redefined with the `:define' command, it will not have any effect on the entry action.

       Group names can be specified using the following notations:

       group.name
              Append  the  group  (if  it  exists)  to the presentation sequence list.  If <b>also-subgroups</b> is set
              (default), all subscribed subgroups of the group will be included as  well  (if  there  are  any).
              Examples: "comp", "comp.unix", "comp.unix.questions".  If the group does not exits (e.g.  "comp"),
              the  subgroups  will be included even when <b>also-subgroups</b> is not set, i.e. "comp" is equivalent to
              "comp.".

       group.name.
              Append the subgroups of the specified group to the presentation sequence.  The group itself (if it
              exists) is not included.  Examples: "comp.", "comp.unix.".

       .group.name
              Append the groups whose name ends with the specified name to the sequence.  Example: ".test".

       group.name*
              Append the group and its subgroups to the presentation sequence list (even when <b>also-subgroups</b>  is
              not set).  Example: "comp.unix*".

       The following meta notation can be used in a sequence file.  The group.name can be specified using any of
       the forms described above:

       ! groups
              Completely  ignore  the  group  or  groups  specified  unless they are already in the presentation
              sequence (i.e. has been explicitly mentioned earlier in the sequence).

       !:<u>code</u> groups
              Ignore a selection of groups based on the given <u>code</u> letter (see below), unless they  are  already
              included  in  the  sequence.   Notice  that these forms <u>only</u> excludes groups from the presentation
              sequence, i.e. they <u>do</u> <u>not</u> include  the  remaining  groups  at  this  point;  that  must  be  done
              explicitly elsewhere.

       !:U groups
              Ignore  unsubscribed  groups, i.e. if they are neither new, nor present and subscribed in .newsrc.
              This is useful to ignore a whole hierarchy except for a few groups which are explicitly  mentioned
              in .newsrc and still see new groups as they are created.

       !:X groups
              Ignore  unsubscribed  <u>and</u>  new  groups,  i.e.  if they are not currently present and subscribed in
              .newsrc.  This is useful to ignore a whole hierarchy except for a few groups which are  explicitly
              mentioned  in .newsrc.  New groups in the hierarchy are ignored unless `NEW' occurs earlier in the
              sequence.

       !:O groups
              Ignore old groups, i.e. <u>unless</u> they are new.  This is useful to ignore a whole hierarchy but still
              see new groups which are created  in  the  hierarchy  (it  might  become  interesting  some  day).
              Individual  groups  can  still  be included in the sequence if they are specified before the `!:O'
              entry.

       !:N groups
              Ignore new groups in the hierarchy.

       !!     Stop building the presentation sequence.  This eliminates all groups that are not already  in  the
              presentation sequence.

       <b>NEW</b>    This  is  a  pseudo  group name which matches all <u>new</u> groups; you could place this symbol early in
              your presentation sequence to see new groups `out of  sequence'  (to  attract  your  attention  to
              them).

       <b>RC</b>     This is a pseudo group name which matches all groups occurring in the .newsrc file.  It will cause
              the  groups  in  .newsrc to be appended to the presentation sequence in the sequence in which they
              are listed in .newsrc.

       <b>RC:</b><u>number</u>
              Similar to the <b>RC</b> entry, but limited to the first <u>number</u> lines  of  the  .newsrc  file.   Example:
              RC:10 (use 10 lines of .newsrc).

       <b>RC:</b><u>string</u>
              Similar  to  the  <b>RC</b>  entry,  but  limited to the lines up to (and including) the first line (i.e.
              group) starting with the given <u>string</u>.  For example:  RC:alt.sources

       &lt; group.name
              Place the group (and its subgroups) at the beginning of the presentation  sequence.   Notice  that
              each  `&lt;' entry will place the group(s) at the beginning of the current sequence, i.e. &lt; A &lt; B &lt; C
              will generate the sequence C B A.

       &gt; group.name
              Place the group (and its subgroups) after all other groups that are and will be entered  into  the
              presentation sequence.

       @      Disable  the  `!!'  command.   This  can  be included in the personal presentation sequence if the
              global <b>sequence</b> file contains a !! entry (see example 1 below).

       % .... %
              Starts and ends a region of the sequence where it is possible to include  groups  which  has  been
              eliminated  earlier.   This  may  be  useful  to  alter the sequence of some groups, e.g. to place
              comp.sources.bugs after all other source groups, the following sequence can be used:
              ! comp.sources.bugs comp.sources* % comp.sources.bugs %

       <b>Example</b> <b>1:</b> In a company where ordinary users only should read the local news groups, and ignore the  rest
       (including  new  news  groups  which are otherwise always subscribed to initially), can use the following
       global presentation sequence:
            general
            follow
            ! local.test
            local
            !!
       The "expert" users in the company must put the <b>@</b> command somewhere in their  private  sequence  to  avoid
       losing news groups which they have not explicitly mentioned in their init file.

       <b>Example</b>  <b>2:</b> This is the global sequence for systems with heavy news addicts who setup their own sequences
       anyway.
            # all must read the general news first
            &lt; general
            # test is test, and junk is junk,
            # so it is placed at the very end
            &gt; test
            &gt; .test
            &gt; junk
            # this is the standard sequence which everybody may
            # change to their own liking
            local     # our local groups
            dk   # the Danish groups
            eunet.general # to present it before eunet.followup
            eunet     # the other European groups
            comp # the serious groups
            news # news on news
            sci  # other serious groups
            rec  # not really that important (don't quote me)
            misc # well, it must be somewhere
            # the groups that are not listed above goes here
       Notice the use of comments in the sequence where they are allowed at the end of non-empty lines as well.

       <b>Example</b> <b>3:</b> My own presentation sequence (in the init file) simply  lists  my  favourite  groups  and  the
       corresponding default save files:
          <b>sequence</b>
            !:U alt*  # ignore unsubscribed alt groups
            news.software.nn +nn
            comp.sys.ti* +ti/$L
            NEW  # show new groups here
            news*
            rec.music.synth +synth/
            comp.emacs*,gnu.emacs +emacs/misc
            comp.risks +risks
            eunet.sources +src/unix/
            comp.sources* +src/$L/
       The  presentation sequence is not used when <u>nn</u> is called with one or more news group names on the command
       line; it is thus possible to read ignored groups (on explicit request) without changing  the  init  file.
       (Of course, you can also use the <b>G</b> command to read ignored groups).

</pre><h4><b>MERGING</b> <b>NEWS</b> <b>GROUPS</b></h4><pre>
       The third example above contains the following line:
            comp.emacs*,gnu.emacs +emacs/misc
       This  is  the syntax used to <u>merge</u> groups.  When two or more groups are merged, all new articles in these
       groups are presented together as if they were one group.  To merge groups, their  names  must  be  listed
       together  in  the  sequence,  and only separated by a single comma.  To merge the groups resulting from a
       single group pattern (e.g. comp.emacs*), the group pattern must be followed by a comma and a blank  (e.g.
       comp.emacs*, ...).

       Merged  groups  are presented as the first group in the "list", and the word "MERGED" will be shown after
       the group name.  The <b>Y</b> {<b>overview</b>} command will still show merged groups as individual  groups,  but  they
       will be annotated with the symbol `&amp;' on the first of the groups, and a `+' on the rest of the groups.

       In the current version, the concept of the <u>current</u> <u>group</u> in connection with merged groups is a bit fuzzy.
       This should only be noticeable with the <b>G</b> command, which will take the most recently used group among the
       merged groups as the current group.  So things like <b>G</b> <b>=</b> <b>...</b> may not always work as expected.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables are used by <u>nn</u>:

       <b>EDITOR</b>.   The  editor  invoked  when editing replies, follow-ups, and composing mail.  <u>nn</u> knows about the
       following editors: <u>vi</u>, <u>ded</u>, <u>GNU</u> <u>emacs</u>, and <u>micro-emacs</u>, and will try to position the cursor on the  first
       line  following  the header, i.e. after the blank line which must not be deleted!  If an article has been
       included, the cursor is placed on the first line of the included text (to allow you  to  delete  sections
       easily).

       <b>LOGNAME</b>.   This  is taken as the login name of the current user.  It is used by <u>nn</u> to return failed mail.
       If it is not defined, <u>nn</u> will use the value of USER, or if that is not defined either, <u>nn</u>  will  use  the
       call  `who  am  i'  to get this information.  If all attempts fail, the failed mail is dropped in the bit
       bucket.

       <b>PAGER</b>.  This is used as the initial value of the <b>pager</b> variable.

       <b>SHELL</b>.  This is the shell which is spawned if the system cannot suspend  <u>nn</u>,  and  it  will  be  used  to
       execute the shell escapes.

       <b>TERM</b>.  The terminal type.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       When  <b>NNTP</b>  is being used over a slow link (as with the <u>ppp</u> protocol and a modem), it may be desirable to
       suppress the retrieval of the information about new newsgroups, and their  purpose,  since  they  can  be
       hundreds  of  KBytes in size.  To do this, the <b>new-group-action</b> and <b>show-purpose-mode</b> variables should be
       set to 0 in your <u>init</u> file.  See the descriptions of those variables for more info.

       Unfortunately, the list of active newsgroups is still fetched, since nn uses it to determine which groups
       to check for new articles.  Even this could be avoided, but the cost would be checking for  new  articles
       in every group, which might well be slower overall, although startup would be faster.
