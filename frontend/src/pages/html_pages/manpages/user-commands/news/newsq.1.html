</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       newsq - view the leafnode news queue

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>newsq</b> [<b>-f</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>newsq</b> outputs a summary of news that is in leafnode's out.going queue (or failed.postings directory, with
       <b>-f</b>).  The  out.going  queue  contains news that has been posted locally on your site and has not yet been
       uploaded to the upstream news server. The failed.postings directory contains news articles that have been
       rejected by upstream servers – these will not be retried automatically. You can hoewver move them to  the
       out.going  queue  manually – with the <b><a href="../man1/mv.1.html">mv</a></b>(1) command – to have fetchnews retry them the next time. This is
       useful if the posting failed because the upstream server had temporary difficulties.

       The queue is printed in the order it is read from the disk. The output is not  explicitly  sorted.  (This
       matches GNU "ls -U" behaviour.)

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f</b>     print  the  contents  of  the  failed.postings  directory instead. This option was introduced with
              leafnode v1.9.20.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
