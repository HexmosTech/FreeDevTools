       llogin - Connect to a LAT service

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>llogin</b> [options] service
       Options:
       [-dvcpblhQ] [-H node] [-R port] [-n name] [-w password | -W] [-q quit char]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       llogin  connects your terminal to a LAT service via latd, the service name must be known to latd for this
       to work.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-d</u>     Shows learned services. This is the same as latcp -d -l

       <u>-d</u> <u>-v</u>  Verbose form of -d. -v without -d is ignored.

       <u>-H</u> <u>&lt;node&gt;</u>
              Remote nodename. If the service is advertised by more than one node and you want to connect  to  a
              particular  node  then  use  this  switch.  By  default you will be connected to the node with the
              highest rating.

       <u>-R</u> <u>&lt;port&gt;</u>
              Connect to a specific port on (usually) a terminal server. This is the port NAME on the server and
              not the port number.

       <u>-c</u>     Do not convert typed LF to CR. By default the enter key generates LF and llogin converts it CR  as
              it  is  the  most generically useful translation.  This switch will cause the enter key to send LF
              instead. Occasionally useful for connecting to Unix consoles.

       <u>-b</u>     Convert typed DEL to BS. By default the DEL key (keyboard, top  right  usually)  send  DEL  (ASCII
              0x7f)  to  the  remote  system.  This  switch will cause the DEL key to send BS (ASCII 8) instead.
              Useful for some Unix systems connected via terminal servers.

       <u>-l</u>     Convert output LF to VT. By default LF output is sent as CRLF which can  cause  output  formatting
              problems.  Changing  this  to VT should preserve the output formatting on most devices or terminal
              emulators.

       <u>-q</u> <u>&lt;char&gt;</u>
              Change the quit character. By default CTRL-] will quit the terminal session. Entering a  character
              after  -q  will  cause CTRL-&lt;char&gt; to be the quit character for that session. -q0 will disable the
              quit character. If you use the latter, make sure  you  are  connecting  to  a  service  that  will
              disconnect you when you log out or you will have to kill llogin from another session to get out of
              it!

       <u>-Q</u>     Tells latd that the service you are connecting to is queued service and not a normal login service
              or port service. Unfortunately latd cannot tell whether a remote service needs to be queued or not
              so the onus is on the user to specify this switch when connecting to a queued service.

       <u>-n</u> <u>&lt;name&gt;</u>
              Sets  the  local connection name. By default this will be your local TTY name.  In most cases this
              simply affects the display of the terminal on the remote end so you shouldn't need to change it.

       <u>-w</u> <u>&lt;password&gt;</u>
              Sends the password for the service. Only needed for services that require a password  for  access.
              If  the  password given is "-" then you will be prompted for a password and it will not be echoed.
              This avoids having passwords visible on the screen.

       <u>-W</u>     Prompts for the service password. This is the same as -w- (see above).

       <u>-p</u>     Tells llogin to connect to the device named instead of a LAT service.  This  would  usually  be  a
              /dev/lat  pseudo-terminal but could be any other device you like really. This switch does not make
              the program useful as a terminal program because there is no way to set any serial parameters, nor
              am I going to add them. This is just a convenient way  to  use  the  /dev/lat  ports  without  the
              overhead of programs such as minicom.

       <u>-h</u>     Displays  a brief usage description. This is the same as invoking llogin without any parameters at
              all.
