</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       resolvectl, resolvconf - Resolve domain names, IPV4 and IPv6 addresses, DNS resource records, and
       services; introspect and reconfigure the DNS resolver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>resolvectl</b> [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND} [NAME...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>resolvectl</b> may be used to resolve domain names, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, DNS resource records and
       services with the <b><a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service</a></b>(8) resolver service. By default, the specified list of
       parameters will be resolved as hostnames, retrieving their IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. If the parameters
       specified are formatted as IPv4 or IPv6 addresses the reverse operation is done, and a hostname is
       retrieved for the specified addresses.

       The program's output contains information about the protocol used for the look-up and on which network
       interface the data was discovered. It also contains information on whether the information could be
       authenticated. All data for which local DNSSEC validation succeeds is considered authenticated. Moreover
       all data originating from local, trusted sources is also reported authenticated, including resolution of
       the local host name, the "localhost" hostname or all data from /etc/hosts.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>query</b> <u>HOSTNAME|ADDRESS</u>...
           Resolve domain names, as well as IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. When used in conjunction with <b>--type=</b> or
           <b>--class=</b> (see below), resolves low-level DNS resource records.

           If a single-label domain name is specified it is searched for according to the configured search
           domains — unless <b>--search=no</b> or <b>--type=</b>/<b>--class=</b> are specified, both of which turn this logic off.

           If an international domain name is specified, it is automatically translated according to IDNA rules
           when resolved via classic DNS — but not for look-ups via MulticastDNS or LLMNR. If <b>--type=</b>/<b>--class=</b>
           is used IDNA translation is turned off and domain names are processed as specified.

           If combined with <b>--json=</b> (only supported in combination with <b>--type=</b>) will output the resource record
           data in a JSON object.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>service</b> [[<u>NAME</u>] <u>TYPE</u>] <u>DOMAIN</u>
           Resolve <b>RFC</b> <b>6763</b> <b>DNS-SD</b>[1] and <b>RFC</b> <b>2782</b> <b>SRV</b>[2] services, depending on the specified list of
           parameters. If three parameters are passed the first is assumed to be the DNS-SD service name, the
           second the <b>SRV</b> service type, and the third the domain to search in. In this case a full DNS-SD style
           <b>SRV</b> and <b>TXT</b> lookup is executed. If only two parameters are specified, the first is assumed to be the
           <b>SRV</b> service type, and the second the domain to look in. In this case no <b>TXT</b> resource record is
           requested. Finally, if only one parameter is specified, it is assumed to be a domain name, that is
           already prefixed with an <b>SRV</b> type, and an <b>SRV</b> lookup is done (no <b>TXT</b>).

           Added in version 239.

       <b>openpgp</b> <u>EMAIL@DOMAIN</u>...
           Query PGP keys stored as <b>OPENPGPKEY</b> resource records, see <b>RFC</b> <b>7929</b>[3]. Specified e-mail addresses are
           converted to the corresponding DNS domain name, and any <b>OPENPGPKEY</b> keys are printed.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>tlsa</b> [<u>FAMILY</u>] <u>DOMAIN</u>[:<u>PORT</u>]...
           Query TLS public keys stored as <b>TLSA</b> resource records, see <b>RFC</b> <b>6698</b>[4]. A query will be performed for
           each of the specified names prefixed with the port and family ("_<u>port</u>._<u>family</u>.<u>domain</u>"). The port
           number may be specified after a colon (":"), otherwise <b>443</b> will be used by default. The family may be
           specified as the first argument, otherwise <b>tcp</b> will be used.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>status</b> [<u>LINK</u>...]
           Shows the global and per-link DNS settings currently in effect. If no command is specified, this is
           the implied default.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>statistics</b>
           Shows general resolver statistics, including information whether DNSSEC is enabled and available, as
           well as resolution and validation statistics.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>reset-statistics</b>
           Resets the statistics counters shown in <b>statistics</b> to zero. This operation requires root privileges.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>flush-caches</b>
           Flushes all DNS resource record caches the service maintains locally. This is mostly equivalent to
           sending the <b>SIGUSR2</b> to the <b>systemd-resolved</b> service.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>reset-server-features</b>
           Flushes all feature level information the resolver learnt about specific servers, and ensures that
           the server feature probing logic is started from the beginning with the next look-up request. This is
           mostly equivalent to sending the <b>SIGRTMIN+1</b> to the <b>systemd-resolved</b> service.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>dns</b> [<u>LINK</u> [<u>SERVER</u>...]], <b>domain</b> [<u>LINK</u> [<u>DOMAIN</u>...]], <b>default-route</b> [<u>LINK</u> [<u>BOOL</u>...]], <b>llmnr</b> [<u>LINK</u> [<u>MODE</u>]],
       <b>mdns</b> [<u>LINK</u> [<u>MODE</u>]], <b>dnssec</b> [<u>LINK</u> [<u>MODE</u>]], <b>dnsovertls</b> [<u>LINK</u> [<u>MODE</u>]], <b>nta</b> [<u>LINK</u> [<u>DOMAIN</u>...]]
           Get/set per-interface DNS configuration. These commands may be used to configure various DNS settings
           for network interfaces. These commands may be used to inform <b>systemd-resolved</b> or <b>systemd-networkd</b>
           about per-interface DNS configuration determined through external means. The <b>dns</b> command expects IPv4
           or IPv6 address specifications of DNS servers to use. Each address can optionally take a port number
           separated with ":", a network interface name or index separated with "%", and a Server Name
           Indication (SNI) separated with "#". When IPv6 address is specified with a port number, then the
           address must be in the square brackets. That is, the acceptable full formats are
           "111.222.333.444:9953%ifname#example.com" for IPv4 and "[1111:2222::3333]:9953%ifname#example.com"
           for IPv6. The <b>domain</b> command expects valid DNS domains, possibly prefixed with "~", and configures a
           per-interface search or route-only domain. The <b>default-route</b> command expects a boolean parameter, and
           configures whether the link may be used as default route for DNS lookups, i.e. if it is suitable for
           lookups on domains no other link explicitly is configured for. The <b>llmnr</b>, <b>mdns</b>, <b>dnssec</b> and <b>dnsovertls</b>
           commands may be used to configure the per-interface LLMNR, MulticastDNS, DNSSEC and DNSOverTLS
           settings. Finally, <b>nta</b> command may be used to configure additional per-interface DNSSEC NTA domains.

           Commands <b>dns</b>, <b>domain</b> and <b>nta</b> can take a single empty string argument to clear their respective value
           lists.

           For details about these settings, their possible values and their effect, see the corresponding
           settings in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.network.5.html">systemd.network</a></b>(5).

           Added in version 239.

       <b>revert</b> <u>LINK</u>
           Revert the per-interface DNS configuration. If the DNS configuration is reverted all per-interface
           DNS setting are reset to their defaults, undoing all effects of <b>dns</b>, <b>domain</b>, <b>default-route</b>, <b>llmnr</b>,
           <b>mdns</b>, <b>dnssec</b>, <b>dnsovertls</b>, <b>nta</b>. Note that when a network interface disappears all configuration is
           lost automatically, an explicit reverting is not necessary in that case.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>monitor</b>
           Show a continuous stream of local client resolution queries and their responses. Whenever a local
           query is completed the query's DNS resource lookup key and resource records are shown. Note that this
           displays queries issued locally only, and does not immediately relate to DNS requests submitted to
           configured DNS servers or the LLMNR or MulticastDNS zones, as lookups may be answered from the local
           cache, or might result in multiple DNS transactions (for example to validate DNSSEC information). If
           CNAME/CNAME redirection chains are followed, a separate query will be displayed for each element of
           the chain. Use <b>--json=</b> to enable JSON output.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>show-cache</b>
           Show current cache content, per scope. Use <b>--json=</b> to enable JSON output.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>show-server-state</b>
           Show detailed server state information, per DNS Server. Use <b>--json=</b> to enable JSON output.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>log-level</b> [<u>LEVEL</u>]
           If no argument is given, print the current log level of the manager. If an optional argument <u>LEVEL</u> is
           provided, then the command changes the current log level of the manager to <u>LEVEL</u> (accepts the same
           values as <b>--log-level=</b> described in <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1)).

           Added in version 244.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-4</b>, <b>-6</b>
           By default, when resolving a hostname, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are acquired. By specifying <b>-4</b>
           only IPv4 addresses are requested, by specifying <b>-6</b> only IPv6 addresses are requested.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-i</b> <u>INTERFACE</u>, <b>--interface=</b><u>INTERFACE</u>
           Specifies the network interface to execute the query on. This may either be specified as numeric
           interface index or as network interface string (e.g.  "en0"). Note that this option has no effect if
           system-wide DNS configuration (as configured in <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> or <a href="file:/etc/systemd/resolved.conf">/etc/systemd/resolved.conf</a>) in
           place of per-link configuration is used.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-p</b> <u>PROTOCOL</u>, <b>--protocol=</b><u>PROTOCOL</u>
           Specifies the network protocol for the query. May be one of "dns" (i.e. classic unicast DNS), "llmnr"
           (<b>Link-Local</b> <b>Multicast</b> <b>Name</b> <b>Resolution</b>[5]), "llmnr-ipv4", "llmnr-ipv6" (LLMNR via the indicated
           underlying IP protocols), "mdns" (<b>Multicast</b> <b>DNS</b>[6]), "mdns-ipv4", "mdns-ipv6" (MDNS via the indicated
           underlying IP protocols). By default the lookup is done via all protocols suitable for the lookup. If
           used, limits the set of protocols that may be used. Use this option multiple times to enable
           resolving via multiple protocols at the same time. The setting "llmnr" is identical to specifying
           this switch once with "llmnr-ipv4" and once via "llmnr-ipv6". Note that this option does not force
           the service to resolve the operation with the specified protocol, as that might require a suitable
           network interface and configuration. The special value "help" may be used to list known values.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-t</b> <u>TYPE</u>, <b>--type=</b><u>TYPE</u>, <b>-c</b> <u>CLASS</u>, <b>--class=</b><u>CLASS</u>
           When used in conjunction with the <b>query</b> command, specifies the DNS resource record type (e.g.  <b>A</b>,
           <b>AAAA</b>, <b>MX</b>, ...) and class (e.g.  <b>IN</b>, <b>ANY</b>, ...) to look up. If these options are used a DNS resource
           record set matching the specified class and type is requested. The class defaults to <b>IN</b> if only a
           type is specified. The special value "help" may be used to list known values.

           Without these options <b>resolvectl</b> <b>query</b> provides high-level domain name to address and address to
           domain name resolution. With these options it provides low-level DNS resource record resolution. The
           search domain logic is automatically turned off when these options are used, i.e. specified domain
           names need to be fully qualified domain names. Moreover, IDNA internal domain name translation is
           turned off as well, i.e. international domain names should be specified in "xn--..."  notation,
           unless look-up in MulticastDNS/LLMNR is desired, in which case UTF-8 characters should be used.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--service-address=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Takes a boolean parameter. If true (the default), when doing a service lookup with <b>--service</b> the
           hostnames contained in the <b>SRV</b> resource records are resolved as well.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--service-txt=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Takes a boolean parameter. If true (the default), when doing a DNS-SD service lookup with <b>--service</b>
           the <b>TXT</b> service metadata record is resolved as well.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--cname=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Takes a boolean parameter. If true (the default), DNS <b>CNAME</b> or <b>DNAME</b> redirections are followed.
           Otherwise, if a CNAME or DNAME record is encountered while resolving, an error is returned.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--validate=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <b>query</b>. If true (the default), DNSSEC validation
           is applied as usual — under the condition that it is enabled for the network and for
           systemd-resolved.service as a whole. If false, DNSSEC validation is disabled for the specific query,
           regardless of whether it is enabled for the network or in the service. Note that setting this option
           to true does not force DNSSEC validation on systems/networks where DNSSEC is turned off. This option
           is only suitable to turn off such validation where otherwise enabled, not enable validation where
           otherwise disabled.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--synthesize=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <b>query</b>. If true (the default), select domains are
           resolved on the local system, among them "localhost", "_gateway", "_outbound", "_localdnsstub" and
           "_localdnsproxy" or entries from /etc/hosts. If false these domains are not resolved locally, and
           either fail (in case of "localhost", "_gateway" or "_outbound" and suchlike) or go to the network via
           regular DNS/mDNS/LLMNR lookups (in case of <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a> entries).

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--cache=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <b>query</b>. If true (the default), lookups use the
           local DNS resource record cache. If false, lookups are routed to the network instead, regardless if
           already available in the local cache.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--zone=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <b>query</b>. If true (the default), lookups are
           answered from locally registered LLMNR or mDNS resource records, if defined. If false, locally
           registered LLMNR/mDNS records are not considered for the lookup request.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--trust-anchor=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <b>query</b>. If true (the default), lookups for DS and
           DNSKEY are answered from the local DNSSEC trust anchors if possible. If false, the local trust store
           is not considered for the lookup request.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--network=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <b>query</b>. If true (the default), lookups are
           answered via DNS, LLMNR or mDNS network requests if they cannot be synthesized locally, or be
           answered from the local cache, zone or trust anchors (see above). If false, the request is not
           answered from the network and will thus fail if none of the indicated sources can answer them.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--search=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Takes a boolean parameter. If true (the default), any specified single-label hostnames will be
           searched in the domains configured in the search domain list, if it is non-empty. Otherwise, the
           search domain logic is disabled. Note that this option has no effect if <b>--type=</b> is used (see above),
           in which case the search domain logic is unconditionally turned off.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--raw</b>[=payload|packet]
           Dump the answer as binary data. If there is no argument or if the argument is "payload", the payload
           of the packet is exported. If the argument is "packet", the whole packet is dumped in wire format,
           prefixed by length specified as a little-endian 64-bit number. This format allows multiple packets to
           be dumped and unambiguously parsed.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--legend=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Takes a boolean parameter. If true (the default), column headers and meta information about the query
           response are shown. Otherwise, this output is suppressed.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--stale-data=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <b>query</b>. If true (the default), lookups are
           answered with stale data (expired resource records) if possible. If false, the stale data is not
           considered for the lookup request.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>--relax-single-label=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <b>query</b>. If true, rules regarding routing of
           single-label names are relaxed. Defaults to false. By default, lookups of single-label names are
           assumed to refer to local hosts to be resolved via local resolution such as LLMNR or via search
           domain qualification and are not routed to upstream servers as is. If this option is enabled these
           rules are disabled and the queries are routed upstream anyway. Also see the
           <u>ResolveUnicastSingleLabel=</u> option in <b><a href="../man5/resolved.conf.5.html">resolved.conf</a></b>(5) which provides a system-wide option that
           controls this behaviour.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--no-ask-password</b>
           Do not query the user for authentication for privileged operations.

       <b>--json=</b><u>MODE</u>
           Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for the shortest possible output without any
           redundant whitespace or line breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same, with indentation
           and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON output, the default).

       <b>-j</b>
           Equivalent to <b>--json=pretty</b> if running on a terminal, and <b>--json=short</b> otherwise.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>WITH</b> <b><a href="../man8/RESOLVCONF.8.html">RESOLVCONF</a>(8)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>resolvectl</b> is a multi-call binary. When invoked as "resolvconf" (generally achieved by means of a
       symbolic link of this name to the <b>resolvectl</b> binary) it is run in a limited <b><a href="../man8/resolvconf.8.html">resolvconf</a></b>(8) compatibility
       mode. It accepts mostly the same arguments and pushes all data into <b><a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service</a></b>(8), similar
       to how <b>dns</b> and <b>domain</b> commands operate. Note that <b>systemd-resolved.service</b> is the only supported backend,
       which is different from other implementations of this command.

       <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> will only be updated with servers added with this command when <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> is a
       symlink to <a href="file:/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf">/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf</a>, and not a static file. See the discussion of
       <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> handling in <b><a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service</a></b>(8).

       Not all operations supported by other implementations are supported natively. Specifically:

       <b>-a</b>
           Registers per-interface DNS configuration data with <b>systemd-resolved</b>. Expects a network interface
           name as only command line argument. Reads <b><a href="../man5/resolv.conf.5.html">resolv.conf</a></b>(5)-compatible DNS configuration data from its
           standard input. Relevant fields are "nameserver" and "domain"/"search". This command is mostly
           identical to invoking <b>resolvectl</b> with a combination of <b>dns</b> and <b>domain</b> commands.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-d</b>
           Unregisters per-interface DNS configuration data with <b>systemd-resolved</b>. This command is mostly
           identical to invoking <b>resolvectl</b> <b>revert</b>.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-f</b>
           When specified <b>-a</b> and <b>-d</b> will not complain about missing network interfaces and will silently execute
           no operation in that case.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-x</b>
           This switch for "exclusive" operation is supported only partially. It is mapped to an additional
           configured search domain of "~."  — i.e. ensures that DNS traffic is preferably routed to the DNS
           servers on this interface, unless there are other, more specific domains configured on other
           interfaces.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-p</b>
           When specified, the interface will not be used as the default route. See also <b><a href="../man8/systemdresolved.service.8.html">systemd-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man8/systemdresolved.service.8.html">resolved.service</a></b>(8) about the default route.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>-m</b>
           The switch is not supported and is silently ignored.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>-I</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>-l</b>, <b>-R</b>, <b>-r</b>, <b>-v</b>, <b>-V</b>, <b>--enable-updates</b>, <b>--disable-updates</b>, <b>--are-updates-enabled</b>
           These switches are not supported and the command will fail if used.

           Added in version 239.

       See <b><a href="../man8/resolvconf.8.html">resolvconf</a></b>(8) for details on those command line options.
