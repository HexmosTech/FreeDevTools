       portablectl - Attach, detach or inspect portable service images

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>portablectl</b> [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND} [NAME...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>portablectl</b> may be used to attach, detach or inspect portable service images. It's primarily a command
       interfacing with <b><a href="../man8/systemd-portabled.service.8.html">systemd-portabled.service</a></b>(8).

       Portable service images contain an OS file system tree along with <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) unit file information. A
       service image may be "attached" to the local system. If attached, a set of unit files are copied from the
       image to the host, and extended with <u>RootDirectory=</u> or <u>RootImage=</u> assignments (in case of service units)
       pointing to the image file or directory, ensuring the services will run within the file system context of
       the image.

       Portable service images are an efficient way to bundle multiple related services and other units
       together, and transfer them as a whole between systems. When these images are attached to the local
       system, the contained units may run in most ways like regular system-provided units, either with full
       privileges or inside strict sandboxing, depending on the selected configuration. For more details, see
       <b>Portable</b> <b>Services</b>[1].

       Portable service images may be of the following kinds:

       •   Directory trees containing an OS, including the top-level directories <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>, <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>, and so on.

       •   btrfs subvolumes containing OS trees, similar to normal directory trees.

       •   Binary "raw" disk images containing MBR or GPT partition tables and Linux file system partitions.
           (These must be regular files, with the .raw suffix.)

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following commands are understood:

       <b>list</b>
           List available portable service images. This will list all portable service images discovered in the
           portable image search paths (see below), along with brief metadata and state information. Note that
           many of the commands below may both operate on images inside and outside of the search paths. This
           command is hence mostly a convenience option, the commands are generally not restricted to what this
           list shows.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>attach</b> <u>IMAGE</u> [<u>PREFIX...</u>]
           Attach a portable service image to the host system. Expects a file system path to a portable service
           image file or directory as first argument. If the specified path contains no slash character ("/") it
           is understood as image filename that is searched for in the portable service image search paths (see
           below). To reference a file in the current working directory prefix the filename with "./" to avoid
           this search path logic.

           When a portable service is attached four operations are executed:

            1. All unit files of types .service, .socket, .target, .timer and .path which match the indicated
               unit file name prefix are copied from the image to the host's /etc/systemd/system.attached/
               directory (or /run/systemd/system.attached/ — depending whether <b>--runtime</b> is specified, see
               below), which is included in the built-in unit search path of the system service manager.

            2. For unit files of type .service a drop-in is added to these copies that adds <u>RootDirectory=</u> or
               <u>RootImage=</u> settings (see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5) for details), that ensures these services are run within
               the file system of the originating portable service image.

            3. A second drop-in is created: the "profile" drop-in, that may contain additional security settings
               (and other settings). A number of profiles are available by default but administrators may define
               their own ones. See below.

            4. If the portable service image file is not already in the search path (see below), a symbolic link
               to it is created in /etc/portables/ or /run/portables/, to make sure it is included in it.

           By default all unit files whose names start with a prefix generated from the image's file name are
           copied out. Specifically, the prefix is determined from the image file name with any suffix such as
           .raw removed, truncated at the first occurrence of an underscore character ("_"), if there is one.
           The underscore logic is supposed to be used to versioning so that the an image file foobar_47.11.raw
           will result in a unit file matching prefix of foobar. This prefix is then compared with all unit
           files names contained in the image in the usual directories, but only unit file names where the
           prefix is followed by "-", "."  or "@" are considered. Example: if a portable service image file is
           named foobar_47.11.raw then by default all its unit files with names such as
           foobar-quux-waldi.service, foobar.service or foobar@.service will be considered. It's possible to
           override the matching prefix: all strings listed on the command line after the image file name are
           considered prefixes, overriding the implicit logic where the prefix is derived from the image file
           name.

           By default, after the unit files are attached the service manager's configuration is reloaded, except
           when <b>--no-reload</b> is specified (see below). This ensures that the new units made available to the
           service manager are seen by it.

           If <b>--now</b> and/or <b>--enable</b> are passed, the portable services are immediately started (blocking
           operation unless <b>--no-block</b> is passed) and/or enabled after attaching the image.

           In place of the image path a ".v/" versioned directory may be specified, see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.v.7.html">systemd.v</a></b>(7) for
           details.

           In place of the directory path a ".v/" versioned directory may be specified, see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.v.7.html">systemd.v</a></b>(7) for
           details.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>detach</b> <u>IMAGE</u> [<u>PREFIX...</u>]
           Detaches a portable service image from the host. This undoes the operations executed by the <b>attach</b>
           command above, and removes the unit file copies, drop-ins and image symlink again. This command
           expects an image name or path as parameter. Note that if a path is specified only the last component
           of it (i.e. the file or directory name itself, not the path to it) is used for finding matching unit
           files. This is a convenience feature to allow all arguments passed as <b>attach</b> also to <b>detach</b>.

           If <b>--now</b> and/or <b>--enable</b> are passed, the portable services are immediately stopped (blocking
           operation) and/or disabled before detaching the image. Prefix(es) are also accepted, to be used in
           case the unit names do not match the image name as described in the <b>attach</b>.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>reattach</b> <u>IMAGE</u> [<u>PREFIX...</u>]
           Detaches an existing portable service image from the host, and immediately attaches it again. This is
           useful in case the image was replaced. Running units are not stopped during the process. Partial
           matching, to allow for different versions in the image name, is allowed: only the part before the
           first "_" character has to match. If the new image doesn't exist, the existing one will not be
           detached. The parameters follow the same syntax as the <b>attach</b> command.

           If <b>--now</b> and/or <b>--enable</b> are passed, the portable services are immediately stopped if removed,
           started and/or enabled if added, or restarted if updated. Prefixes are also accepted, in the same way
           as described in the <b>attach</b> case.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>inspect</b> <u>IMAGE</u> [<u>PREFIX...</u>]
           Extracts various metadata from a portable service image and presents it to the caller. Specifically,
           the <b><a href="../man5/os-release.5.html">os-release</a></b>(5) file of the image is retrieved as well as all matching unit files. By default a
           short summary showing the most relevant metadata in combination with a list of matching unit files is
           shown (that is the unit files <b>attach</b> would install to the host system). If combined with <b>--cat</b> (see
           above), the os-release data and the units files' contents is displayed unprocessed. This command is
           useful to determine whether an image qualifies as portable service image, and which unit files are
           included. This command expects the path to the image as parameter, optionally followed by a list of
           unit file prefixes to consider, similar to the <b>attach</b> command described above.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>is-attached</b> <u>IMAGE</u>
           Determines whether the specified image is currently attached or not. Unless combined with the <b>--quiet</b>
           switch this will show a short state identifier for the image. Specifically:

           Added in version 239.

       <b>read-only</b> <u>IMAGE</u> [<u>BOOL</u>]
           Marks or (unmarks) a portable service image read-only. Takes an image name, followed by a boolean as
           arguments. If the boolean is omitted, positive is implied, i.e. the image is marked read-only.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>remove</b> <u>IMAGE</u>...
           Removes one or more portable service images. Note that this command will only remove the specified
           image path itself — it refers to a symbolic link then the symbolic link is removed and not the image
           it points to.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>set-limit</b> [<u>IMAGE</u>] <u>BYTES</u>
           Sets the maximum size in bytes that a specific portable service image, or all images, may grow up to
           on disk (disk quota). Takes either one or two parameters. The first, optional parameter refers to a
           portable service image name. If specified, the size limit of the specified image is changed. If
           omitted, the overall size limit of the sum of all images stored locally is changed. The final
           argument specifies the size limit in bytes, possibly suffixed by the usual K, M, G, T units. If the
           size limit shall be disabled, specify "-" as size.

           Note that per-image size limits are only supported on btrfs file systems. Also, depending on
           <u>BindPaths=</u> settings in the portable service's unit files directories from the host might be visible
           in the image environment during runtime which are not affected by this setting, as only the image
           itself is counted against this limit.

           Added in version 239.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Suppresses additional informational output while running.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-p</b> <u>PROFILE</u>, <b>--profile=</b><u>PROFILE</u>
           When attaching an image, select the profile to use. By default the "default" profile is used. For
           details about profiles, see below.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--copy=</b>
           When attaching an image, select whether to prefer copying or symlinking of files installed into the
           host system. Takes one of "copy" (files will be copied), "symlink" (to prefer creation of symbolic
           links), "auto" for an intermediary mode where security profile drop-ins and images are symlinked
           while unit files are copied, or "mixed" (since v256) where security profile drop-ins are symlinked
           while unit files and images are copied. Note that this option expresses a preference only, in cases
           where symbolic links cannot be created — for example when the image operated on is a raw disk image,
           and hence not directly referentiable from the host file system — copying of files is used
           unconditionally.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--runtime</b>
           When specified the unit and drop-in files are placed in /run/systemd/system.attached/ instead of
           /etc/systemd/system.attached/. Images attached with this option set hence remain attached only until
           the next reboot, while they are normally attached persistently.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--no-reload</b>
           Don't reload the service manager after attaching or detaching a portable service image. Normally the
           service manager is reloaded to ensure it is aware of added or removed unit files.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--cat</b>
           When inspecting portable service images, show the (unprocessed) contents of the metadata files pulled
           from the image, instead of brief summaries. Specifically, this will show the <b><a href="../man5/os-release.5.html">os-release</a></b>(5) and unit
           file contents of the image.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--enable</b>
           Immediately enable/disable the portable service after attaching/detaching.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>--now</b>
           Immediately start/stop/restart the portable service after attaching/before detaching/after upgrading.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>--no-block</b>
           Don't block waiting for attach --now to complete.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>--clean</b>
           When detaching ensure the configuration, state, logs, cache, and runtime data directories of the
           portable service are removed from the host system.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--extension=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Add an additional image <u>PATH</u> as an overlay on top of <u>IMAGE</u> when attaching/detaching. This argument
           can be specified multiple times, in which case the order in which images are laid down follows the
           rules specified in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5) for the <u>ExtensionImages=</u> directive and for the <b><a href="../man8/systemd-sysext.8.html">systemd-sysext</a></b>(8)
           and <b><a href="../man8/systemd-confext.8.html">systemd-confext</a></b>(8) tools. The images must contain an extension-release file with metadata that
           matches what is defined in the os-release of <u>IMAGE</u>. See: <b><a href="../man5/os-release.5.html">os-release</a></b>(5). Images can be block images,
           btrfs subvolumes or directories. For more information on portable services with extensions, see the
           "Extension Images" paragraph on <b>Portable</b> <b>Services</b>[1].

           Note that the same extensions have to be specified, in the same order, when attaching and detaching.

           In place of the image path a ".v/" versioned directory may be specified, see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.v.7.html">systemd.v</a></b>(7) for
           details.

           In place of the directory path a ".v/" versioned directory may be specified, see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.v.7.html">systemd.v</a></b>(7) for
           details.

           Added in version 249.

       <b>--force</b>
           Skip safety checks and attach or detach images (with extensions) without first ensuring that the
           units are not running, and do not insist that the extension-release.<u>NAME</u> file in the extension image
           has to match the image filename.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--host=</b>
           Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a username and hostname separated by "@", to
           connect to. The hostname may optionally be suffixed by a port ssh is listening on, separated by ":",
           and then a container name, separated by "/", which connects directly to a specific container on the
           specified host. This will use SSH to talk to the remote machine manager instance. Container names may
           be enumerated with <b>machinectl</b> <b>-H</b> <u>HOST</u>. Put IPv6 addresses in brackets.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--machine=</b>
           Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container name to connect to, optionally prefixed
           by a user name to connect as and a separating "@" character. If the special string ".host" is used in
           place of the container name, a connection to the local system is made (which is useful to connect to
           a specific user's user bus: "--user --machine=lennart@.host"). If the "@" syntax is not used, the
           connection is made as root user. If the "@" syntax is used either the left hand side or the right
           hand side may be omitted (but not both) in which case the local user name and ".host" are implied.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       <b>--no-legend</b>
           Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer with hints.

       <b>--no-ask-password</b>
           Do not query the user for authentication for privileged operations.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b></h4><pre>
       Portable service images are preferably stored in /var/lib/portables/, but are also searched for in
       /etc/portables/, /run/systemd/portables/, /usr/local/lib/portables/ and /usr/lib/portables/. It's
       recommended not to place image files directly in /etc/portables/ or /run/systemd/portables/ (as these are
       generally not suitable for storing large or non-textual data), but use these directories only for linking
       images located elsewhere into the image search path.

       When a portable service image is attached, matching unit files are copied onto the host into the
       /etc/systemd/system.attached/ and /run/systemd/system.attached/ directories. When an image is detached,
       the unit files are removed again from these directories.

</pre><h4><b>PROFILES</b></h4><pre>
       When portable service images are attached a "profile" drop-in is linked in, which may be used to enforce
       additional security (and other) restrictions locally. Four profile drop-ins are defined by default, and
       shipped in /usr/lib/systemd/portable/profile/. Additional, local profiles may be defined by placing them
       in /etc/systemd/portable/profile/. The default profiles are:

       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL</u>
           The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a higher log level, i.e. less important
           ones, will be suppressed). Takes a comma-separated list of values. A value may be either one of (in
           order of decreasing importance) <b>emerg</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>crit</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>debug</b>, or an integer
           in the range 0...7. See <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3) for more information. Each value may optionally be prefixed with
           one of <b>console</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>kmsg</b> or <b>journal</b> followed by a colon to set the maximum log level for that
           specific log target (e.g.  <b>SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug,console:info</b> specifies to log at debug level
           except when logging to the console which should be at info level). Note that the global maximum log
           level takes priority over any per target maximum log levels.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be colored according to priority.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the terminal, because <b><a href="../man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl</a></b>(1)
           and other tools that display logs will color messages based on the log level on their own.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME</u>
           A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed with a timestamp.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the terminal or a file, because
           <b><a href="../man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl</a></b>(1) and other tools that display logs will attach timestamps based on the entry metadata on
           their own.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename and line number in the source code
           where the message originates.

           Note that the log location is often attached as metadata to journal entries anyway. Including it
           directly in the message text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TID</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with the current numerical thread ID (TID).

           Note that the this information is attached as metadata to journal entries anyway. Including it
           directly in the message text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET</u>
           The destination for log messages. One of <b>console</b> (log to the attached tty), <b>console-prefixed</b> (log to
           the attached tty but with prefixes encoding the log level and "facility", see <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3), <b>kmsg</b> (log to
           the kernel circular log buffer), <b>journal</b> (log to the journal), <b>journal-or-kmsg</b> (log to the journal if
           available, and to kmsg otherwise), <b>auto</b> (determine the appropriate log target automatically, the
           default), <b>null</b> (disable log output).

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_RATELIMIT_KMSG</u>
           Whether to ratelimit kmsg or not. Takes a boolean. Defaults to "true". If disabled, systemd will not
           ratelimit messages written to kmsg.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u>
           Pager to use when <b>--no-pager</b> is not given; overrides <u>$PAGER</u>. If neither <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> nor <u>$PAGER</u> are
           set, a set of well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></b>(1),
           until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting this
           environment variable to an empty string or the value "cat" is equivalent to passing <b>--no-pager</b>.

           Note: if <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set, <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> (as well as <u>$PAGER</u>) will be silently
           ignored.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LESS</u>
           Override the options passed to <b>less</b> (by default "FRSXMK").

           Users might want to change two options in particular:

           <b>K</b>
               This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when Ctrl+C is pressed. To allow <b>less</b> to
               handle Ctrl+C itself to switch back to the pager command prompt, unset this option.

               If the value of <u>$SYSTEMD_LESS</u> does not include "K", and the pager that is invoked is <b>less</b>, Ctrl+C
               will be ignored by the executable, and needs to be handled by the pager.

           <b>X</b>
               This option instructs the pager to not send termcap initialization and deinitialization strings
               to the terminal. It is set by default to allow command output to remain visible in the terminal
               even after the pager exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager functionality from working, in
               particular paged output cannot be scrolled with the mouse.

           Note that setting the regular <u>$LESS</u> environment variable has no effect for <b>less</b> invocations by
           systemd tools.

           See <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) for more discussion.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET</u>
           Override the charset passed to <b>less</b> (by default "utf-8", if the invoking terminal is determined to be
           UTF-8 compatible).

           Note that setting the regular <u>$LESSCHARSET</u> environment variable has no effect for <b>less</b> invocations by
           systemd tools.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, the "secure" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled.
           If <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the
           same as the owner of the login session, see <b><a href="../man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid</a></b>(2) and <b><a href="../man3/sd_pid_get_owner_uid.3.html">sd_pid_get_owner_uid</a></b>(3). In secure mode,
           <b>LESSSECURE=1</b> will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or
           create new files or start new subprocesses. When <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set at all, pagers which
           are not known to implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) implements secure
           mode.)

           Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for example under <b><a href="../man8/sudo.8.html">sudo</a></b>(8) or <b><a href="../man1/pkexec.1.html">pkexec</a></b>(1),
           care must be taken to ensure that unintended interactive features are not enabled. "Secure" mode for
           the pager may be enabled automatically as describe above. Setting <u>SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0</u> or not
           removing it from the inherited environment allows the user to invoke arbitrary commands. Note that if
           the <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> or <u>$PAGER</u> variables are to be honoured, <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> must be set too. It
           might be reasonable to completely disable the pager using <b>--no-pager</b> instead.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_COLORS</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, <b>systemd</b> and related utilities will use colors in their output,
           otherwise the output will be monochrome. Additionally, the variable can take one of the following
           special values: "16", "256" to restrict the use of colors to the base 16 or 256 ANSI colors,
           respectively. This can be specified to override the automatic decision based on <u>$TERM</u> and what the
           console is connected to.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_URLIFY</u>
           The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should be generated in the output for
           terminal emulators supporting this. This can be specified to override the decision that <b>systemd</b> makes
           based on <u>$TERM</u> and other conditions.
