</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xxkb - switches and indicates a current keyboard layout.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xxkb</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>xxkb</b>  program  shows the current keyboard layout (an XKB group) and allows to switch it with a mouse
       click. It has some additional features.  The <b>xxkb</b> remembers the layout for each  application  window  and
       changes  the  keyboard  state  accordingly when the window gets a focus. The <b>xxkb</b> can place an additional
       button on a window title bar and that button is a switcher and an indicator for that separate window.  If
       the  keyboard  map has more than two layouts the <b>xxkb</b> can simplify a switching using a <b>two_state</b> mode. In
       this mode the <b>xxkb</b> allows to choose two layouts, one as a base layout and another one as  an  alternative
       layout  and  then  switch the keyboard state between them only. Also the <b>xxkb</b> supports applications lists
       which allow to tune its behavior for some separate applications.
         The <b>xxkb</b> works with any window manager.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Working as an indicator the <b>xxkb</b> shows a current XKB layout using one of four  pixmaps  and  changes  the
       pixmap  when you change a layout with the keyboard (using the key or the key combination specified in the
       config file as an XKB group switcher) or using any other application which able to change the XKB  group.
       Also  the  <b>xxkb</b>  shows  the similar pixmaps on each application window title bar which are indicators for
       separate windows. Since the global indicator and the per window indicators duplicates each other you  can
       hide the global indicator or all per window indicators using configure options.
         Also  you  can  use the <b>xxkb</b> as a layout switcher using a mouse button click on the main <b>xxkb</b> window or
       one of the per window indicators.  In last case you switch the layout for the chosen application.

       <b>MouseButton1</b>
           The first button acts as a layout switcher. If the <b>two_state</b> mode is active the button click switches
           the current layout between two selected layouts (XKB  groups).  Otherwise  it  selects  all  possible
           layouts in cycle.

       <b>MouseButton3</b>
           When  the  <b>two_state</b>  mode is switched on the third button allows to choose an alternative layout. It
           selects all possible layouts in cycle and the layout you stop  on  becomes  the  alternative  layout.
           Without the <b>two_state</b> mode this button action is the same as the first button action.

       <b>MouseButton2</b>
           The  second  (middle)  button  action  depends  on  the place where you click.  The click on the main
           indicator terminates the <b>xxkb</b>. But the click on one of the per window indicators simply  removes  the
           indicator  from the title bar and excludes that application from a set of managed applications.  Also
           the second button allows you to add an application into one of three lists of the applications  which
           should  be  ignored  (see the <b>Applications</b> <b>lists</b> <b>options</b> below). Clicking on the per window indicator
           when the <b>Control</b> key is pressed you add this application to the <b>wm_class_class</b> list. If the <b>Shift</b> key
           is pressed the button click adds the application to the <b>wm_name</b> list. If both keys  are  pressed  the
           click  adds  the application to the <b>wm_class_name</b> list.  In all cases the updated lists will be saved
           in a per user config file <u><a href="file:~/.xxkbrc">~/.xxkbrc</a></u>.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>xxkb</b> reads all configure options from two files <u>app-defaults/XXkb</u> and <u><a href="file:~/.xxkbrc">~/.xxkbrc</a></u>.

</pre><h4><b>Common</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XXkb.image.path</b>
           The directory where the <b>xxkb</b> searches pixmap files.

</pre><h4><b>Main</b> <b>window</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XXkb.mainwindow.enable</b>
           switch on the <b>xxkb</b> main window (yes by default). If a <u>per</u> <u>window</u> <u>button</u> mode switched on  some  users
           prefer to hide the main window of the <b>xxkb</b>.

       <b>XXkb.mainwindow.appicon</b>
           run <b>xxkb</b> as an animated icon. It is useful for window managers which allow 'to dock' applications.

       <b>XXkb.mainwindow.in_tray</b>
           allow to dock <b>xxkb</b> into a system tray. A value is either true or false.

       <b>XXkb.mainwindow.geometry</b>
           the  geometry  (  WIDTHxHEIGHT{+-}XOFF{+-}YOFF  )  of  the  main  window.  Please  read  the <b>GEOMETRY</b>
           <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b> section of <a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a>(7) for details.

       <b>XXkb.mainwindow.border.color</b>
           color to be used when drawing window border.

       <b>XXkb.mainwindow.border.width</b>
           border width in pixels.

       <b>XXkb.mainwindow.image.N</b>
           pixmap file names for each indicated group N. If your symbols map  has  less  than  four  groups  the
           unused  group icons can be omitted. If the file name begins from '/' it means full path for the file.
           Otherwise it means the relative path beginning from the <b>XXkb.image.path</b> value.

       <b>XXkb.mainwindow.label.enable</b>
           enable labels to be printed instead of images. Group descriptions will be used if not overwritten  by
           <b>XXkb.mainwindow.label.text.N</b> (where N is 1..4, group number) options.

       <b>XXkb.mainwindow.label.text.N</b>
           label for the specified group N.

       <b>XXkb.mainwindow.label.background</b>

       <b>XXkb.mainwindow.label.foreground</b>
           colors used to draw background and label text respectively.

       <b>XXkb.mainwindow.label.font</b>
           font to be used when drawing labels.

</pre><h4><b>Operation</b> <b>mode</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       Since  the  <b>xxkb</b> can keep the keyboard state for each application and restore the state when the focus is
       changed there are group of options which controls how the <b>xxkb</b> finds the application windows.

       <b>XXkb.controls.add_when_start</b>
           If this mode is switched on (default) the <b>xxkb</b> at start time tries to find  all  application  already
           run.

       <b>XXkb.controls.add_when_create</b>
           In  this  mode  the <b>xxkb</b> gets a new application window at time when the application creates it. It is
           the base mode but I can't guaranty it works with all window managers.

       <b>XXkb.controls.add_when_change</b>
           In this mode the <b>xxkb</b> doesn't catch the windows at their creation but adds  windows  to  the  managed
           windows  list  if the keyboard state changes when the window is focused. It's an additional mode (not
           recommended) and may be useful only if the <b>add_when_create</b> mode for some reason doesn't work.

       <b>XXkb.controls.focusout</b>
           It makes the <b>xxkb</b> reset the keyboard group when the focus leaves the window.  The  mode  makes  sense
           with the <b>add_when_change</b> mode only.

       <b>XXkb.controls.button_delete</b>
           This  mode  (switched on by default) allows user to remove the per window button using a mouse middle
           button click. Although the <b>xxkb</b> tries to ignore the  windows  where  the  keyboard  layout  switching
           doesn't make sense, such windows can still appear. Or there are windows where an user for some reason
           doesn't want to have the button.

       <b>XXkb.controls.button_delete_and_forget</b>
           This  mode  in  addition to previous one makes <b>xxkb</b> to forget the window which button is deleted.  It
           means the <b>xxkb</b> will not remember the keyboard state changes in this window  and  restore  this  state
           when the window will be focused.

       <b>XXkb.controls.two_state</b>
           Switching  between two chosen keyboard layouts only.  If the XKB symbols map has more than two groups
           and not all of them are needed for each application the <b>xxkb</b> allows to skip unneeded layouts  at  the
           layout  switching.  You  can select one group as a base group and another one as an alternative group
           and then switch between these two groups only.   The  base  group  is  common  for  all  applications
           (usually  it  contains  ASCII)  but  the  alternative group can be chosen for each application window
           separately.  In this mode a mouse right button allows to select the alternative  group  and  a  mouse
           left  button  as  well  as  the  key which configured as the layout switcher change the current state
           between two selected layouts only.
             This mode uses two additional config options:

       <b>XXkb.group.base</b>
           the base group (integer 1..4).

       <b>XXkb.group.alt</b>
           the default alternative group (integer 1..4).

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>application</b> <b>window</b> <b>button</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       All these options make sense if the <b>XXkb.button.enable</b> switched on.

       <b>XXkb.button.enable</b>
           If turned on, the <b>xxkb</b> adds an additional button to a title bar of each managed window which  is  the
           indicator  and  the  layout  switcher for that particular window.  These buttons are not usual window
           manager buttons but windows (with a pixmap) owned by the <b>xxkb</b> itself. It means that in some  cases  a
           user  needs  to  tune  the  button  size  and  the position for the button look like a window manager
           decoration element.

       <b>XXkb.button.geometry</b>
           the button geometry ( WIDTHxHEIGHT{+-}XOFF{+-}YOFF ).

       <b>XXkb.button.image.N</b>
           the pixmap file names (the same as for the <b>XXkb.mainwindow.image.*</b> options).

       <b>XXkb.button.label.enable</b>

       <b>XXkb.button.label.text.N</b>

       <b>XXkb.button.label.background</b>

       <b>XXkb.button.label.foreground</b>

       <b>XXkb.button.label.font</b>

       <b>XXkb.button.border.color</b>

       <b>XXkb.button.border.width</b>
           see description of their main window counterparts.

</pre><h4><b>Bell</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XXkb.bell.enable</b>
           enables the keyboard bell when the layout changes.

       <b>XXkb.bell.percent</b>
           an argument value for the XBell call.

</pre><h4><b>Applications</b> <b>lists</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>xxkb</b> allows to specify lists of applications that requires some special actions. The applications can
       be specified using their <b>WM_CLASS</b> or <b>WM_NAME</b> properties.
         A common form of such option is

       <b>XXkb.app_list.</b><u>property</u><b>.</b><u>action</u><b>:</b> <u>an</u> <u>applications</u> <u>list</u>

         The <u>action</u> here can be one of <b>ignore</b>, <b>start_alt</b> or <b>alt_group</b><u>n</u>.  The <b>ignore</b> action means that  the  <b>xxkb</b>
       must  ignore  the  windows  of  those  applications  and doesn't add them to the managed windows set. The
       <b>start_alt</b> action means that the <b>xxkb</b> must set the keyboard state  to  the  alternative  layout  when  the
       application starts. And the <b>alt_group1,</b> <b>alt_group2,</b> <b>alt_group3</b> or <b>alt_group4</b> actions allow to specify the
       alternative  layout  for some applications if this layout should be different from the common alternative
       layout specified in the <b>XXkb.group.alt</b> option.
         The <u>property</u> can be one of  <b>wm_class_class,</b>  <b>wm_class_name</b>  or  <b>wm_name</b>.   The  <b>xxkb</b>  can  identify  an
       application  using  its window properties <b>WM_CLASS</b> or <b>WM_NAME</b>. The <b>WM_CLASS</b> property actually consists of
       two parts - a <b>res_class</b> and a <b>res_name</b>. Thus the <u>property</u>  field  specifies  what  property  or  part  of
       property should be considered for the application identification.
         By  default  all these lists are empty. A not empty list is a sequence of words separated by space/tab.
       The <b>xxkb</b> accepts an asterisk as a part of word.  Long lists can be continued to the  next  line  using  a
       backslash as the last char in the line.
         For example:
         XXkb.app_list.wm_name.ignore: Fvwm* *clock .br

                                       Xman

       <b>XXkb.ignore.reverse</b>
           This  option  changes a meaning of the <b>Xxkb.*.ignore</b>  list. If the option switched on the <b>ignore</b> list
           becomes the list of windows which should be managed but all other should be ignored.
