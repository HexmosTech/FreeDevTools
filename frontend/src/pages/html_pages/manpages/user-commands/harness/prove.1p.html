</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <u><b><a href="file:~/.proverc">~/.proverc</a></b></u> <b>/</b> <u><b>./.proverc</b></u>
       If <u><a href="file:~/.proverc">~/.proverc</a></u> or <u>./.proverc</u> exist they will be read and any options they contain processed before the
       command line options. Options in <u>.proverc</u> are specified in the same way as command line options:

           # .proverc
           --state=hot,fast,save
           -j9

       Additional option files may be specified with the "--rc" option.  Default option file processing is
       disabled by the "--norc" option.

       Under Windows and VMS the option file is named <b>_</b><u>proverc</u> rather than <u>.proverc</u> and is sought only in the
       current directory.

   <b>Reading</b> <b>from</b> <b>"STDIN"</b>
       If you have a list of tests (or URLs, or anything else you want to test) in a file, you can add them to
       your tests by using a '-':

        prove - &lt; my_list_of_things_to_test.txt

       See the "README" in the "examples" directory of this distribution.

   <b>Default</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Directory</b>
       If no files or directories are supplied, "prove" looks for all files matching the pattern "t/*.t".

   <b>Colored</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Output</b>
       Colored test output using TAP::Formatter::Color is the default, but if output is not to a terminal, color
       is disabled. You can override this by adding the "--color" switch.

       Color support requires Term::ANSIColor and, on windows platforms, also Win32::Console::ANSI. If the
       necessary module(s) are not installed colored output will not be available.

   <b>Exit</b> <b>Code</b>
       If the tests fail "prove" will exit with non-zero status.

   <b>Arguments</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tests</b>
       It is possible to supply arguments to tests. To do so separate them from prove's own arguments with the
       arisdottle, '::'. For example

        prove -v t/mytest.t :: --url <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>

       would run <u>t/mytest.t</u> with the options '--url <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>'.  When running multiple tests they will
       each receive the same arguments.

   <b>"--exec"</b>
       Normally you can just pass a list of Perl tests and the harness will know how to execute them.  However,
       if your tests are not written in Perl or if you want all tests invoked exactly the same way, use the
       "-e", or "--exec" switch:

        prove --exec '/usr/bin/ruby -w' t/
        prove --exec '<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a> -Tw -mstrict -Ilib' t/
        prove --exec '/path/to/my/customer/exec'

   <b>"--merge"</b>
       If you need to make sure your diagnostics are displayed in the correct order relative to test results you
       can use the "--merge" option to merge the test scripts' STDERR into their STDOUT.

       This guarantees that STDOUT (where the test results appear) and STDERR (where the diagnostics appear)
       will stay in sync. The harness will display any diagnostics your tests emit on STDERR.

       Caveat: this is a bit of a kludge. In particular note that if anything that appears on STDERR looks like
       a test result the test harness will get confused. Use this option only if you understand the consequences
       and can live with the risk.

   <b>"--trap"</b>
       The "--trap" option will attempt to trap SIGINT (Ctrl-C) during a test run and display the test summary
       even if the run is interrupted

   <b>"--state"</b>
       You can ask "prove" to remember the state of previous test runs and select and/or order the tests to be
       run based on that saved state.

       The "--state" switch requires an argument which must be a comma separated list of one or more of the
       following options.

       "last"
           Run  the  same  tests  as  the last time the state was saved. This makes it possible, for example, to
           recreate the ordering of a shuffled test.

               # Run all tests in random order
               $ prove -b --state=save --shuffle

               # Run them again in the same order
               $ prove -b --state=last

       "failed"
           Run only the tests that failed on the last run.

               # Run all tests
               $ prove -b --state=save

               # Run failures
               $ prove -b --state=failed

           If you also specify the "save" option newly passing tests will be excluded from subsequent runs.

               # Repeat until no more failures
               $ prove -b --state=failed,save

       "passed"
           Run only the passed tests from last time. Useful  to  make  sure  that  no  new  problems  have  been
           introduced.

       "all"
           Run  all  tests  in  normal  order.  Multiple  options may be specified, so to run all tests with the
           failures from last time first:

               $ prove -b --state=failed,all,save

       "hot"
           Run the tests that most recently failed first. The last failure time of  each  test  is  stored.  The
           "hot" option causes tests to be run in most-recent- failure order.

               $ prove -b --state=hot,save

           Tests  that  have  never  failed will not be selected. To run all tests with the most recently failed
           first use

               $ prove -b --state=hot,all,save

           This combination of options may also be specified thus

               $ prove -b --state=adrian

       "todo"
           Run any tests with todos.

       "slow"
           Run the tests in slowest to fastest order. This is useful  in  conjunction  with  the  "-j"  parallel
           testing switch to ensure that your slowest tests start running first.

               $ prove -b --state=slow -j9

       "fast"
           Run test tests in fastest to slowest order.

       "new"
           Run the tests in newest to oldest order based on the modification times of the test scripts.

       "old"
           Run the tests in oldest to newest order.

       "fresh"
           Run those test scripts that have been modified since the last test run.

       "save"
           Save  the  state  on exit. The state is stored in a file called <u>.prove</u> (<b>_</b><u>prove</u> on Windows and VMS) in
           the current directory.

       The "--state" switch may be used more than once.

           $ prove -b --state=hot --state=all,save

   <b>--rules</b>
       The "--rules" option is used to control which tests are run sequentially and which are run  in  parallel,
       if the "--jobs" option is specified. The option may be specified multiple times, and the order matters.

       The most practical use is likely to specify that some tests are not "parallel-ready".  Since mentioning a
       file  with  --rules doesn't cause it to be selected to run as a test, you can "set and forget" some rules
       preferences in your .proverc file. Then you'll be able to  take  maximum  advantage  of  the  performance
       benefits of parallel testing, while some exceptions are still run in parallel.

       <u>--rules</u> <u>examples</u>

           # All tests are allowed to run in parallel, except those starting with "p"
           --rules='seq=t/p*.t' --rules='par=**'

           # All tests must run in sequence except those starting with "p", which should be run parallel
           --rules='par=t/p*.t'

       <u>--rules</u> <u>resolution</u>

       •   By  default,  all  tests are eligible to be run in parallel. Specifying any of your own rules removes
           this one.

       •   "First match wins". The first rule that matches a test will be the one that applies.

       •   Any test which does not match a rule will be run in sequence at the end of the run.

       •   The existence of a rule does not imply selecting a test. You must still specify the tests to run.

       •   Specifying a rule to allow tests to run in parallel does not make them run  in  parallel.  You  still
           need specify the number of parallel "jobs" in your Harness object.

       <u>--rules</u> <u>Glob-style</u> <u>pattern</u> <u>matching</u>

       We implement our own glob-style pattern matching for --rules. Here are the supported patterns:

           ** is any number of characters, including /, within a pathname
           * is zero or more characters within a filename/directory name
           ? is exactly one character within a filename/directory name
           {foo,bar,baz} is any of foo, bar or baz.
           \ is an escape character

       <u>More</u> <u>advanced</u> <u>specifications</u> <u>for</u> <u>parallel</u> <u>vs</u> <u>sequence</u> <u>run</u> <u>rules</u>

       If  you need more advanced management of what runs in parallel vs in sequence, see the associated 'rules'
       documentation in TAP::Harness and TAP::Parser::Scheduler.  If what's possible directly through "prove" is
       not sufficient, you can write your own harness to access these features directly.

   <b>@INC</b>
       prove introduces a separation between "options passed to the perl which runs prove" and  "options  passed
       to  the  perl  which  runs  tests";  this distinction is by design. Thus the perl which is running a test
       starts with the default @INC. Additional library directories can be added via the "PERL5LIB"  environment
       variable, via -Ifoo in "PERL5OPT" or via the "-Ilib" option to <u>prove</u>.

   <b>Taint</b> <b>Mode</b>
       Normally  when a Perl program is run in taint mode the contents of the "PERL5LIB" environment variable do
       not appear in @INC.

       Because "PERL5LIB" is often used during testing to add build directories to @INC prove passes  the  names
       of  any  directories  found  in  "PERL5LIB"  as -I switches. The net effect of this is that "PERL5LIB" is
       honoured even when prove is run in taint mode.

</pre><h4><b>FORMATTERS</b></h4><pre>
       You can load a custom TAP::Parser::Formatter:

         prove --formatter MyFormatter

</pre><h4><b>SOURCE</b> <b>HANDLERS</b></h4><pre>
       You can load custom TAP::Parser::SourceHandlers, to change  the  way  the  parser  interprets  particular
       <u>sources</u> of TAP.

         prove --source MyHandler --source YetAnother t

       If you want to provide config to the source you can use:

         prove --source MyCustom \
               --source Perl --perl-option 'foo=bar baz' --perl-option avg=0.278 \
               --source File --file-option extensions=.txt --file-option extensions=.tmp t
               --source pgTAP --pgtap-option pset=format=html --pgtap-option pset=border=2

       Each  "--$source-option"  option must specify a key/value pair separated by an "=". If an option can take
       multiple values, just specify it multiple times, as with the "extensions=" examples above. If the  option
       should  be  a  hash  reference,  specify the value as a second pair separated by a "=", as in the "pset="
       examples above (escape "=" with a backslash).

       All "--sources" are combined into a hash, and passed to "new" in TAP::Harness's "sources" parameter.

       See TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory for more details on how configuration is passed to <u>SourceHandlers</u>.

</pre><h4><b>PLUGINS</b></h4><pre>
       Plugins can be loaded using the "-P<u>plugin</u>" syntax, eg:

         prove -PMyPlugin

       This will search for a module named "App::Prove::Plugin::MyPlugin", or failing that, "MyPlugin".  If  the
       plugin can't be found, "prove" will complain &amp; exit.

       You can pass arguments to your plugin by appending "=arg1,arg2,etc" to the plugin name:

         prove -PMyPlugin=fou,du,fafa

       Please check individual plugin documentation for more details.
