</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       driftnet - capture images from network traffic and display them in an X window; optionally, capture audio
       streams and play them.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>driftnet</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>filter</u> <u>code</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Driftnet</b>  watches  network  traffic, and picks out and displays JPEG and GIF images for display. It is an
       horrific invasion of privacy and shouldn't be used by anyone  anywhere.  It  has  been  described  as  `a
       graphical  <b><a href="../man8/tcpdump.8.html">tcpdump</a></b>(8)',  `<u>EtherPeg</u> for Unix', and called all sorts of nasty names by people on <u>Freshmeat</u>.
       It is also possible to use <b>driftnet</b> to capture MPEG audio data from the network and  play  it  through  a
       player such as <b><a href="../man1/mpg123.1.html">mpg123</a></b>(1).

       Images may be saved by clicking on them.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Print a summary of usage.

       <b>-v</b>     Print additional details of packets captured to the terminal.

       <b>-b</b>     Beep when a new image is displayed.

       <b>-i</b> <u>interface</u>
              Listen  to  packets  on  <u>interface</u>.  By  default,  <b>driftnet</b>  will  try  to  pick up traffic on all
              interfaces, but this does not work with all versions of <b><a href="../man3/pcap.3.html">pcap</a></b>(3); on  such  systems,  an  interface
              must  be  specified.  On  some  systems, <b>driftnet</b> can only use promiscuous mode if an interface is
              specified.

       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>
              Instead of listening on an interface, read captured packets from a <b><a href="../man3/pcap.3.html">pcap</a></b>(3); dump <u>file</u>; <u>file</u> can be
              a named pipe for use with Kismet or similar.

       <b>-p</b>     Do not put the interface into promiscuous mode.

       <b>-a</b>     Operate in `adjunct mode', where <b>driftnet</b> gathers images for use by another program, such as Jamie
              Zawinski's <b>webcollage</b>. In this mode, no window is displayed; images are captured and  saved  in  a
              temporary directory, and their names written on standard output.

       <b>-m</b> <u>number</u>
              In adjunct mode, silently drop images if there are more than <u>number</u> in the temporary directory. It
              is assumed that another process will delete images which it has processed.

       <b>-x</b> <u>prefix</u>
              The filename prefix to use when saving images, by default `driftnet-'.

       <b>-d</b> <u>directory</u>
              Use  <u>directory</u>  to  store temporary files. <b>Driftnet</b> will clear this directory of its own temporary
              files on exit, but will not delete the directory or any other files.

       <b>-s</b>     Attempt to capture streamed audio data from the network, and either play it or, in  adjunct  mode,
              save it in files. At present this only works with MPEG data.

       <b>-S</b>     Capture streamed audio data only, ignoring images.

       <b>-M</b> <u>command</u>
              Use  the  named  <u>command</u>  to play MPEG audio data. The <u>command</u>, which is executed using the shell,
              should accept MPEG frames on standard input.  The default is `mpg123 -'.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>username</u>
              Drop privileges to user <u>username</u> after starting pcap.

       <b>-l</b>     List the system capture interfaces.

       <b>-r</b>     Put the interface in monitor mode (not supported on all interfaces).

       <b>-g</b>     Enable GTK display (this is the default).

       <b>-w</b>     Enable the HTTP server to display images.

       <b>-W</b>     Port number for the HTTP server (implies -w). Default: 9090.

       <u>filter</u> <u>code</u>
              Additional filter code to restrict the packets captured, in the libpcap syntax. User  filter  code
              is evaluated as `tcp and (<u>filter</u> <u>code</u>)'.
