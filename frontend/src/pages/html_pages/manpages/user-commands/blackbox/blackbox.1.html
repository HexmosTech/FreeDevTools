</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       blackbox - a window manager for X11

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>blackbox</b> -help | -version
       <b>blackbox</b> [ -rc <u>rcfile</u> ] [ -display <u>display</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Blackbox  is  a window manager for the Open Group's X Window System, Version 11 Release 6 and above.  Its
       design is meant to be visually minimalist and fast.

       Blackbox is similar to the NeXT interface and Windowmaker. Applications are launched using a  menu  which
       is accessed by right clicking on the root window. Workspaces, a system of virtual desktops are controlled
       via  a  menu which is accessed by middle clicking on the root window and by using the toolbar. Individual
       windows can be controlled by buttons on the title bar and more options are available by right clicking on
       the title bar.

       Blackbox is able to generate beautiful window decorations on the fly at high speed. Themes, called styles
       in Blackbox terminology, are very flexible but the use  of  pixmaps  has  been  purposefully  avoided  to
       eliminate dependencies and excess memory usage.

       Blackbox  itself  does  not  directly  handle  key bindings like most other window managers. This task is
       handled by a separate utility called bbkeys. Although Blackbox has a built-in workspace (paging)  system,
       bbpager, which provides a graphical pager, is popular with many users.  bbkeys, bbpager and several other
       bbtools can be found by going to
       <b><a href="http://bbtools.thelinuxcommunity.org/">http://bbtools.thelinuxcommunity.org/</a></b>
       The  slit  is  an  edge  of  the screen which can hold specially designed programs called dock apps (from
       Windowmaker). In addition, the popular program gkrellm will also run  in  the  slit.   There  is  a  huge
       selection  of  dockapps  available  and they run the gamut from must-have gadgets to utterly useless (but
       cute and/or funny) eye candy.
       <b><a href="http://www.bensinclair.com/dockapp/">http://www.bensinclair.com/dockapp/</a></b>
       <b><a href="http://dockapps.org/">http://dockapps.org/</a></b>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Blackbox supports the following command line options:

       <b>-help</b>  Display command line options, compiled-in features, and exit.

       <b>-version</b>
              Display version and exit.

       <b>-rc</b> <u>rcfile</u>
              Use an alternate resource file.

       <b>-display</b> <u>display</u>
              Start Blackbox on the specified display, and set the <b>DISPLAY</b> environment variable  to  this  value
              for programs started by Blackbox.

</pre><h4><b>STARTING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>EXITING</b> <b>BLACKBOX</b></h4><pre>
       The  most  common  method for starting Blackbox is to place the the command "blackbox" (no quotes) at the
       end of your <b><a href="file:~/.xinitrc">~/.xinitrc</a></b> or <b><a href="file:~/.xsession">~/.xsession</a></b> file.  The advantage of putting Blackbox at the end of the file  is
       that  the  X  Server  will shutdown when you exit Blackbox. Blackbox can also be started from the command
       line of a terminal program like xterm in an X session  that  does  not  already  have  a  window  manager
       running.

       On startup, Blackbox will look for <b><a href="file:~/.blackboxrc">~/.blackboxrc</a></b> and use the resource <b>session.menuFile</b> to determine where
       to get the menu for the session.  If this file is not found Blackbox will use <b>/etc/X11/blackbox/blackbox-</b>
       <b>menu</b>  as  the menu file. If that fails as well Blackbox will use a default menu that contains commands to
       start an xterm as well as restart and exit the window manager.  The  other  resources  available  in  the
       <b><a href="file:~/.blackboxrc">~/.blackboxrc</a></b> file are discussed later in this manual under the heading RESOURCE FILE.

       On exit, Blackbox writes its current configuration to <b><a href="file:~/.blackboxrc.">~/.blackboxrc.</a></b>
       <b>NOTE:</b>
       If <a href="file:~/.blackboxrc">~/.blackboxrc</a> is modified during a Blackbox
       session, Blackbox must be restarted with the
       "restart" command on the main menu or the changes
       will be lost on exit. Restart causes Blackbox to
       re-read <a href="file:~/.blackboxrc">~/.blackboxrc</a> and apply the changes immediately.
       Blackbox can be exited by selecting "exit" on the main menu (discussed shortly), killing it gently from a
       terminal or by the X Window System shutdown hot key combo Ctrl+Alt+BackSpace.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>BLACKBOX</b></h4><pre>
       A three button mouse has the following functions when clicking on the root window:

       <b>Button</b> <b>Two</b>  (Middle Button)
              Open workspace menu

       <b>Button</b> <b>Three</b>  (Right Button)
              Open main menu

       Note that Button One (Left Button) is not used.

       <b>Main</b> <b>Menu</b>
              The  default  installation  assumes  you have a number of common X Window System programs in their
              typical locations. The default menu is defined by a plain text file named 'menu'.  It  is  heavily
              commented  and  covers  a  number  of  details  of  menu file syntax. This file can also be edited
              graphically by using the extension program bbconf which makes menu creation very easy.  Menu  file
              syntax is discussed later in this manual.
              <b>Caveat:</b>
              Menus can run arbitrary command lines, but
              if you wish to use a complex command line
              it is best to place it in a shell script.
              Remember to put #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> on the first
              line and chmod 755 on the file to make it
              executable.

       <b>Workspace</b> <b>Menu</b>
              This  menu  gives  the  user control of the workspace system. The user can create a new workspace,
              remove the last workspace or go to an application via either the icon menu or a  workspace  entry.
              Workspaces are listed by name. Clicking on the workspace name will take you to that workspace with
              focus on the program under the mouse. If there are programs already running in the workspace, they
              will  appear  in  a pop-out menu.  Clicking on the application name will jump to the workspace and
              focus that application. If a middle click is used the  window  will  be  brought  to  the  current
              workspace.

              Blackbox  uses  an external program, bbpager, to provide a traditional, graphical paging interface
              to the workspace system. Many Blackbox users run another extension program - bbkeys -  to  provide
              keyboard shortcuts for workspace control.
              <b>Caveat:</b>
              To name a workspace the user must right
              click on the toolbar, select "Edit current
              workspace name," type the workspace name,
              And_Press_Enter to finish.
              Workspaces can also be named in the .blackboxrc file as described in RESOURCES.

       <b>The</b> <b>Slit</b>
              The  Slit  provides  a user positionable window for running utility programs called "dockapps". To
              learn more about  dockapps  refer  to  the  web  sites  mentioned  in  the  Description.  Dockapps
              automatically  run in the slit in most cases, but may require a special command switch.  Often, -w
              is used for "withdrawn" into the slit.

              gkrellm is a very useful and modern dockapp that gives the user  near  real  time  information  on
              machine  performance.  Other  dockapps  include clocks, notepads, pagers, key grabbers, fishbowls,
              fire places and many, many others.

              Only mouse button three is captured by the Blackbox slit. This menu allows the user to change  the
              position  of  the  slit, and sets the state of Always on top, and Auto hide. These all do what the
              user expects.

              <b>Caveat:</b>
              When starting Dockapps from an external script
              a race condition can take place where the shell
              rapidly forks all of the dockapps, which then
              take varied and random times to draw themselves
              for the first time. To get the dockapps to start
              in a given order, follow each dockapp with
              sleep 2; This ensures that each dockapp is placed
              in the correct order by the slit.
              <b>i.e.</b>
              #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
              speyes -w &amp; sleep 2
              gkrellm -w &amp; sleep 2

       <b>The</b> <b>Toolbar</b>
              The toolbar provides an alternate method for cycling through multiple workspaces and applications.
              The left side of the toolbar is the workspace control, the center is the application control,  and
              the right side is a clock. The format of the clock can be controlled as described under RESOURCES.

              Mouse button 3 raises a menu that allows configuration of the toolbar. It can be positioned either
              at the top or the bottom of the screen and can be set to auto hide and/or to always be on top.

              <b>Caveat:</b>
              The toolbar is a permanent fixture. It
              can only be removed by modifying the source and
              rebuilding, which is beyond the scope of this
              document. Setting the toolbar to auto hide is
              the next best thing.

       <b>Window</b> <b>Decorations</b>
              Window  decorations  include  handles at the bottom of each window, a title bar, and three control
              buttons.  The handles at the bottom of the window are divided into three sections.  The two corner
              sections are resizing handles The center section is a window  moving  handle.  The  bottom  center
              handle  and  the title bar respond to a number of mouse clicks and key + mouse click combinations.
              The three buttons in the title bar, left to right, are iconify, maximize, and  close.  The  resize
              button has special behavior detailed below.

       <b>Button</b> <b>One</b>  (Left Button)
              Click  and  drag  on  titlebar to move or resize from bottom corners.  Click the iconify button to
              move the window to the icon list.  Click the maximize button to fully maximize the window.   Click
              the  close  button  to  close the window and application.  Double-Click the title bar to shade the
              window.

       <b>Alt</b> <b>+</b> <b>Button</b> <b>One</b>
              Click anywhere on client window and drag to move the window.

       <b>Button</b> <b>Two</b>  (Middle Button)
              Click the titlebar to lower the  window.   Click  the  maximize  button  to  maximize  the  window
              vertically.

       <b>Button</b> <b>Three</b>  (Right Button)
              Click  on  title bar or bottom center handle pulls down a control menu.  Click the maximize button
              to maximize the window horizontally.

       <b>Alt</b> <b>+</b> <b>Button</b> <b>Three</b>
              Click anywhere on client window and drag to resize the window.

       <b>The</b> <b>control</b> <b>menu</b> <b>contains:</b>

       <b>Send</b> <b>To</b> <b>...</b>
              <b>Button</b> <b>One</b>  (Left Button)
              Click to send this window to another workspace.
              <b>Button</b> <b>Two</b>  (Middle Button)
              Click to send this window to another workspace, change
              to that workspace and keep the application focused.
              as well.

       <b>Shade</b>  This is the same action as Double-Click with Button One.

       <b>Iconify</b>
              Hide the window.  It can be accessed with the icon menu.

       <b>Maximize</b>
              Toggle window maximization.

       <b>Raise</b>  Bring window to the front above the other windows and
              focus it.

       <b>Lower</b>  Drop the window below the other ones.

       <b>Stick</b>  Stick this window to the glass on the inside of
              the monitor so it does not hide when you change
              workspaces.

       <b>Kill</b> <b>Client</b>
              This kills the client program with -SIGKILL (-9)
              Only use this as a last resort.

       <b>Close</b>  Send a close signal to the client application.

</pre><h4><b>STYLES</b></h4><pre>
       Styles are a collection of colors, fonts, and textures that control the  appearance  of  Blackbox.  These
       characteristics   are   recorded  in  style  files.  The  default  system  style  files  are  located  in
       <u>/usr/share/blackbox/styles.</u>  The menu system will identify the style by its filename, and styles  can  be
       sorted into different directories at the user's discretion.

       There are over 700 styles available for Blackbox. The official distribution point for Blackbox styles is

       <b><a href="http://blackbox.themes.org/">http://blackbox.themes.org/</a></b>

       All themes should install by simply downloading them to <b><a href="file:~/.blackbox/">~/.blackbox/</a></b> then unzip it, and de-tar it.

       On open Unixes this will be:

       <b>tar</b> <b>zxvf</b> <b>stylename.tar.gz</b>

       On commercial Unixes this will be something like:

       <b>gunzip</b> <b>stylename.tar.gz</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>tar</b> <b>xvf</b> <b>stylename.tar</b>

       Check your system manuals for specifics or check with your network administrator.

       An entry should appear in the styles menu immediately.
       <b>Security</b> <b>Warning</b>
       Style files can execute shell scripts and other
       executables. It would is wise to check the
       rootCommand in the style file and make sure that
       it is benign.

       <b>Things</b> <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong.</b>

       1. The theme is pre Blackbox 0.51.
              Style file syntax changed with version 0.51

       2. The style tarball was formatted incorrectly.
              Some styles use the directories <b><a href="file:~/.blackbox/Backgrounds">~/.blackbox/Backgrounds</a></b> and <b><a href="file:~/.blackbox/Styles">~/.blackbox/Styles</a></b>

              This  can  fixed  by adding a <b>[stylemenu]</b> <b>(<a href="file:~/.blackbox/Styles">~/.blackbox/Styles</a>)</b> to your menu file. To be a complete
              purist, hack the style file with the correct paths and move the files into the correct directories

       3. The rootCommmand line is broken.
              The rootCommand line in the style file will run an arbitrary executable. It is important that this
              executable be set to bsetbg to  maintain  portability  between  systems  with  different  graphics
              software. In addition bsetbg can execute a shell script and do it in a portable fashion as well.

       <b>The</b> <b>documented</b> <b>method</b> <b>for</b> <b>creating</b> <b>styles</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows:</b>

       1. Create or acquire the background for the style if
              it will not be using <b>bsetroot</b> to draw a patterned background for the root window.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
              Blackbox runs on a wide variety
              of systems ranging from PCs with 640x480 256 color
              displays to ultra high speed workstations with 25"
              screens and extreme resolution. For best results a
              style graphic should be at least 1024x768.

       2. Create a style file.
              The best way to do this is to make a copy of a similar style and then edit it.

              The style file is a list of X resources and other external variables. Manipulating these variables
              allows  users  to  completely change the appearance of Blackbox. The user can also change the root
              window image by using the wrapper program <b>bsetbg.</b>

              bsetbg knows how to use a number of programs to set the root window image. This makes styles  much
              more  portable  since various platforms have different graphics software. For more info see <b>bsetbg</b>
              <b>(1).</b>

       3. Background images should be placed in
              <b><a href="file:~/.blackbox/backgrounds">~/.blackbox/backgrounds</a></b>  The  style  file  should  be  placed  in  <b><a href="file:~/.blackbox/styles">~/.blackbox/styles</a></b>  any   other
              information about the style should be placed in <b><a href="file:~/.blackbox/about/STYLE_NAME/.">~/.blackbox/about/STYLE_NAME/.</a></b>  This would include
              README files, licenses, etc.

              Previous versions of Blackbox put backgrounds and styles in different directories. The directories
              listed above are the only officially supported directories.  However you may put them wherever you
              like as long as you update your menu file so it knows where to find your styles.

       4. To create a consistent experience and to ensure
              portability  between  all systems it is important to use the following format to create your style
              archive.

              first create a new directory named after your style <b>NEW_STYLE</b>

              In this directory create the directories
              <b>backgrounds</b>
              <b>styles</b>
              <b>about/NEW_STYLE</b>
              Next put everything for the theme in these locations. Finally type

              tar cvzf NEW_STYLE.tar.gz *

              If you are using commercial Unix you may need to use gzip and tar separately.

              Now when a user downloads a new style file she knows that all she has to do is put the tarball  in
              her Blackbox directory, unzip-&gt;un-tar it and then click on it in her style menu.

       <b>Style</b> <b>File</b> <b>Syntax</b> <b>and</b> <b>Details</b>

              By  far  the easiest way to create a new style is to use bbconf. bbconf allows complete control of
              every facet of style files and gives immediate updates of the current style as changes are made.

              The style file format is not currently documented in a man  page.   There  is  a  readme  document
              included with the Blackbox source containing this information.

</pre><h4><b>MENU</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The  default menu file is installed in <b>/etc/X11/blackbox/blackbox-menu.</b>  This menu can be customized as a
       system default menu or the user can create a personal menu.

       To create a personal menu copy  the  default  menu  to  a  file  in  your  home  directory.   Then,  open
       <b><a href="file:~/.blackboxrc">~/.blackboxrc</a></b> and add or modify the resource <b>session.menuFile:</b>  <u><a href="file:~/.blackbox/menu">~/.blackbox/menu</a></u>

       Next,  edit the new menu file. This can be done during a Blackbox session and the menu will automatically
       be updated when the code checks for file changes.

       The default menu included with Blackbox has numerous comments describing the use of  all  menu  commands.
       Menu commands follow this general form:

       <b>[command]</b>  <u>(label|filename)</u> <u>{shell</u> <u>command|filename}</u>

       <b>Blackbox</b> <b>menu</b> <b>commands:</b>

          <b>#</b>    <u>string...</u>
              Hash  (or  pound  or  number sign) is used as the comment delimiter. It can be used as a full line
              comment or as an end of line comment after a valid command statement.

       <b>[begin]</b>  <u>(string)</u>
              This tag is used only once at the beginning of the menu file. "string" is the name or  description
              used at the top of the menu.

       <b>[end]</b>
              This tag is used at the end of the menu file and at the end of a submenu block.

       <b>[exec]</b>  <u>(label</u> <u>string)</u> <u>{command</u> <u>string}</u>
              This is a very flexible tag that allows the user to run an arbitrary shell command including shell
              scripts.  If  a command is too large to type on the command line by hand it is best to put it in a
              shell script.

       <b>[nop]</b>  <u>(label</u> <u>string)</u>
              This tag is used to put a divider in the menu.  <u>label</u> <u>string</u> is an optional description.

       <b>[submenu]</b>  <u>(submenu</u> <u>name)</u> <u>{title</u> <u>string}</u>
              This creates a sub-menu with the name <u>submenu</u> <u>name</u> and if given, the string <u>title</u> <u>string</u>  will  be
              the title of the pop up menu itself.

       <b>[include]</b>  <u>(filename)</u>
              This  command  inserts  <u>filename</u>  into the menu file at the point at which it is called.  <u>filename</u>
              should not contain a begin end pair. This feature can be  used  to  include  the  system  menu  or
              include a piece of menu that is updated by a separate program.

       <b>[stylesdir]</b>  <u>(description)</u> <u>(path)</u>
              Causes  Blackbox  to  search <u>path</u> for style files. Blackbox lists styles in the menu by their file
              name as returned by the OS.

       <b>[stylesmenu]</b>  <u>(description)</u> <u>{path}</u>
              This command creates a submenu with the name <b>description</b> with the contents of <b>path.</b>  By creating a
              submenu and then populating it with stylesmenu entries the user can create an organized library of
              styles.

       <b>[workspaces]</b>  <u>(description)</u>
              Inserts a link into the main menu to the workspace menu.  If  used,  <u>description</u>  is  an  optional
              description.

       <b>[config]</b>  <u>(label)</u>
              This  command  causes  Blackbox  to  insert  a menu that gives the user control over focus models,
              dithering and other system preferences.

       <b>[reconfig]</b>  <u>(label)</u> <u>{shell</u> <u>command}</u>
              The reconfig command causes Blackbox to reread its configuration  files.  This  does  not  include
              <b><a href="file:~/.blackboxrc">~/.blackboxrc</a></b>  which  is  only  reread  when  Blackbox  is restarted. If <u>shell</u> <u>command</u> is included
              Blackbox will run this command or shell script before rereading the files. This  can  be  used  to
              switch between multiple configurations

       <b>[restart]</b>  <u>(label)</u> <u>{shell</u> <u>command}</u>
              This  command  is actually an exit command that defaults to restarting Blackbox. If provided <b>shell</b>
              <b>command</b> is run instead of Blackbox. This can be used to change versions of Blackbox. Not that  you
              would ever want to do this but, it could also be used to start a different window manager.

       <b>[exit]</b>  <u>(label)</u>
              Shuts  down  Blackbox.  If  Blackbox is the last command in your <b><a href="file:~/.xinitrc">~/.xinitrc</a></b> file, this action will
              also shutdown X.
              <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> <b>file:</b>

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCE</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$HOME</b><u>/.blackboxrc</u> These options are stored in the <a href="file:~/.blackboxrc">~/.blackboxrc</a> file.  They control various  features  of
       Blackbox and most can be set from menus. Some of these can only be set by editing .blackboxrc directly.

       NOTE:  Blackbox  only  reads  this  file  during  start up. To make changes take effect during a Blackbox
       session the user must choose "restart" on the main menu.  If you do not do so, your changes will be  lost
       when Blackbox exits.

       Some resources are named with a &lt;num&gt; after screen. This should be replaced with the number of the screen
       that is being configured. The default is 0 (zero).

       <u>Menu</u> <u>Configurable</u>  <b>(Slit</b> <b>Menu):</b>
          Right click (button 3) on the slit border.

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.slit.placement</b>  <u>SEE</u> <u>BELOW</u>
          Determines  the  position of the slit.  Certain combinations of slit.placement with slit.direction are
          not terribly useful, i.e. TopCenter with Vertical direction puts the slit through the middle  of  your
          screen. Certainly some will think that is cool if only to be different...
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>CenterLeft.</b>
          [  TopLeft  |   TopCenter  |   TopRight  |
           CenterLeft |              | CenterRight |
           BottomLeft | BottomCenter | BottomRight ]

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.slit.direction</b>  <u>[Horizontal|Vertical]</u>
          Determines the direction of the slit.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>Vertical.</b>

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.slit.onTop</b>  <u>[True|False]</u>
          Determines whether the slit is always visible over windows or if the focused window can hide the slit.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>True.</b>

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.slit.autoHide</b>  <u>[True|False]</u>
          Determines  whether  the  slit  hides when not in use.  The session.autoRaiseDelay time determines how
          long you must hover to get the slit to raise and how long it stays visible after mouse out.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>False.</b>

       <u>Menu</u> <u>Configurable</u>  <b>(Main</b> <b>Menu):</b>

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.focusModel</b>  <u>SEE</u> <u>BELOW</u>
          Sloppy focus (mouse focus) is the conventional X Window behavior and can be modified with AutoRaise or
          Click-Raise.

          AutoRaise causes the window to automatically raise after session.autoRaiseDelay milliseconds.

          ClickRaise causes the window to raise if you click anywhere inside the client area of the window.

          Sloppy focus alone requires a click on the titlebar, border or lower grip to raise the window.

          ClickToFocus requires a click on a Blackbox decoration or in the client area to focus  and  raise  the
          window.  ClickToFocus cannot be modified by AutoRaise or ClickRaise.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>SloppyFocus</b>
          [SloppyFocus [[AutoRaise &amp; ClickRaise]  |
                        [AutoRaise | ClickRaise]] |
          ClickToFocus]

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.windowPlacement</b>  <u>SEE</u> <u>BELOW</u>
          RowSmartPlacement  tries  to  fit  new  windows  in  empty space by making rows.  Direction depends on
          session.screen&lt;num&gt;.rowPlacementDirection

          ColSmartPlacement tries to fit new windows in empty space  by  making  columns  Direction  depends  on
          session.screen&lt;num&gt;.colPlacementDirection

          CascadePlacement places the new window down and to the right of the most recently created window.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>RowSmartPlacement.</b>
          [RowSmartPlacement | ColSmartPlacement | CascadePlacement]

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.rowPlacementDirection</b>  <u>[LeftToRight|RightToLeft]</u>
          Determines placement direction for new windows.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>LeftToRight.</b>

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.colPlacementDirection</b>  <u>[TopToBottom|BottomToTop]</u>
          Determines placement direction for new windows.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>TopToBottom.</b>

       <b>session.imageDither</b>  <u>[True|False]</u>
          This  setting is only used when running in low color modes. Image Dithering helps one to show an image
          properly even if there are not enough colors available in the system.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>False.</b>

       <b>session.opaqueMove</b>  <u>[True|False]</u>
          Determines whether the window's contents are drawn as it is moved.  When False the behavior is to draw
          a box representing the window.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>False.</b>

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.fullMaximization</b>  <u>[True|False]</u>
          Determines if the maximize button will cause an application to maximize over the slit and toolbar.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>False.</b>

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.focusNewWindows</b>  <u>[True|False]</u>
          Determines if newly created windows are given focus after they initially draw themselves.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>False.</b>

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.focusLastWindow</b>  <u>[True|False]</u>
          This is actually "when moving between workspaces, remember which  window  has  focus  when  leaving  a
          workspace and return the focus to that window when I return to that workspace."
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>False.</b>

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.disableBindingsWithScrollLock</b>  <u>[True|False]</u>
          When  this  resource  is enabled, turning on scroll lock keeps Blackbox from grabbing the Alt and Ctrl
          keys that it normally uses for mouse controls. This feature  allows  users  of  drawing  and  modeling
          programs  which use keystrokes to modify mouse actions to maintain their sanity.  *NOTE* this has _no_
          affect on bbkeys.  If you need bbkeys to also behave this way it has a similar option  in  its  config
          file.  Refer to the bbkeys manpage for details.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>False.</b>

       <u>Menu</u> <u>Configurable</u>  <b>(Workspace</b> <b>Menu):</b>
          Middle click (button 2) on the root window (AKA Desktop) to reach this menu

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.workspaces</b>  <u>[integer]</u>
          Workspaces may be created or deleted by middle clicking on the desktop and choosing "New Workspace" or
          "Remove Last". After creating a workspace, right click on the toolbar to name it.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>1</b>

       <u>Menu</u> <u>Configurable</u>  <b>(Toolbar</b> <b>Menu):</b>

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.workspaceNames</b>  <u>[string[,</u> <u>string...]]</u>
          Workspaces  are named in the order specified in this resource. Names should be delimited by commas. If
          there are more workspaces than explicit  names,  un-named  workspaces  will  be  named  as  "Workspace
          [number]".
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b>
          Workspace 1.

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.toolbar.placement</b>  <u>SEE</u> <u>BELOW</u>
          Set toolbar screen position.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>BottomCenter</b>
          [  TopLeft  |   TopCenter  |   TopRight  |
           BottomLeft | BottomCenter | BottomRight ]

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.toolbar.onTop</b>  <u>[True|False]</u>
          Determines  whether  the  toolbar is always visible over windows or if the focused window can hide the
          toolbar.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>True.</b>

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.toolbar.autoHide</b>  <u>[True|False]</u>
          Determines whether the toolbar hides when not in use.  The session.autoRaiseDelay time determines  how
          long you must hover to get the toolbar to raise, and how long it stays visible after mouse out.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>False.</b>

       <u>Configurable</u> <u>in</u>  <b><a href="file:~/.Blackboxrc">~/.Blackboxrc</a></b> <b>only:</b>

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.toolbar.widthPercent</b>  <u>[1-100]</u>
          Percentage  of screen used by the toolbar.  A number from 1-100 that sets the width of the toolbar.  0
          (zero) does not cause the toolbar to disappear, instead the toolbar is set to the default. If you want
          to lose the toolbar there are patches that can remove it.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>66.</b>

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.strftimeFormat</b>  <u>[string]</u>
          A C language date format string, any combination of specifiers can be used. The default  is  %I:%M  %p
          which generates a 12 hour clock with minutes and an am/pm indicator appropriate to the locale.
          <u>24</u> <u>hours</u> <u>and</u> <u>minutes</u>    <b>%H:%M</b>
          <u>12</u> <u>hours</u> <u>and</u> <u>minute</u>     <b>%I:%M</b> <b>%p</b>
          <u>month/day/year</u>          <b>%m/%d/%y</b>
          <u>day/month/year</u>          <b>%d/%m/%y</b>
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>hours:minutes</b> <b>am/pm</b>
          See
          <b>strftime</b> <b>3</b>
          for more details.

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.dateFormat</b>  <u>[American|European]</u>
          NOTE: Only used if the strftime() function is not available on  your system.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>American,</b> <b>(mon/day/year).</b>

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.clockFormat</b>  <u>[12/24]</u>
          <b>NOTE:</b> Only used if the strftime() function is not available on your system.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>12-hour</b> <b>format.</b>

       <b>session.screen&lt;num&gt;.edgeSnapThreshold</b>  <u>[integer]</u>
          When  set to 0 this turns off edge snap. When set to one or greater edge snap will cause a window that
          is being moved to snap to the nearest screen edge, the slit, or or the toolbar. Windows will not  snap
          to each other.  The value represents a number in pixels which is the distance between the window and a
          screen  edge  which  is  required before the window is snapped to the screen edge.  If you prefer this
          functionality values between 6 - 10 work nicely.
          <b>Default</b> <b>value</b> <b>is</b> <b>0</b>

       <b>session.menuFile</b>  <u>[filepath]</u>
          Full path to the current menu file.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>/etc/X11/blackbox/blackbox-menu</b>

       <b>session.colorsPerChannel</b>  <u>[2-6]</u>
          The number of colors taken from the X server for use on pseudo color displays. This value must be  set
          to 4 for 8 bit displays.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>4.</b>

       <b>session.doubleClickInterval</b>  <u>[integer]</u>
          This  is  the  maximum time that Blackbox will wait after one click to catch a double click. This only
          applies to Blackbox actions, such as double click shading, not to the X server in general.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>250</b> <b>milliseconds.</b>

       <b>session.autoRaiseDelay</b>  <u>[integer]</u>
          This is the time in milliseconds used for auto raise and auto hide behaviors. More than about 1000  ms
          is likely useless.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>250</b> <b>millisecond.</b>

       <b>session.cacheLife</b>  <u>[integer]</u>
          Determines the maximum number of minutes that the X server will cache unused decorations.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>5</b> <b>minutes</b>

       <b>session.cacheMax</b>  <u>[integer]</u>
          Determines  how  many  kilobytes  that  Blackbox  may  take from the X server for storing decorations.
          Increasing this number may enhance your performance if you have plenty  of  memory  and  use  lots  of
          different windows.
          <b>Default</b> <b>is</b> <b>200</b> <b>Kilobytes</b>

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>

              style directories.

       <b>DISPLAY</b>
              If a display is not specified on the command line, Blackbox will use the value of $DISPLAY.

       <b>Sean</b>  <b>Shaleh</b>  <b>Perry</b>   <u>&lt;<a href="mailto:shaleh@debian.org">shaleh@debian.org</a>&gt;</u> is the current maintainer and is actively working together with
       Brad to keep Blackbox up-to-date and stable as a rock.

       <b>Brad</b> <b>Hughes</b>  <u>&lt;<a href="mailto:bhughes@trolltech.com">bhughes@trolltech.com</a>&gt;</u> originally designed and coded Blackbox in 1997 with  the  intent  of
       creating  a  memory efficient window manager with no dependencies on external libraries.  Brad's original
       idea has become a popular alternative to other window managers.

       <b>Jeff</b> <b>Raven</b>  <u>&lt;<a href="mailto:jraven@psu.edu">jraven@psu.edu</a>&gt;</u> then picked up the torch for the 0.61.x series after Brad took a  full  time
       job at TrollTech.
