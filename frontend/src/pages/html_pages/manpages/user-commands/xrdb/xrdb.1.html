</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xrdb - X server resource database utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xrdb</b> [-option ...] [<u>filename</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xrdb</u>  is used to get or set the contents of the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of screen 0,
       or the SCREEN_RESOURCES property on the root window of any or all screens, or everything  combined.   You
       would normally run this program from your X startup file.

       Most  X  clients  use  the RESOURCE_MANAGER and SCREEN_RESOURCES properties to get user preferences about
       color, fonts, and so on for applications.  Having this information in the server (where it  is  available
       to  all  clients)  instead  of on disk, solves the problem in previous versions of X that required you to
       maintain <u>defaults</u> files on every machine that you might use.  It also  allows  for  dynamic  changing  of
       defaults without editing files.

       The  RESOURCE_MANAGER  property  is  used  for  resources  that apply to all screens of the display.  The
       SCREEN_RESOURCES property on each screen specifies additional (or overriding) resources to  be  used  for
       that  screen.   (When  there is only one screen, SCREEN_RESOURCES is normally not used, all resources are
       just placed in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.)

       The file specified by <u>filename</u> (or the contents from standard input if - or  no  filename  is  given)  is
       optionally  passed  through  the  C  preprocessor  with  the  following  symbols  defined,  based  on the
       capabilities of the server being used:

       <b>SERVERHOST=</b><u>hostname</u>
               the hostname portion of the display to which you are connected.

       <b>SRVR_</b><u>name</u>
               the SERVERHOST hostname string turned into a legal identifier.  For example, "my-dpy.lcs.mit.edu"
               becomes SRVR_my_dpy_lcs_mit_edu.

       <b>HOST=</b><u>hostname</u>
               the same as <b>SERVERHOST</b>.

       <b>DISPLAY_NUM=</b><u>num</u>
               the number of the display on the server host.

       <b>CLIENTHOST=</b><u>hostname</u>
               the name of the host on which <u>xrdb</u> is running.

       <b>CLNT_</b><u>name</u>
               the CLIENTHOST hostname string turned into a legal identifier.  For  example,  "expo.lcs.mit.edu"
               becomes CLNT_expo_lcs_mit_edu.

       <b>RELEASE=</b><u>num</u>
               the  vendor release number for the server.  The interpretation of this number will vary depending
               on VENDOR.

       <b>REVISION=</b><u>num</u>
               the X protocol minor version supported by this server (currently 0).

       <b>VERSION=</b><u>num</u>
               the X protocol major version supported by this server (should always be 11).

       <b>VENDOR="</b><u>vendor</u><b>"</b>
               a string literal specifying the vendor of the server.

       <b>VNDR_</b><u>name</u>
               the VENDOR name string turned into a legal identifier.  For example, "MIT X  Consortium"  becomes
               VNDR_MIT_X_Consortium.

       <b>EXT_</b><u>name</u>
               A  symbol  is defined for each protocol extension supported by the server.  Each extension string
               name is turned into a legal identifier.  For example, "X3D-PEX" becomes EXT_X3D_PEX.

       <b>NUM_SCREENS=</b><u>num</u>
               the total number of screens.

       <b>SCREEN_NUM=</b><u>num</u>
               the number of the current screen (from zero).

       <b>BITS_PER_RGB=</b><u>num</u>
               the number of significant bits in an RGB color specification.  This is the  log  base  2  of  the
               number  of  distinct shades of each primary that the hardware can generate.  Note that it usually
               is not related to PLANES.

       <b>CLASS=</b><u>visualclass</u>
               one of StaticGray, GrayScale, StaticColor, PseudoColor,  TrueColor,  DirectColor.   This  is  the
               visual class of the root window.

       <b>CLASS_</b><u>visualclass</u><b>=</b><u>visualid</u>
               the  visual class of the root window in a form you can <u>#ifdef</u> on.  The value is the numeric id of
               the visual.

       <b>COLOR</b>   defined only if CLASS is one of StaticColor, PseudoColor, TrueColor, or DirectColor.

       <b>CLASS_</b><u>visualclass_depth</u><b>=</b><u>num</u>
               A symbol is defined for each visual supported for the screen.  The symbol includes the  class  of
               the  visual  and  its depth; the value is the numeric id of the visual.  (If more than one visual
               has the same class and depth, the numeric id of the first one reported by the server is used.)

       <b>HEIGHT=</b><u>num</u>
               the height of the root window in pixels.

       <b>WIDTH=</b><u>num</u>
               the width of the root window in pixels.

       <b>PLANES=</b><u>num</u>
               the number of bit planes (the depth) of the root window.

       <b>X_RESOLUTION=</b><u>num</u>
               the x resolution of the screen in pixels per meter.

       <b>Y_RESOLUTION=</b><u>num</u>
               the y resolution of the screen in pixels per meter.

       SRVR_<u>name</u>, CLNT_<u>name</u>, VNDR_<u>name</u>, and EXT_<u>name</u> identifiers are formed by  changing  all  characters  other
       than letters and digits into underscores (_).

       Lines that begin with an exclamation mark (!) are ignored and may be used as comments.

       Note  that  since  <u>xrdb</u>  can  read  from  standard  input,  it  can be used to the change the contents of
       properties directly from a terminal or from a shell script.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xrdb</u> program accepts the following options:

       <b>-help</b>   This option (or any unsupported option) will cause a brief description of the  allowable  options
               and parameters to be printed.

       <b>-version</b>
               This  option will cause the xrdb version to be printed and the program to exit without performing
               any other operations.

       <b>-display</b> <u>display</u>
               This option specifies the X server to be used; see <u><a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a>(7)</u>.  It also specifies the screen to use for
               the <u>-screen</u> option, and it specifies the screen from which preprocessor symbols are  derived  for
               the <u>-global</u> option.

       <b>-all</b>    This  option  indicates  that  operation  should  be performed on the screen-independent resource
               property (RESOURCE_MANAGER), as well as the screen-specific property (SCREEN_RESOURCES) on  every
               screen  of  the  display.  For example, when used in conjunction with <u>-query</u>, the contents of all
               properties are output.  For <u>-load</u>, <u>-override</u> and <u>-merge</u>, the input file  is  processed  once  for
               each  screen.   The resources which occur in common in the output for every screen are collected,
               and these are applied as the screen-independent resources.  The remaining resources  are  applied
               for each individual per-screen property.  This the default mode of operation.

       <b>-global</b> This  option  indicates  that  the  operation  should only be performed on the screen-independent
               RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

       <b>-screen</b> This option indicates that the  operation  should  only  be  performed  on  the  SCREEN_RESOURCES
               property of the default screen of the display.

       <b>-screens</b>
               This  option indicates that the operation should be performed on the SCREEN_RESOURCES property of
               each screen of the display.  For <u>-load</u>, <u>-override</u> and <u>-merge</u>, the input  file  is  processed  for
               each screen.

       <b>-n</b>      This  option  indicates that changes to the specified properties (when used with <u>-load</u>, <u>-override</u>
               or <u>-merge</u>) or to the resource file (when used with <u>-edit</u>) should be shown on the standard output,
               but should not be performed.

       <b>-quiet</b>  This option indicates that warning about duplicate entries should not be displayed.

       <b>-cpp</b> <u>filename</u>
               This option specifies the pathname of the C preprocessor program to be used.  Although  <u>xrdb</u>  was
               designed to use CPP, any program that acts as a filter and accepts the -D, -I, and -U options may
               be used.

       <b>-nocpp</b>  This  option  indicates  that  <u>xrdb</u>  should  not run the input file through a preprocessor before
               loading it into properties.

       <b>-undef</b>  This option is passed to the C preprocessor if used. It prevents it from predefining  any  system
               specific macros.

       <b>-E</b>      This option indicates that any cpp command run and the output from it should be shown on standard
               output.   If  <b>-nocpp</b>  was  also  specified,  the input file will be shown as read.  The specified
               changes will also be performed unless the <b>-n</b> option is also specified.

       <b>-symbols</b>
               This option indicates that the symbols that are defined for the preprocessor  should  be  printed
               onto the standard output.

       <b>-query</b>  This  option  indicates  that  the current contents of the specified properties should be printed
               onto the standard output.  Note that since preprocessor commands in the input resource  file  are
               part  of  the  input  file,  not  part of the property, they won't appear in the output from this
               option.  The <b>-edit</b> option can be used to merge the contents of properties  back  into  the  input
               resource file without damaging preprocessor commands.

       <b>-get</b> <u>name</u>
               This  option  indicates  that the current content of the property matching <u>name</u> should be printed
               onto the standard output.

       <b>-load</b>   This option indicates that the input  should  be  loaded  as  the  new  value  of  the  specified
               properties,  replacing  whatever  was  there  (i.e.   the old contents are removed).  This is the
               default action.

       <b>-override</b>
               This option indicates that the input should be  added  to,  instead  of  replacing,  the  current
               contents of the specified properties.  New entries override previous entries.

       <b>-merge</b>  This  option indicates that the input should be merged and lexicographically sorted with, instead
               of replacing, the current contents of the specified properties.

       <b>-remove</b> This option indicates that the specified properties should be removed from the server.

       <b>-retain</b> This option indicates that the server should be instructed not to reset  if  <u>xrdb</u>  is  the  first
               client.   This  should never be necessary under normal conditions, since <u>xdm</u> and <u>xinit</u> always act
               as the first client.

       <b>-edit</b> <u>filename</u>
               This option indicates that the contents of the specified properties should  be  edited  into  the
               given  file,  replacing any values already listed there.  This allows you to put changes that you
               have made to your defaults back into your resource file, preserving any comments or  preprocessor
               lines.

       <b>-backup</b> <u>string</u>
               This  option  specifies  a  suffix  to  be appended to the filename used with <b>-edit</b> to generate a
               backup file.

       <b>-D</b><u>name[=value]</u>
               This option is passed through to the preprocessor and is used to  define  symbols  for  use  with
               conditionals such as <u>#ifdef.</u>

       <b>-U</b><u>name</u>  This  option  is passed through to the preprocessor and is used to remove any definitions of this
               symbol.

       <b>-I</b><u>directory</u>
               This option is passed through to the preprocessor and is used to specify a  directory  to  search
               for files that are referenced with <u>#include.</u>

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xrdb</u>  does  not  load  any files on its own, but many desktop environments use xrdb to load <u><a href="file:~/.Xresources">~/.Xresources</a></u>
       files on session  startup  to  initialize  the  resource  database,  as  a  generalized  replacement  for
       <u><a href="file:~/.Xdefaults">~/.Xdefaults</a></u> files.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> to figure out which display to use.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  default  for  no arguments should be to query, not to overwrite, so that it is consistent with other
