</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mac-robber</b> - collects data about allocated files in mounted filesystems

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mac-robber</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]
       <b>mac-robber</b> &lt;DIRECTORY&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mac-robber</b>  is  a  digital  investigation  tool (digital forensics) that collects metadata from allocated
       files in a mounted filesystem. This is useful during incident response when analyzing a  live  system  or
       when analyzing a dead system in a lab. The data can be used by the mactime tool in The Sleuth Kit (TSK or
       SleuthKit  only)  to  make  a timeline of file activity. The <b>mac-robber</b> tool is based on the grave-robber
       tool from TCT (The Coroners Toolkit).

       <b>mac-robber</b> requires that the filesystem be mounted by the operating  system,  unlike  the  tools  in  The
       Sleuth  Kit  that  process  the  filesystem themselves.  Therefore, <b>mac-robber</b> will not collect data from
       deleted files or files that have been hidden by rootkits.

       <b>mac-robber</b> will also modify the Access times on directories that are mounted with write permissions. When
       in forensics analysis you should mount the target partition as read-only.

       <b>mac-robber</b> is useful when dealing with a filesystem that is not supported by  The  Sleuth  Kit  or  other
       filesystem  analysis  tools.  You can run <b>mac-robber</b> on an obscure, suspect UNIX filesystem that has been
       mounted read-only on a trusted system.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Print help.

       <b>-V</b>     Show the version.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       To see metadata from all files in a directory (recursively):

             $ mac-robber /home/user/directory

       To make a timeline using mactime command from The Sleuth Kit (TSK) and setting Brazilian timezone:

             $ mac-robber /home/user/directory | mactime -z BRT

       An alternative is write the results into a file and read it using mactime:

             $ mac-robber /home/user/directory &gt; /tmp/files.mr
             $ mactime -b /tmp/files.mr -z BRT
