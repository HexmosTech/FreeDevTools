</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       watchman-wait - waits for changes to files.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>watchman</b> [-h] [--relative RELATIVE] [--fields FIELDS]
       [-s SEPARATOR] [-m MAX_EVENTS] [-p PATTERN [PATTERN ...]]
       [-t TIMEOUT]
       path [path ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>watchman-wait</b>  uses  the  watchman  service  to  efficiently and recursively watch your specified list of
       paths.

       It is suitable for waiting for changes to files from shell scripts.

       It can stop after a configurable number of events are observed.  The default is a single event.  You  may
       also remove the limit and allow it to execute continuously.

       watchman-wait  will  print  one  event  per  line.  The event information includes your specified list of
       fields, with each field separated by a space (or your choice of --separator).

       Events are consolidated and settled by the watchman server before they are dispatched to watchman-wait.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>OPTIONAL</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b>

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>

              show this help message and exit

       <b>--relative</b> <b>RELATIVE</b>

              print paths relative to this dir (default=PWD)

       <b>--fields</b> <b>FIELDS</b>

              Comma separated list of file information fields to return. The default is just  the  name.  For  a
              list  of possible fields, see: https://facebook.github.io/watch man/docs/cmd/query.html#available-
              fields

       <b>-s</b> <b>SEPARATOR,</b> <b>--separator</b> <b>SEPARATOR</b>

              String to use as field separator for event output.

       <b>-m</b> <b>MAX_EVENTS,</b> <b>--max-events</b> <b>MAX_EVENTS</b>

              Set the maximum number of events that will be processed. When the limit is reached,  watchman-wait
              will  exit.  The  default is 1. Setting the limit to 0 removes the limit, causing watchman-wait to
              execute indefinitely.

       <b>-p</b> <b>PATTERN</b> <b>[PATTERN</b> <b>...],</b> <b>--pattern</b> <b>PATTERN</b> <b>[PATTERN</b> <b>...]</b>

              Only emit paths that match this list of patterns. Patterns are applied by the watchman server  and
              are  matched  against the root-relative paths. You will almost certainly want to use quotes around
              your pattern list so that your  shell  doesn't  interpret  the  pattern.  The  pattern  syntax  is
              wildmatch style; globbing with recursive matching via '**'.

       <b>-t</b> <b>TIMEOUT,</b> <b>--timeout</b> <b>TIMEOUT</b>

              Exit if no events trigger within the specified timeout. If timeout is zero (the default) then keep
              running indefinitely.

       <b>POSITIONAL</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b>

       <b>path</b>

              path(s) to watch

       <b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b>

       <b>0</b>

              After successfully waiting for event(s)

       <b>1</b>

              In case of a runtime error of some kind

       <b>2</b>

              The -t/--timeout option was used and that amount of time passed before an event was received

       <b>3</b>

              Execution was interrupted (Ctrl-C)
