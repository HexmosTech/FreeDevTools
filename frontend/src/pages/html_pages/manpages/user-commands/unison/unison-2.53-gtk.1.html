       unison — a multi-platform bi-directional file synchronization tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>unison</b> [<u>options</u>]
       <b>unison</b> <u>root1</u> <u>root2</u> [<u>options</u>]
       <b>unison</b> <u>profilename</u> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Unison</b>  is  a  file-synchronization tool for POSIX-compliant systems (e.g. *BSD and GNU/Linux, macOS) and
       Windows. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on different  hosts
       (or  different  disks  on the same host), modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating
       the changes in each replica to the other.

       Unison has been in use for over 20 years and many people use it to synchronize data they care about.

       Unison shares a number of features with other tools. Some of the distinguishing features are:
       <b>•</b>   Unlike simple mirroring or backup utilities, Unison can deal with  updates  to  both  replicas  of  a
           distributed directory structure.
       <b>•</b>   Unison  works  across platforms, allowing you to synchronize a Windows laptop with a Unix server, for
           example.
       <b>•</b>   Unlike most distributed filesystems, Unison is a user-level program that simply uses  normal  systems
           calls: there is no need to modify the kernel, to have superuser privileges on either host, or to have
           a FUSE implementation.
       <b>•</b>   Unison  works  between  any  pair of machines connected to the internet, typically communicating over
           <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1), but also directly over TCP. It is careful with network bandwidth, and  runs  well  over  slow
           links.  Transfers  of small updates to large files are optimized using a compression protocol similar
           to <u><a href="../man1/rsync.1.html">rsync</a></u>(1).
       <b>•</b>   Unison is resilient to failure. It is careful to leave the replicas and its own private structures in
           a sensible state at all times, even in case of abnormal termination or communication failures.

          -dumparchives       dump contents of archives just after loading
          -fastercheckUNSAFE  skip computing fingerprints for new files (experts only!)
          -selftest           run internal tests and exit

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Most of the options can be given as command line arguments or in a profile. On command line, but not in a
       profile, the options are specified with a leading dash. Like this: <b>-option</b>.

       <b>acl</b>     When this flag is set to <b>true</b>, the ACLs of files and directories are synchronized.  The  type  of
               ACLs depends on the platform and filesystem support. On Unix-like platforms it can be NFSv4 ACLs,
               for example.

       <b>addprefsto</b> <u>xxx</u>
               By  default,  new  preferences  added  by  Unison  (e.g., new <b>ignore</b> clauses) will be appended to
               whatever preference file Unison was told to load  at  the  beginning  of  the  run.  Setting  the
               preference  <b>addprefsto</b>  <u>filename</u>  makes  Unison  add  new  preferences to the file named <u>filename</u>
               instead.

       <b>addversionno</b>
               When this flag is set to <b>true</b>, Unison will use <b>unison-</b><u>currentmajorversionnumber</u> instead  of  just
               <b>unison</b>  as  the  remote  server  command  (note that the minor version number is dropped -- e.g.,
               unison-2.51). This  allows  multiple  binaries  for  different  versions  of  unison  to  coexist
               conveniently on the same server: whichever version is run on the client, the same version will be
               selected on the server.

       <b>atomic</b> <u>xxx</u>
               This  preference  specifies  paths  for  directories whose contents will be considered as a group
               rather than individually when they are both modified. The backups are  also  made  atomically  in
               this case. The option <b>backupcurr</b> however has no effect on atomic directories.

       <b>auto</b>    When  set  to  <b>true</b>,  this  flag  causes  the  user interface to skip asking for confirmations on
               non-conflicting changes. (More precisely, when the user interface is done setting the propagation
               direction for one entry and is about to move to the next, it will skip over  all  non-conflicting
               entries and go directly to the next conflict.)

       <b>backup</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Including  the  preference <b>-backup</b> <u>pathspec</u> causes Unison to keep backup files for each path that
               matches <u>pathspec</u>; directories (nor their permissions or any other metadata) are  not  backed  up.
               These  backup  files  are  kept  in the directory specified by the <b>backuplocation</b> preference. The
               backups are named according to the <b>backupprefix</b>  and  <b>backupsuffix</b>  preferences.  The  number  of
               versions  that  are  kept  is  determined by the <b>maxbackups</b> preference. The syntax of <u>pathspec</u> is
               described in Section “Path Specification” in the manual.

       <b>backupcurr</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Including the preference <b>-backupcurr</b> <u>pathspec</u> causes Unison to  keep  a  backup  of  the  <u>current</u>
               version of every file matching <u>pathspec</u>.  This file will be saved as a backup with version number
               000.  Such  backups  can  be  used  as inputs to external merging programs, for instance. See the
               documentation for the <b>merge</b> preference.  For  more  details,  see  Section  “Merging  Conflicting
               Versions”  in  the manual. The syntax of <u>pathspec</u> is described in Section “Path Specification” in
               the manual.

       <b>backupcurrnot</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Exceptions to <b>backupcurr</b>, like the <b>ignorenot</b> preference.

       <b>backupdir</b> <u>xxx</u>
               If this preference is set, Unison will use it as the name of the directory used to  store  backup
               files  specified  by the <b>backup</b> preference, when <b>backuplocation</b> is set to <b>central</b>.  It is checked
               <u>after</u> the <b>UNISONBACKUPDIR</b> environment variable.

       <b>backuploc</b> <u>xxx</u>
               This preference determines whether backups should be kept locally, near the original files, or in
               a central directory specified by the <b>backupdir</b> preference. If set to <b>local</b>, backups will be  kept
               in  the  same  directory  as  the  original  files, and if set to <b>central</b>, <b>backupdir</b> will be used
               instead.

       <b>backupnot</b> <u>xxx</u>
               The values of this preference specify paths or  individual  files  or  regular  expressions  that
               should  <u>not</u>  be  backed  up,  even  if  the  <b>backup</b>  preference selects them—i.e., it selectively
               overrides <b>backup</b>.

       <b>backupprefix</b> <u>xxx</u>
               When a  backup  for  a  file  <b>NAME</b>  is  created,  it  is  stored  in  a  directory  specified  by
               <b>backuplocation</b>,  in  a  file  called  <b>backupprefixNAMEbackupsuffix</b>.   <b>backupprefix</b>  can include a
               directory name (causing Unison to keep all backup files for a given directory in  a  subdirectory
               with  this  name),  and both <b>backupprefix</b> and <b>backupsuffix</b> can contain the string <u>$VERSION</u>, which
               will be replaced by the <u>age</u> of the backup (1 for the most recent, 2 for the second  most  recent,
               and  so  on...).  This  keyword is ignored if it appears in a directory name in the prefix; if it
               does not appear anywhere in the prefix or the suffix, it will  be  automatically  placed  at  the
               beginning of the suffix. One thing to be careful of: If the <b>backuploc</b> preference is set to <b>local</b>,
               Unison  will  automatically  ignore  <u>all</u>  files  whose  prefix  and suffix match <b>backupprefix</b> and
               <b>backupsuffix</b>.  So be careful to  choose  values  for  these  preferences  that  are  sufficiently
               different from the names of your real files.

       <b>backups</b>
               (<u>Deprecated</u>)  Setting  this  flag  to  true  is equivalent to setting <b>backuplocation</b> to <b>local</b> and
               <b>backup</b> to <b>Name</b> <b>*</b>.

       <b>backupsuffix</b> <u>xxx</u>
               See <b>backupprefix</b> for full documentation.

       <b>batch</b>   When this is set to <b>true</b>, the user interface  will  ask  no  questions  at  all.  Non-conflicting
               changes will be propagated; conflicts will be skipped.

       <b>clientHostName</b> <u>xxx</u>
               When  specified,  the host name of the client will not be guessed and the provided host name will
               be used to find the archive.

       <b>color</b> <u>xxx</u>
               When set to <b>true</b>, this flag enables color output in text mode user interface. When set to  <b>false</b>,
               all  color output is disabled. Default is to enable color if the <b>NO_COLOR</b> environment variable is
               not set.

       <b>confirmbigdel</b>
               When this is set to <b>true</b>, Unison will request an extra confirmation if it appears that the entire
               replica has been deleted, before  propagating  the  change.  If  the  <b>batch</b>  flag  is  also  set,
               synchronization  will be aborted. When the <b>path</b> preference is used, the same confirmation will be
               requested for top-level paths. (At the moment, this flag only affects the text  user  interface.)
               See also the <b>mountpoint</b> preference.

       <b>confirmmerge</b>
               Setting  this  preference  causes  both  the text and graphical interfaces to ask the user if the
               results of a merge command may be committed to the replica or not. Since the merge command  works
               on  temporary  files,  the user can then cancel all the effects of applying the merge if it turns
               out that the result is not satisfactory. In batch-mode, this preference has no effect. Default is
               false.

       <b>contactquietly</b>
               If this flag is set, Unison will skip displaying the  `Contacting  server'  message  (which  some
               users find annoying) during startup.

       <b>copymax</b> <u>n</u>
               (<u>Deprecated</u>)  A  number  indicating  how many instances of the external copying utility Unison is
               allowed to run simultaneously (default to 1).

       <b>copyonconflict</b>
               When this flag is set, Unison will make a copy of files that would otherwise  be  overwritten  or
               deleted  in  case  of  conflicting  changes,  and more generally whenever the default behavior is
               overridden. This makes it possible to automatically resolve conflicts in a fairly safe  way  when
               synchronizing continuously, in combination with the <b>-repeat</b> <b>watch</b> and <b>-prefer</b> <b>newer</b> preferences.

       <b>copyprog</b> <u>xxx</u>
               (<u>Deprecated</u>) A string giving the name of an external program that can be used to copy large files
               efficiently  (plus  command-line switches telling it to copy files in-place). The default setting
               invokes <b>rsync</b> with appropriate options—most users should not need to change it.

       <b>copyprogrest</b> <u>xxx</u>
               (<u>Deprecated</u>) A variant of <b>copyprog</b> that names an external program that should be used to continue
               the transfer of a large file that has already been partially transferred. Typically, <b>copyprogrest</b>
               will just be <b>copyprog</b> with one extra option (e.g., <b>--partial</b>, for  rsync).  The  default  setting
               invokes <b>rsync</b> with appropriate options—most users should not need to change it.

       <b>copythreshold</b> <u>n</u>
               (<u>Deprecated</u>)  A  number  indicating  above  what  filesize  (in  kilobytes) Unison should use the
               external copying utility specified by <b>copyprog</b>.  Specifying 0 will cause <u>all</u> copies  to  use  the
               external  program; a negative number will prevent any files from using it. The default is -1. See
               Section “Making Unison Faster on Large Files” in the manual for more information.

       <b>debug</b> <u>xxx</u>
               This preference is used to make Unison print various sorts of information about what it is  doing
               internally  on the standard error stream. It can be used many times, each time with the name of a
               module for which debugging information should be printed. Possible arguments  for  <b>debug</b>  can  be
               found  by  looking for calls to <b>Util.debug</b> in the sources (using, e.g., <b>grep</b>). Setting <b>-debug</b> <b>all</b>
               causes information from <u>all</u> modules to be printed (this mode of usage is the first one to try, if
               you are trying to understand something that Unison seems to be doing wrong); <b>-debug</b> <b>verbose</b> turns
               on some additional debugging output from some modules (e.g., it will show exactly what bytes  are
               being sent across the network).

       <b>diff</b> <u>xxx</u>
               This  preference can be used to control the name and command-line arguments of the system utility
               used to generate displays of file differences. The default is `<b>diff</b> <b>-u</b> <b>OLDER</b> <b>NEWER</b>'. If the value
               of this preference contains the substrings CURRENT1 and CURRENT2, these will be replaced  by  the
               names  of  the  files to be diffed. If the value of this preference contains the substrings NEWER
               and OLDER, these will be replaced by the names of files  to  be  diffed,  NEWER  being  the  most
               recently  modified  file  of  the two. Without any of these substrings, the two filenames will be
               appended to the command. In all cases, the filenames are suitably quoted.

       <b>doc</b> <u>xxx</u>
               The command-line argument <b>-doc</b> <u>secname</u> causes unison to display section <u>secname</u> of the manual  on
               the  standard  output  and  then  exit.  Use <b>-doc</b> <b>all</b> to display the whole manual, which includes
               exactly the same information as the printed and HTML manuals, modulo formatting. Use <b>-doc</b>  <b>topics</b>
               to obtain a list of the names of the various sections that can be printed.

       <b>dontchmod</b>
               By  default, Unison uses the 'chmod' system call to set the permission bits of files after it has
               copied them. But in some circumstances (and under some operating systems), the chmod call  always
               fails. Setting this preference completely prevents Unison from ever calling chmod.

       <b>dumbtty</b>
               When  set to <b>true</b>, this flag makes the text mode user interface avoid trying to change any of the
               terminal settings. (Normally, Unison puts the terminal in `raw mode', so that it  can  do  things
               like  overwriting  the  current  line.)  This is useful, for example, when Unison runs in a shell
               inside of Emacs. When <b>dumbtty</b> is set, commands to the user interface need to  be  followed  by  a
               carriage return before Unison will execute them. (When it is off, Unison recognizes keystrokes as
               soon as they are typed.) This preference has no effect on the graphical user interface.

       <b>dumparchives</b>
               When  this  preference  is  set, Unison will create a file unison.dump on each host, containing a
               text summary of the archive, immediately after loading it.

       <b>fastcheck</b> <u>xxx</u>
               When this preference is set to <b>true</b>, Unison will use the modification time and length of  a  file
               as  a  `pseudo  inode  number'  when  scanning  replicas for updates, instead of reading the full
               contents of every file. (This does not apply to the very first run, when Unison will always  scan
               all files regardless of this switch). Under Windows, this may cause Unison to miss propagating an
               update if the modification time and length of the file are both unchanged by the update. However,
               Unison  will never <u>overwrite</u> such an update with a change from the other replica, since it always
               does a safe check for updates just before propagating a change. Thus, it  is  reasonable  to  use
               this switch under Windows most of the time and occasionally run Unison once with <b>fastcheck</b> set to
               <b>false</b>,  if you are worried that Unison may have overlooked an update. For backward compatibility,
               <b>yes</b>, <b>no</b>, and <b>default</b> can be used in place of <b>true</b>, <b>false</b>, and <b>auto</b>.   See  Section  “Fast  Update
               Detection” in the manual for more information.

       <b>fastercheckUNSAFE</b>
               THIS FEATURE IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL AND SHOULD BE USED WITH EXTREME CAUTION. When this flag is set
               to <b>true</b>, Unison will compute a 'pseudo-fingerprint' the first time it sees a file (either because
               the  file  is new or because Unison is running for the first time). This enormously speeds update
               detection, but it must be used with care, as it can cause Unison to miss conflicts:  If  a  given
               path  in  the  filesystem contains files on <u>both</u> sides that Unison has not yet seen, and if those
               files have the same length but different contents, then Unison will not notice the presence of  a
               conflict.  If,  later,  one  of  the  files  is  changed,  the  changed  file will be propagated,
               overwriting the other. Moreover, even when the files are initially identical, setting  this  flag
               can  lead  to  potentially  confusing  behavior: if a newly created file is later touched without
               being modified, Unison will treat this conservatively as a potential  change  (since  it  has  no
               record  of  the  earlier  contents) and show it as needing to be propagated to the other replica.
               Most users should leave this flag off -- the small time savings of not fingerprinting  new  files
               is  not  worth  the  cost in terms of safety. However, it can be very useful for power users with
               huge replicas that are known to be already synchronized (e.g., because one  replica  is  a  newly
               created duplicate of the other, or because they have previously been synchronized with Unison but
               Unison's  archives  need  to be rebuilt). In such situations, it is recommended that this flag be
               set only for the initial run of Unison, so that new archives can be  created  quickly,  and  then
               turned off for normal use.

       <b>fat</b>     When  this  is  set  to  <b>true</b>, Unison will use appropriate options to synchronize efficiently and
               without error a replica located on a FAT filesystem on a non-Windows machine: do not  synchronize
               permissions  (<b>perms</b> <b>=</b> <b>0</b>); never use chmod (<b>dontchmod</b> <b>=</b> <b>true</b>); treat filenames as case insensitive
               (<b>ignorecase</b> <b>=</b> <b>true</b>); do not attempt to synchronize symbolic links (<b>links</b> <b>=</b> <b>false</b>);  ignore  inode
               number  changes  when  detecting  updates (<b>ignoreinodenumbers</b> <b>=</b> <b>true</b>). Any of these change can be
               overridden by explicitly setting the corresponding preference in the profile.

       <b>follow</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Including the preference <b>-follow</b> <u>pathspec</u> causes Unison to treat symbolic links matching <u>pathspec</u>
               as `invisible' and behave as if the object pointed to by the link had appeared literally at  this
               position  in the replica. See Section “Symbolic Links” in the manual for more details. The syntax
               of <u>pathspec</u> is described in Section “Path Specification” in the manual.

       <b>force</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Including  the  preference  <b>-force</b>  <u>root</u>  causes  Unison  to  resolve   all   differences   (even
               non-conflicting  changes)  in favor of <u>root</u>.  This effectively changes Unison from a synchronizer
               into a mirroring utility. You can also specify a unique prefix or suffix of the path  of  one  of
               the  roots or a unique prefix of the hostname of a remote root. You can also specify <b>-force</b> <b>newer</b>
               (or <b>-force</b> <b>older</b>) to force Unison to choose the file with the later (earlier)  modtime.  In  this
               case,  the  <b>-times</b>  preference  must also be enabled. If modtimes are equal in both replicas when
               using <b>newer</b> or <b>older</b> then this preference will have no effect  (changes  will  be  synced  as  if
               without  this preference or remain unsynced in case of a conflict). This preference is overridden
               by the <b>forcepartial</b> preference. This preference should be used only if you are <u>sure</u> you know what
               you are doing!

       <b>forcepartial</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Including the preference <b>forcepartial</b> <b>=</b> <u>PATHSPEC</u> -&gt; <u>root</u> causes Unison to resolve all differences
               (even non-conflicting changes) in favor of <u>root</u> for the files  in  <u>PATHSPEC</u>  (see  Section  “Path
               Specification”  in  the  manual  for  more  information).  This effectively changes Unison from a
               synchronizer into a mirroring utility. You can also specify a unique prefix or suffix of the path
               of one of the roots or a unique prefix of the hostname of a remote root.  You  can  also  specify
               <b>forcepartial</b>  <b>PATHSPEC</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>newer</b> (or <b>forcepartial</b> <b>PATHSPEC</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>older</b>) to force Unison to choose the
               file with the later (earlier) modtime. In this case, the <b>-times</b> preference must also be  enabled.
               If  modtimes  are equal in both replicas when using <b>newer</b> or <b>older</b> then this preference will have
               no effect (changes will be synced as if without this preference or remain unsynced in case  of  a
               conflict). This preference should be used only if you are <u>sure</u> you know what you are doing!

       <b>group</b>   When  this  flag  is set to <b>true</b>, the group attributes of the files are synchronized. Whether the
               group names or the group identifiers are synchronized depends on the preference <b>numerids</b>.

       <b>halfduplex</b>
               (<u>Deprecated</u>) When this flag is set to <b>true</b>, Unison network communication is  forced  to  be  half
               duplex   (the  client  and  the  server  never  simultaneously  emit  data).  If  you  experience
               unstabilities with your network link, this may help.

       <b>height</b> <u>n</u>
               Used to set the height (in lines) of the main window in the graphical user interface.

       <b>i</b>       Provide this preference in the command line arguments to enable interactive  profile  manager  in
               the  text user interface. Currently only profile listing and interactive selection are available.
               Preferences like <b>batch</b> and <b>silent</b> remain applicable to synchronization functionality.

       <b>ignore</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Including the preference <b>-ignore</b> <u>pathspec</u> causes Unison to completely  ignore  paths  that  match
               <u>pathspec</u>  (as well as their children). This is useful for avoiding synchronizing temporary files,
               object files, etc. The syntax of <u>pathspec</u> is described in Section  “Path  Specification”  in  the
               manual, and further details on ignoring paths is found in Section “Ignoring Paths” in the manual.

       <b>ignorearchives</b>
               When  this  preference is set, Unison will ignore any existing archive files and behave as though
               it were being run for the first time on these replicas. It is not a good idea to set this  option
               in a profile: it is intended for command-line use.

       <b>ignorecase</b> <u>xxx</u>
               When  set  to <b>true</b>, this flag causes Unison to treat filenames as case insensitive—i.e., files in
               the two replicas whose names differ in (upper- and lower-case) `spelling' are treated as the same
               file. When the flag is set  to  <b>false</b>,  Unison  will  treat  all  filenames  as  case  sensitive.
               Ordinarily,  when  the  flag  is  set  to  <b>default</b>,  filenames  are  automatically  taken  to  be
               case-insensitive if either host is running Windows or OSX. In rare circumstances it may be useful
               to set the flag manually.

       <b>ignoreinodenumbers</b>
               When set to true, this preference makes Unison not take advantage of inode  numbers  during  fast
               update  detection.  This  switch  should  be used with care, as it is less safe than the standard
               update detection method, but it can be  useful  with  filesystems  which  do  not  support  inode
               numbers.

       <b>ignorelocks</b>
               When  this preference is set, Unison will ignore any lock files that may have been left over from
               a previous run of Unison that was interrupted while reading or writing archive files; by default,
               when Unison sees these lock files it will stop  and  request  manual  intervention.  This  option
               should  be  set  only  if you are <u>positive</u> that no other instance of Unison might be concurrently
               accessing the same archive files (e.g., because there was only one instance of unison running and
               it has just crashed or you have just killed it). It is probably not  a  good  idea  to  set  this
               option in a profile: it is intended for command-line use.

       <b>ignorenot</b> <u>xxx</u>
               This preference overrides the preference <b>ignore</b>.  It gives a list of patterns (in the same format
               as  <b>ignore</b>)  for paths that should definitely <u>not</u> be ignored, whether or not they happen to match
               one of the <b>ignore</b> patterns. Note  that  the  semantics  of  <b>ignore</b>  and  <b>ignorenot</b>  is  a  little
               counter-intuitive.  When  detecting updates, Unison examines paths in depth-first order, starting
               from the roots of the replicas and working downwards.  Before  examining  each  path,  it  checks
               whether  it  matches <b>ignore</b> and does not match <b>ignorenot</b>; in this case it skips this path <u>and</u> <u>all</u>
               <u>its</u> <u>descendants</u>.  This means that, if some parent of a given path matches an <b>ignore</b> pattern, then
               it will be skipped even if the path itself matches an <b>ignorenot</b>pattern.  In  particular,  putting
               <b>ignore</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>Path</b>  <b>*</b>  in  your  profile  and  then using <b>ignorenot</b> to select particular paths to be
               synchronized will not work. Instead, you should use the <b>path</b>preference to choose particular paths
               to synchronize.

       <b>immutable</b> <u>xxx</u>
               This preference specifies paths for directories whose immediate children are all immutable  files
               —  i.e.,  once  a  file  has been created, its contents never changes. When scanning for updates,
               Unison does not check whether these files have been modified; this  can  speed  update  detection
               significantly (in particular, for mail directories).

       <b>immutablenot</b> <u>xxx</u>
               This preference overrides <b>immutable</b>.

       <b>include</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Include  preferences from a profile. <b>include</b> <u>name</u> reads the profile “name” (or file “name” in the
               <b>.unison</b> directory if profile “name” does not exist) and includes its contents as if it  was  part
               of a profile or given directly on command line.

       <b>key</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Used  in a profile to define a numeric key (0-9) that can be used in the user interface to switch
               immediately to this profile.

       <b>killserver</b>
               When set to  <b>true</b>,  this  flag  causes  Unison  to  kill  the  remote  server  process  when  the
               synchronization is finished. This behavior is the default for <b>ssh</b> connections, so this preference
               is  not  normally needed when running over <b>ssh</b>; it is provided so that socket-mode servers can be
               killed off after a single run of Unison, rather than waiting to accept future connections.  (Some
               users  prefer  to  start  a  remote socket server for each run of Unison, rather than leaving one
               running all the time.)

       <b>label</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Used in a profile to provide a descriptive string documenting its settings. (This is  useful  for
               users  that  switch  between  several profiles, especially using the `fast switch' feature of the
               graphical user interface.)

       <b>links</b> <u>xxx</u>
               When set to <b>true</b>, this flag causes Unison to synchronize symbolic links. When the flag is set  to
               <b>false</b>,  symbolic  links will be ignored during update detection. Ordinarily, when the flag is set
               to <b>default</b>, symbolic links are synchronized except when one of the hosts is running Windows. On a
               Windows client, Unison makes an attempt to detect if symbolic links are supported and allowed  by
               user  privileges. You may have to get elevated privileges to create symbolic links. When the flag
               is set to <b>default</b> and symbolic links can't be synchronized  then  an  error  is  produced  during
               update detection.

       <b>listen</b> <u>xxx</u>
               When  acting as a server on a TCP socket, Unison will by default listen on "any" address (0.0.0.0
               and [::]). This command-line argument allows to specify a different listening address and can  be
               repeated to listen on multiple addresses. Listening address can be specified as a host name or an
               IP address.

       <b>log</b>     When this flag is set, Unison will log all changes to the filesystems on a file.

       <b>logfile</b> <u>xxx</u>
               By  default,  logging messages will be appended to the file <b>unison.log</b> in your .unison directory.
               Set this preference if you prefer another file. It  can  be  a  path  relative  to  your  .unison
               directory. Sending SIGUSR1 will close the logfile; the logfile will be re-opened (and created, if
               needed) automatically, to allow for log rotation.

       <b>maxbackups</b> <u>n</u>
               This  preference  specifies  the  number of backup versions that will be kept by unison, for each
               path that matches the predicate <b>backup</b>.  The default is 2.

       <b>maxerrors</b> <u>n</u>
               This preference controls after how many errors Unison aborts a directory transfer. Setting it  to
               a  large  number  allows  Unison  to transfer most of a directory even when some files fail to be
               copied. The default is 1. If the preference is set too high, Unison may take a long time to abort
               in case of repeated failures (for instance, when the disk is full).

       <b>maxsizethreshold</b> <u>n</u>
               A number indicating above what filesize (in kilobytes) Unison should flag a conflict  instead  of
               transferring  the  file. This conflict remains even in the presence of force or prefer options. A
               negative number will allow every transfer independently of the size. The default is -1.

       <b>maxthreads</b> <u>n</u>
               This preference controls how much concurrency is allowed during the transport phase. Normally, it
               should be set  reasonably  high  to  maximize  performance,  but  when  Unison  is  used  over  a
               low-bandwidth  link  it may be helpful to set it lower (e.g. to 1) so that Unison doesn't soak up
               all the available bandwidth. The default is the special value 0, which mean 20 threads when  file
               content streaming is deactivated and 1000 threads when it is activated.

       <b>merge</b> <u>xxx</u>
               This  preference  can  be used to run a merge program which will create a new version for each of
               the files and the backup, with the last backup and both replicas. The syntax of <u>pathspec</u>  <u>-&gt;</u>  <u>cmd</u>
               is  described  in  Section  “Path  Specification”  in  the manual, and further details on Merging
               functions are present in Section “Merging Conflicting Versions” in the manual.

       <b>mountpoint</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Including the preference <b>-mountpoint</b> <b>PATH</b> causes Unison to double-check, at  the  end  of  update
               detection,  that  <b>PATH</b>  exists  and  abort  if it does not. This is useful when Unison is used to
               synchronize removable media. This preference can be given more  than  once.  See  Section  “Mount
               Points and Removable Media” in the manual.

       <b>nocreation</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Including  the  preference  <b>-nocreation</b> <u>root</u> prevents Unison from performing any file creation on
               root <u>root</u>.  You can also specify a unique prefix or suffix of the path of one of the roots  or  a
               unique  prefix  of the hostname of a remote root. This preference can be included twice, once for
               each root, if you want to prevent any creation.

       <b>nocreationpartial</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Including the preference <b>nocreationpartial</b> <b>=</b> <u>PATHSPEC</u> -&gt; <u>root</u> prevents Unison from performing any
               file creation in <u>PATHSPEC</u> on root <u>root</u> (see Section “Path Specification” in the manual  for  more
               information).  It is recommended to use <b>BelowPath</b> patterns when selecting a directory and all its
               contents.

       <b>nodeletion</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Including the preference <b>-nodeletion</b> <u>root</u> prevents Unison from performing any  file  deletion  on
               root  <u>root</u>.   You can also specify a unique prefix or suffix of the path of one of the roots or a
               unique prefix of the hostname of a remote root. This preference can be included twice,  once  for
               each root, if you want to prevent any deletion.

       <b>nodeletionpartial</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Including the preference <b>nodeletionpartial</b> <b>=</b> <u>PATHSPEC</u> -&gt; <u>root</u> prevents Unison from performing any
               file  deletion  in <u>PATHSPEC</u> on root <u>root</u> (see Section “Path Specification” in the manual for more
               information). It is recommended to use <b>BelowPath</b> patterns when selecting a directory and all  its
               contents.

       <b>noupdate</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Including  the  preference  <b>-noupdate</b>  <u>root</u>  prevents  Unison  from performing any file update or
               deletion on root <u>root</u>.  You can also specify a unique prefix or suffix of the path of one of  the
               roots or a unique prefix of the hostname of a remote root. This preference can be included twice,
               once for each root, if you want to prevent any update.

       <b>noupdatepartial</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Including  the  preference <b>noupdatepartial</b> <b>=</b> <u>PATHSPEC</u> -&gt; <u>root</u> prevents Unison from performing any
               file update or deletion in <u>PATHSPEC</u> on root <u>root</u> (see Section “Path Specification” in the  manual
               for more information). It is recommended to use <b>BelowPath</b> patterns when selecting a directory and
               all its contents.

       <b>numericids</b>
               When  this  flag  is  set  to <b>true</b>, groups and users are synchronized numerically, rather than by
               name. The special uid 0 and the special group 0 are never mapped via  user/group  names  even  if
               this preference is not set.

       <b>owner</b>   When  this  flag  is set to <b>true</b>, the owner attributes of the files are synchronized. Whether the
               owner names or the owner identifiers are synchronizeddepends on the preference <b>numerids</b>.

       <b>path</b> <u>xxx</u>
               When no <b>path</b> preference is given,  Unison  will  simply  synchronize  the  two  entire  replicas,
               beginning  from  the  given pair of roots. If one or more <b>path</b> preferences are given, then Unison
               will synchronize only these paths and their children. (This is useful for doing a  fast  sync  of
               just  one  directory, for example.) Note that <b>path</b> preferences are interpreted literally—they are
               not regular expressions.

       <b>perms</b> <u>n</u>
               The integer value of this preference is  a  mask  indicating  which  permission  bits  should  be
               synchronized.  It  is  set  by default to $0o1777$: all bits but the set-uid and set-gid bits are
               synchronised (synchronizing these latter  bits  can  be  a  security  hazard).  If  you  want  to
               synchronize  all bits, you can set the value of this preference to $-1$. If one of the replica is
               on a FAT [Windows] filesystem, you should consider using  the  <b>fat</b>  preference  instead  of  this
               preference. If you need Unison not to set permissions at all, set the value of this preference to
               $0$ and set the preference <b>dontchmod</b> to <b>true</b>.

       <b>prefer</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Including the preference <b>-prefer</b> <u>root</u> causes Unison always to resolve conflicts in favor of <u>root</u>,
               rather  than  asking for guidance from the user, except for paths marked by the preference <b>merge</b>.
               (The syntax of <u>root</u> is the same as for the <b>root</b> preference, plus the  special  values  <b>newer</b>  and
               <b>older</b>.)  You  can  also  specify  a  unique prefix or suffix of the path of one of the roots or a
               unique prefix  of  the  hostname  of  a  remote  root.  This  preference  is  overridden  by  the
               <b>preferpartial</b>  preference.  This preference should be used only if you are <u>sure</u> you know what you
               are doing!

       <b>preferpartial</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Including the preference <b>preferpartial</b> <b>=</b>  <u>PATHSPEC</u>  -&gt;  <u>root</u>  causes  Unison  always  to  resolve
               conflicts  in  favor  of  <u>root</u>,  rather  than asking for guidance from the user, for the files in
               <u>PATHSPEC</u> (see Section “Path Specification” in the manual for more information).  (The  syntax  of
               <u>root</u>  is  the  same as for the <b>root</b> preference, plus the special values <b>newer</b> and <b>older</b>.) You can
               also specify a unique prefix or suffix of the path of one of the roots or a unique prefix of  the
               hostname  of a remote root. This preference should be used only if you are <u>sure</u> you know what you
               are doing!

       <b>repeat</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Setting this preference causes the text-mode interface to  synchronize  repeatedly,  rather  than
               doing  it  just  once  and stopping. If the argument is a number, Unison will pause for that many
               seconds before beginning again. When the argument is <b>watch</b>, Unison relies  on  an  external  file
               monitoring  process  to  synchronize  whenever a change happens. You can combine the two with a <b>+</b>
               character to use file monitoring and also do a full scan every specified number of  seconds.  For
               example, <b>watch+3600</b> will react to changes immediately and additionally do a full scan every hour.

       <b>retry</b> <u>n</u>
               Setting  this preference causes the text-mode interface to try again to synchronize updated paths
               where synchronization fails. Each such path will be tried N times.

       <b>root</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Each use of this preference names the root of one of the  replicas  for  Unison  to  synchronize.
               Exactly  two roots are needed, so normal modes of usage are either to give two values for <b>root</b> in
               the profile, or to give no values in the profile and provide two on the command line. Details  of
               the  syntax of roots can be found in Section “Roots” in the manual. The two roots can be given in
               either order; Unison will sort them into a canonical order before doing anything  else.  It  also
               tries  to  `canonize' the machine names and paths that appear in the roots, so that, if Unison is
               invoked later with a slightly different name for the same root, it will be  able  to  locate  the
               correct archives.

       <b>rootalias</b> <u>xxx</u>
               When  calculating  the  name  of the archive files for a given pair of roots, Unison replaces any
               roots matching the left-hand side of any rootalias rule by the corresponding right-hand side.

       <b>rsrc</b> <u>xxx</u>
               When set to <b>true</b>, this flag causes Unison to synchronize resource forks  and  HFS  meta-data.  On
               filesystems that do not natively support resource forks, this data is stored in Carbon-compatible
               ._AppleDouble  files.  When  the  flag  is  set to <b>false</b>, Unison will not synchronize these data.
               Ordinarily, the flag is set to <b>default</b>, and these data are automatically synchronized  if  either
               host is running OSX. In rare circumstances it is useful to set the flag manually.

       <b>rsync</b>   Unison  uses  the  'rsync algorithm' for 'diffs-only' transfer of updates to large files. Setting
               this flag to false makes Unison use whole-file transfers  instead.  Under  normal  circumstances,
               there  is  no  reason  to  do  this,  but if you are having trouble with repeated 'rsync failure'
               errors, setting it to false should permit you to synchronize the offending files.

       <b>selftest</b>
               Run internal tests and exit. This option is mostly for developers and must be used carefully:  in
               particular,  it  will delete the contents of both roots, so that it can install its own files for
               testing. This flag only makes sense on the command line. When it is provided, no preference  file
               is  read:  all  preferences  must  be  specified  on  thecommand  line. Also, since the self-test
               procedure involves overwriting the roots and backup directory, the names of the roots and of  the
               backupdir  preference must include the string "test" or else the tests will be aborted. (If these
               are not given on the command line, dummy subdirectories in the current directory will be  created
               automatically.)

       <b>servercmd</b> <u>xxx</u>
               This  preference  can  be  used to explicitly set the name of the Unison executable on the remote
               server (e.g., giving a full path name), if necessary.

       <b>showarchive</b>
               When this preference is set, Unison will print out the 'true names'of the roots, in the same form
               as is expected by the <b>rootalias</b> preference.

       <b>silent</b>  When this preference is set to <b>true</b>, the textual user interface will print nothing at all, except
               in the case of errors. Setting <b>silent</b> to true automatically sets the <b>batch</b> preference to <b>true</b>.

       <b>socket</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Start unison as a server listening on a TCP socket (with TCP port number as argument) or a  local
               socket (aka Unix domain socket) (with socket path as argument).

       <b>sortbysize</b>
               When this flag is set, the user interface will list changed files by size (smallest first) rather
               than  by name. This is useful, for example, for synchronizing over slow links, since it puts very
               large files at the end of the  list  where  they  will  not  prevent  smaller  files  from  being
               transferred  quickly.  This  preference  (as well as the other sorting flags, but not the sorting
               preferences that require patterns as arguments) can be set interactively  and  temporarily  using
               the 'Sort' menu in the graphical and text user interfaces.

       <b>sortfirst</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Each  argument to <b>sortfirst</b> is a pattern <u>pathspec</u>, which describes a set of paths. Files matching
               any of these patterns will be listed first in the user  interface.  The  syntax  of  <u>pathspec</u>  is
               described in Section “Path Specification” in the manual.

       <b>sortlast</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Similar to <b>sortfirst</b>, except that files matching one of these patterns will be listed at the very
               end.

       <b>sortnewfirst</b>
               When  this  flag is set, the user interface will list newly created files before all others. This
               is useful, for example, for checking that newly created files are not  `junk',  i.e.,  ones  that
               should be ignored or deleted rather than synchronized.

       <b>source</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Include  preferences  from a file. <b>source</b> <u>name</u> reads the file “name” in the <b>.unison</b> directory and
               includes its contents as if it was part of a profile or given directly on command line.

       <b>sshargs</b> <u>xxx</u>
               The string value of this preference will be passed as additional arguments (besides the host name
               and the name of the Unison executable on the remote system) to the <b>ssh</b> command used to invoke the
               remote server. The backslash is an escape character.

       <b>sshcmd</b> <u>xxx</u>
               This preference can be used to explicitly set the name of the ssh executable (e.g., giving a full
               path name), if necessary.

       <b>stream</b>  (<u>Deprecated</u>) When this preference is set, Unison will use an experimental streaming protocol  for
               transferring file contents more efficiently. The default value is <b>true</b>.

       <b>terse</b>   When this preference is set to <b>true</b>, the user interface will not print status messages.

       <b>testserver</b>
               Setting  this  flag  on the command line causes Unison to attempt to connect to the remote server
               and, if successful, print a message and  immediately  exit.  Useful  for  debugging  installation
               problems. Should not be set in preference files.

       <b>times</b>   When  this  flag  is  set  to  <b>true</b>,  file  modification  times  (but not directory modtimes) are
               propagated.

       <b>ui</b> <u>xxx</u>  This preference selects either the graphical or the textual  user  interface.  Legal  values  are
               <b>graphic</b>  or  <b>text</b>.  Because this option is processed specially during Unison's start-up sequence,
               it can <u>only</u> be used on the command line. In preference files it has  no  effect.  If  the  Unison
               executable  was  compiled  with  only  a  textual  interface,  this  option  has  no effect. (The
               pre-compiled binaries are all compiled with both interfaces available.)

       <b>unicode</b> <u>xxx</u>
               When set to <b>true</b>, this flag causes Unison to perform case insensitive file  comparisons  assuming
               Unicode encoding. This is the default. When the flag is set to <b>false</b>, Latin 1 encoding is assumed
               (this  means  that  all  bytes  that  are  not  letters  in  Latin  1  encoding  will be compared
               byte-for-byte, even if they may be valid characters in some other encoding). When Unison runs  in
               case sensitive mode, this flag only makes a difference if one host is running Mac OS X. Under Mac
               OS X, it selects whether comparing the filenames up to decomposition, or byte-for-byte.

       <b>version</b>
               Print the current version number and exit. (This option only makes sense on the command line.)

       <b>watch</b>   Unison uses a file watcher process, when available, to detect filesystem changes; this is used to
               speed up update detection. Setting this flag to false disables the use of this process.

       <b>xattrignore</b> <u>xxx</u>
               Preference  <b>-xattrignore</b>  <u>namespec</u>  causes  Unison  to ignore extended attributes with names that
               match <u>namespec</u>.  This can be used to exclude extended attributes that would fail  synchronization
               due  to  lack  of permissions or technical differences at replicas. The syntax of <u>namespec</u> is the
               same as used for path specification (described in Section “Path Specification”  in  the  manual);
               prefer  the  <b>Path</b>  and  <b>Regex</b>  forms  over  the  <b>Name</b> form. The pattern is applied to the <u>name</u> of
               extended attribute, not to path. <u>On</u> <u>Linux</u>, attributes in the security and trusted namespaces  are
               ignored  by default (this is achieved by pattern <b>Regex</b> <b>!(security|trusted)[.].*</b>); also attributes
               used  to  store  POSIX  ACL  are  ignored  by  default  (this  is  achieved   by   pattern   <b>Path</b>
               <b>!system.posix_acl_*</b>).   To  sync  attributes  in  one  or  both  of  these  namespaces,  see  the
               <b>xattrignorenot</b> preference. Note that the namespace name must be prefixed with a "!"  (applies  on
               Linux  only).  All  names  not  prefixed  with  a "!" are taken as strictly belonging to the user
               namespace and therefore the "!user." prefix is never used.

       <b>xattrignorenot</b> <u>xxx</u>
               This preference overrides the preference <b>xattrignore</b>.  It gives a list of patterns (in  the  same
               format  as  <b>xattrignore</b>)  for extended attributes that should <u>not</u> be ignored, whether or not they
               happen to match one of the <b>xattrignore</b> patterns. It  is  possible  to  synchronize  only  desired
               attributes  by  ignoring  all  attributes (for example, by setting <b>xattrignore</b> to <b>Path</b> <b>*</b> and then
               adding <b>xattrignorenot</b> for extended attributes that should be synchronized. <u>On</u>  <u>Linux</u>,  attributes
               in  the security and trusted namespaces are ignored by default. To sync attributes in one or both
               of these namespaces, you may add an <b>xattrignorenot</b> pattern like  <b>Path</b>  <b>!security.*</b>  to  sync  all
               attributes  in  the security namespace, or <b>Path</b> <b>!security.selinux</b> to sync a specific attribute in
               an otherwise ignored namespace. A pattern like <b>Path</b> <b>!system.posix_acl_*</b> can be used to sync POSIX
               ACLs on Linux. Note that the namespace name must be prefixed with a "!" (applies on Linux  only).
               All  names  not  prefixed  with  a  "!" are taken as strictly belonging to the user namespace and
               therefore the "!user." prefix is never used.

       <b>xattrs</b>  When this flag is set to <b>true</b>, the extended attributes of files and directories are synchronized.
               System extended attributes are not synchronized.

       <b>xferbycopying</b>
               When this preference is set, Unison will try to  avoid  transferring  file  contents  across  the
               network  by  recognizing  when  a  file  with  the required contents already exists in the target
               replica. This usually allows file moves to be propagated very quickly. The default value is <b>true</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ROOTS</b></h4><pre>
       A replica’s root tells Unison where to find a set of files  to  be  synchronized,  either  on  the  local
       machine or on a remote host. For example,

             <b>relative/path/of/root</b>

       specifies a local root relative to the directory where Unison is started, while

             <b>/absolute/path/of/root</b>

       specifies  a  root  relative  to the top of the local filesystem, independent of where Unison is running.
       Remote roots can begin with <b>ssh://</b> to indicate that the remote server should be started with <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1):

             <b>ssh://remotehost//absolute/path/of/root</b>
             <b>ssh://user@remotehost/relative/path/of/root</b>

       If the remote server is already running (in the socket mode), then the syntax

             <b>socket://remotehost:portnum//absolute/path/of/root</b>
             <b>socket://remotehost:portnum/relative/path/of/root</b>
             <b>socket://[IPv6literal]:portnum/path</b>

       is used to specify the hostname and the port that the client Unison should use to contact it. Syntax

             <b>socket://{path/of/socket}//absolute/path/of/root</b>
             <b>socket://{path/of/socket}/relative/path/of/root</b>

       is used to specify the Unix domain socket the client Unison should use to contact the server.

       The syntax for roots is based on that of URIs (described in RFC 2396). The full grammar is:

         replica ::= [protocol:]//[user@][host][:port][/path]
                  |  path

         protocol ::= file
                   |  socket
                   |  ssh

         user ::= [-_a-zA-Z0-9%@]+

         host ::= [-_a-zA-Z0-9.]+
               |  \[ [a-f0-9:.]+ zone? \]     IPv6 literals (no future format).
               |  { [^}]+ }                   For Unix domain sockets only.

         zone ::= %[-_a-zA-Z0-9~%.]+

         port ::= [0-9]+

       When path is given without any protocol prefix, the protocol is assumed to be <b>file:</b>.  Under  Windows,  it
       is  possible  to  synchronize  with  a remote directory using the <b>file:</b> protocol over the Windows Network
       Neighborhood. For example,

             <b>unison</b> <b>foo</b> <b>//host/drive/bar</b>

       synchronizes the local directory <u>foo</u> with the directory <u>drive:\bar</u> on the  machine  <b>host</b>,  provided  that
       host  is  accessible  via  Network Neighborhood. When the <b>file:</b> protocol is used in this way, there is no
       need for a Unison server to be running on the remote host. However, running Unison this  way  is  only  a
       good  idea  if  the  remote host is reached by a very fast network connection, since the full contents of
       every file in the remote replica will have to be transferred to the local machine to detect updates.

</pre><h4><b>PATHS</b></h4><pre>
       A path refers to a point within a set of files being synchronized; it is specified relative to  the  root
       of  the  replica.  Formally,  a  path  is  just  a  sequence of names, separated by <a href="file:/.">/.</a> Note that the path
       separator character is always a forward slash, no matter what operating system Unison is running on.  The
       empty path (i.e., the empty sequence of names) denotes the whole replica.

</pre><h4><b>PATH</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       Several Unison preferences (e.g., <b>ignore/ignorenot</b>,  <b>follow</b>,  <b>sortfirst/sortlast</b>,  <b>backup</b>,  <b>merge</b>,  etc.)
       specify  individual  paths  or  sets  of  paths. These preferences share a common syntax based on regular
       expressions. Each preference is associated with a list of path patterns; the paths  specified  are  those
       that match any one of the path pattern.

       Each  pattern  can  have one of three forms. The most general form is a Posix extended regular expression
       introduced by the keyword <b>Regex</b>.  (The collating sequences and character classes of  full  Posix  regexps
       are not currently supported.)

             <b>Regex</b> <u>regexp</u>

       For convenience, three other styles of pattern are also recognized:

             <b>Name</b> <u>name</u>

       matches any path in which the last component matches <u>name</u>,

             <b>Path</b> <u>path</u>

       matches exactly the path <u>path</u>, and

             <b>BelowPath</b> <u>path</u>

       matches the path <u>path</u> and any path below. The <u>name</u> and <u>path</u> arguments of the latter forms of patterns are
       <u>not</u> regular expressions. Instead, standard “globbing” conventions can be used in <u>name</u> and <u>path</u>:

       <b>-</b>   a  <b>*</b>  matches  any sequence of characters not including / (and not beginning with ., when used at the
           beginning of a <u>name</u>)

       <b>-</b>   a <b>?</b> matches any single character except / (and leading .)

       <b>-</b>   <b>[xyz]</b> matches any character from the set {x, y, z}

       <b>-</b>   <b>{a,bb,ccc}</b> matches any one of a, bb, or ccc. (Be careful not to put extra spaces  after  the  commas:
           these will be interpreted literally as part of the strings to be matched!)

       The  path  separator in path patterns is always the forward-slash character “/” — even when the client or
       server is running under Windows, where the normal separator character  is  a  backslash.  This  makes  it
       possible to use the same set of path patterns for both Unix and Windows file systems.

       A  path  specification  may be followed by the separator “ -&gt; ” itself followed by a string which will be
       associated to the matching paths:

             <b>Path</b> <u>path</u> -&gt; <u>associated</u> <u>string</u>

       Not all pathspec preferences use these  associated  strings  but  all  pathspec  preferences  are  parsed
       identically  and  the  strings may be ignored. Only the last match of the separator string on the line is
       used as a delimiter. Thus to allow a path specification  to  contain  the  separator  string,  append  an
       associated  string  to  it,  even  if  it is not used. The associated string cannot contain the separator
       string.

</pre><h4><b>PROFILES</b></h4><pre>
       A profile is a text file that specifies permanent settings for roots, paths, ignore patterns,  and  other
       preferences,  so that they do not need to be typed at the command line every time Unison is run. Profiles
       should reside in the <u>.unison</u> directory on the client machine. If Unison is started with just one argument
       <u>name</u> on the command line, it looks for a profile called <u>name</u><b>.prf</b> in  the  <u>.unison</u>  directory.  If  it  is
       started  with no arguments, it scans the <u>.unison</u> directory for files whose names end in <b>.prf</b> and offers a
       menu (when using the graphical user interface; for the text interface, you have to use the <b>-i</b> option). If
       a file named <u>default.prf</u> is found, its settings will be used as the default preferences.

       To set the value of a preference <b>p</b> permanently, add to the appropriate profile a line of the form

             <b>p</b> <b>=</b> <b>true</b>

       for a boolean flag or

             <b>p</b> <b>=</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>

       for a preference of any other type.  Whitespaces around <b>p</b> and the value are ignored. A profile  may  also
       include blank lines and lines beginning with #; both are ignored.

       When  Unison  starts,  it first reads the profile and then the command line, so command-line options will
       override settings from the profile.

</pre><h4><b>TERMINATION</b></h4><pre>
       When not synchronizing continuously, the text  interface  terminates  when  synchronization  is  finished
       normally or due to a fatal error occurring.

       In  the  text interface, to interrupt synchronization before it is finished, press <b>Ctrl-C</b> (or send signal
       <b>SIGINT</b> or <b>SIGTERM</b>).  This will interrupt update propagation as quickly as  possible  but  still  complete
       proper  cleanup.  If  the process does not stop even after pressing <b>Ctrl-C</b> then keep doing it repeatedly.
       This will bypass cleanup procedures and terminates the process forcibly (similar to <b>SIGKILL</b>).   Doing  so
       may leave the archives or replicas in an inconsistent state or locked.

       When  synchronizing  continuously (time interval repeat or with filesystem monitoring), interrupting with
       <b>Ctrl-C</b> or with signal <b>SIGINT</b> or <b>SIGTERM</b> works the same way as described above and will additionally  stop
       the  continuous  process.  To  stop only the continuous process and let the last synchronization complete
       normally, send signal <b>SIGUSR2</b> instead.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       UNISON  Unison stores a variety of information in a private directory on each host.  If  the  environment
               variable  <b>UNISON</b> is defined, then its value will be used as the path for this directory. This can
               be just a name, or a path. If <b>UNISON</b>  is  not  defined,  then  the  directory  depends  on  which
               operating system you are using. In Unix, the default is to use <u>$HOME/.unison</u>.  In Windows, if the
               environment  variable  <b>USERPROFILE</b>  is  defined, then the directory will be <u>$USERPROFILE\.unison</u>;
               otherwise, it will be <u>c:\.unison</u>.  On macOS, <u>$HOME/.unison</u> will be used if  it  is  present,  but
               <u>$HOME/Library/Application</u> <u>Support/Unison</u> will be created and used by default.

       UNISONLOCALHOSTNAME
               The  function that finds the canonical hostname of the local host (which is used, for example, in
               calculating the name of the archive file used to remember which  files  have  been  synchronized)
               normally  uses  the  <b>gethostname</b>  operating  system  call.  However,  if the environment variable
               <b>UNISONLOCALHOSTNAME</b> is set, its value will be used instead. This makes it easier to use Unison in
               situations where a machine’s name changes frequently (e.g., because it is a laptop and gets moved
               around a lot).

       UNISONBACKUPDIR
               When backups are stored centrally,  the  directory  used  to  hold  them  is  controlled  by  the
               preference  <b>backupdir</b>  and  the environment variable <b>UNISONBACKUPDIR</b>.  If both are specified then
               the environment variable overrides the preference.   If  neither  of  these  are  set,  then  the
               directory <u>$UNISON/backup</u> is used (see environment variable <b>UNISON</b> above).

       PAGER   Used by the text interface as the pager when displaying the differences between changed files.

       NO_COLOR
               If  the  environment  variable  <b>NO_COLOR</b> is set then Unison's text interface will not produce any
               color output by default. The <b>color</b> preference overrides this environment variable.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.unison">~/.unison</a></u>
               Unison stores a variety of information in a private directory on each host.  This is the  default
               path of this private directory. This path may be changed by the <b>UNISON</b> environment variable.

       <u><a href="file:~/.unison/">~/.unison/</a>*.prf</u>
               Profile files. Each profile is stored in a file named <u>profilename</u><b>.prf</b>.

       <u><a href="file:~/.unison/ar">~/.unison/ar</a>*</u>
       <u><a href="file:~/.unison/tm">~/.unison/tm</a>*</u>
       <u><a href="file:~/.unison/sc">~/.unison/sc</a>*</u>
               Main  and  temporary  archive  files.  These files may be deleted if you know what you are doing.
               Deleting an archive file is equivalent to using the <b>-ignorearchives</b> option.

       <u><a href="file:~/.unison/fp">~/.unison/fp</a>*</u>
               Fingerprint cache files. These files may  be  safely  deleted.  Keep  in  mind  that  deleting  a
               fingerprint  cache file means that any unsynchronized changes must be scanned again. Depending on
               your replicas, this may mean scanning gigabytes of file contents.

       <u><a href="file:~/.unison/lk">~/.unison/lk</a>*</u>
               Lock files indicating a running Unison process. These files may be deleted if you are careful and
               know that there is no Unison process currently running.  Deleting a lock file  is  equivalent  to
               using the <b>-ignorelocks</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Synchronize</b> <b>two</b> <b>local</b> <b>directories</b>

               <b>unison</b> <b>path/to/dir1</b> <b>/dir2</b>

         This command synchronizes two local directories using the default options.  Default options are defined
         by  Unison  and  can be overridden by user in a profile called “default”, which is by default stored in
         file <u><a href="file:~/.unison/default.prf">~/.unison/default.prf</a></u>

       <b>Synchronize</b> <b>a</b> <b>local</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>remote</b> <b>directory</b>

               <b>unison</b> <b>local/dir</b> <b>ssh://user@host//absolute/path</b>

         This command synchronizes a local directory (here specified by a relative path) and a remote  directory
         (here specified by an absolute path) using <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) and the default options (see example above).

       <b>Synchronize</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>options</b> <b>specified</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>profile</b>

               <b>unison</b> <b>profilename</b>

         This  command  reads all the options from the profile named “profilename” and synchronizes according to
         those options.

       <b>Synchronize</b> <b>with</b> <b>options</b> <b>specified</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>profile</b> <b>and</b> <b>roots</b> <b>on</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b>

               <b>unison</b> <b>profilename</b> <b>/path/to/dir</b> <b>ssh://host/path/on/server</b>

         This command reads all options from the profile named “profilename” with only the  roots  specified  on
         the  command  line.  Roots must not be specified in the profile as the roots from command line will not
         override roots in the profile, rather append to the list of roots.

       <b>Synchronize</b> <b>automatically</b>

               <b>unison</b> <b>-batch</b> <b>/path/to/dir</b> <b>ssh://host/path/on/server</b>

         This command synchronizes all non-conflicting changes automatically, once.

       <b>Synchronize</b> <b>continuously</b>

               <b>unison</b> <b>-repeat</b> <b>watch</b> <b>/path/to/dir</b> <b>ssh://host/path/on/server</b>

         This command first fully synchronizes the roots and then remains dormant, waiting for any file  changes
         within  either  root  and  then  automatically synchronizes these changes. This also works in a profile
         (<b>repeat</b> <b>=</b> <b>watch</b>).  If the filesystem monitoring helper program is not  available  or  not  desired  for
         other reasons, it is possible to make Unison synchronize repeatedly with a defined time interval:

               <b>unison</b> <b>-repeat</b> <b>60</b> <b>/path/to/dir</b> <b>ssh://host/path/on/server</b>

         This command synchronizes every 60 seconds. Using <b>-repeat</b> implies <b>-batch</b>.

         Currently, continuous synchronization is not possible when using the GUI.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       When  running  in  the textual mode, Unison returns an exit status, which describes whether, and at which
       level, the synchronization was successful. The exit status could be useful when Unison is invoked from  a
       script. Currently, there are four possible values for the exit status:

       0  successful synchronization; everything is up-to-date now.

       1  some files were skipped, but all file transfers were successful.

       2  non-fatal failures occurred during file transfer.

       3  a fatal error occurred, or the execution was interrupted.

       The graphical interface does not return any useful information through the exit status.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  are  using  Unison  versions  ≥  2.52  on all machines, you do not have to do anything extra for
       compatibility.

       Historically (versions &lt; 2.52), Unison versions had to be matched relatively exactly  for  them  to  work
       together.  Additionally,  the version of compiler used to build Unison also had significant relevance for
       compatibility.

       As of version 2.52, Unison has a degree of backward and forward compatibility.  This means three  things.
       First,  it  is possible for local and remote machines to run a different version of Unison. Second, it is
       possible for local and remote machines to run a version (same  or  different)  of  Unison  built  with  a
       different version of compiler. Lastly, it is possible to upgrade Unison on the local machine and keep the
       existing archive.

       For    more    information    on    co-existence    of    versions    &lt;    2.52    and    ≥   2.52,   see
       https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison/wiki/2.52-Migration-Guide

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       There is a full user manual (pdf, html and txt) included with Unison and available online.  Depending  on
       your  operating  system,  this  manual  may  have  been  installed at <u>/usr/share/doc/unison/</u> or a similar
       location. The manual can also be read in the GUI (look in the Help menu) or on the command line by <b>unison</b>
       <b>-doc</b> <b>all</b> (you probably want to pipe the output to a pager).
