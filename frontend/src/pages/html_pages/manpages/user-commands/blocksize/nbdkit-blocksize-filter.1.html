</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nbdkit-blocksize-filter - nbdkit blocksize filter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        nbdkit --filter=blocksize plugin [minblock=SIZE] [maxdata=SIZE] \
            [maxlen=SIZE] [plugin-args...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "nbdkit-blocksize-filter" is a filter that ensures various block size limits are met on transactions
       presented to the plugin.  The NBD protocol permits clients to send requests with a granularity as small
       as 1 byte or as large as nearly 4 gigabytes, although it suggests that portable clients should align
       requests to 512 bytes and not exceed 32 megabytes without prior coordination with the server.

       Meanwhile, some plugins require requests to be aligned to 512-byte multiples, or may enforce a maximum
       transaction size to bound the time or memory resources spent by any one command (note that nbdkit itself
       refuses a read or write larger than 64 megabytes, while many other NBD servers limit things to 32
       megabytes).  The blocksize filter can be used to modify the client requests to meet the plugin
       restrictions.

       This filter can be combined with <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-blocksize-policy-filter.1.html">nbdkit-blocksize-policy-filter</a></b>(1) to advertise different block sizes to
       the client.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       The nbdkit-blocksize-filter accepts the following parameters.

       <b>minblock=</b>SIZE
           The  minimum  block  size  and  alignment to pass to the plugin.  This must be a power of two, and no
           larger than 64k.  If omitted, this defaults to the minimum block size of the underlying plugin, or  1
           if  the  plugin did not report a minimum block size.  The filter rounds up read requests to alignment
           boundaries, performs read-modify-write cycles for any unaligned head or  tail  of  a  write  or  zero
           request,  and  silently  ignores  any  unaligned  head  or  tail  of a trim request.  The filter also
           truncates the plugin size down to an aligned value (as it cannot  safely  operate  on  the  unaligned
           tail).   If  you  need  to round the image size up instead to access the last few bytes, combine this
           filter with <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-truncate-filter.1.html">nbdkit-truncate-filter</a></b>(1).

           This parameter understands the suffix 'k' for 1024.

       <b>maxdata=</b>SIZE
           The maximum block size for any single transaction with data  (read  and  write).   If  omitted,  this
           defaults  to the minimum of 64 megabytes (that is, the nbdkit maximum) or any maximum reported by the
           underlying plugin.  This need not be a power of two, but must be an integer multiple  of  "minblock".
           The filter fragments any larger client request into multiple plugin requests.

           This parameter understands the suffixes 'k', 'M', and 'G' for powers of 1024.

       <b>maxlen=</b>SIZE
           The  maximum  length  for  any  single  transaction  without data (trim, zero, cache or extents).  If
           omitted, this defaults to 0xffffffff rounded down to "minblock"  alignment  (that  is,  the  inherent
           32-bit  limit of the NBD protocol).  This need not be a power of two, but must be an integer multiple
           of "minblock", and should be at least as large as "maxdata".  The filter fragments any larger  client
           request into multiple plugin requests.

           This parameter understands the suffixes 'k', 'M', and 'G' for powers of 1024.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Allow an arbitrary client to use the VDDK plugin (which is limited to 512-byte blocks), without having to
       fix the client to avoid sending unaligned requests:

        nbdkit --filter=blocksize vddk minblock=512 file=/absolute/path/to/file.vmdk

       Allow an arbitrary client tuned to nbdkit's 64 megabyte sizing to connect to a remote server that insists
       on 32 megabyte sizing, via the nbd plugin:

        nbdkit --filter=blocksize nbd maxdata=32M socket=/path/to/socket

       Serve  a  file  as if it were a block device that insists on 4k alignment, while still allowing access to
       any unaligned bytes at the end of the file:

        nbdkit --filter=blocksize --filter=truncate file /path/to/file \
        minblock=4k round-up=4k

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$filterdir/nbdkit-blocksize-filter.so</u>
           The filter.

           Use "nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of $filterdir.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
