       ea_conditioning - Compute the entropy of a conditioning function

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ea_conditioning</b>  <b>-v</b>  [<b>-q</b>] &lt;n_in&gt; &lt;n_out&gt; &lt;nw&gt; &lt;h_in&gt; [<b>-o</b> filename.json] <b>ea_conditioning</b> <b>-n</b> &lt;n_in&gt; &lt;n_out&gt;
       &lt;nw&gt; &lt;h_in&gt; [h' | <b>-i</b> filename] [<b>-o</b> filename.json]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Compute the entropy of a conditioning function.

       &lt;n_in&gt;: input number of bits to conditioning function.

       &lt;n_out&gt;: output number of bits from conditioning function.

       &lt;nw&gt;: narrowest internal width of conditioning function.

       &lt;h_in&gt;: input entropy to conditioning function.

       &lt;<b>-v</b>|<b>-n</b>&gt;: '-v' for vetted  conditioning  function,  '-n'  for  non-vetted  conditioning  function.  Vetted
              conditioning  is  the  default.   &lt;h'&gt;: entropy estimate per bit of conditioned sequential dataset
              (only for '-n' option).

       <b>-q</b>: Quiet mode, less output to screen.

       <b>-i</b>: Input file name, to run an entropy assessment on a non-vetted conditioned  data  file  and  use  that
              value as h'.

              This  program  computes  the  entropy  of  the  output of a conditioning function 'h_out' (Section
              3.1.5).  If the conditioning function is vetted, then

              h_out = Output_Entropy(n_in, n_out, nw, h_in)

              where 'Output_Entropy' is  specified  in  Section  3.1.5.1.2.  If  the  conditioning  function  is
              non-vetted then

              h_out = min(Output_Entropy(n_in, n_out, nw, h_in), 0.999*n_out, h'*n_out)

              as stated in Section 3.1.5.2.

       <b>-o</b>: Set Output Type to JSON

              Changes the output format to JSON and sets the file location for the output file.

       <b>--version</b>: Prints tool version information
