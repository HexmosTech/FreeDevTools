</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cpupower-idle-info - Utility to retrieve cpu idle kernel information

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       cpupower [ -c cpulist ] idle-info [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A tool which prints out per cpu idle information helpful to developers and interested users.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f</b> <b>--silent</b>
              Only print a summary of all available C-states in the system.

       <b>-e</b> <b>--proc</b>
              deprecated.   Prints  out  idle  information  in  old  /proc/acpi/processor/*/power  format.  This
              interface has been removed from the kernel for quite some time, do not let further code depend  on
              this option, best do not use it.

</pre><h4><b>IDLE-INFO</b> <b>DESCRIPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       CPU  sleep  state  statistics  and  descriptions  are retrieved from sysfs files, exported by the cpuidle
       kernel subsystem. The kernel only updates these statistics when  it  enters  or  leaves  an  idle  state,
       therefore  on a very idle or a very busy system, these statistics may not be accurate. They still provide
       a good overview about the usage and availability of processor sleep states on the platform.

       Be aware that the sleep states as exported by the hardware or BIOS and used by the Linux kernel  may  not
       exactly  reflect  the  capabilities of the processor. This often is the case on the X86 architecture when
       the acpi_idle driver is used. It is also possible that the hardware overrules the kernel requests, due to
       internal activity monitors or other reasons.  On recent X86 platforms it is often possible  to  read  out
       hardware  registers  which  monitor  the  duration of sleep states the processor resided in. The cpupower
       monitor tool (<a href="../man1/cpupower-monitor.1.html">cpupower-monitor</a>(1)) can be used to show real sleep state residencies. Please refer to  the
       architecture specific description section below.

</pre><h4><b>IDLE-INFO</b> <b>ARCHITECTURE</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>DESCRIPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>X86</b>
       POLL idle state

       If  cpuidle is active, X86 platforms have one special idle state.  The POLL idle state is not a real idle
       state, it does not save any power. Instead, a busy-loop is executed doing nothing for a short  period  of
       time.  This  state  is  used if the kernel knows that work has to be processed very soon and entering any
       real hardware idle state may result in a slight performance penalty.

       There exist two different cpuidle drivers on the X86 architecture platform:

       "acpi_idle" cpuidle driver

       The acpi_idle cpuidle driver retrieves available sleep states (C-states) from the ACPI BIOS tables  (from
       the  _CST  ACPI function on recent platforms or from the FADT BIOS table on older ones).  The C1 state is
       not retrieved from ACPI tables. If the C1 state is entered, the kernel will call the hlt instruction  (or
       mwait on Intel).

       "intel_idle" cpuidle driver

       In  kernel  2.6.36  the  intel_idle  driver  was  introduced.  It only serves recent Intel CPUs (Nehalem,
       Westmere, Sandybridge, Atoms or newer). On older Intel CPUs the acpi_idle driver is still  used  (if  the
       BIOS  provides  C-state  ACPI  tables).   The intel_idle driver knows the sleep state capabilities of the
       processor and ignores ACPI BIOS exported processor sleep states tables.

       By default only values of core zero are displayed. How to display settings of other cores is described in
       the <a href="../man1/cpupower.1.html">cpupower</a>(1) manpage in the --cpu option section.
