</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       headache - A program to manage the license of your source file.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>headache</b> [-h <u>file</u>] [-c <u>file</u>] [-r] [-help | --help] <u>file</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>headache</b> command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not
       have a manual page.

       It is a common usage to put at the beginning of source code files a short header giving, for instance,
       some copyright information.  <b>headache</b> is a simple and lightweight tool for managing easily these headers.
       Among its functionalities, one may mention:

       •   Headers must generally be generated as comments in source code files.  <b>headache</b> deals with different
           files types and generates for each of them headers in an appropriate format.

       •   Headers automatically detects existing headers and removes them. Thus, you can use it to update
           headers in a set of files.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       file
           Name of one file to process

       -h file
           Create a header with text coming from file

       -c file
           Read the given configuration file

       -help, --help
           Display the option list of <b>headache</b>

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Let us illustrate the use of this tool with a small example. Assume you have a small project mixing C and
       Caml code consisting in three files 'foo.c', 'bar.ml' and 'bar.mli'', and you want to equip them with
       some header. First of all, write a header file, i.e. a plain text file including the information headers
       must mention. An example of such a file is given in figure 1. In the following, we assume this file is
       named 'myheader' and is in the same directory as source files.

       Then, in order to generate headers, just run the command : <b>headache</b> <b>-h</b> <b>myheader</b> <b>foo.c</b> <b>bar.ml</b> <b>bar.mli</b>

       Each file is equipped with an header including the text given in the header file 'myheader', surrounded
       by some extra characters depending on its format making it a comment (e.g. '(*' and '*)' in '.ml' files).
       If you update the header file 'myheader', you simply need to re-run the above command to update headers
       in source code files.

       Similarly, running : <b>headache</b> <b>-r</b> <b>foo.c</b> <b>bar.ml</b> <b>bar.mli</b> removes any existing in files 'foo.c', 'bar.ml' and
       'bar.mli'. Files which do not have a header are kept unchanged.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       File types and format of header may be specified by a configuration file. By default, the default builtin
       configuration file given in figure 2 is used. You can also use your own configuration file thanks to the
       <b>-c</b> option : <b>headache</b> <b>-c</b> <b>myconfig</b> <b>-h</b> <b>myheader</b> <b>foo.c</b> <b>bar.ml</b> <b>bar.mli</b>

       In order to write your own configuration, you can follow the example given in figure 2. A configuration
       file consists in a list of entries separated by the character '|'. Each of them is made of two parts
       separated by an '-&gt;'.

       The first one is a regular expression. (Regular expression are enclosed within double quotes and have the
       same syntax as in Gnu Emacs.)  <b>headache</b> determines file types according to file basenames; thus, each
       file is dealt with using the first line its name matches.

       The second one describes the format of headers for files of this type. It consists of the name of a model
       (e.g. 'frame'), possibly followed by a list of arguments. Arguments are named: 'open:"(*"' means that the
       value of the argument 'open' is '(*'.  <b>headache</b> currently supports three models and a special keyword:

       frame
           With this model, headers are generated in a frame. This model requires three arguments: 'open' and
           'close' (the opening and closing sequences for comments) and 'line' (the character used to make the
           horizontal lines of the frame). Two optional arguments may be used 'margin' (a string printed between
           the left and right side of the frame and the border, by default two spaces) and 'width' (the width of
           the inside of the frame, default is 68).

       lines
           Headers are typeset between two lines. Three arguments must be provided: 'open' and 'close' (the
           opening and closing sequences for comments), 'line' (the character used to make the horizontal
           lines). Three optional arguments are allowed: 'begin' (a string typeset at the beginning of each
           line, by default two spaces), 'last' (a string typeset at the beginning of the last line) and 'width'
           (the width of the lines, default is 70).

       no
           This model generates no header and has no argument.

       skip
           Skip line corresponding to one of the "match" parameters regexp. For this kind of line, every first
           part pattern that matches the file basename is taken into account.
