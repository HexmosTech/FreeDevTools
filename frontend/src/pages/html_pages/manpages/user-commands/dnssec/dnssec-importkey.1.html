</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dnssec-importkey - import DNSKEY records from external systems so they can be managed

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dnssec-importkey</b> [<b>-K</b> directory] [<b>-L</b> ttl] [<b>-P</b> date/offset] [<b>-P</b> sync date/offset] [<b>-D</b> date/offset] [<b>-D</b> sync
       date/offset] [<b>-h</b>] [<b>-v</b> level] [<b>-V</b>] {keyfile}

       <b>dnssec-importkey</b>  {<b>-f</b>  filename}  [<b>-K</b>  directory]  [<b>-L</b>  ttl]  [<b>-P</b>  date/offset] [<b>-P</b> sync date/offset] [<b>-D</b>
       date/offset] [<b>-D</b> sync date/offset] [<b>-h</b>] [<b>-v</b> level] [<b>-V</b>] [dnsname]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dnssec-importkey</b> reads a public DNSKEY record and generates a pair of  .key/.private  files.  The  DNSKEY
       record  may be read from an existing .key file, in which case a corresponding .private file is generated,
       or it may be read from any other file or from the standard input, in which case both  .key  and  .private
       files are generated.

       The  newly  created  .private  file  does  <u>not</u>  contain private key data, and cannot be used for signing.
       However, having a .private file makes it possible to set publication (<u>-P</u>) and deletion (<u>-D</u>) times for the
       key, which means the public key can be added to and removed from the DNSKEY RRset on schedule even if the
       true private key is stored offline.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f</b> <b>filename</b>
              This option indicates the zone file mode. Instead of a public keyfile name, the  argument  is  the
              DNS  domain name of a zone master file, which can be read from <b>filename</b>. If the domain name is the
              same as <b>filename</b>, then it may be omitted.

              If <b>filename</b> is set to <b>"-"</b>, then the zone data is read from the standard input.

       <b>-K</b> <b>directory</b>
              This option sets the directory in which the key files are to reside.

       <b>-L</b> <b>ttl</b> This option sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is converted into a DNSKEY  RR.  This
              is  the  TTL used when the key is imported into a zone, unless there was already a DNSKEY RRset in
              place, in which case the existing TTL takes precedence. Setting the  default  TTL  to  <b>0</b>  or  <b>none</b>
              removes it from the key.

       <b>-h</b>     This option emits a usage message and exits.

       <b>-v</b> <b>level</b>
              This option sets the debugging level.

       <b>-V</b>     This option prints version information.

</pre><h4><b>TIMING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Dates  can  be  expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.  (which is the format used inside key
       files), or 'Day Mon DD HH:MM:SS YYYY' (as printed by <b>dnssec-settime</b> <b>-p</b>), or UNIX epoch time  (as  printed
       by <b>dnssec-settime</b> <b>-up</b>), or the literal <b>now</b>.

       The  argument can be followed by <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> and an offset from the given time. The literal <b>now</b> can be omitted
       before an offset. The offset can be followed by one of the suffixes <b>y</b>, <b>mo</b>, <b>w</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>h</b>, or <b>mi</b>, so that it  is
       computed  in  years  (defined  as  365  24-hour days, ignoring leap years), months (defined as 30 24-hour
       days), weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in seconds.

       To explicitly prevent a date from being set, use <b>none</b>, <b>never</b>, or <b>unset</b>.

       All these formats are case-insensitive.

       <b>-P</b> <b>date/offset</b>
              This option sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone. After that date, the  key
              is included in the zone but is not used to sign it.

              <b>sync</b> <b>date/offset</b>
                     This  option  sets  the date on which CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this key are to be
                     published to the zone.

       <b>-D</b> <b>date/offset</b>
              This option sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that date, the key is no longer
              included in the zone. (However, it may remain in the key repository.)

              <b>sync</b> <b>date/offset</b>
                     This option sets the date on which the CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this key  are  to
                     be deleted.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       A   keyfile  can  be  designed  by  the  key  identification  <b>Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii</b>  or  the  full  file  name
       <b>Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key</b>, as generated by <u>dnssec-keygen</u>.
