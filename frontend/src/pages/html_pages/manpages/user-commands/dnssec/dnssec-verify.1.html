</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dnssec-verify - DNSSEC zone verification tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dnssec-verify</b>  [<b>-c</b>  class]  [<b>-E</b>  engine] [<b>-I</b> input-format] [<b>-J</b> filename] [<b>-o</b> origin] [<b>-q</b>] [<b>-v</b> level] [<b>-V</b>]
       [<b>-x</b>] [<b>-z</b>] {zonefile}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dnssec-verify</b> verifies that a zone is fully signed for each algorithm found in the DNSKEY RRset  for  the
       zone, and that the NSEC/NSEC3 chains are complete.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b> <b>class</b>
              This option specifies the DNS class of the zone.

       <b>-E</b> <b>engine</b>
              This option specifies the cryptographic hardware to use, when applicable.

              When  BIND  9  is  built  with OpenSSL, this needs to be set to the OpenSSL engine identifier that
              drives the cryptographic accelerator or hardware service module (usually <b>pkcs11</b>).

       <b>-I</b> <b>input-format</b>
              This option sets the format of the input zone file. Possible formats are <b>text</b>  (the  default)  and
              <b>raw</b>.  This  option  is  primarily intended to be used for dynamic signed zones, so that the dumped
              zone file in a non-text format containing updates can be verified independently.  This  option  is
              not useful for non-dynamic zones.

       <b>-J</b> <b>filename</b>
              This  option  tells  <b>dnssec-verify</b>  to  read the journal from the given file when loading the zone
              file.

       <b>-o</b> <b>origin</b>
              This option indicates the zone origin. If not specified, the name of the zone file is  assumed  to
              be the origin.

       <b>-v</b> <b>level</b>
              This option sets the debugging level.

       <b>-V</b>     This option prints version information.

       <b>-q</b>     This  option sets quiet mode, which suppresses output.  Without this option, when <b>dnssec-verify</b> is
              run it prints to standard output the number of keys in use, the algorithms used to verify the zone
              was signed correctly, and other status information.  With this option,  all  non-error  output  is
              suppressed, and only the exit code indicates success.

       <b>-x</b>     This  option  verifies  only  that the DNSKEY RRset is signed with key-signing keys.  Without this
              flag, it is assumed that the DNSKEY RRset is signed by all active keys. When this flag is set,  it
              is not an error if the DNSKEY RRset is not signed by zone-signing keys. This corresponds to the <u>-x</u>
              <u>option</u> <u>in</u> <u>dnssec-signzone</u>.

       <b>-z</b>     This option indicates that the KSK flag on the keys should be ignored when determining whether the
              zone  is  correctly  signed.  Without  this  flag,  it  is  assumed  that  there is a non-revoked,
              self-signed DNSKEY with the KSK flag set for each algorithm, and that  RRsets  other  than  DNSKEY
              RRset are signed with a different DNSKEY without the KSK flag set.

              With  this  flag  set,  BIND  9  only  requires  that  for  each  algorithm, there be at least one
              non-revoked, self-signed DNSKEY, regardless of the KSK flag state, and that other RRsets be signed
              by a non-revoked key for the same algorithm that includes the self-signed key; the same key may be
              used for both purposes. This corresponds to the <u>-z</u> <u>option</u> <u>in</u> <u>dnssec-signzone</u>.

       <b>zonefile</b>
              This option indicates the file containing the zone to be signed.
