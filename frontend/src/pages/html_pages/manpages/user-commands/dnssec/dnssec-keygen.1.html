</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dnssec-keygen</b> generates keys for DNSSEC (Secure DNS), as defined in <u>RFC</u> <u>2535</u> and <u>RFC</u> <u>4034</u>.

       The  <b>name</b>  of  the key is specified on the command line. For DNSSEC keys, this must match the name of the
       zone for which the key is being generated.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-3</b>     This option uses an NSEC3-capable algorithm to generate a DNSSEC key. If this option is used  with
              an  algorithm  that  has  both  NSEC  and  NSEC3 versions, then the NSEC3 version is selected; for
              example, <b>dnssec-keygen</b> <b>-3</b> <b>-a</b> <b>RSASHA1</b> specifies the NSEC3RSASHA1 algorithm.

       <b>-a</b> <b>algorithm</b>
              This option selects the cryptographic algorithm. For DNSSEC keys, the value of <b>algorithm</b>  must  be
              one  of RSASHA1, NSEC3RSASHA1, RSASHA256, RSASHA512, ECDSAP256SHA256, ECDSAP384SHA384, ED25519, or
              ED448.

              These values are case-insensitive. In some cases, abbreviations are supported,  such  as  ECDSA256
              for  ECDSAP256SHA256  and  ECDSA384 for ECDSAP384SHA384. If RSASHA1 is specified along with the <u>-3</u>
              option, NSEC3RSASHA1 is used instead.

              This parameter <u>must</u> be specified except when using the <u>-S</u> option, which copies the algorithm  from
              the predecessor key.

              In  prior  releases, HMAC algorithms could be generated for use as TSIG keys, but that feature was
              removed in BIND 9.13.0. Use <u>tsig-keygen</u> to generate TSIG keys.

       <b>-b</b> <b>keysize</b>
              This option specifies the number of bits in the key.  The  choice  of  key  size  depends  on  the
              algorithm  used:  RSA keys must be between 1024 and 4096 bits; Diffie-Hellman keys must be between
              128 and 4096 bits. Elliptic curve algorithms do not need this parameter.

              If the key size is not specified, some algorithms have pre-defined defaults. For example, RSA keys
              for use as DNSSEC zone-signing keys have a default  size  of  1024  bits;  RSA  keys  for  use  as
              key-signing keys (KSKs, generated with <u>-f</u> <u>KSK</u>) default to 2048 bits.

       <b>-C</b>     This  option  enables  compatibility  mode,  which  generates an old-style key, without any timing
              metadata. By default, <b>dnssec-keygen</b> includes the key's creation date in the metadata  stored  with
              the  private  key;  other  dates  may be set there as well, including publication date, activation
              date, etc. Keys that include this data may be incompatible with older versions  of  BIND;  the  <u>-C</u>
              option suppresses them.

       <b>-c</b> <b>class</b>
              This  option  indicates that the DNS record containing the key should have the specified class. If
              not specified, class IN is used.

       <b>-d</b> <b>bits</b>
              This option specifies the key size in bits. For the algorithms  RSASHA1,  NSEC3RSASA1,  RSASHA256,
              and  RSASHA512  the  key  size must be between 1024 and 4096 bits; DH size is between 128 and 4096
              bits. This option is ignored for algorithms ECDSAP256SHA256, ECDSAP384SHA384, ED25519, and ED448.

       <b>-E</b> <b>engine</b>
              This option specifies the cryptographic hardware to use, when applicable.

              When BIND 9 is built with OpenSSL, this needs to be set to  the  OpenSSL  engine  identifier  that
              drives the cryptographic accelerator or hardware service module (usually <b>pkcs11</b>).

       <b>-f</b> <b>flag</b>
              This  option  sets  the  specified  flag  in  the  flag  field of the KEY/DNSKEY record.  The only
              recognized flags are ZSK (Zone-Signing Key), KSK (Key-Signing Key) and REVOKE.

              Note that ZSK is not a physical flag in the DNSKEY record, it is merely used  to  explicitly  tell
              that  you  want  to create a ZSK. Setting <u>-f</u> in conjunction with <u>-k</u> will result in generating keys
              that only match the given role set with this option.

       <b>-F</b>     This options turns on FIPS (US Federal Information Processing Standards) mode  if  the  underlying
              crytographic library supports running in FIPS mode.

       <b>-G</b>     This  option generates a key, but does not publish it or sign with it. This option is incompatible
              with <u>-P</u> and <u>-A</u>.

       <b>-h</b>     This option prints a short summary of the options and arguments to <b>dnssec-keygen</b>.

       <b>-K</b> <b>directory</b>
              This option sets the directory in which the key files are to be written.

       <b>-k</b> <b>policy</b>
              This option  creates  keys  for  a  specific  <b>dnssec-policy</b>.  If  a  policy  uses  multiple  keys,
              <b>dnssec-keygen</b>  generates multiple keys. This also creates a ".state" file to keep track of the key
              state.

              This option creates keys according to the <b>dnssec-policy</b> configuration, hence it cannot be used  at
              the same time as many of the other options that <b>dnssec-keygen</b> provides.

       <b>-L</b> <b>ttl</b> This  option  sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is converted into a DNSKEY RR. This
              is the TTL used when the key is imported into a zone, unless there was already a DNSKEY  RRset  in
              place,  in  which case the existing TTL takes precedence. If this value is not set and there is no
              existing DNSKEY RRset, the TTL defaults to the SOA TTL. Setting the default TTL to <b>0</b>  or  <b>none</b>  is
              the same as leaving it unset.

       <b>-l</b> <b>file</b>
              This  option  provides  a configuration file that contains a <b>dnssec-policy</b> statement (matching the
              policy set with <u>-k</u>).

       <b>-M</b> <b>tag_min:tag_max</b>
              This option sets the range of acceptable key tag values that <b>dnssec-keygen</b> will  produce.  If  the
              key tag of the new key or the key tag of the revoked version of the new key is outside this range,
              the  new  key will be rejected and another new key will be generated.  This is designed to be used
              when generating keys in a multi-signer scenario, where each operator is given a range of key  tags
              to  prevent  collisions  among  different operators.  The valid values for <b>tag_min</b> and <b>tag_max</b> are
              [0..65535].  The default allows all key tag values to be produced.  This option is ignored when <b>-k</b>
              <b>policy</b> is specified.

       <b>-n</b> <b>nametype</b>
              This option specifies the owner type of the key. The value of <b>nametype</b> must either be ZONE (for  a
              DNSSEC  zone key (KEY/DNSKEY)), HOST or ENTITY (for a key associated with a host (KEY)), USER (for
              a key associated with a user (KEY)), or OTHER (DNSKEY). These  values  are  case-insensitive.  The
              default is ZONE for DNSKEY generation.

       <b>-p</b> <b>protocol</b>
              This  option sets the protocol value for the generated key, for use with <u>-T</u> <u>KEY</u>. The protocol is a
              number between 0 and 255. The default is 3 (DNSSEC). Other possible values for this  argument  are
              listed in <u>RFC</u> <u>2535</u> and its successors.

       <b>-q</b>     This  option  sets quiet mode, which suppresses unnecessary output, including progress indication.
              Without this option, when <b>dnssec-keygen</b> is run interactively to generate an RSA or DSA  key  pair,
              it  prints  a  string  of  symbols  to  <b>stderr</b>  indicating the progress of the key generation. A <b>.</b>
              indicates that a random number has been found which passed an initial sieve test; <b>+</b> means a number
              has passed a single round of the Miller-Rabin primality test; and a  space  (  )  means  that  the
              number has passed all the tests and is a satisfactory key.

       <b>-S</b> <b>key</b> This  option  creates  a  new  key  which  is an explicit successor to an existing key.  The name,
              algorithm, size, and type of the key are set to match the existing key. The activation date of the
              new key is set to the inactivation date of the existing one. The publication date is  set  to  the
              activation date minus the prepublication interval, which defaults to 30 days.

       <b>-s</b> <b>strength</b>
              This  option  specifies  the strength value of the key. The strength is a number between 0 and 15,
              and currently has no defined purpose in DNSSEC.

       <b>-T</b> <b>rrtype</b>
              This option specifies the resource record type to use for the key. <b>rrtype</b> must be either DNSKEY or
              KEY. The default is DNSKEY when using a DNSSEC algorithm, but it can be overridden to KEY for  use
              with <a href="../man0/SIG.0.html">SIG</a>(0).

       <b>-t</b> <b>type</b>
              This  option  indicates  the  type  of  the key for use with <u>-T</u> <u>KEY</u>. <b>type</b> must be one of AUTHCONF,
              NOAUTHCONF, NOAUTH, or NOCONF. The default is AUTHCONF. AUTH refers to the ability to authenticate
              data, and CONF to the ability to encrypt data.

       <b>-V</b>     This option prints version information.

       <b>-v</b> <b>level</b>
              This option sets the debugging level.

</pre><h4><b>TIMING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS (which is  the  format  used  inside  key
       files),  or  'Day Mon DD HH:MM:SS YYYY' (as printed by <b>dnssec-settime</b> <b>-p</b>), or UNIX epoch time (as printed
       by <b>dnssec-settime</b> <b>-up</b>), or the literal <b>now</b>.

       The argument can be followed by <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> and an offset from the given time. The literal <b>now</b> can be  omitted
       before  an offset. The offset can be followed by one of the suffixes <b>y</b>, <b>mo</b>, <b>w</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>h</b>, or <b>mi</b>, so that it is
       computed in years (defined as 365 24-hour days, ignoring leap  years),  months  (defined  as  30  24-hour
       days), weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in seconds.

       To unset a date, use <b>none</b>, <b>never</b>, or <b>unset</b>.

       <b>-P</b> <b>date/offset</b>
              This  option sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone. After that date, the key
              is included in the zone but is not used to sign it. If not set, and if the <u>-G</u> option has not  been
              used, the default is the current date.

              <b>sync</b> <b>date/offset</b>
                     This  option  sets  the date on which CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this key are to be
                     published to the zone.

       <b>-A</b> <b>date/offset</b>
              This option sets the date on which the key is to  be  activated.  After  that  date,  the  key  is
              included  in the zone and used to sign it. If not set, and if the <u>-G</u> option has not been used, the
              default is the current date. If set, and <u>-P</u> is not  set,  the  publication  date  is  set  to  the
              activation date minus the prepublication interval.

       <b>-R</b> <b>date/offset</b>
              This  option  sets the date on which the key is to be revoked. After that date, the key is flagged
              as revoked. It is included in the zone and is used to sign it.

       <b>-I</b> <b>date/offset</b>
              This option sets the date on which the key is to be retired. After that date,  the  key  is  still
              included in the zone, but it is not used to sign it.

       <b>-D</b> <b>date/offset</b>
              This option sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that date, the key is no longer
              included in the zone. (However, it may remain in the key repository.)

              <b>sync</b> <b>date/offset</b>
                     This  option  sets the date on which the CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this key are to
                     be deleted.

       <b>-i</b> <b>interval</b>
              This option sets the prepublication  interval  for  a  key.  If  set,  then  the  publication  and
              activation dates must be separated by at least this much time. If the activation date is specified
              but  the  publication  date  is  not,  the  publication date defaults to this much time before the
              activation date; conversely, if the publication date is specified but  not  the  activation  date,
              activation is set to this much time after publication.

              If  the  key  is  being  created  as  an  explicit  successor  to  another  key,  then the default
              prepublication interval is 30 days; otherwise it is zero.

              As with date offsets, if the argument is followed by one of the suffixes <b>y</b>, <b>mo</b>, <b>w</b>, <b>d</b>,  <b>h</b>,  or  <b>mi</b>,
              the interval is measured in years, months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively. Without a
              suffix, the interval is measured in seconds.

</pre><h4><b>GENERATED</b> <b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       When  <b>dnssec-keygen</b>  completes  successfully,  it  prints  a  string  of the form <b>Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii</b> to the
       standard output. This is an identification string for the key it has generated.

       • <b>nnnn</b> is the key name.

       • <b>aaa</b> is the numeric representation of the algorithm.

       • <b>iiiii</b> is the key identifier (or footprint).

       <b>dnssec-keygen</b> creates two files, with names based on the printed  string.  <b>Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key</b>  contains
       the public key, and <b>Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private</b> contains the private key.

       The  <b>.key</b>  file  contains a DNSKEY or KEY record. When a zone is being signed by <u>named</u> or <u>dnssec-signzone</u>
       <u>-S</u>, DNSKEY records are included automatically. In other cases, the <b>.key</b> file can be inserted into a  zone
       file manually or with an <b>$INCLUDE</b> statement.

       The  <b>.private</b>  file  contains algorithm-specific fields. For obvious security reasons, this file does not
       have general read permission.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       To generate an ECDSAP256SHA256 zone-signing key for the zone <b>example.com</b>, issue the command:

       <b>dnssec-keygen</b> <b>-a</b> <b>ECDSAP256SHA256</b> <b>example.com</b>

       The command prints a string of the form:

       <b>Kexample.com.+013+26160</b>

       In    this    example,    <b>dnssec-keygen</b>    creates    the    files    <b>Kexample.com.+013+26160.key</b>     and
       <b>Kexample.com.+013+26160.private</b>.

       To generate a matching key-signing key, issue the command:

       <b>dnssec-keygen</b> <b>-a</b> <b>ECDSAP256SHA256</b> <b>-f</b> <b>KSK</b> <b>example.com</b>
