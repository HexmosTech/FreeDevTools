</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "gprof" produces an execution profile of C, Pascal, or Fortran77 programs.  The effect of called routines
       is incorporated in the profile of each caller.  The profile data is taken from the call graph profile
       file (<u>gmon.out</u> default) which is created by programs that are compiled with the <b>-pg</b> option of "cc", "pc",
       and "f77".  The <b>-pg</b> option also links in versions of the library routines that are compiled for
       profiling.  "Gprof" reads the given object file (the default is "a.out") and establishes the relation
       between its symbol table and the call graph profile from <u>gmon.out</u>.  If more than one profile file is
       specified, the "gprof" output shows the sum of the profile information in the given profile files.

       If you use gcc 2.95.x or 3.0 to compile your binaries, you may need to add the <b>-fprofile-arcs</b> to the
       compile command line in order for the call graphs to be properly stored in gmon.out.

       "Gprof" calculates the amount of time spent in each routine.  Next, these times are propagated along the
       edges of the call graph.  Cycles are discovered, and calls into a cycle are made to share the time of the
       cycle.

       Several forms of output are available from the analysis.

       The <u>flat</u> <u>profile</u> shows how much time your program spent in each function, and how many times that
       function was called.  If you simply want to know which functions burn most of the cycles, it is stated
       concisely here.

       The <u>call</u> <u>graph</u> shows, for each function, which functions called it, which other functions it called, and
       how many times.  There is also an estimate of how much time was spent in the subroutines of each
       function.  This can suggest places where you might try to eliminate function calls that use a lot of
       time.

       The <u>annotated</u> <u>source</u> listing is a copy of the program's source code, labeled with the number of times
       each line of the program was executed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These options specify which of several output formats "gprof" should produce.

       Many of these options take an optional <u>symspec</u> to specify functions to be included or excluded.  These
       options can be specified multiple times, with different symspecs, to include or exclude sets of symbols.

       Specifying any of these options overrides the default (<b>-p</b> <b>-q</b>), which prints a flat profile and call graph
       analysis for all functions.

       "-A[<u>symspec</u>]"
       "--annotated-source[=<u>symspec</u>]"
           The  <b>-A</b>  option causes "gprof" to print annotated source code.  If <u>symspec</u> is specified, print output
           only for matching symbols.

       "-b"
       "--brief"
           If the <b>-b</b> option is given, "gprof" doesn't print the verbose blurbs that try to explain  the  meaning
           of  all  of  the  fields in the tables.  This is useful if you intend to print out the output, or are
           tired of seeing the blurbs.

       "-B"
           The <b>-B</b> option causes "gprof" to print the call graph analysis.

       "-C[<u>symspec</u>]"
       "--exec-counts[=<u>symspec</u>]"
           The <b>-C</b> option causes "gprof" to print a tally of functions and the number of times each  was  called.
           If <u>symspec</u> is specified, print tally only for matching symbols.

           If the profile data file contains basic-block count records, specifying the <b>-l</b> option, along with <b>-C</b>,
           will cause basic-block execution counts to be tallied and displayed.

       "-i"
       "--file-info"
           The  <b>-i</b>  option causes "gprof" to display summary information about the profile data file(s) and then
           exit.  The number of histogram, call graph, and basic-block count records is displayed.

       "-I <u>dirs</u>"
       "--directory-path=<u>dirs</u>"
           The <b>-I</b> option specifies a list of search directories in which  to  find  source  files.   Environment
           variable  <u>GPROF_PATH</u>  can  also be used to convey this information.  Used mostly for annotated source
           output.

       "-J[<u>symspec</u>]"
       "--no-annotated-source[=<u>symspec</u>]"
           The <b>-J</b> option causes "gprof" not to print annotated source code.  If <u>symspec</u>  is  specified,  "gprof"
           prints annotated source, but excludes matching symbols.

       "-L"
       "--print-path"
           Normally,  source  filenames  are  printed  with the path component suppressed.  The <b>-L</b> option causes
           "gprof" to print the full pathname of source filenames, which is determined from  symbolic  debugging
           information in the image file and is relative to the directory in which the compiler was invoked.

       "-p[<u>symspec</u>]"
       "--flat-profile[=<u>symspec</u>]"
           The  <b>-p</b>  option  causes "gprof" to print a flat profile.  If <u>symspec</u> is specified, print flat profile
           only for matching symbols.

       "-P[<u>symspec</u>]"
       "--no-flat-profile[=<u>symspec</u>]"
           The <b>-P</b> option causes "gprof" to suppress printing a flat profile.  If <u>symspec</u> is  specified,  "gprof"
           prints a flat profile, but excludes matching symbols.

       "-q[<u>symspec</u>]"
       "--graph[=<u>symspec</u>]"
           The  <b>-q</b>  option causes "gprof" to print the call graph analysis.  If <u>symspec</u> is specified, print call
           graph only for matching symbols and their children.

       "-Q[<u>symspec</u>]"
       "--no-graph[=<u>symspec</u>]"
           The <b>-Q</b> option causes "gprof" to suppress printing the call graph.  If <u>symspec</u> is  specified,  "gprof"
           prints a call graph, but excludes matching symbols.

       "-t"
       "--table-length=<u>num</u>"
           The  <b>-t</b>  option  causes the <u>num</u> most active source lines in each source file to be listed when source
           annotation is enabled.  The default is 10.

       "-y"
       "--separate-files"
           This option affects annotated source output only.  Normally, "gprof" prints annotated source files to
           standard-output.  If this option is specified, annotated source for a  file  named  <u>path/filename</u>  is
           generated  in  the  file  <u>filename-ann</u>.  If the underlying file system would truncate <u>filename-ann</u> so
           that it overwrites the original <u>filename</u>, "gprof" generates annotated source in the file <u>filename.ann</u>
           instead (if the original file name has an extension, that extension is <u>replaced</u> with <u>.ann</u>).

       "-Z[<u>symspec</u>]"
       "--no-exec-counts[=<u>symspec</u>]"
           The <b>-Z</b> option causes "gprof" not to print a tally of functions and  the  number  of  times  each  was
           called.  If <u>symspec</u> is specified, print tally, but exclude matching symbols.

       "-r"
       "--function-ordering"
           The  <b>--function-ordering</b> option causes "gprof" to print a suggested function ordering for the program
           based on profiling data.  This option suggests an ordering which may improve paging,  tlb  and  cache
           behavior for the program on systems which support arbitrary ordering of functions in an executable.

           The  exact  details  of  how  to  force the linker to place functions in a particular order is system
           dependent and out of the scope of this manual.

       "-R <u>map_file</u>"
       "--file-ordering <u>map_file</u>"
           The <b>--file-ordering</b> option causes "gprof" to print a suggested .o link line ordering for the  program
           based  on  profiling  data.  This option suggests an ordering which may improve paging, tlb and cache
           behavior for the program on systems which do not  support  arbitrary  ordering  of  functions  in  an
           executable.

           Use of the <b>-a</b> argument is highly recommended with this option.

           The  <u>map_file</u>  argument is a pathname to a file which provides function name to object file mappings.
           The format of the file is similar to the output of the program "nm".

                   c-parse.o:00000000 T yyparse
                   c-parse.o:00000004 C yyerrflag
                   c-lang.o:00000000 T maybe_objc_method_name
                   c-lang.o:00000000 T print_lang_statistics
                   c-lang.o:00000000 T recognize_objc_keyword
                   c-decl.o:00000000 T print_lang_identifier
                   c-decl.o:00000000 T print_lang_type
                   ...

           To create a <u>map_file</u> with  GNU  "nm",  type  a  command  like  "nm  --extern-only  --defined-only  -v
           --print-file-name program-name".

       "-T"
       "--traditional"
           The <b>-T</b> option causes "gprof" to print its output in "traditional" BSD style.

       "-w <u>width</u>"
       "--width=<u>width</u>"
           Sets  width  of  output  lines to <u>width</u>.  Currently only used when printing the function index at the
           bottom of the call graph.

       "-x"
       "--all-lines"
           This option affects annotated source output only.  By default, only the lines at the beginning  of  a
           basic-block  are annotated.  If this option is specified, every line in a basic-block is annotated by
           repeating the annotation for the first line.  This behavior is similar to "tcov"'s <b>-a</b>.

       "--demangle[=<u>style</u>]"
       "--no-demangle"
           These options control whether C++ symbol names should be demangled when printing output.  The default
           is to demangle symbols.  The "--no-demangle" option may be used to  turn  off  demangling.  Different
           compilers  have  different  mangling  styles.   The optional demangling style argument can be used to
           choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.

   <b>Analysis</b> <b>Options</b>
       "-a"
       "--no-static"
           The <b>-a</b> option causes "gprof" to suppress the printing of  statically  declared  (private)  functions.
           (These  are  functions  whose  names  are not listed as global, and which are not visible outside the
           file/function/block where they were defined.)  Time spent in these  functions,  calls  to/from  them,
           etc.,  will  all  be  attributed to the function that was loaded directly before it in the executable
           file.  This option affects both the flat profile and the call graph.

       "-c"
       "--static-call-graph"
           The <b>-c</b> option causes the call graph of the program to be augmented by a heuristic which examines  the
           text space of the object file and identifies function calls in the binary machine code.  Since normal
           call  graph  records  are  only generated when functions are entered, this option identifies children
           that could have been called, but never  were.   Calls  to  functions  that  were  not  compiled  with
           profiling  enabled are also identified, but only if symbol table entries are present for them.  Calls
           to dynamic library routines are typically <u>not</u> found by this option.  Parents or  children  identified
           via this heuristic are indicated in the call graph with call counts of <b>0</b>.

       "-D"
       "--ignore-non-functions"
           The <b>-D</b> option causes "gprof" to ignore symbols which are not known to be functions.  This option will
           give more accurate profile data on systems where it is supported (Solaris and HPUX for example).

       "-k <u>from</u>/<u>to</u>"
           The <b>-k</b> option allows you to delete from the call graph any arcs from symbols matching symspec <u>from</u> to
           those matching symspec <u>to</u>.

       "-l"
       "--line"
           The <b>-l</b> option enables line-by-line profiling, which causes histogram hits to be charged to individual
           source  code  lines,  instead  of functions.  This feature only works with programs compiled by older
           versions of the "gcc" compiler.  Newer versions of "gcc" are designed to work with  the  "gcov"  tool
           instead.

           If  the  program  was  compiled with basic-block counting enabled, this option will also identify how
           many times each line of code was executed.  While line-by-line profiling can help isolate where in  a
           large  function  a  program is spending its time, it also significantly increases the running time of
           "gprof", and magnifies statistical inaccuracies.

       "--inline-file-names"
           This option causes "gprof" to print the source file after each symbol in both the  flat  profile  and
           the call graph. The full path to the file is printed if used with the <b>-L</b> option.

       "-m <u>num</u>"
       "--min-count=<u>num</u>"
           This  option  affects execution count output only.  Symbols that are executed less than <u>num</u> times are
           suppressed.

       "-n<u>symspec</u>"
       "--time=<u>symspec</u>"
           The <b>-n</b> option causes "gprof", in its call  graph  analysis,  to  only  propagate  times  for  symbols
           matching <u>symspec</u>.

       "-N<u>symspec</u>"
       "--no-time=<u>symspec</u>"
           The <b>-n</b> option causes "gprof", in its call graph analysis, not to propagate times for symbols matching
           <u>symspec</u>.

       "-S<u>filename</u>"
       "--external-symbol-table=<u>filename</u>"
           The  <b>-S</b>  option  causes "gprof" to read an external symbol table file, such as <u><a href="file:/proc/kallsyms">/proc/kallsyms</a></u>, rather
           than read the symbol table from the given object file (the default is "a.out"). This  is  useful  for
           profiling kernel modules.

       "-z"
       "--display-unused-functions"
           If  you  give  the <b>-z</b> option, "gprof" will mention all functions in the flat profile, even those that
           were never called, and that had no time spent in them.  This is useful in  conjunction  with  the  <b>-c</b>
           option for discovering which routines were never called.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Options</b>
       "-d[<u>num</u>]"
       "--debug[=<u>num</u>]"
           The <b>-d</b> <u>num</u> option specifies debugging options.  If <u>num</u> is not specified, enable all debugging.

       "-h"
       "--help"
           The <b>-h</b> option prints command line usage.

       "-O<u>name</u>"
       "--file-format=<u>name</u>"
           Selects  the  format  of  the  profile  data  files.  Recognized formats are <b>auto</b> (the default), <b>bsd</b>,
           <b>4.4bsd</b>, <b>magic</b>, and <b>prof</b> (not yet supported).

       "-s"
       "--sum"
           The <b>-s</b> option causes "gprof" to summarize the information in the profile data files it read  in,  and
           write  out  a  profile data file called <u>gmon.sum</u>, which contains all the information from the profile
           data files that "gprof" read in.  The file <u>gmon.sum</u> may be one of  the  specified  input  files;  the
           effect of this is to merge the data in the other input files into <u>gmon.sum</u>.

           Eventually you can run "gprof" again without <b>-s</b> to analyze the cumulative data in the file <u>gmon.sum</u>.

       "-v"
       "--version"
           The <b>-v</b> flag causes "gprof" to print the current version number, and then exit.

   <b>Deprecated</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options have been replaced with newer versions that use symspecs.

       "-e <u>function_name</u>"
           The  <b>-e</b>  <u>function</u> option tells "gprof" to not print information about the function <u>function_name</u> (and
           its children...) in the call graph.  The function will still be listed as a child  of  any  functions
           that  call  it,  but its index number will be shown as <b>[not</b> <b>printed]</b>.  More than one <b>-e</b> option may be
           given; only one <u>function_name</u> may be indicated with each <b>-e</b> option.

       "-E <u>function_name</u>"
           The "-E <u>function</u>" option works like the "-e" option, but time spent in the function (and children who
           were not called from anywhere else), will not be used to compute the percentages-of-time for the call
           graph.  More than one <b>-E</b> option may be given; only one <u>function_name</u> may be indicated  with  each  <b>-E</b>
           option.

       "-f <u>function_name</u>"
           The  <b>-f</b>  <u>function</u> option causes "gprof" to limit the call graph to the function <u>function_name</u> and its
           children (and their children...).  More than one <b>-f</b> option may be given; only one  <u>function_name</u>  may
           be indicated with each <b>-f</b> option.

       "-F <u>function_name</u>"
           The  <b>-F</b>  <u>function</u>  option  works  like  the  "-f" option, but only time spent in the function and its
           children (and their children...) will be used to determine total-time and percentages-of-time for the
           call graph.  More than one <b>-F</b> option may be given; only one <u>function_name</u> may be indicated with  each
           <b>-F</b> option.  The <b>-F</b> option overrides the <b>-E</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       "<u>a.out</u>"
           the namelist and text space.

       "<u>gmon.out</u>"
           dynamic call graph and profile.

       "<u>gmon.sum</u>"
           summarized dynamic call graph and profile.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  granularity  of the sampling is shown, but remains statistical at best.  We assume that the time for
       each execution of a function can be expressed by the total time for the function divided by the number of
       times the function is called.  Thus the time propagated along the  call  graph  arcs  to  the  function's
       parents is directly proportional to the number of times that arc is traversed.

       Parents  that  are  not  themselves  profiled will have the time of their profiled children propagated to
       them, but they will appear to be spontaneously invoked in the call graph listing, and will not have their
       time propagated further.  Similarly, signal catchers, even though profiled, will appear to be spontaneous
       (although for more obscure reasons).  Any profiled children of signal catchers should  have  their  times
       propagated properly, unless the signal catcher was invoked during the execution of the profiling routine,
       in which case all is lost.

       The  profiled program must call "exit"(2) or return normally for the profiling information to be saved in
       the <u>gmon.out</u> file.
