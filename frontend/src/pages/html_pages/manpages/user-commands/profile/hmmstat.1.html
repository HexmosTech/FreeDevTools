       hmmstat - summary statistics for a profile file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hmmstat</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>hmmfile</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>hmmstat</b> utility prints out a tabular file of summary statistics for each profile in <u>hmmfile</u>.

       <u>hmmfile</u>  may be '-' (a dash character), in which case profiles are read from a stdin pipe instead of from
       a file.

       The columns are:

       <b>idx</b>    The index of this profile, numbering each profile in the file starting from 1.

       <b>name</b>   The name of the profile.

       <b>accession</b>
              The optional accession of the profile, or "-" if there is none.

       <b>nseq</b>   The number of sequences that the profile was estimated from.

       <b>eff_nseq</b>
              The effective number of sequences that the profile was estimated  from,  after  HMMER  applied  an
              effective sequence number calculation such as the default entropy weighting.

       <b>M</b>      The length of the model in consensus residues (match states).

       <b>relent</b> Mean  relative  entropy  per match state, in bits. This is the expected (mean) score per consensus
              position. This is  what  the  default  entropy-weighting  method  for  effective  sequence  number
              estimation  focuses on, so for default HMMER3 models, you expect this value to reflect the default
              target for entropy-weighting.

       <b>info</b>   Mean information content per match state, in bits.  Probably not useful. Information content is  a
              slightly different calculation than relative entropy.

       <b>p</b> <b>relE</b> Mean  positional  relative  entropy,  in  bits.   This is a fancier version of the per-match-state
              relative entropy, taking into account the transition (insertion/deletion) probabilities; it may be
              a more accurate estimation of the average score contributed per model consensus position.

       <b>compKL</b> Kullback-Leibler divergence from the default background  frequency  distribution  to  the  average
              composition  of  the  profile's consensus match states, in bits.  The higher this number, the more
              biased the residue composition of the profile is. Highly  biased  profiles  can  slow  the  HMMER3
              acceleration pipeline, by causing too many nonhomologous sequences to pass the filters.
