</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hmmsearch - search profile(s) against a sequence database

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hmmsearch</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>hmmfile</u> <u>seqdb</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hmmsearch</b>  is  used  to  search  one  or  more profiles against a sequence database.  For each profile in
       <u>hmmfile</u>, use that query profile to search the target database of sequences in <u>seqdb</u>,  and  output  ranked
       lists of the sequences with the most significant matches to the profile.  To build profiles from multiple
       alignments, see <b>hmmbuild</b>.

       Either  the  query  <u>hmmfile</u>  or  the  target <u>seqdb</u> may be '-' (a dash character), in which case the query
       profile or target database input will be read from a stdin pipe instead of from a file.  Only  one  input
       source  can  come  through  stdin,  not both.  An exception is that if the <u>hmmfile</u> contains more than one
       profile query, then <u>seqdb</u> cannot come from stdin, because we can't rewind the streaming  target  database
       to search it with another profile.

       The  output  format  is  designed  to  be  human-readable,  but is often so voluminous that reading it is
       impractical, and parsing it is a pain. The <b>--tblout</b> and <b>--domtblout</b> options save output in simple tabular
       formats that are concise and easier to  parse.   The  <b>-o</b>  option  allows  redirecting  the  main  output,
       including throwing it away in /dev/null.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available options.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-o</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> Direct the main human-readable output to a file <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> instead of the default stdout.

       <b>-A</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> Save  a  multiple alignment of all significant hits (those satisfying <u>inclusion</u> <u>thresholds</u>) to the
              file <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>.

       <b>--tblout</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>
              Save a simple tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the per-target output, with one data line
              per homologous target sequence found.

       <b>--domtblout</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>
              Save a simple tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the per-domain output, with one data line
              per homologous domain detected in a query sequence for each homologous model.

       <b>--acc</b>  Use accessions instead of names in the main output, where available for profiles and/or sequences.

       <b>--noali</b>
              Omit the alignment section from the main output. This can greatly reduce the output volume.

       <b>--notextw</b>
              Unlimit the length of each line in the main output. The default is a limit of 120  characters  per
              line,  which  helps in displaying the output cleanly on terminals and in editors, but can truncate
              target profile description lines.

       <b>--textw</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Set the main output's line length limit to <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> characters per line. The default is 120.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>REPORTING</b> <b>THRESHOLDS</b></h4><pre>
       Reporting thresholds control which hits are reported in output files  (the  main  output,  <b>--tblout</b>,  and
       <b>--domtblout</b>).   Sequence hits and domain hits are ranked by statistical significance (E-value) and output
       is generated in two sections called per-target and per-domain output. In per-target output,  by  default,
       all  sequence hits with an E-value &lt;= 10 are reported. In the per-domain output, for each target that has
       passed per-target reporting thresholds,  all  domains  satisfying  per-domain  reporting  thresholds  are
       reported.  By  default, these are domains with conditional E-values of &lt;= 10. The following options allow
       you to change the default E-value reporting thresholds, or to use bit score thresholds instead.

       <b>-E</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> In the per-target output, report target sequences with an E-value of &lt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.  The default is 10.0,
              meaning that on average, about 10 false positives will be reported per query, so you can  see  the
              top of the noise and decide for yourself if it's really noise.

       <b>-T</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> Instead  of thresholding per-profile output on E-value, instead report target sequences with a bit
              score of &gt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.

       <b>--domE</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              In the per-domain output, for  target  sequences  that  have  already  satisfied  the  per-profile
              reporting  threshold, report individual domains with a conditional E-value of &lt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.  The default
              is 10.0.  A conditional E-value means the expected number of additional false positive domains  in
              the  smaller  search  space  of  those comparisons that already satisfied the per-target reporting
              threshold (and thus must have at least one homologous domain already).

       <b>--domT</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Instead of thresholding per-domain output on E-value, instead report domains with a bit  score  of
              &gt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>INCLUSION</b> <b>THRESHOLDS</b></h4><pre>
       Inclusion thresholds are stricter than reporting thresholds.  Inclusion thresholds control which hits are
       considered  to  be reliable enough to be included in an output alignment or a subsequent search round, or
       marked as significant ("!") as opposed to questionable ("?")  in domain output.

       <b>--incE</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Use an E-value of &lt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> as the per-target inclusion threshold.  The default is 0.01, meaning that
              on average, about 1 false positive would be expected in every 100 searches  with  different  query
              sequences.

       <b>--incT</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Instead  of  using E-values for setting the inclusion threshold, instead use a bit score of &gt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              as the per-target inclusion threshold.  By default this option is unset.

       <b>--incdomE</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Use a conditional E-value of &lt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> as the per-domain inclusion threshold, in  targets  that  have
              already satisfied the overall per-target inclusion threshold.  The default is 0.01.

       <b>--incdomT</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Instead of using E-values, use a bit score of &gt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> as the per-domain inclusion threshold.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>MODEL-SPECIFIC</b> <b>SCORE</b> <b>THRESHOLDING</b></h4><pre>
       Curated  profile  databases  may  define  specific bit score thresholds for each profile, superseding any
       thresholding based on statistical significance alone.

       To use these options, the profile must contain  the  appropriate  (GA,  TC,  and/or  NC)  optional  score
       threshold  annotation;  this  is  picked  up  by  <b>hmmbuild</b>  from  Stockholm  format alignment files. Each
       thresholding option has two scores: the per-sequence threshold &lt;x1&gt; and  the  per-domain  threshold  &lt;x2&gt;
       These  act  as if <b>-T</b> <u>&lt;x1&gt;</u> <b>--incT</b> <u>&lt;x1&gt;</u> <b>--domT</b> <u>&lt;x2&gt;</u> <b>--incdomT</b> <u>&lt;x2&gt;</u> has been applied specifically using each
       model's curated thresholds.

       <b>--cut_ga</b>
              Use the GA (gathering) bit scores in the model to set  per-sequence  (GA1)  and  per-domain  (GA2)
              reporting  and  inclusion  thresholds.  GA  thresholds are generally considered to be the reliable
              curated thresholds defining family membership; for example, in Pfam, these thresholds define  what
              gets included in Pfam Full alignments based on searches with Pfam Seed models.

       <b>--cut_nc</b>
              Use  the  NC  (noise  cutoff) bit score thresholds in the model to set per-sequence (NC1) and per-
              domain (NC2) reporting and inclusion thresholds. NC thresholds are generally considered to be  the
              score of the highest-scoring known false positive.

       <b>--cut_tc</b>
              Use  the  TC (trusted cutoff) bit score thresholds in the model to set per-sequence (TC1) and per-
              domain (TC2) reporting and inclusion thresholds. TC thresholds are generally considered to be  the
              score of the lowest-scoring known true positive that is above all known false positives.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>ACCELERATION</b> <b>PIPELINE</b></h4><pre>
       HMMER3  searches are accelerated in a three-step filter pipeline: the MSV filter, the Viterbi filter, and
       the Forward filter. The first filter is the fastest and most approximate; the last is  the  full  Forward
       scoring  algorithm.  There  is also a bias filter step between MSV and Viterbi. Targets that pass all the
       steps in the acceleration pipeline are then subjected to  postprocessing  --  domain  identification  and
       scoring using the Forward/Backward algorithm.

       Changing  filter  thresholds  only  removes  or  includes  targets  from  consideration;  changing filter
       thresholds does not alter bit scores, E-values, or alignments, all of  which  are  determined  solely  in
       postprocessing.

       <b>--max</b>  Turn  off  all filters, including the bias filter, and run full Forward/Backward postprocessing on
              every target. This increases sensitivity somewhat, at a large cost in speed.

       <b>--F1</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set the P-value threshold for the MSV filter step.  The default is 0.02, meaning that  roughly  2%
              of the highest scoring nonhomologous targets are expected to pass the filter.

       <b>--F2</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set the P-value threshold for the Viterbi filter step.  The default is 0.001.

       <b>--F3</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set the P-value threshold for the Forward filter step.  The default is 1e-5.

       <b>--nobias</b>
              Turn  off  the  bias  filter.  This increases sensitivity somewhat, but can come at a high cost in
              speed, especially if the query has biased residue  composition  (such  as  a  repetitive  sequence
              region,  or  if  it  is a membrane protein with large regions of hydrophobicity). Without the bias
              filter, too many sequences may pass the  filter  with  biased  queries,  leading  to  slower  than
              expected  performance  as  the  computationally  intensive Forward/Backward algorithms shoulder an
              abnormally heavy load.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--nonull2</b>
              Turn off the null2 score corrections for biased composition.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> Assert that the total number of targets in your searches is <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>, for the purposes of  per-sequence
              E-value calculations, rather than the actual number of targets seen.

       <b>--domZ</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Assert  that  the  total number of targets in your searches is <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>, for the purposes of per-domain
              conditional E-value calculations, rather than the number of  targets  that  passed  the  reporting
              thresholds.

       <b>--seed</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Set  the  random number seed to <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>.  Some steps in postprocessing require Monte Carlo simulation.
              The default is to use a fixed seed (42), so that  results  are  exactly  reproducible.  Any  other
              positive  integer  will  give  different  (but  also  reproducible)  results. A choice of 0 uses a
              randomly chosen seed.

       <b>--tformat</b> <u>&lt;s&gt;</u>
              Assert that target sequence file <u>seqfile</u> is in format <u>&lt;s&gt;</u>, bypassing format autodetection.  Common
              choices for <u>&lt;s&gt;</u> include: <b>fasta</b>, <b>embl</b>,  <b>genbank.</b>   Alignment  formats  also  work;  common  choices
              include:  <b>stockholm</b>, <b>a2m</b>, <b>afa</b>, <b>psiblast</b>, <b>clustal</b>, <b>phylip</b>.  For more information, and for codes for
              some less common formats, see main documentation.  The string <u>&lt;s&gt;</u> is  case-insensitive  (<b>fasta</b>  or
              <b>FASTA</b> both work).

       <b>--cpu</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Set  the  number of parallel worker threads to <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>.  On multicore machines, the default is 2.  You
              can also control this number by setting an environment variable,  <u>HMMER_NCPU</u>.   There  is  also  a
              master thread, so the actual number of threads that HMMER spawns is <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>+1.

              This option is not available if HMMER was compiled with POSIX threads support turned off.

       <b>--stall</b>
              For  debugging the MPI master/worker version: pause after start, to enable the developer to attach
              debuggers to the running master and worker(s) processes. Send SIGCONT signal to release the pause.
              (Under gdb: <b>(gdb)</b> <b>signal</b> <b>SIGCONT</b>) (Only available if optional MPI support was enabled at  compile-
              time.)

       <b>--mpi</b>  Run  under  MPI  control  with  master/worker  parallelization  (using  <b>mpirun</b>,  for  example,  or
              equivalent). Only available if optional MPI support was enabled at compile-time.
