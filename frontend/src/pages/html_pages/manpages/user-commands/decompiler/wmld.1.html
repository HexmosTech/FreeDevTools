       wmld - A basic WML bytecode decompiler

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       At  the  moment  this  is  a simple WML bytecode decompiler, wmld. This has been built out of the few WML
       bytecode references I have (they are incredibly difficult to get a hold of without having  to  sign  your
       life away on licensing agreements or paying ridiculous amounts of cash for).

       The  decompiler  can  now  handle  value  attributes  properly,  inline  strings,  the string table (with
       references by normal text or by variable name) and can now decode bytecode to useable WML code with  just
       about everything I can throw at it.

       I'd  probably  say  that this isn't alpha code anymore. It's now beta. It stops being beta when I test it
       with a LOT more bytecode.

       Usage: ./wmld file.wmlc [output.wml]
