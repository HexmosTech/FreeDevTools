</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       stopwatch — a stopwatch and timer program

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>stopwatch</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>stopwatch</b> does what its name implies - enables hand timing much like a physical stopwatch. It can also be
       used as a countdown timer. Stopwatch has millisecond accuracy and no artificial limit on hours.

</pre><h4><b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Press "start" to start the stopwatch and "stop" to stop it. "record" records the current time and selects
       it so that it can readily be pasted into other programs. Recorded times are marked with an L for "lap" or
       T for "total". When stopped, you can cut/paste/edit the time by hand and set it to any valid time. "zero"
       resets the time to zero. Holding down the shift key while pressing record or zero, records and then zeros
       the time.

       Time  moves forward or backward according to the Run menu. By default, time is stopped automatically when
       either the lap or total time reaches zero. To disable the automatic stop, unselect Run -&gt; Stop At Zero.
