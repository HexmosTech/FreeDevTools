</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gs - Ghostscript (PostScript and PDF language interpreter and previewer)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gs</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>files</u> ] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>gs</b> command invokes <b>Ghostscript</b>, an interpreter of Adobe Systems' <b>PostScript</b>(tm) and <b>Portable</b> <b>Document</b>
       <b>Format</b>  (PDF)  languages.   <b>gs</b> reads "files" in sequence and executes them as Ghostscript programs. After
       doing this, it reads further input from the standard input stream (normally the  keyboard),  interpreting
       each  line separately and output to an output device (may be a file or an X11 window preview, see below).
       The interpreter exits gracefully when it encounters the "quit" command (either in  a  file  or  from  the
       keyboard), at end-of-file, or at an interrupt signal (such as Control-C at the keyboard).

       The  interpreter recognizes many option switches, some of which are described below. Please see the usage
       documentation for complete information. Switches may appear anywhere in the command line and apply to all
       files thereafter.  Invoking Ghostscript with the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> switch produces a message which  shows  several
       useful switches, all the devices known to that executable, and the search path for fonts; on Unix it also
       shows the location of detailed documentation.

       Ghostscript  may  be  built  to  use many different output devices.  To see which devices your executable
       includes, run "<b>gs</b> <b>-h</b>".

       Unless you specify a particular device, Ghostscript normally opens the first one  of  those  and  directs
       output to it.

       If  you  have  installed  the  ghostscript-x Debian package and are under X, the default device is an X11
       window (previewer), else ghostscript will use the bbox device and print on stdout the  dimension  of  the
       postscript file.

       So if the first one in the list is the one you want to use, just issue the command

            gs myfile.ps

       You can also check the set of available devices from within Ghostscript: invoke Ghostscript and type

            devicenames ==

       but  the first device on the resulting list may not be the default device you determine with "<b>gs</b> <b>-h</b>".  To
       specify "AbcXyz" as the initial output device, include the switch

            -sDEVICE=AbcXyz

       For example, for output to an Epson printer you might use the command

            gs -sDEVICE=epson myfile.ps

       The "-sDEVICE=" switch must precede the first mention of a file to print, and only the switch's first use
       has any effect.

       Finally, you can specify a default device in the environment variable <b>GS_DEVICE</b>.  The order of precedence
       for these alternatives from highest to lowest (Ghostscript uses the device defined highest in  the  list)
       is:

          setpagedevice
          (command line)
          GS_DEVICE
          (first device in build list)

       Some devices can support different resolutions (densities).  To specify the resolution on such a printer,
       use the "-r" switch:

            gs -sDEVICE=&lt;device&gt; -r&lt;xres&gt;x&lt;yres&gt;

       For example, on a 9-pin Epson-compatible printer, you get the lowest-density (fastest) mode with

            gs -sDEVICE=epson -r60x72

       and the highest-density (best output quality) mode with

            gs -sDEVICE=epson -r240x72.

       If  you  select  a  printer as the output device, Ghostscript also allows you to choose where Ghostscript
       sends the output -- on Unix systems, usually to  a  temporary  file.   To  send  the  output  to  a  file
       "foo.xyz", use the switch

            -sOutputFile=foo.xyz

       You  might  want  to  print  each  page  separately.   To  do  this, send the output to a series of files
       "foo1.xyz, foo2.xyz, ..." using the "-sOutputFile=" switch with "%d" in a filename template:

            -sOutputFile=foo%d.xyz

       Each resulting file receives one page of output, and the files are  numbered  in  sequence.   "%d"  is  a
       printf format specification; you can also use a variant like "%02d".

       You  can  also  send  output to a pipe.  For example, to pipe output to the "<b>lpr</b>" command (which, on many
       Unix systems, directs it to a printer), use the option

            -sOutputFile=%pipe%lpr

       You can also send output to standard output:

            -sOutputFile=-
       or
            -sOutputFile=%stdout%

       In this case you must also use the <b>-q</b> switch, to prevent Ghostscript from writing  messages  to  standard
       output.

       To select a specific paper size, use the command line switch

            -sPAPERSIZE=&lt;paper_size&gt;

       for instance

            -sPAPERSIZE=a4
       or
            -sPAPERSIZE=legal

       Most  ISO  and  US  paper  sizes  are  recognized.  See  the  usage documentation for a full list, or the
       definitions in the initialization file "gs_statd.ps".

       Ghostscript can do many things other than print or view PostScript and PDF files.  For  example,  if  you
       want to know the bounding box of a PostScript (or EPS) file, Ghostscript provides a special "device" that
       just prints out this information.

       For example, using one of the example files distributed with Ghostscript,

            gs -sDEVICE=bbox golfer.ps

       prints out

            %%BoundingBox: 0 25 583 732
            %%HiResBoundingBox: 0.808497 25.009496 582.994503 731.809445

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--</b> <u>filename</u> <u>arg1</u> <u>...</u>
              Takes  the  next argument as a file name as usual, but takes all remaining arguments (even if they
              have the syntactic form  of  switches)  and  defines  the  name  "ARGUMENTS"  in  "userdict"  (not
              "systemdict")  as  an  array of those strings, <b>before</b> running the file.  When Ghostscript finishes
              executing the file, it exits back to the shell.

       <b>-D</b><u>name</u><b>=</b><u>token</u>
       <b>-d</b><u>name</u><b>=</b><u>token</u>
              Define a name in "systemdict" with the given definition.  The token must be exactly one token  (as
              defined by the "token" operator) and may contain no whitespace.

       <b>-D</b><u>name</u>
       <b>-d</b><u>name</u> Define a name in "systemdict" with value=null.

       <b>-S</b><u>name</u><b>=</b><u>string</u>
       <b>-s</b><u>name</u><b>=</b><u>string</u>
              Define  a  name  in  "systemdict"  with  a given string as value.  This is different from <b>-d</b>.  For
              example, <b>-dname=35</b> is equivalent to the program fragment
                   /name 35 def
              whereas <b>-sname=35</b> is equivalent to
                   /name (35) def

       <b>-P</b>     Makes Ghostscript to look  first  in  the  current  directory  for  library  files.   By  default,
              Ghostscript  no  longer  looks  in  the current directory, unless, of course, the first explicitly
              supplied directory is "." in <b>-I</b>.  See also the <b>INITIALIZATION</b> <b>FILES</b>  section  below,  and  bundled
              <b>Use.htm</b> for detailed discussion on search paths and how Ghostcript finds files.

       <b>-q</b>     Quiet startup: suppress normal startup messages, and also do the equivalent of <b>-dQUIET</b>.

       <b>-g</b><u>number1</u><b>x</b><u>number2</u>
              Equivalent  to  <b>-dDEVICEWIDTH=</b><u>number1</u>  and  <b>-dDEVICEHEIGHT=</b><u>number2</u>.   This  is  for the benefit of
              devices (such as X11 windows) that require (or allow) width and height to be specified.

       <b>-r</b><u>number</u>
       <b>-r</b><u>number1</u><b>x</b><u>number2</u>
              Equivalent to  <b>-dDEVICEXRESOLUTION=</b><u>number1</u>  and  <b>-dDEVICEYRESOLUTION=</b><u>number2</u>.   This  is  for  the
              benefit of devices such as printers that support multiple X and Y resolutions.  If only one number
              is given, it is used for both X and Y resolutions.

       <b>-I</b><u>directories</u>
              Adds the designated list of directories at the head of the search path for library files.

       <b>-</b>      This  is  not  really  a switch, but indicates to Ghostscript that standard input is coming from a
              file or a pipe and not interactively from the command line.  Ghostscript reads from standard input
              until it reaches end-of-file, executing it like any other file, and then continues with processing
              the command line.  When the command line has been entirely  processed,  Ghostscript  exits  rather
              than going into its interactive mode.

       Note  that  the  normal  initialization  file "gs_init.ps" makes "systemdict" read-only, so the values of
       names defined with <b>-D</b>, <b>-d</b>, <b>-S</b>, or <b>-s</b> cannot be changed (although, of course, they can  be  superseded  by
       definitions in "userdict" or other dictionaries.)

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-dNOCACHE</b>
              Disables character caching.  Useful only for debugging.

       <b>-dNOBIND</b>
              Disables the "bind" operator.  Useful only for debugging.

       <b>-dNODISPLAY</b>
              Suppresses the normal initialization of the output device.  This may be useful when debugging.

       <b>-dNOPAUSE</b>
              Disables  the  prompt  and  pause at the end of each page.  This may be desirable for applications
              where another program is driving Ghostscript.

       <b>-dNOPLATFONTS</b>
              Disables the use of fonts supplied by the underlying platform (for instance X Windows).  This  may
              be needed if the platform fonts look undesirably different from the scalable fonts.

       <b>-dSAFER</b>
              Restricts file operations the job can perform. Now the default mode of operation.

       <b>-dWRITESYSTEMDICT</b>
              Leaves  "systemdict"  writable.   This  is necessary when running special utility programs, but is
              strongly discouraged as it bypasses normal Postscript security measures.

       <b>-sDEVICE=</b><u>device</u>
              Selects an alternate initial output device, as described above.

       <b>-sOutputFile=</b><u>filename</u>
              Selects an alternate output file (or pipe) for the initial output device, as described above.

</pre><h4><b>SAFER</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-dSAFER</b> option restricts file system accesses to those files and directories allowed by the  relevant
       environment    variables    (such    as    GS_LIB)    or    by   the   command   line   parameters   (see
       https://ghostscript.com/doc/current/Use.htm for details).

       SAFER mode is now the default mode of operation. Thus when running programs that need to  open  files  or
       set restricted parameters you should pass the <b>-dNOSAFER</b> command line option or its synonym <b>-dDELAYSAFER</b>.

       Running  with NOSAFER/DELAYSAFER (as the same suggests) loosens the security and is thus recommended ONLY
       for debugging or in VERY controlled workflows, and strongly NOT recommended in any other circumstances.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The locations of many Ghostscript run-time files are compiled into the executable when it is built.   Run
       "<b>gs</b>  <b>-h</b>"  to  find  the location of Ghostscript documentation on your system, from which you can get more
       details. On a Debian system they are in <b><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></b>.

       <b>/usr/share/ghostscript/[0-9]*.[0.9]*/*</b>
              Startup files, utilities, and basic font  definitions  (where  [0-9]*.[0.9]*  is  the  ghostscript
              version)

       <b>/usr/share/fonts/type1/gsfonts/*</b>
              More font definitions from the gsfonts package

       <b>/usr/share/doc/ghostscript/examples/*</b>
              Ghostscript demonstration files (if ghostscript-doc package is installed)

       <b>/usr/share/doc/ghostscript/*</b>
              Diverse document files (may need to install ghostscript-doc package)

</pre><h4><b>INITIALIZATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       When  looking  for  the  initialization  files "gs_*.ps", the files related to fonts, or the file for the
       "run" operator, Ghostscript first tries to open the file with  the  name  as  given,  using  the  current
       working  directory  if  no  directory  is specified.  If this fails, and the file name doesn't specify an
       explicit directory or drive (for instance, doesn't  contain  "/"  on  Unix  systems),  Ghostscript  tries
       directories in this order:

       1.  the directories specified by the <b>-I</b> switches in the command line (see below), if any;

       2.  the directories specified by the <b>GS_LIB</b> environment variable, if any;

       3.  the directories specified by the <b>GS_LIB_DEFAULT</b> macro in the Ghostscript makefile when the executable
           was  built.   <b>GS_LIB_DEFAULT</b>  is  "/usr/share/ghostscript/[0-9]*.[0-9]*<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a>" on a Debian system where
           "[0-9]*.[0-9]*" represents the Ghostscript version number

       Each of these (<b>GS_LIB_DEFAULT</b>, <b>GS_LIB</b>, and <b>-I</b> parameter) may be either a single directory or  a  list  of
       directories separated by ":".

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>GS_OPTIONS</b>
              String of options to be processed before the command line options

       <b>GS_DEVICE</b>
              Used to specify an output device

       <b>GS_FONTPATH</b>
              Path names used to search for fonts

       <b>GS_LIB</b> Path names for initialization files and fonts

       <b>TEMP</b>   Where temporary files are made

</pre><h4><b>X</b> <b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       Ghostscript, or more properly the X11 display device, looks for the following resources under the program
       name "Ghostscript":

       <b>borderWidth</b>
              The border width in pixels (default = 1).

       <b>borderColor</b>
              The name of the border color (default = black).

       <b>geometry</b>
              The window size and placement, WxH+X+Y (default is NULL).

       <b>xResolution</b>
              The number of x pixels per inch (default is computed from <b>WidthOfScreen</b> and <b>WidthMMOfScreen</b>).

       <b>yResolution</b>
              The number of y pixels per inch (default is computed from <b>HeightOfScreen</b> and <b>HeightMMOfScreen</b>).

       <b>useBackingPixmap</b>
              Determines whether backing store is to be used for saving display window (default = true).

       See  the  usage document for a more complete list of resources.  To set these resources on Unix, put them
       in a file such as "<a href="file:~/.Xresources">~/.Xresources</a>" in the following form:

            Ghostscript*geometry:     612x792-0+0
            Ghostscript*xResolution: 72
            Ghostscript*yResolution: 72

       Then merge these resources into the X server's resource database:

            % xrdb -merge <a href="file:~/.Xresources">~/.Xresources</a>

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The various Ghostscript document files (above), especially <b>Use.htm</b>.  On Debian you may  need  to  install
       ghostscript-doc before reading the documentation.
