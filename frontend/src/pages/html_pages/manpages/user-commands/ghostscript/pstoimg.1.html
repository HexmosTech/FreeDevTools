</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The command line options may be abbreviated to the shortest unique prefix.

       <b>-help</b>
           Show this help page and exit.

       <b>-version</b>
           Show the release and version of pstoimg and exit.

       <b>-antialias</b>
           Use  Ghostscript's  anti-aliasing  feature  for rendering "softer" images.  This applies to lines and
           edges of polygonal and oval or circular  shapes.   Only  valid  if  Ghostscript  4.03  or  higher  is
           installed.

       <b>-aaliastext</b>
           Use  Ghostscript's  anti-aliasing  feature  for "smoother" font characters, without the jagged edges.
           Similar to <b>-antialias</b> for graphic components.  Only valid if Ghostscript 4.03 or higher is installed.

       <b>-center</b> <u>num</u>
           Add the appropriate amount of whitespace to the left of the image so that the  image  appears  to  be
           centered in a total width of <u>num</u> pixels.

       <b>-crop</b> <u>code</u>
           Crop  the  bitmap  from  the given directions. <u>code</u> may be a string of several cropping instructions,
           which are executed strictly in the given order. Possible values are: <b>h</b> (horizontal, i.e. crop top and
           bottom), <b>v</b> (vertical), <b>tblr</b> (top, bottom, left, right) and <b>a</b> (all directions). A special case  is  <b>s</b>:
           "shave" the image at the bottom, but only if a single line of whitespace exists.

       <b>-debug</b>
           Turn  on  debugging  output.  This  can  get rather verbose. Any intermediate files generated are not
           removed to help debugging.

       <b>-density</b> <u>num</u>
           The density (resolution) in DPI in which to render the bitmap. The default is 72.

       <b>-depth</b> <u>num</u> or <b>-color</b> <u>num</u>
           Specify the color depth of the bitmap. Legal values are 1 (black &amp; white),  8  (256  colors)  and  24
           (true color).

       <b>-discard</b>
           Delete the input postscript file if the conversion was successful. Setting the environment DISCARD to
           a true value (as perl sees it) has the same effect.

       <b>-flip</b> <u>code</u>
           Flip all generated output bitmaps. The following codes are recognized: lr (flip left-right), tb (flip
           top-bottom),  xy  (flip  bottom/left-top/right), r90 and ccw (rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise),
           r270 and cw (rotate 90 degrees clockwise) and r180 (rotate 180 degrees).

       <b>-geometry</b> <u>X</u>x<u>Y</u>
           Render only this "window" of the PostScript file. If  given,  this  option  can  dramatically  reduce
           memory  requirements  and  speed up conversion. The geometry is automatically detected in case of EPS
           files (Encapsulated PostScript).

       <b>-interlaced</b>
           Generate an interlaced bitmap. Interlaced images build up from coarse to fine  as  they  are  loaded.
           This  option  may not work on every installation and/or bitmap type, depending of the capabilities of
           external programs.

       <b>-margins</b> <u>X</u>,<u>Y</u>
           The offset of the rectangle in the postscript file that is going to be rendered from top/left. Can be
           used together with <b>-geometry</b> to further reduce the size of the intermediate bitmap file generated  by
           Ghostscript.

       <b>-multipage</b>
           Process  a multi-page PostScript file, i.e. create an individual bitmap for every page. The resulting
           files are numbered: The decimal number  (starting  with  1)  is  appended  to  the  basename  of  the
           PostScript  input  file  (or  the  basename  of  the filename specified with <b>-out</b>), while keeping the
           extension.

       <b>-out</b> <u>file</u>
           The file where to write the bitmap. If multiple PostScript files are supplied on  the  command  line,
           this  option is ignored. The bitmap type extension is appended automatically if <u>file</u> does not contain
           a dot.  In connection with <b>-multipage</b> <u>file</u> is extended by the page number as shown in this example:

           -outfile foo.gif  --------&gt; foo1.gif, foo2.gif, ...

       <b>-quiet</b>
           Do not print anything except error messages.

       <b>-rightjustify</b> <u>num</u>
           Add the appropriate amount of whitespace to the left of the image so that it appears to be aligned to
           the right in a total width of <u>num</u> pixels.

       <b>-scale</b> <u>factor</u>
           Scale the image by <u>factor</u>. Valid choices are any  numbers  greater  than  zero.  Useful  choices  are
           numbers  between  0.1  -  5.   Large numbers may generate very large intermediate files and will take
           longer to process. If this option is omitted, the environment SCALE is considered.

       <b>-shoreup</b> <u>num</u>[<b>d</b>]
           Make height and width of the bitmap(s) an exact multiple of <u>num</u>. If <u>num</u> is followed by  a  "d",  then
           half  the  extra  vertical  space  is  placed  underneath. This option is useful, if you want to have
           "blown-up" images of high quality  for  print,  but  downscale  them  in  HTML  using  "&lt;IMG  WIDTH=x
           HEIGHT=y&gt;".  If  the  actual image is is not an integer multiple of x,y then browsers tend to display
           distorted images.

       <b>-tmp</b> <u>path</u>
           Use <u>path</u> to store temporary files. Defaults to <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> on this installation. This parameter can  be  set
           by the environment <b>TMP</b> or <b>TEMP</b>, too.

       <b>-topjustify</b> [<b>x</b>]<u>num</u>
           Add  padding whitespace to the image so that it gets a defined height.  If an integer value is given,
           it defines the total height. The whitespace is added at the bottom. If the number is preceded by "x",
           then this multiple of the image height is added as whitespace at the bottom.

       <b>-transparent</b>
           Generate transparent bitmaps, i.e. the background color (white) is transparent if viewed with certain
           viewers (e.g. browsers). This option may not be available due to  missing  capabilities  of  external
           programs.

       <b>-type</b> <u>type</u>
           Instruct pstoimg to render the bitmap in <u>type</u> format. Depending on the local installation, pstoimg is
           capable of generating either GIF or PNG bitmaps. This site features the following types: png gif

           If omitted, the first type in this list is taken.

       <b>-white</b>
           Remove  TeX's  page  color  information  from  the  PostScript file before converting so that a white
           background is used.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pstoimg</b> iterates over the given input  files  and  runs  them  through  Ghostscript.  The  resulting  pnm
       (portable  anymap  files)  are  processed with different Netpbm tools (cropping, color mapping, aligning,
       ...)  and finally converted into (currently) either GIF or PNG format. The bitmaps can  now  be  included
       e.g. in WWW pages.

       The  PostScript  file  is  converted as is. If a valid bounding box is found (EPS format), then only this
       area is converted. The image is <u>not</u> cropped by default.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       0   if everything went all right

       x   (x != 0) something went wrong. See the message output.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       "pstoimg foo.ps"
           Convert the first page of foo.ps to the default bitmap type.

       "pstoimg -type png -crop a -trans -interlace foo.ps"
           Same as above, but force png output and crop all the whitespace around the image and make  the  color
           white transparent and generate an interlaced bitmap.

       "pstoimg -multi -out bar -type gif -crop a foo.ps"
           Consider foo.ps a multiple page PostScript file and create output files bar1.gif, bar2.gif, etc.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       DENSITY, DEPTH, DEBUG, DISCARD
           See <b>-density</b>, <b>-depth</b>, <b>-debug</b>, <b>-discard</b>, respectively.

       GS_LIB
           This variable is set to the path(s) where Ghostscript libraries have been found on this system during
           configuration,  but  only if the built-in paths are not correct. This fixes the problem of relocation
           that is quite common on Win32 installations. This  behavior  can  be  overridden  by  setting  GS_LIB
           manually before starting pstoimg.

       LATEX2HTMLDIR
           The   directory   where   the   LaTeX2HTML   library   and  perl  modules  are  found.   Defaults  to
           "/usr/share/latex2html" on this installation.

       OUTFILE
           Setting this has the same effect as specifying <b>-out</b>. Please do not rely on this feature any more,  it
           will disappear from the next releases!

       PAPERSIZE
           The papersize to use by Ghostscript to render the image. pstoimg tries hard to optimize for rendering
           on  the smallest possible bitmap size.  Still this option is there to enable tuning by hand, although
           it is deprecated. If pstoimg finds a better setting, this parameter is ignored.

       SCALE
           See the discussion of <b>-scale</b>.

       TMP and TEMP
           Unless overridden by <b>-tmp</b>, these variables denote a directory where to store temporary files. TMP  is
           considered first, then TEMP.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       gs, pnmcrop, pnmquant, pbmmake, pnmcat, pnmfile, pnmflip, ppmtogif, pnmtopng, giftool, giftrans.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Several  people  have  suggested to use ImageMagick's convert instead of pstoimg. A few comments on this:
       convert uses (of course) Ghostscript for conversion of PostScript to bitmap, so one still needs  gs.  And
       for the special requirements of LaTeX2HTML convert's features are not sufficient. The ImageMagick toolset
       has everything in place, but it has some overhead that can prove killing when processing some 100 images.
       pstoimg  only  does  what  it really has to, so it should be quite efficient. Don't get me wrong - I like
       ImageMagick, but not in the context of LaTeX2HTML.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       This utility is automatically configured and built to work on the local  setup.  If  this  setup  changes
       (e.g. some of the external commands are moved), the script has be be reconfigured.

       Despite  the  portability  of perl, a pstoimg configured on UNIX will probably not work on Win32 and vice
       versa.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Please report bugs to <a href="mailto:latex2html@tug.org">latex2html@tug.org</a>, stating the (debug) output of pstoimg, your  perl  version  and
       the  versions  of  the  external  tools.   Best is to include the cfgcache.pm file from the configuration
       procedure.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       This  script  went  through  a  long  evolution,  beginning  with  a  modification  of   Doug   Crabill's
       &lt;<a href="mailto:dgc@cs.purdue.edu">dgc@cs.purdue.edu</a>&gt;   ps2epsi   script.    The   first   perl   version   was   done   by   Nikos  Drakos
       &lt;<a href="mailto:nikos@cbl.leeds.ac.uk">nikos@cbl.leeds.ac.uk</a>&gt;.  It was  gradually  improved  by  numerous  LaTeX2HTML  developers:  Ross  Moore
       &lt;<a href="mailto:ross@maths.mq.edu.au">ross@maths.mq.edu.au</a>&gt;, Jens Lippmann &lt;<a href="mailto:lippmann@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de">lippmann@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de</a>&gt; and others (sorry for not
       mentioning everyone and thanks for your contributions).
