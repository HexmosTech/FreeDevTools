</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpgv</b> - Verify OpenPGP signatures

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpgv</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>signed_files</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpgv</b> is an OpenPGP signature verification tool.

       This  program  is  actually  a stripped-down version of <b>gpg</b> which is only able to check signatures. It is
       somewhat smaller than the fully-blown <b>gpg</b> and uses a different (and simpler) way to check that the public
       keys used to make the signature are valid. There are no configuration files and only a  few  options  are
       implemented.

       <b>gpgv</b>  assumes  that  all keys in the keyring are trustworthy.  That does also mean that it does not check
       for expired or revoked keys.

       If no <b>--keyring</b> option is given, <b>gpgv</b> looks for a ``default'' keyring named ‘<u>trustedkeys.kbx</u>’ (preferred)
       or ‘<u>trustedkeys.gpg</u>’ in the home directory of GnuPG, either the default home directory or the one set  by
       the  <b>--homedir</b>  option or the <b>GNUPGHOME</b> environment variable.  If any <b>--keyring</b> option is used, <b>gpgv</b> will
       not look for the default keyring. The <b>--keyring</b> option may be  used  multiple  times  and  all  specified
       keyrings will be used together.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  returns 0 if everything is fine, 1 if at least one signature was bad, and other error codes
       for fatal errors.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpgv</b> recognizes these options:

       <b>--verbose</b>
       <b>-v</b>     Gives more information during processing. If used twice, the input data is listed in detail.

       <b>--quiet</b>
       <b>-q</b>     Try to be as quiet as possible.

       <b>--keyring</b> <u>file</u>
              Add <u>file</u> to the list of keyrings.  If <u>file</u> begins with a tilde and a slash, these are replaced  by
              the  HOME  directory.  If  the filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the home-
              directory ("<a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a>" if --homedir is not used).

       <b>--output</b> <u>file</u>
       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>
              Write output to <u>file</u>; to write to stdout use <b>-</b>.  This option can be used to get  the  signed  text
              from a cleartext or binary signature; it also works for detached signatures, but in that case this
              option is in general not useful.  Note that an existing file will be overwritten.

       <b>--status-fd</b> <u>n</u>
              Write  special status strings to the file descriptor <u>n</u>.  See the file DETAILS in the documentation
              for a listing of them.

       <b>--logger-fd</b> <b>n</b>
              Write log output to file descriptor <b>n</b> and not to stderr.

       <b>--log-file</b> <b>file</b>
              Same as <b>--logger-fd</b>, except the logger data is written to file <b>file</b>.  Use ‘<u>socket://</u>’  to  log  to
              socket.

       <b>--ignore-time-conflict</b>
              GnuPG  normally  checks  that  the  timestamps  associated with keys and signatures have plausible
              values. However, sometimes a signature seems to be older than the key due to clock problems.  This
              option turns these checks into warnings.

       <b>--homedir</b> <u>dir</u>
              Set the name of the home directory to <u>dir</u>. If this option is not used, the home directory defaults
              to  ‘<u><a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a></u>’.  It is only recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any home
              directory stated through the environment variable ‘<u>GNUPGHOME</u>’ or (on Windows systems) by means  of
              the Registry entry <u>HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir</u>.

              On  Windows  systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable application.  In this case only
              this command line option is considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

       <b>--weak-digest</b> <b>name</b>
              Treat the specified digest algorithm as weak.  Signatures made over weak  digests  algorithms  are
              normally  rejected.  This  option  can be supplied multiple times if multiple algorithms should be
              considered weak.  MD5 is always considered weak, and does not need to be listed explicitly.

       <b>--enable-special-filenames</b>
              This option enables a mode in which filenames of the form ‘<u>-&amp;n</u>’, where n is a non-negative decimal
              number, refer to the file descriptor n and not to a file with that name.

       <b>--assert-pubkey-algo</b> <u>algolist</u>
              This option works in the same way as described for <b>gpg</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpgv</b> <b>pgpfile</b>
       <b>gpgv</b> <b>sigfile</b> <b>[datafile]</b>
              Verify the signature of the file. The second form is used for detached signatures,  where  <b>sigfile</b>
              is  the detached signature (either ASCII-armored or binary) and <b>datafile</b> contains the signed data;
              if <b>datafile</b> is "-" the signed data is expected on <b>stdin</b>; if <b>datafile</b> is not given the name of  the
              file  holding  the  signed  data  is  constructed  by cutting off the extension (".asc", ".sig" or
              ".sign") from <b>sigfile</b>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="file:~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg">~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg</a></b>
              The default keyring with the allowed keys.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>HOME</b>   Used to locate the default home directory.

       <b>GNUPGHOME</b>
              If set directory used instead of "<a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a>".

       The full documentation for this tool is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If GnuPG and  the  info  program
       are properly installed at your site, the command

         info gnupg

       should give you access to the complete manual including a menu structure and an index.
