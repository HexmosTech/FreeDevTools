</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xar - eXtensible ARchiver

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATION</b> <b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xar</b>  is  no  longer  under  active development by Apple. Clients of xar should pursue alternative archive
       formats.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xar</b> -[<u>ctx</u>][<u>v</u>] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The XAR project aims to provide an easily extensible archive format. Important design  decisions  include
       an  easily extensible XML table of contents (TOC) for random access to archived files, storing the TOC at
       the beginning of the archive to allow for efficient handling of streamed archives, the ability to  handle
       files of arbitrarily large sizes, the ability to choose independent encodings for individual files in the
       archive,  the  ability  to store checksums for individual files in both compressed and uncompressed form,
       and the ability to query the table of content's rich meta-data.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>options</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>used:</b>

       -c     Creates an archive

       -t     Lists the contents of an archive

       -x     Extracts an archive

       <b>NOTE:</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> <b>require</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>-f</b> <b>option</b> <b>(filename)</b> <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>xar</b> <b>doesn't</b>
       <b>correctly</b> <b>handle</b> <b>pipes</b> <b>or</b> <b>sockets.</b>

       -f     The filename to use for creation, listing or extraction.  With extraction, this  can  be  a  POSIX
              regular expression.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --compression
              Specifies  the  compression type to use.  Valid values: none, gzip, bzip2, lzma (on some systems).
              Default value: gzip

       -C &lt;path&gt;
              On extract, xar will chdir to the specified path before extracting the archive.

       -a     Synonym for --compression=lzma

       -j     Synonym for --compression=bzip2

       -z     Synonym for --compression=gzip

       --compression-args=&lt;arguments&gt;
              Specifies arguments to the compression engine selected.  gzip, bzip2, and lzma all take  a  single
              integer argument between 0 and 9 specifying the compression level to use.

       --dump-toc=&lt;filename&gt;
              Has xar dump the xml header into the specified file.  "-" can be specified to mean stdout.

       --dump-toc-cksum
              Dumps the ToC checksum to stdout along with the algorithm of the ToC.

       --dump-header
              Has xar print out the xar binary header information to stdout.

       --extract-subdoc=&lt;name&gt;
              Extracts the specified subdocument to a document in cwd named &lt;name&gt;.xml

       --list-subdocs
              List the subdocuments in the xml header

       --toc-cksum
              Specifies  the  hashing  algorithm to use for xml header verification.  Valid values: md5 (on some
              systems), sha1, sha256, and sha512.  Default value: sha1

       --file-cksum
              Specifies the hashing algorithm to use for file content verification.  Valid values: md5 (on  some
              systems), sha1, sha256, and sha512.  Default value: sha1

       -l     On archival, stay on the local device.

       -P     On  extract,  set  ownership  based  on uid/gid.  If the uid/gid can be set on the extracted file,
              setuid/setgid bits will also be preserved.

       -p     On extract, set ownership based on symbolic names, if possible.  If the uid/gid can be set on  the
              extracted file, setuid/setgid bits will also be preserved.

       -s &lt;filename&gt;
              On  extract, specifies the file to extract subdocuments to.  On archival, specifies an xml file to
              add as a subdocument.

       -v     Verbose output

       --exclude
              Specifies a POSIX regular expression of files  to  exclude  from  adding  to  the  archive  during
              creation or from being extracted during extraction.  This option can be specified multiple times.

       --rsize
              Specifies a size (in bytes) for the internal libxar read buffer while performing I/O.

       --coalesce-heap
              When  multiple  files  in  the archive are identical, only store one copy of the data in the heap.
              This creates smaller archives, but the archives created are not streamable.

       --link-same
              When the data section of multiple files are identical, hardlink them within the archive.

       --no-compress
              Specifies a POSIX regular expression of files to archive, but not compress.   The  archived  files
              will be copied raw into the archive.  This can be used to exclude already gzipped files from being
              gzipped during the archival process.

       --prop-include
              Specifies  a file property to be included in the archive.  When this option is specified, only the
              specified options will be included.  Anything not specifically included with this option  will  be
              omitted.  This option can be used multiple times.

       --prop-exclude
              Specifies  a  file  property  to be excluded from the archive.  When this option is specified, all
              file properties will be included except  the  specified  properties.   This  option  can  be  used
              multiple times.

       --distribution
              Creates  an  archive  to only contain file properties safe for file distribution.  Currently, only
              name, type, mode, and data are preserved with this option.

       --keep-existing
              Does not overwrite existing files during extraction.  Keeps any previously  existing  files  while
              extracting.

       -k     Synonym for --keep-existing.

       --keep-setuid
              When  extracting without -p or -P options, xar will extract files as the uid/gid of the extracting
              process.  In this situation, xar will strip  setuid/setgid  bits  from  the  extracted  files  for
              security  reasons.   --keep-setuid will preserve the setuid/setgid bits even though the uid/gid of
              the extracted file is not the same as the archived file.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       xar -cf sample.xar /home/uid
              Create a xar archive of all files in /home/uid

       xar -tf sample.xar
              List the contents of the xar archive sample.xar

       xar -xf sample.xar
              Extract the contents of sample.xar to the current working directory

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Doesn't currently work with pipes or streams.  Might be fixed in a future release.

       Probably one or two more somewhere in there. If you find one please report it to
